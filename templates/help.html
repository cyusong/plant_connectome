          We used GPT to evaluate research abstracts and identify pairs of entities (e.g., genes, proteins, molecules, 
          compartments, complexes) in addition to their unique interaction type (e.g., enhances, binds, affects, represses).
          <br> <br>
          For instance, after examining the abstract
          <blockquote>
            "In plants, regulation of cellulose synthesis is fundamental for morphogenesis and plant growth. 
            Cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane, and the orientation of synthesis is guided by cortical 
            microtubules; however, the guiding mechanism is currently unknown. We show that the conditional root elongation 
            pom2 mutants are impaired in cell elongation, fertility, and microtubule-related functions. Map-based cloning of 
            the POM-POM2 locus revealed that it is allelic to CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTING1 (CSI1). Fluorescently tagged 
            POM2/CSI1s associated with both plasma membrane-located cellulose synthases (CESAs) and post-Golgi CESA-containing 
            compartments. Interestingly, while CESA insertions coincided with cortical microtubules in the pom2/csi1 mutants, 
            the microtubule-defined movement of the CESAs was significantly reduced in the mutant. We propose that POM2/CSI1 provides 
            a scaffold between the CESAs and cortical microtubules that guide cellulose synthesis."
          </blockquote>
          GPT returned the following statements:
          <ol>
            <li> Cellulose: !synthesized at! Plasma Membrane </li>
            <li> Cortical Microtubules: !guide! Cellulose Synthesis </li>
            <li> POM2/CSI1: !associates with! CESAs </li>

        <p>
          Because PlantConnectome is built from processed abstracts, gene identifiers such as AT4G32410 may not be interpretable by GPT. Instead, search with
          gene symbols (e.g., CESA1), as these are used in the literature.
          <br> <br>
          You can also choose to search for <strong>terms</strong> mentioned in the abstracts (for instance, "proline", "cold", "root hair", etc.), <strong>author names</strong>, or <strong>PubMed IDs</strong>.

        <p>
          To ensure PlantConnectome reflects state-of-the-art knowledge, all research papers from which it derives were published <strong>after 2004</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Journals were carefully selected by analyzing genes with experimentally verified functions (e.g., TAIR), allowing us to shortlist articles covering 
          functional information on plant genes.

          Non-plant-specific journals (e.g., PNAS, Cell, etc.) were harvested only for their publications examining plants.

          As with any AI model, GPT is not 100% accurate, generating results that may be erroneous or incomplete. Accordingly, relationships of interest warrant confirmation with the appropriate abstract. Stay tuned for a complete benchmark of the inferences, which we are currently working on.
