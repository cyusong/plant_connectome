['31968122', 'Iron (Fe) transport and utilization are controlled by Fe-dependent  transcriptional cascades. Many genes participate in these processes,  transcriptionally controlled by Fe-status. Thorough knowledge of the  translational check-points is lacking. We identified a non-response to  Fe-deficiency1-1 (nrf1-1) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which displayed a  hypersensitive phenotype under Fe-deficient conditions. By mapping nrf1-1, we  found that the AT3G13440 locus encoding a HemK methyltransferase is responsible  for the phenotype. Analyses of ProUBQ10:NRF1(CDS) overexpression nrf1-1 lines and  a T-DNA insertion mutant nrf1-2, confirmed that loss-of-function of NRF1 results  in enhanced Fe-starvation-sensitivity. NRF1 is required for the proper expression  of the majority of Fe-deficiency-inducible (FDI) genes. The nrf1 mutants  accumulated more polysomes in the roots, due to stalled ribosomes on several  transcripts. Ribosome-footprint (RF) mapping revealed that ribosomes are stalled  at a stop codon that amplified the stalling of trailing ribosomes. We detected  higher RF levels in many FDI transcripts in nrf1-2. Our study demonstrates the  requirement of NRF1 for an accurate termination of protein synthesis essential  not only for a precise iron homeostasis, but also cellular ion balance. NRF1 is  also important for normal growth and development. A check-point that fine-tunes  peptide release in plants is uncovered.', '2020 Jun', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.16440', 'ORCID:']
