Chloroplast biogenesis and development are highly complex processes requiring interaction between plastid and nuclear genomic products. Using a high-throughput screen for chloroplast biogenesis suppressors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we identified a <i>suppressor of thf1</i> (<i>sot5</i>) that displays virescent and serrated leaves. Further characterization revealed that <i>sot5</i> mutants are defective in leaf adaxial and abaxial polarity and act as enhancers of <i>asymmetric leaves2</i> Map-based cloning identified <i>SOT5</i> as a gene previously named <i>EMB2279</i> that encodes a plastid-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein with 11 PPR motifs. A G-to-A mutation in <i>sot5</i> leads to a significant decrease in splicing efficiency, generating two additional mRNA variants. As reported previously, the <i>sot5</i> null mutation is embryo lethal. SOT5 is predicted to bind to specific RNA sequences found in plastid <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes, and we found decreased splicing efficiency of the <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes in <i>sot5</i> mutants. Together, our results reveal that the PPR protein SOT5/EMB2279 is required for intron splicing of plastid <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i>, providing insights into the role of plastid translation in the coupled development between chloroplasts and leaves.
