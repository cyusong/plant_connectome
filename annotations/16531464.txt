Root hair formation is an important model with which to study cell patterning and differentiation in higher plants. Ethylene and auxin are critical regulators of root hair development. The role of jasmonates (JAs) was examined in Arabidopsis root hair development as well as their interactions with ethylene in this process. The results have shown that both methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and jasmonic acid (JA) have a pronounced effect on promoting root hair formation. However, the effect of MeJA and JA on root hair formation was blocked by ethylene inhibitors Ag+ or aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG). The stimulatory effects of MeJA and JA were also diminished in ethylene-insensitive mutants etr1-1 and etr1-3. Furthermore, the JA biosynthesis inhibitors ibuprofen and salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) suppressed 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)-induced root hair formation, and decreased the root hairs in seedlings of the ethylene over-producing mutant eto1-1. These results suggested that JAs promote root hair formation, through an interaction with ethylene.
