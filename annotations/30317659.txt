Symbiotic nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub> ) fixation plays a vital role in sustainable agriculture. Efficient N<sub>2</sub> fixation requires various materials, including phosphate (Pi); however, the molecular mechanism underlying the transport of Pi into nodules and bacteroids remains largely unknown. A nodule-localized Pi transporter, GmPT7, was functionally characterized in soybean (Glycine max) and its role in N<sub>2</sub> fixation and yield was investigated via composite and whole transgenic plants. GmPT7 protein was localized to the plasma membrane and showed transport activity for Pi in yeast. Altered expression of GmPT7 changed <sup>33</sup> Pi uptake from rhizosphere and translocation to bacteroids. GmPT7 was mainly localized to the outer cortex and fixation zones of the nodules. Overexpression of GmPT7 promoted nodulation, and increased plant biomass, shoot nitrogen and phosphorus content, resulting in improved soybean yield by up to 36%. Double suppression of GmPT5 and GmPT7 led to nearly complete elimination of nodulation and over 50% reduction in plant biomass, shoot nitrogen and phosphorus content, indicating that both GmPT7 and GmPT5 contribute to Pi transport for N<sub>2</sub> fixation. Taken together, our results indicate that GmPT7 is a transporter responsible for direct Pi entry to nodules and further to fixation zones, which is required for enhancing symbiotic N<sub>2</sub> fixation and grain yield of soybean.
