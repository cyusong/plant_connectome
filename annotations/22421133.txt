['22421133', 'Among the biological phenomena that fall within the emerging field of "quantum  biology" is the suggestion that magnetically sensitive chemical reactions are  responsible for the magnetic compass of migratory birds. It has been proposed  that transient radical pairs are formed by photo-induced electron transfer  reactions in cryptochrome proteins and that their coherent spin dynamics are  influenced by the geomagnetic field leading to changes in the quantum yield of  the signaling state of the protein. Despite a variety of supporting evidence, it  is still not clear whether cryptochromes have the properties required to respond  to magnetic interactions orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal energy,  k(B)T. Here we demonstrate that the kinetics and quantum yields of photo-induced  flavin-tryptophan radical pairs in cryptochrome are indeed magnetically  sensitive. The mechanistic origin of the magnetic field effect is clarified, its  dependence on the strength of the magnetic field measured, and the rates of  relevant spin-dependent, spin-independent, and spin-decoherence processes  determined. We argue that cryptochrome is fit for purpose as a chemical  magnetoreceptor.', '2012 Mar 27', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1118959109', 'Hore']
