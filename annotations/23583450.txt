Several positive transcription factors regulate Arabidopsis anthocyanin biosynthesis. HY5, a component of light-signaling pathways, and PAP1, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, share common regulatory targets on anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. The epistatic interactions between the two transcription factors are currently unknown. To address this problem, we analyzed crosses between hy5 and pap1 mutants (hy5pap1) or pap1D overexpressors (hy5pap1D), performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR, and determined the PAP1 promoter region through deletion analysis. The results show that HY5 regulates PAP1 expression via direct binding to G- and ACE-boxes in the promoter region, which suggests bifurcate regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis by HY5 via transcriptional activation of PAP1.

HY5: !regulates! PAP1
HY5: !binds to! G- and ACE-boxes
PAP1: !shares common regulatory targets! anthocyanin biosynthesis genes
HY5: !activates! PAP1
