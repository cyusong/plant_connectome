The fields of plant water relations and plant biomechanics have traditionally been studied separately even though often the same tissues are responsible for water transport and mechanical support. There is now increasing evidence that hydraulic and mechanical adaptations may influence one another. We studied the changes in the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the wood along lateral roots of two species of buttressed trees. In these roots, the mechanical contstraints quantified by strain measurements are known to decrease distally. Further, we investigated the effect of mechanical loading on the vessel anatomy in these and four other species of tropical trees. We found that as the strain decreased, the wood became progressively less stiff and strong but the conductivity increased exponentially. This was reflected in that adaptations towards re-enforcing mechanically loaded areas resulted in xylem with fewer and smaller vessels. In addition a controlled growth experiment on three tree species showed that drought adaptation may results in plants with stronger and stiffer tissue. Our results indicate that hydraulic and mechanical stress adaptations may be interrelated, and so support recent studied suggesting that physiological responses are complex balances rather than pure optimisations.
