['11003848', "Sexual reproduction in plants, unlike that of animals, requires the action of  multicellular haploid gametophytes. The male gametophyte (pollen tube) is guided  to a female gametophyte through diploid sporophytic cells in the pistil. While  interactions between the pollen tube and diploid cells have been described,  little is known about the intercellular recognition systems between the pollen  tube and the female gametophyte. In particular, the mechanisms that enable only  one pollen tube to interact with each female gametophyte, thereby preventing  polysperm, are not understood. We isolated female gametophyte mutants named  magatama (maa) from Arabidopsis thaliana by screening for siliques containing  half the normal number of mature seeds. In maa1 and maa3 mutants, in which the  development of the female gametophyte was delayed, pollen tube guidance was  affected. Pollen tubes were directed to mutant female gametophytes, but they lost  their way just before entering the micropyle and elongated in random directions.  Moreover, the mutant female gametophytes attracted two pollen tubes at a high  frequency. To explain the interaction between gametophytes, we propose a monogamy  model in which a female gametophyte emits two attractants and prevents  polyspermy. This prevention process by the female gametophyte could increase a  plant's inclusive fitness by facilitating the fertilization of sibling female  gametophytes. In addition, repulsion between pollen tubes might help prevent  polyspermy. The reproductive isolations observed in interspecific crosses in  Brassicaceae are also consistent with the monogamy model.", '2000 Oct', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.127.20.4511', 'Okada']
