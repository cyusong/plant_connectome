Cluster roots of white lupin are induced by low phosphorus (LP) to efficiently access unavailable P, but how soilborne microbes are associated with cluster root formation (CRF) is unclear. We investigated the roles of soilborne bacteria in CRF response to LP by high-throughput sequencing and root-bacteria interactions. Cluster root number was significantly decreased in plants grown in sterilized soil compared with nonsterilized soil. Proteobacteria was enriched in CR, as shown by microbiome analysis of soil (bulk, rhizosphere, and rhizosheath) and roots (main, lateral, and CR). Large-scale gene expression level implicated ethylene mediation in CRF. Klebsiella pneumoniae (P7), a soilborne bacterium belonging to Proteobacteria, was isolated from CR. Among 11 isolated strains, P7 exhibited the highest 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD) activity; this enzyme inhibits the biosynthesis of ethylene in plants by the cleavage of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and promotes CRF under LP. We constructed an ACCD-deficit mutant accd in the P7 genetic background. The loss-of-function mutation failed to promote CRF under LP conditions. Also, auxin responses may be involved in K. pneumoniae-ethylene-mediated CRF. Overall, we propose that the soilborne bacterium K. pneumoniae promotes CRF of white lupin in response to LP by ethylene mediation.
