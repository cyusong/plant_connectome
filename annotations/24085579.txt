Most genes from the plant-specific family encoding Response to Low Sulphur (LSU)-like proteins are strongly induced in sulphur (S)-deficient conditions. The exact role of these proteins remains unclear; however, some data suggest their importance for plants' adjustment to nutrient deficiency and other environmental stresses. This work established that the regulation of ethylene signalling is a part of plants' response to S deficiency and showed the interaction between UP9C, a tobacco LSU family member, and one of the tobacco isoforms of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACO2A). Increase in ethylene level induced by S deficiency does not take place in tobacco plants with UP9C expressed in an antisense orientation. Based on transcriptomics data, this work also demonstrated that the majority of tobacco's response to S deficiency is misregulated in plants expressing UP9C-antisense. A link between response to S deficiency, ethylene sensing, and LSU-like proteins was emphasized by changes in expression of the genes encoding ethylene receptors and F-box proteins specific for the ethylene pathway.
