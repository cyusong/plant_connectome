The hygromycin phosphotransferase (<i>HPT</i>) gene as a selective marker is normally used in screening tests as a first step in detecting and quantifying genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in seeds, food, and feed materials. Nevertheless, if researchers only focus on the <i>HPT</i> gene, it is difficult to distinguish genetically modified (GM) crops from microbial infection, leading to miscalculation of the rate of GM materials in a given sample set. Here, we cloned the 7259 bp sequence carrying the <i>HPT</i> gene from soybean sprouts using the genome walking strategy. BLAST analysis revealed that this sequence was derived from plasmids naturally occurring in microorganisms, such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> or <i>Salmonella</i> sp. Using the reconstructed plasmid pFP-hpt, qualitative PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methods were established, and 261 bp and 156 bp products were produced. The specificity of these assays was assessed against related pFP-hpt plasmids, plant species with important agronomic traits, and GM crops containing the <i>HPT</i> gene. No unexpected results were observed between samples using these qualitative PCR and qPCR methods. The sensitivity of this qualitative PCR assay was determined at 20 copies, while the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of qPCR were both 5 copies per reaction. Our in-house validation indicated that the amplification efficiency, linearity, and repeatability of this qPCR assay were in line with performance requirements. Furthermore, a qualitative and quantitative duplex PCR showed high reliability for the simultaneous detection of the <i>HPT</i> gene in a plant sample and environmental micro-organisms harboring the <i>HPT</i> gene in one PCR reaction. These qualitative PCR and qPCR assays were able to differentiate between plants infected with <i>E. coli</i> harboring the <i>HPT</i> gene from GM plants, indicating that these two methods are broadly applicable for routine GMO testing.
