The evolutionary pathways leading to the heterostylous syndrome are not well understood, and models concerning the origins of distyly differ in the order in which reciprocal herkogamy and self-incompatibility evolve. We investigated the evolution and breakdown of distyly in Plumbaginaceae, a family with considerable diversity of floral traits and reproductive systems. Using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses and stochastic character mapping, we examined the evolutionary assembly and breakdown of the heterostylous syndrome based on a well-resolved phylogeny of 121 species of Plumbaginaceae and six outgroup taxa using five nuclear and plastid gene regions. We used the distribution of reproductive traits and reconstructed ancestral characters across phylogenies to evaluate competing models for the evolution of distyly. The most likely common ancestor of Plumbaginaceae was self-incompatible and monomorphic for sex-organ arrangement and pollen-stigma characters. Character state reconstructions indicated that reciprocal herkogamy evolved at least three times and that shifts to selfing and apomixis occurred on multiple occasions. Our results provide comparative support for the early ideas of H. G. Baker on evolutionary pathways in Plumbaginaceae, and the more recent selfing avoidance model by D. & B. Charlesworth in which distyly evolves from self-incompatible ancestors.
