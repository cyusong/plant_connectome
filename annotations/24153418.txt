The heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) chaperone system participates in protein folding and quality control of unfolded proteins. To examine the roles of co-chaperones in the rice Hsp70 chaperone system in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the functions of six ER-resident J-proteins (OsP58A, OsP58B, OsERdj2, OsERdj3A, OsERdj3B, and OsERdj7) in rice were investigated. The expression of OsP58B, OsERdj3A, and OsERdj3B was predominantly up-regulated in roots subjected to ER stress. This response was mediated by signalling through ATF6 orthologues such as OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60, but not through the IRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway. A co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that OsP58A, OsP58B, and OsERdj3B preferentially interact with the major OsBiP, OsBiP1, while OsERdj3A interacts preferentially with OsBiP5, suggesting that there are different affinities between OsBiPs and J-proteins. In the endosperm tissue, OsP58A, OsP58B, and OsERdj2 were mainly localized in the ER, whereas OsERdj2 was localized around the outer surfaces of ER-derived protein bodies (PB-Is). Furthermore, OsERdj3A was not expressed in wild-type seeds but was up-regulated in transgenic seeds accumulating human interleukin-7 (hIL-7). Since ERdj3A-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was also detected in vacuoles of callus cells under ER stress conditions, OsERdj3A is a bona fide vacuole-localized protein. OsP58A, OsP58B and OsERdj3A were differentially accumulated in transgenic plants expressing various recombinant proteins. These results reveal the functional diversity of the rice ER-resident Hsp70 system.
