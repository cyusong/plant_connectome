['15918887', 'Fusion of the egg and the sperm cells in plants produces a zygote that develops  into an embryo. Screening of ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized populations of  Arabidopsis led to the identification of EMBRYONIC FACTOR 1 (FAC1), a locus that  gives a zygote-lethal phenotype when mutated. The FAC1 gene was identified by  positional cloning and confirmed by a genetic complementation test against a  T-DNA insertion allele. It encodes an AMP deaminase (AMPD) that is known in human  and yeast to convert AMP to IMP to maintain the energy potential. Expression of  FAC1 in a yeast AMPD mutant after removal of its N-terminal putative  transmembrane domain complemented the mutant phenotype, suggesting a functional  conservancy but a structural divergence through evolution. Although a low level  of FAC1 expression was observed in all organs tested, using a reporter construct  we observed a significantly increased FAC1 expression in the zygote, early embryo  and endosperm. Furthermore, during somatic embryogenesis, a high level of FAC1  expression was observed in developing embryos including putative embryogenic  cells. FAC1, therefore, represents one of the earliest expressed genes known in  plants. It may act through AMP depletion to provide sufficient energy for the  zygote to proceed through development.', '2005 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02411.x', 'Liu']
