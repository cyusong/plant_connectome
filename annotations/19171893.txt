['19171893', 'Control of gene expression depends on a complex and delicate balance of various  posttranslational modifications of histones. However, the relevance of specific  combinations of histone modifications is not fully defined. Downstream effector  proteins recognize particular histone modifications and transduce this  information into gene expression patterns. Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4  (H3K4me) is a landmark of gene expression control in eukaryotes. Its recognition  depends on the presence in the effector protein of a motif termed plant  homeodomain (PHD) that specifically binds to H3K4me3. Here, we establish that  Arabidopsis ORC1, the large subunit of the origin recognition complex involved in  defining origins of DNA replication, functions as a transcriptional activator of  a subset of genes, the promoters of which are preferentially bound by ORC1.  Arabidopsis ORC1 contains a PHD and binds to H3K4me3. In addition to H4  acetylation, ORC1 binding correlates with increased H4K20me3 in the proximal  promoter region of ORC1 targets. This suggests that H4K20me3, unlike in animal  cells, is associated with transcriptional activation in Arabidopsis. Thus, our  data provide a molecular basis for the opposite role of ORC1 in transcriptional  activation in plants and repression in animals. Since only ORC1 proteins of plant  species contain a PHD, we propose that plant ORC1 constitutes a novel class of  H3K4me3 effector proteins characteristic of the plant kingdom.', '2009 Feb 10', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0811093106', 'Gutierrez']
