Soil salinization is one of the major environmental stressors hampering the growth and yield of crops all over the world. A wide spectrum of physiological and biochemical alterations of plants are induced by salinity, which causes lowered water potential in the soil solution, ionic disequilibrium, specific ion effects, and a higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). For many years, numerous investigations have been made into salinity stresses and attempts to minimize the losses of plant productivity, including the effects of phytohormones, osmoprotectants, antioxidants, polyamines, and trace elements. One of the protectants, selenium (Se), has been found to be effective in improving growth and inducing tolerance against excessive soil salinity. However, the in-depth mechanisms of Se-induced salinity tolerance are still unclear. This review refines the knowledge involved in Se-mediated improvements of plant growth when subjected to salinity and suggests future perspectives as well as several research limitations in this field.
