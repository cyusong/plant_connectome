Much of the research on Rubisco aims at increasing crop yields, with the ultimate aim of increasing plant production to feed an increasing global population. However, since the identification of Rubisco as the most abundant protein in leaf material, it has also been touted as a direct source of dietary protein. The nutritional and functional properties of Rubisco are on a par with those of many animal proteins, and are superior to those of many other plant proteins. Purified Rubisco isolates are easily digestible, nutritionally complete, and have excellent foaming, gelling, and emulsifying properties. Despite this potential, challenges in efficiently extracting and separating Rubisco have limited its use as a global foodstuff. Leaves are lower in protein than seeds, requiring large amounts of biomass to be processed. This material normally needs to be processed quickly to avoid degradation of the final product. Extraction of Rubisco from the plant material requires breaking down the cell walls and rupturing the chloroplast. In order to obtain high-quality protein, Rubisco needs to be separated from chlorophyll, and then concentrated for final use. However, with increased consumer demand for plant protein, there is increased interest in the potential of leaf protein, and many commercial plants are now being established aimed at producing Rubisco as a food protein, with over US$60 million of funding invested in the past 5 years. Is now the time for increased use of Rubisco in food production as a nitrogen source, rather than just providing a carbon source?
