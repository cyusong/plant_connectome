Leaf metabolism produces H2O2 at high rates, but current concepts suggest that the potent signalling effects of this oxidant require that concentrations be controlled by a battery of antioxidative enzymes. The extent to which H2O2 is allowed to accumulate remains unclear. There is little consensus on leaf H2O2 values in the literature and measured concentrations in unstressed conditions range from 50-5000 nmol g(-1) fresh weight, a difference that probably reflects technical inaccuracies as much as biological variability. This article uses new experimental and literature data to examine some of the difficulties in accurately measuring H2O2 in leaf extracts. Potential problems relate to sensitivity, interference from other redox-active compounds, and H2O2 stability during sample preparation. Particular attention is drawn to the influence of tissue mass/extraction volume in the quantitative estimation of H2O2 contents, and the possibility that this factor could contribute to the variability of literature data.
