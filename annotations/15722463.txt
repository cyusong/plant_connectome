The mechanisms for the regulation of homeotic genes are poorly understood in most organisms, including plants. We identified BASIC PENTACYSTEINE1 (BPC1) as a regulator of the homeotic Arabidopsis thaliana gene SEEDSTICK (STK), which controls ovule identity, and characterized its mechanism of action. A combination of tethered particle motion analysis and electromobility shift assays revealed that BPC1 is able to induce conformational changes by cooperative binding to purine-rich elements present in the STK regulatory sequence. Analysis of STK expression in the bpc1 mutant showed that STK is upregulated. Our results give insight into the regulation of gene expression in plants and provide the basis for further studies to understand the mechanisms that control ovule identity in Arabidopsis.
