Expression of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) homologous to virus sequences can effectively interfere with RNA virus infection in plant cells by triggering RNA silencing. Here we applied this approach against a DNA virus, African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV), in its natural host cassava. Transgenic cassava plants were developed to express small interfering RNAs (siRNA) from a CaMV 35S promoter-controlled, intron-containing dsRNA cognate to the common region-containing bidirectional promoter of ACMV DNA-A. In two of three independent transgenic lines, accelerated plant recovery from ACMV-NOg infection was observed, which correlates with the presence of transgene-derived siRNAs 21-24 nt in length. Overall, cassava mosaic disease symptoms were dramatically attenuated in these two lines and less viral DNA accumulation was detected in their leaves than in those of wild-type plants. In a transient replication assay using leaf disks from the two transgenic lines, strongly reduced accumulation of viral single-stranded DNA was observed. Our study suggests that a natural RNA silencing mechanism targeting DNA viruses through production of virus-derived siRNAs is turned on earlier and more efficiently in transgenic plants expressing dsRNA cognate to the viral promoter and common region.
