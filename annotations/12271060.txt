['12271060', 'Increases in the terrestrial levels of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (280 to 320  nm) due to diminished stratospheric ozone have prompted an investigation of the  protective mechanisms that contribute to UV-B tolerance in plants. In response to  UV-B stress, flowering plants produce a variety of UV-absorptive secondary  products derived from phenylalanine. Arabidopsis mutants with defects in the  synthesis of these compounds were tested for UV-B sensitivity. The transparent  testa-4 (tt4) mutant, which has reduced flavonoids and normal levels of sinapate  esters, is more sensitive to UV-B than the wild type when grown under high UV-B  irradiance. The tt5 and tt6 mutants, which have reduced levels of UV-absorptive  leaf flavonoids and the monocyclic sinapic acid ester phenolic compounds, are  highly sensitive to the damaging effects of UV-B radiation. These results  demonstrate that both flavonoids and other phenolic compounds play important  roles in vivo in plant UV-B protection.', '1993 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.5.2.171', 'Last']
