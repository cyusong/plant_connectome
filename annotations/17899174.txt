Chloroplastic LOXs are implicated in the biosynthesis of oxylipins like jasmonic acid and C6 volatiles among others. In this study, we isolated the cDNA of a novel chloroplast-targeted Phaseolus vulgaris LOX, (PvLOX6). This gene is highly induced after wounding, non-host pathogen infection, and by signaling molecules as H2O2, SA, ethylene and MeJA. The phylogenetic analysis of PvLOX6 showed that it is closely related to chloroplast-targeted LOX from potato (H1) and tomato (TomLOXC); both of them are implicated in the biosynthesis of C6 volatiles. Induction of PvLOX6 mRNA by wounding ethylene and jasmonic acid on the one side, and non-host pathogen, salicylic acid on the other indicates that common bean uses the same LOX to synthesize oxylipins in response to different stresses.
