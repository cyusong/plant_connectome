Plant cell surface receptor-like kinases (RLKs) mediate the signals from microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) that induce immune responses. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major constituent of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, is a common MAMP perceived by animals and plants; however, the plant receptors/co-receptors are unknown except for LORE, a bulb-type lectin S-domain RLK (B-lectin SD1-RLK) in Arabidopsis. OsCERK1 is a multifunctional RLK in rice that contains lysin motifs (LysMs) and is essential for the perception of chitin, a fungal MAMP, and peptidoglycan, a bacterial MAMP. Here, we analyzed the relevance of OsCERK1 to LPS perception in rice. Using OsCERK1-knockout mutants (oscerk1), we evaluated hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) production and gene expression after LPS treatment. We also examined the LPS response in knockout mutants for the B-lectin SD1-RLK genes in rice and for all LysM-protein genes in Arabidopsis. Compared with wild-type rice cells, LPS responses in oscerk1 cells were mostly diminished. By contrast, rice lines mutated in either of three B-lectin SD1-RLK genes and Arabidopsis lines mutated in the LysM-protein genes responded normally to LPS. From these results, we conclude that OsCERK1 is an LPS receptor/co-receptor and that the LPS perception systems of rice and Arabidopsis are significantly different.
