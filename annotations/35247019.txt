Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is a key signaling molecule that activates jasmonate-regulated flower development and the wound stress response. For years, JASMONATE RESISTANT1 (JAR1) has been the sole jasmonoyl-amino acid synthetase known to conjugate jasmonic acid (JA) to isoleucine, and the source of persisting JA-Ile in jar1 knockout mutants has remained elusive until now. Here we demonstrate through recombinant enzyme assays and loss-of-function mutant analyses that AtGH3.10 functions as a JA-amido synthetase. Recombinant AtGH3.10 could conjugate JA to isoleucine, alanine, leucine, methionine, and valine. The JA-Ile accumulation in the gh3.10-2 jar1-11 double mutant was nearly eliminated in the leaves and flower buds while its catabolism derivative 12OH-JA-Ile was undetected in the flower buds and unwounded leaves. Residual levels of JA-Ile, JA-Ala, and JA-Val were nonetheless detected in gh3.10-2 jar1-11, suggesting the activities of similar promiscuous enzymes. Upon wounding, the accumulation of JA-Ile and 12OH-JA-Ile and the expression of JA-responsive genes OXOPHYTODIENOIC ACID REDUCTASE3 and JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN1 observed in WT, gh3.10-1, and jar1-11 leaves were effectively abolished in gh3.10-2 jar1-11. Additionally, an increased proportion of undeveloped siliques associated with retarded stamen development was observed in gh3.10-2 jar1-11. These findings conclusively show that AtGH3.10 contributes to JA-amino acid biosynthesis and functions partially redundantly with AtJAR1 in sustaining flower development and the wound stress response in Arabidopsis.
