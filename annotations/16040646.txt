Virus-induced cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (referred to as virus replication complexes [VRCs]) consisting of virus and host components are observed in plant cells infected with tobacco mosaic virus, but the components that modulate their form and function are not fully understood. Here, we show that the tobacco mosaic virus 126-kD protein fused with green fluorescent protein formed cytoplasmic bodies (126-bodies) in the absence of other viral components. Using mutant 126-kD:green fluorescent fusion proteins and viral constructs expressing the corresponding mutant 126-kD proteins, it was determined that the size of the 126-bodies and the corresponding VRCs changed in synchrony for each 126-kD protein mutation tested. Through colabeling experiments, we observed the coalignment and intracellular trafficking of 126-bodies and, regardless of size, VRCs, along microfilaments (MFs). Disruption of MFs with MF-depolymerizing agents or through virus-induced gene silencing compromised the intracellular trafficking of the 126-bodies and VRCs and virus cell-to-cell movement, but did not decrease virus accumulation to levels that would affect virus movement or prevent VRC formation. Our results indicate that (1) the 126-kD protein modulates VRC size and traffics along MFs in cells; (2) VRCs traffic along MFs in cells, possibly through an interaction with the 126-kD protein, and the negative effect of MF antagonists on 126-body and VRC intracellular movement and virus cell-to-cell movement correlates with the disruption of this association; and (3) virus movement was not correlated with VRC size.
