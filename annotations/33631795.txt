['33631795', 'Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) is an endogenous storage auxin important for  maintaining appropriate indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels, thereby  influencingprimary root elongation and lateral root development. IBA is  metabolized into free IAA in peroxisomes in a multistep process similar to fatty  acid beta-oxidation. We identified LONG CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE 4 (LACS4) in a  screen for enhanced IBA resistance in primary root elongation in Arabidopsis  thaliana. LACSs activate substrates by catalyzing the addition of CoA, the  necessary first step for fatty acids to participate in beta-oxidation or other  metabolic pathways. Here, we describe the novel role of LACS4 in hormone  metabolism and postulate that LACS4 catalyzes the addition of CoA onto IBA, the  first step in its beta-oxidation. lacs4 is resistant to the effects of IBA in  primary root elongation and dark-grown hypocotyl elongation, and has reduced  lateral root density. lacs6 also is resistant to IBA, although both lacs4 and  lacs6 remain sensitive to IAA in primary root elongation, demonstrating that  auxin responses are intact. LACS4 has in vitro enzymatic activity on IBA, but not  IAA or IAA conjugates, and disruption of LACS4 activity reduces the amount of  IBA-derived IAA in planta. We conclude that, in addition to activity on fatty  acids, LACS4 and LACS6 also catalyze the addition of CoA onto IBA, the first step  in IBA metabolism and a necessary step in generating IBA-derived IAA.', '2021 Feb 25', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiaa002', 'Zolman']
