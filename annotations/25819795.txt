['25819795', 'Alternative splicing is prevalent in plants, but little is known about its  regulation in the context of developmental and signaling pathways. We describe  here a new factor that influences pre-messengerRNA (mRNA) splicing and is  essential for embryonic development in Arabidopsis thaliana. This factor was  retrieved in a genetic screen that identified mutants impaired in expression of  an alternatively spliced GFP reporter gene. In addition to the known spliceosomal  component PRP8, the screen recovered Arabidopsis RTF2 (AtRTF2), a previously  uncharacterized, evolutionarily conserved protein containing a replication  termination factor 2 (Rtf2) domain. A homozygous null mutation in AtRTF2 is  embryo lethal, indicating that AtRTF2 is an essential protein. Quantitative  RT-PCR demonstrated that impaired expression of GFP in atrtf2 and prp8 mutants is  due to inefficient splicing of the GFP pre-mRNA. A genome-wide analysis using RNA  sequencing indicated that 13-16% of total introns are retained to a significant  degree in atrtf2 mutants. Considering these results and previous suggestions that  Rtf2 represents an ubiquitin-related domain, we discuss the possible role of  AtRTF2 in ubiquitin-based regulation of pre-mRNA splicing.', '2015 Jun', 'Genetics', '10.1534/genetics.115.176438', 'Matzke']
