['19093971', 'Magnesium (Mg(2+)) is one of the essential cations in all cells. Although the  Mg(2+) transport mechanism has been well-documented in bacteria, less is known  about Mg(2+) transporters in eukaryotes. The AtMGT gene family encoding putative  magnesium transport proteins had been described previously. We report here that  one of the Arabidopsis MGT family members, the AtMGT7 gene, encodes two mRNAs  that have resulted from alternative splicing variants, designated AtMGT7a and  AtMGT7b. Interestingly, the two mRNA variants were expressed with different  patterns with AtMGT7a expressing in all organs, but AtMGT7b appearing only in  root and flowers. The AtMGT7a variant functionally complemented a bacterial  mutant lacking Mg(2+) transport capacity, whereas AtMGT7b did not. The (63)Ni(2+)  tracer uptake analysis in the bacterial model showed that AtMGT7a mediated  low-affinity transport of Mg(2+). Consistent with the complementation assay  result, (63)Ni(2+) tracer uptake analysis revealed that AtMGT7b did not transport  Mg(2+). This study therefore has identified from a higher plant the first  low-affinity Mg(2+) transporter encoded by a gene with alternatively spliced  transcripts that produce proteins with distinct functions.', '2008 Dec', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/j.1744-7909.2008.00770.x', 'Luan']
