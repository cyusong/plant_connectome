Flowering time variation in soybean is well characterized within domesticated germplasms and is critical for modern production, but its importance during domestication is unclear. Recently, Lu et al. (Nature Genetics, 2020) reported that two homeologous pseudo-response-regulator genes, Tof12 and Tof11, were sequentially selected in early soybean evolution for ancient flowering time adaptation and intensification of crop cultivation.
