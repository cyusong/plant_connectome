Bacterial attachment on root surfaces is an important step preceding the colonization or internalization and subsequent infection of plants by pathogens. Unfortunately, bacterial attachment is not well understood because the phenomenon is difficult to observe. Here we assessed whether this limitation could be overcome using optical trapping approaches. We have developed a system based on counter-propagating beams and studied its ability to guide Pectobacterium atrosepticum (Pba) cells to different root cell types within the interstices of transparent soils. Bacterial cells were successfully trapped and guided to root hair cells, epidermal cells, border cells, and tissues damaged by laser ablation. Finally, we used the system to quantify the bacterial cell detachment rate of Pba cells on root surfaces following reversible attachment. Optical trapping techniques could greatly enhance our ability to deterministically characterize mechanisms linked to attachment and formation of biofilms in the rhizosphere.
