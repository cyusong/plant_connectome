['22974522', 'Replication factor C1 (RFC1), which is conserved in eukaryotes, is involved in  DNA replication and checkpoint control. However, a RFC1 product participating in  DNA repair at meiosis has not been reported in Arabidopsis. Here, we report  functional characterization of AtRFC1 through analysis of the rfc1-2 mutant. The  rfc1-2 mutant displayed normal vegetative growth but showed silique sterility  because the male gametophyte was arrested at the uninucleus microspore stage and  the female at the functional megaspore stage. Expression of AtRFC1 was  concentrated in the reproductive organ primordia, meiocytes and developing  gametes. Chromosome spreads showed that pairing and synapsis were normal, and the  chromosomes were broken when desynapsis began at late prophase I, and chromosome  fragments remained in the subsequent stages. For this reason, homologous  chromosomes and sister chromatids segregated unequally, leading to pollen  sterility. Immunolocalization revealed that the AtRFC1 protein localized to the  chromosomes during zygotene and pachytene in wild-type but were absent in the  spo11-1 mutant. The chromosome fragmentation of rfc1-2 was suppressed by spo11-1,  indicating that AtRFC1 acted downstream of AtSPO11-1. The similar chromosome  behavior of rad51 rfc1-2 and rad51 suggests that AtRFC1 may act with AtRAD51 in  the same pathway. In summary, AtRFC1 is required for DNA double-strand break  repair during meiotic homologous recombination of Arabidopsis.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12024', 'Zhao']
