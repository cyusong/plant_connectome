Plants may suffer from ammonium (NH4+) toxicity when NH4+ is the sole nitrogen source. Nitrate (NO3-) is known to alleviate NH4+ toxicity, but the mechanisms are unknown. This study has evaluated possible mechanisms of NO3- alleviation of NH4+ toxicity in canola (Brassica napus L.). Dynamics of net fluxes of NH4+, H+, K+ and Ca2+ were assessed, using a non-invasive microelectrode (MIFE) technique, in plants having different NO3- supplies, after single or several subsequent increases in external NH4Cl concentration. After an increase in external NH4Cl without NO3-, NH4+ net fluxes demonstrated three distinct stages: release (tau1), return to uptake (tau2), and a decrease in uptake rate (tau3). The presence of NO3- in the bathing medium prevented the tau1 release and also resulted in slower activation of the tau3 stage. Net fluxes of Ca2+ were in the opposite direction to NH4+ net fluxes, regardless of NO3- supply. In contrast, H+ and K+ net fluxes and change in external pH were not correlated with NH4+ net fluxes. It is concluded that (i) NO3- primarily affects the NH4+ low-affinity influx system; and (ii) NH4+ transport is inversely linked to Ca2+ net flux.
