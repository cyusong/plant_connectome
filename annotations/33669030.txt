Potato tuber dormancy is critical for the post-harvest quality. Snakin/Gibberellic Acid Stimulated in Arabidopsis (GASA) family genes are involved in the plants' defense against pathogens and in growth and development, but the effect of Snakin-2 (SN2) on tuber dormancy and sprouting is largely unknown. In this study, a transgenic approach was applied to manipulate the expression level of <i>SN2</i> in tubers, and it demonstrated that <i>St</i>SN2 significantly controlled tuber sprouting, and silencing <i>StSN2</i> resulted in a release of dormancy and overexpressing tubers showed a longer dormant period than that of the control. Further analyses revealed that the decrease expression level accelerated skin cracking and water loss. Metabolite analyses revealed that <i>St</i>SN2 significantly down-regulated the accumulation of lignin precursors in the periderm, and the change of lignin content was documented, a finding which was consistent with the precursors' level. Subsequently, proteomics found that cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and peroxidase (Prx), the key proteins for lignin synthesis, were significantly up-regulated in silencing lines, and gene expression and enzyme activity analyses also supported this effect. Interestingly, we found that <i>St</i>SN2 physically interacts with three peroxidases catalyzing the oxidation and polymerization of lignin. In addition, SN2 altered the hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) content and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). These results suggest that <i>St</i>SN2 negatively regulates lignin biosynthesis and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, and ultimately inhibits the sprouting of potato tubers.
