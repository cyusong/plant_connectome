['20214900', "The 77 kDa subunit of the polyadenylation cleavage stimulation factor (CstF77) is  important in messenger RNA 3' end processing. Previously, we demonstrated that  AtCstF77 interacts with AtCPSF30, the Arabidopsis ortholog of the 30 kDa subunit  of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor. In further dissecting  this interaction, it was found that the C-terminus of AtCstF77 interacts with  AtCPSF30. Remarkably, we also found that the C-terminal domain of AtCstF77  possesses RNA-binding ability. These studies therefore reveal AtCstF77 to be an  RNA-binding protein, adding yet another RNA-binding activity to the plant  polyadenylation complex. This raises interesting questions as to the means by  which RNAs are recognized during mRNA 3' end formation in plants.", '2010 Apr 16', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2010.03.007', 'Hunt']
