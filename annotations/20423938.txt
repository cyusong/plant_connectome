['20423938', 'Stomatal closure during water stress is a major plant mechanism for reducing the  loss of water through leaves. The opening and closure of stomata are mediated by  endomembrane trafficking. The role of the vacuolar trafficking pathway, that  involves v-SNAREs of the AtVAMP71 family (formerly called AtVAMP7C) in stomatal  movements, was analysed. Expression of AtVAMP711-14 genes was manipulated in  Arabidopsis plants with sense or antisense constructs by transformation of the  AtVAMP711 gene. Antisense plants exhibited decreased stomatal closure during  drought or after treatment with abscisic acid (ABA), resulting in the rapid loss  of leaf water and tissue collapse. No improvement was seen in plants  overexpressing the AtVAMP711 gene, suggesting that wild-type levels of AtVAMP711  expression are sufficient. ABA treatment induced the production of reactive  oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells of both wild-type and antisense plants,  indicating that correct hormone sensing is maintained. ROS were detected in  nuclei, chloroplasts, and vacuoles. ABA treatment caused a significant increase  in ROS-containing small vacuoles and also in plastids and nuclei of neighbouring  epidermal and mesophyll cells. Taken together, our results show that VAMP71  proteins play an important role in the localization of ROS, and in the regulation  of stomatal closure by ABA treatment. The paper also describes a novel aspect of  ROS signalling in plants: that of ROS production in small vacuoles that are  dispersed in the cytoplasm.', '2010 Jun', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erq099', 'Levine']
