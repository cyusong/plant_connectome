We used instantaneous temperature responses of CO<sub>2</sub> -respiration to explore temperature acclimation dynamics for Eucalyptus grandis grown with differing nitrogen supply. A reduction in ambient temperature from 23 to 19 °C reduced light-saturated photosynthesis by 25% but increased respiratory capacity by 30%. Changes in respiratory capacity were not reversed after temperatures were subsequently increased to 27 °C. Temperature sensitivity of respiration measured at prevalent ambient temperature varied little between temperature treatments but was significantly reduced from ~105 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> when supply of N was weak, to ~70 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> when it was strong. Temperature sensitivity of respiration measured across a broader temperature range (20-40 °C) could be fully described by 2 exponent parameters of an Arrhenius-type model (i.e., activation energy of respiration at low reference temperature and a parameter describing the temperature dependence of activation energy). These 2 parameters were strongly correlated, statistically explaining 74% of observed variation. Residual variation was linked to treatment-induced changes in respiration at low reference temperature or respiratory capacity. Leaf contents of starch and soluble sugars suggest that respiratory capacity varies with source-sink imbalances in carbohydrate utilization, which in combination with shifts in carbon-flux mode, serve to maintain homeostasis of respiratory temperature sensitivity at prevalent growth temperature.
