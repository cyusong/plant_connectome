Both tracheary elements and fiber cells undergo programmed cell death (PCD) during xylem development. In this study we investigated the role of papain-like cysteine protease CEP1 in PCD in the xylem of Arabidopsis. CEP1 was located in the cell wall of xylem cells, and CEP1 expression levels in inflorescence stems increased during stem maturation. cep1 mutant plants exhibited delayed stem growth and reduced xylem cell number compared to wild-type plants. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that organelle degradation was delayed during PCD, and thicker secondary walls were present in fiber cells and tracheary elements of the cep1 mutant. Transcriptional analyses of the maturation stage of the inflorescence stem revealed that genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary wall components, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, as well as wood-associated transcriptional factors, were up-regulated in the cep1 mutant. These results suggest that CEP1 is directly involved in the clearing of cellular content during PCD and regulates secondary wall thickening during xylem development.
