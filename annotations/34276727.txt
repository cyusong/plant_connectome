Mixed stands can be more productive if growth facilitation via niche segregation occurs. <i>Dalbergia odorifera</i> T. Chen, a tropical tree species endemic to Hainan Island with great economic values, belongs to the family Leguminosae. However, selecting mixed species with suitable ecological niches to efficiently construct mixed forests of <i>D. odorifera</i> in the context of abiotic stress [drought, nitrogen (N) deposition] remained obscure. In the present study, the target plant <i>D. odorifera</i> was planted with the same species <i>D. odorifera</i>, heterogeneous but the same family <i>Delonix regia</i> and non-Leguminous Family <i>Swietenia mahagoni</i> in the root interaction and isolated models under two watering regimes [100% and 30% field capacity (FC)] and two N applications (application, non-application), respectively. Principle component analysis based on the performances of growth, phenotype, and physiology was performed to identify the main factors affected by the treatments and the most discriminatory effects of water, N level, and species interaction models. Both comprehensive evaluation values and comprehensive index values were calculated to evaluate the influences of different niche neighbors on <i>D. odorifera</i>. Results showed that <i>D. odorifera</i> was benefited from <i>S. mahagoni</i> but inhibited from <i>D. odorifera</i> in all treatments under root system interaction. Drought stress aggravated the inhibitory effects on <i>D. odorifera</i> from <i>D. odorifera</i>. N application stimulated the promoted effects on <i>D. odorifera</i> from <i>S. mahagoni</i> but enhanced competition intensity of <i>D. odorifera</i> from <i>D. regia</i> under the 100% FC condition. N application alleviated the inhibitory effect of drought stress on <i>D. odorifera</i> from <i>D. odorifera</i> and <i>S. mahagoni</i>. Furthermore, the responses of <i>D. odorifera</i> to different niche neighbors were dominated by belowground interaction rather than the negligible aboveground one. Therefore, the feasibility of niche segregation as the criterion for selecting neighbors to construct <i>D. odorifera</i> mixed stands was confirmed. In addition, water level and N application could alter responses of <i>D. odorifera</i> to different niche neighbors under the root system interaction. Appropriate N application could alleviate the inhibitory effect of drought stress on <i>D. odorifera</i> in its mixed forests. A mixture with <i>S</i>. <i>mahagoni</i> under appropriate N application could be the optimal planting model.
