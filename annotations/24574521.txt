Recent studies have demonstrated that chloroplasts and mitochondria evoke specific Ca(2+) signals in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in a stress-dependent manner. The identification of Ca(2+) transporters and Ca(2+) signaling molecules in chloroplasts and mitochondria implies that they play roles in controlling not only intra-organellar functions, but also extra-organellar processes such as plant immunity and stress responses. It appears that organellar Ca(2+) signaling might be more important to plant cell functions than previously thought. This review briefly summarizes what is known about the molecular basis of Ca(2+) signaling in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts.

Chloroplasts: !evoke! Ca(2+) signals
Mitochondria: !evoke! Ca(2+) signals
Ca(2+) transporters: !localize to! Chloroplasts/Mitochondria
Ca(2+) signaling molecules: !localize to! Chloroplasts/Mitochondria
Organellar Ca(2+) signaling: !controls! Intra-organellar/Extra-organellar processes
