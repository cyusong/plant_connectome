In flowering plants, anthers bear male gametophytes whose development is regulated by the elaborate coordination of many genes. In addition, both gibberellic acid (GA3) and jasmonic acid (JA) play important roles in anther development and pollen fertility. To facilitate the analysis of anther development genes and how GA3 and JA regulate anther development, we performed microarray experiments using a 10-K cDNA microarray with probes derived from seedlings, meiotic anthers, mature anthers and GA3- or JA-treated suspension cells of rice. The expression level change of 2155 genes was significantly (by 2-fold or greater) detected in anthers compared with seedlings. Forty-seven genes, representing genes with potential function in cell cycle and cell structure regulation, hormone response, photosynthesis, stress resistance and metabolism, were differentially expressed in meiotic and mature anthers. Moreover, 314 genes responded to either GA3 or JA treatment, and 24 GA3- and 82 JA-responsive genes showed significant changes in expression between meiosis and the mature anther stages. RT-PCR demonstrated that gene y656d05 was not only highly expressed in meiotic anthers but also induced by GA3. Strong RNA signals of y656d05 were detected in pollen mother cells and tapetum in in situ hybridization. Further characterization of these candidate genes can contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of anther development and the involvement of JA and GA3 signals in the control of anther development in rice.
