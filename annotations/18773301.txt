['18773301', 'In Arabidopsis thaliana, acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) are encoded by six  genes, and they display varying affinities for acyl-CoA esters. Recombinant ACBP4  and ACBP5 have been shown to bind oleoyl-CoA esters in vitro. In this study, the  subcellular localizations of ACBP4 and ACBP5 were determined by biochemical  fractionation followed by western blot analyses using anti-ACBP4 and anti-ACBP5  antibodies and immuno-electron microscopy. Confocal microscopy of  autofluorescence-tagged ACBP4 and ACBP5, expressed transiently in onion epidermal  cells and in transgenic Arabidopsis, confirmed their expression in the cytosol.  Taken together, ACBP4 and ACBP5 are available in the cytosol to bind and transfer  cytosolic oleoyl-CoA esters. Lipid profile analysis further revealed that an  acbp4 knockout mutant showed decreases in membrane lipids  (digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine,  phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol) while acbp4-complemented lines  attained levels similar to wild type, suggesting that ACBP4 plays a role in the  biosynthesis of membrane lipids including galactolipids and phospholipids.', '2008 Dec', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-008-9392-7', 'Chye']
