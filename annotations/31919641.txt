Leaf senescence, which affects plant growth and yield in rice, is an ideal target for crop improvement and remarkable advances have been made to identify the mechanism underlying this process. We have characterized an early senile mutant es5 (early leaf senescence 5) in rice exhibiting leaf yellowing phenotype after the 4-leaf stage. This phenotype was confirmed by the higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), the disintegration of chloroplasts, reduction in chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate and up-regulation of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) like Osh36, OsI57, and OsI85. Positional cloning revealed that the es5 phenotype is the result of one base substitution in ES5, encoding phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS) family protein, which is involved in the base-exchange type reaction to synthesize the minor membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine. Functional complementation of ES5 in the es5 plants completely restored the wild-type phenotype. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analysis showed that es5 plants had increased levels of phosphatidylserine (PS) and decreased level of phosphatidylcholine (PC). These results provide evidence about the role of PS in rice leaf senescence.
