C(4)-type photosynthesis is known to vary with growth and measurement temperatures. In an attempt to quantify its variability with measurement temperature, the photosynthetic parameters - the maximum catalytic rate of the enzyme ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (V(cmax)), the maximum catalytic rate of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) (V(pmax)) and the maximum electron transport rate (J(max)) - were examined. Maize plants were grown in climatic-controlled phytotrons, and the curves of net photosynthesis (A(n)) versus intercellular air space CO(2) concentrations (C(i)), and A(n) versus photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) were determined over a temperature range of 15-40 degrees C. Values of V(cmax), V(pmax) and J(max) were computed by inversion of the von Caemmerer & Furbank photosynthesis model. Values of V(pmax) and J(max) obtained at 25 degrees C conform to values found in the literature. Parameters for an Arrhenius equation that best fits the calculated values of V(cmax), V(pmax) and J(max) are then proposed. These parameters should be further tested with C(4) plants for validation. Other model key parameters such as the mesophyll cell conductance to CO(2) (g(i)), the bundle sheath cells conductance to CO(2) (g(bs)) and Michaelis-Menten constants for CO(2) and O(2) (K(c), K(p) and K(o)) also vary with temperature and should be better parameterized.
