Nitrogen deficient and drought-tolerant or sensitive potatoes differ in proteomic responses under combined (NWD) and individual stresses. The sensitive genotype 'Kiebitz' exhibits a higher abundance of proteases under NWD. Abiotic stresses such as N deficiency and drought affect the yield of Solanum tuberosum L. tremendously. Therefore, it is of importance to improve potato genotypes in terms of stress tolerance. In this study, we identified differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in four starch potato genotypes under N deficiency (ND), drought stress (WD), or combined stress (NWD) in two rain-out shelter experiments. The gel-free LC-MS analysis generated a set of 1177 identified and quantified proteins. The incidence of common DAPs in tolerant and sensitive genotypes under NWD indicates general responses to this stress combination. Most of these proteins were part of the amino acid metabolism (13.9%). Three isoforms of S-adenosyl methionine synthase (SAMS) were found to be lower abundant in all genotypes. As SAMS were found upon application of single stresses as well, these proteins appear to be part of the general stress response in potato. Interestingly, the sensitive genotype 'Kiebitz' showed a higher abundance of three proteases (subtilase, carboxypeptidase, subtilase family protein) and a lower abundance of a protease inhibitor (stigma expressed protein) under NWD stress compared to control plants. The comparably tolerant genotype 'Tomba', however, displayed lower abundances of proteases. This indicates a better coping strategy for the tolerant genotype and a quicker reaction to WD when previously stressed with ND.
