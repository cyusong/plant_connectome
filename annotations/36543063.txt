This study focuses on class III peroxidases (POD) (EC 1.11.1.7) as regulators of cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in leaves under oxidative stress. The effective regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations in plant tissues is crucial for plant survival, and has been extensively reviewed. However, the majority of studies regard POD as a generalist without substrate specificity. This is partly due to the fact that laboratory protocols assessing POD levels use substrates, which are not contained in plants. Here, we show that both base- and stress-inducible POD activity depends on the choice of substrate. Moreover, the application of diverse substrates, particularly those contained in plants, unmasks POD isoenzymes that are distinguished by substrate preferences. This functional heterogeneity of POD responses is worth studying, especially in parallel with stress-induced changes in the phenolic profiles.
