Magnesium ion is one of the essential mineral elements for plant growth and development, which participates in a variety of physiological and biochemical processes. Since there is no report on the research of magnesium ion transporter in grape, the study of the structure and function of magnesium ion transporters (MGT) is helpful to understand the dynamic balance mechanism of intracellular magnesium ions and their inter- or intra-cellular activities. In this study, we identified the members of MGT protein family in grape and performed the phylogenetic and expression analysis. We have identified nine VvMGT genes in grape genome, which are distributed on eight different chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MGT family members of grapes were divided into five subfamilies and had obvious homology with Arabidopsis, maize, and pear. Based on transcriptome data from the web databases, we analyzed the expression patterns of VvMGTs at different development stages and in response to abiotic stresses including waterlogging, drought, salinity, and copper. Using qRT-PCR method, we tested the expression of grape VvMGTs under magnesium and aluminum treatments and found significant changes in VvMGTs expression. In addition, four of the MGT proteins in grape were located in the nucleus. Overall, in this study we investigated the structural characteristics, evolution pattern, and expression analysis of VvMGTs in depth, which laid the foundation for further revealing the function of VvMGT genes in grape.
