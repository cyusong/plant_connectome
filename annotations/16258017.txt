Jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), collectively known as JAs, regulate diverse physiological processes in plants, including the response to wounding. Recent reports suggest that a cyclopentenone precursor of JA, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), can also induce gene expression. However, little is known about the physiological significance of OPDA-dependent gene expression. We used microarray analysis of approximately 21,500 Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes to compare responses to JA, MeJA, and OPDA treatment. Although many genes responded identically to both OPDA and JAs, we identified a set of genes (OPDA-specific response genes [ORGs]) that specifically responded to OPDA but not to JAs. ORGs primarily encoded signaling components, transcription factors, and stress response-related genes. One-half of the ORGs were induced by wounding. Analysis using mutants deficient in the biosynthesis of JAs revealed that OPDA functions as a signaling molecule in the wounding response. Unlike signaling via JAs, OPDA signaling was CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 independent. These results indicate that an OPDA signaling pathway functions independently of JA/MeJA signaling and is required for the wounding response in Arabidopsis.
