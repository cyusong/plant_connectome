Rice blast, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is one of the most devastating diseases in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Plant annexins are calcium- and lipid-binding proteins that have multiple functions; however, the biological roles of annexins in plant disease resistance remain unknown. Here, we report a rice annexin gene, OsANN1 (Rice annexin 1), that was induced by M. oryzae infection and negatively regulated blast disease resistance in rice. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that OsANN1 interacted with a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, HAN1 ("HAN" termed "chilling" in Chinese), which has been reported to catalyze the conversion of biologically active jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) to the inactive form 12-hydroxy-JA-Ile (12OH-JA-Ile). Pathogen inoculation assays revealed that HAN1 was also a negative regulator in rice blast resistance. Genetic evidence showed that OsANN1 acts upstream of HAN1. OsANN1 stabilizes HAN1 in planta, resulting in the inactivation of the endogenous biologically active JA-Ile. Taken together, our study unravels a mechanism where an OsANN1-HAN1 module impairs blast disease resistance via inactivating biologically active JA-Ile and JA signaling in rice.
