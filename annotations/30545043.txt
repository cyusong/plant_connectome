The homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) is a plant-specific transcription factor family that plays important roles in plant developmental processes in response to multiple stressors. We previously isolated a cotton HD-ZIP class I transcription factor gene, <i>GhHB12</i>, which is regulated by the circadian clock and photoperiodism. Furthermore, it regulates cotton architecture, phase transition, and photoperiod sensitivity. Here we report that <i>GhHB12</i> was induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> infection. Additionally, stress-responsive elements were found in the <i>GhHB12</i> promoter. Promoter fusion analysis showed that <i>GhHB12</i> was predominantly expressed in primary roots and that it was induced by mechanical damage. Overexpression of <i>GhHB12</i> increased susceptibility of the cotton plant to the fungal pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>V. dahliae</i>, which was coupled with suppression of the jasmonic acid (JA)-response genes <i>GhJAZ2</i> and <i>GhPR3</i>. Our results suggest that GhHB12, a cotton stress-responsive HD-ZIP I transcription factor, negatively regulates cotton resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> by suppressing JA-response genes.
