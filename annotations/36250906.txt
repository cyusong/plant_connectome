Fruit ripening is a complicated process that is accompanied by the formation of fruit quality. It is not only regulated at the transcriptional level via transcription factors or DNA methylation but also fine-tuned after transcription occurs. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of key regulatory mechanisms of fleshy fruit ripening after transcription. We mainly highlight the typical mechanisms by which fruit ripening is controlled, namely, alternative splicing, mRNA m6A methylation, and non-coding RNAs at the post-transcriptional level; regulation of translation efficiency and uORF-mediated translational repression at the translational level; and histone modifications, protein phosphorylation, and protein ubiquitination at the post-translational level. Taken together, these post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, along with transcriptional regulation, constitute the molecular framework of fruit ripening. We also critically discuss the potential usage of some mechanisms to improve fruit traits.
