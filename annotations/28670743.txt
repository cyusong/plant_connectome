Root structures secreting carboxylates and phosphatases are thought to enhance a plant's phosphorus (P) acquisition. But do closely related species with and without such structures really differ in root exudation, P mobilization, or ecological niche? We investigated this by comparing 23 European Carex species with and without 'dauciform roots' (DRs). Plants grown in pots with sand were screened for DR formation, phosphatase activities, carboxylate exudation, and utilization of various organic and inorganic P compounds. Ecological niches were compared using ecological indicator values and nutrient concentrations of plant shoots in natural habitats. Species of subgenus Carex formed DRs, while species of subgenus Vignea did not. Species with DRs had higher root diesterase activity than species without DRs, exuded more citrate but less oxalate and less total carboxylates, and allocated less biomass to roots. Species with and without DRs showed similar growth responses to different forms of P and different amounts of P supplied; their natural habitats do not differ in soil fertility or degree of P limitation. Despite some differences in physiological function, DRs did not influence the P acquisition and nutritional niche of European Carex species, suggesting that species with and without DRs do not exhibit distinct P-acquisition strategies.

Root structures: !enhance! P acquisition 
DRs: !form in! subgenus Carex 
DRs: !increase! root diesterase activity 
DRs: !exude! citrate 
DRs: !allocate! less biomass to roots 
DRs: !do not influence! P acquisition and nutritional niche
