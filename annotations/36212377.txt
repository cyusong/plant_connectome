To date, no ideal effective method for controlling Verticillium wilt in upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) has been defined. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects and mechanism through which flagellin C (<i>FLiC</i>) regulates the <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> cation/proton exchanger 3 gene (<i>GhCAX3</i>), induces plant immunity, and increases resistance to Verticillium wilt. The FLiC gene was cloned from an endophytic bacterium (<i>Pseudomonas</i>) isolated from roots of the upland cotton cultivar Zhongmiansuo 41. The biocontrol effects of FLiC purified <i>in vitro</i> on resistant and susceptible upland cotton cultivars were 47.50 and 32.42%, respectively. FLiC induced a hypersensitive response (HR) in leaves of tobacco and immune responses in upland cotton. Transcriptome data showed that treatment with FLiC significantly enriched the calcium antiporter activity-associated disease-resistant metabolic pathway in seedlings. Moreover, FLiC downregulated <i>GhCAX3</i> expression to increase intracellular calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) content and stimulate increases in the intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide (NO) contents. The coordinated regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and NO enhanced cotton resistance to Verticillium wilt. Furthermore, transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants overexpressing <i>FLiC</i> showed significantly improved resistance to Verticillium wilt. <i>FLiC</i> may be used as a resistance gene and a regulator to improve resistance to <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> (VD) in upland cotton.
