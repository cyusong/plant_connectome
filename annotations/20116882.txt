Iron deficiency affects the function of the respiratory chain, primarily at the complex I and complex II levels. Because plant mitochondria possess alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenases located in the inner membrane, oxidizing NAD(P)H from both cytosol and matrix, we investigated these activities in mitochondria of Fe-deficient roots. External and internal NAD(P)H dehydrogenase activity increased in Fe-deficient mitochondria. Accordingly, NDB1 protein strongly accumulated, while NDA1 did not show differences in Fe-deficient roots. The data presented support, for the first time, the hypothesis that Fe deficiency induces the alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenases, bypassing the impaired complex I.

Iron deficiency: !affects! Function of respiratory chain
NDB1 protein: !accumulates! in Fe-deficient mitochondria
Fe deficiency: !induces! Alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenases
