Overexpression of JcSEP3 causes defective stamen development in Jatropha curcas, in which brassinosteroid and gibberellin signaling pathways may be involved. SEPALLATAs (SEPs), the class E genes of the ABCE model, are required for floral organ determination. In this study, we investigated the role of the JcSEP3 gene in floral organ development in the woody plant Jatropha curcas. Transgenic Jatropha plants overexpressing JcSEP3 displayed abnormal phenotypes such as deficient anthers and pollen, as well as free stamen filaments, whereas JcSEP3-RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants had no obvious phenotypic changes, suggesting that JcSEP3 is redundant with other JcSEP genes in Jatropha. Moreover, we compared the transcriptomes of wild-type plants, JcSEP3-overexpressing, and JcSEP3-RNAi transgenic plants. In the JcSEP3-overexpressing transgenic plants, we discovered 25 upregulated genes involved in anther and pollen development, as well as 12 induced genes in brassinosteroid (BR) and gibberellin (GA) signaling pathways. These results suggest that JcSEP3 directly or indirectly regulates stamen development, concomitant with the regulation of BR and GA signaling pathways. Our findings help to understand the roles of SEP genes in stamen development in perennial woody plants.
