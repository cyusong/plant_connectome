['23314820', 'Branching is an important trait of plant development regulated by environmental  signals. Phytochromes in Arabidopsis mediate branching in response to the changes  in the red light:far-red light ratio (R:FR), the mechanisms of which are still  elusive. Here it is shown that overexpression of CONSTANS-LIKE 7 (COL7) results  in an abundant branching phenotype which could be efficiently suppressed by shade  or a simulated shade environment (low R:FR). Moreover, col7 mutants develop  shorter hypocotyls and COL7 overexpression lines develop longer hypocotyls in  comparison with the wild type in low R:FR, indicating that COL7 acts as an  enhancer of the shade avoidance response. In shade or transient low R:FR,  transcriptional and post-transcriptional expression levels of COL7 are  up-regulated and positively associated with rapid mRNA accumulation of  PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE 1 (PIL1), a marker gene of shade avoidance  syndrome (SAS). Taken together, the results suggest a dual role for COL7 which  promotes branching in high R:FR conditions but enhances SAS in low R:FR  conditions.', '2013 Feb', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ers376', 'Liu']
