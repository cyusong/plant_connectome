In tomato, the ovary is covered with a thin, electron-dense and uniform cuticle. The first 10 d after anthesis are critical in the cutinisation of the outer epidermal wall. During this period, singular cytoplasmic domains have been identified in the epidermal cells which seem to be involved in lipid biosynthesis. Moreover, the inner side of the procuticle showed a globular structure with vesicle-like particles of different size that seemed to migrate from the cytoplasm to the procuticle. These electron-dense particles are postulated to play an important role in early cutin synthesis.
