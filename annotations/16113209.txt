['16113209', 'Peroxisomes perform diverse and vital functions in eukaryotes, and abnormalities  in peroxisomal function lead to severe developmental disorders in humans.  Peroxisomes are also involved in a wide array of physiological and metabolic  functions unique to plants, yet many aspects of this important organelle are  poorly understood. In yeast and mammals, various steps in peroxisome biogenesis  require the function of peroxin (PEX) proteins, among which PEX12 is a RING  finger peroxisomal membrane protein involved in the import of matrix proteins. To  investigate the role of PEX12 in plants, we identified a T-DNA knockout allele of  PEX12 and generated partial loss-of-function pex12 mutants using RNA  interference. We show that pex12 null mutants are developmentally arrested during  early embryogenesis, and that the embryo-lethal phenotype can be rescued by  overexpression of the PEX12-cyan fluorescent protein fusion protein, which  targets to the peroxisome. Using virus-induced gene-silencing techniques, we  demonstrate that peroxisomal number and fluorescence of the yellow fluorescent  protein-peroxisome targeting signal type 1 protein are greatly reduced when PEX12  is silenced. RNA interference plants with partial reduction of the PEX12  transcript exhibit impaired peroxisome biogenesis and function, inhibition of  plant growth, and reduced fertility. Our work provides evidence that the  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PEX12 protein is required for peroxisome  biogenesis and plays an essential role throughout plant development.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.066811', 'Hu']
