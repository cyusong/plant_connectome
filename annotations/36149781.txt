['36149781', 'DNA methylation, a conserved epigenetic mark, is critical for tuning temporal and  spatial gene expression. The Arabidopsis thaliana DNA glycosylase/lyase REPRESSOR  OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1) initiates active DNA demethylation and is required to  prevent DNA hypermethylation at thousands of genomic loci. However, how ROS1 is  recruited to specific loci is not well understood. Here, we report the discovery  of Arabidopsis AGENET Domain Containing Protein 3 (AGDP3) as a cellular factor  that is required to prevent gene silencing and DNA hypermethylation. AGDP3 binds  to H3K9me2 marks in its target DNA via its AGD12 cassette. Analysis of the  crystal structure of the AGD12 cassette of AGDP3 in complex with an H3K9me2  peptide revealed that dimethylated H3K9 and unmodified H3K4 are specifically  anchored into two different surface pockets. A histidine residue located in the  methyllysine binding aromatic cage provides AGDP3 with pH-dependent H3K9me2  binding capacity. Our results uncover a molecular mechanism for the regulation of  DNA demethylation by the gene silencing mark H3K9me2.', '2022 Dec', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.13369', 'ORCID:']
