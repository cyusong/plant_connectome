Plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) engage in mutually beneficial symbioses based on a reciprocal exchange of nutrients. The beneficial character of the symbiosis is maintained through a mechanism called autoregulation of mycorrhization (AOM). AOM includes root-to-shoot-to-root signaling; however, the molecular details of AOM are poorly understood. AOM shares many features of autoregulation of nodulation (AON) where several genes are known, including the receptor-like kinase SUPER NUMERIC NODULES (SUNN), root-to-shoot mobile CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION (ESR)-RELATED (CLE) peptides, and the hydroxyproline O-arabinosyltransferase ROOT DETERMINED NODULATION1 (RDN1) required for post-translational peptide modification. In this work, CLE53 was identified to negatively regulate AMF symbiosis in a SUNN- and RDN1-dependent manner. CLE53 expression was repressed at low phosphorus, while it was induced by AMF colonization and high phosphorus. CLE53 overexpression reduced AMF colonization in a SUNN- and RDN1 dependent manner, while cle53, rdn1, and sunn mutants were more colonized than the wild type. RNA-sequencing identified 700 genes with SUNN-dependent regulation in AMF-colonized plants, providing a resource for future identification of additional AOM genes. Disruption of AOM genes in crops potentially constitutes a novel route for improving AMF-derived phosphorus uptake in agricultural systems with high phosphorus levels.
