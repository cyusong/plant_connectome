Small RNAs are 20-24 nucleotides in length. In plants, small RNAs are classified into microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), based on their biogenesis and molecular features. In contrast to the extensive knowledge of the roles of small RNAs in sporophytic tissues, the distribution and function of small RNAs in gametophytic cells have been less well studied. However, with the improvement of single-cell sorting and RNA sequencing technologies, the distribution of small RNAs, especially siRNAs, between sperm cells and the vegetative cell, as well as the function of sperm-delivered small RNAs during early seed development have been elucidated. This review summarizes work from the past 5 years regarding small RNAs in male gametes, emphasizing the intercellular communication and biological significance of small RNAs in Arabidopsis.
