The circadian clock is a universal timing system that involved in plant physical responses to abiotic stresses. Moreover, OSCA1 is an osmosensor responsible for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases induced by osmotic stress in plants. However, there is little information on osmosensor involved osmotic stress-triggered circadian clock responses. Using an aequorin-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging assay, we found the gradient (0 mM, 200 mM, 500 mM) osmotic stress (induced by sorbitol) both altered the primary circadian parameter of WT and <i>osca1</i> mutant. This means the plant switch to a fast day/night model to avoid energy consumption. In contrast, the period of WT and <i>osca1</i> mutant became short since the sorbitol concentration increased from 0 mM to 500 mM. As the sorbitol concentration increased, the phase of the WT becomes more extensive compared with <i>osca1</i> mutant, which means WT is more capable of coping with the environmental change. Moreover, the amplitude of WT also becomes broader than <i>osca1</i> mutant, especially in high (500 mM) sorbitol concentration, indicate the WT shows more responses in high osmotic stress. In a word, the WT has much more flexibility to cope with the osmotic stress than <i>osca1</i> mutant. It implies the OSCA1 might be involved in the circadian gated plant adaptation to the environmental osmotic stress, which opens an avenue to study Ca<sup>2+</sup> processes with other circadian signaling pathways.
