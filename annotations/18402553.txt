PtdIns is an important precursor for inositol-containing lipids, including polyphosphoinositides, which have multiple essential functions in eukaryotic cells. It was previously proposed that different regulatory functions of inositol-containing lipids may be performed by independent lipid pools; however, it remains unclear how such subcellular pools are established and maintained. In the present paper, a previously uncharacterized Arabidopsis gene product with similarity to the known Arabidopsis PIS (PtdIns synthase), PIS1, is shown to be an active enzyme, PIS2, capable of producing PtdIns in vitro. PIS1 and PIS2 diverged slightly in substrate preferences for CDP-DAG [cytidinediphospho-DAG (diacylglycerol)] species differing in fatty acid composition, PIS2 preferring unsaturated substrates in vitro. Transient expression of fluorescently tagged PIS1 or PIS2 in onion epidermal cells indicates localization of both enzymes in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and, possibly, Golgi, as was reported previously for fungal and mammalian homologues. Constitutive ectopic overexpression of PIS1 or PIS2 in Arabidopsis plants resulted in elevated levels of PtdIns in leaves. PIS2-overexpressors additionally exhibited significantly elevated levels of PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P(2), whereas polyphosphoinositides were not elevated in plants overexpressing PIS1. In contrast, PIS1-overexpressors contained significantly elevated levels of DAG and PtdEtn (phosphatidylethanolamine), an effect not observed in plants overexpressing PIS2. Biochemical analysis of transgenic plants with regards to fatty acids associated with relevant lipids indicates that lipids increasing with PIS1 overexpression were enriched in saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids, whereas lipids increasing with PIS2 overexpression, including polyphosphoinositides, contained more unsaturated fatty acids. The results indicate that PtdIns populations originating from different PIS isoforms may enter alternative routes of metabolic conversion, possibly based on specificity and immediate metabolic context of the biosynthetic enzymes.
