The objective of this work was to explore the hypothesis that nitric oxide (NO) affects Fe bioavailability in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) embryonic axes. NO content was assessed in embryonic axes isolated from seeds control or exposed to NO-donors, employing spin trapping electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methodology. NO donors such as sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and diethylenetriamine NONOate (DETA NONOate), released NO that permeated inside the axes increasing NO content. Under these conditions low temperature EPR was employed to study the labile iron pool. A 2.5 fold increase was observed in NO steady state concentration after 24 h of exposure to NO donors that was correlated to a 2 fold increase in the Fe labile pool, as compared to control axes. This observation provides experimental evidence for a potential role of NO in Fe homeostasis.
