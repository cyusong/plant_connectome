The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) plays an important role in defense response and plant development. Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins act as transcriptional repressors of plant responses to JA. In this study, we found that OsNINJA1, which is a JAZ-interacting adaptor protein, plays an important role in JA signaling that is positively regulated by the transcription factor OsMYC2 in rice. The expression of OsNINJA1 was upregulated at an early phase after JA treatment, and OsNINJA1 interacted with several OsJAZ proteins in a C domain-dependent manner. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNINJA1 exhibited a JA-insensitive phenotype and were more susceptible to rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which is one of the most serious diseases affecting rice. Furthermore, OsNINJA1 negatively affected JA-regulated leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence conditions. Finally, the expression of OsMYC2-responsive pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and senescence-associated genes (SAGs) tended to be downregulated in the OsNINJA1-overexpressing rice plants. These results indicate that OsNINJA1 acts as a negative regulator of OsMYC2-mediated JA signaling in rice.
