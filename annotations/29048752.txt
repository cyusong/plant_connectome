Since the identification of the first miRNA, lin-4, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in 1993, thousands of miRNAs have been discovered in animals and plants, and their regulatory roles in numerous biological processes have been uncovered. In plants, research efforts have established the major molecular framework of miRNA biogenesis and modes of action, and are beginning to elucidate the mechanisms of miRNA degradation. Studies have implicated restricted and surprising subcellular locations in which miRNA biogenesis or activity takes place. In this article, we summarize the current knowledge on how plant miRNAs are made and degraded, and how they repress target gene expression. We discuss not only the players involved in these processes, but also the subcellular sites in which these processes are known or implicated to take place. We hope to raise awareness that the cell biology of miRNAs holds the key to a full understanding of these enigmatic molecules.
