['21455630', 'A leaf undergoes determinate growth from a primordium on flank of the shoot  apical meristem. Several intrinsic pathways restrict meristematic activity in the  leaf of Arabidopsis; however, other factors remain to be defined. We report here  that the overexpression of MINI ZINC FINGER1 (MIF1) or MIF3 disrupted the leaf  determinate growth by inducing ectopic shoot meristems on leaf margins. These  ectopic meristems occurred along margins of late rosette leaves at serration  sinuses in an ERECTA-dependent manner. Expression of STM was activated in these  ectopic meristems but not other leaf regions. The formation of ectopic meristems  was independent of the BP gene but suppressed by exogenous gibberellic acid. In  addition, reduced auxin response along leaf margins and subsequent response peak  in the sinus were correlated with the occurrence of ectopic meristems. Our  results suggest that the sinus of leaf serration is a quiescent domain possessing  the potential for meristem formation. MIF1- or MIF3-overexpressing transgenic  plants may provide a new genetic system for dissecting the molecular mechanism  that maintains leaf determinate growth, and for understanding the interactions  between hormone actions and meristematic activity.', '2011 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-011-9768-y', 'Ma']
