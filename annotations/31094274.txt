Plant regeneration involves critical checkpoints including pluripotency acquisition and <i>de novo</i> organogenesis. However, comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie plant regeneration remains limited. Here, we found that calli derived from jasmonate (JA)-pretreated hypocotyl explants exhibited increased rates of <i>de novo</i> shoot regeneration. In contrast, exogenous JA treatment during callus formation on CIM did not influence the plant regeneration process. The enhanced shoot regeneration was diminished in <i>coi1-1</i> mutants, indicating that JA-pretreated explants potentiate shoot regeneration in a COI1-dependent manner. These results suggest that the JA-responsive COI1 protein likely contributes to plant regeneration efficiency via regulation of hormone-signaling crosstalk and/or cell proliferation.
