Salinity negatively affects plant growth and disturbs chloroplast integrity. Here, we aimed at identifying salt-responsive translation-related genes in Arabidopsis thaliana with an emphasis on those encoding plastid-located proteins. We used quantitative real-time PCR to test the expression of 170 genes after short-term salt stress (up to 24 h) and identified several genes affected by the stress including: PRPL11, encoding plastid ribosomal protein L11, ATAB2, encoding a chloroplast-located RNA-binding protein presumably functioning as an activator of translation, and PDF1B, encoding a peptide deformylase involved in N-formyl group removal from nascent proteins synthesized in chloroplasts. These genes were previously shown to have important functions in chloroplast biology and may therefore represent new targets for biotechnological optimization of salinity tolerance.

PRPL11: !encodes! plastid ribosomal protein L11
ATAB2: !encodes! chloroplast-located RNA-binding protein
PDF1B: !encodes! peptide deformylase
Salt Stress: !affects! PRPL11, ATAB2, PDF1B expression
RNA-binding protein: !activates! translation
Peptide deformylase: !removes! N-formyl group from nascent proteins
