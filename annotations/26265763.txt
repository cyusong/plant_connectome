Computational tomography is an important technique for developing digital agricultural models that may help farmers and breeders for increasing crop quality and yield. In the present study an attempt has been made to understand rice seed development within the panicle at different developmental stages using this technique. During the first phase of cell division the Hounsfield Unit (HU) value remained low, increased in the dry matter accumulation phase, and finally reached a maximum at the maturation stage. HU value and seed dry weight showed a linear relationship in the varieties studied. This relationship was confirmed subsequently using seven other varieties. This is therefore an easy, simple, and non-invasive technique which may help breeders to select the best varieties. In addition, it may also help farmers to optimize post-anthesis agronomic practices as well as deciding the crop harvest time for higher grain yield.
