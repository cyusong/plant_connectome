The bZIP proteins comprise one of the largest transcription factor families and play important roles in plant growth and development, senescence, metabolic reactions, and stress responses. In this study, 49 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes (<i>StbZIP</i> genes) on the potato genome were identified and analyzed. The 49 <i>StbZIP</i> genes, which are located on 12 chromosomes of the potato genome, were divided into 11 subgroups together with their <i>Arabidopsis</i> homologs based on the results of phylogenetic analysis. Gene structure and protein motif analysis revealed that members from the same subgroup often possessed similar exon/intron structures and motif organizations, further supporting the results of the phylogenetic analysis. Syntenic analysis indicated the existence of gene duplication events, which might play an important role in the expansion of the <i>bZIP</i> gene family in potato. Expressions of the <i>StbZIP</i> genes were analyzed in a variety of tissues <i>via</i> RNA-Seq data, suggesting functional diversity. Several <i>StbZIP</i> genes were found to be induced by different stress conditions. For example, the expression of <i>StbZIP25</i>, the close homolog of AtbZIP36/ABF2, was significantly upregulated by salt stress treatments. The StbZIP25 protein was found to be located in the nucleus and function as a transcriptional activator. Overexpression of <i>StbZIP25</i> enhanced salt tolerance in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The results from this study imply potential roles of the bZIP family genes in the stress response of potato.
