Numerous reports have shown that various rhizobia can interact with non-host plant species, improving mineral nutrition and promoting plant growth. To further investigate the effects of such non-host interactions on root development and functions, we inoculated Arabidopsis thaliana with the model nitrogen fixing rhizobacterium Mesorhizobium loti (strain MAFF303099). In vitro, we show that root colonization by M. loti remains epiphytic and that M. loti cells preferentially grow at sites where primary and secondary roots intersect. Besides resulting in an increase in shoot biomass production, colonization leads to transient inhibition of primary root growth, strong promotion of root hair elongation and increased apoplasmic acidification in periphery cells of a sizeable part of the root system. Using auxin mutants, axr1-3 and aux1-100, we show that a plant auxin pathway plays a major role in inhibiting root growth but not in promoting root hair elongation, indicating that root developmental responses involve several distinct pathways. Finally, using a split root device, we demonstrate that root colonization by M. loti, as well as by the bona fide plant growth promoting rhizobacteria Azospirillum brasilense and Pseudomonas, affect root development via local transduction pathways restricted to the colonised regions of the root system.
