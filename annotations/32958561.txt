Pathogens disturb alternative splicing patterns of infected eukaryotic hosts. However, in plants it is unknown if this is incidental to infection or represents a pathogen-induced remodeling of host gene expression needed to support infection. Here, we compared changes in transcription and protein accumulation with changes in transcript splicing patterns in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) infected with the globally important pathogen sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). Our results suggested that changes in alternative splicing play a major role in determining virus-induced proteomic changes. Focusing on maize <i>phytoene synthase1</i> (<i>ZmPSY1</i>), which encodes the key regulatory enzyme in carotenoid biosynthesis, we found that although SCMV infection decreases total <i>ZmPSY1</i> transcript accumulation, the proportion of splice variant T001 increases by later infection stages so that ZmPSY1 protein levels are maintained. We determined that <i>ZmPSY1</i> has two leaf-specific transcripts, T001 and T003, distinguished by differences between the respective 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs). The shorter 3'-UTR of T001 makes it the more efficient mRNA. Nonsense <i>ZmPSY1</i> mutants or virus-induced silencing of <i>ZmPSY1</i> expression suppressed SCMV accumulation, attenuated symptoms, and decreased chloroplast damage. Thus, ZmPSY1 acts as a proviral host factor that is required for virus accumulation and pathogenesis. Taken together, our findings reveal that SCMV infection-modulated alternative splicing ensures that ZmPSY1 synthesis is sustained during infection, which supports efficient virus infection.
