The ubiquitous glyoxalase enzymatic pathway is involved in the detoxification of methylglyoxal (MG), a cytotoxic byproduct of glycolysis. The glyoxalase system has been more extensively studied in animals versus plants. Plant glyoxalases have been primarily associated with stress responses and their overexpression is known to impart tolerance to various abiotic stresses. In plants, glyoxalases exist as multigene families, and new roles for glyoxalases in various developmental and signaling pathways have started to emerge. Glyoxalase-based MG detoxification has now been shown to be important for pollination responses. During self-incompatibility response in Brassicaceae, MG is required to target compatibility factors for proteasomal degradation, while accumulation of glyoxalase leads to MG detoxification and efficient pollination. In this review, we discuss the importance of glyoxalase systems and their emerging biological roles in plants.
