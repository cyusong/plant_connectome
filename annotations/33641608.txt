Cold stress is a major environmental constraint that restrains plant growth and productivity. To cope with cold stress, plants must be able to perceive a cold signal and regulate the expression of cold-regulated (<i>COR</i>) genes. In our recent study, we showed that <i>Arabidopsis</i> HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE 15 (HOS15) acts as a substrate receptor for CULLIN4-based ubiquitin E3 ligase complex to promote cold-induced histone deacetylase 2 C (HD2C) degradation that allows the activation of <i>COR</i> genes. Additionally, we found that POWERDRESS (PWR), a HOS15-interacting protein, is required for the association of HOS15 with <i>COR</i> gene chromatin and HD2C degradation. The HOS15/PWR complex interacts with and recruits CBF transcription factors to the promoters of <i>COR</i> genes. Collectively, our previous findings suggest that HOS15 and PWR function as positive regulators for the expression of <i>COR</i> genes, and promote cold tolerance. Accordingly, we herein discuss the role of PWR in cold tolerance.

HOS15: !promotes! HD2C degradation
HOS15: !interacts with! PWR
PWR: !interacts with! HOS15
PWR: !recruits! CBF transcription factors
CBF transcription factors: !activate! COR genes
HOS15/PWR complex: !promotes! cold tolerance
