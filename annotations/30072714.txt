['30072714', 'The expression of hundreds of genes is induced by low temperatures via a cold  signaling pathway. ICE1, a MYC-type transcription factor, plays an important role  in the induction of CBF3/DREB1A to control cold-responsive genes and cold  tolerance. To elucidate other molecular factors, a yeast 2-hybrid screening was  performed. Two MYC-type transcription factors, MYC67 and MYC70, were identified  as ICE1-interacting proteins. The myc mutants were more tolerant to freezing  temperatures than wild type. CBF3/DREB1A and other cold-responsive genes were  up-regulated in the myc mutants. Overexpression of the MYC genes increased the  cold sensitivity and down-regulated the expression of cold-responsive genes. The  MYC proteins interacted with the cis-elements in the CBF3/DREB1A promoter,  probably to interfere interaction between ICE1 and the cis-elements. Taken  together, these results demonstrate that MYC67 and MYC70, ICE1 interactors,  negatively regulate cold-responsive genes and cold tolerance.', '2018 Aug 2', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/s41598-018-29722-x', 'ORCID:']
