VviNAC17 is a grapevine transcription factor activated by ABA. Because ABA has been proposed as the main signal modulating the secondary metabolism in grape berry skins, here we postulated VviNAC17 as a positive regulator of secondary metabolism in grape cells. To validate the hypothesis, <i>VviNAC17</i> was constitutively and stably overexpressed in grape berry suspension-cultured cells of Gamay Fréaux cv. by <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation. Targeted transcriptional analyses by qPCR showed that several genes involved the phenylpropanoid (<i>VviPAL1</i>), stilbenoid (<i>VviSTS1</i>) and flavonoid pathways (<i>VviDFR</i>, <i>VviLAR1</i>, <i>VviANR</i>, <i>VviLDOX</i>, and <i>VviUFGT1</i>), as well as anthocyanin vacuolar transport and accumulation (<i>VviGST4</i> and <i>VvMATE1</i>) were significantly upregulated in VviNAC17-overexpressing transgenic cells, which translated in the stimulation of a number of enzymatic activities in those pathways. This was the case of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) that were about 2-fold and 3.5-fold higher in VviNAC17-overexpressing cells than in control cells. VviNAC17-overexpressing cells accumulated significantly higher amounts of anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, total flavonoids and total phenolics. These findings confirmed that <i>VviNAC17</i> is an important positive regulator of secondary metabolism in grapevine contributing to the accumulation of important berry quality-related secondary metabolites.
