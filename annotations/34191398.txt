An enhanced CDA-like (eCDAL) was established from Japanese lamprey CDA1-like 4 to achieve a high editing frequency in a broad region as a C-terminal cytosine base editors (CT-CBE). Then, a novel plant dual-base editor version 1(pDuBE1) was developed by integrating TadA-8e into eCDAL. The editing efficiency of pDuBE1 could reach to 87.6%, with frequencies of concurrent A-to-G and C-to-T conversions as high as 49.7% in stably transformed plant cells. Our results showed that pDuBE1 could mediate robust dual editing in plant genome, providing a powerful manipulation tool for precise crop breeding and screening platforms for in planta direct evolution.
