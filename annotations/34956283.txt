Nitric oxide (NO) is a short-lived radical gas that acts as a signaling molecule in all higher organisms, and that is involved in multiple plant processes, including germination, root growth, and fertility. Regulation of NO-levels is predominantly achieved by reaction of oxidation products of NO with glutathione to form <i>S</i>-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), the principal bioactive form of NO. The enzyme <i>S</i>-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) is a major route of NADH-dependent GSNO catabolism and is critical to NO homeostasis. Here, we performed a proteomic analysis examining changes in the total leaf proteome of an <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> GSNOR null mutant (<i>hot5-2/gsnor1-3</i>). Significant increases or decreases in proteins associated with chlorophyll metabolism and with redox and stress metabolism provide insight into phenotypes observed in <i>hot5-2/gsnor1-3</i> plants. Importantly, we identified a significant increase in proteins that belong to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) protein superfamily, AKR4C8 and 9. Because specific AKRs have been linked to NO metabolism in mammals, we expressed and purified <i>A. thaliana</i> AKR4C8 and 9 and close homologs AKR4C10 and 11 and determined that they have NADPH-dependent activity in GSNO and <i>S</i>-nitroso-coenzyme A (SNO-CoA) reduction. Further, we found an increase of NADPH-dependent GSNO reduction activity in <i>hot5-2/gsnor1-3</i> mutant plants. These data uncover a new, NADPH-dependent component of NO metabolism that may be integrated with NADH-dependent GSNOR activity to control NO homeostasis in plants.
