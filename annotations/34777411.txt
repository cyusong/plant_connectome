The aim of this study was to better understand the response of <i>ex vitro</i> acclimatized plants grown to a set of mineral nutrient combinations based on Hoagland solution. To reach that, two computer-based tools were used: the design of experiments (DOE) and a hybrid artificial intelligence technology that combines artificial neural networks with fuzzy logic. DOE was employed to create a five-dimensional IV-design space by categorizing all macroelements and one microelement (copper) of Hoagland mineral solution, reducing the experimental design space from 243 (3<sup>5</sup>) to 19 treatments. Typical growth parameters included hardening efficiency (Hard), newly formed shoot length (SL), total leaf number (TLN), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), and leaf area (LA). Moreover, three physiological disorders, namely, leaf necrosis (LN), leaf spot (LS), and curled leaf (CL), were evaluated for each treatment (mineral formulation). All the growth parameters plus LN were successfully modeled using neuro-fuzzy logic with a high train set <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> between experimental and predicted values (72.67 < <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> < 98.79). The model deciphered new insights using different sets of "IF-THEN" rules, pinpointing the positive role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> to improve Hard, SL, TLN, and LA and alleviate LN but with opposite influences on LCC. On the contrary, TLN and LCC were negatively affected by the addition of NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> into the media, while NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> in complex interaction with Cu<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> positively enhanced SL, TLN, LCC, and LA. In our opinion, the approach and results achieved in this work are extremely fruitful to understand the effect of Hoagland mineral nutrients on the healthy growth of <i>ex vitro</i> acclimatized plants, through identifying key factors, which favor growth and limit physiological abnormalities.
