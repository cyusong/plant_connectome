Soil salinity is a major challenge that will be faced more and more by human population in the near future. Higher salt concentrations in the soil limit the growth and production of crops, which poses serious threats to global food production. Various plant breeding approaches have been followed in the past which are reported to reduce the effect of salt stress by inducing the level of protective metabolites like osmolytes and antioxidants. Conventional breeding approaches are time-consuming and not cost-effective. In recent times, genetic engineering has been largely followed to confer salt tolerance through introgressions of single transgenes or stacking multiple transgenes. However, most of such works are limited only at the laboratory level and field trials are still awaited to prove the long-term efficacy of such transgenics. In this review, we attempt to present a broad overview of the current strategies undertaken to develop halophytic and salt-tolerant crops. The salt-induced damages in the plants are highlighted, followed by representing the novel traits, associated with salt stress, which can be used for engineering salt tolerance in glycophytic crops. Additionally, the role of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation in plants for amelioration of salt-induced damages has been reviewed. The role of post-transcriptional mechanisms such as microRNA regulation, genome editing and alternative splicing, during salt stress, and their implications in the development of salt-tolerant crops are also discussed. Finally, we present a short overview about the role of ion transporters and rhizobacteria in the engineering of salt tolerance in crop species.
