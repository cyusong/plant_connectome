['11701877', 'The COP9 signalosome is a highly conserved protein complex initially identified  as a repressor of photomorphogenesis. Here, we report that subunit 6 of the  Arabidopsis COP9 signalosome is encoded by a family of two genes (CSN6A and  CSN6B) located on chromosomes V and IV, respectively. The CSN6A and CSN6B  proteins share 87% amino acid identity and contain a MPR1p and PAD1p N-terminal  (MPN) domain at the N-terminal region. The CSN6 proteins share homology with CSN5  and belong to the Mov34 superfamily of proteins. CSN6 proteins present only in  the complex form and coimmunoprecipitate with other known subunits of the COP9  signalosome. Partial loss-of-function strains of the COP9 signalosome created by  antisense and cosuppression with CSN6A exhibit diverse developmental defects,  including homeotic organ transformation, symmetric body organization, and organ  boundary definition. Protein blot analysis revealed that the defective plants  accumulate significant amounts of ubiquitinated proteins, supporting the  conclusion that the COP9 signalosome regulates multifaceted developmental  processes through its involvement in ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated protein  degradation.', '2001 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010248', 'Deng']
