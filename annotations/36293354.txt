Following pathogen infection, plants have developed diverse mechanisms that direct their immune systems towards more robust induction of defense responses against recurrent environmental stresses. The induced resistances could be inherited by the progenies, rendering them more tolerant to stressful events. Although within-generational induction of tolerance to abiotic stress is a well-documented phenomenon in virus-infected plants, the transgenerational inheritance of tolerance to abiotic stresses in their progenies has not been explored. Here, we show that infection of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> plants by <i>Potato virus X</i> (PVX) and by a chimeric <i>Plum pox virus</i> (PPV) expressing the P25 pathogenicity protein of PVX (PPV-P25), but not by PPV, conferred tolerance to both salt and osmotic stresses to the progeny, which correlated with the level of virulence of the pathogen. This transgenerational tolerance to abiotic stresses in the progeny was partially sustained even if the plants experience a virus-free generation. Moreover, progenies from a <i>Dicer-like3</i> mutant mimicked the enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress observed in progenies of PVX-infected wild-type plants. This phenotype was shown irrespective of whether <i>Dicer-like3</i> parents were infected, suggesting the involvement of 24-nt small interfering RNAs in the transgenerational tolerance to abiotic stress induced by virus infection. RNAseq analysis supported the upregulation of genes related to protein folding and response to stress in the progeny of PVX-infected plants. From an environmental point of view, the significance of virus-induced transgenerational tolerance to abiotic stress could be questionable, as its induction was offset by major reproductive costs arising from a detrimental effect on seed production.
