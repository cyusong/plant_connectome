['9421527', 'UV radiation induces two major classes of pyrimidine dimers: the pyrimidine [6-4]  pyrimidone photoproduct (6-4 product) and the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD).  Many organisms produce enzymes, termed photolyases, that specifically bind to  these damage products and split them via a UV-A/blue light-dependent mechanism,  thereby reversing the damage. These photolyases are specific for either CPDs or  6-4 products. A gene that expresses a protein with 6-4 photolyase activity in  vitro was recently cloned from Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis. We  report here the isolation of a homolog of this gene, cloned on the basis of  sequence similarity, from the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This cloned gene  produces a protein with 6-4 photolyase activity when expressed in Escherichia  coli. We also find that a previously described mutant of Arabidopsis (uvr3) that  is defective in photoreactivation of 6-4 products carries a nonsense mutation in  this 6-4 photolyase homolog. We have therefore termed this gene UVR3. Although  homologs of this gene have previously been shown to produce a functional 6-4  photolyase when expressed in heterologous systems, this is the first  demonstration of a requirement for this gene for photoreactivation of 6-4  products in vivo.', '1998 Jan 15', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/26.2.638', 'Yamamoto']
