The myeloblastosis (MYB) proteins perform key functions in mediating cadmium (Cd) tolerance of plants. <i>Ipomoea aquatica</i> has strong adaptability to Cd Stress, while the roles of the <i>I. aquatica MYB</i> gene family with respect to Cd stress are still unclear. Here, we identified a total of 183 <i>MYB</i> genes in the <i>I. aquatica</i> genome (<i>laMYB</i>), which were classified into 66 1R-type <i>IaMYB</i>, 112 2R-type <i>IaMYB</i>, four 3R-type <i>IaMYB</i>, and one 4R-type <i>IaMYB</i> based on the number of the MYB repeat in each gene. The analysis of phylogenetic tree indicated that most of <i>IaMYB</i> genes are associated with the diverse biological processes including defense, development and metabolism. Analysis of sequence features showed that the <i>IaMYB</i> genes within identical subfamily have the similar patterns of the motif distributions and gene structures. Analysis of gene duplication events revealed that the dispersed duplication (DSD) and whole-genome duplication (WGD) modes play vital roles in the expansion of the <i>IaMYB</i> gene family. Expression profiling manifests that approximately 20% of <i>IaMYB</i> genes had significant role in the roots of <i>I. aquatica</i> under Cd stress. Promoter profiling implied that the differentially expressed genes might be induced by environmental factors or inherent hormones and thereby execute their function in Cd response. Remarkably, the 2R-type <i>IaMYB157</i> with abundant light-responsive element G-box and ABA-responsive element ABRE in its promoter region exhibited very strong response to Cd stress. Taken together, our findings provide an important candidate <i>IaMYB</i> gene for further deciphering the molecular regulatory mechanism in plant with respect to Cd stress.
