It has not yet been reported how the secondary CESA (cellulose synthase) proteins are organized in the rosette structure. A membrane-based yeast two-hybrid (MbYTH) approach was used to analyze the interactions between the CESA proteins involved in secondary cell wall synthesis of Arabidopsis and the findings were confirmed in planta by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. Results indicated that although all CESA proteins can interact with each other, only CESA4 is able to form homodimers. A model is proposed for the secondary rosette structure. The RING-motif proved not to be essential for the interaction between the CESA proteins.
