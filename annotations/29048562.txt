According to the external coincidence model, photoperiodic flowering occurs when CONSTANS (CO) mRNA expression coincides with light in the afternoon of long days (LDs), leading to the activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). CO has evolved in Brassicaceae from other Group Ia CO-like (COL) proteins which do not control photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis. COLs in other species have evolved different functions as floral activators or even as repressors. To understand photoperiodic development in the perennial rosaceous model species woodland strawberry, we functionally characterized FvCO, the only Group Ia COL in its genome. We demonstrate that FvCO has a major role in the photoperiodic control of flowering and vegetative reproduction through runners. FvCO is needed to generate a bimodal rhythm of FvFT1 which encodes a floral activator in the LD accession Hawaii-4: a sharp FvCO expression peak at dawn is followed by the FvFT1 morning peak in LDs indicating possible direct regulation, but additional factors that may include FvGI and FvFKF1 are probably needed to schedule the second FvFT1 peak around dusk. These results demonstrate that although FvCO and FvFT1 play major roles in photoperiodic development, the CO-based external coincidence around dusk is not fully applicable to the woodland strawberry.
