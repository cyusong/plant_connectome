The apoplastic space between the plant cell wall and the plasma membrane constitutes a major battleground for plant-pathogen interactions. To survive in harsh conditions in the plant apoplast, pathogens must cope with various immune responses. During infection, plant pathogens secrete an arsenal of effector proteins into the apoplast milieu, some of which are detected by the plant surveillance system and, thus, activate plant innate immunity. Effectors that evade plant perception act in modulating plant apoplast immunity to favor successful pathogen infection. The concerted actions of apoplastic effectors often determine the outcomes of plant-pathogen interactions. In this review, we summarize current advances on the understanding of apoplastic effectors and highlight the strategies employed by pathogens to counter host apoplastic defense.

Pathogen: !secretes! Effector proteins 
Effectors: !evade! Plant perception 
Effectors: !modulate! Plant apoplastic immunity 
Pathogen: !counter! Host apoplastic defense
