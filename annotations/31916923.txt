Stemphylium leaf blight caused by <i>Stemphylium vesicarium</i> was recently identified as an emerging disease and dominant in the foliar disease complex affecting onion in New York. Here, we report the genomes of two isolates of <i>S. vesicarium</i>, On16-63 and On16-391. The availability of the genomes will accelerate genomic studies of <i>S. vesicarium</i>, including population biology, sexual reproduction, and fungicide resistance. Additionally, comparative genomics with the other published genome of <i>S. vesicarium</i> causing brown spot of pear will help understand pathogen biology and underpin the development of management strategies for this disease.
