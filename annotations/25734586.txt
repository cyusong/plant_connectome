The effect of drought on plant isoprene emission varies tremendously across species and environments. It was recently shown that an increased ratio of photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR) to net carbon assimilation rate (NAR) consistently supported increased emission under drought. In this commentary, we highlight some of the physiological aspects of drought tolerance that are central to the observed variability. We briefly discuss some of the issues that must be addressed in order to refine our understanding of plant isoprene emission response to drought and increasing global temperature.
