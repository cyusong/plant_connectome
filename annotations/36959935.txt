There is a long history of traditional medicine use. However, little genetic information is available for the plants used in traditional medicine, which limits the exploitation of these natural resources. Third-generation sequencing (TGS) techniques have made it possible to gather invaluable genetic information and develop herbal genomics. In this review, we introduce two main TGS techniques, PacBio SMRT technology and Oxford Nanopore technology, and compare the two techniques against Illumina, the predominant next-generation sequencing technique. In addition, we summarize the nuclear and organelle genome assemblies of commonly used medicinal plants, choose several examples from genomics, transcriptomics, and molecular identification studies to dissect the specific processes and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the two TGS techniques when applied to medicinal organisms. Finally, we describe how we expect that TGS techniques will be widely utilized to assemble telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genomes and in epigenomics research involving medicinal plants.
