Autophagy is a highly conserved quality control process that maintains cellular health by eliminating deleterious cargoes. Compared with the extensive studies in yeast and mammalian models, the molecular details and significance of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the autophagy process in plants remain less well defined. In this review, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of phosphorylation, one of the most extensively studied PTMs, in the regulation of autophagosome biogenesis and autophagic degradation in plants. Based on the plant mass spectrometric database, we summarize the experimentally verified phosphorylation sites of the core autophagy machinery in plants. Furthermore, we put forward several approaches to test the roles of phosphorylation in the regulation of plant autophagy.
