This study investigated the regulation of the exogenous strigolactone (SL) analog GR24 in enhancing the salt tolerance and the effects of calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) on GR24's regulation effects in cucumber. The seedlings were sprayed with (1) distilled water (CK), (2) NaCl, (3) GR24, then NaCl, (4) GR24, then H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenger, then NaCl, and (5) GR24, then Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocker, then NaCl. The second true leaf was selected for biochemical assays. Under the salt stress, the exogenous GR24 maintained the ion balance, increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, reduced the membrane lipid peroxidation, and increased the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), accompanied by a decrease in relative conductivity, an increase in the proline content, and elevated gene expression levels of antioxidant enzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), salt overly sensitive SOS1, CBL-interacting protein kinase 2 (CIPK2), and calcineurin B-like protein 3 (CBL3). Such protective effects triggered by GR24 were attenuated or almost abolished by ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), lanthanum chloride (LaCl3, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, NADPH oxidase inhibitor), and dimethylthiourea (DMTU, hydroxyl radical scavenger). Our data suggest that exogenous GR24 is highly effective in alleviating salt-induced damages via modulating antioxidant capabilities and improving ionic homeostasis and osmotic balance and that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are required for GR24-mediated enhancement of salt tolerance.
