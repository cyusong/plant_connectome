Fiber quality is an important economic trait of cotton, and its improvement is a major goal of cotton breeding. To better understand the genetic mechanisms responsible for fiber quality traits, we conducted a genome-wide association study to identify and mine fiber-quality-related quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and genes. In total, 42 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 31 QTLs were identified as being significantly associated with five fiber quality traits. Twenty-five QTLs were identified in previous studies, and six novel QTLs were firstly identified in this study. In the QTL regions, 822 genes were identified and divided into four clusters based on their expression profiles. We also identified two pleiotropic SNPs. The SNP locus i52359Gb was associated with fiber elongation, strength, length and uniformity, while i11316Gh was associated with fiber strength and length. Moreover, these two SNPs were nonsynonymous and located in genes Gh_D09G2376 and Gh_D06G1908, respectively. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that these two genes were preferentially expressed at one or more stages of cotton fiber development, which was consistent with the RNA-seq data. Thus, Gh_D09G2376 and Gh_D06G1908 may be involved in fiber developmental processes. The findings of this study provide insights into the genetic bases of fiber quality traits, and the identified QTLs or genes may be applicable in cotton breeding to improve fiber quality.
