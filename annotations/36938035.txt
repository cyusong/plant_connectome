The flower buds of <i>Lonicera japonica</i> Thunb. are widely used in Chinese medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties, and they have played an important role in the fight against SARS COVID-19 and other major epidemics. However, due to the lack of scientific and accurate variety identification methods and national unified standards, scattered and non-standardized management in flower bud production has led to mixed varieties that have caused significant difficulties in the cataloging and preservation of germplasm resources and the identification, promotion, and application of new <i>L. japonica</i> varieties. In this study, we evaluated the population structure, genetic relationships, and genetic fingerprints of 39 germplasm resources of <i>Lonicera</i> in China using simplified genome sequencing technology. A total of 13,143,268 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Thirty-nine samples of <i>Lonicera</i> were divided into four subgroups, and the population structure and genetic relationships among existing <i>Lonicera</i> germplasm resources were determined using principal component analysis, population structure analysis, and phylogenetic tree analysis. Through several stringent selection criteria, 15 additional streamlined, high-quality DNA fingerprints were filtered out of the validated 50 SNP loci and verified as being able to effectively identify the 39 <i>Lonicera</i> varieties. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study measuring the diversity and population structure of a large collection of <i>Lonicera</i> varieties in China. These results have greatly broadened our understanding of the diversity, phylogeny, and population structure of <i>Lonicera</i>. The results may enhance the future analysis of genetic diversity, species identification, property rights disputes, and molecular breeding by providing a scientific basis and reference data for these efforts.
