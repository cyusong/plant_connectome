Tyrosine-specific protein tyrosine phosphatases (Tyr-specific PTPases) are key signaling enzymes catalyzing the removal of the phosphate group from phosphorylated tyrosine residues on target proteins. This post-translational modification notably allows the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades during defense reactions. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (<i>At</i>PTP1), the only Tyr-specific PTPase present in this plant, acts as a repressor of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and regulates the activity of MPK3/MPK6 MAPKs by direct dephosphorylation. Here, we report that recombinant histidine (His)-<i>At</i>PTP1 protein activity is directly inhibited by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and nitric oxide (NO) exogenous treatments. The effects of NO are exerted by S-nitrosation, i.e., the formation of a covalent bond between NO and a reduced cysteine residue. This post-translational modification targets the catalytic cysteine C265 and could protect the <i>At</i>PTP1 protein from its irreversible oxidation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This mechanism of protection could be a conserved mechanism in plant PTPases.

Tyr-specific PTPases: !catalyze! removal of phosphate group 
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: !inhibits! recombinant His-AtPTP1 protein activity 
NO: !S-nitrosates! catalytic cysteine C265 
NO: !protects! AtPTP1 protein from irreversible oxidation
