Root growth control plays an important role in plant adaptation to drought stress, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this control remain largely elusive. Here, a root-specific nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) transcription factor PdNF-YB21 was isolated from Populus. The functional mechanism of PdNF-YB21 was characterised by various morphological, physiological, molecular, biochemical and spectroscopy techniques. Overexpression of PdNF-YB21 in poplar promoted root growth with highly lignified and enlarged xylem vessels, resulting in increased drought resistance. By contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated poplar mutant nf-yb21 exhibited reduced root growth and drought resistance. PdNF-YB21 interacted with PdFUSCA3 (PdFUS3), a B3 domain transcription factor. PdFUS3 directly activated the promoter of the abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis key gene PdNCED3, resulting in a significant increase in root ABA content in poplars subjected to water deficit. Coexpression of poplar NF-YB21 and FUS3 significantly enhanced the expression of PdNCED3. Furthermore, ABA promoted indoylacetic acid transport in root tips, which ultimately increased root growth and drought resistance. Taken together, our data indicate that NF-YB21-FUS3-NCED3 functions as an important avenue in auxin-regulated poplar root growth in response to drought.
