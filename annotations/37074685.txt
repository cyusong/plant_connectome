Crop loss due to soil salinization is a global threat to agriculture. Nitric oxide (NO) and ethylene involve in multiple plant tolerance. However, their interaction in salt resistance remains largely elusive. We tested the mutual induction between NO and ethylene, and then identified an 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase homolog 4 (ACOh4) that influences ethylene synthesis and salt tolerance through NO-mediated S-nitrosylation. Both NO and ethylene positively responded to salt stress. Furthermore, NO participated in salt-induced ethylene production. Salt tolerance evaluation showed that function of NO was abolished by inhibiting ethylene production. Conversely, function of ethylene was little influenced by blocking NO generation. ACO was identified as the target of NO to control ethylene synthesis. In vitro and in vivo results suggested that ACOh4 was S-nitrosylated at Cys172, resulting in its enzymatic activation. Moreover, ACOh4 was induced by NO through transcriptional manner. Knockdown of ACOh4 abolished NO-induced ethylene production and salt tolerance. At physiological status, ACOh4 positively regulates the Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> efflux, and keeps K<sup>+</sup> /Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis by promoting salt-resistive genes' transcripts. Our findings validate a role of NO-ethylene module in salt tolerance and uncover a novel mechanism of how NO promoting ethylene synthesis against adversity.
