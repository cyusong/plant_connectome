['7781888', 'To investigate the genetic mechanism regulating Arabidopsis shoot maturation and  development, we characterized eight emf mutants that bypassed the vegetative  phase of the life cycle. Genetic complementation studies identified two EMF loci;  both mapped to chromosome five. Double mutant analysis showed that the early- and  late-flowering mutants, co, fb, elf1, elf2, and elf3, could not rescue vegetative  development in the emf mutants, confirming the need for both EMF gene activities  for rosette development. A series of phenotypes involving successive loss of  reproductive organs was also observed in emf single mutants, in emf1-1/emf1-2  transheterozygotes, and in emf1 emf2 double mutants, suggesting that the EMF  genes not only specify the rosette (vegetative) but also are involved in  inflorescence and flower (reproductive) development. Phenotypic analysis of  double mutants between emf and tfl1, lfy, and ag indicated interactions between  EMF and genes regulating inflorescence meristem development and floral organ  identity. A model depicting the role of the EMF genes in regulating shoot  maturation and their interaction with genes that affect phase transitions is  presented.', '1995 Jun', 'Dev Biol', '10.1006/dbio.1995.1158', 'Sung']
