Spring cold stress (SCS) compromises the reproductive growth of wheat, being a major constraint in achieving high grain yield and quality in winter wheat. To sustain wheat productivity in SCS conditions, breeding cultivars conferring cold tolerance is key. In this review, we examine how grain setting and quality traits are affected by SCS, which may occur at the pre-anthesis stage. We have investigated the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in floret and spikelet SCS tolerance. It includes the protective enzymes scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), hormonal adjustment, and carbohydrate metabolism. Lastly, we explored quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that regulate SCS for identifying candidate genes for breeding. The existing cultivars for SCS tolerance were primarily bred on agronomic and morphophysiological traits and lacked in molecular investigations. Therefore, breeding novel wheat cultivars based on QTLs and associated genes underlying the fundamental resistance mechanism is urgently needed to sustain grain setting and quality under SCS.
