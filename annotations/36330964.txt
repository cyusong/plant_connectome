Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is one of the most devastating viral pathogens of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr). In total, 22 Chinese SMV strains (SC1-SC22) have been classified based on the responses of 10 soybean cultivars to these pathogens. However, although several SMV-resistance loci in soybean have been identified, no gene conferring SMV resistance in the resistant soybean cultivar (cv.) Kefeng No.1 has been cloned and verified. Here, using F<sub>2</sub> -derived F<sub>3</sub> (F<sub>2:3</sub> ) and recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations from a cross between Kefeng No.1 and susceptible soybean cv. Nannong 1138-2, we localized the gene in Kefeng No.1 that mediated resistance to SMV-SC3 strain to a 90-kb interval on chromosome 2. To study the functions of candidate genes in this interval, we performed Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV)-induced gene silencing (VIGS). We identified a recombinant gene (which we named R<sub>SC3</sub> K) harboring an internal deletion of a genomic DNA fragment partially flanking the LOC100526921 and LOC100812666 reference genes as the SMV-SC3 resistance gene. By shuffling genes between infectious SMV DNA clones based on the avirulent isolate SC3 and virulent isolate 1129, we determined that the viral protein P3 is the avirulence determinant mediating SMV-SC3 resistance on Kefeng No.1. P3 interacts with RNase proteins encoded by R<sub>SC3</sub> K, LOC100526921, and LOC100812666. The recombinant R<sub>SC3</sub> K conveys much higher anti-SMV activity than LOC100526921 and LOC100812666, although those two genes also encode proteins that inhibit SMV accumulation, as revealed by gene silencing in a susceptible cultivar and by overexpression in Nicotiana benthamiana. These findings demonstrate that R<sub>SC3</sub> K mediates the resistance of Kefeng No.1 to SMV-SC3 and that SMV resistance of soybean is determined by the antiviral activity of RNase proteins.
