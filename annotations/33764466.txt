Cucurbits are economically important crops worldwide. The genomic data of many cucurbits are now available. However, functional analyses of cucurbit genes and noncoding RNAs have been impeded because genetic transformation is difficult for many cucurbitaceous plants. Here, we developed a set of tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV)-based vectors for gene and microRNA (miRNA) function studies in cucurbits. A TRSV-based expression vector could simultaneously express GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (GFP) and heterologous viral suppressors of RNA silencing in TRSV-infected plants, while a TRSV-based gene silencing vector could knock down endogenous genes exemplified by PHYTOENE DESATURASE (PDS) in Cucumis melo, Citrullus lanatus, Cucumis sativus, and Nicotiana benthamiana plants. We also developed a TRSV-based miRNA silencing vector to dissect the functions of endogenous miRNAs. Four representative miRNAs, namely, miR159, miR166, miR172, and miR319, from different cucurbits were inserted into the TRSV vector using a short tandem target mimic strategy and induced characteristic phenotypes in TRSV-miRNA-infected plants. This TRSV-based vector system will facilitate functional genomic studies in cucurbits.
