['20016941', 'We identified a Nodulin-related protein 1 (NRP1) encoded by At2g03440, which was  previously reported to be RPS2 interacting protein in yeast-two-hybrid assay.  Northern blotting showed that AtNRP1 expression was suppressed by heat stress (42  degrees C) and induced by low temperature (4 degrees C) treatment. Strong GUS  staining was observed in the sites of meristematic tissues of pAtNRP1:: GUS  transgenic plants, such as shoot apex and root tips, young leaf veins, stamens  and stigmas of flowers, and abscission layers of young siliques. To study AtNRP1  biological functions, we have characterized both loss-of-function T-DNA insertion  and transgenic overexpression plants for AtNRP1 in Arabidopsis. The T-DNA  insertion mutants displayed no obvious difference as compared to wild-type  Arabidopsis under heat stress, but the significant enhanced susceptibility to  heat stress was revealed in two independent AtNRP1-overexpressing transgenic  lines. Further study found that the decreased thermotolerance in  AtNRP1-overexpressing lines accompanied significantly decreased accumulation of  ABA after heat treatment, which was probably due to AtNRP1 playing a role in  negative-feedback regulation of the ABA synthesis pathway. These results support  the viewpoint that the application of ABA inhibits nodulation and nodulin-related  gene expression and threaten adverse ambient temperature can impact the  nodulin-related gene expression.', '2010 Jan', 'Mol Cells', '10.1007/s10059-010-0005-3', 'Yu']
