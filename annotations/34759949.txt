Multiple C2 domain and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) are a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins and show emerging roles in mediating protein trafficking and signaling transduction. Although, several studies showed that MCTPs play important roles during plant growth and development, their biological functions in cotton remain largely unknown. Here, we identify and characterize 33 <i>GhMCTP</i> genes from upland cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) and reveal the diverse expression patterns of <i>GhMCTPs</i> in various tissues. We also find that <i>GhMCTP7</i>, <i>GhMCTP12</i>, and <i>GhMCTP17</i> are highly expressed in the main stem apex, suggesting their possible roles in shoot development. Through analyzing different cotton species, we discover plant heights are closely related to the expression levels of <i>GhMCTP7</i>, <i>GhMCTP12</i>, and <i>GhMCTP17</i>. Furthermore, we silence the expression of <i>GhMCTP</i> genes using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system in cotton and find that <i>GhMCTP7</i>, <i>GhMCTP12</i>, and <i>GhMCTP17</i> play an essential role in shoot meristem development. GhMCTPs interact with GhKNAT1 and GhKNAT2 and regulate meristem development through integrating multiple signal pathways. Taken together, our results demonstrate functional redundancy of GhMCTPs in cotton shoot meristem development and provide a valuable resource to further study various functions of GhMCTPs in plant growth and development.
