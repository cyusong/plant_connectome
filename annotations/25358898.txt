During compatible virus infections, plants respond by reprogramming gene expression and metabolite content. While gene expression studies are profuse, our knowledge of the metabolic changes that occur in the presence of the virus is limited. Here, we combine gene expression and metabolite profiling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) infected with Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) in order to investigate the influence of primary metabolism on virus infection. Our results revealed that primary metabolism is reconfigured in many ways during TRV infection, as reflected by significant changes in the levels of sugars and amino acids. Multivariate data analysis revealed that these alterations were particularly conspicuous at the time points of maximal accumulation of TRV, although infection time was the dominant source of variance during the process. Furthermore, TRV caused changes in lipid and fatty acid composition in infected leaves. We found that several Arabidopsis mutants deficient in branched-chain amino acid catabolism or fatty acid metabolism possessed altered susceptibility to TRV. Finally, we showed that increments in the putrescine content in TRV-infected plants correlated with enhanced tolerance to freezing stress in TRV-infected plants and that impairment of putrescine biosynthesis promoted virus multiplication. Our results thus provide an interesting overview for a better understanding of the relationship between primary metabolism and virus infection.
