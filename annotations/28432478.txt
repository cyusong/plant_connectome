['28432478', "The Arabidopsis splicing factors, AtU2AF65, AtU2AF35, and AtSF1 shuttle between  nuclei and cytoplasms. These proteins also move rapidly and continuously in the  nuclei, and their movements are affected by ATP depletion. The U2AF65 proteins  are splicing factors that interact with SF1 and U2AF35 proteins to promote  U2snRNP for the recognition of the pre-mRNA 3' splice site during early  spliceosome assembly. We have determined the subcellular localization and  movement of these proteins' Arabidopsis homologs. It was found that Arabidopsis  U2AF65 homologs, AtU2AF65a, and AtU2AF65b proteins interact with AtU2AF35a and  AtU2AF35b, which are Arabidopsis U2AF35 homologs. We have examined the mobility  of these proteins including AtSF1 using fluorescence recovery after  photobleaching and fluorescence loss in photobleaching analyses. These proteins  displayed dynamic movements in nuclei and their movements were affected by ATP  depletion. We have also demonstrated that these proteins shuttle between nuclei  and cytoplasms, suggesting that they may also function in cytoplasm. These  results indicate that such splicing factors show very similar characteristics to  their human counterparts, suggesting evolutionary conservation.", '2017 Jul', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-017-2142-z', 'Kim']
