Because plant cells are glued to each other via their cell walls, failure to coordinate growth among adjacent cells can create cracks in tissues. Here, we find that the unbalanced growth of inner and outer tissues in the <i>clavata3 de-etiolated3</i> (<i>clv3 det3</i>) mutant of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> stretched epidermal cells, ultimately generating cracks in stems. Stem growth slowed before cracks appeared along <i>clv3 det3</i> stems, whereas inner pith cells became drastically distorted and accelerated their growth, yielding to stress, after the appearance of cracks. This is consistent with a key role of the epidermis in restricting growth. Mechanical property measurements recorded using an atomic force microscope revealed that epidermal cell wall stiffness decreased in <i>det3</i> and <i>clv3 det3</i> epidermises. Thus, we hypothesized that stem integrity depends on the epidermal resistance to mechanical stress. To formally test this hypothesis, we used the <i>DET3</i> gene as part of a tissue-specific strategy to complement cell expansion defects. Epidermis-driven DET3 expression restored growth and restored the frequency of stem cracking to 20% of the <i>clv3 det3</i> mutant, demonstrating the DET3-dependent load-bearing role of the epidermis.
