The P4 ATPase family in Arabidopsis consists of 12 members that encode putative aminophospholipid translocases (ALA1-12). Until recently, no mutations in these genes have been shown to cause a visible phenotype, although reduced expression of ALA1 in transgenic plants expressing an antisense construct has been shown to result in reduced plant size when plants were grown under cold conditions. During a genetic screen for mutations that affect trichome shape, we isolated several alleles of the irregular trichome branch 2 (itb2) mutation. Subsequent positional cloning of this locus showed that ITB2 encoded ALA3. Phenotypic and genetic analyses of multiple itb2 alleles, including the T-DNA insertion alleles, showed that the loss of ITB2/ALA3 function leads to aberrant trichome expansion, reduced primary root growth and longer root hairs. We also found that itb2/ala3 mutant pollen does not grow as well as wild-type pollen, leading to severe segregation distortion. Our results suggest that aminophospholipid translocases play an important role in the polar growth of plant cells, which is consistent with the proposed role of ALA3 in membrane trafficking. Furthermore, itb2/ala3 mutants provide a convenient visible phenotype for further genetic analysis of the ALA family in Arabidopsis.
