Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is a universal second messenger involved in various cellular processes, leading to plant development and to biotic and abiotic stress responses. Intracellular variation in free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is among the earliest events following the plant perception of environmental change. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> variations differ in their spatio-temporal properties according to the nature, strength and duration of the stimulus. However, their conversion into biological responses requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors for decoding and relaying. The occurrence in plants of calmodulin (CaM) but also of other sets of plant-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors such as calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs), Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) and calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) indicate that plants possess specific tools and machineries to convert Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals into appropriate responses. Here, we focus on recent progress made in monitoring the generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at the whole plant or cell level and their long distance propagation during biotic interactions. The contribution of CaM/CMLs and CDPKs in plant immune responses mounted against bacteria, fungi, viruses and insects are also presented.
