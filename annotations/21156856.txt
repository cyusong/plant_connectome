['21156856', 'Sorting nexins (SNXs) are conserved eukaryotic proteins that associate with three  types of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) proteins to form the retromer complex.  How SNXs act in this complex and whether they might work independently of the  retromer remains elusive. Here, we show by genetic and cell imaging approaches  that the Arabidopsis thaliana SNX1 protein recruits SNX2 at the endosomal  membrane, a process required for SNX1-SNX2 dimer activity. We report that, in  contrast with the mammalian retromer, SNXs are dispensable for membrane binding  and function of the retromer complex. We also show that VPS retromer components  can work with or independently of SNXs in the trafficking of seed storage  proteins, which reveals distinct functions for subcomplexes of the plant  retromer. Finally, we provide compelling evidence that the combined loss of  function of SNXs and VPS29 leads to embryo or seedling lethality, underlining the  essential role of these proteins in development.', '2010 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.078451', 'Gaude']
