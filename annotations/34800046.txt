Tillering is an important parameter of plant architecture in cereal crops. In this study, we identified the PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR-LIKE (PIL) family transcription factors as new repressors of tillering in cereal crops. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we explore the roles of TaPIL1 in regulating wheat plant architecture. We found that the PIL protein TaPIL1 controls tiller number in wheat. Overexpression of TaPIL1 reduces wheat tiller number; additionally, overexpression of TaPIL1-SUPERMAN repression domain increases wheat tiller number. Furthermore, we show that TaPIL1 activates the transcriptional expression of wheat TEOSINTE BRANCHED1 (TaTB1); moreover, TaPIL1 physically interacts with wheat SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (TaSPL)3/17, which are activators of TaTB1 transcription. In rice, overexpression and loss-of-function mutations of OsPIL11 reduce or increase tiller number by regulating the expression of OsTB1. In Arabidopsis, we demonstrate that PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 interacts with SPL9 to inhibit shoot branching. This study reveals that PIL family transcription factors directly interact with SPLs and play an important role in repressing tillering/branching in plants.
