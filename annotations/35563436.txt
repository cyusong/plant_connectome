Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) has been shown to participate in various stress responses in plants, including drought, salinity, extreme temperatures, osmotic stress, and heavy metal stress. Manganese (Mn), as a necessary nutrient for plant growth, plays an important role in photosynthesis, growth, development, and enzymatic activation of plants. However, excessive Mn<sup>2+</sup> in the soil can critically affect plant growth, particularly in acidic soil. In this study, the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> was used to explore the mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>S participation and alleviation of Mn stress. First, using wild-type <i>Arabidopsis</i> with excessive Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment, the following factors were increased: H<sub>2</sub>S content, the main H<sub>2</sub>S synthetase L-cysteine desulfhydrase enzyme (AtLCD) activity, and the expression level of the <i>AtLCD</i> gene. Further, using the wild-type, <i>AtLCD</i> deletion mutant (<i>lcd</i>) and overexpression lines (<i>OE5</i> and <i>OE32</i>) as materials, the phenotype of <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings was observed by exogenous application of hydrogen sulfide donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and scavenger hypotaurine (HT) under excessive Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment. The results showed that NaHS can significantly alleviate the stress caused by Mn<sup>2+</sup>, whereas HT aggravates this stress. The <i>lcd</i> mutant is more sensitive to Mn stress than the wild type, and the overexpression lines are more resistant. Moreover, the mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>S alleviating Mn stress was determined. The Mn<sup>2+</sup> content and the expression of the Mn transporter gene in the mutant were significantly higher than those of the wild-type and overexpression lines. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species was significantly reduced in NaHS-treated <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings and <i>AtLCD</i> overexpression lines, and the activities of various antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT, APX) also significantly increased. In summary, H<sub>2</sub>S is involved in the response of <i>Arabidopsis</i> to Mn stress and may alleviate the inhibition of Mn stress on <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedling growth by reducing Mn<sup>2+</sup> content, reducing reactive oxygen species content, and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity. This study provides an important basis for further study of plant resistance to heavy metal stress.
