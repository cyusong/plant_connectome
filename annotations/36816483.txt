The potassium transporter group of the <i>HAK/KUP/KT</i> (high-affinity K<sup>+</sup>)/<i>KUP</i> (K<sup>+</sup> uptake)/<i>KT</i> (K<sup>+</sup> transporter) family plays a crucial role in plant growth and development as well as in environmental adaptation such as tolerance to salt stress. HAK/KUP/KT genes and their functions have been characterized for a number of plant species, but they remain unknown for <i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i>, an important tree species for coastal protection in southern China and many other countries. In this study, 25 <i>HAK</i> genes were identified in the <i>C. equisetifolia</i> genome. Their gene structure, conserved motif, phylogeny, and expression were comprehensively and systematically analyzed to understand their functions. All <i>HAK</i> genes were relatively conserved and could be divided into four clusters. The expression level of two particular genes, <i>CeqHAK11</i> and <i>CeqHAK6</i>, increased significantly with the duration of salt treatment. To further elucidated their function in response to salt stress, subcellular localization, and their functional analysis were developed. Results revealed that <i>CeqHAK11</i> and <i>CeqHAK6</i> were localized on the plasma membrane, which mainly mediated high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> uptake. Overexpression of <i>CeqHAK6</i> or <i>CeqHAK11</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> showed higher germination and survival rates and longer root length than wild-type (WT) under salt stress, suggesting that both genes improve tolerance to salt stress. Moreover, <i>CeqHAK6</i> and <i>CeqHAK11</i> improved their ability to tolerate salt stress by increasing the K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio and antioxidant enzyme activities (CAT, POD, and SOD), and decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Consequently, <i>CeqHAK6</i> and <i>CeqHAK11</i> were verified as potassium transport proteins and could be applied for further molecular breeding for salt tolerance in <i>C. equisetifolia</i> or other crops to increasing salt tolerance.
