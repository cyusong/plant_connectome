DNA methylation is a conserved and important epigenetic modification involved in the regulation of numerous biological processes, including plant development, secondary metabolism, and response to stresses. However, no information is available regarding the identification of cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferase (C5-MTase) and DNA demethylase (dMTase) genes in the orchid Dendrobium officinale. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DoC5-MTase and DodMTase gene families in D. officinale. Integrated analysis of conserved motifs, gene structures and phylogenetic analysis showed that eight DoC5-MTases were divided into four subfamilies (DoCMT, DoDNMT, DoDRM, DoMET) while three DodMTases were divided into two subfamilies (DoDML3, DoROS1). Multiple cis-acting elements, especially stress-responsive and hormone-responsive ones, were found in the promoter region of DoC5-MTase and DodMTase genes. Furthermore, we investigated the expression profiles of DoC5-MTase and DodMTase in 10 different tissues, as well as their transcript abundance under abiotic stresses (cold and drought) and at the seedling stage, in protocorm-like bodies, shoots, and plantlets. Interestingly, most DoC5-MTases were downregulated whereas DodMTases were upregulated by cold stress. At the seedling stage, DoC5-MTase expression decreased as growth proceeded, but DodMTase expression increased. These results provide a basis for elucidating the role of DoC5-MTase and DodMTase in secondary metabolite production and responses to abiotic stresses in D. officinale.
