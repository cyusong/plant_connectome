['24267661', 'Arabidopsis proton gradient regulation (pgr) mutants have high chlorophyll  fluorescence and reduced non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) caused by defects in  photosynthetic electron transport. Here, we identify PGR6 as the chloroplast  lipid droplet (plastoglobule, PG) kinase ABC1K1 (activity of bc1 complex kinase  1). The members of the ABC1/ADCK/UbiB family of atypical kinases regulate  ubiquinone synthesis in bacteria and mitochondria, and impact various metabolic  pathways in plant chloroplasts. Here, we demonstrate that abc1k1 has a unique  photosynthetic and metabolic phenotype that is distinct from that of the abc1k3  homolog. The abc1k1/pgr6 single mutant is specifically deficient in the electron  carrier plastoquinone, as well as in beta-carotene and the xanthophyll lutein, and  is defective in membrane antioxidant tocopherol metabolism. After 2 days of  continuous high light stress, abc1k1/pgr6 plants suffer extensive photosynthetic  and metabolic perturbations, strongly affecting carbohydrate metabolism.  Remarkably, however, the mutant acclimates to high light after 7 days together  with a recovery of carotenoid levels and a drastic alteration in the  starch-to-sucrose ratio. Moreover, ABC1K1 behaves as an active kinase and  phosphorylates VTE1, a key enzyme of tocopherol (vitamin E) metabolism in vitro.  Our results indicate that the ABC1K1 kinase constitutes a new type of regulatory  link between photosynthetic activity and chloroplast metabolism.', '2014 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12385', 'Kessler']
