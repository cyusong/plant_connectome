Mitochondrial respiratory components participate in the maintenance of chloroplast functional activity. This study investigates the effects 48h de-etiolation of spring wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum L., var. Irgina) on the expression of genes that encode energy-dissipating respiratory components and antioxidant enzymes under continuous light conditions. The expression of AOX1a following the prolonged darkness exhibited a pattern indicating a prominent dependence on light. The expression of other respiratory genes, including NDA2, NDB2, and UCP1b, increased during de-etiolation and dark-to-light transition; however, changes in the expression of these genes occurred later than those in AOX1a expression. A high expression of NDA1 was detected after 12h of de-etiolation. The suppression of AOX1a, NDA2, NDB2, and UCP1b was observed 24h after de-etiolation when the photosynthetic apparatus and its defence systems against excess light were completely developed. The expression patterns of the respiratory genes and several genes encoding antioxidant enzymes (MnSOD, Cu-ZnSOD, t-APX, GR, and GRX) were quite similar. Our data indicate that the induction of nuclear genes encoding respiratory and antioxidant enzymes allow the plants to control reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and avoid oxidative stress during de-etiolation.
