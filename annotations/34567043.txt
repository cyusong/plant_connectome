Powdery mildew is one of the most important fungal pathogen diseases. The genome of barley mildew fungus, <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i> (<i>Bgh</i>), encodes a large number of candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs). So far, the function and mechanism of most CSEPs remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a <i>Bgh</i> effector CSEP0027, a member of family 41, triggering cell death in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. CSEP0027 contains a functional signal peptide (SP), verified by yeast secretion assay. We show that CSEP0027 promotes <i>Bgh</i> virulence in barley infection using transient gene expression and host-induced gene silencing (HIGS). Barley catalase <i>Hv</i>CAT1 is identified as a CSEP0027 interactor by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening, and the interaction is verified in yeast, in <i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The coexpression of CSEP0027 and <i>Hv</i>CAT1 in barley cells results in altered localization of <i>Hv</i>CAT1 from the peroxisome to the nucleus. Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-silencing and transiently-induced gene silencing (TIGS) assays reveal that <i>Hv</i>CAT1 is required for barley immunity against <i>Bgh</i>. We propose that CSEP0027 interacts with barley <i>Hv</i>CAT1 to regulate the host immunity and likely reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis to promote fungal virulence during barley infection.
