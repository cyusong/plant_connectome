['23857348', "AtALMT1 (Arabidopsis thaliana ALuminum activated Malate Transporter 1) encodes an  Arabidopsis thaliana malate transporter that has a pleiotropic role in  Arabidopsis stress tolerance. Malate released through AtALMT1 protects the root  tip from Al rhizotoxicity, and recruits beneficial rhizobacteria that induce  plant immunity. To examine whether the overexpression of AtALMT1 can improve  these traits, the gene, driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, was  introduced into the Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia. Overexpression of the gene  enhanced both Al-activated malate excretion and the recruitment of beneficial  bacteria Bacillus subtilis strain FB17. These findings suggest that  overexpression of AtALMT1 can be used as an approach to enhance a plant's ability  to release malate into the rhizosphere, which can enhance plant tolerance to some  environmental stress factors.", '2013 Sep', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.25565', 'Koyama']
