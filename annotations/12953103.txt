['12953103', 'During plant development, the final size of an organ is regulated and determined  by various developmental signals; however, the molecular mechanisms by which  these signals are transduced and the mediators involved are largely unknown.  Here, we show that ARGOS, a novel Arabidopsis gene that is highly induced by  auxin, is involved in organ size control. Transgenic plants expressing sense or  antisense ARGOS cDNA display enlarged or reduced aerial organs, respectively. The  alteration in organ size is attributable mainly to changes in cell number and the  duration of organ growth. Ectopic expression of ARGOS prolongs the expression of  AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) and CycD3;1 as well as the neoplastic activity of leaf cells.  Moreover, organ enlargement in plants overexpressing ARGOS can be blocked by the  loss of function of ANT, implying that ARGOS functions upstream of ANT to affect  the meristematic competence of organ cells. The induction of ARGOS by auxin is  attenuated or abolished in auxin-resistant1 (axr1), and overexpression of ARGOS  partially restores axr1 organ development. These results suggest that ARGOS may  transduce auxin signals downstream of AXR1 to regulate cell proliferation and  organ growth through ANT during organogenesis.', '2003 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.013557', 'Chua']
