Many seed plants produce winged diaspores that use wind to disperse their seeds. The morphology of these diaspores is directly related to the seed dispersal potential. The majority of winged diaspores have flat wings and only seeds; however, some angiosperms, such as Firmiana produce winged fruit with a different morphology, whose seed dispersal mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this study, we observed the fruit development of F. simplex and determined the morphological characteristics of mature fruit and their effects on the flight performance of the fruit. We found that the pericarp of F. simplex dehisced early and continued to unfold and expand during fruit development until ripening, finally formed a spoon-shaped wing with multiple alternate seeds on each edge. The wing caused mature fruit to spin stably during descent to provide a low terminal velocity, which was correlated with the wing loading and the distribution of seeds on the pericarp. When the curvature distribution of the pericarp surface substantially changed, the aerodynamic characteristics of fruit during descent altered, resulting in the inability of the fruit to spin. Our results suggest that the curved shape and alternate seed distribution are necessary for the winged diaspore of F. simplex to stabilize spinning during wind dispersal. These unique morphological characteristics are related to the early cracking of fruits during development, which may be an adaptation for the wind dispersal of seeds.
