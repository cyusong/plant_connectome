['34850203', 'AGAMOUS-Like 18 (AGL18) is a MADS domain transcription factor (TF) that is  structurally related to AGL15. Here we show that, like AGL15, AGL18 can promote  somatic embryogenesis (SE) when ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana). Based on loss-of-function mutants, AGL15 and AGL18 have redundant  functions in developmental processes such as SE. To understand the nature of this  redundancy, we undertook a number of studies to look at the interaction between  these factors. We studied the genome-wide direct targets of AGL18 to characterize  its roles at the molecular level using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-SEQ  combined with RNA-SEQ. The results demonstrated that AGL18 binds to thousands of  sites in the genome. Comparison of ChIP-SEQ data for AGL15 and AGL18 revealed  substantial numbers of genes bound by both AGL15 and AGL18, but there were also  differences. Gene ontology analysis revealed that target genes were enriched for  seed, embryo, and reproductive development as well as hormone and stress  responses. The results also demonstrated that AGL15 and AGL18 interact in a  complex regulatory loop, where AGL15 inhibited transcript accumulation of AGL18,  while AGL18 increased AGL15 transcript accumulation. Co-immunoprecipitation  revealed an interaction between AGL18 and AGL15 in somatic embryo tissue. The  binding and expression analyses revealed a complex crosstalk and interactions  among embryo TFs and their target genes. In addition, our study also revealed  that phosphorylation of AGL18 and AGL15 was crucial for the promotion of SE.', '2022 Mar 4', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiab553', 'ORCID:']
