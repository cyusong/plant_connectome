A modern method of therapeutic use of natural compounds that would protect the body are jasmonates. The main representatives of jasmonate compounds include jasmonic acid and its derivatives, mainly methyl jasmonate. Extracts from plants rich in jasmonic compounds show a broad spectrum of activity, i.e., anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and cosmetic. Studies of the biological activity of jasmonic acid and its derivatives in mammals are based on their structural similarity to prostaglandins and the compounds can be used as natural therapeutics for inflammation. Jasmonates also constitute a potential group of anti-cancer drugs that can be used alone or in combination with other known chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover, due to their ability to stimulate exfoliation of the epidermis, remove discoloration, regulate the function of the sebaceous glands and reduce the visible signs of aging, they are considered for possible use in cosmetics and dermatology. The paper presents a review of literature data on the biological activity of jasmonates that may be helpful in treatment and prevention.
