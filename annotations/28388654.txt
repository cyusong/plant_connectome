Copper ions play an important role in ethylene receptor biogenesis and proper function. The copper transporter RESPONSIVE-TO-ANTAGONIST1 (RAN1) is essential for copper ion transport in Arabidopsis thaliana. However it is still unclear how copper ions are delivered to RAN1 and how copper ions affect ethylene receptors. There is not a specific copper chelator which could be used to explore these questions. Here, by chemical genetics, we identified a novel small molecule, triplin, which could cause a triple response phenotype on dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings through ethylene signaling pathway. ran1-1 and ran1-2 are hypersensitive to triplin. Adding copper ions in growth medium could partially restore the phenotype on plant caused by triplin. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that triplin could bind copper ion. Compared to the known chelators, triplin acts more specifically to copper ion and it suppresses the toxic effects of excess copper ions on plant root growth. We further showed that mutants of ANTIOXIDANT PROTEIN1 (ATX1) are hypersensitive to tiplin, but with less sensitivity comparing with the ones of ran1-1 and ran1-2. Our study provided genetic evidence for the first time that, copper ions necessary for ethylene receptor biogenesis and signaling are transported from ATX1 to RAN1. Considering that triplin could chelate copper ions in Arabidopsis, and copper ions are essential for plant and animal, we believe that, triplin not only could be useful for studying copper ion transport of plants, but also could be useful for copper metabolism study in animal and human.
