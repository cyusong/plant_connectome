['25788731', 'The mycotoxin fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a strong inducer of programmed cell death  (PCD) in plants, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we describe  two ubiquitin ligases, RING DOMAIN LIGASE3 (RGLG3) and RGLG4, which control  FB1-triggered PCD by modulating the jasmonate (JA) signalling pathway in  Arabidopsis thaliana. RGLG3 and RGLG4 transcription was sensitive to FB1.  Arabidopsis FB1 sensitivity was suppressed by loss of function of RGLG3 and RGLG4  and was increased by their overexpression. Thus RGLG3 and RGLG4 have coordinated  and positive roles in FB1-elicited PCD. Mutated JA perception by coi1 disrupted  the RGLG3- and RGLG4-related response to FB1 and interfered with their roles in  cell death. Although FB1 induced JA-responsive defence genes, it repressed  growth-related, as well as JA biosynthesis-related, genes. Consistently, FB1  application reduced JA content in wild-type plants. Furthermore, exogenously  applied salicylic acid additively suppressed JA signalling with FB1 treatment,  suggesting that FB1-induced salicylic acid inhibits the JA pathway during this  process. All of these effects were attenuated in rglg3 rglg4 plants. Altogether,  these data suggest that the JA pathway is hijacked by the toxin FB1 to elicit  PCD, which is coordinated by Arabidopsis RGLG3 and RGLG4.', '2015 May', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erv068', 'An']
