['11402161', 'Many aspects of plant development are regulated by photoreceptor function and the  circadian clock. Loss-of-function mutations in the Arabidopsis EARLY FLOWERING 3  (ELF3) and PHYTOCHROME B (PHYB) genes cause early flowering and influence the  activity of circadian clock-regulated processes. We demonstrate here that the  relative abundance of the ELF3 protein, which is a novel nucleus-localized  protein, displays circadian regulation that follows the pattern of circadian  accumulation of ELF3 transcript. Furthermore, the ELF3 protein interacts with  PHYB in the yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro. Genetic analyses show that ELF3  requires PHYB function in early morphogenesis but not for the regulation of  flowering time. This suggests that ELF3 is a component of a PHYB signaling  complex that controls early events in plant development but that ELF3 and PHYB  control flowering via independent signal transduction pathways.', '2001 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.13.6.1293', 'Wagner']
