Small molecules, such as peptides and miRNAs, are crucial regulators of plant growth. Here, we show the importance of cross-talk between miPEP858a (microRNA858a-encoded peptide)/miR858a and phytosulfokine (PSK4) in regulating plant growth and development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Genome-wide expression analysis suggested modulated expression of PSK4 in miR858a mutants and miR858a-overexpressing (miR858aOX) plants. The silencing of PSK4 in miR858aOX plants compromised growth, whereas overexpression of PSK4 in the miR858a mutant rescued the developmental defects. The exogenous application of synthetic PSK4 further complemented the plant development in mutant plants. Exogenous treatment of synthetic miPEP858a in the PSK4 mutant led to clathrin-mediated internalization of the peptide; however, it did not enhance growth as is the case in wild-type plants. We also demonstrated that MYB3 is an important molecular component participating in the miPEP858a/miR858a-PSK4 module. Finally, our work highlights the signaling between miR858a/miPEP858a-MYB3-PSK4 in modulating the expression of key elements involved in auxin responses, leading to the regulation of growth.
