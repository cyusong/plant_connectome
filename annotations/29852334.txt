The anticancer compound podophyllotoxin and other related lignans can be produced in Linum album in vitro cultures, although their biosynthesis varies according to the degree of differentiation of the plant material. In general, L. album cell cultures do not form the same lignans as roots or other culture systems. Our aim was to explore how the lignan-producing capacity of organogenic cell masses is affected by the conditions that promote their formation and growth. Thus, L. album biomass obtained from plantlets was cultured in darkness or light, with or without the addition of plant growth regulators, and the levels of podophyllotoxin, methoxypodophyllotoxin and other related lignans were determined in each of these conditions. The organogenic capacity of the cell biomass grown in the different conditions was studied directly and also with light and scanning electronic microscopy, leading to the observation of.several somatic embryos and well-formed shoots. The main lignan produced was methoxypodophyllotoxin, whose production was clearly linked to the organogenic capacity of the cell biomass, which to a lesser extent was also the case for podophyllotoxin.
