['15108305', 'The transition from leaf cells to protoplasts (plant cells devoid of cell walls)  confers pluripotentiality coupled with chromatin reorganization. Here, we sought  to identify remodeled chromosomal domains in Arabidopsis protoplasts by tracking  DNA sequences undergoing changes in DNA methylation and by identifying  up-regulated genes. We observed a reduction in DNA methylation at a  pericentromeric region of chromosome 1, and up-regulation of several members of  the NAC (NAM/ATAF1/CUC2) domain family, two of which are located near the  telomeric region of chromosome 1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)  analysis demonstrated that both pericentromeric and telomeric subdomains  underwent chromatin decondensation. This decondensation is subdomain-specific  inasmuch as centromeric repeats remained largely unchanged, whereas the 18S rDNA  underwent condensation. Within the pericentromeric subdomain, VIP1, a gene  encoding a b-Zip nuclear protein required for Agrobacterium infectivity, was  transcriptionally activated. Overexpression of this gene in tobacco resulted in  growth retardation and inhibition of differentiation and shoot formation.  Altogether, our data indicate that acquisition of pluripotentiality involves  changes in DNA methylation pattern and reorganization of specific chromosomal  subdomains. This change leads to activation of silent genes whose products are  involved in acquisition or maintenance of pluripotentiality and/or the ensuing  fate of the cell.', '2004 May', 'Dev Dyn', '10.1002/dvdy.20006', 'Grafi']
