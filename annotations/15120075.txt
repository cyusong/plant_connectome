['15120075', 'The transition from vegetative to reproductive development establishes new growth  patterns required for flowering. This switch is controlled by environmental  and/or intrinsic developmental cues that converge at the shoot apical meristem  (SAM). During this developmental transition, floral inductive signals cause the  vegetative meristem to undergo morphological changes that are essential for  flowering. Arabidopsis plants containing null mutations in two paralogous  BEL1-like (BELL) homeobox genes, PENNYWISE (PNY) and POUND-FOOLISH (PNF), disrupt  the transition from vegetative to reproductive development. These double mutants  are completely unable to flower even though the SAM displays morphological and  molecular changes that are consistent with having received floral inductive  signals. These studies establish a link between the competence to receive floral  inductive signals and restructuring of the SAM during floral evocation.', '2004 May 4', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2004.04.032', 'Hake']
