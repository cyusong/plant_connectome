Adventitious root formation is a process in which roots are induced, from determined or differentiated cells that have not been specified to develop a root, at positions where they do not normally occur during development. In forest tree species, a decline in the capacity to form adventitious roots from similar cell types in stem cuttings is associated with tree age and maturity. This decline limits the success of vegetative propagation of selected adult trees. The joint action of local signals and a dynamic cascade of regulatory changes in gene expression, resulting in stereotypical cell division patterns, regulate cell fate changes that enable a somatic differentiated cell to reactivate meristem programs toward the induction of an adventitious root meristem.
