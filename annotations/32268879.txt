Plant Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters (NHXs) are membrane-localized proteins that maintain cellular Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> and pH homeostasis. Considerable evidence highlighted the critical roles of NHX family in plant development and salt response; however, NHXs in cotton are rarely studied. The comprehensive and systematic comparative study of NHXs in three Gossypium species was performed. We identified 12, 12, and 23 putative NHX proteins from G. arboreum, G. raimondii, and G. hirsutum, respectively. Phylogenetic study revealed that repeated polyploidization of Gossypium spp. contributed to the expansion of NHX family. Gene structure analysis showed that cotton NHXs contain many introns, which will lead to alternative splicing and help plants to adapt to high salt concentrations in soil. The expression changes of NHXs indicate the possible differences in the roles of distinct NHXs in salt response. GhNHX1 was proved to be located in the vacuolar system and intensively induced by salt stress in cotton. Silencing of GhNHX1 resulted in enhanced sensitivity of cotton seedlings to high salt concentrations, which suggests that GhNHX1 positively regulates cotton tolerance to salt stress. We characterized the gene structure, phylogenetic relationship, chromosomal location, and expression pattern of NHX genes from G. arboreum, G. raimondii, and G. hirsutum. Our findings indicated that the cotton NHX genes are regulated meticulously and differently at the transcription level with possible alternative splicing. The tolerance of plants to salt stress may rely on the expression level of a particular NHX, rather than the number of NHXs in the genome. This study could provide significant insights into the function of plant NHXs, as well as propose promising candidate genes for breeding salt-resistant cotton cultivars.
