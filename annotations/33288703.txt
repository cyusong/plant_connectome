In plant cells, cortical microtubules (CMTs) generally control morphogenesis by guiding cellulose synthesis. CMT alignment has been proposed to depend on geometrical cues, with microtubules aligning with the cell long axis in silico and in vitro. Yet, CMTs are usually transverse in vivo, i.e., along predicted maximal tension, which is transverse for cylindrical pressurized vessels. Here, we adapted a microwell setup to test these predictions in a single-cell system. We confined protoplasts laterally to impose a curvature ratio and modulated pressurization through osmotic changes. We find that CMTs can be longitudinal or transverse in wallless protoplasts and that the switch in CMT orientation depends on pressurization. In particular, longitudinal CMTs become transverse when cortical tension increases. This explains the dual behavior of CMTs in planta: CMTs become longitudinal when stress levels become low, while stable transverse CMT alignments in tissues result from their autonomous response to tensile stress fluctuations.
