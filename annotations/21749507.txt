Genomic approaches have generated large Arabidopsis open reading frame (ORF) collections. However, molecular tools are required to characterize this ORFeome functionally. A high-throughput microtiter plate-based protoplast transactivation (PTA) system has been established that can be used in a screening approach to define which transcription factor (TF) regulates a given promoter in planta. Using to this procedure, the transactivation properties of 96 TFs can be analyzed rapidly, making use of promoter:Luciferase (LUC)-reporters and luciferase imaging. Applying GATEWAY® technology, we have established a platform to assay more than 700 Arabidopsis TFs. As a proof-of-principle, the ethylene response factor (ERF) family has been studied to evaluate this system. Importantly, distinct subsets of related ERF factors were found to activate specifically the well described target promoters RD29A and PDF1.2 that are under control of DRE or GCC box cis-elements, respectively. Furthermore, several applications of the PTA system have been demonstrated, such as analysis of transcriptional repressors, salt-inducible gene expression or functional interaction of signaling molecules like kinases and TFs. This novel molecular tool will improve functional studies on transcriptional regulation in plants significantly.
