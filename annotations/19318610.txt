['19318610', 'In plants and animals, induced resistance (IR) to biotic and abiotic stress is  associated with priming of cells for faster and stronger activation of defense  responses. It has been hypothesized that cell priming involves accumulation of  latent signaling components that are not used until challenge exposure to stress.  However, the identity of such signaling components has remained elusive. Here, we  show that during development of chemically induced resistance in Arabidopsis  thaliana, priming is associated with accumulation of mRNA and inactive proteins  of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), MPK3 and MPK6. Upon challenge  exposure to biotic or abiotic stress, these two enzymes were more strongly  activated in primed plants than in nonprimed plants. This elevated activation was  linked to enhanced defense gene expression and development of IR. Strong  elicitation of stress-induced MPK3 and MPK6 activity is also seen in the  constitutive priming mutant edr1, while activity was attenuated in the  priming-deficient npr1 mutant. Moreover, priming of defense gene expression and  IR were lost or reduced in mpk3 or mpk6 mutants. Our findings argue that  prestress deposition of the signaling components MPK3 and MPK6 is a critical step  in priming plants for full induction of defense responses during IR.', '2009 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.062158', 'Conrath']
