['32499110', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important plant hormone that mediates abiotic stresses  in plant growth and development. A number of E3 ligases have been reported to be  involved in ABA signaling pathway. In this study, we identified a C3H2C3  RING-type E3 ligase, Arabidopsis thaliana Tomicronxicos en Levadura 61 (ATL61), which  regulated drought stress in planta. Enzyme assay in vitro demonstrated that ATL61  had E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, while point mutation of ATL61(H109A, H122A)  (mATL61) abolished its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. ATL61 overexpression plants  exhibited ABA hypersensitivity and were more tolerant to drought, while the atl61  mutant plants were insensitive to ABA. Moreover, mATL61 overexpression lines  exhibited similar ABA-related phenotypes with wild type (WT) plants. The  transcript abundances of ABA-mediated drought stress-related genes RD20 and RD22  were higher in ATL61 overexpression plants than those in WT, atl61, and mATL61  plants. Our results indicated that ATL61 acted as a positive regulator in the  ABA-mediated drought stress response.', '2020 Jul 23', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.067', 'Yang']
