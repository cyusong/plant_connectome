['17332757', 'Argonautes (AGOs) are conserved proteins that contain an RNA-binding PAZ domain  and an RNase H-like PIWI domain. In Arabidopsis, except for AGO1, AGO4 and AGO7,  the roles of seven other AGOs in gene silencing are not known. We found that a  mutation in AGO6 partially suppresses transcriptional gene silencing in the DNA  demethylase mutant ros1-1. In ago6-1ros1-1 plants, RD29A promoter short  interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are less abundant, and cytosine methylation at both  transgenic and endogenous RD29A promoters is reduced, compared to that in ros1-1.  Interestingly, the ago4-1 mutation has a stronger suppression of the  transcriptional silencing phenotype of ros1-1 mutant. Analysis of cytosine  methylation at the endogenous MEA-ISR, AtREP2 and SIMPLEHAT2 loci revealed that  the CpNpG and asymmetric methylation levels are lower in either of the ago6-1 and  ago4-1 single mutants than those in the wild type, and the levels are the lowest  in the ago6-1ago4-1 double mutant. These results suggest that AGO6 is important  for the accumulation of specific heterochromatin-related siRNAs, and for DNA  methylation and transcriptional gene silencing, this function is partly redundant  with AGO4.', '2007 Mar 21', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7601603', 'Zhu']
