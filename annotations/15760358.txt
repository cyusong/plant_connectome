Here we examined species differences in perception and response to two distinct types of shade cue, reduced photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) with and without reduced red : far red ratio (R : FR), in Polygonum persicaria and Polygonum hydropiper, two closely related annuals of contrasting ecological breadth. We compared plasticity data for light-gathering traits from glasshouse experiments at equivalently reduced PAR under neutral shade (R : FR 1.03) and green shade (R : FR 0.702). Species shared the ability to distinguish between the two types of shade, as shown by the ability of each to respond differently to neutral vs green shade for one or more traits. However, the species' responses to these cues differed significantly. Polygonum persicaria expressed stronger shade-tolerance responses (increased leaf allocation and leaf area ratio) to reduced PAR alone than to green shade. By contrast, P. hydropiper expressed slightly less plasticity for these traits in neutral than in green shade. The pronounced plastic response of P. persicaria to neutral shade may contribute to the range of habitats this widespread species can occupy, which includes neutral-shade environments such as urban settings.
