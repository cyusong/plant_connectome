High soil salinity negatively affects plant growth and development, leading to a severe decrease in crop production worldwide. Here, we report that a secreted peptide, PAMP-INDUCED SECRETED PEPTIDE 3 (PIP3), plays an essential role in plant salt tolerance through RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 7 (RLK7) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The gene encoding the PIP3 precursor, prePIP3, was significantly induced by salt stress. Plants overexpressing prePIP3 exhibited enhanced salt tolerance, whereas a prePIP3 knockout mutant had a salt-sensitive phenotype. PIP3 physically interacted with RLK7, a leucine-rich repeat RLK, and salt stress enhanced PIP3-RLK7 complex formation. Functional analyses revealed that PIP3-mediated salt tolerance is dependent on RLK7. Exogenous application of synthetic PIP3 peptide activated RLK7, and salt treatment significantly induced RLK7 phosphorylation in a PIP3-dependent manner. Notably, MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6 were downstream of the PIP3-RLK7 module in salt response signaling. Activation of MPK3/6 was attenuated in pip3 or rlk7 mutants under saline conditions. Therefore, MPK3/6 might amplify salt stress response signaling in plants for salt tolerance. Collectively, our work characterized a novel ligand-receptor signaling cascade that modulates plant salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. This study contributes to our understanding of how plants respond to salt stress.
