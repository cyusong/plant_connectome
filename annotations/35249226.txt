Mosses have been found outliers of the trade-off between photosynthesis and bulk elastic modulus described for vascular plants. Hence, potential trade-offs among physical features of cell walls and desiccation tolerance, water relations, and photosynthesis were assessed in bryophytes and other poikilohydric species. Long-term desiccation tolerance was quantified after variable periods of desiccation/rehydration cycles. Water relations were analyzed by pressure-volume curves. Mesophyll conductance was estimated using both CO<sub>2</sub> curve-fitting and anatomical methods. Cell wall elasticity was the parameter that better correlated with the desiccation tolerance index for desiccation tolerant species and was antagonistic to higher absolute values of osmotic potential. Although high values of cell wall effective porosity were estimated compared with the values assumed for vascular plants, the desiccation tolerance index negatively correlated with the porosity in desiccation tolerant bryophytes. Neither cell wall thickness nor photosynthetic capacity were correlated with the desiccation tolerance index of the studied species. The existence of a potential evolutionary trade-off between cell wall thickness and desiccation tolerance is rejected. The photosynthetic capacity reported for bryophytes is independent of elasticity and desiccation tolerance. Furthermore, the role of cell wall thickness in limiting CO<sub>2</sub> conductance would be overestimated under a scenario of high cell wall porosity for most bryophytes.
