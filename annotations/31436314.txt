Oomycete pathogens secrete numerous effectors to manipulate host immunity. While some effectors share a conserved structural fold, it remains unclear if any have conserved host targets. Avr3a-like family effectors, which are related to Phytophthora infestans effector PiAvr3a and are widely distributed across diverse clades of Phytophthora species, were used to study this question. By using yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we identified members of the plant cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 7 (CAD7) subfamily as targets of multiple Avr3a-like effectors from Phytophthora pathogens. The CAD7 subfamily has expanded in plant genomes but lost the lignin biosynthetic activity of canonical CAD subfamilies. In turn, we identified CAD7s as negative regulators of plant immunity that are induced by Phytophthora infection. Moreover, AtCAD7 was stabilized by Avr3a-like effectors and involved in suppression of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity, including callose deposition, reactive oxygen species burst and WRKY33 expression. Our results reveal CAD7 subfamily proteins as negative regulators of plant immunity that are exploited by multiple Avr3a-like effectors to promote infection in different host plants.
