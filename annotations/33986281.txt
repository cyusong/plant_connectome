['33986281', 'Transgenes that are stably expressed in plant genomes over many generations could  be assumed to behave epigenetically the same as endogenous genes. Here, we report  that whereas the histone H3K9me2 demethylase IBM1, but not the histone H3K4me3  demethylase JMJ14, counteracts DNA methylation of Arabidopsis endogenous genes,  JMJ14, but not IBM1, counteracts DNA methylation of expressed transgenes.  Additionally, JMJ14-mediated specific attenuation of transgene DNA methylation  enhances the production of aberrant RNAs that readily induce systemic  post-transcriptional transgene silencing (PTGS). Thus, the JMJ14 chromatin  modifying complex maintains expressed transgenes in a probationary state of  susceptibility to PTGS, suggesting that the host plant genome does not  immediately accept expressed transgenes as being epigenetically the same as  endogenous genes.', '2021 May 13', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-021-22995-3', 'Vaucheret']
