The 'canalization hypothesis' was suggested 50 years ago by Tsvi Sachs to account for the formation of vascular strands in response to wounding or auxin application. The hypothesis proposes that positive feedback between auxin movement through a cell and the cell's auxin conductivity leads to the gradual selection of narrow 'canals' of polar auxin transport that will differentiate into vascular strands. Though the hypothesis has provided an invaluable conceptual framework to understand the patterned formation of vascular strands, evidence has been accumulating that seems to be incompatible with the hypothesis. We suggest that the challenging evidence is incompatible with current interpretations of the hypothesis but not with the concept at the core of the hypothesis' original formulation.
