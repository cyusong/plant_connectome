Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a gaseous signaling molecule that regulates diverse cellular signaling pathways through persulfidation, which involves the post-translational modification of specific Cys residues to form persulfides. However, the mechanisms that underlie this important redox-based modification remain poorly understood in higher plants. We have, therefore, analyzed how protein persulfidation acts as a specific and reversible signaling mechanism during the abscisic acid (ABA) response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here we show that ABA stimulates the persulfidation of l-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE1, an important endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S enzyme, at Cys44 and Cys205 in a redox-dependent manner. Moreover, sustainable H<sub>2</sub>S accumulation drives persulfidation of the NADPH oxidase RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG PROTEIN D (RBOHD) at Cys825 and Cys890, enhancing its ability to produce reactive oxygen species. Physiologically, s-persulfidation-induced RBOHD activity is relevant to ABA-induced stomatal closure. Together, these processes form a negative feedback loop that fine-tunes guard cell redox homeostasis and ABA signaling. These findings not only expand our current knowledge of H<sub>2</sub>S function in the context of guard cell ABA signaling, but also demonstrate the presence of a rapid signal integration mechanism involving specific and reversible redox-based post-translational modifications that occur in response to changing environmental conditions.
