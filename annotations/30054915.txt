Abiotic stresses affect crop plants and cause decreases in plant quality and productivity. Plants can overcome environmental stresses by activating molecular networks, including signal transduction, stress perception, metabolite production and expressions of specific stress-related genes. Recent research suggests that chemical priming is a promising field in crop stress management because plants can be primed by chemical agents to increase their tolerance to various environmental stresses. We present a concept to meet this objective and protect plants through priming of existing defense mechanisms avoiding manipulation of the genome. In addition, recent developments in plant molecular biology include the discovery of genes related to stress tolerance, including functional genes for protecting cells and regulatory genes for regulating stress responses. Therefore, enhancing abiotic stress tolerance using a transgenic approach to transfer these genes into plant genomes has attracted more investigations. Both chemical priming agents and genetic engineering can enhance regulatory and functional genes in plants and increase stress tolerance of plants. This review summarizes the latest findings of chemical priming agents and major achievements in molecular approaches that can potentially enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of plants.
