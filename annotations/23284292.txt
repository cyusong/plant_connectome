['23284292', 'Tri-methylated H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is associated with transcriptionally active  genes, but its function in the transcription process is still unclear. Point  mutations in the catalytic domain of ATX1 (ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX1), a H3K4  methyltransferase, and RNAi knockdowns of subunits of the AtCOMPASS-like  (Arabidopsis Complex Proteins Associated with Set) were used to address this  question. We demonstrate that both ATX1 and AtCOMPASS-like are required for high  level accumulation of TBP (TATA-binding protein) and Pol II at promoters and that  this requirement is independent of the catalytic histone modifying activity.  However, the catalytic function is critically required for transcription as  H3K4me3 levels determine the efficiency of transcription elongation. The roles of  H3K4me3, ATX1, and AtCOMPASS-like may be of a general relevance for transcription  of Trithorax-activated eukaryotic genes.', '2012', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1003111', 'Avramova']
