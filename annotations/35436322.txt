Studies investigating the mechanisms underlying the variation of photosynthesis along plant phylogeny and especially during domestication are of great importance, and may provide new insights to further improve crop photosynthesis. In the present study, we compiled a database including 542 sets of data of leaf gas exchange parameters and leaf structural and chemical traits in ferns and fern allies, gymnosperms, non-crop angiosperms, and crops. We found that photosynthesis was dramatically improved from ferns and fern allies to non-crop angiosperms, and further increased in crops. The improvement of photosynthesis during phylogeny and domestication was related to increases in carbon dioxide diffusional capacities and, to a lesser extent, biochemical capacity. Cell wall thickness rather than chloroplast surface area facing intercellular airspaces drives the variation of mesophyll conductance. The variation of the maximum carboxylation rate was not related to leaf nitrogen content. The slope of the relationship between mass-based photosynthesis and nitrogen was lower in crops than in non-crop angiosperms. These findings suggest that the manipulation of cell wall thickness is the most promising approach to further improve crop photosynthesis, and that an increase of leaf nitrogen will be less efficient in improving photosynthesis in crops than in non-crop angiosperms.
