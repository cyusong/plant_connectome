Auxin flow is important for different root developmental processes such as root formation, emergence, elongation and gravitropism. However, the detailed information about the mechanisms regulating the auxin flow is less well understood in rice. We characterized the auxin transport-related mutants, Ospin-formed2-1 (Ospin2-1) and Ospin2-2, which exhibited curly root phenotypes and altered lateral root formation patterns in rice. The OsPIN2 gene encodes a member of the auxin efflux carrier proteins that possibly regulates the basipetal auxin flow from the root tip toward the root elongation zone. According to DR5-driven GUS expression, there is an asymmetric auxin distribution in the mutants that corresponded with the asymmetric cell elongation pattern in the mutant root tip. Auxin transport inhibitor, N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid and Ospin2-1 Osiaa13 double mutant rescued the curly root phenotype indicating that this phenotype results from a defect in proper auxin distribution. The typical curly root phenotype was not observed when Ospin2-1 was grown in distilled water as an alternative to tap water, although higher auxin levels were found at the root tip region of the mutant than that of the wild-type. Therefore, the lateral root formation zone in the mutant was shifted basipetally compared with the wild-type. These results reflect that an altered auxin flow in the root tip region is responsible for root elongation growth and lateral root formation patterns in rice.
