The phenomenon of cyclic electron transport was first characterized in higher plant chloroplasts 50 years ago, yet there is still a debate about whether or not this is a physiological process. The recent isolation of mutants that appear to lack cyclic electron transport, as well as new data providing functional evidence for its occurrence, support the notion that this pathway plays an important role in plant responses to stress, providing a pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane to trigger non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. At present, little is known about the regulation of cyclic electron transport, but it is possible that this is activated in response to a low redox potential in the chloroplast stroma.
