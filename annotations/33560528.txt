Salt cress (Eutrema salsugineum) presents relatively high phosphate (Pi) use efficiency cy in its natural habitat. Phosphate Transporters (PHTs) play critical roles in Pi acquisition and homeostasis. Here, a comparative study of PHT families between salt cress and Arabidopsis was performed. A total of 27 putative PHT genes were identified in E. salsugineum genome. Notably, seven tandem genes encoding PHT1;3 were found, and function analysis in Arabidopsis indicated at least six EsPHT1;3s participated in Pi uptake. Meanwhile, different expression profiles of PHT genes between the two species under Pi limitation and salt stress were documented. Most PHT1 genes were down-regulated in Arabidopsis while up-regulated in salt cress under salinity, among which EsPHT1;9 was further characterized. EsPHT1;9 was involved in root-to-shoot Pi translocation. Particularly, the promoter of EsPHT1;9 outperformed that of AtPHT1;9 in promoting Pi translocation, K<sup>+</sup> /Na<sup>+</sup> ratio, thereby salt tolerance. Through cis-element analysis, we identified a bZIP transcription factor EsABF5 negatively regulating EsPHT1;9 and plant tolerance to low-Pi and salt stress. Altogether, more copies and divergent transcriptional regulation of PHT genes contribute to salt cress adaptation to the co-occurrence of salinity and Pi limitation, which add our knowledge on the evolutionary and molecular component of multistress- tolerance of this species.
