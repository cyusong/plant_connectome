Phosphate (Pi) transporters mediate acquisition and transportation of Pi within plants. Here, we investigated the functions of OsPht1;4 (OsPT4), one of the 13 members of the Pht1 family in rice. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed strong expression of OsPT4 in roots and embryos, and OsPT4 promoter analysis using reporter genes confirmed these findings. Analysis using rice protoplasts showed that OsPT4 localized to the plasma membrane. OsPT4 complemented a yeast mutant defective in Pi uptake, and also facilitated increased accumulation of Pi in Xenopus oocytes. Further, OsPT4 genetically modified (GM) rice lines were generated by knockout/knockdown or over-expression of OsPT4. Pi concentrations in roots and shoots were significantly lower and higher in knockout/knockdown and over-expressing plants, respectively, compared to wild-type under various Pi regimes. (33) Pi uptake translocation assays corroborated the altered acquisition and mobilization of Pi in OsPT4 GM plants. We also observed effects of altered expression levels of OsPT4 in GM plants on the concentration of Pi, the size of the embryo, and several attributes related to seed development. Overall, our results suggest that OsPT4 encodes a plasma membrane-localized Pi transporter that facilitates acquisition and mobilization of Pi, and also plays an important role in development of the embryo in rice.
