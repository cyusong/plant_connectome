['18559960', 'Mitochondrial fission is achieved partially by the activity of self-assembling  dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) in diverse organisms. Mitochondrial fission in  Arabidopsis thaliana is mediated by DRP3A and DRP3B, but the other genes and  molecular mechanisms involved have yet to be elucidated. To identify these genes,  we screened and analyzed Arabidopsis mutants with longer and fewer mitochondria  than those of the wild type. ELM1 was found to be responsible for the phenotype  of elongated mitochondria. This phenotype was also observed in drp3a plants. EST  and genomic sequences similar to ELM1 were found in seed plants but not in other  eukaryotes. ELM1:green fluorescent protein (GFP) was found to surround  mitochondria, and ELM1 interacts with both DPR3A and DRP3B. In the elm1 mutant,  DRP3A:GFP was observed in the cytosol, whereas in wild-type Arabidopsis,  DRP3A:GFP localized to the ends and constricted sites of mitochondria. These  results collectively suggest that mitochondrial fission in Arabidopsis is  mediated by the plant-specific factor ELM1, which is required for the  relocalization of DRP3A (and possibly also DRP3B) from the cytosol to  mitochondrial fission sites.', '2008 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.058578', 'Tsutsumi']
