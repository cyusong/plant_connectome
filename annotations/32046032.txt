Plant architecture is an important factor for crop production. Plant height, tiller pattern, and panicle morphology are decisive factors for high grain yield in rice. Here, we isolated and characterized a T-DNA insertion rice mutant <i>Osdmt1</i> (Oryza sativa dwarf and multi-tillering1) that exhibited a severe dwarf phenotype and multi-tillering. Molecular cloning revealed that <i>DMT1</i> encodes a plasma membrane protein that was identified as a putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable mechanosensitive channel. The transcript expression level was significantly higher in the <i>dmt1</i> mutant compared to wild type (WT). Additionally, the <i>dmt1</i> homozygous mutant displayed a stronger phenotype than that of the WT and heterozygous seedlings after gibberellic acid (GA) treatment. RNA-seq and iTRAQ-based proteome analyses were performed between the <i>dmt1</i> mutant and WT. The transcriptome profile revealed that several genes involved in GA and strigolactone (SL) biosyntheses were altered in the <i>dmt1</i> mutant. Ca<sup>2+</sup> and other ion concentrations were significantly enhanced in the <i>dmt1</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>DMT1</i> contributes to the accumulation of several ions in rice. Moreover, several EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, including CMLs (CaM-like proteins) and CDPKs (calcium-dependent protein kinases), displayed markedly altered transcript expression and protein levels in the <i>dmt1</i> mutant. Overall, these findings aid in the elucidation of the multiply regulatory roles of <i>OsDMT1/OsMCA1</i> in rice.
