Microbial symbiosis in legumes is achieved through nitrogen-fixing root nodules, and these are important for sustainable agriculture. The molecular mechanisms underlying development of root nodules in polyploid legume crops are largely understudied. Through map-based cloning and QTL-seq approaches, we identified a pair of homoeologous GRAS transcription factor genes, Nodulation Signaling Pathway 2 (AhNSP2-B07 or Nb) and AhNSP2-A08 (Na), controlling nodulation in cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), an allotetraploid legume crop, which exhibited non-Mendelian and Mendelian inheritance, respectively. The segregation of nodulation in the progeny of Nananbnb genotypes followed a 3:1 Mendelian ratio, in contrast to the 5:3~1:1 non-Mendelian ratio for nanaNbnb genotypes. Additionally, a much higher frequency of the nb allele (13%) than the na allele (4%) exists in the peanut germplasm collection, suggesting that Nb is less essential than Na in nodule organogenesis. Our findings reveal the genetic basis of naturally occurred non-nodulating peanut plants, which can be potentially used for nitrogen fixation improvement in peanut. Furthermore, the results have implications for and provide insights into the evolution of homoeologous genes in allopolyploid species.
