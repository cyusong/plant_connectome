['12514139', 'The tom2-1 mutation of Arabidopsis thaliana reduces the efficiency of  intracellular multiplication of tobamoviruses. The tom2-1 mutant was derived from  fast-neutron-irradiated seeds, and the original mutant line also carries ttm1, a  dominant modifier that increases tobamovirus multiplication efficiency in a  tobamovirus-strain-specific manner in the tom2-1 genetic background. Here, we  show that the tom2-1 mutation involved a deletion of approximately 20 kb in the  nuclear genome. The deleted region included two genes named TOM2A and TOM2B that  were both associated with the tom2-1 phenotype, whereas ttm1 corresponded to the  translocation of part of the deleted region that included intact TOM2B but not  TOM2A. TOM2A encodes a 280 amino acid putative four-pass transmembrane protein  with a C-terminal farnesylation signal, while TOM2B encodes a 122 amino acid  basic protein. The split-ubiquitin assay demonstrated an interaction of TOM2A  both with itself and with TOM1, an integral membrane protein of A.thaliana  presumed to be an essential constituent of tobamovirus replication complex. The  data presented here suggest that TOM2A is also an integral part of the  tobamovirus replication complex.', '2003 Jan 15', 'EMBO J', '10.1093/emboj/cdg034', 'Ishikawa']
