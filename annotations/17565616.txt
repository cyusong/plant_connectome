['17565616', 'Seed aging decreases the quality of seed and grain and results in agricultural  and economic losses. Alterations that impair cellular structures and metabolism  are implicated in seed deterioration, but the molecular and biochemical bases for  seed aging are not well understood. Ablation of the gene for a membrane  lipid-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (PLDalpha1) in Arabidopsis enhanced seed  germination and oil stability after storage or exposure of seeds to adverse  conditions. The PLDalpha1-deficient seeds exhibited a smaller loss of unsaturated  fatty acids and lower accumulation of lipid peroxides than did wild-type seeds.  However, PLDalpha1-knockdown seeds were more tolerant of aging than were  PLDalpha1-knockout seeds. The results demonstrate the PLDalpha1 plays an  important role in seed deterioration and aging in Arabidopsis. A high level of  PLDalpha1 is detrimental to seed quality, and attenuation of PLDalpha1 expression  has the potential to improve oil stability, seed quality and seed longevity.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03103.x', 'Wang']
