['29284022', 'Pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) or loss of  Arabidopsis thaliana PARG1 (poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase) disrupt a subset of  plant defenses. In the present study we examined the impact of altered  poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on early gene expression induced by the microbe-associate  molecular patterns (MAMPs) flagellin (flg22) and EF-Tu (elf18). Stringent  statistical analyses and filtering identified 178 genes having MAMP-induced mRNA  abundance patterns that were altered by either PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide  (3AB) or PARG1 knockout. From the identified set of 178 genes, over fifty  Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines were chosen and screened for altered basal  defense responses. Subtle alterations in callose deposition and/or seedling  growth in response to those MAMPs were observed in knockouts of At3g55630 (FPGS3,  a cytosolic folylpolyglutamate synthetase), At5g15660 (containing an F-box  domain), At1g47370 (a TIR-X (Toll-Interleukin Receptor domain)), and At5g64060 (a  predicted pectin methylesterase inhibitor). Over-represented GO terms for the  gene expression study included "innate immune response" for elf18/parg1,  highlighting a subset of elf18-activated defense-associated genes whose  expression is altered in parg1 plants. The study also allowed a tightly  controlled comparison of early mRNA abundance responses to flg22 and elf18 in  wild-type Arabidopsis, which revealed many differences. The PARP inhibitor  3-methoxybenzamide (3MB) was also used in the gene expression profiling, but  pleiotropic impacts of this inhibitor were observed. This transcriptomics study  revealed targets for further dissection of MAMP-induced plant immune responses,  impacts of PARP inhibitors, and the molecular mechanisms by which  poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation regulates plant responses to MAMPs.', '2017', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0190268', 'Bent']
