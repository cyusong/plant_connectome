The Tdp1 gene encoding tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase has been extensively investigated in animal cells, due to the role of this enzyme in the repair of topoisomerase I-DNA covalent lesions. In contrast, information in this regard is totally missing in plants. We report for the first time in plants on the Tdp1 gene family from barrel medic (Medicago truncatula Gaertn.), composed of two members, hereby named MtTdp1alpha and MtTdp1beta. The expression profiles of MtTdp1alpha and MtTdp1beta genes were evaluated in plantlets grown in vitro using copper and polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) as stress agents. In situ detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was carried out by histochemical staining, while the level of oxidative DNA damage, quantified in terms of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-dG), increased up to 7.4- and 6.7-fold in response to copper and PEG 6000 treatments, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that both Tdp1 genes were significantly up-regulated in response to copper and PEG. The Tdp1 genes were also significantly up-regulated during seed rehydration, an aspect of seed physiology in which DNA repair is a key component. Thus, the Tdp1 genes might be used as novel tools for improving stress tolerance in crops. The expression patterns of the barrel medic top1alpha and top1beta genes, encoding distinct isoforms of DNA topoisomerase I, were also analyzed and discussed to acquire additional information on their specific functions, closely related to that of the Tdp1 gene in animal cells.
