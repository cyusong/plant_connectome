Microorganisms associated with the phyllosphere play a crucial role in protecting plants from diseases, and their composition and diversity are strongly influenced by heavy metal contaminants. Dioecious plants are known to exhibit sexual dimorphism in metal accumulation and tolerance between male and female individuals. Hence, in this study we used male and female full-siblings of Populus deltoides to investigate whether the two sexes present differences in their phyllosphere microbiome structures and in their associated resistance to the leaf pathogenic fungus Pestalotiopsis microspora after exposure to excess soil cadmium (Cd). We found that Cd-treated male plants grew better and accumulated more leaf Cd than females. Cd stress reduced the lesion areas on leaves of both sexes after pathogen infection, but male plants exhibited better resistance than females. More importantly, Cd exposure differentially altered the structure and function of the phyllosphere microbiomes between the male and female plants, with more abundant ecologically beneficial microbes and decreased pathogenic fungal taxa harbored by male plants. In vitro toxicity tests suggested that the sexual difference in pathogen resistance could be attribute to both direct Cd toxicity and indirect shifts in the phyllosphere microbiome. This study provides new information relevant for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the effects of heavy metals involved in plant-pathogen interactions.
