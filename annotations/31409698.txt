['31409698', 'In addition to the classical electron transport pathway coupled to ATP synthesis,  plant mitochondria have an alternative pathway that involves type II NAD(P)H  dehydrogenases (NDs) and alternative oxidase (AOX). This alternative pathway  participates in thermogenesis in select organs of some species and is thought to  help prevent cellular damage during exposure to environmental stress. Here, we  investigated the function and role of one alternative path component, AtNDB2,  using a transgenic approach in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Disruption of  AtNDB2 expression via T-DNA insertion led to a 90% decrease of external NADH  oxidation in isolated mitochondria. Overexpression of AtNDB2 led to increased  AtNDB2 protein abundance in mitochondria but did not enhance external NADH  oxidation significantly unless AtAOX1A was concomitantly overexpressed and  activated, demonstrating a functional link between these enzymes. Plants lacking  either AtAOX1A or AtNDB2 were more sensitive to combined drought and elevated  light treatments, whereas plants overexpressing these components showed increased  tolerance and capacity for poststress recovery. We conclude that AtNDB2 is the  predominant external NADH dehydrogenase in mitochondria and together with AtAOX1A  forms a complete, functional, nonphosphorylating pathway of electron transport,  whose operation enhances tolerance to environmental stress. This study  demonstrates that at least one of the alternative NDs, as well as AOX, are  important for the stress response.', '2019 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00877', 'Soole']
