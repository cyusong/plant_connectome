['16627697', 'Expression of a functional yellow fluorescent protein fusion to cellulose  synthase (CESA) in transgenic Arabidopsis plants allowed the process of cellulose  deposition to be visualized in living cells. Spinning disk confocal microscopy  revealed that CESA complexes in the plasma membrane moved at constant rates in  linear tracks that were aligned and were coincident with cortical microtubules.  Within each observed linear track, complex movement was bidirectional. Inhibition  of microtubule polymerization changed the fine-scale distribution and pattern of  moving CESA complexes in the membrane, indicating a relatively direct mechanism  for guidance of cellulose deposition by the cytoskeleton.', '2006 Jun 9', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1126551', 'Ehrhardt']
