['14551328', 'Mutations in the QUARTET loci in Arabidopsis result in failure of microspore  separation during pollen development due to a defect in degradation of the pollen  mother cell wall during late stages of pollen development. Mutations in a new  locus required for microspore separation, QRT3, were isolated, and the  corresponding gene was cloned by T-DNA tagging. QRT3 encodes a protein that is  approximately 30% similar to an endopolygalacturonase from peach (Prunus  persica). The QRT3 protein was expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and  found to exhibit polygalacturonase activity. In situ hybridization experiments  showed that QRT3 is specifically and transiently expressed in the tapetum during  the phase when microspores separate from their meiotic siblings.  Immunohistochemical localization of QRT3 indicated that the protein is secreted  from tapetal cells during the early microspore stage. Thus, QRT3 plays a direct  role in degrading the pollen mother cell wall during microspore development.', '2003 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.028266', 'Somerville']
