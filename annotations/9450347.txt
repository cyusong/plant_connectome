['9450347', 'The cloning and characterization of a novel kinesin-like protein (kinesin-like  calmodulin-binding protein, KCBP) from Arabidopsis and other plants has recently  been described. Unlike all other known kinesin-like proteins, KCBP interacts with  calmodulin in the presence of micromolar calcium. An antibody specific to KCBP  was raised using a calmodulin-binding synthetic peptide that is unique to KCBP.  The KCBP antibody detected a single protein of about 140 kDa in Arabidopsis and  tobacco, the size predicted from cDNA sequences. In synchronized cell cultures,  the amount of KCBP was abundant during M-phase and very low in interphase. To get  some insight into the function of this novel motor protein, KCBP in Arabidopsis  and tobacco cells was localized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using  affinity-purified anti-KCBP antibody. The KCBP was localized to the preprophase  band, the mitotic spindle and the phragmoplast. The association of KCBP with  microtubule arrays in dividing cells suggests that this minus-end-directed  microtubule motor protein is likely to be involved in the formation of these  microtubule arrays and/or functions associated with these structures.', '1997 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1997.12061429.x', 'Reddy']
