['24118480', 'The causal relationship between cell division and growth in plants is complex.  Although altered expression of cell-cycle genes frequently leads to altered organ  growth, there are many examples where manipulation of the division machinery  leads to a limited outcome at the level of organ form, despite changes in  constituent cell size. One possibility, which has been under-explored, is that  altered division patterns resulting from manipulation of cell-cycle gene  expression alter the physiology of the organ, and that this has an effect on  growth. We performed a series of experiments on retinoblastoma-related protein  (RBR), a well characterized regulator of the cell cycle, to investigate the  outcome of altered cell division on leaf physiology. Our approach involved  combination of high-resolution microCT imaging and physiological analysis with a  transient gene induction system, providing a powerful approach for the study of  developmental physiology. Our investigation identifies a new role for RBR in  mesophyll differentiation that affects tissue porosity and the distribution of  air space within the leaf. The data demonstrate the importance of RBR in early  leaf development and the extent to which physiology adapts to modified cellular  architecture resulting from altered cell-cycle gene expression.', '2013 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12342', 'Fleming']
