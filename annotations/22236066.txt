['22236066', '* Long-chain bases (LCBs) are pleiotropic sphingolipidic signals in eukaryotes.  We investigated the source and function of phytosphingosine-1-phosphate (PHS-P),  a phospho-LCB rapidly and transiently formed in Arabidopsis thaliana on chilling.  * PHS-P was analysed by thin-layer chromatography following in vivo metabolic  radiolabelling. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to identify the  sphingosine kinase isoforms involved in cold-responsive PHS-P synthesis. Gene  expression, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and growth phenotypes of  three LCB kinase mutants (lcbk1, sphk1 and lcbk2) were studied following cold  exposure. * Chilling provoked the rapid and transient formation of PHS-P in  Arabidopsis cultured cells and plantlets. Cold-evoked PHS-P synthesis was reduced  by LCB kinase inhibitors and abolished in the LCB kinase lcbk2 mutant, but not in  lcbk1 and sphk1 mutants. lcbk2 presented a constitutive AtMPK6 activation at  22 degrees C. AtMPK6 activation was also triggered by PHS-P treatment independently of  PHS/PHS-P balance. lcbk2 mutants grew comparably with wild-type plants at 22 and  4 degrees C, but exhibited a higher root growth at 12 degrees C, correlated with an altered  expression of the cold-responsive DELLA gene RGL3. * Together, our data indicate  a function for LCBK2 in planta. Furthermore, they connect PHS-P formation with  plant response to cold, expanding the field of LCB signalling in plants.', '2012 Apr', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.04017.x', 'Guillas']
