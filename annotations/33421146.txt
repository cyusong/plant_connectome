Drought stress negatively affects crop performance and weakens global food security. It triggers the activation of downstream pathways, mainly through phytohormones homeostasis and their signaling networks, which further initiate the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (SMs). Roots sense drought stress, the signal travels to the above-ground tissues to induce systemic phytohormones signaling. The systemic signals further trigger the biosynthesis of SMs and stomatal closure to prevent water loss. SMs primarily scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) to protect plants from lipid peroxidation and also perform additional defense-related functions. Moreover, drought-induced volatile SMs can alert the plant tissues to perform drought stress mitigating functions in plants. Other phytohormone-induced stress responses include cell wall and cuticle thickening, root and leaf morphology alteration, and anatomical changes of roots, stems, and leaves, which in turn minimize the oxidative stress, water loss, and other adverse effects of drought. Exogenous applications of phytohormones and genetic engineering of phytohormones signaling and biosynthesis pathways mitigate the drought stress effects. Direct modulation of the SMs biosynthetic pathway genes or indirect via phytohormones' regulation provides drought tolerance. Thus, phytohormones and SMs play key roles in plant development under the drought stress environment in crop plants.
