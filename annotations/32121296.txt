Seed development, which involves mainly the embryo, endosperm and integuments, is regulated by different signaling pathways, leading to various changes in seed size or seed weight. Therefore, uncovering the genetic and molecular mechanisms of seed development has great potential for improving crop yields. The phytohormone auxin is a key regulator required for modulating different cellular processes involved in seed development. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the role of auxin biosynthesis, transport, signaling, conjugation, and catabolism during seed development. More importantly, we not only summarize the research progress on the genetic and molecular regulation of seed development mediated by auxin but also discuss the potential of manipulating auxin metabolism and its signaling pathway for improving crop seed weight.
