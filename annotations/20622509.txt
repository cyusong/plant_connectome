Phytomers are developmental compartments that display stereotypical patterns dependent on whether they are initiated during the vegetative phase or the floral phases. Differences in appearance result from differential partitioning mechanisms responsible for allocation of cells to different components of the phytomer. The tasselsheath loci of maize control cell partitioning within the phytomer, indirectly influencing growth and development of its individual components. The tasselsheath4 (tsh4) gene accomplishes this through regulation of the ramosa2 (ra2) meristem determinacy gene, whereas tasselsheath1 (tsh1) appears to function differently.

tsh4: !regulates! ra2
tsh1: !functions differently from! tsh4
