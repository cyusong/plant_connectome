The cultivated peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.) is a legume consumed worldwide in the form of oil, nuts, peanut butter, and candy. Improving peanut production and nutrition will require new technologies to enable novel trait development. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) is a powerful and versatile genome-editing tool for introducing genetic changes for studying gene expression and improving crops, including peanuts. An efficient in vivo transient CRISPR-Cas9- editing system using protoplasts as a testbed could be a versatile platform to optimize this technology. In this study, multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was performed in peanut protoplasts to disrupt a major allergen gene with the help of an endogenous tRNA-processing system. In this process, we successfully optimized protoplast isolation and transformation with green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid, designed two sgRNAs for an allergen gene, <i>Ara h 2</i>, and tested their efficiency by in vitro digestion with Cas9. Finally, through deep-sequencing analysis, several edits were identified in our target gene after PEG-mediated transformation in protoplasts with a Cas9 and sgRNA-containing vector. These findings demonstrated that a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated protoplast transformation system can serve as a rapid and effective tool for transient expression assays and sgRNA validation in peanut.
