Phytomelatonin is a universal signal molecule that regulates plant growth and stress responses; however, only one receptor that can directly bind with and perceive melatonin signaling has been identified so far, namely AtPMTR1/CAND2 in Arabidopsis. Whether other plants contain a similar receptor and, if so, how it functions is still unknown. In this study, we identified a new phytomelatonin receptor in the monocot maize (Zea mays), and investigated its role in plant responses to osmotic and drought stress. Using homology searching, we identified a plasma membrane-localized protein, Zm00001eb214610/ZmPMTR1, with strong binding activity to melatonin as a potential phytomelatonin receptor in maize. Overexpressing ZmPMTR1 in Arabidopsis Col-0 promoted osmotic stress tolerance, and rescued osmotic stress sensitivity of the Arabidopsis cand2-1 mutant. Furthermore, ZmPMTR1 also largely rescued defects in melatonin-induced stomatal closure in the cand2-1 mutant, thereby reducing water loss rate and increasing tolerance to drought stress. In addition, we identified a maize mutant of ZmPMTR1, EMS4-06e2fl, with a point-mutation causing premature termination of protein translation, and found that this mutant had lower leaf temperatures, increased rate of water loss, and enhanced drought stress sensitivity. Thus, we present ZmPMTR1 as the first phytomelatonin receptor to be identified and examined in a monocot plant, and our results indicate that it plays an important function in the response of maize to drought stress.
