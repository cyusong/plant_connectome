The cortical motor cells (CMCs) in a legume pulvinus execute the reversible deformation in leaf movement that is driven by changes in turgor pressure. In contrast to the underlying osmotic regulation proper, the cell wall structure of CMCs that contributes to the movement has yet to be characterized in detail. Here, we report that the cell wall of CMCs has circumferential slits with low levels of cellulose deposition, which are widely conserved among legume species. This structure is unique and distinct from that of any other primary cell walls reported so far; thus, we named them "pulvinar slits." Notably, we predominantly detected de-methyl-esterified homogalacturonan inside pulvinar slits, with a low deposition of highly methyl-esterified homogalacturonan, as with cellulose. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated that the cell wall composition of pulvini is different from that of other axial organs, such as petioles or stems. Moreover, monosaccharide analysis showed that pulvini are pectin-rich organs like developing stems and that the amount of galacturonic acid in pulvini is greater than in developing stems. Computer modeling suggested that pulvinar slits facilitate anisotropic extension in the direction perpendicular to the slits in the presence of turgor pressure. When tissue slices of CMCs were transferred to different extracellular osmotic conditions, pulvinar slits altered their opening width, indicating their deformability. In this study, we thus characterized a distinctive cell wall structure of CMCs, adding to knowledge of repetitive and reversible organ deformation as well as the structural diversity and function of the plant cell wall.
