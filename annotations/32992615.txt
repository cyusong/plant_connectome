Ultraviolet B (UV-B) light, as a physical elicitor, can promote the secondary metabolites biosynthesis in plants. We investigated effects of different energy levels of UV-B radiation on growth and bioactive compounds of <i>Crepidiastrum denticulatum</i>. Three-week-old seedlings were grown in a plant factory for 5 weeks. Plants were subjected to different levels of UV-B (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.25 W m<sup>-2</sup>), 6 h a day for 6 days. All UV-B treatments had no negative effect on the shoot dry weight; however, relatively high energy treatments (1.0 and 1.25 W m<sup>-2</sup>) inhibited the shoot fresh weight. UV-B light of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 W m<sup>-2</sup> did not affect total chlorophyll and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents; however, they increased total carotenoid content. On 4 days, 0.25 W m<sup>-2</sup> treatment increased antioxidant capacity, total hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) content, and several sesquiterpenes. Treatments with 1.0 and 1.25 W m<sup>-2</sup> increased total carotenoid, total HCAs, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents, and destroyed chlorophyll pigments, reducing maximum quantum yield of photosystem II and causing visible damage to leaves. Partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) showed that secondary metabolites were distinguishably changed according to energy levels of UV-B. The potential of 0.25 W m<sup>-2</sup> UV-B for the efficient production of bioactive compounds without growth inhibition in <i>C. denticulatum</i> was identified.
