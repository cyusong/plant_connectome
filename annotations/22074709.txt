Recent studies suggest that intercellular transport via plasmodesmata (PD) is regulated by cellular redox state. Until now, this relationship has been unclear, as increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been associated with both increased and decreased intercellular transport via PD. Here, we show that silencing two genes that both increase transport via PD, INCREASED SIZE EXCLUSION LIMIT1 (ISE1) and ISE2, alters organelle redox state. Using redox-sensitive green fluorescent proteins targeted to the mitochondria or plastids, we show that, relative to wild-type leaves, plastids are more reduced in both ISE1- and ISE2-silenced leaves, whereas mitochondria are more oxidized in ISE1-silenced leaves. We further show that PD transport is positively regulated by ROS production in mitochondria following treatment with salicylhydroxamic acid but negatively regulated by an oxidative shift in both chloroplasts and mitochondria following treatment with paraquat. Thus, oxidative shifts in the mitochondrial redox state positively regulate intercellular transport in leaves, but oxidative shifts in the plastid redox state counteract this effect and negatively regulate intercellular transport. This proposed model reconciles previous contradictory evidence relating ROS production to PD transport and supports accumulating evidence that mitochondria and plastids are crucial regulators of PD function.
