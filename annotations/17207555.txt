The mutated melon ethylene receptor gene Cm-ERS1/H70A was introduced into tobacco and induced stable sterility in transgenic lines. This gene contains a missense mutation that converts the His(70) residue to Ala in the melon ethylene receptor gene Cm-ERS1. To test the applicability of this inducible sterility system to other plants, lettuce (Lactuca sativa) was transformed with the gene using Agrobacterium, and putative transformants containing Cm-ERS1/H70A were obtained. Thirteen randomly selected putative transformants were grown in a growth room under constant conditions, and seven of the lines showed sterility or significantly reduced fertility. DNA gel blot analysis confirmed the integration of the Cm-ERS1/H70A gene into the genomes of the putative transformants, and RT-PCR and protein gel blot analysis confirmed the expression of Cm-ERS1/H70A mRNA and protein in all of the transformants. Five transformants showing sterility or reduced fertility when grown in a growth room under constant conditions were randomly selected to be grown in an open-air greenhouse under various environmental conditions. All five showed stable sterility under the various conditions. These results suggest that Cm-ERS1/H70A can induce sterility in heterologous transgenic plants.
