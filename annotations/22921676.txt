Soil salinization is a global issue that hampers agricultural production. Chloride is one of the prominent anions on saline land that cause toxicity to the plant. We previously identified the GmCLC1 gene from soybean (Glycine max) that encodes a putative tonoplast-localized chloride transporter. In this study, using electrophysiological analysis, we demonstrated the chloride transport function of GmCLC1. Interestingly, this chloride transport activity is pH dependent, suggesting that GmCLC1 is probably a chloride/proton antiporter. When the cDNA of GmCLC1 was expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells under the control of a constitutive promoter, the protective effect against salinity stress in transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells was also found to be pH sensitive. In the native host soybean, the expression of GmCLC1 gene is regulated by pH. All these findings support the notion that the function of GmCLC1 is regulated by pH.
