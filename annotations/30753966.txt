Fruit cracking is a serious problem in Litchi chinensis cv. Baitangying orchards, but few advances have been made in understanding the molecular basis of cracking susceptibility in 'Baitangying'. In this work, we conducted transcriptome and quantitative proteome analyses of the pericarps of three kinds of litchi: noncracking 'Feizixiao' (cracking-resistant cultivar, F), noncracking 'Baitangying' (B), and cracking 'Baitangying' (CB). A total of 101 genes and 14 proteins with the same regulatory changes were found to overlap between CB vs. B and B vs. F, and we focused on these results to avoid the effects of passive progression after fruit cracking. The obtained data suggest that fruit cracking susceptibility in 'Baitangying' is related to pericarp photosynthetic characteristics and the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in this cultivar, which lead to changes in cuticle structure. Furthermore, differences in the pericarp hormone balance between 'Baitangying' and 'Feizixiao' may influence the susceptibility of 'Baitangying' to fruit cracking. This integrated analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data indicates that susceptibility to fruit cracking in 'Baitangying' litchi is regulated both translationally and posttranslationally. Our results may help provide a new perspective for further study of the mechanisms that govern fruit cracking susceptibility in 'Baitangying' litchi and other fruits.
