Rice tillering, a key architecture trait determining grain yield, is highly regulated by a class of newly identified phytohormones, strigolactones (SLs). However, the whole SL signaling pathway from the receptor to downstream transcription factors to finally inhibit tillering remains unrevealed. In this study, we first found that brassinosteroids (BRs) strongly enhance tillering by promoting bud outgrowth in rice, which is largely different from the function of BRs in Arabidopsis. Genetic and biochemical analyses indicated that both the SL and BR signaling pathways control rice tillering by regulating the stability of D53 and/or the OsBZR1-RLA1-DLT module, a transcriptional complex in the rice BR signaling pathway. We further found that D53 interacts with OsBZR1 to inhibit the expression of FC1, a local inhibitor of tillering, and that this inhibition depends on direct DNA binding by OsBZR1, which recruits D53 to the FC1 promoter in rice buds. Taken together, these findings uncover a mechanism illustrating how SLs and BRs coordinately regulate rice tillering via the early responsive gene FC1.
