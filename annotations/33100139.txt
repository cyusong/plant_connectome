The fruit of Chinese jujube (<i>Ziziphus jujube</i>) is widely consumed by human beings due to its high proteins, vitamins, and mineral nutrients. The harvest time of Chinese jujube fruit determines its quality, while ethylene plays a pivotal role in fruit ripening. Nevertheless, the relationship between ethylene biosynthesis/signal transduction and fruit ripening of Chinese jujube is still elusive. Here, the Chinese jujube fruit ripening with its fruit peel color change from cyan to dark red at seven different ripening stages (stage I-VII) and expression levels of genes related to ethylene synthesis and signal transduction were determined. Results showed that expression levels of <i>ZjACO1-3, ZjETR2, ZjERF1</i>, and <i>ZjERF4</i> were increasingly upregulated, whereas the expression levels of <i>ZjERS1, ZjETI, ZjERF2</i>, and <i>ZjERF3</i> were downregulated from green to red fruit ripening stages. Among them, <i>ZjACO1-3</i> promoters contain ethylene response element. Taken together, Chinese jujube fruit ripening might be affected by the ethylene signaling which was mainly regulated by <i>ZjACO</i>, a gene involved in ethylene biosynthesis. This research supports theories and techniques for the storage, preservation and molecular breeding of <i>Z. jujube</i>.
