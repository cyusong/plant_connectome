Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are a large group of plant-specific transmembrane proteins mainly acting as receptors or co-receptors of various extracellular signals. They usually turn extracellular signals into intracellular responses via altering gene expression profiles. However, recent studies confirmed that many RLKs can physically interact with diverse membrane-localized transport proteins and regulate their activities for speedy responses in limited tissues or cells. In this minireview, we highlight recent discoveries regarding how RLKs can work with membrane transport proteins collaboratively and thereby trigger cellular responses in a precise and rapid manner. It is anticipated that such regulation broadly presents in plants and more examples will be gradually revealed when in-depth analyses are conducted for the functions of RLKs.
