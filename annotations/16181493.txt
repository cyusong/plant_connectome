['16181493', "BACKGROUND: The 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs) of gibberellin (GA)  biosynthesis have a key role in the metabolism of a major plant hormone. The  activity of recombinant GA 2ODDs from many species has been characterised in  detail, however little information relates to enzyme purification. Native GA  2ODDs displayed lability during purification. RESULTS: Two GA 2ODDs were  expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The GA 2-oxidase from  Pisum sativum L., PsGA2OX1, was expressed as a glutathione s-transferase (GST)  fusion. It was purified in the three steps of affinity chromatography, GST  removal and gel filtration. Highly pure PsGA2OX1 was obtained at a yield of 0.3  mg/g of cells. It displayed a Km of 0.024 microM and a Vmax of 4.4 pkat/mg toward  [1beta,2beta,3beta-3H3]GA20. The GA 3-oxidase from Arabidopsis thaliana,  AtGA3OX4, was expressed as a poly(His)-tagged thioredoxin fusion. It was purified  by Immobilised Metal Affinity Chromatography followed by gel filtration. Cleavage  of the fusion took place between the two purification steps. Highly pure AtGA3OX4  was obtained at a yield of 0.01 mg/g of cells. It displayed a Km of 0.82 microM  and Vmax of 52,500 pkat/mg toward [1beta,2beta,3beta-3H3]GA20. CONCLUSION: Fusion  tags were required to stabilise and solubilise PsGA2OX1 and AtGA3OX4 during E.  coli expression. The successful purification of milligram quantities of PsGA2OX1  enables mechanistic and structural studies not previously possible on GA 2ODDs. A  moderate yield of pure AtGA3OX4 requires the further optimisation of the latter  stages of the enzyme purification schedule. PsGA2OX1's action in planta as  deduced from the effect of the null mutation sln on GA levels in seeds is in  agreement with the kinetic parameters of the recombinant enzyme.", '2005 Sep 25', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-5-19', 'Andersson']
