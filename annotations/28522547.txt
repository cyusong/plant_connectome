['28522547', 'The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) Ile, Val, and Leu are essential nutrients  that humans and other animals obtain from plants. However, total and relative  amounts of plant BCAAs rarely match animal nutritional needs, and improvement  requires a better understanding of the mechanistic basis for BCAA homeostasis. We  present an in vivo regulatory model of BCAA homeostasis derived from analysis of  feedback-resistant Arabidopsis thaliana mutants for the three allosteric  committed enzymes in the biosynthetic network: threonine deaminase (also named  l-O-methylthreonine resistant 1 [OMR1]), acetohydroxyacid synthase small subunit  2 (AHASS2), and isopropylmalate synthase 1 (IPMS1). In this model, OMR1 exerts  primary control on Ile accumulation and functions independently of AHAS and IPMS  AHAS and IPMS regulate Val and Leu homeostasis, where AHAS affects total Val+Leu  and IPMS controls partitioning between these amino acids. In addition, analysis  of feedback-resistant and loss-of-function single and double mutants revealed  that each AHAS and IPMS isoenzyme contributes to homeostasis rather than being  functionally redundant. The characterized feedback resistance mutations caused  increased free BCAA levels in both seedlings and seeds. These results add to our  understanding of the basis of in vivo BCAA homeostasis and inform approaches to  improve the amount and balance of these essential nutrients in crops.', '2017 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00186', 'ORCID:']
