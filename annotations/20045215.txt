Isolated organelles are suitable tools for the investigation of organelle function. However, if the properties of different organelles are to be compared, analysis is generally impeded by the fact that the organelles are isolated independently from each other from different specimens, different tissues or even different plants, i.e. the organelles have been exposed to different conditions during growth and development. Here we describe a method to isolate intact chloroplasts and mitochondria simultaneously from a single pulping of pea leaves, which results in organelles with an essentially identical physiological background. The functionality of the isolated chloroplasts and mitochondria is demonstrated by protein transport experiments, which yield results identical to those obtained with independently isolated organelles. With slight modifications, the method is also successfully applied to organelles from potato and spinach, which implies that it may be generally applicable to organelles from many different species.
