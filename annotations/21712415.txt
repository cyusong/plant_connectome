['21712415', 'The defense-related plant metabolites known as glucosinolates play important  roles in agriculture, ecology, and human health. Despite an advanced biochemical  understanding of the glucosinolate pathway, the source of the reduced sulfur atom  in the core glucosinolate structure remains unknown. Recent evidence has pointed  toward GSH, which would require further involvement of a GSH conjugate processing  enzyme. In this article, we show that an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant impaired in  the production of the gamma-glutamyl peptidases GGP1 and GGP3 has altered  glucosinolate levels and accumulates up to 10 related GSH conjugates. We also  show that the double mutant is impaired in the production of camalexin and  accumulates high amounts of the camalexin intermediate GS-IAN upon induction. In  addition, we demonstrate that the cellular and subcellular localization of GGP1  and GGP3 matches that of known glucosinolate and camalexin enzymes. Finally, we  show that the purified recombinant GGPs can metabolize at least nine of the 10  glucosinolate-related GSH conjugates as well as GS-IAN. Our results demonstrate  that GSH is the sulfur donor in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates and establish  an in vivo function for the only known cytosolic plant gamma-glutamyl peptidases,  namely, the processing of GSH conjugates in the glucosinolate and camalexin  pathways.', '2011 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.083998', 'Halkier']
