ROPs/RACs are the only known signaling Ras superfamily small GTPases in plants. As such they have been suggested to function as central regulators of diverse signaling cascades. The ROP/RAC signaling networks are largely unknown, however, because only few of their effector proteins have been identified. In a paper that was published in the June 5, 2007 issue of Current Biology we described the identification of a novel ROP/RAC effector designated ICR1 (Interactor of Constitutive active ROPs 1). We demonstrated that ICR1 functions as a scaffold that interacts with diverse but specific group of proteins including SEC3 subunit of the exocyst vesicle tethering complex. ICR1-SEC3 complexes can interact with ROPs in vivo and are thereby recruited to the plasma membrane. ICR1 knockdown or silencing leads to cell deformation and loss of the root stem cells population, and ectopic expression of ICR1 phenocopies activated ROPs/RACs. ICR1 presents a new paradigm in ROP/RAC signaling and integrates mechanisms regulating cell form and pattern formation at the whole plant level.
