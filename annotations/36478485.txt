Gravitropism guides growth to shape plant architecture above and below ground. Mutations in LAZY1 impair stem gravitropism and cause less upright inflorescence branches (wider angles). The LAZY1 protein resides at the plasma membrane and in the nucleus. The plasma membrane pool is necessary and sufficient for setting branch angles. To investigate the molecular mechanism of LAZY1 function, we screened for LAZY1-interacting proteins in yeast. We identified BRXL4, a shoot-specific protein related to BREVIS RADIX. The BRXL4-LAZY1 interaction occurred at the plasma membrane in plant cells, and not detectably in the nucleus. Mutations in the C-terminus of LAZY1, but not other conserved regions, prevented the interaction. Opposite to lazy1, brxl4 mutants displayed faster gravitropism and more upright branches. Overexpressing BRXL4 produced strong lazy1 phenotypes. The apparent negative regulation of LAZY1 function is consistent with BRXL4 reducing LAZY1 expression or the amount of LAZY1 at the plasma membrane. Measurements indicated that both are true. LAZY1 mRNA was three-fold more abundant in brxl4 mutants and almost undetectable in BRXL4 overexpressors. Plasma membrane LAZY1 was higher and nuclear LAZY1 lower in brxl4 mutants compared with the wild type. To explain these results, we suggest that BRXL4 reduces the amount of LAZY1 at the plasma membrane where it functions in gravity signaling and promotes LAZY1 accumulation in the nucleus where it reduces LAZY1 expression, possibly by suppressing its own transcription. This explanation of how BRXL4 negatively regulates LAZY1 suggests ways to modify shoot system architecture for practical purposes.
