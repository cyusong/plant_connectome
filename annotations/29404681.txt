Different levels of salt stress affected the OAS-TL expression levels in Pancratium maritimum organs (bulb, leaf and root). A detailed method has been described for the identification of the conserved domain of the OAS-TL cDNA in sea daffodil given the scarce data available for the Amaryllidaceae family. Pancratium maritimum or sea daffodil (Amaryllidaceae) is a bulbous geophyte growing on coastal sands. In this study, we investigated the involvement of cysteine synthesis for salt tolerance through the expression of the enzyme O-acetylserine(thio)lyase (OAS-TL) during the stress response to NaCl treatments in P. maritimum. Quantitative real-time PCR was used in different organs (bulb, leaf and root).
