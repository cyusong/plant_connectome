['22555433', 'Transposable elements (TEs) and DNA repeats are commonly targeted by DNA and  histone methylation to achieve epigenetic gene silencing. We isolated mutations  in two Arabidopsis genes, AtMORC1 and AtMORC6, which cause derepression of  DNA-methylated genes and TEs but no losses of DNA or histone methylation. AtMORC1  and AtMORC6 are members of the conserved Microrchidia (MORC) adenosine  triphosphatase (ATPase) family, which are predicted to catalyze alterations in  chromosome superstructure. The atmorc1 and atmorc6 mutants show decondensation of  pericentromeric heterochromatin, increased interaction of pericentromeric regions  with the rest of the genome, and transcriptional defects that are largely  restricted to loci residing in pericentromeric regions. Knockdown of the single  MORC homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans also impairs transgene silencing. We  propose that the MORC ATPases are conserved regulators of gene silencing in  eukaryotes.', '2012 Jun 15', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1221472', 'Jacobsen']
