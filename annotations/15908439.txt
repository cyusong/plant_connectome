The transition to flowering occurs at the shoot apex; however, most of the characterized genes that affect the timing of floral induction are expressed throughout the plant. To further our understanding of these genes and the flowering process, the vegetative molecular phenotypes of 16 Arabidopsis mutants associated with the major flowering initiation pathways were assayed using a 13,000 clone microarray under two different conditions that affect flowering. All mutants showed at least one change in gene expression other than the mutant flowering gene. Metabolism- and defence-related pathways were the areas with the most frequent gene expression changes detected in the mutants. Several genes such as EARLI1 were differentially expressed in a number of flowering mutants from different flowering pathways. Analysis of the promoter regions of genes differentially expressed identified common promoter elements, indicating some form of common regulation.
