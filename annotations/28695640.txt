Vespicochory, seed dispersal by hornets, is a rare seed dispersal mechanism in angiosperms and, to date, there are few records of this phenomenon. Through field investigations and behavioral assays conducted in four populations of Stemona tuberosa from 2011-2016, we demonstrate that hornets are the primary seed dispersers of S. tuberosa and play an important role in "long-distance" seed dispersal in this species. Furthermore, some ant species act as secondary dispersers and may transport the seeds to safe sites. Hornets and ants provide complementary seed dispersal at different spatial scales. This unique example of insect-plant mutualism may be an underestimated but important strategy to ensure "long-distance" seed dispersal in other myrmecochorous plants.

Hornets: !disperse! S. tuberosa seeds 
Ants: !disperse! S. tuberosa seeds 
Hornets: !provide! "long-distance" seed dispersal 
Ants: !provide! complementary seed dispersal 
Insects: !mutualism with! angiosperms
