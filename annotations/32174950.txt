Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) is known as a critical enzyme responsible for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) generation in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and has an essential function in modulating redox homeostasis and stress responsiveness. In the present work, we characterized the nine members of the G6PDH gene family in soybean. Phylogenic analysis and transit peptide prediction showed that these soybean G6PDHs are divided into plastidic (P) and cytosolic (Cy) isoforms. The subcellular locations of five GmG6PDHs were further verified by confocal microscopy in <i>Arabidopsis</i> mesophyll protoplasts. The respective <i>GmG6PDH</i> genes had distinct expression patterns in various soybean tissues and at different times during seed development. Among them, the <i>Cy</i>-<i>G6PDHs</i> were strongly expressed in roots, developing seeds and nodules, while the transcripts of <i>P-G6PDHs</i> were mainly detected in green tissues. In addition, the activities and transcripts of <i>GmG6PDHs</i> were dramatically stimulated by different stress treatments, including salt, osmotic and alkali. Notably, the expression levels of a cytosolic isoform (GmG6PDH2) were extraordinarily high under salt stress and correlated well with the G6PDH enzyme activities, possibly implying a crucial factor for soybean responses to salinity. Enzymatic assay of recombinant <i>GmG6PDH2</i> proteins expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed that the enzyme encoded by <i>GmG6PDH2</i> had functional NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent G6PDH activity. Further analysis indicated overexpression of <i>GmG6PDH2</i> gene could significantly enhance the resistance of transgenic soybean to salt stress by coordinating with the redox states of ascorbic acid and glutathione pool to suppress reactive oxygen species generation. Together, these results indicate that <i>GmG6PDH2</i> might be the major isoform for NADPH production in PPP, which is involved in the modulation of cellular AsA-GSH cycle to prevent the oxidative damage induced by high salinity.
