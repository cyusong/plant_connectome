Cold stress is one of the main restricting factors affecting plant growth and agricultural production. Complex cold signaling pathways induce the expression of hundreds of cold-sensitive genes. The NAC transcription factor <i>CaNAC035</i> has previously been reported to significantly influence the response of pepper to cold stress. Here, using Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) library screened to search for other relevant molecular factors, we identified that <i>CabHLH79</i> directly binds to the <i>CaNAC035</i> promoter. Different basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) in plants significantly respond to multiple plant stresses, but the mechanism of bHLHs in the cold tolerance of pepper is still unclear. This study investigated the functional characterization of <i>CabHLH79</i> in the regulation of cold resistance in pepper. Down-regulation of <i>CabHLH79</i> in pepper by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) increased its sensitivity to low temperature, whereas overexpression of <i>CabHLH79</i> in pepper or <i>Arabidopsis</i> enhanced cold resistance. Compared with control plants, VIGS mediated of <i>CabHLH79</i> had lower enzyme activity and related gene expression levels, accompanied by higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, relative electrolyte leakage (REL), and malondialdehyde accumulation (MDA) contents. Transient overexpression of <i>CabHLH79</i> pepper positively regulated cold stress response genes and ROS genes, which reduced REL and MDA contents. Similarly, ectopic expression of <i>CabHLH79</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> showed less ROS accumulation, and higher enzymes activities and expression levels. These results indicated that <i>CabHLH79</i> enhanced cold tolerance by enhancing the expression of ROS-related and other cold stress tolerance-related genes. Taken together, our results showed a multifaceted module of bHLH79-NAC035 in the cold stress of pepper.
