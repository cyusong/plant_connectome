Nilaparvata lugens Stål, the brown planthopper (BPH), is one of the most destructive phloem-feeding insects of rice (Oryza sativa L.) throughout Asia. Here, we show that BPH feeding increases the level of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) in the leaf and sheath tissue of both resistant and susceptible rice cultivars. However, in the roots, the NO level increased in the resistant cultivar, but decreased in the susceptible one. A burst of NO production occurred in the sheath within 1 h of infestation with BPH. The production of NO in response to BPH feeding appears to be dependent primarily on the activity of nitric oxide synthase. The application of exogenous NO reduced plant water loss by its effect on both stomatal opening and root architecture. It also stimulated the expression of certain drought stress-related genes, reduced plant height and delayed leaf senescence. Over the short term, NO supplementation reduced the seedling mortality caused by BPH feeding. This suggests that NO signaling plays a role in the rice tolerance response to BPH feeding.
