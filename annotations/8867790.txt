['8867790', 'Serine acetyltransferase, a key enzyme in the L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway of  sulfate assimilating organisms, catalyzes the formation of O-acetylserine, the  immediate precursor of L-cysteine. In higher plants, it is thought that sulfur  assimilation occurs primarily in leaf chloroplasts; however, serine  acetyltransferase is not localized exclusively in this tissue and organelle. At  least three genes for serine acetyltransferase have been identified in the higher  plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Reported here is a cDNA corresponding to one of these  genes, SAT1, a 1,079 bp clone with an open reading frame predicted to encode a  34-kDa protein that is able to functionally complement a serine acetyltransferase  mutant strain of Escherichia coli. The predicted amino acid sequence of SAT1  shows significant homology with bacterial serine acetyltransferases. SAT1,  expressed as a recombinant protein, shows serine acetyltransferase enzyme  activity and cross-reacts with an antibody against the homologous E. coli enzyme.  The first 40 amino acids of the SAT1 polypeptide resembles a plastid transit  peptide, but the polypeptide is probably not plastid localized. Genomic DNA blot  analysis of A. thaliana showed that SAT1 is a single copy gene and RNA blot  analysis revealed that SAT1 is expressed in both leaves and roots.', '1995', 'Cell Mol Biol Res', None, 'Leustek']
