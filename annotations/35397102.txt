Using the whole genome and growth data of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes, we identified two genes associated with enhancement of the growth rate in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. Improving plant growth under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions may contribute to enhanced agricultural yield under future global climate change. In this study, we examined the genes implicated in the enhancement of growth rates under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions by analyzing the growth rates of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes originating from various latitudes and altitudes throughout the world. We also performed a genome-wide association study and a transcriptome study to identify single nucleic polymorphisms that were correlated with the relative growth rate (RGR) under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions or with CO<sub>2</sub> response of RGR. We then selected 43 candidate genes and generated their overexpression and/or RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic mutants for screening. After screening, we have found that RNAi lines of AT3G4000 and AT5G50900 showed significantly higher growth rates under the elevated CO<sub>2</sub> condition. As per our findings, we conclude that natural variation includes genetic variation associated with the enhancement of plant productivity under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.
