The availability of potassium is one of the main environmental factors for modifying the plasticity of root architecture. Many potassium channels and transporters are involved in regulating primary root growth in response to low potassium stress. NRT1.5/NPF7.3 transporter is a NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> cotransporter, and participates in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> translocation from the roots to the shoots. However, the underlying mechanism of NRT1.5-regulated primary root growth under low potassium stress is unclear. We show that NRT1.5/NPF7.3 inhibited primary root growth under low potassium conditions by regulating the accumulation of PIN2 protein and auxin levels. Under low potassium conditions, the mutants nrt1.5 and lks2 exhibited longer primary roots, longer meristem regions and elongation zones of primary roots, and more cell activity in the meristem region compared to WT plants, revealing the involvement of NRT1.5 in LK (low potassium)-inhibition primary root growth. In addition, exogenous auxin (IAA), auxin analogue (NAA, 2.4-D) or auxin precursor (IBA) promoted the primary root growth of WT and the complementation line NRT1.5 COM plants. In addition, the application of NPA inhibited the primary root growth of the nrt1.5 and lks2 mutants. Auxin accumulation was higher in the root tip of nrt1.5 plants than in WT plants, indicating that NRT1.5 regulates root growth inhibition by regulating auxin distribution. Furthermore, PIN2 was degraded more quickly in nrt1.5 plants under LK stress. Our findings reveal that NRT1.5 inhibits primary root growth by modulating the auxin level in the root tip via the degradation of PIN2.
