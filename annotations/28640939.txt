Seed development is an intricate process regulated via a complex transcriptional regulatory network. To understand the molecular mechanisms governing seed development and seed size/weight in chickpea, we performed a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome dynamics during seed development in two cultivars with contrasting seed size/weight (small-seeded, Himchana 1 and large-seeded, JGK 3). Our analysis identified stage-specific expression for a significant proportion (>13%) of the genes in each cultivar. About one half of the total genes exhibited significant differential expression in JGK 3 as compared with Himchana 1. We found that different seed development stages can be delineated by modules of coexpressed genes. A comparative analysis revealed differential developmental stage specificity of some modules between the two cultivars. Furthermore, we constructed transcriptional regulatory networks and identified key components determining seed size/weight. The results suggested that extended period of cell division during embryogenesis and higher level of endoreduplication along with more accumulation of storage compounds during maturation determine large seed size/weight. Further, we identified quantitative trait loci-associated candidate genes harboring single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter sequences that differentiate small- and large-seeded chickpea cultivars. The results provide a valuable resource to dissect the role of candidate genes governing seed development and seed size/weight in chickpea.
