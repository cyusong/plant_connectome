Bonacorsi et al. describe a new fossil from the Early Devonian that provides the earliest clear evidence for more advanced reproductive biology in land plants. The plant produced multiple spore size classes, which is an essential innovation necessary for all advanced plant reproductive strategies, including seeds and flowers.
