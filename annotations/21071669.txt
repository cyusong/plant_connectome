['21071669', 'During sexual reproduction in flowering plants such as Arabidopsis, a tip-growing  pollen tube (PT) is guided to the synergid cells of the female gametophyte, where  it bursts and releases the two sperm. Here we show that PT reception and powdery  mildew (PM) infection, which involves communication between a tip-growing hypha  and a plant epidermal cell, share molecular components. NORTIA (NTA), a member of  the MLO family originally discovered in the context of PM resistance, and FERONIA  (FER), a receptor-like kinase, both control PT reception in synergids. Homozygous  fer mutants also display PM resistance, revealing a new function for FER and  suggesting that conserved components, such as FER and distinct MLO proteins, are  involved in both PT reception and PM infection.', '2010 Nov 12', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1195211', 'Grossniklaus']
