The predicted doubling of global water usage by 2030 mean that stomatal behaviour is central to current efforts to increase photosynthesis and crop yields, particularly under conditions of reduced water availability. In the field, slow stomatal responses to dynamic environmental conditions add a temporal dimension to gaseous fluxes between the leaf and atmosphere. Here, we review recent work on the rapidity of stomatal responses and present some of the possible anatomical and biochemical mechanisms that influence the rapidity of stomatal movements.
