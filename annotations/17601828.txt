['17601828', 'Phenotypic characterization of the Arabidopsis thaliana transparent testa12  (tt12) mutant encoding a membrane protein of the multidrug and toxic efflux  transporter family, suggested that TT12 is involved in the vacuolar accumulation  of proanthocyanidin precursors in the seed. Metabolite analysis in tt12 seeds  reveals an absence of flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins together with a  reduction of the major flavonol quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside. The TT12 promoter is  active in cells synthesizing proanthocyanidins. Using translational fusions  between TT12 and green fluorescent protein, it is demonstrated that this  transporter localizes to the tonoplast. Yeast vesicles expressing TT12 can  transport the anthocyanin cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in the presence of MgATP but not  the aglycones cyanidin and epicatechin. Inhibitor studies demonstrate that TT12  acts in vitro as a cyanidin-3-O-glucoside/H(+)-antiporter. TT12 does not  transport glycosylated flavonols and procyanidin dimers, and a direct transport  activity for catechin-3-O-glucoside, a glucosylated flavan-3-ol, was not  detectable. However, catechin-3-O-glucoside inhibited TT12-mediated transport of  cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in a dose-dependent manner, while flavan-3-ol aglycones  and glycosylated flavonols had no effect on anthocyanin transport. It is proposed  that TT12 transports glycosylated flavan-3-ols in vivo. Mutant banyuls (ban)  seeds accumulate anthocyanins instead of proanthocyanidins, yet the ban tt12  double mutant exhibits reduced anthocyanin accumulation, which supports the  transport data suggesting that TT12 mediates anthocyanin transport in vitro.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.046029', 'Klein']
