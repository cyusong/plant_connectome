The SET domain-containing protein, pTAC14, was previously identified as a component of the transcriptionally active chromosome (TAC) complexes. Here, we investigated the function of pTAC14 in the regulation of plastid-encoded bacterial-type RNA polymerase (PEP) activity and chloroplast development. The knockout of pTAC14 led to the blockage of thylakoid formation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and ptac14 was seedling lethal. Sequence and transcriptional analysis showed that pTAC14 encodes a specific protein in plants that is located in the chloroplast associated with the thylakoid and that its expression depends on light. In addition, the transcript levels of all investigated PEP-dependent genes were clearly reduced in the ptac14-1 mutants, while the accumulation of nucleus-encoded phage-type RNA polymerase-dependent transcripts was increased, indicating an important role of pTAC14 in maintaining PEP activity. pTAC14 was found to interact with pTAC12/HEMERA, another component of TACs that is involved in phytochrome signaling. The data suggest that pTAC14 is essential for proper chloroplast development, most likely by affecting PEP activity and regulating PEP-dependent plastid gene transcription in Arabidopsis together with pTAC12.
