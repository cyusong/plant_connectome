Nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in plant diseases resistance. Here we have first time demonstrated that begomovirus infection in susceptible H. cannabinus plants, results in elevated NO and reactive nitrogen species production during early infection stage not only in infected leaf but also in root and shoot. Production of NO was further confirmed by oxyhemoglobin assay. Furthermore, we used Phenyl alanine ammonia lyase as marker of pathogenesis related enzyme. In addition evidence for protein tyrosine nitration during the early stage of viral infection clearly showed the involvement of nitrosative stress.

Begomovirus: !induces! NO production
NO: !induces! Reactive nitrogen species production
Phenyl alanine ammonia lyase: !serves as marker of! Pathogenesis related enzyme
Viral infection: !induces! Protein tyrosine nitration 
Nitrosative stress: !involves! NO
