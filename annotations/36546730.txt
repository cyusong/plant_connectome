Plants can exert remarkable capacity for cell reprogramming even from differentiated cells. This ability allows plants to regenerate tissues/organs and even individuals in nature and in vitro. In recent decades, Arabidopsis research has uncovered molecular mechanisms of plant regeneration; however, our understanding of how plant cells retain both differentiated status and developmental plasticity is still obscure. In this review, we first provide a brief outlook of the representative modes of plant regeneration and key factors revealed by Arabidopsis research. We then re-examine historical tissue culture systems that enable us to investigate the molecular details of cell reprogramming in differentiated cells and discuss the different approaches, specifically highlighting our recent progress in shoot regeneration from the epidermal cell of Torenia fournieri.
