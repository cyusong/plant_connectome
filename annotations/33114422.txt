Wheat is the most widely grown crop and represents the staple food for one third of the world's population. Wheat is attacked by a large variety of pathogens and the use of resistant cultivars is an effective and environmentally safe strategy for controlling diseases and eliminating the use of fungicides. In this study, a collection of wild and cultivated tetraploid wheats (<i>Triticum turgidum)</i> were evaluated for seedling resistance (SR) and adult plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew (<i>Blumeria graminis</i>) and genotyped with a 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to identify new sources of resistance genes. The genome-wide association mapping detected 18 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for APR and 8 QTL for SR, four of which were identical or at least closely linked to four QTL for APR. Thirteen candidate genes, containing nucleotide binding sites and leucine-rich repeats, were localized in the confidence intervals of the QTL-tagging SNPs. The marker IWB6155, associated to <i>QPm.mgb-1AS,</i> was located within the gene <i>TRITD1Av1G004560</i> coding for a disease resistance protein. While most of the identified QTL were described previously, five QTL for APR <i>(QPm.mgb-1AS, QPm.mgb-2BS, QPm.mgb-3BL.1, QPm.mgb-4BL, QPm.mgb-7BS.1)</i> and three QTL for SR (<i>QPm.mgb-3BL.3, QPm.mgb-5AL.2, QPm.mgb-7BS.2</i>) were mapped on chromosome regions where no resistance gene was reported before. The novel QTL/genes can contribute to enriching the resistance sources available to breeders.
