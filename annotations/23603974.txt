The involvement of chloride in salt stress symptoms and salt tolerance mechanisms in plants has been less investigated in the past. Therefore, we studied the salt-induced chloride influx in Arabidopsis expressing the GFP-based anion indicator Clomeleon. High salt concentrations induce two phases of chloride influx. The fast kinetic phase is likely caused by membrane depolarization, and is assumed to be mediated by channels. This is followed by a slower "saturation" phase, where chloride is accumulated in the cytoplasm. Both phases of chloride uptake are dependent on the presence of external calcium. In general: with high [Ca (2+)] less chloride is accumulated in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, also the internal calcium availability has an impact on chloride transport. A complete block of the second phase of chloride influx is achieved by the anion channel blocker A9C and trivalent cations (La (3+), Gd (3+), and Al (3+)). Other channel blockers and diuretics were found to inhibit the process partially. The results suggest that several transporter species are involved here, including electroneutral cation-chloride-cotransporters, and a part of chloride possibly enters the cells through cation channels after salt application.

Membrane depolarization: !induces! Fast kinetic phase 
External calcium: !affects! Chloride uptake 
Internal calcium: !impacts! Chloride transport 
Anion channel blocker A9C: !blocks! Second phase of chloride influx 
Trivalent cations: !inhibit! Process partially 
Cation-chloride-cotransporters: !involved in! Chloride transport 
Cation channels: !allow! Chloride to enter cells
