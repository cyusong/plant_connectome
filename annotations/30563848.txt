The maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) mutant <i>Unstable factor for orange1</i> (<i>Ufo1</i>) has been implicated in the epigenetic modifications of <i>pericarp color1</i> (<i>p1</i>), which regulates the production of the flavonoid pigments phlobaphenes. Here, we show that the <i>ufo1</i> gene maps to a genetically recalcitrant region near the centromere of chromosome 10. Transcriptome analysis of <i>Ufo1-1</i> mutant and wild-type plants identified a candidate gene in the mapping region using a comparative sequence-based approach. The candidate gene, GRMZM2G053177, is overexpressed by >45-fold in multiple tissues of <i>Ufo1-1</i>, explaining the dominance of <i>Ufo1-1</i> and its phenotypes. In the mutant stock, GRMZM2G053177 has a unique transcript originating within a CACTA transposon inserted in its first intron, and it is missing the first four codons of the wild-type transcript. GRMZM2G053177 expression is regulated by the DNA methylation status of the CACTA transposon, explaining the incomplete penetrance and poor expressivity of <i>Ufo1-1</i> Transgenic overexpression lines of GRMZM2G053177 (<i>Ufo1-1</i>) phenocopy the <i>p1</i>-induced pigmentation in coleoptiles, tassels, leaf sheaths, husks, pericarps, and cob glumes. Transcriptome analysis of <i>Ufo1</i> versus wild-type tissues revealed changes in several pathways related to abiotic and biotic stress. Thus, this study addresses the enigma of <i>Ufo1</i> identity in maize, which had gone unsolved for more than 50 years.
