During two vegetation periods, young clonal spruce trees (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) with sufficient and poor magnesium (Mg) supply were exposed in the environmental chambers of the GSF phytotron to three levels of ozone (daily means: 18-22, 88-130, and 135-190 microg m(-3); 10% reduction at night). Previous year's needles were examined at 4-week intervals with respect to their contents of Mg, Ca, K, Mn, N, P, and chlorophyll (Chl), various parameters of Chl fluorescence, and the stability of the isolated light-harvesting Chl-a/b-protein complex LHC II. The needles of the two nutrition variants contained more than 0.53 or less than 0.27mg Mg g(-1) needle dry matter, respectively. The ratio of variable to maximal Chl-a fluorescence of the dark-adapted needles, Fv/Fm, and the photoinhibitory quenching of Fv after light treatment, SVi.v, were affected by the Mg content of the needles rather than the ozone levels. Changes of the Chl content and the behavior of the LHC II allowed differentiating between a slow process of needle yellowing occurring under Mg deficiency only, and a rapid process of needle yellowing occurring under the combined action of Mg deficiency and ozone pollution. Only the rapid yellowing process was accompanied by destabilization of the LHC II, and the degree of destabilization was correlated with the ozone concentration present in the days before sampling. The results are consistent with observations obtained at a research site in the Central Black Forest (J Plant Physiol 161 (2004) 423).
