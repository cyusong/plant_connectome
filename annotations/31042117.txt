We have recently reported that <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE FLOWER (AGLF)</i> identifies the floral organ through regulating class C-function in <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. Here, we show that <i>AGLF</i> is not only involved in flower development but also the compound leaf formation. The <i>aglf</i> mutant exhibits the clustered leaflets, suggesting a trend towards the decreased leaf complexity. Similarly, the ortholog of <i>LEAFY</i> in <i>M. truncatula, SINGLE LEAFLET1</i> (<i>SGL1</i>), also plays critical roles in both flower and compound leaf development. However, the mutants of the ABC model genes downstream of <i>AGLF</i> and <i>SGL1</i> display the normal leaves. These data suggest that <i>AGLF</i> and <i>SGL1</i> regulate floral organ identity through ABC model, but are probably involved in other pathways to control compound leaf development.
