WRKY transcription factors have been suggested to play important roles in response and adaptation to drought stress. However, how sorghum WRKY transcription factors function in drought stress is still unclear. Here, we identify a WRKY transcription factor of sorghum, SbWRKY30, which is induced significantly by drought stress. SbWRKY30 is mainly expressed in sorghum taproot and leaf. SbWRKY30 has transcriptional activation activity and functions in the nucleus. Heterologous expression of SbWRKY30 confers tolerance to drought stress in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice by affecting root architecture. In addition, SbWRKY30 transgenic Arabidopsis and rice plants have higher proline contents and SOD, POD, and CAT activities but lower MDA contents than wild-type plants after drought stress. As a homologous gene of the drought stress-responsive gene RD19 of Arabidopsis, SbRD19 overexpression in Arabidopsis improved the drought tolerance of plants relative to wild-type plants. Further analysis demonstrated that SbWRKY30 could induce SbRD19 expression through binding to the W-box element in the promoter of SbRD19. These results suggest that SbWRKY30 functions as a positive regulator in response to drought stress. Therefore, SbWRKY30 may serve as a promising candidate gene for molecular breeding to generate drought-tolerant crops.
