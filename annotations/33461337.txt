Genus <i>Fusarium</i> (Ascomycota, Hypocreales, Nectriaceae) includes many economically important plant pathogens that cause devastating diseases of a wide range of crops and trees. Interestingly, there is increasing evidence that some <i>Fusarium</i> species also live as endophytes and benefit plant growth and stress tolerance. In this work, we sequence the whole genomes of endophytic <i>F. culmorum</i> and <i>F. pseudograminearum</i>, isolated from a coastal dunegrass (<i>Leymus mollis</i>), using long-read single-molecule real-time sequencing technology. Their genomes are assembled into four chromosomes and a mitochondrial genome with a total assembly size of 40.05 and 42.90 M, respectively. This resource should not only facilitate functional studies designed to better understand what makes the two <i>Fusarium</i> species such successful plant-beneficial fungi but should also reveal their genome evolution and adaptation.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
