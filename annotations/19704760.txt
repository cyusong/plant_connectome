Reactive oxygen species (ROS) fulfil many functions in plants. They have a signaling role in several physiological mechanisms, but they are also directly involved as substrates in important reactions, especially in the apoplast. Two ROS, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, were shown to exhibit a typical accumulation pattern in the Arabidopsis root apex. While hydrogen peroxide is mainly present in the cell wall of fully elongated cells in the region of root hair formation, superoxide accumulation roughly coincides with the transition zone, between the meristem and the fast elongating zone. Developing lateral roots also exhibit a strong superoxide labeling with the same localization.
