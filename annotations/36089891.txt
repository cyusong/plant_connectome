Gravity is one of the fundamental environmental cues that affect plant development. Indeed, the plant architecture in the shoots and roots is modulated by gravity. Stems grow vertically upward, whereas lateral organs, such as the lateral branches in shoots, tend to grow at a specific angle according to a gravity vector known as the gravitropic setpoint angle (GSA). During this process, gravity is sensed in specialised gravity-sensing cells named statocytes, which convert gravity information into biochemical signals, leading to asymmetric auxin distribution and driving asymmetric cell division/expansion in the organs to achieve gravitropism. As a hypothetical offset mechanism against gravitropism to determine the GSA, the anti-gravitropic offset (AGO) has been proposed. According to this concept, the GSA is a balance of two antagonistic growth components, that is gravitropism and the AGO. Although the nature of the AGO has not been clarified, studies have suggested that gravitropism and the AGO share a common gravity-sensing mechanism in statocytes. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying gravitropism as well as the hypothetical AGO in the control of the GSA.
