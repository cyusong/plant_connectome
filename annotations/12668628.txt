['12668628', 'The molecular mechanisms that control the ordered patterning of vascular tissue  development in plants are not well understood. Several models propose a  two-component system for vascular differentiation. These components include an  inducer of vascular tissue development and an inhibitor that prevents the  formation of vascular bundles near pre-existing bundles. We have identified two  recessive allelic mutants in Arabidopsis, designated continuous vascular ring  (cov1), that display a dramatic increase in vascular tissue development in the  stem in place of the interfascicular region that normally separates the vascular  bundles. The mutant plants exhibited relatively normal vascular patterning in  leaves and cotyledons. Analysis of the interaction of cov1 with a known auxin  signalling mutant and direct analysis of auxin concentrations suggests that cov1  affects vascular pattering by some mechanism that is independent of auxin. The  COV1 protein is predicted to be an integral membrane protein of unknown function,  highly conserved between plants and bacteria. In plants, COV1 is likely to be  involved in a mechanism that negatively regulates the differentiation of vascular  tissue in the stem.', '2003 May', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.00441', 'Turner']
