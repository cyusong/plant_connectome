Leaf hydraulic conductance (K<sub>leaf</sub> ) and mesophyll conductance (g<sub>m</sub> ) both represent major constraints to photosynthetic rate (A), and previous studies have suggested that K<sub>leaf</sub> and g<sub>m</sub> is correlated in leaves. However, there is scarce empirical information about their correlation. In this study, K<sub>leaf</sub> , leaf hydraulic conductance inside xylem (K<sub>x</sub> ), leaf hydraulic conductance outside xylem (K<sub>ox</sub> ), A, stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub> ), g<sub>m</sub> , and anatomical and structural leaf traits in 11 Oryza genotypes were investigated to elucidate the correlation of H<sub>2</sub> O and CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion inside leaves. All of the leaf functional and anatomical traits varied significantly among genotypes. K<sub>leaf</sub> was not correlated with the maximum theoretical stomatal conductance calculated from stomatal dimensions (g<sub>smax</sub> ), and neither g<sub>s</sub> nor g<sub>smax</sub> were correlated with K<sub>x</sub> . Moreover, K<sub>ox</sub> was linearly correlated with g<sub>m</sub> and both were closely related to mesophyll structural traits. These results suggest that K<sub>leaf</sub> and g<sub>m</sub> are related to leaf anatomical and structural features, which may explain the mechanism for correlation between g<sub>m</sub> and K<sub>leaf</sub> .
