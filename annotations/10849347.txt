['10849347', 'Variegated plants have green- and white-sectored leaves. Cells in the green  sectors contain morphologically normal chloroplasts, whereas cells in the white  sectors contain non-pigmented plastids that lack organized lamellar structures.  Many variegations are caused by mutations in nuclear genes that affect plastid  function, yet in only a few cases have the responsible genes been cloned. We show  that mutations in the nuclear VAR2 locus of Arabidopsis cause variegation due to  loss of a chloroplast thylakoid membrane protein that bears similarity to the  FtsH family of AAA proteins (ATPases associated with diverse cellular  activities). Escherichia coli FtsH is a chaperone metalloprotease that functions  in a number of diverse membrane-associated events. Although FtsH homologs have  been identified in multicellular organisms, their functions and activities are  largely unknown; we provide genetic in vivo evidence that VAR2 functions in  thylakoid membrane biogenesis. We have isolated four var2 alleles and they have  allowed us to define domains of the protein that are required for activity. These  include two putative ATP-binding sites. VAR2 protein amounts generally correlate  with the severity of the var2 mutant phenotype. One allele lacks detectable VAR2  protein, suggesting that the mechanism of var2 variegation involves the action of  a redundant activity in the green sectors. We conclude that redundant activities  may be a general mechanism to explain nuclear gene-induced plant variegations.', '2000 May', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00738.x', 'Rodermel']
