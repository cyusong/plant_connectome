Head smut, caused by the fungal pathogen Sporisorium reilianum, poses a threat to maize production worldwide. ZmWAK, a cell wall-associated receptor kinase, confers quantitative resistance to head smut disease. Here, two near-isogenic lines (NILs), susceptible line Huangzao4 and its ZmWAK-converted resistant line Huangzao4R, were used to decipher the role of ZmWAK in head smut resistance. Cytological and molecular characterization in response to S. reilianum infection was compared between two NILs. Upon S. reilianum infection, the growth of pathogen hyphae was severely arrested in the ZmWAK-converted resistant line Huangzao4R, relative to its susceptible parental line Huangzao4. Infected cells exhibited apoptosis-like features in Huangzao4R and hyphae were sequestered within dead cells, whereas pathogen invasion caused autophagy in Huangzao4, which failed to prevent hyphal spreading. Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis indicated that ZmWAK functions as a hub in the trade-off between growth and defense, whereby ZmWAK promotes cell growth in the absence of the pathogen and switches to a defense response upon S. reilianum attack. These findings shed light on an elegant regulatory mechanism governed by ZmWAK in the trade-off between growth and head smut defense.
