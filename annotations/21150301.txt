Plants respond to developmental cues and environmental stresses by controlling both the level and activity of various hormones. One mechanism of modulating hormone action involves amino acid conjugation. In plants, the GH3 family of enzymes conjugates various amino acids to jasmonates, auxins, and benzoates. The effect of conjugation can lead to activation, inactivation, or degradation of these molecules. Although the acyl acid and amino acid specificities of a few GH3 enzymes have been examined qualitatively, further in-depth analysis of the structure and function of these proteins is needed to reveal the molecular basis for how GH3 proteins modulate plant hormone action.

GH3: !conjugates! amino acids 
amino acids: !modulate! hormone action 
GH3: !activates! jasmonates 
GH3: !inactivates! auxins 
GH3: !degrades! benzoates
