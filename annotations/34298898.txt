The aim was to study the inhibitory effects of coumarin derivatives on the plant pathogenic fungi, as well as beneficial bacteria and nematodes. The antifungal assay was performed on four cultures of phytopathogenic fungi by measuring the radial growth of the fungal colonies. Antibacterial activity was determined by the broth microdilution method performed on two beneficial soil organisms. Nematicidal activity was tested on two entomopathogenic nematodes. The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was generated by genetic algorithm, and toxicity was estimated by T.E.S.T. software. The mode of inhibition of enzymes related to the antifungal activity is elucidated by molecular docking. Coumarin derivatives were most effective against <i>Macrophomina phaseolina</i> and <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>, but were not harmful against beneficial nematodes and bacteria. A predictive QSAR model was obtained for the activity against <i>M. phaseolina</i> (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i><sub>tr</sub></i> = 0.78; <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i><sub>ext</sub></i> = 0.67; <i>Q</i><sup>2</sup><i><sub>loo</sub></i> = 0.67). A QSAR study showed that multiple electron-withdrawal groups, especially at position C-3, enhanced activities against <i>M. phaseolina</i>, while the hydrophobic benzoyl group at the pyrone ring, and -Br, -OH, -OCH<sub>3</sub>, at the benzene ring, may increase inhibition of <i>S. sclerotiourum</i>. Tested compounds possibly act inhibitory against plant wall-degrading enzymes, proteinase K. Coumarin derivatives are the potentially active ingredient of environmentally friendly plant-protection products.
