['14551326', 'The gene PRT1 of Arabidopsis, encoding a 45-kD protein with two RING finger  domains, is essential for the degradation of F-dihydrofolate reductase, a model  substrate of the N-end rule pathway of protein degradation. We have determined  the function of PRT1 by expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). PRT1 can  act as a ubiquitin protein ligase in the heterologous host. The identified  substrates of PRT1 have an aromatic residue at their amino-terminus, indicating  that PRT1 mediates degradation of N-end rule substrates with aromatic termini but  not of those with aliphatic or basic amino-termini. Expression of model  substrates in mutant and wild-type plants confirmed this substrate specificity. A  ligase activity exclusively devoted to aromatic amino-termini of the N-end rule  pathway is apparently unique to plants. The results presented also imply that  other known substrates of the plant N-end rule pathway are ubiquitylated by one  or more different ubiquitin protein ligases.', '2003 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.029272', 'Bachmair']
