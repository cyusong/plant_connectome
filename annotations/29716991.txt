Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates plant stress responses and development. However, how the ABA signal is transmitted in response to stresses remains largely unclear, especially in monocots. In this study, we found that rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) OsPM1 (PLASMA MEMBRANE PROTEIN1), encoded by a gene of AWPM-19 like family, mediates ABA influx through the plasma membrane. <i>OsPM1</i> is predominantly expressed in vascular tissues, guard cells, and mature embryos. Phenotypic analysis of overexpression, RNA interference (RNAi), and knockout (KO) lines showed that OsPM1 is involved in drought responses and seed germination regulation. <sup>3</sup>H-(±)ABA transport activity and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays both demonstrated that OsPM1 facilitates ABA uptake into cells. The physiological isomer of ABA, (+)-ABA, is the preferred substrate of OsPM1. Higher ABA accumulation and faster stomatal closure in response to ABA treatment were observed in the overexpression lines compared with the wild-type control. Many ABA-responsive genes were upregulated more in the <i>OsPM1</i>-overexpression lines but less in the RNAi lines compared with wild-type plants. Further investigation revealed that <i>OsPM1</i> expression is regulated by the AREB/ABF family transcription factor OsbZIP46. Our results thus revealed that OsPM1 is an ABA influx carrier that plays an important role in drought responses.
