['22927420', 'The spatial coordination of growth is of central importance for the regulation of  plant tissue architecture. Individual layers, such as the epidermis, are clonally  propagated and structurally maintained by symmetric cell divisions that are  oriented along the plane of the layer. The developmental control of this process  is poorly understood. The simple cellular basis and sheet-like structure of  Arabidopsis integuments make them an attractive model system to address planar  growth. Here we report on the characterization of the Arabidopsis UNICORN (UCN)  gene. Analysis of ucn integuments reveals localized distortion of planar growth,  eventually resulting in an ectopic multicellular protrusion. In addition, ucn  mutants exhibit ectopic growth in filaments and petals, as well as aberrant  embryogenesis. We further show that UCN encodes an active AGC VIII kinase.  Genetic, biochemical, and cell biological data suggest that UCN suppresses  ectopic growth in integuments by directly repressing the KANADI transcription  factor ABERRANT TESTA SHAPE. Our findings indicate that UCN represents a unique  plant growth regulator that maintains planar growth of integuments by repressing  a developmental regulator involved in the control of early integument growth and  polarity.', '2012 Sep 11', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1205089109', 'Schneitz']
