Regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level is of crucial importance in the development of an organism. Here we present the characterization of a maize gene, U6 biogenesis-like 1 (UBL1), which plays an important role in kernel and seedling development by influencing pre-mRNA splicing. The ubl1 mutant, exhibiting small kernel and weak seedling, was isolated from a Mutator-tagged population. Transgenic complementation and three independent mutant alleles confirmed that UBL1, which encodes a putative RNA exonuclease belonging to the 2H phosphodiesterase superfamily, is responsible for the phenotype of ubl1. We demonstrated that UBL1 possess the RNA exonuclease activity in vitro and found that loss of UBL1 function in ubl1 causes decreased level and abnormal 3' end constitution of snRNA U6, resulting in splicing defect of mRNAs. Through the in vitro and in vivo studies replacing two histidines with alanines in the H-X-T/S-X (X is a hydrophobic residue) motifs we demonstrated that these two motifs are essential for the normal function of UBL1. We further showed that the function of UBL1 may be conserved across a wide phylogenetic distance as the heterologous expression of maize UBL1 could complement the Arabidopsis ubl1 mutant.
