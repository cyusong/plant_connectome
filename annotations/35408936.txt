Melatonin (MT), as a signaling molecule, plays a vital role in regulating leaf senescence in plants. This study aimed to verify the antioxidant roles of MT in delaying dark- or age-induced leaf senescence of cucumber plants. The results showed that endogenous MT responds to darkness and overexpression of <i>CsASMT</i>, the key gene of MT synthesis, and delays leaf senescence stimulated by darkness, as manifested by significantly lower malonaldehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents as well as higher activities and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes compared to the control. Moreover, MT suppressed both age- or dark-induced leaf senescence of cucumber, as evidenced by a decrease in senescence-related gene <i>SAG20</i> and cell-death-related gene <i>PDCD</i> expression and ROS content and an increase in antioxidant capacity and chlorophyll biosynthesis compared with the H<sub>2</sub>O-treated seedlings. Meanwhile, the suppression of age-induced leaf senescence by melatonin was also reflected by the reduction in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and signaling pathways as well as the promotion of auxin (IAA) biosynthesis and signaling pathways in cucumber plants in the solar greenhouse. Combining the results of the two separate experiments, we demonstrated that MT acts as a powerful antioxidant to alleviate leaf senescence by activating the antioxidant system and IAA synthesis and signaling while inhibiting ABA synthesis and signaling in cucumber plants.
