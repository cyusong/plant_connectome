Light-dependent oxygen reduction in the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, i.e. the Mehler reaction, has been studied using isolated pea thylakoids. The role of the plastoquinone pool in the Mehler reaction was investigated in the presence of dinitrophenyl ether of 2-iodo-4-nitrothymol (DNP-INT), the inhibitor of plastohydroquinone oxidation by cytochrome b6/f complex. Oxygen reduction rate in the presence of DNP-INT was higher than in the absence of the inhibitor in low light at pH 6.5 and 7.6, showing that the capacity of the plastoquinone pool to reduce molecular oxygen in this case exceeded that of the entire electron transfer chain. In the presence of DNP-INT, appearance of superoxide anion radicals outside thylakoid membrane represented approximately 60% of the total superoxide anion radicals produced. The remaining 40% of the produced superoxide anion radicals was suggested to be trapped by plastohydroquinone molecules within thylakoid membrane, leading to the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ). To validate the reaction of superoxide anion radical with plastohydroquinone, xanthine/xanthine oxidase system was integrated with thylakoid membrane in order to generate superoxide anion radical in close vicinity of plastohydroquinone. Addition of xanthine/xanthine oxidase to the thylakoid suspension resulted in a decrease in the reduction level of the plastoquinone pool in the light. The obtained data provide additional clarification of the aspects that the plastoquinone pool is involved in both reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion radicals and reduction of superoxide anion radicals to H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> . Significance of the plastoquinone pool involvement in the Mehler reaction for the acclimation of plants to light conditions is discussed.
