Organogenesis at the shoot meristem requires a delicate balance between stem cell specification and differentiation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, WUSCHEL (WUS) is a key factor promoting stem cell identity, whereas the CLAVATA (CLV1, CLV2, and CLV3) loci appear to promote differentiation by repressing WUS expression. In a screen for mutations modifying clv1 mutants, we have identified a novel regulator of meristem development we term CORONA (CNA). Whereas cna single mutant plants exhibit subtle defects in meristem development, clv cna double mutants develop massively enlarged apices that display early loss of organogenesis, misexpression of WUS and CLV3, and eventual differentiation of the entire apex. The CNA gene was isolated by positional cloning and found to encode a class III homeodomain Leu zipper protein. A missense mutation resulting in the dominant-negative cna-1 allele was identified in a conserved domain of unknown function, and a likely null allele was shown to display a similar but weaker phenotype. CNA is expressed in developing vascular tissue, diffusely through shoot and flower meristems, and within developing stamens and carpels. Our analysis of WUS expression in wild-type, clv, and clv cna plants revealed that, contrary to current models, WUS is neither necessary nor sufficient for stem cell specification and that neither WUS nor CLV3 is a marker for stem cell identity. We propose that CNA functions in parallel to the CLV loci to promote organ formation.
