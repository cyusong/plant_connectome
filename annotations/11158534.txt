['11158534', 'A recessive mutation of Arabidopsis designated sas1 (for sodium overaccumulation  in shoot) that was mapped to the bottom of chromosome III resulted in a two- to  sevenfold overaccumulation of Na(+) in shoots compared with wild-type plants.  sas1 is a pleiotropic mutation that also caused severe growth reduction. The  impact of NaCl stress on growth was similar for sas1 and wild-type plants;  however, with regard to survival, sas1 plants displayed increased sensitivity to  NaCl and LiCl treatments compared with wild-type plants. sas1 mutants  overaccumulated Na(+) and its toxic structural analog Li(+), but not K(+),  Mg(2)+, or Ca(2)+. Sodium accumulated preferentially over K(+) in a similar  manner for sas1 and wild-type plants. Sodium overaccumulation occurred in all of  the aerial organs of intact sas1 plants but not in roots. Sodium-treated leaf  fragments or calli displayed similar Na(+) accumulation levels for sas1 and  wild-type tissues. This suggested that the sas1 mutation impaired Na(+)  long-distance transport from roots to shoots. The transpiration stream was  similar in sas1 and wild-type plants, whereas the Na(+) concentration in the  xylem sap of sas1 plants was 5.5-fold higher than that of wild-type plants. These  results suggest that the sas1 mutation disrupts control of the radial transport  of Na(+) from the soil solution to the xylem vessels.', '2001 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.13.1.125', 'Berthomieu']
