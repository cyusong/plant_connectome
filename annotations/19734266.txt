['19734266', 'In eukaryotes, alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs contributes significantly to the  proper expression of the genome. However, the functions of many auxiliary  spliceosomal proteins are still unknown. Here, we functionally characterized  plant homologues of nematode suppressors of mec-8 and unc-52 (smu). We compared  transcript profiles of maize (Zea mays) smu2 endosperm with those of wild-type  plants and identified pre-mRNA splicing events that depend on the maize SMU2  protein. Consistent with a conserved role of plant SMU-2 homologues, Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) smu2 mutants also show altered splicing of similar target  pre-mRNAs. The Atsmu2 mutants occasionally show developmental phenotypes,  including abnormal cotyledon numbers and higher seed weights. We identified  AtSMU1 as one of the SMU2-interacting proteins, and Atsmu1 mutations cause  similar developmental phenotypes with higher penetrance than Atsmu2. The AtSMU2  and AtSMU1 proteins are localized to the nucleus and highly prevalent in actively  dividing tissues. Taken together, our data indicated that the plant SMU-1 and  SMU-2 homologues appear to be involved in splicing of specific pre-mRNAs that  affect multiple aspects of development.', '2009 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.141705', 'Larkins']
