Ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-320 nm) radiation may have severe negative effects on plants including damage to their genetic information. UV protection and DNA-repair mechanisms have evolved to either avoid or repair such damage. Since autotrophic plants are dependent on sunlight for their energy supply, an increase in the amount of UV-B reaching the earth's surface may affect the integrity of their genetic information if DNA damage is not repaired efficiently and rapidly. Here we show that overexpression of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase (EC 4.1.99.3) in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.), which catalyses the reversion of the major UV-B photoproduct in DNA (CPDs), strongly enhances the repair of CPDs and results in a moderate increase of biomass production under elevated UV-B.
