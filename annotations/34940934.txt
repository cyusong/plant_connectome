The free bases of cytokinins are the biologically active forms of the hormone while cytokinin ribosides become active only upon removal of the ribose residue. Cytokinins (CKs) belong to the classical plant hormones. They were discovered more than 65 years ago, but which molecular forms possess genuine CK activity is still matter of debate. Numerous studies support the view that only the free bases are the biologically active molecules. This standpoint has been challenged in a recent review (Nguyen et al. in Planta 254: 45, 2021) proposing that also CK ribosides may have genuine own CK activity. Here we critically discuss the pros and cons of this viewpoint considering the results of biological assays, CK binding studies, 3D structural data of CK-receptor interaction and mutant analyses. It is concluded that all types of study provide clear and convincing evidence only for biological activity of free bases and not ribosides; the latter are rather a transport form of the hormone without their own biological activity.

Biological assays: !support view that only free bases are active molecules! 
CK binding studies: !provide evidence only for biological activity of free bases! 
3D structural data: !support evidence only for biological activity of free bases! 
Mutant analyses: !support evidence only for biological activity of free bases!
