Mosses are widely used in the establishment of greenery. However, little research has been conducted to choose a suitable species or improve their performance for this application. In our study, we examined <i>Vesicularia montagnei</i> (<i>V. montagnei</i>), a robust moss that is widely distributed in temperate, subtropical, and tropical Asia with varying environmental conditions. Axenic cultivation system of <i>V. montagnei</i> was developed on modified BCD medium, which enabled its propagation and multiplication <i>in vitro</i>. In this axenic cultivation environment, several diploid <i>V. montagnei</i> lines with enhancement of rhizoid system were generated through artificial induction of diploidization. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that several genes responsible for jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signaling showed significant higher expression levels in the diploid lines compared to the wild type. These results are consistent with the increasement of JA content in the diploid lines. Our establishment of the axenic cultivation method may provide useful information for further study of other <i>Vesicularia</i> species. The diploid <i>V. montagnei</i> lines with improved rhizoid system may hold promising potential for greenery applications. Additionally, our study sheds light on the biosynthesis and functions of JA in the early landed plants.
