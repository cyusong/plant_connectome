['23515225', 'Membrane fusion is mediated by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor  attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. Although membrane fusion is  required for separating daughter cells in eukaryotic cytokinesis, the SNARE  complexes involved are not known. In plants, membrane vesicles targeted to the  cell division plane fuse with one another to form the partitioning membrane,  progressing from the center to the periphery of the cell. In Arabidopsis, the  cytokinesis-specific Qa-SNARE KNOLLE interacts with two other Q-SNAREs, SNAP33  and novel plant-specific SNARE 11 (NPSN11), whose roles in cytokinesis are not  clear. Here we show by coimmunoprecipitation that KNOLLE forms two SNARE  complexes that differ in composition. One complex is modeled on the trimeric  plasma membrane type of SNARE complex and includes, in addition to KNOLLE, the  promiscuous Qb,c-SNARE SNAP33 and the R-SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein  (VAMP) 721,722, also involved in innate immunity. In contrast, the other  KNOLLE-containing complex is tetrameric and includes Qb-SNARE NPSN11, Qc-SNARE  SYP71, and VAMP721,722. Elimination of only one or the other type of KNOLLE  complex by mutation, including the double mutant npsn11 syp71, causes a mild or  no cytokinesis defect. In contrast, the two double mutants snap33 npsn11 and  snap33 syp71 eliminate both types of KNOLLE complexes and display knolle-like  cytokinesis defects. Thus the two distinct types of KNOLLE complexes appear to  jointly mediate membrane fusion in Arabidopsis cytokinesis.', '2013 May', 'Mol Biol Cell', '10.1091/mbc.E13-02-0074', 'Jurgens']
