['28148225', 'BACKGROUND: Microtubules (MTs) are polarized polymers with highly dynamic plus  ends that stochastically switch between growth and shrinkage phases. In  eukaryotic cells, a plethora of MT-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate the  dynamics and higher-order organization of MTs to mediate distinct cellular  functions. Plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) are a group of MAPs that  specifically accumulate at the growing MT plus ends, where they modulate the  behavior of the MT plus ends and mediate interactions with cellular targets.  Although several functionally important + TIP proteins have been characterized in  yeast and animals, little is known about this group of proteins in plants.  RESULTS: We report here that two homologous MAPs from Arabidopsis thaliana,  Growing Plus-end Tracking 1 (GPT1) and GPT2 (henceforth GPT1/2), contain basic  MT-binding regions at their central and C-terminal regions, and bind directly to  MTs in vitro. Interestingly, GPT1/2 preferentially accumulated at the growing  plus ends of cortical MTs in interphase Arabidopsis cells. When the  GPT1/12-decorated growing plus ends switched to rapid depolymerization, GPT1/2  dissociated from the MT plus ends. Conversely, when the depolymerizing ends were  rescued and started to polymerize again, GPT1/2 were immediately recruited to the  growing MT tips. This tip tracking behavior of GPT proteins does not depend on  the two established plant + TIPs, End-Binding protein 1 (EB1) and SPIRAL1 (SPR1).  CONCLUSIONS: The Arabidopsis MAPs GPT1 and GPT2 bind MTs directly through their  basic regions. These MAPs track the plus ends of growing MTs independently of EB1  and SPR1 and represent a novel plant-specific + TIP family.', '2017 Feb 2', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/s12870-017-0987-5', 'ORCID:']
