Medicago truncatula and Sinorhizobium meliloti form a symbiotic association resulting in the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules. In this organ, symbiotic cells contain large numbers of bacteroids. Remarkably, this chronic infection does not trigger visible defense reactions. Despite the importance of this phenomenon for potential transfer of the symbiotic capacity to non-legume plants, the molecular mechanisms underlying this tolerance are not understood. We have characterized the dnf2 M. truncatula mutant blocked in the symbiotic process after bacterial infection of the symbiotic cells. Nodules formed by the mutant contain only few layers of infected cells. Furthermore, they exhibit defense-like reactions which clearly contrast with premature senescence frequently observed during inefficient symbioses. This atypical phenotype raises DNF2 as an exciting starting point to investigate the molecular basis of symbiotic repression of plant defenses.
