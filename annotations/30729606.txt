['30729606', 'Waxes are components of the cuticle covering the aerial organs of plants.  Accumulation of waxes has previously been associated with protection against  water loss, therefore contributing to drought tolerance. However, not much  information is known about the function of individual wax components during water  deficit. We studied the role of wax ester synthesis during drought. The wax ester  load on Arabidopsis leaves and stems was increased during water deficiency.  Expression of three genes, WSD1, WSD6 and WSD7 of the wax ester  synthase/diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT or WSD) family was induced  during drought, salt stress and abscisic acid treatment. WSD1 has previously been  identified as the major wax ester synthase of stems. wsd1 mutants have shown  reduced wax ester coverage on leaves and stems during normal or drought  condition, while wax ester loads of wsd6, wsd7 and of the wsd6wsd7 double mutant  were unchanged. The growth and relative water content of wsd1 plants were  compromised during drought, while leaf water loss of wsd1 was increased. Enzyme  assays with recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells revealed that WSD6 and  WSD7 contain wax ester synthase activity, albeit with different substrate  specificity compared with WSD1. WSD6 and WSD7 localize to the endoplasmic  reticulum (ER)/Golgi. These results demonstrated that WSD1 is involved in the  accumulation of wax esters during drought, while WSD6 and WSD7 might play other  specific roles in wax ester metabolism during stress.', '2019 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14269', 'Dormann']
