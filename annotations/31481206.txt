['31481206', 'In plants, sugar acts as an essential signaling molecule that modulates various  aspects of metabolism, growth and development, which are also controlled by  phytohormones. However, the molecular mechanism of cross-talk between sugar and  phytohormones still remains to be elucidated. We have identified gsm1  (glucose-hypersensitive mutant 1) as a mutant with impaired cotyledon development  that shows sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). The addition of  fluridone can reverse the glucose (Glc) inhibitory effect in gsm1, implying that  endogenous ABA is involved in the Glc response of gsm1. In 4.5% Glc, the  expression of Glc-induced ABA-responsive genes in gsm1-1 was nearly two times  higher than that in the wild type. Compared to gsm1-1, the gsm1-1 abi4-1 double  mutant exhibited reduced sensitivity to Glc and ABA, which was similar to the Glc  and ABA insensitive phenotype of abi4-1, suggesting that ABI4 is epistatic to  GSM1. In the treatment with 4.5% Glc, the GSM1 transcript level was greatly  increased in abi4-1 by almost 4-fold of that in the wild type. These data suggest  that GSM1 plays an important role in the ABI4-regulated Glc-ABA signaling cascade  during Arabidopsis early seedling growth.', '2019 Oct', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.110183', 'Hsu']
