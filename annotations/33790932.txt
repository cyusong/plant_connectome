Saffron (<i>Crocus sativus</i> L.) is an expensive spice crop cultivated successfully in Iran, Afghanistan, India, Greece, Morocco, Spain, and Italy. The present study was conducted during the periods 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 to evaluate the morphological, yield and quality parameters of saffron in six different regions of non-traditional areas of the western Himalayas. The two experimental factors were "year" and "location." The experiment was conducted using a factorial randomized block design with three replications. Yield attributes, <i>viz.</i>, number of flowers, fresh flower yield, fresh stigma yield and dry stigma yield were significantly higher in location L<sub>3</sub> compared to other geographical locations. Dry stigma yield in location L<sub>3</sub> was higher by 50.0, 41.2, 33.3, 14.3, and 9.1% compared to locations L<sub>6</sub>, L<sub>5</sub>, L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>4</sub>, and L<sub>2</sub>, respectively. These were characterized by the appropriate climatic conditions, <i>viz.</i>, high altitude, sandy-loam texture of the soil, optimum temperature, lesser relative humidity and total rainfall, demonstrating that it is possible to cultivate this spice even in non-traditional areas of the western Himalaya. Positive correlations were established for stigma yield with increased altitude and lesser rainfall. Secondary metabolites <i>viz.</i>, crocin and picrocrocin increased significantly with the increase in altitude; however, a reverse trend was recorded for safranal content. Total phenolics and flavonoids were significantly higher in the geographical location of Kinnaur, H.P. (L<sub>1</sub>) and Bharmour, H.P. (L<sub>4</sub>). In conclusion, the assessment of different geographical locations and soil types is particularly necessary to encourage saffron production and its qualitative traits. Based on current findings, saffron can be grown successfully in some non-traditional locations of the western Himalayan regions.
