CLAVATA pathway is one of best-characterized signaling pathway involves in the regulation of meristem development in Arabidopsis. Increasing evidence indicated that this pathway also exist in the monocots as well as in the dicots. We have recently identified FON4 in rice as an ortholog of CLV3 in Arabidopsis. FON4 is putative ligand of FON1, which play a role in restricting the meristem size in rice. FON4 and CLV3 are the members of CLE gene family, which encode small functional secreted peptide with a conserved 14-amino acid motif (CLE motif) near or at the C termini.
