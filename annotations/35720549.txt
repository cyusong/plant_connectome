To feed the fast growing global population with sufficient food using limited global resources, it is urgent to develop and utilize cutting-edge technologies and improve efficiency of agricultural production. In this review, we specifically introduce the concepts, theories, methods, applications and future implications of association studies and predicting unknown genetic value or future phenotypic events using genomics in the area of breeding in agriculture. Genome wide association studies can identify the quantitative genetic loci associated with phenotypes of importance in agriculture, while genomic prediction utilizes individual genetic value to rank selection candidates to improve the next generation of plants or animals. These technologies and methods have improved the efficiency of genetic improvement programs for agricultural production <i>via</i> elite animal breeds and plant varieties. With the development of new data acquisition technologies, there will be more and more data collected from high-through-put technologies to assist agricultural breeding. It will be crucial to extract useful information among these large amounts of data and to face this challenge, more efficient algorithms need to be developed and utilized for analyzing these data. Such development will require knowledge from multiple disciplines of research.
