Melatonin (MEL) is a pleiotropic agent with crucial functions reported in a variety of stress responses and developmental processes. Although MEL involvement in plant defense against natural leaf senescence has been widely reported, the precise regulatory mechanisms by which it delays stress-induced senescence remain unclear. In this study, we found that foliar spraying of melatonin markedly ameliorated dehydration-induced leaf senescence in <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>, accompanied by attenuated oxidative damage, expression of senescence-related genes, and reduced endogenous ABA production. Metabolite profiling indicated that melatonin-treated plants accumulated higher concentrations of sugars, sugar alcohol, and organic acids, but fewer concentrations of amino acids in the leaves, than untreated plants after exposure to dehydration. Gene expression analysis revealed that the delayed senescence of stressed plants achieved by melatonin treatment might be partially ascribed to the upregulated expression of genes involved in ROS scavenging, chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and carbon/nitrogen balances, and downregulated expression of senescence-associated genes. Furthermore, hormone responses showed an extensively modulated expression, complemented by carotenoid biosynthesis regulation to achieve growth acceleration in melatonin-treated plants upon exposure to dehydration stress. These findings may provide more comprehensive insights into the role of melatonin in alleviating leaf senescence and enhancing dehydration resistance.
