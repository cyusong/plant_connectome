Globally, maize is an important cereal food crop with the highest production and productivity. Among the biotic constraints that limit the productivity of maize, the recent invasion of fall armyworm (FAW) in India is a concern. The first line of strategy available for FAW management is to evaluate and exploit resistant genotypes for inclusion in an IPM schedule. Screening for resistant maize genotypes against FAW is in its infancy in India, considering its recent occurrence in the country. The present work attempts to optimize screening techniques suited to Indian conditions, which involve the description of leaf damage rating (LDR) by comparing injury levels among maize genotypes and to validate the result obtained from the optimized screening technique by identification of lines potentially resistant to FAW under artificial infestation. Exposure to 20 neonate FAW larvae at the V<sub>5</sub> phenological stage coupled with the adoption of LDR on a 1-9 scale aided in preliminary characterize maize genotypes as potentially resistant, moderately resistant, and susceptible. The LDR varies with genotype, neonate counts, and days after infestation. The genotypes, <i>viz</i>., DMRE 63, DML-163-1, CML 71, CML 141, CML 337, CML 346, and wild ancestor <i>Zea mays</i> ssp. <i>parviglumis</i> recorded lower LDR ratings against FAW and can be exploited for resistance breeding in maize.
