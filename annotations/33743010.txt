The plant hormone ethylene is important for the ripening of climacteric fruit, such as pear (Pyrus ussuriensis), and the brassinosteroid (BR) class of phytohormones affects ethylene biosynthesis during ripening via an unknown molecular mechanism. Here, we observed that exogenous BR treatment suppressed ethylene production and delayed fruit ripening, whereas treatment with a BR biosynthesis inhibitor promoted ethylene production and accelerated fruit ripening in pear, suggesting BR is a ripening suppressor. The expression of the transcription factor BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1PuBZR1 was enhanced by BR treatment during pear fruit ripening. PuBZR1 interacted with PuACO1, which converts 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) to ethylene, and suppressed its activity. BR-activated PuBZR1 bound to the promoters of PuACO1 and of PuACS1a, which encodes ACC synthase, and directly suppressed their transcription. Moreover, PuBZR1 suppressed the expression of transcription factor PuERF2 by binding its promoter, and PuERF2 bound to the promoters of PuACO1 and PuACS1a. We concluded that PuBZR1 indirectly suppresses the transcription of PuACO1 and PuACS1a through its regulation of PuERF2. Ethylene production and expression profiles of corresponding apple (Malus domestica) homologs showed similar changes following epibrassinolide treatment. Together, these results suggest that BR-activated BZR1 suppresses ACO1 activity and the expression of ACO1 and ACS1, thereby reducing ethylene production and suppressing fruit ripening. This likely represents a conserved mechanism by which BR suppresses ethylene biosynthesis during climacteric fruit ripening.
