['26120968', 'Optimal timing of flowering in higher plants is crucial for successful  reproduction and is coordinated by external and internal factors, including light  and the circadian clock. In Arabidopsis, light-dependent stabilization of the  rhythmically expressed CONSTANS (CO) is required for the activation of FLOWERING  LOCUS T (FT), resulting in the initiation of flowering. Phytochrome A and  cryptochrome photoreceptors stabilize CO in the evening by attenuating the  activity of the CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1-SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 1  (COP1-SPA1) ubiquitin ligase complex, which promotes turnover of CO. In contrast,  phytochrome B (phyB) facilitates degradation of CO in the morning and delays  flowering. Accordingly, flowering is accelerated in phyB mutants. Paradoxically,  plants overexpressing phyB also show early flowering, which may arise from an  early phase of rhythmic CO expression. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of  phyB induces FT transcription at dusk and in the night without affecting the  phase or level of CO transcription. This response depends on the light-activated  Pfr form of phyB that inhibits the function of the COP1-SPA1 complex by direct  interactions. Our data suggest that attenuation of COP1 activity results in the  accumulation of CO protein and subsequent induction of FT. We show that  phosphorylation of Ser-86 inhibits this function of phyB by accelerating dark  reversion and thus depletion of Pfr forms in the night. Our results explain the  early flowering phenotype of phyB overexpression and reveal additional features  of the molecular machinery by which photoreceptors mediate photoperiodism.', '2015 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12926', 'Nagy']
