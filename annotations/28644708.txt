Symmetric division of leaf mesophyll chloroplasts requires MinD and MinE, which work together to suppress division other than at the mid-chloroplast. arc11 is a MinD loss-of-function mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana. In arc11 plants, asymmetric chloroplast division, as well as its delay or arrest, results in extreme size polymorphism of chloroplasts in mature mesophyll cells. The current study examined chloroplast phenotypes in the epidermis of arc11 leaves. Fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that epidermal chloroplasts in mature leaves exhibited moderate heterogeneity in size. This probably resulted from completion of many of the previous non-equatorial or multiple division events in expanding leaves. Additionally, analyses of plastids found that epidermal chloroplasts in arc11 mutants showed several phenotypes that have not previously been described.

MinD: !works with! MinE
arc11: !results in! extreme size polymorphism of chloroplasts
