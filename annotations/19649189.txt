Studies of floral scent generally assume that genetic adaptation due to pollinator-mediated natural selection explains a significant amount of phenotypic variance, ignoring the potential for phenotypic plasticity in this trait. In this paper, we assess this latter possibility, looking first at previous studies of floral scent variation in relation to abiotic environmental factors. We then present data from our own research that suggests among-population floral scent variation is determined, in part, by environmental conditions and thus displays phenotypic plasticity. Such an outcome has strong ramifications for the study of floral scent variation; we conclude by presenting some fundamental questions that should lead to greater insight into our understanding of the evolution of this trait, which is important to plant-animal interactions.
