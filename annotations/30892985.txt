Heterospory (i.e. dimorphic spores) is a long-lasting topic discussed in plant biology. It is observed in many of ferns, fern allies, and seed plants. The rise of heterospory and the mechanisms underlying its success in plant evolution are not clearly elucidated. In this short communication, an attempt is made to shed some light on these two questions.
