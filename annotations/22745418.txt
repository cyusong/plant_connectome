Most mineral elements found in plant tissues come exclusively from the soil, necessitating that plants adapt to highly variable soil compositions to survive and thrive. Profiling element concentrations in genetically diverse plant populations is providing insights into the plant-environment interactions that control elemental accumulation, as well as identifying the underlying genes. The resulting molecular understanding of plant adaptation to the environment both demonstrates how soils can shape genetic diversity and provides solutions to important agricultural challenges.
