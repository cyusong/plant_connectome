Fully mycoheterotrophic plants can be difficult to place in plant phylogeny due to elevated substitution rates associated with photosynthesis loss. This potentially limits the effectiveness of downstream analyses of mycoheterotrophy that depend on accurate phylogenetic inference. Although mitochondrial genomic data sets are rarely used in plant phylogenetics, theory predicts that they should be resilient to long-branch artefacts, thanks to their generally slow evolution, coupled with limited rate elevation in heterotrophs. We examined the utility of mitochondrial genomes for resolving contentious higher-order placements of mycoheterotrophic lineages in two test cases: monocots (focusing on Dioscoreales) and Ericaceae. We find Thismiaceae to be distantly related to Burmanniaceae in the monocot order Dioscoreales, conflicting with current classification schemes based on few gene data sets. We confirm that the unusual Afrothismia is related to Taccaceae-Thismiaceae, with a corresponding independent loss of photosynthesis. In Ericaceae we recovered the first well supported relationships among its five major lineages: mycoheterotrophic Ericaceae are not monophyletic, as pyroloids are inferred to be sister to core Ericaceae, and monotropoids to arbutoids. Genes recovered from mitochondrial genomes collectively resolved previously ambiguous mycoheterotroph higher-order relationships. We propose that mitochondrial genomic data should be considered in standardised gene panels for inferring overall plant phylogeny.
