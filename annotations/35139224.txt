In barley, incubation of primary dormant (D1) grains on water under conditions that do not allow germination, i.e. 30°C in air and 15°C or 30°C in 5% O2, induces a secondary dormancy (D2) expressed as a loss of the ability to germinate at 15°C in air. The aim of this study was to compare the proteome of barley embryos isolated from D1 grains and D2 ones after induction of D2 at 30°C or in hypoxia at 15°C or 30°C. Total soluble proteins were analyzed by 2DE gel-based proteomics, allowing the selection of 130 differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) among 1,575 detected spots. According to the protein abundance profiles, the DAPs were grouped into six abundance-based similarity clusters. Induction of D2 is mainly characterized by a down-accumulation of proteins belonging to cluster 3 (storage proteins, proteases, alpha-amylase inhibitors and histone deacetylase HD2) and an up-accumulation of proteins belonging to cluster 4 (1-Cys peroxiredoxin, lipoxygenase2 and caleosin). The correlation-based network analysis for each cluster highlighted central protein hub. In addition, most of genes encoding DAPs display high co-expression degree with 19 transcription factors. Finally, this work points out that similar molecular events accompany the modulation of dormancy cycling by both temperature and oxygen, including post-translational, transcriptional and epigenetic regulation.
