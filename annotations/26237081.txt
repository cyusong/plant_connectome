Adaptation to stress entails a repertoire of molecular pathways that remodel the proteome, thereby promoting selective translation of pro-survival proteins. Yet, translation of other proteins, especially those which are harmful for stress adaptation is, on the contrary, transiently suppressed through mRNA decay or storage. Proteome remodeling under stress is intimately associated with the cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes called stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs). The molecular composition and regulation of SGs and PBs in plants remain largely unknown. Recently, we identified the Arabidopsis Tudor Staphylococcal Nuclease (TSN, Tudor-SN or SND1) as a SG- and PB-associated protein required for mRNA decapping under stress conditions. Here we show that SGs localize in close proximity to PBs within plant cells that enable the exchange of molecular components. Furthermore, we provide a meta-analysis of mRNA degradome of TSN-deficient plants suggesting that TSN might inhibit the degradation of mRNAs which are involved in stress adaptation. Our results establish TSN as a versatile mRNA regulator during stress.
