The root-knot nematode Meloidogyne chitwoodi is a pest that affects potato production in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Here, to develop new strategies against M. chitwoodi infection of potato, we engineered Bacillus subtilis to secrete the plant-defence elicitor peptide StPep1. Pre-treatment of potato roots with the bacteria secreting StPep1 substantially reduced root galling, indicating that a bacterial secretion of a plant elicitor is an effective strategy for plant protection.

Bacillus subtilis: !secretes! StPep1
StPep1: !protects! potato roots
Meloidogyne chitwoodi: !affects! potato production
Bacillus subtilis: !pre-treats! potato roots
