• Pollinators, as gene flow vectors and selection agents, play a central role in the origin and maintenance of floral variation in natural populations. However, it is debatable whether pollination alone can complete the speciation process in sympatry. • Mating patterns and phenotypic selection on floral traits were characterized over two flowering seasons for sympatric corolla tube length morphs of the hawkmoth-pollinated iris Gladiolus longicollis. A mating model with genetic and spatial-temporal predictors was developed to identify seed paternity. A multivariate analysis was used to estimate selection on correlated floral traits based on maternal and paternal fitness. • Mating patterns among floral morphs were density dependent, resulting in assortative mating at low plant densities, and random mating among morphs at high densities. Weak disruptive selection on tube length was detected in one season for maternal fitness. Plant height was under opposing directional selection for maternal (+) and paternal (-) fitness functions. • These results indicate that G. longicollis morphs will introgress rather than diverge towards speciation. The lack of strong assortative mating, particularly at high densities, is predicted to result in the loss of rare morphs within populations, and indicates that spatial and temporal co-occurrences of floral morphs are evolutionarily unstable.
