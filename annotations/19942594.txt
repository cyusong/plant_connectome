The identification of Fe transport forms in plant xylem sap is crucial to the understanding of long-distance Fe transport processes in plants. Previous studies have proposed that Fe may be transported as an Fe-citrate complex in plant xylem sap, but such a complex has never been detected. In this study we report the first direct and unequivocal identification of a natural Fe complex in plant xylem sap. A tri-Fe(III), tri-citrate complex (Fe(3)Cit(3)) was found in the xylem sap of Fe-deficient tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Mill. cv. 'Tres Cantos') resupplied with Fe, by using an integrated mass spectrometry approach based on exact molecular mass, isotopic signature and Fe determination and retention time. This complex has been modeled as having an oxo-bridged tri-Fe core. A second complex, a di-Fe(III), di-citrate complex was also detected in Fe-citrate standards along with Fe(3)Cit(3), with the allocation of Fe between the two complexes depending on the Fe to citrate ratio. These results provide evidence for Fe-citrate complex xylem transport in plants. The consequences for the role of Fe to citrate ratio in long-distance transport of Fe in xylem are also discussed.
