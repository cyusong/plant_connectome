The circadian clock relies on regulated degradation of clock proteins to maintain rhythmicity. Despite this, we know few components that mediate protein degradation. This is due to high levels of functional redundancy within plant E3 ubiquitin ligase families. In order to overcome this issue and discover E3 ubiquitin ligases that control circadian function, we generated a library of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing dominant-negative 'decoy' E3 ubiquitin ligases. We determined their effects on the circadian clock and identified dozens of new potential regulators of circadian function. To demonstrate the potency of the decoy screening methodology to overcome redundancy and identify <i>bona fide</i> clock regulators, we performed follow-up studies on <i>MAC3A</i> (<i>PUB59</i>) and <i>MAC3B</i> (<i>PUB60</i>). We show that they redundantly control circadian period by regulating splicing. This work demonstrates the viability of ubiquitin ligase decoys as a screening platform to overcome genetic challenges and discover E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate plant development.
