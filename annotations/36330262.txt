<i>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</i>-mediated (ARM) transformation is an efficient and powerful tool to generate transgenic roots to study root-related biology. For loss-of-function studies, transgenic-root-induced indel mutations by CRISPR/Cas9 only with homozygous/biallelic mutagenesis can exhibit mutant phenotype(s) (excluding recessive traits). However, a low frequency of homozygous mutants was produced by a constitutive promoter to drive <i>Cas9</i> expression. Here, we identified a highly efficient <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> gamma-<i>glutamylcysteine synthetase</i> promoter, termed <i>AtGCSpro</i>, with strong activity in the region where the root meristem will initiate and in the whole roots in broad eudicots species. <i>AtGCSpro</i> achieved higher homozygous/biallelic mutation efficiency than the most widely used <i>CaMV 35S</i> promoter in driving <i>Cas9</i> expression in soybean, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and tomato roots. Using the p<i>AtGCSpro</i>-Cas9 system, the average homozygous/biallelic mutation frequency is 1.7-fold and 8.3-fold higher than the p<i>2 × 35Spro</i>-Cas9 system for single and two target site(s) in the genome, respectively. Our results demonstrate the advantage of the p<i>AtGCSpro</i>-Cas9 system used in ARM transformation, especially its great potential in diploids with multiple-copy genes targeted mutations and polyploid plants with multiplex genome editing. <i>AtGCSpro</i> is conservatively active in various eudicots species, suggesting that <i>AtGCSpro</i> might be applied in a wide range of dicots species.
