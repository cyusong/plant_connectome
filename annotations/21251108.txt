['21251108', 'There are 10 genes in the Arabidopsis genome that contain a domain described in  the Pfam database as domain of unknown function 579 (DUF579). Although DUF579 is  widely distributed in eukaryotic species, there is no direct experimental  evidence to assign a function to it. Five of the 10 Arabidopsis DUF579 family  members are co-expressed with marker genes for secondary cell wall formation.  Plants in which two closely related members of the DUF579 family have been  disrupted by T-DNA insertions contain less xylose in the secondary cell wall as a  result of decreased xylan content, and exhibit mildly distorted xylem vessels.  Consequently we have named these genes IRREGULAR XYLEM 15 (IRX15) and IRX15L.  These mutant plants exhibit many features of previously described xylan synthesis  mutants, such as the replacement of glucuronic acid side chains with  methylglucuronic acid side chains. By contrast, immunostaining of xylan and  transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that the walls of these  irx15 irx15l double mutants are disorganized, compared with the wild type or  other previously described xylan mutants, and exhibit dramatic increases in the  quantity of sugar released in cell wall digestibility assays. Furthermore,  localization studies using fluorescent fusion proteins label both the Golgi and  also an unknown intracellular compartment. These data are consistent with irx15  and irx15l defining a new class of genes involved in xylan biosynthesis. How  these genes function during xylan biosynthesis and deposition is discussed.', '2011 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04501.x', 'Turner']
