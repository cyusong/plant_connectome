Lignified stone cell content is a key factor used to evaluate fruit quality, influencing the economic value of pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) fruits. However, our understanding of the regulatory networks of stone cell formation is limited due to the complex secondary metabolic pathway. In this study, we used a combination of co-expression network analysis, gene expression profiles, and transcriptome analysis in different pear cultivars with varied stone cell content to identify a hub MYB gene, PbrMYB24. The relative expression of PbrMYB24 in fruit flesh was significantly correlated with the contents of stone cells, lignin, and cellulose. We then verified the function of PbrMYB24 in regulating lignin and cellulose formation via genetic transformation in homologous and heterologous systems. We constructed a high-efficiency verification system for lignin and cellulose biosynthesis genes in pear callus. PbrMYB24 transcriptionally activated multiple target genes involved in stone cell formation. On the one hand, PbrMYB24 activated the transcription of lignin and cellulose biosynthesis genes by binding to different cis-elements (AC elements and MYB-binding sites). On the other hand, PbrMYB24 bound directly to the promoters of PbrMYB169 and NAC STONE CELL PROMOTING FACTOR (PbrNSC), activating the gene expression. Moreover, both PbrMYB169 and PbrNSC activated the promoter of PbrMYB24, enhancing gene expression. This study improves our understanding of lignin and cellulose synthesis regulation in pear fruits through identifying a regulator and establishing a regulatory network. This knowledge will be useful for reducing the stone cell content in pears via molecular breeding.
