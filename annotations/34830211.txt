Fruit firmness is an important economical trait in sweet cherry (<i>Prunus avium</i> L.) where the change of this trait is related to cell wall degradation. Xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) and polygalacturonases (PGs) are critical cell-wall-modifying enzymes that occupy a crucial position in fruit ripening and softening. Herein, we identified 18 <i>XTHs</i> and 45 <i>PGs</i> designated <i>PavXTH1-18</i> and <i>PavPG1-45</i> based on their locations in the genome of sweet cherry. We provided a systematical overview of <i>PavXTHs</i> and <i>PavPGs</i>, including phylogenetic relationships, conserved motifs, and expression profiling of these genes. The results showed that <i>PavXTH14</i>, <i>PavXTH15</i> and <i>PavPG38</i> were most likely to participated in fruit softening owing to the substantial increment in expression during fruit development and ripening. Furthermore, the phytohormone ABA, MeJA, and ethephon significantly elevated the expression of <i>PavPG38</i> and <i>PavXTH15</i>, and thus promoted fruit softening. Importantly, transient expression <i>PavXTH14</i>, <i>PavXTH15</i> and <i>PavPG38</i> in cherry fruits significantly reduced the fruit firmness, and the content of various cell wall components including hemicellulose and pectin significantly changed correspondingly in the transgenic fruit. Taken together, these results present an extensive analysis of <i>XTHs</i> and <i>PGs</i> in sweet cherry and provide potential targets for breeding softening-resistant sweet cherry cultivars via manipulating cell wall-associated genes.
