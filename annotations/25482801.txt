In a determinate meristem, such as a floral meristem, a genetically determined number of organs are produced before the meristem is terminated. In rice, iterative formation of organs during flower development with defects in meristem determinacy, classically called 'proliferation', is caused by several mutations and observed in dependence on environmental conditions. Here we report that overexpression of several JAZ proteins, key factors in jasmonate signaling, with mutations in the Jas domains causes an increase in the numbers of organs in florets, aberrant patterns of organ formation and repetitious organ production in spikelets. Our results imply that JAZ factors modulate mechanisms that regulate meristem functions during spikelet development.
