Plants are aerobic organisms relying on oxygen to serve their energy needs. The amount of oxygen available to sustain plant growth can vary significantly due to environmental constraints or developmental programs. In particular, flooding stress, which negatively impacts crop productivity, is characterized by a decline in oxygen availability. Oxygen fluctuations result in an altered redox balance and the formation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) during the onset of hypoxia and upon re-oxygenation. In this update, we provide an overview of the current understanding of the impact of redox and ROS/RNS on low-oxygen signaling and adaptation. We first focus on the formation of ROS and RNS during low-oxygen conditions. Following this, we examine the impact of hypoxia on cellular and organellar redox systems. Finally, we describe how redox and ROS/RNS participate in signaling events during hypoxia through potential post-translational modifications (PTMs) of hypoxia-relevant proteins. The aim of this update is to define our current understanding of the field and to provide avenues for future research directions.
