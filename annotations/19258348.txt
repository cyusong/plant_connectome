['19258348', 'Unlike the well-known functions of cold shock proteins in prokaryotes during cold  adaptation, the biological functions of cold shock domain proteins (CSDPs) in  plants remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the functional roles of two  structurally different CSDPs, CSDP1 harboring a long C-terminal glycine-rich  region interspersed with seven CCHC-type zinc fingers and CSDP2 containing a far  shorter glycine-rich region interspersed with two CCHC-type zinc fingers, in  Arabidopsis thaliana under stress conditions. CSDP1 overexpression delayed the  seed germination of Arabidopsis under dehydration or salt stress conditions,  whereas CSDP2 overexpression accelerated the seed germination of Arabidopsis  under salt stress conditions. CSDP1 and CSDP2 rescued the cold-sensitive  glycine-rich RNA-binding protein 7 mutant plants from freezing damage to a  different degree, and this rescuing capability was correlated with their ability  to complement the cold-sensitive Escherichia coli BX04 mutant at low  temperatures. The nucleic acid-binding properties of CSDPs varied depending on  the N-terminal cold shock domain and the C-terminal glycine-rich zinc finger  region. Collectively, these results showed that CSDP1 and CSDP2 perform different  functions in seed germination and growth of Arabidopsis under stress conditions,  and that the glycine-rich region interspersed with CCHC-type zinc fingers is  particularly important for its nucleic acid-binding activities and function.', '2009 Apr', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcp037', 'Kang']
