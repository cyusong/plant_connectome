Precise identification of crop insects is a crucial aspect of intelligent plant protection. Recently, with the development of deep learning methods, the efficiency of insect recognition has been significantly improved. However, the recognition rate of existing models for small insect targets is still insufficient for insect early warning or precise variable pesticide application. Small insects occupy less pixel information on the image, making it more difficult for the model to extract feature information. To improve the identification accuracy of small insect targets, in this paper, we proposed S-ResNet, a model improved from the ResNet, by varying its convolution kernel. The branch of the residual structure was added and the Feature Multiplexing Module (FMM) was illustrated. Therefore, the feature expression capacity of the model was improved using feature information of different scales. Meanwhile, the Adjacent Elimination Module (AEM) was furtherly employed to eliminate the useless information in the extracted features of the model. The training and validation results showed that the improved residual structure improved the feature extraction ability of small insect targets compared to the original model. With compare of 18, 30, or 50 layers, the S-ResNet enhanced the identification accuracy of small insect targets by 7% than that on the ResNet model with same layer depth.
