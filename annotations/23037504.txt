Current background ozone (O(3)) concentrations over the northern hemisphere's midlatitudes are high enough to damage crops and are projected to increase. Soybean (Glycine max) is particularly sensitive to O(3); therefore, establishing an O(3) exposure threshold for damage is critical to understanding the current and future impact of this pollutant. This study aims to determine the exposure response of soybean to elevated tropospheric O(3) by measuring the agronomic, biochemical, and physiological responses of seven soybean genotypes to nine O(3) concentrations (38-120 nL L(-1)) within a fully open-air agricultural field location across 2 years. All genotypes responded similarly, with season-long exposure to O(3) causing a linear increase in antioxidant capacity while reducing leaf area, light absorption, specific leaf mass, primary metabolites, seed yield, and harvest index. Across two seasons with different temperature and rainfall patterns, there was a robust linear yield decrease of 37 to 39 kg ha(-1) per nL L(-1) cumulative O(3) exposure over 40 nL L(-1). The existence of immediate effects of O(3) on photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic transcript abundance before and after the initiation and termination of O(3) fumigation were concurrently assessed, and there was no evidence to support an instantaneous photosynthetic response. The ability of the soybean canopy to intercept radiation, the efficiency of photosynthesis, and the harvest index were all negatively impacted by O(3), suggesting that there are multiple targets for improving soybean responses to this damaging air pollutant.
