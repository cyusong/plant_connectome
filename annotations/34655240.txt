The molecular mechanisms of quantitative resistance (QR) to fungal pathogens and their relationships with growth pathways are poorly understood. We identified tomato TRK1 (TPK1b Related Kinase1) and determined its functions in tomato QR and plant growth. TRK1 is a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase that complexes with tomato LysM Receptor Kinase (SlLYK1). SlLYK1 and TRK1 are required for chitin-induced fungal resistance, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and expression of immune response genes. Notably, TRK1 and SlLYK1 regulate SlMYC2, a major transcriptional regulator of jasmonic acid (JA) responses and fungal resistance, at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Further, TRK1 is also required for maintenance of proper meristem growth, as revealed by the ectopic meristematic activity, enhanced branching, and altered floral structures in TRK1 RNAi plants. Consistently, TRK1 interacts with SlCLV1 and SlWUS, and TRK1 RNAi plants show increased expression of SlCLV3 and SlWUS in shoot apices. Interestingly, TRK1 suppresses chitin-induced gene expression in meristems but promotes expression of the same genes in leaves. SlCLV1 and TRK1 perform contrasting functions in defense but similar functions in plant growth. Overall, through molecular and biochemical interactions with critical regulators, TRK1 links upstream defense and growth signals to downstream factor in fungal resistance and growth homeostasis response regulators.
