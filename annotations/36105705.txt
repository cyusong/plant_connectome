The seed is an evolutionary innovation in the plant kingdom. While human civilization depends heavily on seed production, how the seed trait emerged remains elusive. In this opinion article, a "golden-trio hypothesis" is proposed based on our investigations of <i>LEC1</i> gene functions in <i>Adiantum capillus-veneris</i>. This hypothesis posits that a "seed program" arose from spatiotemporal integration of three key components: assimilate flow, ABA-mediated stress responses, and stress-induced <i>LEC1</i> expression. Thus, the evolutionary innovation of seeds should be considered not a simple event resulting from new genes; rather, it represents the outcome of a series of physiological and morphological innovations that emerged prior to and regardless of the origin of the seed program. This new perspective could help us tackle some long-standing questions around the puzzling origin of seeds.
