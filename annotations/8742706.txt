['8742706', 'Ovules play a central role in plant reproduction, generating the female  gametophyte within sporophytic integuments. When fertilized, the integuments  differentiate into the seed coat and support the development of the embryo and  endosperm. Mutations in the AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) locus of Arabidopsis have a  profound effect on ovule development. Strong ant mutants have ovules that fail to  form integuments or a female gametophyte. Flower development is also altered,  with a random reduction of organs in the outer three whorls. In addition, organs  present in the outer three floral whorls often have abnormal morphology. Ovules  from a weak ant mutant contain both inner and outer integuments but generally  fail to produce a functional female gametophyte. We isolated the ANT gene by  using a mutation derived by T-DNA insertional mutagenesis. ANT is a member of a  gene family that includes the floral homeotic gene APETALA2 (AP2). Like AP2, ANT  contains two AP2 domains homologous with the DNA binding domain of ethylene  response element binding proteins. ANT is expressed most highly in developing  flowers but is also expressed in vegetative tissue. Taken together, these results  suggest that ANT is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in  regulating ovule and female gametophyte development.', '1996 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.8.2.137', 'Fischer']
