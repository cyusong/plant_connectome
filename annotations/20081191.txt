['20081191', 'Plant cell signaling triggers the abscission of entire organs, such as fruit,  leaves and flowers. Previously, we characterized an ADP-ribosylation factor  GTPase-activating protein, NEVERSHED (NEV), that regulates membrane trafficking  and is essential for floral organ shedding in Arabidopsis. Through a screen for  mutations that restore organ separation in nev flowers, we have identified a  leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, EVERSHED (EVR), that functions as an  inhibitor of abscission. Defects in the Golgi structure and location of the  trans-Golgi network in nev abscission zone cells are rescued by a mutation in  EVR, suggesting that EVR might regulate membrane trafficking during abscission.  In addition to shedding their floral organs prematurely, nev evr flowers show  enlarged abscission zones. A similar phenotype was reported for plants  ectopically expressing INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION, a predicted  signaling ligand for the HAESA/HAESA-LIKE2 receptor-like kinases, indicating that  this signaling pathway may be constitutively active in nev evr flowers. We  present a model in which EVR modulates the timing and region of abscission by  promoting the internalization of other receptor-like kinases from the plasma  membrane.', '2010 Feb', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.041335', 'Liljegren']
