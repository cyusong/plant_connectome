['24465213', 'RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is required for transcriptional silencing of  transposons and other DNA repeats in Arabidopsis thaliana. Although previous  research has demonstrated that the SET domain-containing SU(VAR)3-9 homologs  SUVH2 and SUVH9 are involved in the RdDM pathway, the underlying mechanism  remains unknown. Our results indicated that SUVH2 and/or SUVH9 not only interact  with the chromatin-remodeling complex termed DDR (DMS3, DRD1, and RDM1) but also  with the newly characterized complex composed of two conserved Microrchidia  (MORC) family proteins, MORC1 and MORC6. The effect of suvh2suvh9 on Pol  IV-dependent siRNA accumulation and DNA methylation is comparable to that of the  Pol V mutant nrpe1 and the DDR complex mutant dms3, suggesting that SUVH2 and  SUVH9 are functionally associated with RdDM. Our CHIP assay demonstrated that  SUVH2 and SUVH9 are required for the occupancy of Pol V at RdDM loci and  facilitate the production of Pol V-dependent noncoding RNAs. Moreover, SUVH2 and  SUVH9 are also involved in the occupancy of DMS3 at RdDM loci. The putative  catalytic active site in the SET domain of SUVH2 is dispensable for the function  of SUVH2 in RdDM and H3K9 dimethylation. We propose that SUVH2 and SUVH9 bind to  methylated DNA and facilitate the recruitment of Pol V to RdDM loci by  associating with the DDR complex and the MORC complex.', '2014 Jan', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1003948', 'He']
