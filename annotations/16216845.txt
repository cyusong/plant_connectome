Previous studies of grapes and tomatoes have shown that the abundance of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) increases in their flesh at the start of ripening, and that this coincides with a decrease in its citrate and/or malate content. Thus, PEPCK might function in the catabolism of organic acid anions during the ripening of these fruits. In the present study, the abundance of PEPCK was determined in the flesh of blueberries, raspberries, red currants, and strawberries at different stages of their development. In addition, changes in the amounts of citrate, malate, soluble sugars, isocitrate lyase, NADP-malic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, and pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase in the flesh were determined. PEPCK was not detected in strawberry flesh, in which there was no dissimilation of malate or citrate. In the flesh of the other fruits, the abundance of PEPCK increased during ripening to an amount that was similar to that in grapes and tomatoes. In the flesh of blueberries and red currants, PEPCK was most abundant when there was dissimilation of malate. In the flesh of raspberries, PEPCK was most abundant when there was dissimilation of malate and citrate. These results are consistent with PEPCK playing a role in the dissimilation of citrate and/or malate in the flesh of these fruits during ripening. However, PEPCK was also present in the flesh of blueberries, raspberries, and red currants when there was no dissimilation of malate or citrate, and this raises the possibility that PEPCK might have additional functions. Dissection of blueberries provided evidence that both PEPCK and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase were present in the same cells, and possible functions for this are discussed.
