RNA acetylation on N<sup>4</sup>-cytidine (ac<sup>4</sup>C) has recently been discovered as a novel modification on mRNA. The RNA ac<sup>4</sup>C modification was shown to be a key regulator of RNA stability, RNA translation, and the thermal stress response. However, its existence on eukaryotic mRNA is still controversial. In plants, the existence, distribution pattern and potential function of RNA ac<sup>4</sup>C modification are largely unknown. Here we report the presence of ac<sup>4</sup>C on the mRNA of both Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa). By comparing two ac<sup>4</sup>C sequencing methods, we found that acRIP-seq but not ac<sup>4</sup>C-seq was suitable for plant RNA ac<sup>4</sup>C modification sequencing. We present transcriptome-wide atlases of RNA ac<sup>4</sup>C modification in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice mRNAs obtained by acRIP-seq. Analysis of RNA ac<sup>4</sup>C modification distribution showed that ac<sup>4</sup>C was enriched near translation start sites in rice mRNAs and near translation start sites and translation end sites in Arabidopsis mRNAs. The RNA ac<sup>4</sup>C modification level was positively correlated with RNA half-lives and the number of splicing variants. Similar to that in mammals, the translation efficiency of ac<sup>4</sup>C target genes was significantly higher than other genes. Our in vitro translation results also confirmed that RNA ac<sup>4</sup>C modification enhanced translation efficiency. We also found that RNA ac<sup>4</sup>C modification was negatively correlated with RNA structure. Our results suggest that ac<sup>4</sup>C is a conserved mRNA modification in plants that contributes to RNA stability, splicing, translation, and secondary structure formation.
