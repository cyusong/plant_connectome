The integrated transcriptome data analyses suggested the plausible roles of lncRNAs during seed development in chickpea. The candidate lncRNAs associated with QTLs and those involved in miRNA-mediated seed size/weight determination in chickpea have been identified. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of various biological processes. Here, we identified lncRNAs at seven successive stages of seed development in small-seeded and large-seeded chickpea cultivars. In total, 4751 lncRNAs implicated in diverse biological processes were identified. Most of lncRNAs were conserved between the two cultivars, whereas only a few of them were conserved in other plants, suggesting their species-specificity. A large number of lncRNAs differentially expressed between the two chickpea cultivars associated with seed development-related processes were identified. The lncRNAs acting as precursors of miRNAs and those mimicking target protein-coding genes of miRNAs involved in seed size/weight determination, including HAIKU1, BIG SEEDS1, and SHB1, were also revealed. Further, lncRNAs located within seed size/weight associated quantitative trait loci were also detected. Overall, we present a comprehensive resource and identified candidate lncRNAs that may play important roles during seed development and seed size/weight determination in chickpea.
