['26306426', 'Zinc (Zn) depletion adversely affects plant growth. To avoid lethal depletion of  cellular Zn, plants have evolved mechanisms to adjust the expression of genes  associated with Zn homeostasis, the details of which are poorly understood. In  the present study, we isolated an Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA insertion mutant  that exhibited hypersensitivity to Zn depletion. By monitoring root development  under Zn-deficient conditions, we isolated a single mutant lacking the  basic-region leucine-zipper transcription factor gene bZIP19. To identify  proteins whose expression is affected by bZIP19, an iTRAQ-based quantitative  proteomics analysis was performed using microsomal proteins from wild-type and  the bzip19 mutant A. thaliana roots grown on Basal and Zn-deficient media. Of the  797 proteins identified, expression of two members of the Zrt- and Irt-related  protein family, ZIP3 and ZIP9, and three defensin-like family proteins was  markedly induced in wild-type but not in the bzip19 mutant under Zn-deficient  conditions. Furthermore, selected reaction monitoring and quantitative real-time  PCR revealed that ZIP9 expression is mediated by bZIP19 and may be partly  supported by bZIP23, a homolog of bZIP19. Mutant analysis revealed that ZIP9 is  involved in uptake of Zn by the roots, and the mutant lacking ZIP9 was  significantly more sensitive to Zn depletion than the wild-type. These results  demonstrate that bZIP19 mainly contributes to expression of genes, such as ZIP9,  under Zn-deficient conditions.', '2015 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12996', 'Fukao']
