Arabidopsis Mediator subunits 2, 14, 15a, 16, and 25 are required for papillae development on the trichome cell wall surface. Arabidopsis leaf hairs exhibit raised protrusions, termed papillae, on their cell wall surfaces. Here, we show that the glassy hair mutant, glh2, exhibits trichomes with an approximate 11-fold decrease in papillae density on their surfaces in comparison to wild type. This phenotype was found to be the result of mutations in Arabidopsis Mediator subunit 16. MED16 is localized to the nucleus of trichomes, consistent with Mediator's role in transcription. The expression patterns of the trichome development reporters, ETR2pro::GUS and GL2pro::GUS, as well as GL2 transcript levels were not altered in the glh2 mutant. Screening of available T-DNA insertion lines in other subunits of the Mediator tail module revealed glassy trichome phenotypes in med2, med14, and med15a mutants. The data suggest that the Mediator complex is required for expression of genes involved in trichome papillae development.
