The potential role of the resin system in the response of Austrian pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) seedlings to mechanical injury and fungal infection was studied in greenhouse experiments. Anatomical observations were performed on 2-year-old plants wounded at collar level and inoculated with Sphaeropsis sapinea (Fr.: Fr.) Dyko & Sutton in Sutton or Diplodia scrobiculata (J. de Wet, B. Slippers & M. J. Wingfield, sp. nov.; sensu de Wet et al. 2003), two fungal pathogens that cause shoot blight and canker on conifers, and that are characterized by different levels of aggressiveness. Histological examination of host tissue taken from the stem at 0, 8, and 12 cm above the treatment site revealed significant treatment- and time-dependent effects on the course of locally and systemically induced traumatic resin duct (TRD) development. Occurrence of TRDs was observed after 4 days only in seedlings inoculated with D. scrobiculata. At 12 days, TRDs were present also in mock-inoculated controls. No TRDs appeared in seedlings inoculated with S. sapinea. However, S. sapinea caused loss of vacuolar phenolics, severe disruption of cambial tissue and invaded the host xylem quickly and apparently unimpeded, whereas D. scrobiculata was never detected in the host xylem. Five-year-old Austrian pines subjected to the same stem base treatments were used to determine the resin mass flowing from the stem 30 cm above the treatment sites. Wounding and/or inoculation induced a significant, 8.3-fold average increase in systemic resin flow over the untreated trees 3 weeks after basal treatment, suggesting that wounding is the sole prerequisite for systemic induction of resin flow. The results are discussed in the context of current disease resistance models.
