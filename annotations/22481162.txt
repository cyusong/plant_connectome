['22481162', 'In higher plants, the metabolism of carbon (C) and nitrogen nutrients (N) is  mutually regulated and referred to as the C and N balance (C/N). Plants are thus  able to optimize their growth depending on their cellular C/N status. Arabidopsis  ATL31 and ATL6 encode a RING-type ubiquitin ligases which play a critical role in  the C/N status response (Sato et al. in Plant J 60:852-864, 2009). Since many ATL  members are involved in the plant defense response, the present study evaluated  whether the C/N response regulators ATL31 and ATL6 are involved in defense  responses. Our results confirmed that ATL31 and ATL6 expression is up-regulated  with the microbe-associated molecular patterns elicitors flg22 and chitin as well  as with infections with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst. DC3000).  Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing ATL31 and ATL6 displayed increased  resistance to Pst. DC3000. In accordance with these data, loss of ATL31 and ATL6  function in an atl31 atl6 double knockout mutant resulted in reduced resistance  to Pst. DC3000. In addition, the molecular cross-talk between C/N and the defense  response was investigated by mining public databases. The analysis identified the  transcription factors MYB51 and WRKY33, which are involved in the defense  response, and their transcripts levels correlate closely with ATL31 and ATL6.  Further study demonstrated that the expression of ATL31, ATL6 and defense marker  genes including MYB51 and WRKY33 were regulated by C/N conditions. Taken  together, these results indicate that ATL31 and ATL6 function as key components  of both C/N regulation and the defense response in Arabidopsis.', '2012 Jun', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-012-9907-0', 'Yamaguchi']
