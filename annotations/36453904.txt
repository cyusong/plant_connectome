Metabolism of metals in microalgae and adaptation to metal excess are of significant environmental importance. We report a three-step mechanism that the green microalga Chlorella sorokiniana activates during the acquisition of and adaptation to manganese (Mn), which is both an essential trace metal and a pollutant of waters. In the early stage, Mn2+ was mainly bound to membrane phospholipids and phosphates in released mucilage. The outer cell wall was reorganized and lipids were accumulated, with a relative increase in lipid saturation. Intracellular redox settings were rapidly altered in the presence of Mn excess, with increased production of reactive oxygen species that resulted in lipid peroxidation and a decrease in the concentration of thiols. In the later stage, Mn2+ was chelated by polyphosphates and accumulated in the cells. The structure of the inner cell wall was modified and the redox milieu established a new balance. Polyphosphates serve as a transient Mn2+ storage ligand, as proposed previously. In the final stage, Mn was stored in multivalent Mn clusters that resemble the structure of the tetramanganese-calcium core of the oxygen-evolving complex. The present findings elucidate the bioinorganic chemistry and metabolism of Mn in microalgae, and may shed new light on water-splitting Mn clusters.
