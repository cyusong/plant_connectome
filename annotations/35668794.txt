The wheat multi-pest resistance genes <i>Lr67</i> and <i>Lr34</i> are similar in that they both condition resistance to many diseases, in a non-race-specific manner, and code for cellular transporters. <i>Lr34</i> plays a critical role in breeding wheat for disease resistance in large part because it interacts with other resistance genes to result in effective and durable resistance. To determine if <i>Lr67</i> interacts with other resistance genes in a similar manner as <i>Lr34</i> six different doubled haploid populations were developed which segregated for either <i>Lr67</i> or <i>Lr34</i> along with a second resistance gene, either <i>Lr13</i>, <i>Lr16</i>, or <i>Lr32</i>. The presence or absence of each of these genes in the progeny lines was determined by molecular marker analysis. These six populations were tested for leaf rust field resistance in the same environments to compare the effects of <i>Lr34</i> and <i>Lr67</i> alone, and in combination with <i>Lr13</i>, <i>Lr16</i> or <i>Lr32</i>. <i>Lr67</i> and <i>Lr34</i> significantly reduced the levels of rust severity, <i>Lr34</i> showed a significant interaction with <i>Lr13</i> but <i>Lr67</i> did not. Both genes interacted with <i>Lr16</i>, and <i>Lr67</i> had a significant interaction with <i>Lr32</i>. This analysis demonstrates the similar effect of <i>Lr67</i>, as seen with <i>Lr34</i>, on the interaction with other resistance genes to give a better level of resistance than with single resistance genes. While <i>Lr67</i> is not widely deployed in agriculture, it could play an important role in disease resistance in future wheat cultivars.
