Bud dormancy allows deciduous perennial plants to rapidly grow following seasonal cold conditions. Although many studies have examined the hormonal regulation of bud growth, the role of nutrients remains unclear. Insufficient accumulation of the key micronutrient zinc (Zn) in dormant buds affects the vegetative and reproductive growth of perennial plants during the subsequent year, requiring the application of Zn fertilizers in orchard management to avoid growth defects in fruit trees. However, the mechanisms of seasonal Zn homeostasis in perennial plants remain poorly understood. Here, we provide new insights into Zn distribution and speciation within reproductive and vegetative buds of apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) and four other deciduous fruit trees (peach [<i>Amygdalus persica</i>], grape [<i>Vitis vinifera</i>], pistachio [<i>Pistacia vera</i>], and blueberry [<i>Vaccinium</i> spp.]) using microscopic and spectroscopic characterization techniques comprising synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence and x-ray absorption near-edge-structure analyses. By establishing a link between bud development and Zn distribution, we identified the following important steps of Zn storage and use in deciduous plants: Zn is preferentially deposited in the stem nodes subtending apical and axillary buds; Zn may then be sequestered as Zn-phytate prior to dormancy; in spring, Zn effectively releases for use during budbreak and subsequent meristematic growth. The mechanisms of Zn homeostasis during the seasonal cycles of plant growth and dormancy described here will contribute to improving orchard management, and to selection and breeding of deciduous perennial species.
