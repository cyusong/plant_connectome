The MYB gene family plays a vital regulatory role in plant metabolism, stress response, and floral color. The R2R3-MYB gene family of <i>C. goeringii</i> was identified, and its expression was analyzed using bioinformatics in this article. The R2R3-MYB genes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> were used as a reference to determine 104 <i>CgMYB</i> genes and categorize them into 22 subfamilies. Exon/intron organizations and conserved motif analysis revealed that the majority of <i>CgMYB</i> genes were highly conserved, and chromosome localization and collinearity analysis provided evidence of tandem duplication and segmental duplication events, indicating the phenomenon of gene family expansion and contraction. The function of <i>CgMYB</i> genes was analyzed by <i>cis</i>-acting element and gene ontology (GO) enrichment. In addition, we selected <i>CgMYB91</i> and <i>CgMYB32</i> for RT-qPCR, suggesting that <i>CgMYB91</i> and <i>CgMYB32</i> are associated with anthocyanin formation. In short, this study provides a comprehensive and specific function of the R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) in orchids.
