Soil salinity-alkalinity is one of abiotic stresses that lead to plant growth inhibition and yield loss. It has recently been indicated that plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) can enhance the capacity of plants to counteract negative effects caused by adverse environments. However, whether PGPR confers increased saline-alkaline resistance of plants and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We thus investigated the effects of Bacillus licheniformis (strain SA03) on Chrysanthemum plants grown under saline-alkaline conditions. Soil inoculation with SA03 significantly mitigated saline-alkaline stress in plants with augmented photosynthesis, biomass and survival rates. Moreover, the inoculated plants accumulated more Fe and less Na<sup>+</sup> content than the non-inoculated plants under the stress. However, the inoculation with SA03 failed to trigger a series of saline-alkaline stress responses in abscisic acid (ABA)- and nitric oxide (NO)-deficient plants. Furthermore, NO acted as a secondary messenger of ABA to regulate the stress responses and tolerance in Chrysanthemum plants. Therefore, these findings indicated that B. licheniformis SA03 could be employed to improve saline-alkaline tolerance of plants by mediating cellular ABA levels.
