Numerous factors can affect the Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOC) emitted by plants. One of these factors is the microbial communities living on leaf surfaces (phylloplane). Bacteria and fungi can use compounds produced and emitted by plants for their own metabolism. Thus, microorganism communities can modulate BVOC emissions and affect interactions between plants and other organisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of microbial communities on BVOC emissions of <i>Brassica nigra</i> leaves. Therefore, we removed bacteria and/or fungi by using bactericide/fungicide treatments in a factorial design experiment with <i>Brassica nigra</i> grown in pots. BVOC emissions were sampled before and after the treatment application. Our results showed that four new compounds (cyclohexanone, cyclohexyl cyanide and two unknown compounds) were emitted after the removal of fungi, whereas no effect was detected in response to the bactericide treatment. This suggests that fungi inhibit or reduce the production of the above mentioned BVOCs from <i>Brassica nigra</i> leaves or use those compounds for their own metabolism. The origin and the roles of the novel compounds emitted requires further investigation.
