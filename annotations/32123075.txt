Stomata in the plant epidermis play a critical role in growth and survival by controlling gas exchange, transpiration, and immunity to pathogens. Plants modulate stomatal cell fate and patterning through key transcriptional factors and signaling pathways. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to contribute to developmental plasticity in multicellular organisms; however, no miRNAs appear to target the known regulators of stomatal development. It remains unclear as to whether miRNAs are involved in stomatal development. Here, we report highly dynamic, developmentally stage-specific miRNA expression profiles from stomatal lineage cells. We demonstrate that stomatal lineage miRNAs positively and negatively regulate stomatal formation and patterning to avoid clustered stomata. Target prediction of stomatal lineage miRNAs implicates potential cellular processes in stomatal development. We show that miR399-mediated <i>PHO2</i> regulation, involved in phosphate homeostasis, contributes to the control of stomatal development. Our study demonstrates that miRNAs constitute a critical component in the regulatory mechanisms controlling stomatal development.
