Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is widely used for studying the mechanisms of embryo development. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms, especially in woody plants. Previous studies have established an SE system for Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata), but this system is genotype-dependent, which limits its application in practice. Here, we found that phytosulfokine (PSK), a plant peptide hormone, can not only increase SE efficiency, but also establish SE in recalcitrant genotypes of C. lanceolata. Proembryogenic mass (PEM) browning and determination of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) content by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein staining indicated that a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst occurred rapidly after PEMs were transferred to SE induction medium. Transcriptome analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR validation showed that PSK treatment helped to maintain ROS homeostasis by decreasing the activity of peroxidases in early SE induction. This PSK-regulated redox microenvironment might be helpful to induce expression of SE-related genes like WOX2 in early SE induction. Further analyses suggested that PSK promotes SE induction in C. lanceolata partially through decreasing H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> levels, which is necessary but not sufficient for SE induction in recalcitrant genotypes of C. lanceolata. Furthermore, heterologous overexpression of ClPSK in Arabidopsis led to enhanced SE induction and resistance to H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> stress. Taken together, our study reveals a biological function for the plant peptide hormone PSK, extends our knowledge about SE in woody trees, and provides a valuable tool for establishing an efficient and genotype-independent SE system in C. lanceolata and other coniferous trees.
