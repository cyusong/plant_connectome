Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)/NAD phosphate (NADPH) is essential for numerous redox reactions and serve as co-factors in multiple metabolic processes in all organisms. NAD kinase (NADK) is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of NADP<sup>+</sup> from NAD<sup>+</sup> and ATP. Arabidopsis NADK2 (AtNADK2) is a chloroplast-localizing enzyme that provides recipients of reducing power in photosynthetic electron transfer. When Arabidopsis plants were grown on MS medium supplemented with 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, an AtNADK2-overexpressing line exhibited higher glutathione and total sulfur accumulation than control plants. Metabolomic analysis of major amino acids and organic acids using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry demonstrated that overexpression of AtNADK2 affected a range of metabolic processes in response to MgSO<sub>4</sub> supplementation.
