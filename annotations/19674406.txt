['19674406', "We report a detailed functional characterization of an Arabidopsis  isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (AtIPMDH1) that is involved in both glucosinolate  biosynthesis and leucine biosynthesis. AtIPMDH1 shares high homology with enzymes  from bacteria and yeast that are known to function in leucine biosynthesis. In  plants, AtIPMDH1 is co-expressed with nearly all the genes known to be involved  in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis. Mutation of AtIPMDH1 leads to a  significant reduction in the levels of free leucine and of glucosinolates with  side chains of four or more carbons. Complementation of the mutant phenotype by  ectopic expression of AtIPMDH1, together with the enzyme's substrate specificity,  implicates AtIPMDH1 in both glucosinolate and leucine biosynthesis. This  functional assignment is substantiated by subcellular localization of the protein  in the chloroplast stroma, and the gene expression patterns in various tissues.  Interestingly, AtIPMDH1 activity is regulated by a thiol-based redox  modification. This work characterized an enzyme in plants that catalyzes the  oxidative decarboxylation step in both leucine biosynthesis (primary metabolism)  and methionine chain elongation of glucosinolates (specialized metabolism). It  provides evidence for the hypothesis that the two pathways share a common origin,  and suggests a role for redox regulation of glucosinolate and leucine synthesis  in plants.", '2009 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03990.x', 'Chen']
