Ricklefs and Renner (Reports, 27 January 2012, p. 464) suggested that strong correlations in the diversity of shared families between isolated tree assemblages reject neutrality. Simulations of a neutral model indicate, however, that isolated assemblages under various configurations of random speciation and extinction do sustain strong correlations in the diversity of shared families. Thus, reported correlations support rather than reject neutral theory.

Speciation: !correlates with! Extinction
Diversity: !correlates with! Shared families
Neutrality: !rejects! Correlations
Simulations: !support! Neutral theory
