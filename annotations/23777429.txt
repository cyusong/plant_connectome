Pathogenicity of the gram-negative plant-pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria depends on a membrane-spanning type III secretion (T3S) system, which translocates effector proteins into eukaryotic host cells. In this study, we characterized the T3S system component HrcV, which is a member of the YscV/FlhA family of inner membrane proteins. HrcV consists of eight transmembrane helices and a cytoplasmic region (HrcVC). Mutant and protein-protein interaction studies showed that HrcVC is essential for protein function and binds to T3S substrates, including the early substrate HrpB2, the pilus protein HrpE, and effector proteins. Furthermore, HrcVC interacts with itself and with components and control proteins of the T3S apparatus. The interaction of HrcVC with HrpB2, HrpE, and T3S system components depends on amino acid residues in a conserved motif, designated flagella/hypersensitive response/invasion proteins export pore (FHIPEP), which is located in a cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane helix four and five of HrcV. Mutations in the FHIPEP motif abolish HrcV function but do not affect the interaction of HrcVC with effector proteins.
