In petals of picotee petunia (Petunia hybrida) cultivars, margin-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of chalcone synthase A (CHSA) inhibits anthocyanin biosynthesis, resulting in marginal white tissue formation. In this study, we found that a low molecular mass compound, fluacrypyrim, inhibits PTGS of CHSA, and we explored the site-specific PTGS mechanism of operation. Fluacrypyrim treatment abolished the picotee pattern and eliminated site-specific differences in the levels of anthocyanin-related compounds, CHSA expression, and CHSA small interfering RNA (siRNA). In addition, fluacrypyrim abolished the petunia star-type pattern, which is also caused by PTGS of CHSA. Fluacrypyrim treatment was effective only at the early floral developmental stage and predominantly eliminated siRNA derived from CHS genes; i.e. siRNA derived from other genes remained at a comparable level. Fluacrypyrim probably targets the induction of PTGS that specifically operates for CHS genes in petunia picotee flowers, rather than common PTGS maintenance mechanisms that degrade mRNAs and generate siRNA. Upon treatment, the proportion of colored tissue increased due to a shift of the border between white and colored sites toward the margin in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These findings imply that the fluacrypyrim-targeted PTGS induction is completed gradually and its strength is attenuated from the margins to the center of petunia picotee petals.
