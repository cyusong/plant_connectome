In plants, the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, spermine (Spm), and thermospermine (Therm-Spm) participate in several physiological processes. In particular, Therm-Spm is involved in the control of xylem differentiation, having an auxin antagonizing effect. Polyamine oxidases (PAOs) are FAD-dependent enzymes involved in polyamine catabolism. In Arabidopsis, five PAOs are present, among which AtPAO5 catalyzes the back-conversion of Spm, Therm-Spm, and N1-acetyl-Spm to spermidine. In the present study, it is shown that two loss-of-function atpao5 mutants and a 35S::AtPAO5 Arabidopsis transgenic line present phenotypical differences from the wild-type plants with regard to stem and root elongation, differences that are accompanied by changes in polyamine levels and the number of xylem vessels. It is additionally shown that cytokinin treatment, which up-regulates AtPAO5 expression in roots, differentially affects protoxylem differentiation in 35S::AtPAO5, atpao5, and wild-type roots. Together with these findings, Therm-Spm biosynthetic genes, as well as auxin-, xylem-, and cytokinin-related genes (such as ACL5, SAMDC4, PIN1, PIN6, VND6, VND7, ATHB8, PHB, CNA, PXY, XTH3, XCP1, and AHP6) are shown to be differentially expressed in the various genotypes. These data suggest that AtPAO5, being involved in the control of Therm-Spm homeostasis, participates in the tightly controlled interplay between auxin and cytokinins that is necessary for proper xylem differentiation.
