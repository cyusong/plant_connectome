Cuticular membranes (CMs) were isolated from leaves of amphibious and submerged plants and their CO2 resistances were determined as a contribution to establish quantitatively the series of resistances met by CO2 diffusing from bulk water to the chloroplasts of submerged leaves. The isolation was performed enzymatically; permeabilities were determined and converted to resistances. The range of permeance values was 3 to 43 x 10(-6) m s(-1) corresponding to resistance values of 23 to 295 x 10(3) s m(-1), i.e. of the same order of magnitude as boundary layer resistances. The sum of boundary layer, CM, leaf cell and carboxylation resistances could be contained within the total diffusion resistance as determined from the photosynthetic CO2 affinity of the leaf. From the same species, the aerial leaf CM resistance was always higher than the aquatic leaf CM resistance. In a terrestrial plant, the CM resistance to CO2 diffusion was found lower in leaves developed submerged.
