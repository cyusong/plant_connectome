A model of electron transport from cytochrome f to photosystem I mediated by plastocyanin was designed on the basis of the multiparticle Brownian dynamics method. The model combines events which occur over a wide time range, including protein diffusion along the thylakoid membrane, long-distance interactions between proteins, formation of a multiprotein complex, electron transfer within a complex and complex dissociation. Results of the modeling were compared with the experimental kinetics measured in chloroplast thylakoids. Computer simulation demonstrated that the complex interior of the photosynthetic membrane, electrostatic interactions and Brownian diffusion provide physical conditions for the directed electron flow along the photosynthetic electron transport chain.
