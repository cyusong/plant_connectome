Two major genes for Na(+) exclusion in durum wheat, Nax1 and Nax2, that were previously identified as the Na(+) transporters TmHKT1;4-A2 and TmHKT1;5-A, were transferred into bread wheat in order to increase its capacity to restrict the accumulation of Na(+) in leaves. The genes were crossed from tetraploid durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) into hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) by interspecific crossing and marker-assisted selection for hexaploid plants containing one or both genes. Nax1 decreased the leaf blade Na(+) concentration by 50%, Nax2 decreased it by 30%, and both genes together decreased it by 60%. The signature phenotype of Nax1, the retention of Na(+) in leaf sheaths resulting in a high Na(+) sheath:blade ratio, was found in the Nax1 lines. This conferred an extra advantage under a combination of waterlogged and saline conditions. The effect of Nax2 on lowering the Na(+) concentration in bread wheat was surprising as this gene is very similar to the TaHKT1;5-D Na(+) transporter already present in bread wheat, putatively at the Kna1 locus. The results indicate that both Nax genes have the potential to improve the salt tolerance of bread wheat.

Nax1: !decreases! Leaf blade Na(+) concentration 
Nax2: !decreases! Leaf blade Na(+) concentration 
Nax1: !retains! Na(+) in leaf sheaths 
Nax2: !similar to! TaHKT1;5-D Na(+) transporter 
Nax1 & Nax2: !decrease! Leaf blade Na(+) concentration by 60% 
Nax1 & Nax2: !improve! Salt tolerance of bread wheat
