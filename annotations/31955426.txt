Plant reproductive success depends on making fertile flowers but also upon developing appropriate shoot internodes that optimally arrange and support the flowering shoot. Compared to floral morphogenesis, we understand little about the networks directing internode growth during flowering. However, new studies reveal that long-range signals, local factors, and age-dependent micoRNA-networks are all important to harmonize internode morphogenesis with shoot development. Some of the same players modulate symplastic transport to seasonally regulate internode growth in perennial species. Exploring possible hierarchical control amongst symplastic continuity, age, systemic signals and local regulators during internode morphogenesis will help elucidate the mechanisms coordinating axial growth with the wider plant body.
