['34850922', 'Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to ensure flowering in favorable  conditions for reproductive success. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana,  FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) acts as a central repressor of flowering and the major  determinant for winter cold requirement for flowering. FLC is activated in winter  annuals by the FRIGIDA (FRI) activator complex containing FRI, FLC EXPRESSOR  (FLX), and FLX-LIKE 4 (FLX4), among which FLX and FLX4 are also essential for  establishing basal FLC expression in summer annuals. Here we show that a plant  RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphatase, C-TERMINAL DOMAIN  PHOSPHATASE-LIKE 3 (CPL3), interacts with and dephosphorylates FLX4 through their  scaffold protein FLX to inhibit flowering. CPL3-mediated dephosphorylation of  FLX4 serves as a key molecular switch that enables binding of dephosphorylated  FLX4 to the FLC locus to promote FLC expression, thus repressing flowering in  both winter and summer annuals of Arabidopsis. Our findings reveal a molecular  switch underlying the activation of FLC for flowering time control.', '2022 Feb 3', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab286', 'ORCID:']
