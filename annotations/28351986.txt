['28351986', 'In plants, cold temperatures trigger stress responses and long-term responses  that result in cold tolerance. In Arabidopsis thaliana, three  dehydration-responsive element (DRE) binding protein 1/C-repeat binding factors  (DREB1/CBFs) act as master switches in cold-responsive gene expression. Induction  of DREB1 genes triggers the cold stress-inducible transcriptional cascade,  followed by the induction of numerous genes that function in the cold stress  response and cold tolerance. Many regulatory factors involved in DREB1 induction  have been identified, but how these factors orchestrate the cold stress-specific  expression of DREB1s has not yet been clarified. Here, we revealed that plants  recognize cold stress as two different signals, rapid and gradual temperature  decreases, and induce expression of the DREB1 genes. CALMODULIN BINDING  TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR3 (CAMTA3) and CAMTA5 respond to a rapid decrease in  temperature and induce the expression of DREB1s, but these proteins do not  respond to a gradual decrease in temperature. Moreover, they function during the  day and night, in contrast to some key circadian components, including CIRCADIAN  CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL, which regulate cold-responsive  DREB1 expression as transcriptional activators only during the day. Thus, plants  efficiently control the acquisition of freezing tolerance using two different  signaling pathways in response to a gradual temperature decrease during seasonal  changes and a sudden temperature drop during the night.', '2017 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00669', 'ORCID:']
