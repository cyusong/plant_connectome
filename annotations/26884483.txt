['26884483', 'DNA damage responses have evolved to sense and react to DNA damage; the induction  of DNA repair mechanisms can lead to genomic restoration or, if the damaged DNA  cannot be adequately repaired, to the execution of a cell death program. In this  work, we investigated the role of an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein,  AtPDCD5, which is highly similar to the human PDCD5 protein; it is induced by  ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation and participates in programmed cell death in the  UV-B DNA damage response. Transgenic plants expressing AtPDCD5 fused to GREEN  FLUORESCENT PROTEIN indicate that AtPDCD5 is localized both in the nucleus and  the cytosol. By use of pdcd5 mutants, we here demonstrate that these plants have  an altered antioxidant metabolism and accumulate higher levels of DNA damage  after UV-B exposure, similar to levels in ham1ham2 RNA interference transgenic  lines with decreased expression of acetyltransferases from the MYST family. By  coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, we provide evidence that AtPDCD5  interacts with HAM proteins, suggesting that both proteins participate in the  same pathway of DNA damage responses. Plants overexpressing AtPDCD5 show less DNA  damage but more cell death in root tips upon UV-B exposure. Finally, we here show  that AtPDCD5 also participates in age-induced programmed cell death. Together,  the data presented here demonstrate that AtPDCD5 plays an important role during  DNA damage responses induced by UV-B radiation in Arabidopsis and also  participates in programmed cell death programs.', '2016 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.00033', 'ORCID:']
