Seed development depends on coordination among embryo, endosperm and seed coat. Endosperm undergoes nuclear division soon after fertilization, whereas embryo remains quiescent for a while. Such a developmental sequence is of great importance for proper seed development. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Recent results on the cellular domain- and stage-specific expression of invertase genes in cotton and Arabidopsis revealed that cell wall invertase may positively and specifically regulate nuclear division of endosperm after fertilization, thereby playing a role in determining the sequential development of endosperm and embryo, probably through glucose signaling.

Cell wall invertase: !positively regulates! Nuclear division of endosperm
Cell wall invertase: !determines! Sequential development of endosperm and embryo
Glucose signaling: !plays a role in! Determining the sequential development of endosperm and embryo
