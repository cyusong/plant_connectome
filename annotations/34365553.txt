Riboside type cytokinins are key components in cytokinin metabolism, transport, and sensitivity, making them important functional signals in plant growth and development and environmental stress responses. Cytokinin (CKs) are phytohormones that regulate multiple processes in plants and are critical for agronomy, as they are involved in seed filling and plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. Among the over 30 identified CKs, there is uncertainty about the roles of many of the individual CK structural forms. Cytokinin free bases (CKFBs), have been studied in great detail, but, by comparison, roles of riboside-type CKs (CKRs) in CK metabolism and associated signaling pathways and their distal impacts on plant physiology remain largely unknown. Here, recent findings on CKR abundance, transport and localization, are summarized, and their importance in planta is discussed. The history of CKR analyses is reviewed, in the context of the determination of CK metabolic pathways, and research on CKR affinity for CK receptors, all of which yield essential insights into their functions. Recent studies suggest that CKR forms are a lot more than a group of transport CKs and, beyond this, they play important roles in plant development and responses to environmental stress. In this context, this review discusses the involvement of CKRs in plant development, and highlight the less anticipated functions of CKRs in abiotic stress tolerance. Based on this, possible mechanisms for CKR modes of action are proposed and experimental approaches to further uncover their roles and future biotechnological applications are suggested.
