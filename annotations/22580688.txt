Symbiotic legume-rhizobia relationship leads to the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules. Successful nodulation depends on the expression and cross-talk of a batttery of genes, among them SymRK (symbiosis receptor-like kinase), a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase. SymRK is required for the rhizobia invasion of root hairs, as well as for the infection thread and symbiosome formation. Using immunolocalization and downregulation strategies we have recently provided evidence of a new function of PvSymRK in nodulation. We have found that a tight regulation of PvSymRK expression is required for the accurate development of the vascular bundle system in Phaseolus vulgaris nodules.
