['26645252', 'To ensure an adequate organ mass, the daughters of stem cells progress through a  transit-amplifying phase displaying rapid cell division cycles before  differentiating. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana microRNA miR396  regulates the transition of root stem cells into transit-amplifying cells by  interacting with GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs (GRFs). The GRFs are expressed in  transit-amplifying cells but are excluded from the stem cells through inhibition  by miR396. Inactivation of the GRFs increases the meristem size and induces  periclinal formative divisions in transit-amplifying cells. The GRFs repress  PLETHORA (PLT) genes, regulating their spatial expression gradient. Conversely,  PLT activates MIR396 in the stem cells to repress the GRFs. We identified a  pathway regulated by GRF transcription factors that represses stem cell-promoting  genes in actively proliferating cells, which is essential for the progression of  the cell cycle and the orientation of the cell division plane. If unchecked, the  expression of the GRFs in the stem cell niche suppresses formative cell divisions  and distorts the organization of the quiescent center. We propose that the  interactions identified here between miR396 and GRF and PLT transcription factors  are necessary to establish the boundary between the stem cell niche and the  transit-amplifying region.', '2015 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00452', 'ORCID:']
