['22247249', 'The proper timing of flowering is of crucial importance for reproductive success  of plants. Regulation of flowering is orchestrated by inputs from both  environmental and endogenous signals such as daylength, light quality,  temperature and hormones, and key flowering regulators construct several parallel  and interactive genetic pathways. This integrative regulatory network has been  proposed to create robustness as well as plasticity of the regulation. Although  knowledge of key genes and their regulation has been accumulated, there still  remains much to learn about how they are organized into an integrative regulatory  network. Here, we have analyzed the CRYPTIC PRECOCIOUS (CRP) gene for the  Arabidopsis counterpart of the MED12 subunit of the Mediator. A novel dominant  mutant, crp-1D, which causes up-regulation of SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF  CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), FRUITFULL (FUL) and APETALA1 (AP1) expression in a FLOWERING  LOCUS T (FT)-dependent manner, was identified in an enhancer screen of the  early-flowering phenotype of 35S::FT. Genetic and molecular analysis of both  crp-1D and crp loss-of-function alleles showed that MED12/CRP is required not  only for proper regulation of SOC1, FUL and AP1, but also for up-regulation of  FT, TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) and FD, and down-regulation of FLOWERING LOCUS C  (FLC). These observations suggest that MED12/CRP is a novel flowering regulator  with multiple regulatory target steps both upstream and downstream of the key  flowering regulators including FT florigen. Our work, taken together with recent  studies of other Mediator subunit genes, supports an emerging view that the  Mediator plays multiple roles in the regulation of flowering.', '2012 Feb', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcs002', 'Araki']
