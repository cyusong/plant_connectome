Nitrogen and CO<sub>2</sub> supply interactively regulate whole plant nitrogen partitioning and root anatomical and morphological development in tomato plants. Nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) are the key elements in plant growth and constitute the majority of plant dry matter. Growing at CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment has the potential to stimulate the growth of C<sub>3</sub> plants, however, growth is often limited by N availability. Thus, the interactive effects of CO<sub>2</sub> under different N fertilization rates can affect growth, acclimation to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and yield. However, the majority of research in this field has focused on shoot traits, while neglecting plants' hidden half-the roots. We hypothesize that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and low N effects on transpiration will interactively affect root vascular development and plant N partitioning. Here we studied the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and N concentrations on greenhouse-grown tomato plants, a C<sub>3</sub> crop. Our main objective was to determine in what manner the N fertilization rate and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> affected root development and nitrogen partitioning among plant organs. Our results indicate that N interacting with the CO<sub>2</sub> level affects the development of the root system in terms of the length, anatomy, and partitioning of the N concentration between the roots and shoot. Both CO<sub>2</sub> and N concentrations were found to affect xylem size in an opposite manner, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> found to repressed, whereas ample N stimulated xylem development. We found that under limiting N and eCO<sub>2</sub>, the N% increase in the root, while it decreased in the shoot. Under eCO<sub>2</sub>, the root system size increased with a coordinated decrease in root xylem area. We suggest that tomato root response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> depends on N fertilization rates, and that a decrease in xylem size is a possible underlying response that limits nitrogen allocation from the root into the shoot. Additionally, the greater abundance of root amino acids suggests increased root nitrogen metabolism at eCO<sub>2</sub> conditions with ample N.
