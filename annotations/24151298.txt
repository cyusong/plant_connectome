['24151298', 'Angiosperms require light for chlorophyll biosynthesis because one reaction in  the pathway, the reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide, is  catalyzed by the light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Here,  we report that Cell growth defect factor1 (Cdf1), renamed here as chaperone-like  protein of POR1 (CPP1), an essential protein for chloroplast development, plays a  role in the regulation of POR stability and function. Cdf1/CPP1 contains a J-like  domain and three transmembrane domains, is localized in the thylakoid and  envelope membranes, and interacts with POR isoforms in chloroplasts. CPP1 can  stabilize POR proteins with its holdase chaperone activity. CPP1 deficiency  results in diminished POR protein accumulation and defective chlorophyll  synthesis, leading to photobleaching and growth inhibition of plants under light  conditions. CPP1 depletion also causes reduced POR accumulation in etioplasts of  dark-grown plants and as a result impairs the formation of prolamellar bodies,  which subsequently affects chloroplast biogenesis upon illumination. Furthermore,  in cyanobacteria, the CPP1 homolog critically regulates POR accumulation and  chlorophyll synthesis under high-light conditions, in which the dark-operative  Pchlide oxidoreductase is repressed by its oxygen sensitivity. These findings and  the ubiquitous presence of CPP1 in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms suggest the  conserved nature of CPP1 function in the regulation of POR.', '2013 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.111096', 'Pai']
