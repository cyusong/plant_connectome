<i>Colletotrichum</i> is a fungal genus (Ascomycota, Sordariomycetes, Glomerellaceae) that includes many economically important plant pathogens that cause devastating diseases of a wide range of plants. In this work, using a combination of long- and short-read sequencing technologies, we sequenced the genome of <i>Colletotrichum lupini</i> RB221, isolated from white lupin (<i>Lupinus albus</i>) in France during a survey in 2014. The genome was assembled into 11 nuclear chromosomes and a mitochondrial genome with a total assembly size of 63.41 Mb and 36.55 kb, respectively. In total, 18,324 protein-encoding genes have been predicted, of which only 39 are specific to <i>C. lupini</i>. This resource will provide insight into pathogenicity factors and will help provide a better understanding of the evolution and genome structure of this important plant pathogen.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
