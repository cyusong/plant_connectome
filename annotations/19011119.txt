['19011119', 'The formation of abnormal amino acid residues is a major source of spontaneous  age-related protein damage in cells. The protein l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase  (PIMT) combats protein misfolding resulting from l-isoaspartyl formation by  catalyzing the conversion of abnormal l-isoaspartyl residues to their normal  l-aspartyl forms. In this way, the PIMT repair enzyme system contributes to  longevity and survival in bacterial and animal kingdoms. Despite the discovery of  PIMT activity in plants two decades ago, the role of this enzyme during plant  stress adaptation and in seed longevity remains undefined. In this work, we have  isolated Arabidopsis thaliana lines exhibiting altered expression of PIMT1, one  of the two genes encoding the PIMT enzyme in Arabidopsis. PIMT1 overaccumulation  reduced the accumulation of l-isoaspartyl residues in seed proteins and increased  both seed longevity and germination vigor. Conversely, reduced PIMT1 accumulation  was associated with an increase in the accumulation of l-isoaspartyl residues in  the proteome of freshly harvested dry mature seeds, thus leading to heightened  sensitivity to aging treatments and loss of seed vigor under stressful  germination conditions. These data implicate PIMT1 as a major endogenous factor  that limits abnormal l-isoaspartyl accumulation in seed proteins, thereby  improving seed traits such as longevity and vigor. The PIMT repair pathway likely  works in concert with other anti-aging pathways to actively eliminate deleterious  protein products, thus enabling successful seedling establishment and  strengthening plant proliferation in natural environments.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.058479', 'Grappin']
