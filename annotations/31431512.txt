Most characterized plant resistance proteins belong to the nucleotide-binding domain and Leu-rich repeat-containing (NLR) family. NLRs are present in an auto-inhibited state in the absence of specific pathogens, while gain-of-function mutations in NLRs usually cause autoimmunity. Here, we show that a gain-of-function mutation, <i>weaker defense</i> (<i>wed</i>), which caused a Phe-to-Leu substitution in the nucleotide-binding domain of a typical NLR in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), led to enhanced susceptibility to <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>Oryzae</i> The unexpected accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), along with downregulation of <i>NONEXPRESSOR OF PR1</i> (<i>NPR1</i>), in <i>wed</i> indicates the potential presence of a feedback regulation loop of SA biosynthesis in rice. Epistasis analyses illustrated that SA accumulation and the NLR-associated components RAR1, OsRac1, and PhyB are dispensable for the <i>wed</i> phenotypes. Intriguingly, besides pattern-triggered immunity, effector-triggered immunity conferred by different resistance proteins, including Xa3/Xa26, Xa4, and Xa21, was also disturbed by <i>wed</i> to a certain extent, indicating the existence of shared regulatory mechanisms for various defense systems. The identification of <i>wed</i> therefore provides a unique system for genetic dissection of shared immune signaling pathways activated by different types of immune receptors.
