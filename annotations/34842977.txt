OsVDE, a lipocalin-like protein in chloroplasts, negatively regulated the ABA biosynthesis and stomatal closure under salt stress in rice seedlings. Violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) is a key enzyme of xanthophyll cycle. It plays a critical role in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, growth and stress responses in plants. Although functions of several VDE genes have been characterized, it is largely unknown whether OsVDE regulates the ABA biosynthesis and salt stress tolerance in rice. In this study, we generated the OsVDE overexpressing and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene-editing transgenic lines, and identified that the gene-editing mutant lines showed the dwarfism, shorter panicle and lower seed-setting rate than the wild type whereas the overexpression lines did not exhibit the difference from the wild type. In addition, the gene-editing transgenic lines were hypersensitive to exogenous ABA during germination. Under salt stress, the gene-editing transgenic seedlings had a higher ABA level, higher stomatal closure percentage and higher survival rate than the wild type. The qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that OsVDE negatively regulated the OsNECD2/4/5 expressions, ABA biosynthesis and salt stress tolerance in rice seedlings. These results provide new evidence that VDE plays an essential role in ABA biosynthesis and salt stress tolerance in plants.
