Organ morphogenesis is the process of shape acquisition initiated with a small reservoir of undifferentiated cells. In plants, morphogenesis is a complex endeavor that comprises a large number of interacting elements, including mechanical stimuli, biochemical signaling, and genetic prerequisites. Because of the large body of data being produced by modern laboratories, solving this complexity requires the application of computational techniques and analyses. In the last two decades, computational models combined with wet-lab experiments have advanced our understanding of plant organ morphogenesis. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the most important achievements in the field of computational plant morphodynamics. We present a brief history from the earliest attempts to describe plant forms using algorithmic pattern generation to the evolution of quantitative cell-based models fueled by increasing computational power. We then provide an overview of the most common types of "digital plant" paradigms, and demonstrate how models benefit from diverse techniques used to describe cell growth mechanics. Finally, we highlight the development of computational frameworks designed to resolve organ shape complexity through integration of mechanical, biochemical, and genetic cues into a quantitative standardized and user-friendly environment.
