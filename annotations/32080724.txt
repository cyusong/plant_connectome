Autophagy is a universal mechanism that facilitates the degradation of unwanted cytoplasmic components in eukaryotic cells. In this review, we highlight recent developments in the investigation of the role of autophagy in lipid homeostasis in plants by comparison with algae, yeast, and animals. We consider the storage compartments that form the sources of lipids in plants, and the roles that autophagy plays in the synthesis of triacylglycerols and in the formation and maintenance of lipid droplets. We also consider the relationship between lipids and the biogenesis of autophagosomes, and the role of autophagy in the degradation of lipids in plants.
