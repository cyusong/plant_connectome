['15324671', 'Plants can grow straight or in the twisted fashion exhibited by the helical  growth of some climbing plants. Analysis of helical-growth mutants from  Arabidopsis has indicated that microtubules are involved in the expression of the  helical phenotype. Arabidopsis mutants growing with a right-handed twist have  been reported to have cortical microtubules that wind around the cell in  left-handed helices and vice versa. Microtubular involvement is further suspected  from the finding that some helical mutants are caused by single amino acid  substitutions in alpha-tubulin and because of the sensitivity of the growth  pattern to anti-microtubule drugs. Insight into the roles of microtubules in  organ elongation is anticipated from analyses of genes defined by helical  mutations. We investigated the helical growth of the Arabidopsis mutant  tortifolia1/spiral2 (tor1/spr2), which twists in a right-handed manner, and found  that this correlates with a complex reorientation of cortical microtubules. TOR1  was identified by a map-based approach; analysis of the TOR1 protein showed that  it is a member of a novel family of plant-specific proteins containing N-terminal  HEAT repeats. Recombinant TOR1 colocalizes with cortical microtubules in planta  and binds directly to microtubules in vitro. This shows that TOR1 is a novel,  plant-specific microtubule-associated protein (MAP) that regulates the  orientation of cortical microtubules and the direction of organ growth.', '2004 Aug 24', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2004.08.033', 'Schaffner']
