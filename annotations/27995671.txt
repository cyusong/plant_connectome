The timing of flowering is determined by endogenous genetic components as well as various environmental factors, such as day length, temperature, and stress. The genetic elements and molecular mechanisms that rule this process have been examined in the long-day-flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana and short-day-flowering rice (Oryza sativa). However, reviews of research on the role of those factors are limited. Here, we focused on how flowering time is influenced by nutrients, ambient temperature, drought, salinity, exogenously applied hormones and chemicals, and pathogenic microbes. In response to such stresses or stimuli, plants either begin flowering to produce seeds for the next generation or else delay flowering by slowing their metabolism. These responses vary depending upon the dose of the stimulus, the plant developmental stage, or even the cultivar that is used. Our review provides insight into how crops might be managed to increase productivity under various environmental challenges.
