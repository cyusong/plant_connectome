Among the biotic constraints to wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) production, fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, leaf rust (LR), caused by <i>Puccinia triticina</i>, and stripe rust (SR) caused by <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> are problematic fungal diseases worldwide. Each can significantly reduce grain yield while FHB causes additional food and feed safety concerns due to mycotoxin contamination of grain. Genetic resistance is the most effective and sustainable approach for managing wheat diseases. In the past 20 years, over 500 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring small to moderate effects for the different FHB resistance types have been reported in wheat. Similarly, 79 <i>Lr</i>-genes and more than 200 QTLs and 82 <i>Yr</i>-genes and 140 QTLs have been reported for seedling and adult plant LR and SR resistance, respectively. Most QTLs conferring rust resistance are race-specific generally conforming to a classical gene-for-gene interaction while resistance to FHB exhibits complex polygenic inheritance with several genetic loci contributing to one resistance type. Identification and deployment of additional genes/QTLs associated with FHB and rust resistance can expedite wheat breeding through marker-assisted and/or genomic selection to combine small-effect QTL in the gene pool. LR disease has been present in the southeast United States for decades while SR and FHB have become increasingly problematic in the past 20 years, with FHB arguably due to increased corn acreage in the region. Currently, QTLs on chromosome <i>1B</i> from Jamestown, <i>1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D, 4A, 5A</i>, and <i>6A</i> from W14, Ning7840, Ernie, Bess, Massey, NC-Neuse, and Truman, and <i>3B</i> (<i>Fhb1)</i> from Sumai 3 for FHB resistance, <i>Lr9</i>, <i>Lr10</i>, <i>Lr18</i>, <i>Lr24</i>, <i>Lr37, LrA2K</i>, and <i>Lr2K38</i> genes for LR resistance, and <i>Yr17 and YrR61</i> for SR resistance have been extensively deployed in southeast wheat breeding programs. This review aims to disclose the current status of FHB, LR, and SR diseases, summarize the genetics of resistance and breeding efforts for the deployment of FHB and rust resistance QTL on soft red winter wheat cultivars, and present breeding strategies to achieve sustainable management of these diseases in the southeast US.
