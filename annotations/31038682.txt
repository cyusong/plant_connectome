Cyanobacteria possess a sophisticated photosynthesis-based metabolism with admirable plasticity. This plasticity is possible via the deep regulation network, the thiol-redox regulations operated by thioredoxin (hereafter, Trx). In this context, we characterized the Trx-m1-deficient mutant strain of Anabaena sp., PCC 7120 (shortly named A.7120), cultivated under nitrogen limitation. Trx-m1 appears to coordinate the nitrogen response and its absence induces large changes in the proteome. Our data clearly indicate that Trx-m1 is crucial for the diazotrophic growth of A.7120. The lack of Trx-m1 resulted in a large differentiation of heterocysts (>20% of total cells), which were barely functional probably due to a weak expression of nitrogenase. In addition, heterocysts of the mutant strain did not display the usual cellular structure of nitrogen-fixative cells. This unveiled why the mutant strain was not able to grow under nitrogen starvation.
