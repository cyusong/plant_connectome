['24838976', 'CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in both  plants and animals. In dark-grown Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, COP1 targets  photomorphogenesis-promoting factors for degradation to repress  photomorphogenesis. Little is known, however, about how COP1 itself is regulated.  Here, we identify COP1 SUPPRESSOR1 (CSU1), a RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, as  a regulator of COP1. Genetic evidence demonstrates that csu1 mutations suppress  cop1-6 phenotypes completely in the dark. Furthermore, CSU1 colocalizes with COP1  in nuclear speckles and negatively regulates COP1 protein accumulation in  darkness. CSU1 can ubiquitinate COP1 in vitro and is essential for COP1  ubiquitination in vivo. Therefore, we conclude that CSU1 plays a major role in  maintaining COP1 homeostasis by targeting COP1 for ubiquitination and degradation  in dark-grown seedlings.', '2014 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.124024', 'Deng']
