Transport of proteins via the secretory pathway is controlled by a combination of signal dependent cargo selection as well as unspecific bulk flow of membranes and aqueous lumen. Using the plant vacuolar sorting receptor as model for membrane spanning proteins, we have distinguished bulk flow from signal mediated protein targeting in biosynthetic and endocytic transport routes and investigated the influence of transmembrane domain length. More specifically, long transmembrane domains seem to prevent ER retention, either by stimulating export or preventing recycling from post ER compartments. Long transmembrane domains also seem to prevent endocytic bulk flow from the plasma membrane, but the presence of specific endocytosis signals overrules this in a dominant manner.

Transport: !controlled by! Signal dependent cargo selection 
Transport: !stimulated by! Long transmembrane domains 
Transport: !overruled by! Specific endocytosis signals
