Photoinhibition is light-induced inactivation of PSII, and action spectrum measurements have shown that UV light causes photoinhibition much more efficiently than visible light. In the present study, we quantified the contribution of the UV part of sunlight in photoinhibition of PSII in leaves. Greenhouse-grown pumpkin leaves were pretreated with lincomycin to block the repair of photoinhibited PSII, and exposed to sunlight behind a UV-permeable or UV-blocking filter. Oxygen evolution and Chl fluorescence measurements showed that photoinhibition proceeds 35% more slowly under the UV-blocking than under the UV-permeable filter. Experiments with a filter that blocks UV-B but transmits UV-A and visible light revealed that UV-A light is almost fully responsible for the UV effect. The difference between leaves illuminated through a UV-blocking and UV-transparent filter disappeared when leaves of field-grown pumpkin plants were used. Thylakoids isolated from field-grown and greenhouse-grown plants were equally sensitive to UV light, and measurements of UV-induced fluorescence from leaves indicated that the protection of the field-grown plants was caused by substances that block the passage of UV light to the chloroplasts. Thus, the UV part of sunlight, especially the UV-A part, is potentially highly important in photoinhibition of PSII but the UV-screening compounds of plant leaves may offer almost complete protection against UV-induced photoinhibition.
