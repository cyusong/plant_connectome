Trees of Bombax ceiba L. could produce a large number of viable seeds in the dry-hot valleys. However, the seedling regeneration of the species is difficult in these areas as mild drought often occur repeatedly which might be followed by heat stress. However, how the repeated drought affects the subsequent drought and heat tolerance of B. ceiba is not clear. In this study, chlorophyll fluorescence, soluble sugar content and lipid metabolism were measured for the drought-treated seedlings and heat-treated seedlings with or without drought hardening. Neither the first nor third dehydration treatments affected the photosynthetic activity and soluble sugar content of B. ceiba seedlings. However, they differentially affected the fluidity of the local membranes and the levels of diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. Heat shock severely decreased the photosynthetic efficiency but drought priming reduced the effects of heat shock. Moreover, heat shock with or without drought priming had differential effects on the metabolism of soluble sugars and some lipids. In addition, the unsaturation level of membrane glycerolipids increased following heat shock for non-drought-hardened seedlings which, however, maintained for drought-hardened seedlings. The results suggest that two cycles of dehydration/recovery can affect the metabolism of some lipids during the third drought stress and may enhance the heat tolerance of B. ceiba by adjusting lipid composition and membrane fluidity.
