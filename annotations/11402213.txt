['11402213', 'We recently reported the cloning and characterization of an Arabidopsis (ecotype  Columbia) diacylglycerol acyltransferase cDNA (Zou et al., 1999) and found that  in Arabidopsis mutant line AS11, an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutation at a  locus on chromosome II designated as Tag1 consists of a 147-bp insertion in the  DNA, which results in a repeat of the 81-bp exon 2 in the Tag1 cDNA. This  insertion mutation is correlated with an altered seed fatty acid composition,  reduced diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT; EC 2.3.1.20) activity, reduced seed  triacylglycerol content, and delayed seed development in the AS11 mutant. The  effect of the insertion mutation on microsomal acyl-coenzyme A-dependent DGAT is  examined with respect to DGAT activity and its substrate specificity in the AS11  mutant relative to wild type. We demonstrate that transformation of mutant AS11  with a single copy of the wild-type Tag1 DGAT cDNA can complement the fatty acid  and reduced oil phenotype of mutant AS11. More importantly, we show for the first  time that seed-specific over-expression of the DGAT cDNA in wild-type Arabidopsis  enhances oil deposition and average seed weight, which are correlated with DGAT  transcript levels. The DGAT activity in developing seed of transgenic lines was  enhanced by 10% to 70%. Thus, the current study confirms the important role of  DGAT in regulating the quantity of seed triacylglycerols and the sink size in  developing seeds.', '2001 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.126.2.861', 'Taylor']
