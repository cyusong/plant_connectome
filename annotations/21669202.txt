['21669202', 'We have used Forster resonance energy transfer detected by fluorescence lifetime  imaging microscopy (FLIM-FRET) to provide the first evidence from living plants  cells for the existence of a flavonoid metabolon. The distribution of flux within  this system may be regulated by the direct competition of enzymes that catalyze  key branch-point reactions, flavonol synthase 1 and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase,  for association with the entry-point enzyme, chalcone synthase. Because the  flavonoid enzymes were likely recruited from pathways of primary metabolism, our  findings suggest a new general working model for the regulation of dynamic  pathways in their native cellular context.', '2011 Jul 21', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2011.05.066', 'Winkel']
