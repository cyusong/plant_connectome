The growth of the fusarium head blight (FHB) pathogen at the grain formation stage is a deadly threat to wheat production through disruption of the photosynthetic processes of wheat spikes. Real-time nondestructive and frequent proxy detection approaches are necessary to control pathogen propagation and targeted fungicide application. Therefore, this study examined the ch\lorophyll-related phenotypes or features from spectral and chlorophyll fluorescence for FHB monitoring. A methodology is developed using features extracted from hyperspectral reflectance (HR), chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (CFI), and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) for asymptomatic to symptomatic disease detection from two consecutive years of experiments. The disease-sensitive features were selected using the Boruta feature-selection algorithm, and subjected to machine learning-sequential floating forward selection (ML-SFFS) for optimum feature combination. The results demonstrated that the biochemical parameters, HR, CFI, and HTP showed consistent alterations during the spike-pathogen interaction. Among the selected disease sensitive features, reciprocal reflectance (RR=1/700) demonstrated the highest coefficient of determination (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>) of 0.81, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.1. The multivariate k-nearest neighbor model outperformed the competing multivariate and univariate models with an overall accuracy of <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.92 and RMSE = 10.21. A combination of two to three kinds of features was found optimum for asymptomatic disease detection using ML-SFFS with an average classification accuracy of 87.04% that gradually improved to 95% for a disease severity level of 20%. The study demonstrated the fusion of chlorophyll-related phenotypes with the ML-SFFS might be a good choice for crop disease detection.
