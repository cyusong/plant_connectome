['24506176', 'In meiosis, chromosome cohesion is maintained by the cohesin complex, which is  released in a two-step manner. At meiosis I, the meiosis-specific cohesin subunit  Rec8 is cleaved by the protease Separase along chromosome arms, allowing  homologous chromosome segregation. Next, in meiosis II, cleavage of the remaining  centromere cohesin results in separation of the sister chromatids. In eukaryotes,  protection of centromeric cohesion in meiosis I is mediated by SHUGOSHINs (SGOs).  The Arabidopsis genome contains two SGO homologs. Here we demonstrate that Atsgo1  mutants show a premature loss of cohesion of sister chromatid centromeres at  anaphase I and that AtSGO2 partially rescues this loss of cohesion. In addition  to SGOs, we characterize PATRONUS which is specifically required for the  maintenance of cohesion of sister chromatid centromeres in meiosis II. In  contrast to the Atsgo1 Atsgo2 double mutant, patronus T-DNA insertion mutants  only display loss of sister chromatid cohesion after meiosis I, and additionally  show disorganized spindles, resulting in defects in chromosome segregation in  meiosis. This leads to reduced fertility and aneuploid offspring. Furthermore, we  detect aneuploidy in sporophytic tissue, indicating a role for PATRONUS in  chromosome segregation in somatic cells. Thus, ploidy stability is preserved in  Arabidopsis by PATRONUS during both meiosis and mitosis.', '2014 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12432', 'Geelen']
