['23382551', 'Dehydrin is a plant disordered protein whose functions are not yet totally  understood. Here it is reported that a KS-type dehydrin can reduce the formation  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from Cu. AtHIRD11, which is the Arabidopsis  KS-type dehydrin, inhibited generation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals  in the Cu-ascorbate system. The radical-reducing activity of AtHIRD11 was  stronger than those of radical-silencing peptides such as glutathione and serum  albumin. The addition of Cu(2+) reduced the disordered state, decreased the  trypsin susceptibility, and promoted the self-association of AtHIRD11. Domain  analyses indicated that the five domains containing histidine showed ROS-reducing  activities. Histidine/alanine substitutions indicated that histidine is a crucial  residue for reducing ROS generation. Using the 27 peptides which are related to  the KnS-type dehydrins of 14 plant species, it was found that the strengths of  ROS-reducing activities can be determined by two factors, namely the histidine  contents and the length of the peptides. The degree of ROS-reducing activities of  a dehydrin can be predicted using these indices.', '2013 Apr', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ert016', 'Kato']
