The idea of common pathways guiding different fates is an emerging concept in plant development, and epidermal cell-fate specification in Arabidopsis thaliana is an excellent example to illustrate it. In the root epidermis, both hair patterning and differentiation depend on a complex interaction between both negative (WER, TTG, GL3, EGL3, and GL2) and positive (CPC, TRY, and ETC1) regulators of hair cell fate. These regulators pattern and differentiate hairs through a bi-directional signalling mechanism. The same molecular components (WER, TTG, GL3, EGL3, and GL2) seem to be involved in the patterning of stomata in the embryonic stem. However, the possible role of CPC, TRY, and ETC1 on stomatal patterning and/or differentiation has not been studied, questioning whether they, and the underlying bi-directional mechanism, guide patterning formation and differentiation in the hypocotyl.
