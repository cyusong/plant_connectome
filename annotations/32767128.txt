The nuclear-localized CAX-interacting protein VvCXIP4 is exported to the cytosol after a Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulse, to activate the tonoplast-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger VvCAX3. Vacuolar cation/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers (CAXs) have long been recognized as 'housekeeping' components in cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and trace metal homeostasis, being involved in a range of key cellular and physiological processes. However, the mechanisms that drive functional activation of the transporters are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the function of a putative grapevine CAX-interacting protein, VvCXIP4, by testing its ability to activate VvCAX3, previously characterized as a tonoplast-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger. VvCAX3 contains an autoinhibitory domain that drives inactivation of the transporter and thus, is incapable of suppressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-hypersensitive phenotype of the S. cerevisiae mutant K667. In this study, the co-expression of VvCXIP4 and VvCAX3 in this strain efficiently rescued its growth defect at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Flow cytometry experiments showed that yeast harboring both proteins effectively accumulated higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels than cells expressing each of the proteins separately. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays allowed visualization of the direct interaction between the proteins in tobacco plants and in yeast, and also showed the self-interaction of VvCAX3 but not of VvCXIP4. Subcellular localization studies showed that, despite being primarily localized to the nucleus, VvCXIP4 is able to move to other cell compartments upon a Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulus, becoming prone to interaction with the tonoplast-localized VvCAX3. qPCR analysis showed that both genes are more expressed in grapevine stems and leaves, followed by the roots, and that the steady-state transcript levels were higher in the pulp than in the skin of grape berries. Also, both VvCXIP4 and VvCAX3 were upregulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>, indicating they share common regulatory mechanisms. However, VvCXIP4 was also upregulated by Li<sup>+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and its expression increased steadily throughout grape berry development, contrary to VvCAX3, suggesting additional physiological roles for VvCXIP4, including the regulation of VvCAXs not yet functionally characterized. The main novelty of the present study was the demonstration of physical interaction between CXIP and CAX proteins from a woody plant model by BiFC assays, demonstrating the intracellular mobilization of CXIPs in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
