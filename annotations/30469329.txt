Plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses is complicated by interactions between different stresses. Maintaining crop yield under abiotic stresses is the most daunting challenge for breeding resilient crop varieties. In response to environmental stresses, plants produce several metabolites, such as proline (Pro), polyamines (PAs), asparagine, serine, carbohydrates including glucose and fructose, and pools of antioxidant reactive oxygen species. Among these metabolites, Pro has long been known to accumulate in cells and to be closely related to drought, salt, and pathogen resistance. Pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) is a common intermediate of Pro synthesis and metabolism that is produced by ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), an enzyme that functions in an alternative Pro metabolic pathway in the mitochondria under stress conditions. OAT is highly conserved and, to date, has been found in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In addition, ornithine (Orn) and arginine (Arg) are both precursors of PAs, which confer plant resistance to drought and salt stresses. OAT is localized in the cytosol in prokaryotes and fungi, while OAT is localized in the mitochondria in higher plants. We have comprehensively reviewed the research on Orn, Arg, and Pro metabolism in plants, as all these compounds allow plants to tolerate different kinds of stresses.
