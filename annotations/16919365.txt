The protective effects of polyamines (PAs) against copper (Cu) toxicity were investigated in the leaves of Nymphoides peltatum. Cu treatment increased the putrescine (Put) level and lowered spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) levels, thereby reducing the (Spd+Spm)/Put ratio in leaves. Exogenous application of Spd or Spm markedly reversed these Cu-induced effects for all three PAs and partially restored the (Spd+Spm)/Put ratio in leaves. It also significantly enhanced the level of proline, retarded the loss of soluble protein, decreased the rate of O2*- generation and H2O2 content, and prevented Cu-induced lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, exogenous Spd and Spm reduced the accumulation of Cu and effectively maintained the balance of nutrient elements in plant leaves under Cu stress. These results suggest that exogenous application of Spd or Spm can enhance the tolerance of N. peltatum to Cu by increasing the levels of endogenous Spd and Spm as well as the (Spd+Spm)/Put ratio.
