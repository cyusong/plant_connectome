['34791448', 'Primary metabolism provides energy for growth and development as well as  secondary metabolites for diverse environmental responses. Here we describe an  unexpected consequence of disruption of a glycolytic enzyme enolase named LOW  EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE 2 (LOS2) in causing constitutive  defense responses or autoimmunity in Arabidopsis thaliana. The autoimmunity in  the los2 mutant is accompanied by a higher expression of about one-quarter of  intracellular immune receptor nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes  in the genome and is partially dependent on one of these NLR genes. The LOS2 gene  was hypothesized to produce an alternatively translated protein c-Myc Binding  Protein (MBP-1) that functions as a transcriptional repressor. Complementation  tests show that LOS2 executes its function in growth and immunity regulation  through the canonical enolase activity but not the production of MBP-1. In  addition, the autoimmunity in the los2 mutants leads to a higher accumulation of  sugars and organic acids and a depletion of glycolytic metabolites. These  findings indicate that LOS2 does not exert its function in immune responses  through an alternatively translated protein MBP-1. Rather, they show that a  perturbation of glycolysis from the reduction of the enolase activity results in  activation of NLR-involved immune responses which further influences primary  metabolism and plant growth, highlighting the complex interaction between primary  metabolism and plant immunity.', '2022 Apr 26', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab283', 'ORCID:']
