The SCF complex is a widely studied multi-subunit ring E3 ubiquitin ligase that tags targeted proteins with ubiquitin for protein degradation by the ubiquitin 26S-proteasome system (UPS). The UPS is an important system that generally keeps cellular events tightly regulated by purging misfolded or damaged proteins and selectively degrading important regulatory proteins. The specificity of this post-translational regulation is controlled by F-box proteins (FBPs) via selective recognition of a protein-protein interaction motif at the C-terminal domain. Hence, FBPs are pivotal proteins in determining the plant response in multiple scenarios. It is not surprising that the FBP family is one of the largest protein families in the plant kingdom. In this review, the roles of FBPs, specifically in plants, are compiled to provide insights into their involvement in secondary metabolites, plant stresses, phytohormone signalling, plant developmental processes and miRNA biogenesis.
