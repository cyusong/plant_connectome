Although it is known that in most angiosperms mitosis in early endosperm development is syncytial and synchronized, it is unclear how the synchronization is regulated. We showed previously that APC11, also named ZYG1, in Arabidopsis activates zygote division by interaction and degradation of cyclin B1. Here, we report that the mutation in APC11/ZYG1 led to unsynchronized mitosis and over-accumulation of cyclin B1-GUS in the endosperm. Mutations in two other APC subunits showed similar defects. Transgenic expression of stable cyclin B1 in the endosperm also caused unsynchronized mitosis. Further, downregulation of APC11 generated multi-nucleate somatic cells with unsynchronized mitotic division. Together, our results suggest that APC/C-mediated cyclin B1 degradation is critical for cell cycle synchronization.
