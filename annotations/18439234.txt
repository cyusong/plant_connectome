Petiole curvature is important in regulating light interception by the leaf. To dissect the determination processes of leaf angle, we irradiated the lamina or petiole of Chenopodium album L. with either one or two spots of actinic light, after dark adaptation. When the abaxial side of the petiole was irradiated with blue light, the petiole curvature increased, and under continuous irradiation, the curvature continued for up to 6 h. The rate of curvature increased with increasing blue light intensity. The curvature induced by irradiation of the abaxial side with blue light ceased when the adaxial side of the petiole was simultaneously irradiated with either blue or red light. When an inhibitor for photosynthesis, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, was applied to the adaxial side of the petiole, the cessation of curvature caused by blue light was only weakly inhibited, while the cessation caused by red light was markedly inhibited. When the adaxial side of the petiole was irradiated alternately with red and far-red light, the far-red light antagonized the cessation of curvature caused by the red light. These results clearly show that the petiole curvature is controlled by two processes, the induction and the cessation of curvature. At least three photoreceptor systems, blue-light receptor, photosynthesis and phytochrome, are involved in the reactions.

blue light: !induces! petiole curvature
red light: !ceases! petiole curvature
3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea: !inhibits! cessation of curvature caused by red light
far-red light: !antagonizes! cessation of curvature caused by red light
blue-light receptor: !involved in! induction and cessation of curvature
photosynthesis: !involved in! induction and cessation of curvature
phytochrome: !involved in! induction and cessation of curvature
