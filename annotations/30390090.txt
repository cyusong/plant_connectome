Plants have evolved dynamic and complex networks of cell-to-cell communication to coordinate and adapt their growth and development to a variety of environmental changes. In addition to small molecules, such as metabolites and phytohormones, macromolecules such as proteins and RNAs also act as signalling agents in plants. As information molecules, RNAs can move locally between cells through plasmodesmata, and over long distances through phloem. Non-cell-autonomous RNAs may act as mobile signals to regulate plant development, nutrient allocation, gene silencing, antiviral defence, stress responses and many other physiological processes in plants. Recent work has shed light on mobile RNAs and, in some cases, uncovered their roles in intercellular and systemic signalling networks. This review summarizes the current knowledge of local and systemic RNA movement, and discusses the potential regulatory mechanisms and biological significance of RNA trafficking in plants.
