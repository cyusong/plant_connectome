['19136569', 'While the presence of a complete shikimate pathway within plant plastids is  definitively established, the existence of a cytosolic postchorismate portion of  the pathway is still debated. This question is alimented by the presence of a  chorismate mutase (CM) within the cytosol. Until now, the only known destiny of  prephenate, the product of CM, is incorporation into tyrosine (Tyr) and/or  phenylalanine (Phe). Therefore, the presence of a cytosolic CM suggests that  enzymes involved downstream of CM in Tyr or Phe biosynthesis could be present  within the cytosol of plant cells. It was thus of particular interest to clarify  the subcellular localization of arogenate dehydrogenases (TYRAs) and arogenate  dehydratases (ADTs), which catalyze the ultimate steps in Tyr and Phe  biosynthesis, respectively. The aim of this study was to address this question in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) by analysis of the subcellular localization of  the two TYRAAts and the six AtADTs. This article excludes the occurrence of a  spliced TYRAAt1 transcript encoding a cytosolic TYRA protein. Transient  expression analyses of TYRA- and ADT-green fluorescent protein fusions reveal  that the two Arabidopsis TYRA proteins and the six ADT proteins are all targeted  within the plastid. Accordingly, TYRA and ADT proteins were both immunodetected  in the chloroplast soluble protein fraction (stroma) of Arabidopsis. No TYRA or  ADT proteins were immunodetected in the cytosol of Arabidopsis cells. Taken  together, all our data exclude the possibility of Tyr and/or Phe synthesis within  the cytosol, at least in green leaves and Arabidopsis cultured cells.', '2009 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.130070', 'Matringe']
