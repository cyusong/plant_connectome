Grain number and size are interactive agronomic traits that determine grain yield. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for coordinating the trade-off between these traits remain elusive. Here, we characterized the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>grain size and number1</i> (<i>gsn1</i>) mutant, which has larger grains but sparser panicles than the wild type due to disordered localized cell differentiation and proliferation. <i>GSN1</i> encodes the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase OsMKP1, a dual-specificity phosphatase of unknown function. Reduced expression of <i>GSN1</i> resulted in larger and fewer grains, whereas increased expression resulted in more grains but reduced grain size. GSN1 directly interacts with and inactivates the mitogen-activated protein kinase OsMPK6 via dephosphorylation. Consistent with this finding, the suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase genes <i>OsMPK6</i>, <i>OsMKK4</i>, and <i>OsMKKK10</i> separately resulted in denser panicles and smaller grains, which rescued the mutant <i>gsn1</i> phenotypes. Therefore, OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 participates in panicle morphogenesis and acts on a common pathway in rice. We confirmed that GSN1 is a negative regulator of the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 cascade that determines panicle architecture. The GSN1-MAPK module coordinates the trade-off between grain number and grain size by integrating localized cell differentiation and proliferation. These findings provide important insights into the developmental plasticity of the panicle and a potential means to improve crop yields.
