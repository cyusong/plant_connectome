['22704988', 'Lignin is the defining constituent of wood and the second most abundant natural  polymer on earth. Lignin is produced by the oxidative coupling of three  monolignols: p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol.  Monolignols are synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway and eventually  polymerized in the cell wall by peroxidases and laccases. However, the mechanism  whereby monolignols are transported from the cytosol to the cell wall has  remained elusive. Here we report the discovery that AtABCG29, an ATP-binding  cassette transporter, acts as a p-coumaryl alcohol transporter. Expression of  AtABCG29 promoter-driven reporter genes and a Citrine-AtABCG29 fusion construct  revealed that AtABCG29 is targeted to the plasma membrane of the root endodermis  and vascular tissue. Moreover, yeasts expressing AtABCG29 exhibited an increased  tolerance to p-coumaryl alcohol by excreting this monolignol. Vesicles isolated  from yeasts expressing AtABCG29 exhibited a p-coumaryl alcohol transport  activity. Loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutants contained less lignin subunits and  were more sensitive to p-coumaryl alcohol. Changes in secondary metabolite  profiles in abcg29 underline the importance of regulating p-coumaryl alcohol  levels in the cytosol. This is the first identification of a monolignol  transporter, closing a crucial gap in our understanding of lignin biosynthesis,  which could open new directions for lignin engineering.', '2012 Jul 10', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.064', 'Martinoia']
