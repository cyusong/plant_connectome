Plant roots possess remarkable regenerative potential owing to their ability to replenish damaged or lost stem cells. ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 (ERF115), one of the key molecular elements linked to this potential, plays a predominant role in the activation of regenerative cell divisions. However, the downstream operating molecular machinery driving wound-activated cell division is largely unknown. Here, we biochemically and genetically identified the GRAS-domain transcription factor SCARECROW-LIKE 5 (SCL5) as an interaction partner of ERF115 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Although non-essential under control growth conditions, SCL5 acts redundantly with the related PHYTOCHROME A SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION 1 (PAT1) and SCL21 transcription factors to activate the expression of the DNA-BINDING ONE FINGER 3.4 (DOF3.4) transcription factor gene. DOF3.4 expression is wound-inducible in an ERF115-dependent manner, and in turn activates D3-type cyclin expression. Accordingly, ectopic DOF3.4 expression drives periclinal cell division, while its downstream D3-type cyclins are essential for the regeneration of a damaged root. Our data highlight the importance and redundant roles of the SCL5, SCL21 and PAT1 transcription factors in wound-activated regeneration processes and pinpoint DOF3.4 as a key downstream element driving regenerative cell division.
