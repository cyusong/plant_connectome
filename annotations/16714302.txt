Considerable effort has been expended on understanding the genetic networks that regulate leaf development and morphology, however, less attention has been given to the role of leaf carbon status in modulating the plant developmental programme. Unexpected changes in plant development have been observed in response to changes in leaf metabolism. The focus of this review will be to discuss how manipulation of leaf carbon metabolic pathways, such as the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle and trehalose biosynthesis, has provided insights into links between metabolism and development.
