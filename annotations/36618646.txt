Wilt disease caused by <i>Phytophthora melonis</i> infection is one of the most serious threats to <i>Benincasa hispida</i> production. However, the mechanism of the response of <i>B. hispida</i> to a <i>P. melonis</i> infection remains largely unknown. In the present study, two <i>B. hispida</i> cultivars with different degrees of resistance to <i>P. melonis</i> were identified: B488 (a moderately resistant cultivar) and B214 (a moderately susceptible cultivar). RNA-seq was performed on <i>P. melonis</i>-infected B488 and B214 12 hours post infection (hpi). Compared with the control, 680 and 988 DEGs were respectively detected in B488 and B214. A KEGG pathway analysis combined with a cluster analysis revealed that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant-pathogen interaction, the MAPK signaling pathway-plant, and plant hormone signal transduction were the most relevant pathways during the response of both B488 and B214 to <i>P. melonis</i> infection, as well as the differentially expressed genes in the two cultivars. In addition, a cluster analysis of transcription factor genes in DEGs identified four genes upregulated in B488 but not in B214 at 6 hpi and 12 hpi, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR. These were candidate genes for elucidating the mechanism of the <i>B. hispida</i> response to <i>P. melonis</i> infection and laying the foundation for the improvement of <i>B. hispida</i>.
