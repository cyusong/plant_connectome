Comparative mitogenomics of <i>Ulva</i> species have revealed remarkable variations in genome size due to the integration of exogenous DNA fragments, the proliferation of group I/II introns, and the change of repeat sequences. The genus <i>Ulva</i> is a species-rich taxonomic group, containing a variety of green-tide forming algae. In this study, five complete mitogenomes of the green-tide forming macroalga, <i>Ulva meridionalis</i> R. Horimoto and S. Shimada, were assembled and compared with the available ulvophyceae mtDNAs. The main circular mitogenomes of <i>U. meridionalis</i> ranged from 82.94 to 111.49 kb in size, and its 111.49-kb mitogenome was the largest <i>Ulva</i> mitogenome sequenced so far. The expansion of <i>U. meridionalis</i> mitogenomes is mainly due to the tandem integration of a 5.36-kb mitochondrial circular plasmid (pUme), as well as the proliferation of introns. An intact DNA-directed RNA polymerase gene (<i>rpo</i>) was present in pUme of <i>U. meridionalis</i> and was then detected in two putative plasmids (pUmu1 and pUmu2) found in <i>Ulva mutabilis</i>. The observed integration of the circular plasmid into <i>U. meridionalis</i> mitogenomes seems to occur <i>via</i> homologous recombination, and is a more recent evolutionary event. Many highly homologous sequences of these three putative plasmids can be detected in the other <i>Ulva</i> mtDNAs sequenced thus far, indicating the integration of different mitochondrial plasmid DNA into the mitogenomes is a common phenomenon in the evolution of <i>Ulva</i> mitogenomes. The random incidence of destruction of plasmid-derived <i>rpo</i>s and open reading frames (<i>orf</i>s) suggests that their existence is not the original characteristic of <i>Ulva</i> mitogenomes and there is no selective pressure to maintain their integrity. The frequent integration and rapid divergence of plasmid-derived sequences is one of the most important evolutionary forces to shape the diversity of <i>Ulva</i> mitogenomes.
