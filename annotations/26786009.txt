Aquaporins (AQPs) are intramolecular channels essential for transport of H2O, CO2, and other small substrates across membranes. Through this function, AQPs can modulate CO2 uptake and assimilation in plants and regulate water relations and many other physiological processes in all living organisms. To execute their physiological roles, AQPs may experience 3 types of hetero-molecular interaction, between AQPs and their kinases; between AQP isoforms; and between AQPs and other proteins that are neither AQPs nor kinases. Interacting with non-AQP non-kinase proteins may enable AQPs to extend their functions beyond substrate transport, and most fascinatingly, to serve as a gateway control for translocation of virulence effectors from pathogenic bacteria into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. In this mini review, we will summarize the latter 2 types of interaction and discuss the physiological and/or pathological significance. We will also discuss a research angle to elucidate the structural basis of AQP-partnering protein interactions.

AQP: !transports! H2O, CO2
AQP: !interacts with! kinases
AQP: !interacts with! AQP isoforms
AQP: !interacts with! non-AQP non-kinase proteins
AQP: !controls! translocation of virulence effectors
