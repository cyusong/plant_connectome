['16682354', 'trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) are endogenous RNAs that direct the cleavage of  complementary mRNA targets . TAS gene transcripts are cleaved by miRNAs; the  cleavage products are protected against degradation by SGS3, copied into dsRNA by  RDR6, and diced into ta-siRNAs by DCL4 . We describe hypomorphic rdr6 and sgs3  Arabidopsis mutants, which do not exhibit the leaf developmental defects observed  in null mutants and which, like null alleles, are impaired in  sense-transgene-induced posttranscriptional gene silencing and virus resistance.  Null rdr6 and sgs3 mutants lack TAS1, TAS2, and TAS3 ta-siRNAs and overaccumulate  ARF3/ETTIN and ARF4 mRNAs, which are TAS3 ta-siRNA targets. A hypomorphic rdr6  mutant accumulates wild-type TAS3 ta-siRNA levels but not TAS1 and TAS2  ta-siRNAs, suggesting that TAS3 is required for proper leaf development.  Consistently, tas3 but not tas1 or tas2 mutants exhibits leaf morphology defects,  and ago7/zip and drb4 mutants, which exhibit leaf morphology defects, lack TAS3  but not TAS1 and TAS2 ta-siRNAs in leaves. These results indicate that the dsRNA  binding protein DRB4 is required for proper ta-siRNA production, presumably by  interacting with DCL4, an interaction analogous to that of HYL1 with DCL1 during  miRNA production , and that TAS3 ta-siRNAs are required for proper leaf  development through the action of AGO7/ZIPPY.', '2006 May 9', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.035', 'Vaucheret']
