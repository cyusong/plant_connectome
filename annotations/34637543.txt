Experimental evidence that nonstomatal limitations to photosynthesis (NSLs) correlate with leaf sugar and/or leaf water status suggests the possibility that stomata adjust to maximise photosynthesis through a trade-off between leaf CO<sub>2</sub> supply and NSLs, potentially involving source-sink interactions. However, the mechanisms regulating NSLs and sink strength, as well as their implications for stomatal control, remain uncertain. We used an analytically solvable model to explore optimal stomatal control under alternative hypotheses for source and sink regulation. We assumed that either leaf sugar concentration or leaf water potential regulates NSLs, and that either phloem turgor pressure or phloem sugar concentration regulates sink phloem unloading. All hypotheses led to realistic stomatal responses to light, CO<sub>2</sub> and air humidity, including conservative behaviour for the intercellular-to-atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration ratio. Sugar-regulated and water-regulated NSLs are distinguished by the presence/absence of a stomatal closure response to changing sink strength. Turgor-regulated and sugar-regulated phloem unloading are distinguished by the presence/absence of stomatal closure under drought and avoidance/occurrence of negative phloem turgor. Results from girdling and drought experiments on Pinus sylvestris, Betula pendula, Populus tremula and Picea abies saplings are consistent with optimal stomatal control under sugar-regulated NSLs and turgor-regulated unloading. Our analytical results provide a simple representation of stomatal responses to above-ground and below-ground environmental factors and sink activity.
