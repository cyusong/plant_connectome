['14564522', 'A protein from Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. showing homology to animal  proteins of the NaPi-1 family, involved in the transport of inorganic phosphate,  chloride, glutamate and sialic acid, has been characterized. This protein, named  ANTR2 (for anion transporters) was shown by chloroplast subfractionation to be  localized to the plastid inner envelope in both A. thaliana and Spinacia oleracea  (L.). Immunolocalization revealed that ANTR2 was expressed in the leaf mesophyll  cells as well as in the developing embryo at the upturned-U stage. Five  additional homologues of ANTR2 are found in the Arabidopsis genome, of which one  was shown by green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion to be also located in the  chloroplast. All ANTR proteins share homology to the animal NaPi-1 family, as  well as to other organic-anion transporters that are members of the Anion:Cation  Symporter (ACS) family, and share the main features of transporters from this  family, including the presence of 12 putative transmembrane domains and of a  7-amino acid motif in the fourth putative transmembrane domain. ANTR2 thus  represent a novel protein of the plastid inner envelope that is likely to be  involved in anion transport.', '2004 Jan', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-003-1121-5', 'Poirier']
