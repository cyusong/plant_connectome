Ascorbate (Asc, vitamin C) is an essential metabolite participating in multiple physiological processes of plants, including environmental stress management and development. In this study, we acquired knowledge on the role of Asc in dark-induced leaf senescence using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism. One of the earliest effects of prolonged darkness is the inactivation of oxygen-evolving complexes (OEC) as demonstrated here by fast chlorophyll a fluorescence and thermoluminescence measurements. We found that inactivation of OEC due to prolonged darkness was attenuated in the Asc-deficient vtc2-4 mutant. On the other hand, the severe photosynthetic phenotype of a psbo1 knockout mutant, lacking the major extrinsic OEC subunit PSBO1, was further aggravated upon a 24-h dark treatment. The psbr mutant, devoid of the PSBR subunit of OEC, performed only slightly disturbed photosynthetic activity under normal growth conditions, whereas it showed a strongly diminished B thermoluminescence band upon dark treatment. We have also generated a double psbo1 vtc2 mutant, and it showed a slightly milder photosynthetic phenotype than the single psbo1 mutant. Our results, therefore, suggest that Asc leads to the inactivation of OEC in prolonged darkness by over-reducing the Mn-complex that is probably enabled by a dark-induced dissociation of the extrinsic OEC subunits. Our study is an example that Asc may negatively affect certain cellular processes and thus its concentration and localization need to be highly controlled.
