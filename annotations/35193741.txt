['35193741', 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play essential roles as a second messenger in  various physiological processes in plants. Due to their oxidative nature, ROS can  also be harmful. Thus, the generation and homeostasis of ROS are tightly  controlled by multiple enzymes. Membrane-localized NADPH oxidases are well known  to generate ROS during developmental and stress responses, but the metabolic  pathways of the superoxide (O2(-)) generated by them in the apoplast are poorly  understood, and the identity of the apoplastic superoxide dismutase (SOD) is  unknown in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that a putative manganese SOD, MSD2 is  secreted and possesses a SOD activity that can be inhibited by nitration at  tyrosine 68. The expression of MSD2 in roots is light condition-dependent,  suggesting that MSD2 may act on ROS metabolism in roots during the light-to-dark  transition. Root architecture is governed by ROS distribution that exhibits  opposite gradient of H(2)O(2) and O2(-), which is indeed altered in etiolated  msd2 mutants and accompanied by changes in the onset of differentiation. These  results provide a missing link in our understanding of ROS metabolism and suggest  that MSD2 plays a role in root skotomorphogenesis by regulating ROS distribution,  thereby playing a pivotal role in plant growth and development.', '2022 Apr', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.111192', 'Lee']
