RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (<i>RBR</i>) is an essential gene in plants, but its molecular function outside of its role in cell cycle entry remains poorly understood. We characterized the functions of <i>OsRBR1</i> and <i>OsRBR2</i> in plant growth and development in rice using both forward- and reverse-genetics methods. The two genes were coexpressed and performed redundant roles in vegetative organs but exhibited separate functions in flowers. <i>OsRBR1</i> was highly expressed in the floral meristem and regulated the expression of floral homeotic genes to ensure floral organ formation. Mutation of <i>OsRBR1</i> caused loss of floral meristem identity, resulting in the replacement of lodicules, stamens, and the pistil with either a panicle-like structure or whorls of lemma-like organs. <i>OsRBR2</i> was preferentially expressed in stamens and promoted pollen formation. Mutation of <i>OsRBR2</i> led to deformed anthers without pollen. Similar to the protein interaction between AtRBR and AtMSI1 that is essential for floral development in Arabidopsis, OsMSI1 was identified as an interaction partner of OsRBR1 and OsRBR2. OsMSI1 was ubiquitously expressed and appears to be essential for development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), as the mutation of <i>OsMSI1</i> was lethal. These results suggest that OsRBR1 and OsRBR2 function with OsMSI1 in reproductive development in rice. This work characterizes further functions of <i>RBR</i>s and improves current understanding of specific regulatory pathways of floral specification and pollen formation in rice.
