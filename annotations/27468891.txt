Plants have evolved complicated protective mechanisms to survive adverse conditions. Previously, we reported that the transcription factor OsbZIP46 regulates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling-mediated drought tolerance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) by modulating stress-related genes. An intrinsic D domain represses OsbZIP46 activity, but the detailed mechanism for the repression of OsbZIP46 activation remains unknown. Here, we report an OsbZIP46-interacting protein, MODD (Mediator of OsbZIP46 deactivation and degradation), which is homologous to the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 binding protein AFP. <i>MODD</i> was induced by ABA and drought stress, but the induction was much slower than that of <i>OsbZIP46</i> In contrast to OsbZIP46, MODD negatively regulates ABA signaling and drought tolerance, and inhibits the expression of OsbZIP46 target genes. We found that MODD negatively regulates OsbZIP46 activity and stability. MODD represses OsbZIP46 activity via interaction with the OsTPR3-HDA702 corepressor complex and downregulation of the histone acetylation level at OsbZIP46 target genes. MODD promotes OsbZIP46 degradation via interaction with the U-box type ubiquitin E3 ligase OsPUB70. Interestingly, the D domain is required for both deactivation and degradation of OsbZIP46 via its interaction with MODD. These findings show that plants fine-tune their drought responses by elaborate regulatory mechanisms, including the coordination of activity and stability of key transcription factors.
