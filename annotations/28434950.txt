['28434950', 'Deposition of cell wall-reinforcing papillae is an integral component of the  plant immune response. The Arabidopsis PENETRATION 3 (PEN3) ATP binding cassette  (ABC) transporter plays a role in defense against numerous pathogens and is  recruited to sites of pathogen detection where it accumulates within papillae.  However, the trafficking pathways and regulatory mechanisms contributing to  recruitment of PEN3 and other defenses to the host-pathogen interface are poorly  understood. Here, we report a confocal microscopy-based screen to identify  mutants with altered localization of PEN3-GFP after inoculation with powdery  mildew fungi. We identified a mutant, aberrant localization of PEN3 3 (alp3),  displaying accumulation of the normally plasma membrane (PM)-localized PEN3-GFP  in endomembrane compartments. The mutant was found to be disrupted in the  P(4)-ATPase AMINOPHOSPHOLIPID ATPASE 3 (ALA3), a lipid flippase that plays a  critical role in vesicle formation. We provide evidence that PEN3 undergoes  continuous endocytic cycling from the PM to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In  alp3, PEN3 accumulates in the TGN, causing delays in recruitment to the  host-pathogen interface. Our results indicate that PEN3 and other defense  proteins continuously cycle through the TGN and that timely exit of these  proteins from the TGN is critical for effective pre-invasive immune responses  against powdery mildews.', '2017 Jun 5', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2017.04.003', 'Somerville']
