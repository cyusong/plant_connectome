The orientation of cell division is a major determinant of plant morphogenesis. In spite of considerable efforts over the past decades, the precise mechanism of division plane selection remains elusive. The majority of studies on the topic have addressed division orientation from either a predominantly developmental or a cell biological perspective. Thus, mechanistic insights into the links between developmental and cellular factors affecting division orientation are particularly lacking. Here, I review recent progress in the understanding of cell division orientation in the embryo and primary root meristem of Arabidopsis from both developmental and cell biological standpoints. I offer a view of multilevel polarity as a central aspect of cell division: on the one hand, the division plane is a readout of tissue- and organism-wide polarities; on the other hand, the cortical division zone can be seen as a transient polar subcellular plasma membrane domain. Finally, I argue that a polarity-focused conceptual framework and the integration of developmental and cell biological approaches hold great promise to unravel the mechanistic basis of plant cell division orientation in the near future.
