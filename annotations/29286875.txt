The body shape of plants varied in proportion to the logarithm of the magnitude of gravity in the range from microgravity to hypergravity to resist the gravitational force. Here we discuss the roles of cortical microtubule and 65 kDa microtubule-associated protein-1 (MAP65-1) in gravity-induced modification of growth anisotropy. Microgravity stimulated elongation growth and suppressed lateral expansion in shoot organs, such as hypocotyls and epicotyls. On the other hand, hypergravity inhibited elongation growth and promoted lateral expansion in shoot organs. The number of cells with transverse microtubules was increased by microgravity, but decreased by hypergravity. Furthermore, the levels of MAP65-1, which is involved in the maintenance of the transverse microtubule orientation, were increased by microgravity, but decreased by hypergravity. Therefore, the regulation of orientation of cortical microtubules via changes in the levels of MAP65-1 may contribute to the modification of the body shape of plants to resist the gravitational force.
