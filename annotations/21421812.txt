['21421812', 'Arabidopsis thaliana APO1 is required for the accumulation of the chloroplast  photosystem I and NADH dehydrogenase complexes and had been proposed to  facilitate the incorporation of [4Fe-4S] clusters into these complexes. The  identification of maize (Zea mays) APO1 in coimmunoprecipitates with a protein  involved in chloroplast RNA splicing prompted us to investigate a role for APO1  in splicing. We show here that APO1 promotes the splicing of several chloroplast  group II introns: in Arabidopsis apo1 mutants, ycf3-intron 2 remains completely  unspliced, petD intron splicing is strongly reduced, and the splicing of several  other introns is compromised. These splicing defects can account for the loss of  photosynthetic complexes in apo1 mutants. Recombinant APO1 from both maize and  Arabidopsis binds RNA with high affinity in vitro, demonstrating that DUF794, the  domain of unknown function that makes up almost the entirety of APO1, is an RNA  binding domain. We provide evidence that DUF794 harbors two motifs that resemble  zinc fingers, that these bind zinc, and that they are essential for APO1  function. DUF794 is found in a plant-specific protein family whose members are  all predicted to localize to mitochondria or chloroplasts. Thus, DUF794 adds a  new example to the repertoire of plant-specific RNA binding domains that emerged  as a product of nuclear-organellar coevolution.', '2011 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.084335', 'Barkan']
