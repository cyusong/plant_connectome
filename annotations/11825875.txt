['11825875', 'Sexual reproduction in plants requires elongation of the pollen tube through the  transmitting tissues toward the ovary. Tube growth rate is a major determinant of  pollen competitive ability. We report that a K(+) channel of the Shaker family in  Arabidopsis, SPIK, plays an important role in pollen tube development. SPIK was  found to be specifically expressed in pollen. When SPIK was heterologously  expressed in COS cells, its product formed hyperpolarization-activated K(+)  channels. Disruption (T-DNA insertion) of the SPIK coding sequence strongly  affected inwardly rectifying K(+)-channel activity in the pollen-grain plasma  membrane. Measurements of membrane potential in growing pollen tubes yielded data  compatible with a contribution of SPIK to K(+) influx. In vitro pollen  germination assays were performed, revealing that the disruption results in  impaired pollen tube growth. Analysis of the transmission rate of the disrupted  allele in the progeny of heterozygous plants revealed a decrease in pollen  competitive ability, the probability of fertilization by mutant pollen being  approximately 1.6 times lower than that by wild-type pollen. The whole set of  data supports the hypothesis that functional expression of SPIK plays a role in  K(+) uptake in the growing pollen tube, and thereby in tube development and  pollen competitive ability.', '2002 Feb 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.213902', 'Sentenac']
