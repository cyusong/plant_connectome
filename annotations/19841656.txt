Harpins are type three secretion system (TTSS) effectors. While few harpins are thought to be translocators of TTSS effectors through the host plasma membrane during plant/bacteria interactions, functions of many harpins remain for the moment mysterious. We recently showed that the HrpW(ea) harpin from Erwinia amylovora, at subnamolar concentration, was able to decrease defense responses triggered by another harpin from this bacteria, HrpN(ea). This antagonism could be the result of opposed anion channels modulations triggered by HrpW(ea) and HrpN(ea). At upper concentrations HrpW(ea) alone, or in combination with HrpN(ea), was able to induce cell death. This form of cell death involves strong ion channel activation and shares similarity with apoptosis volume decrease (AVD), a form of programmed cell death well described in animal cells. All these results suggest different ways for harpins to trigger cell death and highlight the role of ion channels during cell death processes.

HrpW(ea): !decreases! defense responses
HrpW(ea): !induces! cell death
HrpN(ea): !triggers! modulations
HrpN(ea): !combined with! HrpW(ea) induces cell death
Ion channels: !involved in! cell death processes
