The plant mitochondrial respiratory system changes in its activity in response to light. This response has been thought to be important for ensuring cooperative function with the photosynthetic system. A recent study addressing light responses of the respiratory chain in Arabidopsis thaliana provided further insight into the role of mitochondria in illuminated leaves. Notably, the non-phosphorylating alternative oxidase is rapidly induced when plants are exposed to the high light stress, and appears to play a key role in keeping cellular redox balance.
