Monitoring expression at the transcriptional level is an essential first step for the functional analysis of plant genes. Genes encoding proteins directly involved in sulphur metabolism constitute only a small fraction of all the genes affected by sulphur deficiency stress. Transcriptional responses to various periods of sulphur deprivation have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, no corresponding data are available for Solanaceae sp. To address this problem, a subtractive library-based approach to search for tobacco genes regulated by a short-term sulphur starvation has been adopted. In this work, 38 genes were identified, of which 22 were regulated positively and 16 were regulated negatively. The transcript levels of the representative genes were monitored in four parts of the plants (mature and immature leaves, stems, and roots), which exhibited differential sulphur deficiency. Interestingly, some genes exhibit different regulation of expression in different parts of the plants. Database analysis allowed assignment of the potential function for many of the identified genes; however, the functions of a small number of genes strongly regulated by sulphur starvation remain unknown. The genes were grouped into nine functional categories, each including both up- and down-regulated genes. The possible links between the identified regulated genes and sulphur metabolism are considered, and compared where possible with expression patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana. Although no obvious regulatory genes were identified, the genes encoding proteins of unknown function remain as potential components of the regulatory processes.
