Two layers of plant immune systems are used by plants to defend against phytopathogens. The first layer is pathogen-associate molecular patterns (PAMPs)-triggered immunity (PTI), which is activated by plant cell-surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) upon perception of microbe general elicitors. The second layer is effector-triggered immunity (ETI), which is initiated by specific recognition of pathogen type III secreted effectors (T3SEs) with plant intracellular resistance (R) proteins. Current opinions agree that ETI was evolved from PTI, and the impetus for the evolution of plant immunity is pathogen T3SEs, which exhibit virulence functions through blocking PTI, but show avirulence functions for triggering ETI. A Decoy Model was put forward and explained that the avirulence targets of pathogen T3SEs were evolved as decoys to compete with the virulence targets for binding with pathogen T3SEs. However, little direct evidence for the evolutionary mode has been offered. Here, we reviewed the recent progresses about Pto, PBS1, and RIN4 to present our viewpoints about the evolution of plant immunity.
