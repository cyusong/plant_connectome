Since whole-genome sequencing of many crops has been achieved, crop functional genomics studies have stepped into the big-data and high-throughput era. However, acquisition of large-scale phenotypic data has become one of the major bottlenecks hindering crop breeding and functional genomics studies. Nevertheless, recent technological advances provide us potential solutions to relieve this bottleneck and to explore advanced methods for large-scale phenotyping data acquisition and processing in the coming years. In this article, we review the major progress on high-throughput phenotyping in controlled environments and field conditions as well as its use for post-harvest yield and quality assessment in the past decades. We then discuss the latest multi-omics research combining high-throughput phenotyping with genetic studies. Finally, we propose some conceptual challenges and provide our perspectives on how to bridge the phenotype-genotype gap. It is no doubt that accurate high-throughput phenotyping will accelerate plant genetic improvements and promote the next green revolution in crop breeding.
