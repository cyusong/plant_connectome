['17909855', 'Sitosterol and stigmasterol are major sterols in vascular plants. An altered  stigmasterol:sitosterol ratio has been proposed to influence the properties of  cell membranes, particularly in relation to various stresses, but biosynthesis of  stigmasterol is poorly understood. Recently, however, Morikawa et al. (Plant Cell  18:1008-1022, 2006) showed in Arabidopsis thaliana that synthesis of stigmasterol  and brassicasterol is catalyzed by two separate sterol C-22 desaturases, encoded  by the genes CYP710A1 and CYP710A2, respectively. The proteins belong to a small  cytochrome P450 subfamily having four members, denoted by CYP710A1-A4, and are  related to the yeast sterol C-22 desaturase Erg5p acting in ergosterol synthesis.  Here, we report on our parallel investigation of the Arabidopsis CYP710A family.  To elucidate the function of CYP710A proteins, transgenic Arabidopsis plants were  generated overexpressing CYP710A1 and CYP710A4. Compared to wild-type plants,  both types of transformant displayed a normal phenotype, but contained increased  levels of free stigmasterol and a concomitant decrease in the level of free  sitosterol. CYP710A1 transformants also displayed higher levels of esterified  forms of stigmasterol, cholesterol, 24-methylcholesterol and isofucosterol. The  results confirm the findings of Morikawa et al. (Plant Cell 18:1008-1022, 2006)  regarding the function of CYP710A1 in stigmasterol synthesis, and show that  CYP710A4 also has this capacity. Furthermore, our results suggest that an  increased stigmasterol level alone is sufficient to stimulate esterification of  other major sterols.', '2008 Jan', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-007-0618-8', 'Sitbon']
