The Gram-negative bacterium <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i>, the causal agent of bacterial wilt, is a worldwide major crop pathogen whose virulence strongly relies on a type III secretion system (T3SS). This extracellular apparatus allows the translocation of proteins, called type III effectors (T3Es), directly into the host cells. To date, very few data are available in plant-pathogenic bacteria concerning the role played by type III secretion (T3S) regulators at the posttranslational level. We have demonstrated that HpaP, a putative T3S substrate specificity switch protein of <i>R. solanacearum</i>, controls T3E secretion. To better understand the role of HpaP on T3S control, we analyzed the secretomes of the GMI1000 wild-type strain as well as the <i>hpaP</i> mutant using a mass spectrometry experiment (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry). The secretomes of both strains appeared to be very similar and highlighted the modulation of the secretion of few type III substrates. Interestingly, only one type III-associated protein, HrpJ, was identified as specifically secreted by the <i>hpaP</i> mutant. HrpJ appeared to be an essential component of the T3SS, essential for T3S and pathogenicity. We further showed that HrpJ is specifically translocated in planta by the <i>hpaP</i> mutant and that HrpJ can physically interact with HpaP. Moreover, confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated a cytoplasmic localization for HrpJ once in planta. When injected into <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> leaves, HrpJ is able to trigger a necrosis on 16 natural accessions. A genome-wide association mapping revealed a major association peak with 12 highly significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms located on a plant acyl-transferase.
