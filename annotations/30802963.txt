Appropriate regulation of crop seed germination is of significance for agriculture production. In this study, we show that TaJAZ1, most closely related to Arabidopsis JAZ3, negatively modulates abscisic acid (ABA)-inhibited seed germination and ABA-responsive gene expression in bread wheat. Biochemical interaction assays demonstrate that the C-terminal part containing the Jas domain of TaJAZ1 physically interacts with TaABI5. Similarly, Arabidopsis jasmonate-ZIM domain (JAZ) proteins also negatively modulate ABA responses. Further we find that a subset of JAZ proteins could interact with ABI5 using the luciferase complementation imaging assays. Choosing JAZ3 as a representative, we demonstrate that JAZ3 interacts with ABI5 in vivo and represses the transcriptional activation activity of ABI5. ABA application could abolish the enrichment of JAZ proteins in the ABA-responsive gene promoter. Furthermore, we find that ABA application could induce the expression of jasmonate (JA) biosynthetic genes and then increase the JA concentrations partially dependent on the function of ABI5, consequently leading to the degradation of JAZ proteins. This study sheds new light on the crosstalk between JA and ABA in modulating seed germination in bread wheat and Arabidopsis.
