We investigated what gene(s) in the plant roots have the positive role against repressing root-knot nematode (RKN) infection. We investigated the interaction between RKN infection and gene expression in the plant roots induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). We focused on the induced resistance response and the duration after foliar treatment with MeJA of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0mM at 1, 24, 48, and 72h prior to the inoculation of RKN. As a result, the foliar treatment with MeJA at 0.5mM or higher concentrations significantly reduced the infection of RKN in plants and the effect lasted for about 1 week. The repressing effect on RKN population declined to the lowest level in two weeks after MeJA treatment. The expression of proteinase inhibitors (PIs) and multicystatin (MC) were induced while the repressing effect on RKN was valid and a negative correlation was found between the expression of PIs or MC and RKN infection. In addition, when tomato plants no longer expressing MC and PIs were treated again with MeJA, the repressing effect revived. These phenomena appeared to be regardless of the existence of Mi-genes or isolate of RKN. Our results indicate that the expression level of MC and PIs may be effective as marker genes for estimating the induced resistance response against RKN infection.
