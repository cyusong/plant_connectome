['9512416', 'BACKGROUND: All organisms perceive and respond to a profusion of environmental  and endogenous signals that influence growth, development and behavior. The  G-protein signalling pathway is a highly conserved mechanism for transducing  extracellular signals, and the superfamily of receptors that have seven  transmembrane (7TM) domains is a primary element of this pathway. Evidence that  heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in signal transduction in plants is  accumulating, prompting speculation that plant 7TM receptors might exist.  RESULTS: Using information in the dbEST database of expressed sequence tags, we  isolated an Arabidopsis thaliana gene (GCR1) that encodes a protein with seven  predicted membrane-spanning domains and other features characteristic of 7TM  receptors. The protein shows 18-23% amino-acid identity (46-53% similarity) to,  and good colinear alignment with, 7TM receptors from three different families.  Its highest sequence identity is with the Dictyostelium cAMP receptors. GCR1 is  expressed at very low levels in the roots, stems and leaves of Arabidopsis; it is  a single-copy gene which maps close to the restriction fragment length  polymorphism marker m291 on chromosome 5. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing  antisense GCR1 under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S  promoter have reduced sensitivity to cytokinins in roots and shoots, yet respond  normally to all other plant hormones. This suggests a functional role for GCR1 in  cytokinin signal transduction. CONCLUSIONS: GCR1 encodes the first 7TM receptor  homologue identified in higher plants and is involved in cytokinin signal  transduction. This discovery suggests that 7TM receptors are ancient and predate  the divergence of plants and animals.', '1998 Mar 12', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70131-9', 'Hooley']
