Circadian clocks enable organisms to adapt to a 24 h diurnal cycle and anticipate rhythmic changes in the environment. The Arabidopsis central oscillator contains three genes encoding core clock components. CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1)/LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) reciprocally repress genes encoding each other and are critical for the generation of circadian rhythms controlling many clock outputs. A precise regulation of transcriptional events is, therefore, essential for proper circadian function. Here, we investigated histone 3 (H3) tail modifications of CCA1, LHY and TOC1 under various conditions. We found specific association of only H3K4Me3 and H3K9/14Ac with the translational start site of these three genes. These H3 marks were enriched at circadian time points of their increased transcription at different photoperiods and under free-running conditions, suggesting circadian regulation of H3 modifications. Analysis of clock-compromised CCA1-overexpressing lines provided evidence that light/dark photoperiods signal the establishment of these chromatin changes which are gated by the clock.

Light/dark photoperiods: !signal! establishment of chromatin changes
Clock-compromised CCA1-overexpressing lines: !provide evidence! that light/dark photoperiods signal the establishment of chromatin changes
