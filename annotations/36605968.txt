Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) are a large family of plant natural products with important pharmaceutical applications. <i>Sinomenium acutum</i> is a medicinal plant from the Menispermaceae family and has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis for hundreds of years. <i>Sinomenium acutum</i> contains more than 50 BIAs, and sinomenine is a representative BIA from this plant. Sinomenine was found to have preventive and curative effects on opioid dependence. Despite the broad applications of <i>S. acutum</i>, investigation on the biosynthetic pathways of BIAs from <i>S. acutum</i> is limited. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the transcriptome data and BIAs in the root, stem, leaf, and seed of <i>S. acutum</i>. Metabolic analysis showed a noticeable difference in BIA contents in different tissues. Based on the study of the full-length transcriptome, differentially expressed genes, and weighted gene co-expression network, we proposed the biosynthetic pathways for a few BIAs from <i>S. acutum</i>, such as sinomenine, magnoflorine, and tetrahydropalmatine, and screened candidate genes involved in these biosynthesis processes. Notably, the reticuline epimerase (REPI/STORR), which converts (<i>S</i>)-reticuline to (<i>R</i>)-reticuline and plays an essential role in morphine and codeine biosynthesis, was not found in the transcriptome data of <i>S. acutum</i>. Our results shed light on the biogenesis of the BIAs in <i>S. acutum</i> and may pave the way for the future development of this important medicinal plant.
