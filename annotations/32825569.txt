['32825569', 'E3 ubiquitin ligase plays a vital role in the ubiquitin-mediated heat-related  protein degradation pathway. Herein, we report that the expression of AtPPRT1, a  C3HC4 zinc-finger ubiquitin E3 ligase gene, was induced by heat stress, and the  beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene driven by the AtPPRT1 promoter has shown increased  activity after basal and acquired thermotolerance. To further explore the  function of AtPPRT1 in heat stress response (HSR), we used the atpprt1 mutant and  AtPPRT1-overexpressing lines (OE2 and OE10) to expose in heat shock. In this  study, the atpprt1 mutant had a lower germination and survival rate than those of  Col-0 when suffered from the heat stress, whereas OEs enhanced basal and acquired  thermotolerance in Arabidopsis seedlings. When compared to Col-0 and OEs,  loss-of-function in AtPPRT1 resulted in lower chlorophyll retention and higher  content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after heat treatment. Moreover, the  transcript levels of AtPPRT1 and several heat-related genes (AtZAT12, AtHSP21 and  AtHSFA7a) were upregulated to greater extents in OEs and lower extents in atpprt1  compared to Col-0 after heat treated. Hence, we suggest that AtPPRT1 may act as a  positive role in regulating the high temperature by mediating the degradation of  unknown target proteins.', '2020 Aug 21', 'Plants (Basel)', '10.3390/plants9091074', 'Wang']
