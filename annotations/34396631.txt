The loss of function of exocyst subunit EXO70B1 leads to autoimmunity, which is dependent on TIR-NBS2 (TN2), a truncated intracellular nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor (NLR). However, how TN2 triggers plant immunity and whether typical NLRs are required in TN2-activated resistance remain unclear. Through the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system and knockout analysis, we found that the spontaneous cell death and enhanced resistance in exo70B1-3 were independent of the full-length NLR SOC3 and its closest homolog SOC3-LIKE 1 (SOC3-L1). Additionally, knocking out SOC3-L1 or TN2 did not suppress the chilling sensitivity conferred by chilling sensitive 1-2 (chs1-2). The ACTIVATED DISEASE RESISTANCE 1 (ADR1) family and the N REQUIREMENT GENE 1 (NRG1) family have evolved as helper NLRs for many typical NLRs. Through CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing methods, we discovered that the autoimmunity of exo70B1-3 fully relied on ADR1s, but not NRG1s, and ADR1s contributed to the upregulation of TN2 transcript levels in exo70B1-3. Furthermore, overexpression of TN2 also led to ADR1-dependent autoimmune responses. Taken together, our genetic analysis highlights that the truncated TNL protein TN2-triggered immune responses require ADR1s as helper NLRs to activate downstream signaling, revealing the importance and complexity of ADR1s in plant immunity regulation.
