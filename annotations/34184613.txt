Serine proteases are a class of versatile proteolytic enzymes. They are necessary for protein catabolism, intracellular amino acid turnover, and regulation of proteins involved in diverse molecular and cellular processes across taxa. In this study, bioinformatic analyses revealed a significantly large number of serine proteases in the halotolerant cyanobacterium <i>Halothece</i> sp. PCC7418 (hereafter referred to as <i>Halothece</i> 7418) compared to the model freshwater cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942 (hereafter referred to as <i>S. elongatus</i> 7942). The cyanobacterial serine proteases are likely derived from different linages since no conserved motifs were detected. The presence of highly diverse serine proteases in <i>Halothece</i> 7418 implicated an evolutionary-mediated modification of several proteases, which may play numerous physiological roles. We also examined the gene expression patterns of 34 serine protease encoding genes in <i>Halothece</i> 7418 exposed to salt stress. Our results revealed that several serine protease genes were drastically up-regulated under salt with high concentration but remained unchanged under salt with low concentration. All four <i>clp</i> genes (<i>H1996, H1997, H0950</i>, and <i>H3375</i>) and <i>H3553</i> gene (which encodes a putative HtrA protease) were significantly induced upon salt stress. These responses support the roles of the housekeeping pathways in both the degradation of damaged proteins induced by salt stress and regulation of proteins involved in the molecular recovery from salt stress. Since serine proteases share several biochemical features and physiological functions, the results from this study provide an insight into diversification of serine proteases in cyanobacteria. Further, these results will increase our understanding of several mechanisms at the subcellular level.
