Retrozymes are nonautonomous retrotransposons with hammerhead ribozymes in their long terminal repeats (LTRs). Retrozyme transcripts can be self-cleaved by the LTR ribozyme, circularized, and can undergo RNA-to-RNA replication. Here, we demonstrate that the <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> genome contains hundreds of retrozyme loci, of which nine represent full-length retrozymes. The LTR contains a promoter directing retrozyme transcription. Although retrozyme RNA is easily detected in plants, the LTR region is heavily methylated, pointing to its transcriptional silencing, which can be mediated by 24 nucleotide-long retrozyme-specific RNAs identified in <i>N. benthamiana</i>. A transcriptome analysis revealed that half of the retrozyme-specific RNAs in plant leaves have no exact matches to genomic retrozyme loci, containing up to 13% mismatches with the closest genomic sequences, and could arise as a result of many rounds of RNA-to-RNA replication leading to error accumulation. Using a cloned retrozyme copy, we show that retrozyme RNA is capable of replication and systemic transport in plants. The presented data suggest that retrozyme loci in the <i>N. benthamiana</i> genome are transcriptionally inactive, and that circular retrozyme RNA can persist in cells due to its RNA-to-RNA replication and be transported systemically, emphasizing functional and, possibly, evolutionary links of retrozymes to viroids-noncoding circular RNAs that infect plants.
