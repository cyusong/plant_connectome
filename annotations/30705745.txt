['30705745', "A feature of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in Arabidopsis thaliana  (Arabidopsis) is the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated gene  expression. The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary among Arabidopsis  ecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation is unknown.  What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on orbit reveal  about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of  ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a  previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1) as being ROS-associated. The OMG1 5'  flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly  observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon  wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an  apparent transcriptional regulator of MYB77 and GRX480, which are associated with  the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS  production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests  that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family,  a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and  subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that  members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS  pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for  ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation.", '2019 Feb', 'AoB Plants', '10.1093/aobpla/ply075', 'Paul']
