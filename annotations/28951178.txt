Deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z at gene bodies regulates transcription by modifying chromatin accessibility in plants. However, the role of H2A.Z enrichment at the promoter and enhancer regions is unclear, and how H2A.Z interacts with other mechanisms of chromatin modification to regulate gene expression remains obscure. Here, we mapped genome-wide H2A.Z, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, Pol II, and nucleosome occupancy in Arabidopsis inflorescence. We showed that H2A.Z preferentially associated with H3K4me3 at promoters, while it was found with H3K27me3 at enhancers, and that H2A.Z deposition negatively correlated with gene expression. In addition, we demonstrated that H2A.Z represses gene expression by establishing low gene accessibility at +1 nucleosome and maintaining high gene accessibility at -1 nucleosome. We further showed that the high measures of gene responsiveness correlate with the H2A.Z-associated closed +1 nucleosome structure. Moreover, we found that H2A.Z represses enhancer activity by promoting H3K27me3 and preventing H3K4me3 histone modifications. This study provides a framework for future studies of H2A.Z functions and opens up new aspects for decoding the interplay between chromatin modification and histone variants in transcriptional control.
