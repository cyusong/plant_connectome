Flower color variation is ubiquitous in many plant species, and several studies have been conducted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. There are two flower color variants (yellowish-white and fuchsia) in the Rheum palmatum complex, however, few studies have investigated this phenomenon. Here, we used transcriptome sequencing of the two color variants to shed light on the molecular and biochemical basis for these color morphs. Comparison of the two transcriptomes identified 9641 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs), including 6477 up-regulated and 3163 down-regulated genes. Functional analyses indicated that several DEGs were related to the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, and the expression profiles of these DEGs were coincident with the qRT-PCR validation results, indicating that expression levels of structural genes have a profound effect on the color variation in the R. palmatum complex. Our results suggested that the interaction of transcription factors (MYB, bHLH and WRKY) also regulated the anthocyanin biosynthesis in the R. palmatum complex. Estimation of selection pressures using the dN/dS ratio showed that 1106 pairs of orthologous genes have undergone positive selection. Of these positively selected genes, 21 were involved in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, indicating that they may encode the proteins for structural alteration and affect flower color in the R. palmatum complex.
