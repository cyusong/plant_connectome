Circumnutation, the helical movement of organs, has been observed in diverse species of land plants. Whether circumnutation arises purely from internal growth oscillations or as a response to exogenous forces such as gravity is a subject of active debate. By observing rice seedlings grown under microgravity at the International Space Station (ISS) and analyzing the agravitropic lazy1 mutant, Kobayashi et al. (2019) propose gravity as the causal force that regulates circumnutation of rice coleoptiles.
