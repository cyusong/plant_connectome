Plants can protect against damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation by accumulating UV-absorbing substances in the epidermis of the leaves. Sun and shade leaves of a free standing beech tree (Fagus sylvatica L.) were studied for the differences in UV-shielding of the epidermis by means of multi-colour fluorescence images taken with UV and blue excitation. The distribution of the fluorescence intensity was detected over intact leaves in the emission maxima in the blue at 440 nm (F440), in the green at 520 nm (F520), in the red at 690 nm (F690) and in the far red at 740 nm (F740). Images of the logarithmic ratio between F690 excited in the blue and the UV (log ((B)F690/(UV)F690)) were calculated representing the relative absorption of UV in the epidermis and thus the degree of UV-shielding. It was found that UV-shielding is stronger for sun leaves than for shade leaves and better for the upper (adaxial) leaf side than for the lower (abaxial) leaf side of both leaf types. Within one leaf the highest value for the ratio log ((B)F690/(UV)F690) and thus the highest UV-shielding was found at the leaf rim which in broad leaves contains young tissue.
