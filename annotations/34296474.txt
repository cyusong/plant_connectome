['34296474', 'Leaf senescence is a pivotal step in the last stage of the plant life cycle and  is influenced by various external and endogenous cues. A series of reports have  indicated the involvement of the WRKY transcription factors in regulating leaf  senescence, but the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways remain largely  unclear. Here we provide evidence demonstrating that WRKY71 acts as a positive  regulator of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis. WRKY71-1D, an overexpressor of  WRKY71, exhibited early leaf senescence, while wrky71-1, the WRKY71  loss-of-function mutant, displayed delayed leaf senescence. Accordingly, a set of  senescence-associated genes (SAGs) were substantially elevated in WRKY71-1D but  markedly decreased in wrky71-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated  that WRKY71 can bind directly to the promoters of SAG13 and SAG201. Transcriptome  analysis suggested that WRKY71 might mediate multiple cues to accelerate leaf  senescence, such as abiotic stresses, dark and ethylene. WRKY71 was ethylene  inducible, and treatment with the ethylene precursor  1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid enhanced leaf senescence in WRKY71-1D but  caused only a marginal delay in leaf senescence in wrky71-1. In vitro and in vivo  assays demonstrated that WRKY71 can directly regulate ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2  (EIN2) and ORESARA1 (ORE1), genes of the ethylene signaling pathway.  Consistently, leaf senescence of WRKY71-1D was obviously retarded in the ein2-5  and nac2-1 mutants. Moreover, WRKY71 was also proved to interact with ACS2  in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with AgNO(3) and aminoethoxyvinylglycine and  acs2-1 could greatly arrest the leaf senescence of WRKY71-1D. In conclusion, our  data revealed that WRKY71 mediates ethylene signaling and synthesis to hasten  leaf senescence in Arabidopsis.', '2021 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.15433', 'ORCID:']
