Expansins are cell wall proteins inducing cell wall loosening and participate in all plant growth and development processes which are associated with cell wall modifications. Here, TaEXPB23, a wheat expansin gene, was investigated and the tolerance to oxidative stress was strongly enhanced in over-expression tobacco plants. Our results revealed that over-expressing TaEXPB23 influenced the activity of antioxidant enzymes: in particular, the activity of the cell wall-bound peroxidase. The enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress and increased cell wall-bound peroxidase activity were partly inhibited by an anti-expansin antibody. The Arabidopsis expansin mutant atexpb2 showed reduced cell wall-bound peroxidase activity and decreased oxidative stress tolerance. In addition, atexpb2 exhibited lower chlorophyll contents and the germination rate compared to wild type (WT). Taken together, these results provided a new insight on the role of expansin proteins in plant stress tolerance by cell wall bound peroxidase.
