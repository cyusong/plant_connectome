['26012558', "Plants survive periods of unfavourable conditions with the help of sensory  mechanisms that respond to reactive oxygen species (ROS) as signalling molecules  in different cellular compartments. We have previously demonstrated that protein  phosphatase 2A (PP2A) impacts on organellar cross-talk and associated  pathogenesis responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. This was evidenced by drastically  enhanced pathogenesis responses and cell death in cat2 pp2a-b'gamma double mutants,  deficient in the main peroxisomal antioxidant enzyme CATALASE 2 and PP2A  regulatory subunit B'gamma (PP2A-B'gamma). In the present paper, we explored the impacts  of PP2A-B'gamma and a highly similar regulatory subunit PP2A-B'zeta in growth regulation  and light stress tolerance in Arabidopsis. PP2A-B'gamma and PP2A-B'zeta display high  promoter activities in rapidly growing tissues and are required for optimal  growth under favourable conditions. Upon acclimation to a combination of high  light, elevated temperature and reduced availability of water, however, pp2a-b'gammazeta  double mutants grow similarly to the wild type and show enhanced tolerance  against photo-oxidative stress. We conclude that by controlling ROS homeostasis  and signalling, PP2A-B'gamma and PP2A-B'zeta may direct acclimation strategies upon  environmental perturbations, hence acting as important determinants of defence  responses and light acclimation in plants.", '2015 Dec', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.12575', 'Kangasjarvi']
