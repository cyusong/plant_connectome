Ethylene-responsive factors (ERFs), composing the largest group of AP2/EREBP transcription factors, are involved in diverse functions and some of them have been identified in plants. However, even in model plants Arabidopsis and rice, most of the genes in this group are functionally unknown yet. Especially in rice, ERF genes involved in ethylene response have not been reported previously. Here, we report a novel member of ERF group in rice, OsERF1 (Ethylene Response Factor gene in Oryza sativa). OsERF1 expressed consistently in different organs of rice and could be up-regulated by ethylene, a plant hormone associated with stress response. Overexpression of OsERF1 in Arabidopsis up-regulated the expression of two known ethylene-responsive genes, PDF1.2 and b-chitinase, and also significantly affected the growth and development of transgenic Arabidopsis. These results suggest the involvement of OsERF1 in ethylene response.
