Seed yield, a major determinant for the commercial success of grain crops, critically depends on pollen viability, which is dramatically reduced by environmental stresses, such as drought, salinity, and extreme temperatures. Salinity, in particular, is a major problem for crop yield known to affect about 20% of all arable land and cause huge economic losses worldwide. Flowering plants are particularly sensitive to environmental stress during sexual reproduction, and even a short exposure to stressing conditions can severely hamper reproductive success, and thus reduce crop yield. Since proline is required for pollen fertility and accumulates in plant tissues in response to different abiotic stresses, a role of proline in pollen protection under salt stress conditions can be envisaged. In this perspective, we analyze old and new data to evaluate the importance of pollen development under saline conditions, and discuss the possibility of raising proline levels in pollen grains as a biotechnological strategy to stabilize seed yield in the presence of salt stress. The overall data confirm that proline is necessary to preserve pollen fertility and limit seed loss under stressful conditions. However, at present, we have not enough data to conclude whether or not raising proline over wildtype levels in pollen grains can effectively ameliorate seed yield under saline conditions, and further work is still required.
