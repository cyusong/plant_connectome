Rice (Oryza sativa) plants have porous or hollow organs consisting of aerenchyma, which is presumed to function as a low-resistance diffusion pathway for air to travel from the foliage above the water to submerged organs. However, gas movement in rice plants has yet to be visualized in real time. In this study involving partially submerged rice plants, the leaves emerging from the water were fed nitrogen-13-labeled nitrogen ([<sup>13</sup> N]N<sub>2</sub> ) tracer gas, and the gas movement downward along the leaf blade, leaf sheath, and internode over time was monitored. The [<sup>13</sup> N]N<sub>2</sub> gas arrived at the bottom of the plant within 10 min, which was 20 min earlier than carbon-11 photoassimilates. The [<sup>13</sup> N]N<sub>2</sub> gas movement was presumably mediated by diffusion along the aerenchyma network from the leaf blade to the root via nodes functioning as junctions, which were detected by X-ray computed tomography. These findings imply the diffusion of gas along the aerenchyma, which does not consume energy, has enabled plants to adapt to aquatic environments. Additionally, there were no major differences in [<sup>13</sup> N]N<sub>2</sub> gas movement between paddy rice and deepwater rice plants, indicative of a common aeration mechanism in the two varieties, despite the difference in their response to flooding.
