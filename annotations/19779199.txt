['19779199', 'Metabolic plasticity, which largely relies on the creation of new genes, is an  essential feature of plant adaptation and speciation and has led to the evolution  of large gene families. A typical example is provided by the diversification of  the cytochrome P450 enzymes in plants. We describe here a retroposition,  neofunctionalization, and duplication sequence that, via selective and local  amino acid replacement, led to the evolution of a novel phenolic pathway in  Brassicaceae. This pathway involves a cascade of six successive hydroxylations by  two partially redundant cytochromes P450, leading to the formation of  N1,N5-di(hydroxyferuloyl)-N10-sinapoylspermidine, a major pollen constituent and  so-far-overlooked player in phenylpropanoid metabolism. This example shows how  positive Darwinian selection can favor structured clusters of nonsynonymous  substitutions that are needed for the transition of enzymes to new functions.', '2009 Sep 25', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1174095', 'Werck-Reichhart']
