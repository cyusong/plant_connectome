['18436742', 'Little is known about the way developmental cues affect how cells interpret their  environment. We characterized the transcriptional response to high salinity of  different cell layers and developmental stages of the Arabidopsis root and found  that transcriptional responses are highly constrained by developmental  parameters. These transcriptional changes lead to the differential regulation of  specific biological functions in subsets of cell layers, several of which  correspond to observable physiological changes. We showed that known stress  pathways primarily control semiubiquitous responses and used mutants that disrupt  epidermal patterning to reveal cell-layer-specific and inter-cell-layer effects.  By performing a similar analysis using iron deprivation, we identified common  cell-type-specific stress responses and revealed the crucial role the environment  plays in defining the transcriptional outcome of cell-fate decisions.', '2008 May 16', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1153795', 'Benfey']
