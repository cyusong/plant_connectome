The transcription factor NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) has been studied extensively for its multiple roles in root nodule symbiosis within plants of the nitrogen-fixing clade (NFC) that associate with soil bacteria, such as rhizobia and Frankia. However, NIN homologs are present in plants outside the NFC, suggesting a role in other developmental processes. Here, we show that the biofuel crop Populus sp., which is not part of the NFC, contains eight copies of NIN with diversified protein sequence and expression patterns. Lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) are produced by rhizobia and a wide range of fungi, including mycorrhizal ones, and act as symbiotic signals that promote lateral root formation. RNAseq analysis of Populus sp. treated with purified LCO showed induction of the PtNIN2 subfamily. Moreover, the expression of PtNIN2b correlated with the formation of lateral roots and was suppressed by cytokinin treatment. Constitutive expression of PtNIN2b overcame the inhibition of lateral root development by cytokinin under high nitrate conditions. Lateral root induction in response to LCOs likely represents an ancestral function of NIN retained and repurposed in nodulating plants, as we demonstrate that the role of NIN in LCO-induced root branching is conserved in both Populus sp. and legumes. We further established a visual marker of LCO perception in Populus sp. roots, the putative sulfotransferase PtSS1 that can be used to study symbiotic interactions with the bacterial and fungal symbionts of Populus sp.
