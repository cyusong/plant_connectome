Predawn plant water potential (Psi(w)) is used to estimate soil moisture available to plants because plants are expected to equilibrate with the root-zone Psi(w). Although this equilibrium assumption provides the basis for interpreting many physiological and ecological parameters, much work suggests predawn plant Psi(w) is often more negative than root-zone soil Psi(w). For many halophytes even when soils are well-watered and night-time shoot and root water loss eliminated, predawn disequilibrium (PDD) between leaf and soil Psi(w) can exceed 0.5 MPa. A model halophyte, Sarcobatus vermiculatus, was used to test the predictions that low predawn solute potential (Psi(s)) in the leaf apoplast is a major mechanism driving PDD and that low Psi(s) is due to high Na+ and K+ concentrations in the leaf apoplast. Measurements of leaf cell turgor (Psi(p)) and solute potential (Psi(s)) of plants grown under a range of soil salinities demonstrated that predawn symplast Psi(w) was 1.7 to 2.1 MPa more negative than predawn xylem Psi(w), indicating a significant negative apoplastic Psi(s). Measurements on isolated apoplastic fluid indicated that Na+ concentrations in the leaf apoplast ranged from 80 to 230 mM, depending on salinity, while apoplastic K+ remained around 50 mM. The water relations measurements suggest that without a low apoplastic Psi(s), predawn Psi(p) may reach pressures that could cause cell damage. It is proposed that low predawn apoplastic Psi(s) may be an efficient way to regulate Psi(p) in plants that accumulate high concentrations of osmotica or when plants are subject to fluctuating patterns of soil water availability.
