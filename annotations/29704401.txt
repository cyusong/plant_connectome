It has been reported in several pathosystems that disease resistance can vary in leaves at different stages. However, how general this leaf stage-associated resistance is, and the molecular mechanism(s) underlying it, remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of leaf stage on basal resistance, effector-triggered immunity (ETI) and nonhost resistance, using eight pathosystems involving the hosts Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum, and N. benthamiana and the pathogens Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000, and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). We show evidence that leaf stage-associated resistance exists ubiquitously in plants, but with varying intensity at different stages in diverse pathosystems. Microarray expression profiling assays demonstrated that hundreds of genes involved in defense responses, phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling, and calcium signaling, were differentially expressed between leaves at different stages. The Arabidopsis mutants sid1, sid2-3, ein2, jar1-1, aba1 and aao3 lost leaf stage-associated resistance to S. sclerotiorum, and the mutants aba1 and sid2-3 were affected in leaf stage-associated RPS2/AvrRpt2<sup>+</sup> -conferred ETI, whereas only the mutant sid2-3 influenced leaf stage-associated nonhost resistance to Xoo. Our results reveal that the phytohormones salicylic acid, ethylene, jasmonic acid and abscisic acid likely play an essential, but pathosystem-dependent, role in leaf stage-associated resistance.
