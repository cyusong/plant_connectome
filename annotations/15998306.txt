['15998306', 'The proper organization of cortical microtubule arrays is essential for  anisotropic growth in plants but how distinct array patterns are formed is not  understood. Here, we report a relationship between microtubule dynamics and array  organization using transgenic plants expressing modified tubulins. When green  fluorescent protein (GFP) or a hemaglutinin epitope tag was fused to the  N-terminus of tubulins and expressed in Arabidopsis plants, these tubulins were  incorporated into microtubules along with endogenous tubulins. Plants expressing  the modified beta-tubulins were phenotypically normal and possessed transversely  oriented cortical arrays in the epidermal cells of the root elongation zone;  however, the expression of modified alpha-tubulins caused right-handed helical  growth, increased trichome branching, and a shallow left-handed (S-form) helical  array organization. In cells expressing the modified alpha-tubulins, microtubule  dynamicity was suppressed and polymerization was promoted, and GFP-EB1 (End  Binding 1) labeled larger regions of the microtubule end more frequently, when  compared with control cells. We propose that the N-terminal appendage introduced  into alpha-tubulin inhibits GTP hydrolysis, thus producing polymerization-prone  microtubules with an extended GTP cap. Consistent with this interpretation,  plants expressing an alpha-tubulin mutated in the GTPase-activating domain  exhibited similar microtubule properties, with regard to dynamics and the  localization of GFP-EB1, and showed right-handed helical growth.', '2005 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02442.x', 'Hashimoto']
