Cuticle secreted on the surface of the epidermis of aerial organs protects plants from the external environment. We recently found that Arabidopsis MIXTA-like R2R3-MYB family members MYB16 and MYB106 regulate cuticle formation in reproductive organs and trichomes. However, the artificial miRNA (amiRNA)-mediated knockdown plants showed no clear phenotypic abnormality in vegetative tissues. In this study, we used RNA interference (RNAi) targeting MYB16 to produce plants with reduced expression of both MYB16 and MYB106. The rosette leaves of RNAi plants showed more severe permeable cuticle phenotypes than the myb106 mutants expressing the MYB16 amiRNA in the previous study. The RNAi plants also showed reduced expression of cuticle biosynthesis genes LACERATA and ECERIFERUM1. By contrast, expression of a gain-of-function MYB16 construct induced over-accumulation of waxy substances on leaves. These results suggest that MYB16 functions as a major regulator of cuticle formation in vegetative organs, in addition to its effect in reproductive organs and trichomes.
