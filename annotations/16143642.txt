A theory of fruit climacteric ethylene emission was developed and used as the basis of a simulation model called ETHY. According to the theory, the biosynthetic pathway of ethylene is supplied by ATP and is regulated by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase and ACC oxidase. The conjugation of ACC with malonate to form MACC was taken into account as a way to decrease the availability of ACC. Because of the seasonal increase of fruit volume, the dilution of biochemical compounds used in ETHY was taken into account. Finally, the ethylene diffusion across the skin was considered. The theory took into account the effect of temperature and O(2) and CO(2) internal concentrations on ethylene. The model was applied to peach (Prunus persica) fruit over 3 years, several leaf:fruit ratios, and irrigation conditions. An adequate ethylene increase was predicted without considering any increase in respiration during the ripening period, which suggests that the respiratory climacteric may not be required for ripening. Another important result of this study is the high sensitivity of ETHY to the parameters involved in the calculation of ACC oxidase and ACC synthase activities, ATP production, and skin surface and permeability. ETHY was also highly sensitive to changes in fruit growth and temperature.
