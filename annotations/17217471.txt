['17217471', 'Phosphomannomutase (PMM) catalyzes the interconversion of mannose-6-phosphate and  mannose-1-phosphate. However, systematic molecular and functional investigations  on PMM from higher plants have hitherto not been reported. In this work, PMM  cDNAs were isolated from Arabidopsis, Nicotiana benthamiana, soybean, tomato,  rice and wheat. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that plant PMM proteins  exhibited significant identity to their fungal and mammalian orthologs. In line  with the similarity in primary structure, plant PMM complemented the sec53-6  temperature sensitive mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Histidine-tagged  Arabidopsis PMM (AtPMM) purified from Escherichia coli converted  mannose-1-phosphate into mannose-6-phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate into  glucose-6-phosphate, with the former reaction being more efficient than the  latter one. In Arabidopsis and N. benthamiana, PMM was constitutively expressed  in both vegetative and reproductive organs. Reducing the PMM expression level  through virus-induced gene silencing caused a substantial decrease in ascorbic  acid (AsA) content in N. benthamiana leaves. Conversely, raising the PMM  expression level in N. benthamiana using viral-vector-mediated ectopic expression  led to a 20-50% increase in AsA content. Consistent with this finding, transgenic  expression of an AtPMM-GFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis also increased AsA  content by 25-33%. Collectively, this study improves our understanding on the  molecular and functional properties of plant PMM and provides genetic evidence on  the involvement of PMM in the biosynthesis of AsA in Arabidopsis and N.  benthamiana plants.', '2007 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02967.x', 'Wang']
