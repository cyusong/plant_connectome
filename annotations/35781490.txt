Chloroplast movements are controlled by ultraviolet/blue light through phototropins. In Arabidopsis thaliana, chloroplast accumulation at low light intensities and chloroplast avoidance at high light intensities are observed. These responses are controlled by two homologous photoreceptors, the phototropins phot1 and phot2. Whereas chloroplast accumulation is triggered by both phototropins in a partially redundant manner, sustained chloroplast avoidance is elicited only by phot2. Phot1 is able to trigger only a small, transient chloroplast avoidance, followed by the accumulation phase. The source of this functional difference is not fully understood at either the photoreceptor or the signalling pathway levels. In this article, we review current understanding of phototropin functioning and try to dissect the differences that result in signalling to elicit two distinct chloroplast responses. First, we focus on phototropin structure and photochemical and biochemical activity. Next, we analyse phototropin expression and localization patterns. We also summarize known photoreceptor systems controlling chloroplast movements. Finally, we focus on the role of environmental stimuli in controlling phototropin activity. All these aspects impact the signalling to trigger chloroplast movements and raise outstanding questions about the mechanism involved.

phot1: !triggers! transient chloroplast avoidance
phot2: !triggers! sustained chloroplast avoidance
phototropins: !control! chloroplast movements
environmental stimuli: !impact! phototropin activity
phot1/phot2: !partially redundantly! trigger chloroplast accumulation
