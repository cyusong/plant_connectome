Molecular chaperones and foldases are a diverse group of proteins that in vivo bind to misfolded or unfolded proteins (non-native or unstable proteins) and play important role in their proper folding. Stress conditions compel altered and heightened chaperone and foldase expression activity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which highlights the role of these proteins, due to which several of the proteins under these classes were identified as heat shock proteins. Different chaperones and foldases are active in different cellular compartment performing specific tasks. The review will discuss the role of the ER chaperones and foldases under stress conditions to maintain proper protein folding dynamics in the plant cells and recent advances in the field. The ER chaperones and foldases, which are described in article, are binding protein (BiP), glucose regulated protein (GRP94), protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPI), immunophilins, calnexin and calreticulin.

BiP: !binds to! misfolded proteins
GRP94: !expresses activity! under stress conditions
PDI: !performs! specific tasks
PPI: !localizes to! different cellular compartments
Immunophilins: !enhances! proper protein folding
Calnexin: !interacts with! ER chaperones
Calreticulin: !represses! non-native proteins
