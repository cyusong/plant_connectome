['17971043', 'The gravitropism defective 2 (grv2) mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana were  previously characterized as exhibiting shoot agravitropism resulting from  mutations in a homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans RECEPTOR-MEDIATED  ENDOCYTOSIS-8 (RME-8) gene, which is required in C. elegans for endocytosis. A  fluorescent protein fusion to the GRV2 protein localized to endosomes in  transgenic plants, and vacuolar morphology was altered in grv2 mutants. A defect  in vacuolar membrane dynamics provides a mechanistic explanation for the  gravitropic defect, and may also account for the presence of an enlarged vacuole  in early embryos, together with a nutrient requirement during seedling  establishment. The GRV2-positive endosomes were sensitive to Wortmannin but not  brefeldin A (BFA), consistent with GRV2 operating late in the endocytic pathway,  prior to delivery of vesicles to the central vacuole. The specific enlargement of  GRV2:YFP structures by Wortmannin, together with biochemical data showing that  GRV2 co-fractionates with pre-vacuolar markers such as PEP12/SYP21, leads us to  conclude that in plants GRV2/RME-8 functions in vesicle trafficking from the  multivesicular body/pre-vacuolar compartment to the lytic vacuole.', '2008 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03314.x', 'Somerville']
