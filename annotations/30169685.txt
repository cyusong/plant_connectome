Small regulatory RNAs guide gene silencing at the DNA or RNA level through repression of complementary sequences. The two main forms of small RNAs are microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNAs), which are generated from the processing of different forms of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors. These two forms of small regulatory RNAs function in distinct but overlapping gene silencing pathways in plants. Gene silencing pathways in eukaryotes evolved from an ancient prokaryotic mechanism involved in genome defense against invasive genetic elements, but has since diversified to also play a crucial role in regulation of endogenous gene expression. Here, we review the biogenesis of the different forms of small RNAs in plants, including miRNAs, phased, secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs) and heterochromatic siRNAs (hetsiRNAs), with a focus on their functions in genome defense, transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing, RNA-directed DNA methylation, trans-chromosomal methylation and paramutation. We also discuss the important role that gene duplication has played in the functional diversification of gene silencing pathways in plants, and we highlight recently discovered components of gene silencing pathways in plants.
