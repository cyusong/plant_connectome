['30902363', 'Phragmoplast-associated kinesin-related protein 2 (PAKRP2) is an orphan kinesin  in Arabidopsis thaliana that is thought to transport vesicles along phragmoplast  microtubules for cell plate formation. Here, using single-molecule fluorescence  microscopy, we show that PAKRP2 is the first orphan kinesin to exhibit processive  plus-end-directed motility on single microtubules as individual homodimers. Our  results show that PAKRP2 processivity is achieved despite having an exceptionally  long (32 residues) neck linker. Furthermore, using high-resolution nanoparticle  tracking, we find that PAKRP2 steps via a hand-over-hand mechanism that includes  frequent side steps, a prolonged diffusional search of the tethered head, and  tight coupling of the ATP hydrolysis cycle to the forward-stepping cycle.  Interestingly, truncating the PAKRP2 neck linker to 14 residues decreases the run  length of PAKRP2; thus, the long neck linker enhances the processive behavior.  Based on the canonical model of kinesin stepping, such a long neck linker is  expected to decrease the processivity and disrupt the coupling of ATP hydrolysis  to forward stepping. Therefore, we conclude that PAKRP2 employs a noncanonical  strategy for processive motility, wherein a long neck linker is coupled with a  slow ATP hydrolysis rate to allow for an extended diffusional search during each  step without sacrificing processivity or efficiency.', '2019 Apr 2', 'Biophys J', '10.1016/j.bpj.2019.02.019', 'Qiu']
