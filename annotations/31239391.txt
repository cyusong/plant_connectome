The transcription of 18S, 5.8S, and 18S rRNA genes (45S rDNA), cotranscriptional processing of pre-rRNA, and assembly of mature rRNA with ribosomal proteins are the linchpins of ribosome biogenesis. In yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) and animal cells, hundreds of pre-rRNA processing factors have been identified and their involvement in ribosome assembly determined. These studies, together with structural analyses, have yielded comprehensive models of the pre-40S and pre-60S ribosome subunits as well as the largest cotranscriptionally assembled preribosome particle: the 90S/small subunit processome. Here, we present the current knowledge of the functional organization of 45S rDNA, pre-rRNA transcription, rRNA processing activities, and ribosome assembly factors in plants, focusing on data from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Based on yeast and mammalian cell studies, we describe the ribonucleoprotein complexes and RNA-associated activities and discuss how they might specifically affect the production of 40S and 60S subunits. Finally, we review recent findings concerning pre-rRNA processing pathways and a novel mechanism involved in a ribosome stress response in plants.
