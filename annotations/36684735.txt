Saline stress is a significant factor that caused crop growth inhibition and yield decline. SHORT INTERNODES/STYLISH (SHI/STY) and SHI-RELATED SEQUENCE (SRS) transcription factors are specific to plants and share a conserved RING-like zinc-finger domain (CX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>7</sub>CX<sub>4</sub>CX<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub>C). However, the functions of <i>SHI</i>/<i>STY</i> and <i>SRS</i> genes in cotton responses to salt stress remain unclear. In this study, 26 <i>GhSRSs</i> were identified in <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>, which further divided into three subgroups. Phylogenetic analysis of 88 <i>SRSs</i> from8 plant species revealed independent evolutionary pattern in some of <i>SRSs</i> derived from monocots. Conserved domain and subcellular location predication of GhSRSs suggested all of them only contained the conserved RING-like zinc-finger domain (DUF702) domain and belonged to nucleus-localized transcription factors except for the GhSRS22. Furthermore, synteny analysis showed structural variation on chromosomes during the process of cotton polyploidization. Subsequently, expression patterns of <i>GhSRS</i> family members in response to salt and drought stress were analyzed in <i>G. hirsutum</i> and identified a salt stress-inducible gene <i>GhSRS21</i>. The GhSRS21 was proved to localize in the nuclear and silencing it in <i>G. hirsutum</i> increased the cotton resistance to salt using the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system. Finally, our transcriptomic data revealed that <i>GhSRS21</i> negatively controlled cotton salt tolerance by regulating the balance between ROS production and scavenging. These results will increase our understanding of the <i>SRS</i> gene family in cotton and provide the candidate resistant gene for cotton breeding.
