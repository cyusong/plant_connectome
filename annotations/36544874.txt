Plant effector biology is a research area that describes how plant-associated organisms modulate host structures and function to promote colonization by using small molecules (effectors). In this article, we analyzed 249 highly cited publications focused on plant pathogen effectors (<i>i.e.</i>, Highly Influential studies on plant Pathogen Effectors; thereafter HIPEs) published between 2000 and 2020. This analysis identifies countries, organizations, and journals that contributed HIPEs, and reveals the evolution of research trends, model molecules, and model organisms over the last two decades. We notably show an increasing proportion of studies focused on effectors of biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi upon time. Our snapshot of the highly influential plant effector biology papers may help new comers in the field to gain an analytical understanding of this research area.
