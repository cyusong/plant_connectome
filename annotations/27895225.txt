['27895225', 'Glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs) are a class of glycosylated  sphingolipids found in plants, fungi, and protozoa. These lipids are abundant in  the plant plasma membrane, forming  approximately 25% of total plasma membrane lipids. Little  is known about the function of the glycosylated headgroup, but two recent studies  have indicated that they play a key role in plant signaling and defense. Here, we  show that a member of glycosyltransferase family 64, previously named ECTOPICALLY  PARTING CELLS1, is likely a Golgi-localized GIPC-specific mannosyl-transferase,  which we renamed GIPC MANNOSYL-TRANSFERASE1 (GMT1). Sphingolipid analysis  revealed that the Arabidopsis thaliana gmt1 mutant almost completely lacks  mannose-carrying GIPCs. Heterologous expression of GMT1 in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cv Bright Yellow 2 resulted in the  production of non-native mannosylated GIPCs. gmt1 displays a severe dwarfed  phenotype and a constitutive hypersensitive response characterized by elevated  salicylic acid and hydrogen peroxide levels, similar to that we previously  reported for the Golgi-localized, GIPC-specific, GDP-Man transporter GONST1  (Mortimer et al., 2013). Unexpectedly, we show that gmt1 cell walls have a  reduction in cellulose content, although other matrix polysaccharides are  unchanged.', '2016 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00186', 'ORCID:']
