Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) serve to transmit information in eukaryotic cells. The involvement of this second messenger in plant cell growth as well as osmotic- and water relations is well established. After almost 40 years of intense research on the coding and decoding of plant Ca2+ signals, numerous proteins involved in Ca2+ action have been identified. However, we are still far from understanding the complexity of Ca2+ networks. New in vivo Ca2+ imaging techniques combined with molecular genetics allow visualisation of spatio-temporal aspects of Ca2+ signalling. In parallel, cell biology together with protein biochemistry and electrophysiology are able to dissect information processing by this second messenger in space and time. Here we focus on the time-resolved changes in cellular events upon Ca2+ signals, concentrating on the two best-studied cell types, pollen tubes and guard cells. We put their signalling networks side by side, compare them with those of other cell types and discuss rapid signalling in the context of Ca2+ transients and oscillations to regulate ion homeostasis.
