['27609839', 'Telomeres are the essential nucleoprotein structures that provide a physical cap  for the ends of linear chromosomes. The highly conserved CST (CTC1/STN1/TEN1)  protein complex facilitates telomeric DNA replication and promotes telomere  stability. Here we report three unexpected properties of Arabidopsis thaliana  TEN1 that indicate it possesses functions distinct from other previously  characterized telomere proteins. First, we show that telomeres in ten1 mutants  are highly sensitive to thermal stress. Heat shock causes abrupt and dramatic  loss of telomeric DNA in ten1 plants, likely via deletional recombination.  Second, we show that AtTEN1 has the properties of a heat-shock induced molecular  chaperone. At elevated temperature, AtTEN1 rapidly assembles into high molecular  weight homo-oligomeric complexes that efficiently suppress heat-induced  aggregation of model protein substrates in vitro. Finally, we report that AtTEN1  specifically protects CTC1 from heat-induced aggregation in vitro, and from  heat-induced protein degradation and loss of telomere association in vivo.  Collectively, these observations define Arabidopsis TEN1 as a highly dynamic  protein that works in concert with CTC1 to preserve telomere integrity in  response to environmental stress.', '2016 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00408', 'Shippen']
