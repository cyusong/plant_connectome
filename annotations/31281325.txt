['31281325', 'The SMC 5/6 complex together with cohesin and condensin is a member of the  structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) protein family. In non-plant organisms  SMC5/6 is engaged in DNA repair, meiotic synapsis, genome organization and  stability. In plants, the function of SMC5/6 is still enigmatic. Therefore, we  analyzed the crucial delta-kleisin component NSE4 of the SMC5/6 complex in the model  plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Two functional conserved Nse4 paralogs (Nse4A and  Nse4B) are present in A. thaliana, which may have evolved via gene  subfunctionalization. Due to its high expression level, Nse4A seems to be the  more essential gene, whereas Nse4B appears to be involved mainly in seed  development. The morphological characterization of A. thaliana T-DNA mutants  suggests that the NSE4 proteins are essential for plant growth and fertility.  Detailed investigations in wild-type and the mutants based on live cell imaging  of transgenic GFP lines, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),  immunolabeling and super-resolution microscopy suggest that NSE4A acts in several  processes during plant development, such as mitosis, meiosis and chromatin  organization of differentiated nuclei, and that NSE4A operates in a cell  cycle-dependent manner. Differential response of NSE4A and NSE4B mutants after  induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) suggests their involvement in DNA repair  processes.', '2019', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2019.00774', 'Schubert']
