Osmotic stress caused by drought, salt or cold decreases plant fitness. Acquired stress tolerance defines the ability of plants to withstand stress following an initial exposure<sup>1</sup>. We found previously that acquired osmotolerance after salt stress is widespread among Arabidopsis thaliana accessions<sup>2</sup>. Here, we identify ACQOS as the locus responsible for ACQUIRED OSMOTOLERANCE. Of its five haplotypes, only plants carrying group 1 ACQOS are impaired in acquired osmotolerance. ACQOS is identical to VICTR, encoding a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein<sup>3</sup>. In the absence of osmotic stress, group 1 ACQOS contributes to bacterial resistance. In its presence, ACQOS causes detrimental autoimmunity, thereby reducing osmotolerance. Analysis of natural variation at the ACQOS locus suggests that functional and non-functional ACQOS alleles are being maintained due to a trade-off between biotic and abiotic stress adaptation. Thus, polymorphism in certain plant NLR genes might be influenced by competing environmental stresses.
