Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the major storage form of seed oil in oilseed plants. They are biosynthesized de novo in seed plastids and then transported into the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the transport mechanism for plastid fatty acids in developing seeds remains unknown. Here, we isolated two novel plastid fatty acid exporters (FATTYACID EXPORT 2 [FAX2] and FAX4, respectively) specifically abundant in seed embryos during the seed-filling stage in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). FAX2 and FAX4 were both localized to the chloroplast membrane. <i>FAX2</i> and <i>FAX4</i> loss-of-function mutations caused deficiencies in embryo and cotyledon development. Seeds of <i>fax2fax4</i> double mutants exhibited significantly reduced TAG contents but elevated levels of plastid lipid contents compared with those of wild-type plants. By contrast, overexpression of <i>FAX2</i> or <i>FAX4</i> enhanced TAG deposition. Seed-feeding experiments showed that the two FAX proteins transported <sup>14</sup>C-plastid fatty acids and <sup>13</sup>C-oleic acids for TAG biosynthesis during the seed-filling stage. Together, our data demonstrate that FAX2 and FAX4 play critical roles in transporting plastid fatty acids for TAG biosynthesis during seed embryo development. These two transporters may have broad application for increasing oil yield in oilseed crops.
