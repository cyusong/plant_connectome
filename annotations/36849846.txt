The forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a well-characterized small protein module that mediates protein-protein interactions by targeting motifs containing phosphothreonine, is present in many regulatory molecules like protein kinase, phosphatases, transcription factors, and other functional proteins. FHA-domain containing proteins in yeast and human are involved in a large variety of cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, or pre-mRNA processing. Since the first FHA-domain protein, kinase-associated protein phosphatase (KAPP) was found in plants, the interest in plant FHA-containing proteins has increased dramatically, mainly due to the important role of FHA domain-containing proteins in plant growth and development. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental properties of FHA domain-containing proteins in plants, and systematically summarized and analyzed the research progress of proteins containing the FHA domain in plants. We also emphasized that AT5G47790 and its homologs may play an important role as the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in plants.
