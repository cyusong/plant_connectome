['10743659', 'Red chlorophyll catabolite (RCC) reductase (RCCR) and pheophorbide (Pheide) a  oxygenase (PaO) catalyse the key reaction of chlorophyll catabolism, porphyrin  macrocycle cleavage of Pheide a to a primary fluorescent catabolite (pFCC). RCCR  was purified from barley and a partial gene sequence was cloned (pHvRCCR). The  gene was expressed at all stages of leaf development and in roots. By comparison  with different databases, genomic sequences and expressed sequence tags similar  to RCCR were found in phylogenetically diverse species, and activity of RCCR was  demonstrated in two of them, Arabidopsis thaliana and Marchantia polymorpha. The  gene of A. thaliana (AtRCCR) was employed for molecular cloning, heterologous  expression and the production of polyclonal antibodies. With recombinant RCCR,  the major product of RCC reduction was pFCC-1, but small quantities of its C1  epimer, pFCC-2, also accumulated. The reaction required reduced ferredoxin and  was sensitive to oxygen. AtRCCR encoded a 35 kDa protein which was used for  chloroplast import experiments. Upon transport, it was processed to a mature form  of 31 kDa. The significance of cloning of RCCR is discussed in respect to the  evolution of chlorophyll catabolism and to the cloning of PaO.', '2000 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00667.x', 'Hortensteiner']
