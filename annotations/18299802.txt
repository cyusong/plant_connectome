['18299802', 'An Arabidopsis mutant with improved salt tolerant germination was isolated from a  T-DNA insertion library and designated as AT6. This mutant also exhibited  improved salt tolerance phenotype in later developmental stages. But no apparent  difference was observed in response to ABA, GA or ethylene during germination  between the mutant and the wildtype. The T-DNA was inserted in the At1g73660  locus that coded for a putative MAPKKK. Genetic and multiple mutant allele  analyses confirmed that the knockout of this gene resulted in improved salt  tolerance phenotype and provided strong evidence that the genetic locus At1g73660  negatively regulated salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. The At1g73660 was down  regulated in response to salt stress in the mutants, which is consistent with its  role as a negative regulator. It is therefore hypothesized that the AT1g73660 may  serve as one of the off-switches of stress responses that are required for  unstressed conditions.', '2008 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-008-9306-8', 'Xiang']
