<i>Peucedanum praeruptorum</i> Dunn is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine that is abundant in furano- and dihydropyrano coumarins. When <i>P. praeruptorum</i> reaches the bolting stage, the roots gradually lignified, and the content of coumarins declines rapidly. Non-bolting has always been a decisive factor for harvesting the <i>P. praeruptorum</i> materials. To evaluate the amount of coumarin components in unbolted and bolted <i>P. praeruptorum</i>, the variations of praeruptorin A, praeruptorin B, praeruptorin E, peucedanocoumarin I, and peucedanocoumarin II were determined. Additionally, 336,505 transcripts were obtained from the comparative transcriptome data. Among them, a total of 1,573 differentially expressed genes were screened out. To identify the critical genes involved in coumarin biosynthesis, comparative transcriptomics coupled with co-expression associated analysis was conducted. Finally, coumarin biosynthesis-related eighteen candidate genes were selected for the validation of <i>q</i>PCR. Additionally, a phylogenetic tree and the expression profile of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were constructed. To clarify the main genes in the regulation of coumarin biosynthesis, the interaction network of the co-expression genes from thirteen modules was constructed. Current results exhibited the significant increment of praeruptorin A, praeruptorin B and praeruptorin E in the bolted <i>P. praeruptorum</i>. Although, peucedanocoumarin I and peucedanocoumarin II were slightly increased. Besides the content of coumarins, the essential genes involved in the coumarin biosynthesis also exhibited an overall downward trend after bolting. Three <i>peroxidases</i> (<i>PRXs</i>) involved in the production of lignin monomers had been demonstrated to be downregulated. <i>PAL</i>, <i>C4H</i>, <i>HCT</i>, <i>COMT</i>, <i>CCoAOMT</i>, and some ABC transporters were dramatically downregulated at the bolting stage. These results indicated that the downregulation of coumarin biosynthetic genes in the bolted <i>P. praeruptorum</i> ultimately reduced the formation of coumarins. However, the mechanism through which bolting indirectly affects the formation of coumarin still needs extra functional verification.
