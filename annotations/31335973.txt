Trees allocate C from sources to sinks by way of a series of processes involving carbohydrate transport and utilization. Yet these dynamics are not well characterized in trees, and it is unclear how these dynamics will respond to a warmer world. Here, we conducted a warming and pulse-chase experiment on Eucalyptus parramattensis growing in a whole-tree chamber system to test whether warming impacts carbon allocation by increasing the speed of carbohydrate dynamics. We pulse-labelled large (6-m tall) trees with <sup>13</sup> C-CO<sub>2</sub> to follow recently fixed C through different organs by using compound-specific isotope analysis of sugars. We then compared concentrations and mean residence times of individual sugars between ambient and warmed (+3°C) treatments. Trees dynamically allocated <sup>13</sup> C-labelled sugars throughout the aboveground-belowground continuum. We did not, however, find a significant treatment effect on C dynamics, as sugar concentrations and mean residence times were not altered by warming. From the canopy to the root system, <sup>13</sup> C enrichment of sugars decreased, and mean residence times increased, reflecting dilution and mixing of recent photoassimilates with older reserves along the transport pathway. Our results suggest that a locally endemic eucalypt was seemingly able to adjust its physiology to warming representative of future temperature predictions for Australia.
