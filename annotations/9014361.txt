['9014361', 'The mechanisms by which higher plants recognize and respond to sugars are largely  unknown. Here, we present evidence that the first enzyme in the hexose  assimilation pathway, hexokinase (HXK), acts as a sensor for plant sugar  responses. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing antisense hexokinase (AtHXK)  genes are sugar hyposensitive, whereas plants overexpressing AtHXK are sugar  hypersensitive. The transgenic plants exhibited a wide spectrum of altered sugar  responses in seedling development and in gene activation and repression.  Furthermore, overexpressing the yeast sugar sensor YHXK2 caused a dominant  negative effect by elevating HXK catalytic activity but reducing sugar  sensitivity in transgenic plants. The result suggests that HXK is a dual-function  enzyme with a distinct regulatory function not interchangeable between plants and  yeast.', '1997 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.9.1.5', 'Sheen']
