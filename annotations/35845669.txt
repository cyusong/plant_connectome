<i>Synchytrium endobioticum</i>, the causal agent of potato wart disease, poses a major threat to commercial potato production. Understanding the roles of transcriptionally regulated genes following pathogen infection is necessary for understanding the system-level host response to pathogen. Although some understanding of defense mechanisms against <i>S. endobioticum</i> infection has been gained for incompatible interactions, the genes and signaling pathways involved in the compatible interaction remain unclear. Based on the collection of wart diseased tubers of a susceptible cultivar, we performed phenotypic and dual RNA-Seq analyses of wart lesions in seven stages of disease progression. We totally detected 5,052 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by comparing the different stages of infection to uninfected controls. The tendency toward differential gene expression was active rather than suppressed under attack by the pathogen. The number of DEGs step-up along with the development of the disease and the first, third and seventh of the disease stages showed substantially increase of DEGs in comparison of the previous stage. The important functional groups identified <i>via</i> Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment were those responsible for plant-pathogen interaction, fatty acid elongation and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Gene coexpression networks, composed of 17 distinct gene modules that contained between 25 and 813 genes, revealed high interconnectivity of the induced response and led to the identification of a number of hub genes enriched at different stages of infection. These results provide a comprehensive perspective on the global response of potato to <i>S. endobioticum</i> infection and identify a potential transcriptional regulatory network underlying this susceptible response, which contribute to a better understanding of the potato-<i>S. endobioticum</i> pathosystem.
