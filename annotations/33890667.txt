['33890667', 'Monounsaturated alkenes are present in the cuticular waxes of diverse plants and  are thought to play important roles in their interactions with abiotic and biotic  factors. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf wax has been reported to contain  alkenes; however, their biosynthesis has not been investigated to date. Here, we  found that these alkenes have mainly omega-7 and omega-9 double bonds in  characteristically long hydrocarbon chains ranging from C33 to C37. A screening  of desaturase-deficient mutants showed that a single desaturase belonging to the  acyl-CoA desaturase (ADS) family, previously reported as ADS4.2, was responsible  for introducing double bonds en route to the wax alkenes. ADS4.2 was highly  expressed in young leaves, especially in trichomes, where the alkenes are known  to accumulate. The enzyme showed strong activity on acyl substrates longer than  C32 and omega-7 product regio-specificity when expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae). Its endoplasmic reticulum localization further confirmed that ADS4.2  has access to very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA substrates. The upstream  biosynthesis pathways providing substrates to ADS4.2 and the downstream reactions  forming the alkene products in Arabidopsis were further clarified by alkene  analysis of mutants deficient in other wax biosynthesis genes. Overall, our  results show that Arabidopsis produces wax alkenes through a unique  elongation-desaturation pathway, which requires the participation of ADS4.2.', '2021 Aug 3', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiab182', 'ORCID:']
