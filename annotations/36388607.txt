Previous studies have indicated that some <i>Rehmannia glutinosa</i> Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinases (LRR-RLKs) are involved in the formation of replant disease. However, it remains unclear how the interaction of LRR-RLKs with a key factor, the interaction between root exudates and <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>, results in formation of replant disease. In this study, the influences of root exudates, <i>F. oxysporum</i> and the interaction of these two factors on expression of nine <i>R. glutinosa LRR-RLKs</i> (<i>RgLRRs</i>) were analyzed. The resulting eight <i>RgLRRs</i> of them were highly expressed at the early stage, and rapidly declined at later stages under mixed treatment of root exudates and <i>F. oxysporum</i>. The functions of nine <i>RgLRRs</i> under root exudates, <i>F. oxysporum</i> and mixed treatment of root exudates and <i>F. oxysporum</i> were preliminarily analyzed using transient overexpression and RNAi experiments. The results showed that high expression of <i>RgLRR19</i>, <i>RgLRR21</i>, <i>RgLRR23</i> and <i>RgLRR29</i> could decrease the damage to root cells from the mixed treatment of root exudates and <i>F. oxysporum</i>, but the interference of these genes enhanced the damage levels of root cells. Based on this, stable transgenic <i>R. glutinosa</i> seedlings were acquired. Overexpression of <i>RgLRR29</i> conferred resistance of <i>R. glutinosa</i> seedlings to root exudates, <i>F. oxysporum</i> and mixed treatment. These results indicated that the continuous proliferation of <i>F. oxysporum</i> supported by root exudates altered the expression patterns of <i>RgLRRs</i> in <i>R. glutinosa</i>, then disordered the growth and development of <i>R. glutinosa</i>, finally leading to the formation of replant disease.
