N<sup>6</sup>-methylated adenine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most frequent posttranscriptional modification in eukaryotic mRNA. Turnover of RNA generates N<sup>6</sup>-methylated AMP (N<sup>6</sup>-mAMP), which has an unclear metabolic fate. We show that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and human cells require an N<sup>6</sup>-mAMP deaminase (ADAL, renamed MAPDA) to catabolize N<sup>6</sup>-mAMP to inosine monophosphate in vivo by hydrolytically removing the aminomethyl group. A phylogenetic, structural, and biochemical analysis revealed that many fungi partially or fully lack MAPDA, which coincides with a minor role of N<sup>6</sup>A-RNA methylation in these organisms. MAPDA likely protects RNA from m<sup>6</sup>A misincorporation. This is required because eukaryotic RNA polymerase can use N<sup>6</sup>-mATP as a substrate. Upon abrogation of <i>MAPDA</i>, root growth is slightly reduced, and the N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine, N<sup>6</sup>-mAMP, and N<sup>6</sup>-mATP concentrations are increased in Arabidopsis. Although this will potentially lead to m<sup>6</sup>A misincorporation into RNA, we show that the frequency is too low to be reliably detected in vivo. Since N<sup>6</sup>-mAMP was severalfold more abundant than N<sup>6</sup>-mATP in <i>MAPDA</i> mutants, we speculate that additional molecular filters suppress the generation of N<sup>6</sup>-mATP. Enzyme kinetic data indicate that adenylate kinases represent such filters being highly selective for AMP versus N<sup>6</sup>-mAMP phosphorylation. We conclude that a multilayer molecular protection system is in place preventing N<sup>6</sup>-mAMP accumulation and salvage.
