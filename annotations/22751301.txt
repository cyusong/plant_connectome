X-ray and UVC are the two physical agents that damage DNA directly, with both agents capable of inducing double-strand breaks. Some of our recent work has demonstrated that local exposure to UVC results in a systemic increase in recombination frequency, suggesting that information about exposure can be passed from damaged to non-damaged tissue. Indeed, we recently showed that plants sharing the same enclosed environment with UVC-irradiated plants exhibit similar increase in homologous recombination frequency as irradiated plants. Here, we further tested whether yet another DNA-damaging agent, X-ray, is capable of increasing recombination rate (RR) in neighboring plants grown in a Petri dish. To test this, we grew plants exposed to X-ray or UVC irradiation in an enclosed environment next to non-exposed plants. We found that both X-ray and UVC-irradiated plants and neighboring plants exhibited comparable increases in the levels of strand breaks and the RR. We further showed that pre-exposure of plants to radical scavenger DMSO substantially alleviates the radiation-induced increase in RR and prevents formation of bystander signal. Our results suggest that the increase in RR in bystander plants can also be triggered by X-ray and that radicals may play some role in initiation or maintenance of this signal.
