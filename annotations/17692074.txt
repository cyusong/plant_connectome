Microbes detoxify arsenate by reduction and efflux of arsenite. Plants have a high capacity to reduce arsenate, but arsenic efflux has not been reported. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and rice (Oryza sativa) were grown hydroponically and supplied with 10 microm arsenate or arsenite, with or without phosphate, for 1-3 d. The chemical species of As in nutrient solutions, roots and xylem sap were monitored, roles of microbes and root exudates in As transformation were investigated and efflux of As species from tomato roots was determined. Arsenite remained stable in the nutrient solution, whereas arsenate was rapidly reduced to arsenite. Microbes and root exudates contributed little to the reduction of external arsenate. Arsenite was the predominant species in roots and xylem sap. Phosphate inhibited arsenate uptake and the appearance of arsenite in the nutrient solution, but the reduction was near complete in 24 h in both -P- and +P-treated tomato. Phosphate had a greater effect in rice than tomato. Efflux of both arsenite and arsenate was observed; the former was inhibited and the latter enhanced by the metabolic inhibitor carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Tomato and rice roots rapidly reduce arsenate to arsenite, some of which is actively effluxed to the medium. The study reveals a new aspect of As metabolism in plants.
