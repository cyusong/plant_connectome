One of the best-characterized physiological rhythms in plants is the circadian rhythm of CO(2) metabolism in Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants, which is the focus here. The central components of the plant circadian clock have been studied in detail only in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Full-length cDNAs have been obtained encoding orthologs of CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1)/LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), EARLY FLOWERING4 (ELF4), ZEITLUPE (ZTL), FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT F-BOX1 (FKF1), EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3), and a partial cDNA encoding GIGANTEA in the model stress-inducible CAM plant, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (Common Ice Plant). TOC1 and LHY/CCA1 are under reciprocal circadian control in a manner similar to their regulation in Arabidopsis. ELF4, FKF1, ZTL, GIGANTEA, and ELF3 are under circadian control in C(3) and CAM leaves. ELF4 transcripts peak in the evening and are unaffected by CAM induction. FKF1 shows an abrupt transcript peak 3 h before subjective dusk. ELF3 transcripts appear in the evening, consistent with their role in gating light input to the circadian clock. Intriguingly, ZTL transcripts do not oscillate in Arabidopsis, but do in M. crystallinum. The transcript abundance of the clock-associated genes in M. crystallinum is largely unaffected by development and salt stress, revealing compensation of the central circadian clock against development and abiotic stress in addition to the well-known temperature compensation. Importantly, the clock in M. crystallinum is very similar to that in Arabidopsis, indicating that such a clock could control CAM without requiring additional components of the central oscillator or a novel CAM oscillator.
