Activation of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis is a trigger to elicit ABA-mediated biological events. We recently reported that drought-induced ABA biosynthesis occurs predominantly in vascular parenchyma cells. This work also showed that a particular set of drought inducible gene expressions initiated in the vascular system. The spatial constraint of ABA biosynthesis is supposed to be critical for directing systemic stress responses. Cellular competence to synthesize ABA and its responsiveness to developmental and environmental signals is discussed.
