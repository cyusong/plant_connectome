Determining how genes are associated with traits in plants and other organisms is a major challenge in modern biology. The unPAK project - undergraduates phenotyping Arabidopsis knockouts - has generated phenotype data for thousands of non-lethal insertion mutation lines within a single Arabidopsis thaliana genomic background. The focal phenotypes examined by unPAK are complex macroscopic fitness-related traits, which have ecological, evolutionary and agricultural importance. These phenotypes are placed in the context of the wild-type and also natural accessions (phytometers), and standardized for environmental differences between assays. Data from the unPAK project are used to describe broad patterns in the phenotypic consequences of insertion mutation, and to identify individual mutant lines with distinct phenotypes as candidates for further study. Inclusion of undergraduate researchers is at the core of unPAK activities, and an important broader impact of the project is providing students an opportunity to obtain research experience.
