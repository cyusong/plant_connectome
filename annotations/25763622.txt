Higher plants have 2 GOGAT species, Fd-GOGAT and NADH-GOGAT. While Fd-GOGAT mainly assimilates ammonium in leaves, which is derived from photorespiration, the function of NADH-GOGAT, which is highly expressed in roots, (1) needs to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of NADH-GOGAT in Arabidopsis roots. The supply of ammonium to the roots caused an accumulation of NADH-GOGAT, while Fd-GOGAT 1 and Fd-GOGAT 2 showed no response. A promoter-GUS fusion analysis and immunohistochemistry showed that NADH-GOGAT was located in non-green tissues like vascular bundles, shoot apical meristem, pollen, stigma, and roots. The localization of NADH-GOGAT and Fd-GOGAT was not overlapped. NADH-GOGAT T-DNA insertion lines showed a reduction of glutamate and biomass under normal CO2 conditions. These data emphasizes the importance of NADH-GOGAT in the ammonium assimilation of Arabidopsis roots.

Fd-GOGAT: !assimilates! ammonium in leaves
NADH-GOGAT: !accumulates! with supply of ammonium to roots
NADH-GOGAT: !localizes to! non-green tissues
NADH-GOGAT: !not overlapped with! Fd-GOGAT
NADH-GOGAT T-DNA insertion lines: !reduce! glutamate and biomass
