Pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) are required for host defense against pathogens. While PTI and ETI are intimately connected, molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here we showed that flg22 priming attenuates Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst) AvrRpt2-induced hypersensitive cell death, resistance, and biomass reduction in Arabidopsis. MAPKs are the key signaling regulators of PTI and ETI. The absence of MPK3 and MPK6 significantly reduces pre-PTI-mediated ETI suppression (PES). MPK3/MPK6 interacts with and phosphorylates the downstream transcription factor WRKY18, which regulates the expression of two protein phosphatases, AP2C1 and PP2C5. Furthermore, the PTI-suppressed ETI-triggered cell death, MAPK activation, and growth retardation were significantly attenuated in wrky18/40/60 and ap2c1 pp2c5 mutants. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the MPK3/MPK6-WRKYs-PP2Cs module underlies PES and is essential for the maintenance of plant fitness during ETI.
