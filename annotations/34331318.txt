Chloroplasts play crucial roles in plant defence against viral infection. We now report that chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex M subunit gene (NdhM) was first up-regulated and then down-regulated in turnip mosaic virus (TuMV)-infected N. benthamiana. NbNdhM-silenced plants were more susceptible to TuMV, whereas overexpression of NbNdhM inhibited TuMV accumulation. Overexpression of NbNdhM significantly induced the clustering of chloroplasts around the nuclei and disturbing this clustering facilitated TuMV infection, suggesting that the clustering mediated by NbNdhM is a defence against TuMV. It was then shown that NbNdhM interacted with TuMV VPg, and that the NdhMs of different plant species interacted with the proteins of different viruses, implying that NdhM may be a common target of viruses. In the presence of TuMV VPg, NbNdhM, which is normally localized in the nucleus, chloroplasts, cell periphery and chloroplast stromules, colocalized with VPg at the nucleus and nucleolus, with significantly increased nuclear accumulation, while NbNdhM-mediated chloroplast clustering was significantly impaired. This study therefore indicates that NbNdhM has a defensive role in TuMV infection probably by inducing the perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts, and that the localization of NbNdhM is altered by its interaction with TuMV VPg in a way that promotes virus infection.
