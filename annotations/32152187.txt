Since the discovery two decades ago that transgenes are efficiently integrated into the genome of <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> by homologous recombination, this moss has been a premier model system to study evolutionary developmental biology questions, stem cell reprogramming, and the biology of nonvascular plants. <i>P</i> <i>patens</i> was the first non-seed plant to have its genome sequenced. With this level of genomic information, together with increasing molecular genetic tools, a large number of reverse genetic studies have propelled the use of this model system. A number of technological advances have recently opened the door to forward genetics as well as extremely efficient and precise genome editing in <i>P</i> <i>patens</i> Additionally, careful phylogenetic studies with increased resolution have suggested that <i>P</i> <i>patens</i> emerged from within <i>Physcomitrium</i> Thus, rather than <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>, the species should be named <i>Physcomitrium patens</i> Here we review these advances and describe the areas where <i>P</i> <i>patens</i> has had the most impact on plant biology.
