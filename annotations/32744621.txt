Patterns of indeterminate and determinate growth specify plant architecture and influence crop productivity. In cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT) stimulates the transition to flowering and determinate growth, while its closely related antagonist SELF-PRUNING (SP) maintains meristems in indeterminate states to favor vegetative growth. Overexpressing GhSFT while simultaneously silencing GhSP produces highly determinate cotton with reduced foliage and synchronous fruiting. These findings suggest that GhSFT, GhSP, and genes in these signaling networks hold promise for enhancing 'annualized' growth patterns and improving cotton productivity and management. To identify the molecular programs underlying cotton growth habits, we used comparative co-expression networks, differential gene expression, and phenotypic analyses in cotton varieties expressing altered levels of GhSFT or GhSP. Using multiple cotton and tomato datasets, we identified diverse genetic modules highly correlated with SFT or SP orthologs which shared related Gene Ontologies in different crop species. Notably, altering GhSFT or GhSP levels in cotton affected the expression of genes regulating meristem fate and metabolic pathways. Further phenotypic analyses of gene products involved in photosynthesis, secondary metabolism, and cell wall biosynthesis showed that early changes in GhSFT and GhSP levels profoundly impacted later development in distal tissues. Identifying the molecular underpinnings of GhSFT and GhSP activities emphasizes their broad actions in regulating cotton architecture.
