A novel and major QTL for the effective tiller number was identified on chromosomal arm 1BL and validated in two genetic backgrounds The effective tiller number (ETN) substantially influences plant architecture and the wheat yield improvement. In this study, we constructed a genetic map of the 2SY (20828/SY95-71) recombinant inbred line population based on the Wheat 55K array as well as the simple sequence repeat (SSR) and Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers. A comparison between the genetic and physical maps indicated the marker positions were consistent in the two maps. Additionally, we identified seven tillering-related quantitative trait locus (QTLs), including Qetn-sau-1B.1, which is a major QTL localized to a 6.17-cM interval flanked by markers AX-89635557 and AX-111544678 on chromosome 1BL. The Qetn-sau-1B.1 QTL was detected in eight environments and explained 12.12-55.71% of the phenotypic variance. Three genes associated with the ETN were detected in the physical interval of Qetn-sau-1B.1. We used a tightly linked KASP marker, KASP-AX-110129912, to further validate this QTL in two other populations with different genetic backgrounds. The results indicated that Qetn-sau-1B.1 significantly increased the ETN by up to 23.5%. The results of this study will be useful for the precise mapping and cloning of Qetn-sau-1B.1.
