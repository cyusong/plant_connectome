Species with various reproductive modes accompanied by different mechanical properties of their (lateral) branch-branch junctions have evolved in the cactus subfamily Opuntioideae. Older branches of <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i> with fracture-resistant junctions often bear flowers and fruits for sexual reproduction, whereas younger branches break off easily and provide offshoots for vegetative propagation. <i>Cylindropuntia bigelovii</i> plants are known for their vegetative reproduction <i>via</i> easily detachable branches that can establish themselves as offshoots. We characterized the elastic and fracture behaviors of these lateral junctions by tensile testing and analyzed local strains during loading. Additionally, we carried out finite element analyses to quantify the influence of five relevant tissue layers on joint elastic behavior. Our fracture analysis revealed various fracture modes: (i) most young samples of <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i> failed directly at the junction and had smooth fracture surfaces, and relative fracture strain was on median 4% of the total strain; (ii) most older samples of <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i> failed at the adjacent branch and exhibited rough fracture surfaces, and relative fracture strain was on median 47%; (iii) most samples of <i>Cylindropuntia bigelovii</i> abscised directly at the junction and exhibited cup and cone surfaces, and relative fracture strain was on median 28%. Various geometric and mechanical properties such as junction area, fracture energy, and tensile strength were analyzed with respect to significant differences between species and age of sample. Interestingly, the abscission of lateral branches naturally triggered by wind, passing animals, or vibration showed the following differences in maximum force: 153 N (older <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i>), 51 N (young <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i>), and 14 N (<i>Cylindropuntia bigelovii</i>).
