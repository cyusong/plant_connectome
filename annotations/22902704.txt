PPR (Pentatricopeptide repeat) proteins are mainly involved in RNA metabolism. In Arabidopsis, the PPR family is composed of more than 450 members; however, only few of them were functionally characterized. In a previous report, ( 1) we identified a novel mitochondrial PPR RNA editing factor, named SLO2, which is responsible for 7 editing events in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function mutation in SLO2 results in plant growth retardation, and delayed development, and leads to the dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I, III and IV. slo2 is the first example of a single gene mutation affecting 3 complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This Short Communication discusses the conservation of upstream regions of editing sites affected by SLO2 and illustrates the effect of mutation of SLO2 on activation of the alternative pathway. We also reflect upon the implications and perspectives of these findings.
