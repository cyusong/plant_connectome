In diatoms, the non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) regulates photosynthesis during light fluctuations. NPQ is associated with an enzymatic xanthophyll cycle (XC) which is controlled by the light-driven transthylakoid proton gradient (delta pH). In this report, special illumination conditions and chemicals were used to perturb the kinetics of the delta pH build-up, of the XC and of NPQ. We found that the delta pH-related acidification of the lumen is also needed for NPQ to develop by switching the xanthophylls to an 'activated' state, probably via the protonation of light-harvesting antenna proteins. It confirms the NPQ model previously proposed for diatoms.
