In Hordeum vulgare, nine differentially expressed novel miRNAs were induced by colchicine. Five novel miRNA in colchicine solution showed the opposite expression patterns as those in water. Colchicine is a commonly used agent for plant chromosome set doubling. MicroRNA-mediated responses to colchicine treatment in plants have not been characterized. Here, we characterized new microRNAs induced by colchicine treatment in Hordeum vulgare using high-throughput sequencing. Our results showed that 39 differentially expressed miRNAs were affected by water treatment, including 34 novel miRNAs and 5 known miRNAs; 42 miRNAs, including 37 novel miRNAs and 5 known miRNAs, were synergistically affected by colchicine and water, and 9 differentially expressed novel miRNAs were induced by colchicine. The novel_mir69, novel_mir57, novel_mir75, novel_mir38, and novel_mir56 in colchicine treatment showed the opposite expression patterns as those in water. By analyzing these 9 differentially expressed novel miRNAs and their targets, we found that novel_mir69, novel_mir56 and novel_mir25 co-target the genes involving the DNA repair pathway. Based on our results, microRNA-target regulation network under colchicine treatment was proposed, which involves actin, cell cycle regulation, cell wall synthesis, and the regulation of oxidative stress. Overall, the results demonstrated the critical role of microRNAs mediated responses to colchicine treatment in plants.
