['20059743', "RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is an important epigenetic mechanism for  silencing transgenes and endogenous repetitive sequences such as transposons. The  RD29A promoter-driven LUCIFERASE transgene and its corresponding endogenous RD29A  gene are hypermethylated and silenced in the Arabidopsis DNA demethylase mutant  ros1. By screening for second-site suppressors of ros1, we identified the RDM12  locus. The rdm12 mutation releases the silencing of the RD29A-LUC transgene and  the endogenous RD29A gene by reducing the promoter DNA methylation. The rdm12  mutation also reduces DNA methylation at endogenous RdDM target loci, including  transposons and other repetitive sequences. In addition, the rdm12 mutation  affects the levels of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from some of the RdDM  target loci. RDM12 encodes a protein with XS and coiled-coil domains, and is  similar to SGS3, which is a partner protein of RDR6 and can bind to  double-stranded RNAs with a 5' overhang, and is required for several  post-transcriptional gene silencing pathways. Our results show that RDM12 is a  component of the RdDM pathway, and suggest that RdDM may involve double-stranded  RNAs with a 5' overhang and the partnering between RDM12 and RDR2.", '2010 Apr 1', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04130.x', 'Zhu']
