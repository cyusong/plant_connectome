Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR), caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is the most serious disease affecting the yield of the agriculturally and economically important crop Brassica napus (rapeseed). In this study, Oryza sativa polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein 2 (OsPGIP2) was found to effectively enhanced rapeseed immunity against S. sclerotiorum infection. Leaf extracts of B. napus plants overexpressing OsPGIP2 showed enhanced S. sclerotiorum resistance by delaying pathogen infection. The constitutive expression of OsPGIP2 in rapeseed plants provided a rapid and effective defense response, which included the production of reactive oxygen species, interactions with S. sclerotiorum polygalacturonases (SsPG3 and SsPG6), and effects on the expression of defense genes. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the pathogen induced many differentially expressed genes associated with pathogen recognition, redox homeostasis, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades, hormone signaling pathways, pathogen-/defense-related genes, and cell wall-related genes. The overexpression of OsPGIP2 also led to constitutively increased cell wall cellulose and hemicellulose contents in stems without compromising seed quality. The results demonstrate that OsPGIP2 plays a major role in rapeseed defense mechanisms, and we propose a model for OsPGIP2-conferred resistance to S. sclerotiorum in these plants.
