Sessile plants are continuously threatened by biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. Since stress responses are in general accompanied by growth retardation, plants in nature should tightly control timing and duration of their stress responses for sustained growth. We previously reported that vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) 721 and 722 are required for growth/development and stress responses in plants. It is suggested that plants regulate expression of <i>VAMP721/722</i> and/or drive VAMP721/722 to form distinct SNARE complexes with different plasma membrane (PM)-residing SNARE proteins in response to distinct stimuli. We here report that immune signaling triggered by the bacterial flg22 elicitor elevates VAMP721/722 levels in calreticulin 1 and 2 (CRT1/2)-lacking plants. Since VAMP721/722 amounts were reported not to be increased by an ER stress inducer, tunicamycin in <i>crt1/2</i> plants, our results suggest that ER stress and immune signalings distinctly control cellular abundance of VAMP721/722.
