Most C4 plants that naturally occur in tropical or subtropical climates, in high light environments, had to evolve a series of adaptations of photosynthesis that allowed them to grow under these conditions. In this review, we summarize mechanisms that ensure the balancing of energy distribution, counteract photoinhibition, and allow the dissipation of excess light energy. They secure effective electron transport in light reactions of photosynthesis, which will lead to the production of NADPH and ATP. Furthermore, a higher content of the cyclic electron transport components and an increase in ATP production are observed, which is necessary for the metabolism of C4 for effective assimilation of CO<sub>2</sub>. Most of the data are provided by studies of the genus <i>Flaveria</i>, where species belonging to different metabolic subtypes and intermediate forms between C3 and C4 are present. All described mechanisms that function in mesophyll and bundle sheath chloroplasts, into which photosynthetic reactions are divided, may differ in metabolic subtypes as a result of the different organization of thylakoid membranes, as well as the different demand for ATP and NADPH. This indicates that C4 plants have plasticity in the utilization of pathways in which efficient use and dissipation of excitation energy are realized.
