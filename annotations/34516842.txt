Plants respond to temperature changes by modulating florigen activity to optimize the timing of flowering. We show that the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mobile florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) interacts with the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) at cellular membranes and binds the lipid bilayer. Perturbing PG biosynthesis in phloem companion cells leads to temperature-insensitive early flowering. Low temperatures facilitate FT sequestration in the cellular membrane of the companion cell, thus reducing soluble FT levels and delaying flowering. A mutant in <i>PHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROLPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1</i> accumulates more soluble FT at lower temperatures and exhibits reduced temperature sensitivity. Thus, cellular membranes sequester FT through their ability to bind the phospholipid PG, and this sequestration modulates the plant’s response to temperature changes.
