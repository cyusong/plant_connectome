Diploid organisms contain a maternal and a paternal genome complement that is thought to provide robustness and allow developmental progression despite genetic perturbations that occur in heterozygosity. However, changes affecting gene dosage from the chromosome down to the individual gene level possess a significant pathological potential and can lead to developmental disorders (DDs). This indicates that expression from a balanced gene complement is highly relevant for proper cellular and organismal function in eukaryotes. Paradoxically, gene and whole chromosome duplications are a principal driver of evolution, while heteromorphic sex chromosomes (XY and ZW) are naturally occurring aneuploidies important for sex determination. Here, we provide an overview of the biology of gene dosage at the crossroads between evolutionary benefit and pathogenicity during disease. We describe the buffering mechanisms and cellular responses to alterations, which could provide a common ground for the understanding of DDs caused by copy number alterations.
