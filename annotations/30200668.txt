A variety of malignant cancers affect the global human population. Although a wide variety of approaches to cancer treatment have been studied and used clinically (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy), the toxic side effects of cancer therapies have a negative impact on patients and impede progress in conquering cancer. Plant metabolites are emerging as new leads for anti-cancer drug development. This review summarizes these plant metabolites with regard to their structures and the types of cancer against which they show activity, organized by the organ or tissues in which each cancer forms. This information will be helpful for understanding the current state of knowledge of the anti-cancer effects of various plant metabolites against major types of cancer for the further development of novel anti-cancer drugs.
