Toc64 has been suggested to be part of the chloroplast import machinery in Pisum sativum. A role for Toc64 in protein transport has not been established, however. To address this, we generated knockout mutants in the moss Physcomitrella patens using the moss's ability to perform homologous recombination with nuclear DNA. Physcomitrella patens contains two genes that encode Toc64-like proteins. Both of those proteins appear to be localized in the chloroplast. The double-mutant plants were lacking Toc64 protein in the chloroplasts but showed no growth phenotype. In addition, these plants accumulated other plastid proteins at wild-type levels and showed no difference from wild type in in vitro protein import assays. These plants did have a slightly altered chloroplast shape in some tissues, however. The evidence therefore indicates that Toc64 proteins are not required for import of proteins in Physcomitrella, but may point to involvement in the determination of plastid shape.
