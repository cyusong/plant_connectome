We investigate the modulation of circumnutation in inflorescence stems of Arabidopsis to determine the circadian regulation of circumnutation. Under constant light conditions (LL), circumnutation speed in wild-type plants fluctuates, with the phase of the highest speed at subjective dawn; the period length is close to 24 h. toc1 appears to shorten the period and elf3 causes an arrhythmic phenotype in circumnutation speed in LL, suggesting that a common circadian clock may control both circumnutation speed and other circadian outputs. These results highlight for the first time a role for a circadian clock in the regulation of circumnutation based on genetic analysis of Arabidopsis.
