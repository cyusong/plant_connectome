High ammonium suppresses hybrid incompatibility between Ler and Kas-2 accessions through lowering nitric oxide levels and nitrate reductase activity required for autoimmunity. The immune-related hybrid incompatibility (HI) between Landsberg erecta (Ler) and Kashmir-2 (Kas-2) accessions is due to a deleterious genetic interaction between the RPP1 (RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA1)-like Ler locus and Kas-2 alleles of the receptor-like kinase SRF3 (STRUBBELIG RECEPTOR FAMILY 3). The genetic incompatibility is temperature-dependent and leads to constitutive activation of the salicylic acid (SA) pathway, dwarfism and cell death at 14-16 °C. Here we investigated the effect of nutrition on the occurrence of Ler/Kas-2 HI and found that high ammonium suppresses Ler/Kas-2 incompatible phenotypes independently of the ammonium/nitrate ratio. Ammonium feeding leads to compromised disease resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, lower total SA, nitric oxide and nitrate reductase activity in Ler/Kas-2 incompatible hybrids. In addition, we find that Ler/Kas-2 incompatibility is dependent on NPR1 (NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES 1) and nitric oxide production. Overall, this work highlights the effect of nutrition on the expression of incompatible phenotypes independently of temperature.
