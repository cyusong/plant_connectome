Small signalling peptides play important roles in various plant processes, but information regarding their involvement in plant immunity is limited. We previously identified a novel small secreted protein in rice, called immune response peptide 1 (IRP1). Here, we studied the function of IRP1 in rice immunity. Rice plants overexpressing IRP1 enhanced resistance to the virulent rice blast fungus. Application of synthetic IRP1 to rice suspension cells triggered the expression of IRP1 itself and the defence gene phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1 (PAL1). RNA-seq results revealed that 84% of genes up-regulated by IRP1, including 13 OsWRKY transcription factors, were also induced by a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP), chitin, indicating that IRP1 and chitin share a similar signalling pathway. Co-treatment with chitin and IRP1 elevated the expression level of PAL1 and OsWRKYs in an additive manner. The increased chitin concentration arrested the induction of IRP1 and PAL1 expression by IRP1, but did not affect IRP1-triggered mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation. Collectively, our findings indicate that IRP1 functions as a phytocytokine in rice immunity regulating MAPKs and OsWRKYs that can amplify chitin and other signalling pathways, and provide new insights into how MAMPs and phytocytokines cooperatively regulate rice immunity.
