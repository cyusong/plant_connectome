The phytotoxicity of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) to plant seeds germination and seedlings development depends on nanoparticles properties and concentration, as well as plant species and stress tolerance degrees. In the present study, the effect of citrate-stabilized spherical Ag NPs (20 mg/L) in sizes of 10, 20, 40, 60, and 100 nm, on wheat grain germination, early seedlings development, and polar metabolite profile in 3-day-old seedlings were analyzed. Ag NPs, regardless of their sizes, did not affect the germination of wheat grains. However, the smaller nanoparticles (10 and 20 nm in size) decreased the growth of seedling roots. Although the concentrations of total polar metabolites in roots, coleoptile, and endosperm of seedlings were not affected by Ag NPs, significant re-arrangements of carbohydrates profiles in seedlings were noted. In roots and coleoptile of 3-day-old seedlings, the concentration of sucrose increased, which was accompanied by a decrease in glucose and fructose. The concentrations of most other polar metabolites (amino acids, organic acids, and phosphate) were not affected by Ag NPs. Thus, an unknown signal is released by small-sized Ag NPs that triggers affection of sugars metabolism and/or distribution.
