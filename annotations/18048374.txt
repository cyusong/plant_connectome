Wide variation for morphological traits exists in Brassica rapa and the genetic basis of this morphological variation is largely unknown. Here is a report on quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of flowering time, seed and pod traits, growth-related traits, leaf morphology, and turnip formation in B. rapa using multiple populations. The populations resulted from crosses between the following accessions: Rapid cycling, Chinese cabbage, Yellow sarson, Pak choi, and a Japanese vegetable turnip variety. A total of 27 QTL affecting 20 morphological traits were detected, including eight QTL for flowering time, six for seed traits, three for growth-related traits and 10 for leaf traits. One major QTL was found for turnip formation. Principal component analysis and co-localization of QTL indicated that some loci controlling leaf and seed-related traits and those for flowering time and turnip formation might be the same. The major flowering time QTL detected in all populations on linkage group R02 co-localized with BrFLC2. One major QTL, controlling turnip formation, was also mapped at this locus. The genes that may underly this QTL and comparative analyses between the four populations and with Arabidopsis thaliana are discussed.
