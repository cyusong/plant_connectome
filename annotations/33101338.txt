Tillering is an important biomass yield component trait in switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum L</i>.). <i>Teosinte branched 1</i> (<i>tb1</i>)/<i>Branched 1</i> (<i>BRC1</i>) gene is a known regulator for tillering/branching in several plant species; however, its role on tillering in switchgrass remains unknown. Here, we report physiological and molecular characterization of mutants created by CRISPR/Cas9. We successfully obtained nonchimeric <i>Pvtb1a</i> and <i>Pvtb1b</i> mutants from chimeric T0 mutants using nodal culture. The biallelic <i>Pvtb1a-Pvtb1b</i> mutant plants produced significantly more tillers and higher fresh weight biomass than the wild-type plants. The increased tiller number in the mutant plants resulted primarily from hastened outgrowth of lower axillary buds. Increased tillers were also observed in transgene-free BC1 monoallelic mutants for either <i>Pvtb1a-Pvtb1b</i> or <i>Pvtb1b</i> gene alone, suggesting <i>Pvtb1</i> genes act in a dosage-dependent manner. Transcriptome analysis showed 831 genes were differentially expressed in the <i>Pvtb1</i>a-<i>Pvtb1b</i> double knockdown mutant. Gene Ontology analysis revealed downregulation of <i>Pvtb1</i> genes affected multiple biological processes, including transcription, flower development, cell differentiation, and stress/defense responses in edited plants. This study demonstrates that <i>Pvtb1</i> genes play a pivotal role in tiller production as a negative regulator in switchgrass and provides opportunities for further research aiming to elucidate the molecular pathway regulating tillering in switchgrass.
