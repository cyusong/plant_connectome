Plants are exposed to several biotic and abiotic stresses. A common environmental stress that plants have to face both in natural and agricultural ecosystems that impacts both its growth and development is low phosphate (Pi) availability. There has been an important progress in the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which plants cope with Pi deficiency. However, the mechanisms that mediate alterations in the architecture of the Arabidopsis root system responses to Pi starvation are still largely unknown. One of the most conspicuous developmental effects of low Pi on the Arabidopsis root system is the inhibition of primary root growth that is accompanied by loss of root meristematic activity. To identify signalling pathways potentially involved in the Arabidpsis root meristem response to Pi-deprivation, here we report the global gene expression analysis of the root tip of wild type and low phosphorus insensitive4 (lpi4) mutant grown under Pi limiting conditions. Differential gene expression analysis and physiological experiments show that changes in the redox status, probably mediated by jasmonic acid and ethylene, play an important role in the primary root meristem exhaustion process triggered by Pi-starvation.
