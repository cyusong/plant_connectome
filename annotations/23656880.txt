Brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate various physiological processes, such as tolerance to stresses and root growth. Recently, a connection was reported between BRs and nitric oxide (NO) in plant responses to abiotic stress. Here we present evidence supporting NO functions in BR signaling during root growth process. Arabidopsis seedlings treated with BR 24-epibrassinolide (BL) show increased lateral roots (LR) density, inhibition of primary root (PR) elongation and NO accumulation. Similar effects were observed adding the NO donor GSNO to BR-receptor mutant bri1-1. Furthermore, BL-induced responses in the root were abolished by the specific NO scavenger c-PTIO. The activities of nitrate reductase (NR) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like, two NO generating enzymes were involved in BR signaling. These results demonstrate that BR increases the NO concentration in root cells, which is required for BR-induced changes in root architecture.
