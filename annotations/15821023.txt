To determine the role of alpha-amylase isoform I-1 in the degradation of starch in rice leaf chloroplasts, we generated a series of transgenic rice plants with suppressed expression or overexpression of alpha-amylase I-1. In the lines with suppressed expression of alpha-amylase I-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels, seed germination and seedling growth were markedly delayed in comparison with those in the wild-type plants. However, the growth retardation was overcome by supplementation of sugars. Interestingly, a significant increase of starch accumulation in the young leaf tissues was observed under a sugar-supplemented condition. In contrast, the starch content of leaves was reduced in the plants overexpressing alpha-amylase I-1. In immunocytochemical analysis with specific anti-alpha-amylase I-1 antiserum, immuno-gold particles deposited in the chloroplasts and extracellular space in young leaf cells. We further examined the expression and targeting of alpha-amylase I-1 fused with the green fluorescent protein in re-differentiated green cells, and showed that the fluorescence of the expressed fusion protein co-localized with the chlorophyll autofluorescence in the transgenic cells. In addition, mature protein species of alpha-amylase I-1 bearing an oligosaccharide side chain were detected in the isolated chloroplasts. Based on these results, we concluded that alpha-amylase I-1 targets the chloroplasts through the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi system and plays a significant role in the starch degradation in rice leaves.
