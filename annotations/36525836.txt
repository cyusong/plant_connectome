Mahonia bealei and Mahonia fortunei are important plant resources in Traditional Chinese Medicine that are valued for their high levels of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs). Although the phytotoxic activity of BIAs has been recognized, information is limited on the mechanism of action by which these compounds regulate photosynthetic activity. Here, we performed comparative chloroplast genome analysis to examine insertions and deletions in the two species. We found a GATA-motif located in the promoter region of the ndhF gene of only M. bealei. K-mer frequency-based diversity analysis illustrated the close correlation between the GATA-motif and leaf phenotype. We found that the GATA-motif significantly inhibits GUS gene expression in tobacco during the dark-light transition (DLT). The expression of ndhF was downregulated in M. bealei and upregulated in M. fortunei during the DLT. NDH-F activity was remarkably decreased and exhibited a significant negative correlation with BIA levels in M. bealei during the DLT. Furthermore, the NADPH produced through photosynthetic metabolism was found to decrease in M. bealei during the DLT. Taken together, our results indicate that this GATA-motif might act as the functional site by which BIAs inhibit photosynthetic metabolism through downregulating ndhF expression during the DLT.
