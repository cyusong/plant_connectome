['11340187', 'The role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins[1,4,5]P3) in transducing the  abscisic acid (ABA) signal during seed germination and in the stress responses of  mature plants is poorly understood. We have considered the contributions of the  phospholipase C1 (encoded by AtPLC1) and an Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (encoded  by AtIP5PII) to ABA signaling by using a modified version of the  glucocorticoid-inducible system to regulate transgene expression. In the presence  of the dexamethasone (Dex) inducer, transgenic lines expressing the AtPLC1  antisense and AtIP5PII sense transgenes showed no inhibition of germination and  growth by ABA, whereas in the absence of the inducer they were sensitive. In the  presence of Dex, these lines accumulated lower Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels upon ABA  treatment compared with that of the control transgenic lines. RNA gel blot  analysis revealed a decrease in the induction of the ABA-responsive genes RD29a,  KIN2, and RD22 but not COR47 in the Dex-induced transgenic plants. In transgenic  lines expressing the inducible AtPLC1 sense transgene, an increase in AtPLC1  expression was not sufficient to activate the expression of ABA-responsive genes  in vegetative tissues. In vitro experiments demonstrated the induced PLC1  expression when extracts were assayed in the presence of calcium, but no increase  in Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels in vivo was detected, suggesting that the PLC1 enzyme was  latent. Our results indicate that although an increase in PLC1 activity and  increased Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels are necessary for maximal gene induction by ABA,  overexpression of AtPLC1 itself is not sufficient to trigger the expression of  ABA-responsive genes. We propose that AtPLC1 plays a role in secondary ABA  responses.', '2001 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.13.5.1143', 'Chua']
