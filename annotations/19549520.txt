['19549520', "AtCYP20-2 is one of 16 immunophilins in thylakoid lumen. The presence of the  isomerase domain in AtCYP20-2, an enrichment of AtCYP20-2 in the stroma membranes  and it's co-migration with NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) in native gels provide  evidence that AtCYP20-2 is an auxiliary protein of NDH. When different NDH  mutants were studied, AtCYP20-2 was found to be strongly reduced especially in  mutants deficient in the membrane domain of NDH, thus suggesting a role in the  assembly of NDH hydrophobic domain. Lack of AtCYP20-2, however, did not lead to  severe malfunction of NDH, indicating redundancy in the function of lumenal  immunophilins.", '2009 Jul 21', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2009.06.031', 'Aro']
