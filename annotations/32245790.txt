The plant hormone jasmonate (JA) promotes resistance to biotic stress by stimulating the degradation of JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins, which relieves repression on MYC transcription factors that execute defense programs. JA-triggered depletion of JAZ proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is also associated with reduced growth and seed production, but the mechanisms underlying these pleiotropic growth effects remain unclear. Here, we investigated this question using an Arabidopsis JAZ-deficient mutant (<i>jazD</i>; <i>jaz1-jaz7</i>, <i>jaz9</i>, <i>jaz10</i>, and <i>jaz</i> <i>13</i>) that exhibits high levels of defense and strong growth inhibition. Genetic suppressor screens for mutations that uncouple growth-defense tradeoffs in the <i>jazD</i> mutant identified nine independent causal mutations in the red-light receptor phytochrome B (phyB). Unlike the ability of the <i>phyB</i> mutations to completely uncouple the mild growth-defense phenotypes in a <i>jaz</i> mutant (<i>jazQ</i>) defective in <i>JAZ1</i>, <i>JAZ3</i>, <i>JAZ4</i>, <i>JAZ9</i>, and <i>JAZ10</i>, <i>phyB</i> null alleles only weakly alleviated the growth and reproductive defects in the <i>jazD</i> mutant. phyB-independent growth restriction of the <i>jazD</i> mutant was tightly correlated with upregulation of the Trp biosynthetic pathway but not with changes in central carbon metabolism. Interestingly, <i>jazD</i> and <i>jazD phyB</i> plants were insensitive to a chemical inhibitor of Trp biosynthesis, which is a phenotype previously observed in plants expressing hyperactive MYC transcription factors that cannot bind JAZ repressors. These data provide evidence that the mechanisms underlying JA-mediated growth-defense balance depend on the level of defense, and they further establish an association between growth inhibition at high levels of defense and dysregulation of Trp biosynthesis.
