Although the signalling pathway of blue light (BL)-dependent stomatal opening is well characterized, little is known about the interspecific diversity, the role it plays in the regulation of gas exchange and the source of energy used to drive the commonly observed increase in pore aperture. Using a combination of red and BL under ambient and low [O<sub>2</sub> ] (to inhibit respiration), the interaction between BL, photosynthesis and respiration in determining stomatal conductance was investigated. These findings were used to develop a novel model to predict the feedback between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance under these conditions. Here we demonstrate that BL-induced stomatal responses are far from universal, and that significant species-specific differences exist in terms of both rapidity and magnitude. Increased stomatal conductance under BL reduced photosynthetic limitation, at the expense of water loss. Moreover, we stress the importance of the synergistic effect of BL and respiration in driving rapid stomatal movements, especially when photosynthesis is limited. These observations will help reshape our understanding of diurnal gas exchange in order to exploit the dynamic coordination between the rate of carbon assimilation (A) and stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub> ), as a target for enhancing crop performance and water use efficiency.
