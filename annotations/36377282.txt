Blue aleurone of barley is caused by the accumulation of delphinidin-based derivatives. Although these compounds are ideal nutrients for human health, they are undesirable contaminants in malt brewing. Therefore, the ability to add and remove this trait easily would facilitate breeding barley for different purposes. Here we identified a glutathione S-transferase gene (HvGST) that was responsible for the blue aleurone trait in Tibetan qingke barley by performing a genome-wide association study and RNA-sequencing analysis. Gene variation and expression analysis indicated that HvGST also participates in the transport and accumulation of anthocyanin in purple barley. Haplotype and the geographic distribution analyses of HvGST alleles revealed two independent natural variants responsible for the emergence of white aleurone: a 203-bp deletion causing premature termination of translation in qingke barley and two key single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter resulting in low transcription in Western barley. This study contributes to a better understanding of mechanisms of colored barley formation, and provides a comprehensive reference for marker-assisted barley breeding.
