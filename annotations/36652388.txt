Carbon and nitrogen are the two main nutrients in maize (Zea mays L.) kernels, and kernel filling and metabolism determine seed formation and germination. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between kernel filling and corresponding carbon and nitrogen metabolism remain largely unknown. Here, we found that HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 90.6 (HSP90.6) is involved in both seed filling and the metabolism processes of carbon and nitrogen. A single-amino acid mutation within the HATPase_c domain of HSP90.6 led to small kernels. Transcriptome profiling showed that the expression of amino acid biosynthesis- and carbon metabolism-related genes was significantly downregulated in the hsp90.6 mutant. Further molecular evidence showed strong interactions between HSP90.6 and the 26S proteasome subunits REGULATORY PARTICLE NON-ATPASE6 (RPN6) and PROTEASOME BETA SUBUNITD2 (PBD2). The mutation of hsp90.6 significantly reduced the activity of the 26S proteasome, resulting in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and defects in nitrogen recycling. Moreover, we verified that HSP90.6 is involved in carbon metabolism through interacting with the 14-3-3 protein GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14-4 (GF14-4). Collectively, our findings revealed that HSP90.6 is involved in seed filling and development by interacting with the components controlling carbon and nitrogen metabolism.
