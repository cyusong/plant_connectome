['17543866', 'Although the basic plant body plan is established during embryogenesis, the  molecular basis of embryonic patterning remains to be fully understood. We have  identified two receptor-like kinases, RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE1 (RPK1) and  TOADSTOOL2 (TOAD2), required for Arabidopsis embryonic pattern formation. Genetic  analysis indicates that RPK1 and TOAD2 have overlapping embryonic functions. The  zygotic gene dosage of TOAD2 in an rpk1 background is of critical importance,  suggesting that signaling mediated by RPK1 and TOAD2 must be above a threshold  level for proper embryo development. The localization of RPK1 and TOAD2  translational fusions to GFP coupled with the analysis of cell-type-specific  markers indicate that RPK1 and TOAD2 are redundantly required for both pattern  formation along the radial axis and differentiation of the basal pole during  early embryogenesis. We propose that RPK1 and TOAD2 receive intercellular signals  and mediate intracellular responses that are necessary for embryonic pattern  formation.', '2007 Jun', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2007.04.003', 'Tax']
