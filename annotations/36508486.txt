<i>Acinetobacter schindleri</i> is an endophyte of <i>Pseudostellaria heterophylla</i>, a traditional Chinese herbal plant. It has high degradation activity to toxins produced by fungal pathogen <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>. Here, we deployed PacBio single-molecule real-time long-read sequencing technology to generate a complete genome assembly for the <i>Acinetobacter schindleri</i> H4-3-C1 strain and obtained 1.59 Gb of clean reads. These reads were assembled to a single circular DNA chromosome with a length of 3,265,024 bp, and no plasmid was found in the genome. Totals of 3,193 coding sequences, 91 transfer RNA, 21 ribosomal RNA, and 75 small RNAs were identified in the genome. This high-quality genome assembly and gene annotation resource will facilitate the excavation of the zearalenone degradation gene and provide valuable resources for preventing and controlling toxigenic fungal diseases of <i>P. heterophylla</i>.
