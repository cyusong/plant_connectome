Maize is one of the major crops in the world; however, diseases caused by various pathogens seriously affect its yield and quality. The maize <i>Rp1-D21</i> mutant (mt) caused by the intragenic recombination between two nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, exhibits autoactive hypersensitive response (HR). In this study, we integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) in <i>Rp1-D21</i> mt compared to the wild type (WT). Genes involved in pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) were enriched among the DEGs. The salicylic acid (SA) pathway and the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway were induced at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels. The DAMs identified included lipids, flavones, and phenolic acids, including 2,5-DHBA <i>O</i>-hexoside, the production of which is catalyzed by uridinediphosphate (UDP)-dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT). Four maize <i>UGTs</i> (<i>ZmUGTs)</i> homologous genes were among the DEGs. Functional analysis by transient co-expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> showed that ZmUGT9250 and ZmUGT5174, but not ZmUGT9256 and ZmUGT8707, partially suppressed the HR triggered by Rp1-D21 or its N-terminal coiled-coil signaling domain (CC<sub>D21</sub>). None of the four ZmUGTs interacted physically with CC<sub>D21</sub> in yeast two-hybrid or co-immunoprecipitation assays. We discuss the possibility that ZmUGTs might be involved in defense response by regulating SA homeostasis.
