Timely degradation of anther tapetal cells is a prerequisite for normal pollen development in flowering plants. Although several genes involved in tapetum development have been identified, the molecular basis of tapetum degeneration regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified and characterized the nucleus-encoded, conserved mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase OsALDH2b as a key regulator of tapetum degeneration in rice (Oryza sativa). OsALDH2b was highly expressed in anthers from meiosis to the early microspore stage. Mutation of OsALDH2b resulted in excess malonaldehyde accumulation and earlier programmed cell death in the tapetum, leading to premature tapetum degeneration and abnormal microspore development. These results demonstrate that OsALDH2b negatively regulates tapetal programmed cell death and is required for male reproductive development, providing insights into the regulation of tapetum development in plants.
