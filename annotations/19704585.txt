Volatile terpenoids, the major products among the herbivore-induced plant volatiles in the legume, mediate interactions that attract herbivores' natural enemies and serve as signals to neighboring plants. We recently demonstrated cross-talk among the signaling components involving Ca(2+), jasmonic acid and ethylene, which are altogether responsible for volatile terpenoid formation in Medicago truncatula. Herbivore-stimulated Ca(2+) transients are an additional element that has an impact on the composition of the blend of terpenoids, whose biosynthesis depends on the jasmonic acid/ethylene pathway. The molecular diversity of the blend is expanded and modulated by the transcriptional regulation of terpene synthases, some of which are multi-functional enzymes producing a large set of sesqui- and monotepenes or precursors of C(11) and C16 homoterpenes from different prenyl diphosphates. In this addendum, we discuss a new perspective on early events leading to terpenoid biosynthesis.

Ca2+: !affects! Terpenoid formation
Jasmonic acid/ethylene: !mediates! Interactions
Transcriptional regulation: !modulates! Terpene synthases
Terpene synthases: !synthesize! Sesqui- and monotepenes
