Maize is a globally important crop that was a classic model plant for genetic studies. Here, we report a 2.2 Gb draft genome sequence of an elite maize line, HuangZaoSi (HZS). Hybrids bred from HZS-improved lines (HILs) are planted in more than 60% of maize fields in China. Proteome clustering of six completed sequenced maize genomes show that 638 proteins fall into 264 HZS-specific gene families with the majority of contributions from tandem duplication events. Resequencing and comparative analysis of 40 HZS-related lines reveals the breeding history of HILs. More than 60% of identified selective sweeps were clustered in identity-by-descent conserved regions, and yield-related genes/QTLs were enriched in HZS characteristic selected regions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HZS-specific family genes were not uniformly distributed in the genome but enriched in improvement/function-related genomic regions. This study provides an important and novel resource for maize genome research and expands our knowledge on the breadth of genomic variation and improvement history of maize.
