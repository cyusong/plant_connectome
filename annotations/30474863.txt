Light is essential for the plant establishment. Arabidopsis seedlings germinated in the dark cannot grow leaf and only have closed cotyledons. However, exogenous application of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> can induce leaves (establishment) in the dark. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that light-responsive genes were activated by H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> treatment. These genes are functionally correlated with photosynthesis, photorespiration, and components of photosystem, such as antenna proteins and light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins. We further found that application of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> facilitates cell cycle by accelerating G<sub>2</sub> -M checkpoint transition in shoot apical meristem. Phytochrome-mediated light signalling pathway was also involved in the H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> -facilitated establishment process. The constitutive photomorphogenesis 1 and phytochrome interacting factor 3 proteins were shown to be down-regulated by H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> treatment and accordingly removed their inhibitory effects on photomorphogenesis in the dark. The crosstalk between oxidation and light signal pathways explains the mechanism that H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> regulates plant dark establishment. The endogenous photorespiratory H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production was mimicked by overexpression of glycolate oxidase genes and supplement of substrate glycolate. As expected, seedling establishment was also induced by the endogenously produced H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> under dark condition. These findings also suggest that photorespiratory H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production is at least partially involved in postgermination establishment.
