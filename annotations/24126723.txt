The rhizospheric microbiome is comprised of many microbes, some of which reduce the virulence of their phytopathogenic neighbors; however, the mechanisms underlying these interactions are largely unknown. Rice soil isolate Pseudomonas chlororaphis EA105 strongly inhibits Magnaporthe oryzae's in vitro growth by restricting fungal diameter as well as inhibiting the formation of the appressorium, required for penetration. We were interested in elucidating M. oryzae's response to EA105 treatment, and utilized a microarray approach to obtain a global perspective of EA105 elicited changes in this pathogen. Based on this analysis, three genes of interest were knocked out in M. oryzae 70-15, and their sensitivity to EA105 treatment as well as their ability to infect rice was determined. Priming rice plants with EA105 prior to M. oryzae infection decreased lesion size, and the mutants were tested to see if this effect was retained. A null 70-15 mutant in a trichothecene biosynthesis gene showed less susceptibility to bacterial treatment, forming more appressoria than the parental type 70-15. A similar pattern was seen in a null mutant for a stress-inducible protein, MGG_03098. In addition, when this mutant was inoculated onto the leaves of EA105-primed rice plants, lesions were reduced to a greater extent than in 70-15, implicating the lack of this gene with an increased ISR response in rice. Understanding the global effect of biocontrol bacteria on phytopathogens is a key for developing successful and lasting solutions to crop loss caused by plant diseases and has the potential to greatly increase food supply.
