Mitochondria are organelles within eukaryotic cells that are central to the metabolic processes of cellular respiration and ATP production. However, the evolution of mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) in plants is virtually unknown compared to animal mitogenomes or plant plastids, due to complex structural variation and long stretches of repetitive DNA making accurate genome assembly more challenging. Comparing the structural and sequence differences of organellar genomes within and between sorghum species is an essential step in understanding evolutionary processes such as organellar sequence transfer to the nuclear genome as well as improving agronomic traits in sorghum related to cellular metabolism. Here, we assembled seven sorghum mitochondrial and plastid genomes and resolved reticulated mitogenome structures with multilinked relationships that could be grouped into three structural conformations that differ in the content of repeats and genes by contig. The grouping of these mitogenome structural types reflects the two domestication events for sorghum in east and west Africa. We report seven mitogenomes of sorghum from different cultivars and wild sources. The assembly method used here will be helpful in resolving complex genomic structures in other plant species. Our findings give new insights into the structure of sorghum mitogenomes that provides an important foundation for future research into the improvement of sorghum traits related to cellular respiration, cytonuclear incompatibly, and disease resistance.
