Huang <i>et al</i> (Reports, 5 October 2018, p. 80) report significant increases in forest productivity from monocultures to multispecies mixtures in subtropical China. However, their estimated productivity decrease due to a 10% tree species loss seems high. We propose that including species richness distribution of the study forests would provide more meaningful estimates of forest-scale responses.

Tree Species: !influences! Productivity 
Species Richness: !modulates! Forest-scale Responses
