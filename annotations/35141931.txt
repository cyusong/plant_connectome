Many TGA transcription factors participate in immune responses in the SA-mediated signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. This study identified a transcription factor OsTGAL1, which is induced upon infection by Xoo. Overexpression of OsTGAL1 increased the susceptibility of rice to Xoo. Plants overexpressing OsTGAL1 could affect the expression of many SA signaling-related genes. OsTGAL1 was able to interact with the promoter of OsSGT1, which encodes a key enzyme for SA metabolism. The transcript of OsSGT1 was induced by Xoo and this responsive expression was further increased in plants overexpressing OsTGAL1. OsSGT1 knockout lines had enhanced resistance to Xoo, and knocking out OsSGT1 in plants overexpressing OsTGAL1 blocked the susceptibility caused by OsTGAL1. Altered expression levels of several OsPRs in all the transgenic plants demonstrated that SA-mediated signaling had been affected. Furthermore, we identified an oxidoreductase of CC-type glutaredoxin, OsGRX17, which interacted with OsTGAL1. OsGRX17 reduced the regulation of OsTGAL1 on OsSGT1, and this may be due to its redox modulation. Thus, our results demonstrate that OsTGAL1 negatively regulates resistance to Xoo by its effects on SA metabolism via the activation of OsSGT1, which provides valuable targets for plant breeders in developing new cultivars that are resistant to Xoo.
