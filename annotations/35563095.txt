Quinoa (<i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd.) is a dicotyledonous annual herb of Family Amaranthaceae and Subfamily Chenopodiaceae. It has high nutritional and economic value. Phosphorus (P) is an essential plant macronutrient, a component of many biomolecules, and vital to growth, development, and metabolism. We analyzed the transcriptomes and metabolomes of Dianli-1299 and Dianli-71 quinoa seedlings, compared their phenotypes, and elucidated the mechanisms of their responses to the phosphorus treatments. Phenotypes significantly varied with phosphorus level. The plants responded to changes in available phosphorus by modulating metabolites and genes implicated in glycerophospholipid, glycerolipid and glycolysis, and glyconeogenesis metabolism. We detected 1057 metabolites, of which 149 were differentially expressed (DEMs) and common to the control (CK) vs. the low-phosphorus (LP) treatment samples, while two DEMs were common to CK vs. the high-phosphorus (HP) treatment samples. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) annotated 29,232 genes, of which 231 were differentially expressed (DEGs) and common to CK vs. LP, while one was common to CK vs. HP. A total of 15 DEMs and 11 DEGs might account for the observed differences in the responses of the quinoa seedlings to the various phosphorus levels. The foregoing results may provide a theoretical basis for improving the phosphorus utilization efficiency in quinoa.
