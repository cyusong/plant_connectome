Split-root assays have been used widely in studies focused on understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms in legume-rhizobia symbioses, root nitrogen rhizodeposition, and belowground nitrogen transfer, and the effects of different biotic/abiotic factors on this symbiotic interaction. This assay allows a plant to have a root system that is physically divided into two distinct sections that are both still attached to a common shoot. Thus, each root section can be treated separately to monitor local and systemic plant responses. Different techniques are used to establish split-root assemblies, including double-pot systems, divided growth pouches, elbow root assembly, twin-tube systems, a single pot or chamber with a partition in the center, and divided agar plates. This review is focused on discussing the various types of split-root assays currently used in legume-based studies, and their associated advantages and limitations. Furthermore, this review also focuses on how split-root assays have been used for studies on nitrogen rhizodeposition, belowground nitrogen transfer, systemic regulation of nodulation, and biotic and abiotic factors affecting legume-rhizobia symbioses.
