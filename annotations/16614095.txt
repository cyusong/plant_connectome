H(+)-ATPase, the key enzyme for the energization of ion and nutrient transport across the plasma membrane, is activated by phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3 binding. Since the involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in sugar sensing-regulated processes has recently emerged, here we address the question as to whether sugar sensing plays a role in the regulation of H(+)-ATPase. The data reported here show that sugar depletion inhibits the association of 14-3-3 proteins with H(+)-ATPase by hampering phosphorylation of the 14-3-3 binding site of the enzyme. By using non-metabolizable disaccharides, we show that H(+)-ATPase regulation by 14-3-3 proteins can involve a specific sugar perception and transduction mechanism.
