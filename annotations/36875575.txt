Flavonoids are important secondary metabolites with extensive pharmacological functions. <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> L. (ginkgo) has attracted extensive attention because of its high flavonoid medicinal value. However, little is understood about ginkgo flavonol biosynthesis. Herein, we cloned the full-length gingko <i>GbFLSa</i> gene (1314 bp), which encodes a 363 amino acid protein that has a typical 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-Fe(II) oxygenase region. Recombinant GbFLSa protein with a molecular mass of 41 kDa was expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> BL21(DE3). The protein was localized to the cytoplasm. Moreover, proanthocyanins, including catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin and gallocatechin, were significantly less abundant in transgenic poplar than in nontransgenic (CK) plants. In addition, <i>dihydroflavonol 4-reductase</i>, <i>anthocyanidin synthase</i> and <i>leucoanthocyanidin reductase</i> expression levels were significantly lower than those of their CK counterparts. GbFLSa thus encodes a functional protein that might negatively regulate proanthocyanin biosynthesis. This study helps elucidate the role of GbFLSa in plant metabolism and the potential molecular mechanism of flavonoid biosynthesis.
