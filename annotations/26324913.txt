['26324913', 'Ubiquitination is a signal for various cellular processes, including for  endocytic degradation of plasma membrane cargos. Ubiquitinating as well as  deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) can regulate these processes by modifying the  ubiquitination status of target protein. Although accumulating evidence points to  the important regulatory role of DUBs, the molecular basis of their regulation is  still not well understood. Associated molecule with the SH3 domain of signal  transduction adaptor molecule (STAM) (AMSH) is a conserved metalloprotease DUB in  eukaryotes. AMSH proteins interact with components of the endosomal sorting  complex required for transport (ESCRT) and are implicated in intracellular  trafficking. To investigate how the function of AMSH is regulated at the cellular  level, we carried out an interaction screen for the Arabidopsis AMSH proteins and  identified the Arabidopsis homolog of apoptosis-linked gene-2 interacting protein  X (ALIX) as a protein interacting with AMSH3 in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of  alix knockout mutants in Arabidopsis showed that ALIX is essential for plant  growth and development and that ALIX is important for the biogenesis of the  vacuole and multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Cell biological analysis revealed that  ALIX and AMSH3 colocalize on late endosomes. Although ALIX did not stimulate  AMSH3 activity in vitro, in the absence of ALIX, AMSH3 localization on endosomes  was abolished. Taken together, our data indicate that ALIX could function as an  important regulator for AMSH3 function at the late endosomes.', '2015 Oct 6', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1510516112', 'Isono']
