Epigeal germination of a dicot, like lupin (Lupinus albus L.), produces a seedling with a characteristic hypocotyl, which grows in darkness showing a steep growth gradient with an elongation zone just below the apex. The role of phytohormones, such as auxin and ethylene, in etiolated hypocotyl growth has been the object of our research for some time. The recent cloning and expression of three genes of influx and efflux carriers for polar auxin transport (LaAUX1, LaPIN1 and LaPIN3) reinforces a previous model proposed to explain the accumulation of auxin in the upper growth zone of the hypocotyl.

LaPIN1: !affects! Hypocotyl growth
LaPIN3: !affects! Hypocotyl growth
Auxin: !affects! Hypocotyl growth
Ethylene: !affects! Hypocotyl growth
LaAUX1: !transports! Auxin
LaPIN1: !transports! Auxin
LaPIN3: !transports! Auxin
