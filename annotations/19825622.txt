Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are continuously produced as a result of aerobic metabolism or in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. ROS are not only toxic by-products of aerobic metabolism, but are also signaling molecules involved in plant growth and environmental adaptation. Antioxidants can protect the cell from oxidative damage by scavenging the ROS. Thus, they play an important role in optimizing cell function by regulating cellular redox state and modifying gene expression. This article aims to review recent studies highlighting the role of redox signals in establishing and maintaining symbiosis between rhizobia and legumes.
