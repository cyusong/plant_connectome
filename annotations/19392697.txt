['19392697', 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling networks are important  regulators of environmental responses and developmental processes in plants. To  understand the role of MAPK signalling modules in the regulation of plant  microtubule functions, we searched for MAPKs that interact with the  dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase, PROPYZAMIDE HYPERSENSITIVE 1 (PHS1), whose  mutation has previously been reported to confer hypersensitivity to  microtubule-disrupting drugs in Arabidopsis. Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated  that PHS1 specifically interacts with two MAPKs, MPK12 and MPK18. Bimolecular  fluorescence complementation (BiFC) studies confirmed that the PHS1 and MPK18  proteins are physically coupled, and that this interaction occurs in the  cytoplasm. At the biochemical level, in vitro dephosphorylation assays indicated  that phospho-MPK18 can be dephosphorylated by recombinant PHS1. Mutant mpk18  seedlings show defects in microtubule-related functions, and have moderately  stabilized microtubules. Absence of MPK18 in the phs1-1 background partially  complements the phs1-1 root growth phenotypes, providing genetic evidence for  involvement of MPK18 signalling in microtubule-related functions. We propose a  model whereby the PHS1-MPK18 signalling module is involved in a  phosphorylation/dephosphorylation switch that regulates cortical microtubule  functions.', '2009 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03895.x', 'Ellis']
