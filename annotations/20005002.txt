The leaf proteome of 3-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings exposed for 1 week to low, environmentally realistic Cd concentrations was investigated. The data indicated that at 1muMCd, A. thaliana plants adapted their metabolism to cope with the Cd exposure. As a result, only moderate protein changes were observed. However, at 10muMCd, severe stress was indicated by growth reduction and chlorosis of rosette leaves at the macroscopic level and by lipid peroxidation and enhanced peroxidase activity at the cellular level. Of the 730 reproducible proteins among all gels, 21 were statistically upregulated in response to Cd. These proteins can be functionally grouped into 5 classes: proteins involved in (1) oxidative stress response, (2) photosynthesis and energy production, (3) protein metabolism, (4) gene expression and finally, (5) proteins with various or unknown function. In order to provide greater insight into the mechanisms induced on Cd exposure, a working model is proposed.
