RNA silencing is a common antiviral mechanism in eukaryotic organisms. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism that controls the RNA silencing process remains elusive. Here, we performed high-depth transcriptome analysis on petunia (<i>Petunia hybrida</i>) leaves infected with tobacco rattle virus (TRV) strain PPK20. A total of 7,402 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Of them, some RNA silencing-related transcripts, such as <i>RNA-dependent RNA polymerases</i> (<i>RDR</i>s), <i>Dicer-like RNase III enzymes</i> (<i>DCL</i>s), and <i>Argonautes</i> (<i>AGO</i>s), were induced by viral attack. Furthermore, we performed TRV-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay on 39 DEGs encoding putative transcription factors (TFs), using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and <i>phytoene desaturase</i> (<i>PhPDS</i>) as reporters. Results showed that the down-regulation of <i>PhbHLH41</i>, <i>PhbHLH93</i>, <i>PhZPT4-3</i>, <i>PhCOL4</i>, <i>PhHSF</i>-<i>B3A</i>, <i>PhNAC90</i>, and <i>PhWRKY75</i> led to enhanced TRV accumulation and inhibited <i>PhPDS</i>-silenced photobleaching phenotype. In contrast, silencing of <i>PhERF22</i> repressed virus accumulation and promoted photobleaching development. Thus, these TFs were identified as potential positive and negative regulators of antiviral RNA silencing, respectively. One positive regulator <i>PhCOL4</i>, belonging to the B-box zinc finger family, was selected for further functional characterization. Silencing and transient overexpression of <i>PhCOL4</i> resulted in decreased and increased expression of several RNA silencing-related genes. DNA affinity purification sequencing analysis revealed that PhCOL4 targeted <i>PhRDR6</i> and <i>PhAGO4</i>. Dual luciferase and yeast one-hybrid assays determined the binding of PhCOL4 to the <i>PhRDR6</i> and <i>PhAGO4</i> promoters. Our findings suggest that TRV-GFP-<i>PhPDS</i>-based VIGS could be helpful to identify transcriptional regulators of antiviral RNA silencing.
