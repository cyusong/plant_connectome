As the core regulation network for the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway, the PYL-PP2C-SnRK2s family commonly exists in many species. For this study, a total of 9 BsPYLs, 66 BsPP2Cs, and 7 BsSnRK2s genes were identified based on the genomic databases of <i>Bletilla striata</i>, which were classified into 3, 10, and 3 subgroups, respectively. Basic bioinformatics analysis completed, including the physicochemical properties of proteins, gene structures, protein motifs and conserved domains. Multiple <i>cis</i>-acting elements related to stress responses and plant growth were found in promoter regions. Further, 73 genes were localized on 16 pseudochromosomes and 29 pairs of paralogous genes were found via intraspecific collinearity analysis. Furthermore, tissue-specific expression was found in different tissues and germination stages. There were two <i>BsPYLs</i>, 10 <i>BsPP2Cs</i>, and four <i>BsSnRK2</i> genes that exhibited a difference in response to multiple abiotic stresses. Moreover, subcellular localization analysis revealed six important proteins BsPP2C22, BsPP2C38, BsPP2C64, BsPYL2, BsPYL8, and BsSnRK2.4 which were localized in the nucleus and plasma membrane. Finally, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays suggested that BsPP2C22 and BsPP2C38 could interact with multiple BsPYLs and BsSnRK2s proteins. This study systematically reported on the identification and characterization of the PYL-PP2C-SnRK2s family in <i>B. striata</i>, which provided a conceptual basis for deep insights into the functionality of ABA core signal pathways in Orchidaceae.
