The chloroplast thylakoid network is a dynamic structure which, through possible rearrangements, plays a crucial role in regulation of photosynthesis. Although the importance of the main components of the thylakoid membrane matrix, galactolipids, in the formation of the network of internal plastid membrane was found before, the structural role of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosylidacylglycerol (DGDG) is still largely unknown. We elucidated detailed structural modifications of the thylakoid membrane system in Arabidopsis thaliana MGDG- and DGDG-deficient mutants. An altered MGDG/DGDG ratio was structurally reflected by formation of smaller grana, local changes in grana stacking repeat distance, and significant changes in the spatial organization of the thylakoid network compared with wild-type plants. The decrease of the MGDG level impaired the formation of the typical helical grana structure and resulted in a 'helical-dichotomic' arrangement. DGDG deficiency did not affect spatial grana organization but changed the shape of the thylakoid membrane network in situ from lens like into a flattened shape. Such structural disturbances were accompanied by altered composition of carotenoid and chlorophyll-protein complexes, which eventually led to the decreased photosynthetic efficiency of MGDG- and DGDG-deficient plants.
