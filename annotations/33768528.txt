Hybrid seed inviability (HSI) is an important mechanism of reproductive isolation and speciation. HSI varies in strength among populations of diploid species but it remains to be tested whether similar processes affect natural variation in HSI within ploidy-variable species (triploid block). Here we used extensive endosperm, seed and F<sub>1</sub> -hybrid phenotyping to explore HSI variation within a diploid-autotetraploid species. By leveraging 12 population pairs from three ploidy contact zones, we tested for the effect of interploidy crossing direction (parent of origin), ploidy divergence and spatial arrangement in shaping reproductive barriers in a naturally relevant context. We detected strong parent-of-origin effects on endosperm development, F<sub>1</sub> germination and survival, which was also reflected in the rates of triploid formation in the field. Endosperm cellularization failure was least severe and F<sub>1</sub> -hybrid performance was slightly better in the primary contact zone, with genetically closest diploid and tetraploid lineages. We demonstrated overall strong parent-of-origin effects on HSI in a ploidy variable species, which translate to fitness effects and contribute to interploidy reproductive isolation in a natural context. Subtle intraspecific variation in these traits suggests the fitness consequences of HSI are predominantly a constitutive property of the species regardless of the evolutionary background of its populations.
