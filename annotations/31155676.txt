Plants have developed sophisticated mechanisms to compensate and respond to ever-changing environmental conditions. Research focus in this area has recently shifted towards understanding the post-transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to RNA transcript maturation, abundance and function as key regulatory steps in allowing plants to properly react and adapt to these never-ending shifts in their environments. At the center of these regulatory mechanisms are RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), the functional mediators of all post-transcriptional processes. In plants, RBPs are becoming increasingly appreciated as the critical modulators of core cellular processes during development and in response to environmental stimuli. With the majority of research on RBPs and their functions historically in prokaryotic and mammalian systems, it has more recently been unveiled that plants have expanded families of conserved and novel RBPs compared with their eukaryotic counterparts. To better understand the scope of RBPs in plants, we present past and current literature detailing specific roles of RBPs during stress response, development and other fundamental transition periods. In this review, we highlight examples of complex regulation coordinated by RBPs with a focus on the diverse mechanisms of plant RBPs and the unique processes they regulate. Additionally, we discuss the importance for additional research into understanding global interactions of RBPs on a systems and network-scale, with genome mining and annotation providing valuable insight for potential uses in improving crop plants in order to maintain high-level production in this era of global climate change.
