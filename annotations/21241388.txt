['21241388', 'Actin microfilament (MF) organization and remodelling is critical to cell  function. The formin family of actin binding proteins are involved in nucleating  MFs in Arabidopsis thaliana. They all contain formin homology domains in the  intracellular, C-terminal half of the protein that interacts with MFs. Formins in  class I are usually targeted to the plasma membrane and this is true of Formin1  (AtFH1) of A. thaliana. In this study, we have investigated the extracellular  domain of AtFH1 and we demonstrate that AtFH1 forms a bridge from the actin  cytoskeleton, across the plasma membrane and is anchored within the cell wall.  AtFH1 has a large, extracellular domain that is maintained by purifying selection  and that contains four conserved regions, one of which is responsible for  immobilising the protein. Protein anchoring within the cell wall is reduced in  constructs that express truncations of the extracellular domain and in  experiments in protoplasts without primary cell walls. The 18 amino acid  proline-rich extracellular domain that is responsible for AtFH1 anchoring has  homology with cell-wall extensins. We also have shown that anchoring of AtFH1 in  the cell wall promotes actin bundling within the cell and that overexpression of  AtFH1 has an inhibitory effect on organelle actin-dependant dynamics. Thus, the  AtFH1 bridge provides stable anchor points for the actin cytoskeleton and is  probably a crucial component of the signalling response and actin-remodelling  mechanisms.', '2011 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04497.x', 'Runions']
