In general, leaves are (13) C-depleted compared with all other organs (e.g. roots, stem/trunk and fruits). Different hypotheses are formulated in the literature to explain this difference. One of these states that CO2 respired by leaves in the dark is (13) C-enriched compared with leaf organic matter, while it is (13) C-depleted in the case of root respiration. The opposite respiratory fractionation between leaves and roots was invoked as an explanation for the widespread between-organ isotopic differences. After summarizing the basics of photosynthetic and post-photosynthetic discrimination, we mainly review the recent findings on the isotopic composition of CO2 respired by leaves (autotrophic organs) and roots (heterotrophic organs) compared with respective plant material (i.e. apparent respiratory fractionation) as well as its metabolic origin. The potential impact of such fractionation on the isotopic signal of organic matter (OM) is discussed. Some perspectives for future studies are also proposed .
