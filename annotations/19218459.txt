['19218459', 'Cell-to-cell transport in plants occurs through cytoplasmic channels called  "plasmodesmata" and is regulated by developmental and environmental factors.  Callose deposition modulates plasmodesmal transport in vivo, but little is known  about the mechanisms that regulate this process. Here we report a genetic  approach to identify mutants affecting plasmodesmal transport. We isolated 5  mutants, named gfp arrested trafficking (gat), affected in GFP unloading from the  phloem into the meristem. gat1 mutants were seedling lethal and carried lesions  in an m-type thioredoxin that is expressed in non-green plastids of meristems and  organ primordia. Callose and hydrogen peroxide accumulated in gat1 mutants, and  WT plants subjected to oxidative conditions phenocopied the gat1 trafficking  defects. Ectopic expression of GAT1 in mature leaves increased plasmodesmal  permeability and led to a delay in senescence and flowering time. We propose a  role for the GAT1 thioredoxin in the redox regulation of callose deposition and  symplastic permeability that is essential for meristem maintenance in  Arabidopsis.', '2009 Mar 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0808717106', 'Jackson']
