Root-to-shoot signalling via xylem sap is an important mechanism by which plants respond to stress. This signalling could be mediated by alteration in the concentrations of inorganic and/or organic molecules. The effect of salt stress on the contents of xylem sap in Brassica olarecea has been analysed by mass spectrometry in order to quantify these changes. Subcellular location of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) by immunogold labelling and peroxidase isozymes was also analysed by isoelectrofocusing. The xylem sap metabolome analysis demonstrated the presence of many organic compounds such as sugars, organic acids and amino acids. Of these, amino acid concentrations, particularly that of glutamine, the major amino acid in the sap, were substantially reduced by salt stress. The xylem sap proteome analysis demonstrated the accumulation of enzymes involved in xylem differentiation and lignification, such as cystein proteinases, acid peroxidases, and a putative hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase under salt stress. The peroxidase isozyme pattern showed that salt stress induced a high accumulation of an acid isoform. These results suggest that xylem differentiation and lignification is induced by salt stress. The combination of different methods to analyse the xylem sap composition provides new insights into mechanisms in plant development and signalling under salt stress.
