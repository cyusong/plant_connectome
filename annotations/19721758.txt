Recently we have suggested that (glucurono)arabinoxylans [(G)AX] feruloylation and oxidative coupling occur both intra-protoplasmically and, extra-protoplasmically, in the plant cell wall. In this work we illustrate a model of two possible mechanisms of polysaccharide feruloylation and oxidative coupling in plants. Moreover, we take into consideration the possible role of in muro feruloylation as a rapid defense mechanism against potential plant pathogen and parasite infections.
