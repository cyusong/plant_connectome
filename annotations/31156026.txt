Salinity is a major abiotic stressor that limits the growth, development, and reproduction of plants. Our previous metabolic analysis of high salt-adapted callus suspension cell cultures from <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots indicated that physical reinforcement of the cell wall is an important step in adaptation to saline conditions. Compared to normal cells, salt-adapted cells exhibit an increased lignin content and thickened cell wall. In this study, we investigated not only the lignin biosynthesis gene expression patterns in salt-adapted cells, but also the effects of a loss-of-function of CCoAOMT1, which plays a critical role in the lignin biosynthesis pathway, on plant responses to high-salt stress. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed higher mRNA levels of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis, including <i>CCoAOMT1, 4CL1, 4CL2, COMT, PAL1, PAL2</i>, and <i>AtPrx52</i>, in salt-adapted cells relative to normal cells, which suggests activation of the lignin biosynthesis pathway in salt-adapted cells. Moreover, plants harboring the <i>CCoAOMT1</i> mutants, <i>ccoaomt1-1</i> and <i>ccoaomt1-2</i>, were phenotypically hypersensitive to salt stress. Our study has provided molecular and genetic evidence indicating the importance of enhanced lignin accumulation in the plant cell wall during the responses to salt stress.
