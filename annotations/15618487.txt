['15618487', 'The position-dependent specification of root epidermal cells in Arabidopsis  provides an elegant paradigm for cell patterning during development. Here, we  describe a new gene, SCRAMBLED (SCM), required for cells to appropriately  interpret their location within the developing root epidermis. SCM encodes a  receptor-like kinase protein with a predicted extracellular domain of six  leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular serine-threonine kinase domain. SCM  regulates the expression of the GLABRA2, CAPRICE, WEREWOLF, and ENHANCER OF  GLABRA3 transcription factor genes that define the cell fates. Further, the SCM  gene is expressed throughout the developing root. Therefore, SCM likely enables  developing epidermal cells to detect positional cues and establish an appropriate  cell-type pattern.', '2005 Feb 18', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1105373', 'Schiefelbein']
