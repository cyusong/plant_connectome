A group of MADS transcription factors (TFs) are believed to control temperature-mediated bud dormancy. These TFs, called DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM), are encoded by genes similar to SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) from Arabidopsis. MADS proteins form transcriptional complexes whose combinatory composition defines their molecular function. However, how MADS multimeric complexes control the dormancy cycle in trees is unclear. Apple MdDAM and other dormancy-related MADS proteins form complexes with MdSVPa, which is essential for the ability of transcriptional complexes to bind to DNA. Sequential DNA-affinity purification sequencing (seq-DAP-seq) was performed to identify the genome-wide binding sites of apple MADS TF complexes. Target genes associated with the binding sites were identified by combining seq-DAP-seq data with transcriptomics datasets obtained using a glucocorticoid receptor fusion system, and RNA-seq data related to apple dormancy. We describe a gene regulatory network (GRN) formed by MdSVPa-containing complexes, which regulate the dormancy cycle in response to environmental cues and hormonal signaling pathways. Additionally, novel molecular evidence regarding the evolutionary functional segregation between DAM and SVP proteins in the Rosaceae is presented. MdSVPa sequentially forms complexes with the MADS TFs that predominate at each dormancy phase, altering its DNA-binding specificity and, therefore, the transcriptional regulation of its target genes.
