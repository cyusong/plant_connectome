Newer effectorome prediction algorithms are considering effectors that may not comply with the canonical characteristics of small, secreted, cysteine-rich proteins. The use of effector-related motifs and domains is an emerging strategy for effector identification, but its use has been limited to individual species, whether oomycete or fungal, and certain domains and motifs have only been associated with one or the other. The use of these strategies is important for the identification of novel, non-canonical effectors (NCEs) which we have found to constitute approximately 90% of the effectoromes. We produced an algorithm in Bash called WideEffHunter that is founded on integrating three key characteristics: the presence of effector motifs, effector domains and homology to validated existing effectors. Interestingly, we found similar numbers of effectors with motifs and domains within two different taxonomic kingdoms: fungi and oomycetes, indicating that with respect to their effector content, the two organisms may be more similar than previously believed. WideEffHunter can identify the entire effectorome (non-canonical and canonical effectors) of oomycetes and fungi whether pathogenic or non-pathogenic, unifying effector prediction in these two kingdoms as well as the two different lifestyles. The elucidation of complete effectoromes is a crucial step towards advancing effectoromics and disease management in agriculture.
