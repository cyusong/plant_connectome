Plant cells are able to convey positional and developmental information between cells through the direct transfer of transcription factors. One well studied example of this is the SHORT-ROOT (SHR) protein, which moves from the stele into the neighboring ground tissue layer to specify endodermis. While it has been shown that SHR trafficking relies on plasmodesmata (PD), and interaction with the SHR INTERACTING EMBRYONIC LETHAL (SIEL) protein, little information is known about how SHR trafficking is controlled or how SIEL promotes the movement of SHR. Here we show that SHR can move from multiple different cell types in the root. Analysis of subcellular localization indicates that in the cytoplasm of root or leaf cells, SHR localizes to endosomes in a SIEL-dependent manner. Interference of early and late endosomes disrupts intercellular movement of SHR. Our findings reveal an essential role for the plant endomembrane, independent of secretion, in the intercellular trafficking of SHR.
