In Arabidopsis thaliana, the endosomal-localized Na+/H+ antiporters NHX5 and NHX6 regulate ion and pH homeostasis and are important for plant growth and development. However, the mechanism by which these endosomal NHXs function in plant development is not well understood. Auxin modulates plant growth and development through the formation of concentration gradients in plant tissue to control cell division and expansion. Here, we identified a role for NHX5 and NHX6 in the establishment and maintenance of auxin gradients in embryo and root tissues. We observed developmental impairment and abnormal cell division in embryo and root tissues in the double knockout nhx5 nhx6, consistent with these tissues showing high expression of NHX5 and NHX6. Through confocal microscopy imaging with the DR5::GFP auxin reporter, we identify defects in the perception, accumulation and redistribution of auxin in nhx5 nhx6 cells. Furthermore, we find that the steady-state levels of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers PIN1 and PIN2 are reduced in nhx5 nhx6 root cells. Our results demonstrate that NHX5 and NHX6 function in auxin-mediated plant development by maintaining PIN abundance at the plasma membrane, and provide new insight into the regulation of plant development by endosomal NHX antiporters.
