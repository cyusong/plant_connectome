['35417008', 'The homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex is a conserved,  multi-subunit tethering complex in eukaryotic cells. In yeast and mammalian  cells, the HOPS subunit vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 41 (VPS41) is  recruited to late endosomes after Ras-related protein 7 (Rab7) activation and is  essential for vacuole fusion. However, whether VPS41 plays conserved roles in  plants is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that in the model plant Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana), VPS41 localizes to distinct condensates in root cells in  addition to its reported localization at the tonoplast. The formation of  condensates does not rely on the known upstream regulators but depends on VPS41  self-interaction and is essential for vegetative growth regulation. Genetic  evidence indicates that VPS41 is required for both homotypic vacuole fusion and  cargo sorting from the adaptor protein complex 3, Rab5, and Golgi-independent  pathways but is dispensable for the Rab7 cargo inositol transporter 1. We also  show that VPS41 has HOPS-independent functions in vacuolar transport. Taken  together, our findings indicate that Arabidopsis VPS41 is a unique subunit of the  HOPS complex that carries out plant-specific roles in both vacuolar transport and  developmental regulation.', '2022 Jun 27', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiac167', 'ORCID:']
