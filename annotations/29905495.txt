OxyR and SoxR are two transcriptional regulators in response to oxidative stress in most bacteria, and SoxR has been reported to be activated by the endogenous redox-cycling compound phenazine in phenazine-producing organisms. However, which transcriptional regulator is activated in pathogens treated with the antibiotic phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) has not been determined. In this study, we found that PCA treatment activated OxyR rather than SoxR in the phytopathogenic bacteria Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. We also found that X. oryzae pv. oryzae was much more sensitive to PCA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and had a defective antioxidant system (i.e., less of total antioxidant capacity and total catalase activity than X. oryzae pv. oryzicola, although X. oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola are very closely related). Based on KEGG sequences, OxyR differs in 10 amino acids in X. oryzae pv. oryzae versus X. oryzae pv. oryzicola. By exchanging OxyR between X. oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola, we elucidated that OxyR contributed to the differences in antioxidant capacity, total catalase activity, and sensitivity to PCA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We also found that OxyR affected X. oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola growth in a nutrient-poor medium, virulence on host plants (rice), and the hypersensitive response on nonhost plants (Nicotiana benthamiana). Thus, OxyR is a critical regulator that relates to the differences in antioxidative stress between X. oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola and contributes to the differences in survival of them against oxidative stress.
