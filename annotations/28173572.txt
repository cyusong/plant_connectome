The Mediator complex is a large, multisubunit, transcription co-regulator that is conserved across eukaryotes. Studies of the Arabidopsis Mediator complex and its subunits have shown that it functions in nearly every aspect of plant development and fitness. In addition to revealing mechanisms of regulation of plant-specific pathways, studies of plant Mediator complexes have the potential to shed light on the conservation and divergence of Mediator structure and function across Kingdoms and plant lineages. The majority of insights into plant Mediator function have come from Arabidopsis because it is the only plant from which Mediator has been purified and from which an array of Mediator mutants have been isolated by forward and reverse genetics. So far, these studies indicate that, despite low sequence similarity between many orthologous subunits, the overall structure and function of Mediator is well conserved between Kingdoms. Several studies have also expanded our knowledge of Mediator to other plant species, opening avenues of investigation into the role of Mediator in plant adaptation and fitness.
