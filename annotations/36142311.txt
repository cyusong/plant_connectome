Heterophylly, the phenomenon by which plants alter leaf forms to adapt to surrounding conditions, is apparent in amphibious plant species. In response to submergence, they emerge leaves with narrower blade areas. The pathway that receives the submergence signals and the mechanism regulating leaf form via cell proliferation and/or expansion systems have not yet been fully identified yet. Our anatomical study of <i>Rorippa aquatica</i>, an amphibious plant that exhibits heterophylly in response to various signals, showed that leaf thickness increased upon submergence; this was caused by the expansion of mesophyll cell size. Additionally, these submergence effects were inhibited under blue-light conditions. The <i>ANGUSTIFOLIA3</i> (<i>AN3</i>)/<i>GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR</i> (<i>GRF</i>) pathway regulating cell proliferation and cell expansion was downregulated in response to submergence; and the response was blocked under the blue-light conditions. These results suggest that submergence and light quality determine leaf cell morphology via the AN3/GRF pathway.
