['17319842', 'Guard cells respond to light through two independent signalling pathways. The  first pathway is initiated by photosynthetically active radiation and has been  associated with changes in the intercellular CO(2) concentration, leading to  inhibition of plasma membrane anion channels. The second response is  blue-light-specific and so far has been restricted to the activation of plasma  membrane H(+)-ATPases. In a search for interactions of both signalling pathways,  guard cells of Vicia faba and Arabidopsis thaliana were studied in intact plants.  Vicia faba guard cells recorded in CO(2)-free air responded to blue light with a  transient outward plasma membrane current that had an average peak value of 17  pA. In line with previous reports, changes in the current-voltage relation of the  plasma membrane indicate that this outward current is based on the activation of  H(+)-ATPases. However, when V. faba guard cells were blue-light-stimulated in air  with 700 microl l(-1) CO(2), the outward current increased to 56 pA. The increase  in current was linked to inhibition of S-type anion channels. Blue light also  inhibited plasma membrane anion channels in A. thaliana guard cells, but not in  the phot1 phot2 double mutant. These results show that blue light inhibits plasma  membrane anion channels through a pathway involving phototropins, in addition to  the stimulation of guard cell plasma membrane H(+)-ATPases.', '2007 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.03026.x', 'Roelfsema']
