<i>Peronophythora litchii</i> is an oomycete pathogen that exclusively infects litchi, with infection stages affecting a broad range of tissues. In this study, we obtained a near chromosome-level genome assembly of <i>P. litchii</i> ZL2018 from China using Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing and Illumina short-read sequencing. The genome assembly was 64.15 Mb in size and consisted of 81 contigs with an N<sub>50</sub> of 1.43 Mb and a maximum length of 4.74 Mb. Excluding 34.67% of repeat sequences, 14,857 protein-coding genes were identified, among which 14,447 genes were annotated. We also predicted 306 candidate RxLR effectors in the assembly. The high-quality genome assembly and annotation resources reported in this study will provide new insight into the infection mechanisms of <i>P. litchii</i>.[Formula: see text] The author(s) have dedicated the work to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 "No Rights Reserved" license by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. 2021.
