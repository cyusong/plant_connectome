Acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicides (group 2) have been widely applied for the last 20 years to control <i>Sinapis alba</i> in cereal crops from southern Spain. In 2008, a tribenuron-methyl (TM) resistant (R) <i>S. alba</i> population was first reported in a cereal field in Malaga (southern Spain). In 2018, three suspected R <i>S. alba</i> populations (R1, R2 and R3) to TM were collected from three different fields in Granada (southern Spain, 100 km away from Malaga). The present work aims to confirm the putative resistance of these populations to TM and explore their resistance mechanisms. Dose-response assays showed that the R1, R2 and R3 populations ranging between 57.4, 44.4 and 57.1 times more resistance to TM than the susceptible population (S). A mutation in the <i>ALS</i> gene (Asp376Glu) was detected in the Rs <i>S. alba</i> populations. <sup>14</sup>C-metabolism studies show that metabolites and TM were changing significantly faster in the R than in the S plants. Alternative chemical control trials showed that 2,4-D and MCPA (auxin mimics), glyphosate (enolpyruvyl shikimate phosphate synthase,EPSPS, inhibitor-group 9), metribuzin (PSII inhibitors/Serine 264 Binders, -group 5) and mesotrione (hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase, HPPD, inhibitor-group 27) presented a high control of the four populations of <i>S. alba</i> tested, both S and R. Based on these results, it is the first case described where the Asp376Glu mutation and P450-mediated metabolism participates in resistance to TM in <i>S. alba</i>. Comparing these results with those found in the <i>S. alba</i> population in Malaga in 2008, where the resistance was TSR type (Pro197Ser), we can suggest that despite the geographical proximity (over 100 km), the resistance in these cases was due to different evolutionary events.
