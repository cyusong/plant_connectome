Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential element for almost all living organisms. After being taken up into the cells as molybdate, it is incorporated into the molybdenum cofactor, which functions as the active site of several molybdenum-requiring enzymes and thus plays crucial roles in multiple biological processes. The uptake and transport of molybdate is mainly mediated by two types of molybdate transporters. The homeostasis of Mo in plant cells is tightly controlled, and such homeostasis likely plays vital roles in plant adaptation to local environments. Recent evidence suggests that Mo is more than an essential element required for plant growth and development; it is also involved in local adaptation to coastal salinity. In this review, we summarize recent research progress on molybdate uptake and transport, molybdenum homeostasis network in plants, and discuss the potential roles of the molybdate transporter in plant adaptation to their local environment.
