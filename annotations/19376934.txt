['19376934', 'Chloroplasts of photosynthetic organisms harness light energy and convert it into  chemical energy. In several land plants, GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors  are required for chloroplast development, as glk1 glk2 double mutants are pale  green and deficient in the formation of the photosynthetic apparatus. We show  here that glk1 glk2 double mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana accumulate abnormal  levels of chlorophyll precursors and that constitutive GLK gene expression leads  to increased accumulation of transcripts for antenna proteins and chlorophyll  biosynthetic enzymes. To establish the primary targets of GLK gene action, an  inducible expression system was used in combination with transcriptome analysis.  Following induction, transcript pools were substantially enriched in genes  involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, light harvesting, and electron transport.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the direct association of  GLK1 protein with target gene promoters, revealing a putative regulatory  cis-element. We show that GLK proteins influence photosynthetic gene expression  independently of the phyB signaling pathway and that the two GLK genes are  differentially responsive to plastid retrograde signals. These results suggest  that GLK genes help to coregulate and synchronize the expression of a suite of  nuclear photosynthetic genes and thus act to optimize photosynthetic capacity in  varying environmental and developmental conditions.', '2009 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.065250', 'Langdale']
