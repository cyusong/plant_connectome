Successful germination and seedling development are crucial steps in the growth of a new plant. In this study, we investigated the course of the cell cycle during germination in relation to grain hydration in the model grass <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> (Brachypodium) for the first time. Flow cytometry was performed to monitor the cell cycle progression during germination and to estimate DNA content in embryo tissues. The analyses of whole zygotic embryos revealed that the relative DNA content was 2C, 4C, 8C, and 16C. Endoreplicated nuclei were detected in the scutellum and coleorhiza cells, whereas the rest of the embryo tissues only had nuclei with a 2C and 4C DNA content. This study was accompanied by a spatiotemporal profile analysis of the DNA synthetic activity in the organs of Brachypodium embryos during germination using EdU labelling. Upon imbibition, nuclear DNA replication was initiated in the radicle within 11 h and subsequently spread towards the plumule. The first EdU-labelled prophases were observed after 14 h of imbibition. Analysis of selected genes that are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, such as those encoding cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclins, demonstrated an increase in their expression profiles.
