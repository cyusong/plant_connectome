In plants, the phloem distributes photosynthetic products for metabolism and storage over long distances. It relies on specialized cells, the sieve elements, which are enucleated and interconnected through large so-called sieve pores in their adjoining cell walls. Reverse genetics identified PECTATE LYASE-LIKE 12 (PLL12) as critical for plant growth and development. Using genetic complementations, we established that PLL12 is required exclusively late during sieve element differentiation. Structural homology modeling, enzyme inactivation, and overexpression suggest a vital role for PLL12 in sieve-element-specific pectin remodeling. While short distance symplastic diffusion is unaffected, the pll12 mutant is unable to accommodate sustained plant development due to an incapacity to accommodate increasing hydraulic demands on phloem long-distance transport as the plant grows-a defect that is aggravated when combined with another sieve-element-specific mutant callose synthase 7 (cals7). Establishing CALS7 as a specific sieve pore marker, we investigated the subcellular dynamics of callose deposition in the developing sieve plate. Using fluorescent CALS7 then allowed identifying structural defects in pll12 sieve pores that are moderate at the cellular level but become physiologically relevant due to the serial arrangement of sieve elements in the sieve tube. Overall, pectin degradation through PLL12 appears subtle in quantitative terms. We therefore speculate that PLL12 may act as a regulator to locally remove homogalacturonan, thus potentially enabling further extracellular enzymes to access and modify the cell wall during sieve pore maturation.
