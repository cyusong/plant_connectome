As a drastic environmental change, metal pollution may promote the rapid evolution of genetic adaptations contributing to metal tolerance. In Arabidopsis halleri, genetic bases of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) tolerance have been uncovered only in a metallicolous accession, although tolerance is species-wide. The genetic determinants of Zn and Cd tolerance in a nonmetallicolous accession were thus investigated for the first time. The genetic architecture of tolerance was investigated in a nonmetallicolous population (SK2) by using first backcross progeny obtained from crosses between SK2 and Arabidopsis lyrata petraea, a nonmetallophyte species. Only one significant and common quantitative trait locus (QTL) region was identified explaining 22.6% and 31.2% of the phenotypic variation for Zn and Cd tolerance, respectively. This QTL co-localized with HEAVY METAL ATPASE 4 (AhHMA4), which was previously validated as a determinant of Zn and Cd tolerance in a metallicolous accession. Triplication and high expression of HMA4 were confirmed in SK2. In contrast, gene duplication and high expression of METAL TOLERANT PROTEIN 1A (MTP1A), which was previously associated with Zn tolerance in a metallicolous accession, were not observed in SK2. Overall, the results support the role of HMA4 in tolerance capacities of A. halleri that may have pre-existed in nonmetallicolous populations before colonization of metal-polluted habitats. Preadaptation to metal-contaminated sites is thus discussed.
