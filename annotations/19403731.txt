['19403731', "Regulation of gene expression through translational control is common in many  organisms. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transcription factor bZIP11 is  translational repressed in response to sucrose (Suc), resulting in Suc-regulated  changes in amino acid metabolism. The 5' leader of the bZIP11 mRNA harbors  several upstream open reading frames (uORFs), of which the second uORF is well  conserved among bZIP11 homologous genes. The uORF2 element encodes a Suc control  peptide (SC-peptide) of 28 residues that is sufficient for imposing Suc-induced  repression of translation (SIRT) on a heterologous mRNA. Detailed analysis of the  SC-peptide suggests that it functions as an attenuator peptide. Results suggest  that the SC-peptide inhibits bZIP11 translation in response to high Suc levels by  stalling the ribosome on the mRNA. The conserved noncanonical AUG contexts of  bZIP11 uORFs allow inefficient translational initiation of the uORF, resulting in  translation initiation of the scanning ribosome at the AUG codon of the bZIP11  main ORF. The results presented show that Suc-dependent signaling mediates  differential translation of mRNAs containing SC-peptides encoding uORFs.", '2009 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.136036', 'Hanson']
