Broomcorn millet (<i>Panicum miliaceum</i> L.) is a water-efficient and highly salt-tolerant plant. In this study, the salt tolerance of 17 local species of broomcorn millet was evaluated through testing based on the analysis of the whitening time and the germination rate of their seeds. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that <i>PmbZIP131</i>, <i>PmbZIP125</i>, <i>PmbZIP33</i>, <i>PmABI5</i>, <i>PmbZIP118</i>, and <i>PmbZIP97</i> are involved in seed germination under salt stress. Seedling stage expression analysis indicates that <i>PmABI5</i> expression was induced by treatments of high salt (200 mM NaCl), drought (20% W/V PEG6000), and low temperature (4 °C) in seedlings of the salt-tolerant variety Y9. The overexpression of <i>PmABI5</i> significantly increases the germination rate and root traits of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> transgenic lines, with root growth and grain traits significantly enhanced compared to the wild type (Nipponbare). BiFC showed that PmABI5 undergoes homologous dimerization in addition to forming a heterodimer with either PmbZIP33 or PmbZIP131. Further yeast one-hybrid experiments showed that <i>PmABI5</i> and <i>PmbZIP131</i> regulate the expression of <i>PmNAC1</i> by binding to the G-box in the promoter. These results indicate that <i>PmABI5</i> can directly regulate seed germination and seedling growth and indirectly improve the salt tolerance of plants by regulating the expression of the <i>PmNAC1</i> gene through the formation of heterodimers with <i>PmbZIP131</i>.
