Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is an important oilseed crop. Despite a short period of domestication and breeding, rapeseed has formed three diverse ecotype groups, namely spring, winter, and semi-winter. However, the genetic changes among the three ecotype groups have remained largely unknown. To detect selective signals, a set of 327 accessions from a worldwide collection were genotyped using a Brassica array, producing 33 186 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was unevenly distributed across the genome. A total of 705 (78.2%) weak LD regions were found in the A subgenome, whereas 445 (72.6%) strong LD regions were in the C subgenome. By calculating the nucleotide diversity and population differentiation indices, a total of 198 selective sweeps were identified across ecotype groups, spanning 5.91% (37.9 Mb) of the genome. Within these genome regions, a few known functional genes or loci were found to be in association with environmental adaptability and yield-related traits. In particular, all 12 SNPs detected in significant association with flowering time among accessions were in the selection regions between ecotype groups. These findings provide new insights into the structure of the B. napus genome and uncover the footprints of domestication and breeding.
