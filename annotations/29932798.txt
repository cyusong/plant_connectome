Production and isolation of recombinant proteins are key steps in modern Molecular Biology. Expression vectors and platforms for various hosts, including both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, have been used. In basic plant research, Arabidopsis thaliana is the central model for which a wealth of genetic and genomic resources is available, and enormous knowledge has been accumulated over the past years - especially since elucidation of its genome in 2000. However, until recently an Arabidopsis platform had been lacking for preparative-scale production of homologous recombinant proteins. We recently established an Arabidopsis-based super-expression system, and used it for a structural pilot study of a multi-subunit integral membrane protein complex. This review summarizes the benefits and further potential of the model plant system for protein productions. Nb, Nicotiana benthamiana; OT, oligosaccharyltransferase.
