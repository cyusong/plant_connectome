Wasabi (Eutrema japonicum) is a perennial plant native to Japan that is used as a spice because it contains isothiocyanates. It also contains an isosaponarin, 4'-O-glucosyl-6-C-glucosyl apigenin, in its leaves, which has received increasing attention in recent years for its bioactivity, such as its promotion of type-I collagen production. However, its biosynthetic enzymes have not been clarified. In this study, we partially purified a C-glucosyltransferase (CGT) involved in isosaponarin biosynthesis from wasabi leaves and identified the gene coding for it (WjGT1). The encoded protein was similar to UGT84 enzymes and was named UGT84A57. The recombinant enzyme of WjGT1 expressed in Escherichia coli showed C-glucosylation activity toward the 6-position of flavones such as apigenin and luteolin. The enzyme also showed significant activity toward flavonols, but trace or no activity toward flavone 4'-O-glucosides, suggesting that isosaponarin biosynthesis in wasabi plants would proceed by 6-C-glucosylation of apigenin, followed by its 4'-O-glucosylation. Interestingly, the enzyme showed no activity against sinapic acid or p-coumaric acid, which are usually the main substrates of UGT84 enzymes. The accumulation of WjGT1 transcripts was observed mainly in the leaves and flowers of wasabi, in which C-glucosylflavones were accumulated. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that WjGT1 acquired C-glycosylation activity independently from other reported CGTs after the differentiation of the family Brassicaceae.
