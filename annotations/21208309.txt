['21208309', 'Various mutant screens have been undertaken to identify constituents involved in  the transmission of signals from the plastid to the nucleus. Many of these  screens have been performed using carotenoid-deficient plants grown in the  presence of norflurazon (NF), an inhibitor of phytoene desaturase. NF-treated  plants are bleached and suppress the expression of nuclear genes encoding  chloroplast proteins. Several genomes uncoupled (gun) mutants have been isolated  that de-repress the expression of these nuclear genes. In the present study, a  genetic screen has been established that circumvents severe photo-oxidative  stress in NF-treated plants. Under these modified screening conditions, happy on  norflurazon (hon) mutants have been identified that, like gun mutants, de-repress  expression of the Lhcb gene, encoding a light-harvesting chlorophyll protein,  but, in contrast to wild-type and gun mutants, are green in the presence of NF.  hon mutations disturb plastid protein homeostasis, thereby activating plastid  signaling and inducing stress acclimatization. Rather than defining constituents  of a retrograde signaling pathway specifically associated with the NF-induced  suppression of nuclear gene expression, as proposed for gun, hon mutations affect  Lhcb expression more indirectly prior to initiation of plastid signaling in  NF-treated seedlings. They pre-condition seedlings by inducing stress  acclimatization, thereby attenuating the impact of a subsequent NF treatment.', '2011 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04454.x', 'Apel']
