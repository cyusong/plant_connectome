<i>Fusarium</i> species have been identified as pathogens causing many different plant diseases, and here we report an emerging banana leaf blight (BLB) caused by <i>F. sacchari</i> (<i>Fs</i>) discovered in Guangdong, China. From the symptomatic tissues collected in the field, a fungal isolate was obtained, which induced similar symptoms on healthy banana seedlings after inoculation. Koch's postulates were fulfilled after the re-isolation of the pathogen. Phylogenetic analysis on two gene segments and the whole genome sequence identified the pathogen belonging to <i>Fs</i> and named as <i>Fs</i> str. FS66. A 45.74 Mb genome of FS66 was acquired through <i>de novo</i> assembly using long-read sequencing data, and its contig N50 (1.97 Mb) is more than 10-fold larger than the previously available genome in the species. Based on transcriptome sequencing and <i>ab initio</i> gene annotation, a total of 14,486 protein-encoding genes and 418 non-coding RNAs were predicted. A total of 48 metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters including the fusaric acid biosynthesis gene cluster were predicted <i>in silico</i> in the FS66 genome. Comparison between FS66 and other 11 Fusarium genomes identified tens to hundreds of genes specifically gained and lost in FS66, including some previously correlated with <i>Fusarium</i> pathogenicity. The FS66 genome also harbors widespread gene transfer on the core chromosomes putatively from <i>F. oxysporum</i> species complex (FOSC), including 30 involved in <i>Fusarium</i> pathogenicity/virulence. This study not only reports the BLB caused by <i>Fs</i>, but also provides important information and clues for further understanding of the genome evolution among pathogenic <i>Fusarium</i> species.
