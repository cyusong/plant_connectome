['15653809', "Recently, we isolated the sulfite oxidase (SO) gene from Arabidopsis thaliana and  characterized the purified SO protein. The purpose of the present study was to  determine the subcellular localization of this novel plant enzyme. Immunogold  electron-microscopic analysis showed the gold labels nearly exclusively in the  peroxisomes. To verify this finding, green fluorescent protein was fused to  full-length plant SO including the putative peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1)  'SNL' and expressed in tobacco leaves. Our results showed a punctate fluorescence  pattern resembling that of peroxisomes. Co-labelling with MitoTracker-Red  excluded that the observed fluorescence was due to mitochondrial sorting. By  investigation of deleted or mutated PTS1, no functional peroxisomal targeting  signal 2 (PTS2) could be detected in plant SO. This conclusion is supported by  expression studies in Pichia pastoris mutants with defined defects either in  PTS1- or PTS2-mediated peroxisomal import.", '2004 Dec', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pch212', 'Hansch']
