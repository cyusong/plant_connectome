Sorghum is a short day plant with strong photoperiod response and its cultivation for grain in temperate regions necessitated the development of photoperiod insensitive mutants that can flower rapidly in the long days of summer. Wild type genotypes grow vegetatively in summer accumulating significant biomass before floral transition ensues during the shorter days of fall. Thus, photoperiod insensitive mutants are grown for grain production while photoperiod sensitive wild type genotypes are grown for forage and biomass feedstock production in the United States. However, the molecular mechanism of photoperiod response and floral transition is poorly understood in sorghum. We have previously reported 3 FLOWERING LOCUS T homologues (SbFT1, SbFT8 and SbFT10) that serve as the ultimate mediators of photoperiod response and floral transition, but more work remains to be done to clearly define the molecular function of the upstream regulatory factors. One of the major QTL that accounts for 85% of the flowering time variation, which was reported to be encoding the PRR37 protein is now debated to be encoding the SbFT12 protein, raising further questions as to how SbFT12 may regulate sorghum florigens. Further molecular analyses will uncover the true nature of the day length sensors in sorghum and the mechanisms of their interactions with florigens to modulate photoperiod dependent vegetative growth and floral transition.
