Ethylene (ETH) controls climacteric fruit ripening and can be triggered by osmotic stress. However, the mechanism regulating ETH biosynthesis during fruit ripening and under osmotic stress is largely unknown in apple (Malus domestica). Here, we explored the roles of SnRK2 protein kinases in ETH biosynthesis related to fruit ripening and osmoregulation. We identified the substrates of MdSnRK2-I using phosphorylation analysis techniques. Finally, we identified the MdSnRK2-I-mediated signaling pathway for ETH biosynthesis related to fruit ripening and osmoregulation. The activity of two MdSnRK2-I members, MdSnRK2.4 and MdSnRK2.9, was significantly upregulated during ripening or following mannitol treatment. Overexpression of MdSnRK2-I increased ETH biosynthesis under normal and osmotic conditions in apple fruit. MdSnRK2-I phosphorylated the transcription factors MdHB1 and MdHB2 to enhance their protein stability and transcriptional activity on MdACO1. MdSnRK2-I also interacted with MdACS1 and increased its protein stability through two phosphorylation sites. The increased MdACO1 expression and MdACS1 protein stability resulted in higher ETH production in apple fruit. In addition, heterologous expression of MdSnRK2-I or manipulation of SlSnRK2-I expression in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit altered fruit ripening and ETH biosynthesis. We established that MdSnRK2-I functions in fruit ripening and osmoregulation, and identified the MdSnRK2-I-mediated signaling pathway controlling ETH biosynthesis.
