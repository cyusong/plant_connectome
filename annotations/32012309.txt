Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub> S) is emerging as an important signalling molecule that regulates plant growth and abiotic stress responses. However, the roles of H<sub>2</sub> S in symbiotic nitrogen (N) assimilation and remobilization have not been characterized. Therefore, we examined how H<sub>2</sub> S influences the soybean (Glycine max)/rhizobia interaction in terms of symbiotic N fixation and mobilization during N deficiency-induced senescence. H<sub>2</sub> S enhanced biomass accumulation and delayed leaf senescence through effects on nodule numbers, leaf chlorophyll contents, leaf N resorption efficiency, and the N contents in different tissues. Moreover, grain numbers and yield were regulated by H<sub>2</sub> S and rhizobia, together with N accumulation in the organs, and N use efficiency. The synergistic effects of H<sub>2</sub> S and rhizobia were also demonstrated by effects on the enzyme activities, protein abundances, and gene expressions associated with N metabolism, and senescence-associated genes (SAGs) expression in soybeans grown under conditions of N deficiency. Taken together, these results show that H<sub>2</sub> S and rhizobia accelerate N assimilation and remobilization by regulation of the expression of SAGs during N deficiency-induced senescence. Thus, H<sub>2</sub> S enhances the vegetative and reproductive growth of soybean, presumably through interactions with rhizobia under conditions of N deficiency.
