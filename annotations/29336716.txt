In response to hypoxia, plant roots produce very high levels of nitric oxide. Recently, it was demonstrated that NO and ethylene both are essential for development of aerenchyma in wheat roots under hypoxia. Increased NO under hypoxia correlated with induction of NADPH oxidase gene expression, ROS production and lipid peroxidation in cortical cells. Tyrosine nitration was prominent in cells developing aerenchyma suggesting that NO and ROS play a key role in development of aerenchyma. However, the role of antioxidant genes during development of aerenchyma is not known, therefore, we checked gene expression of various antioxidants such as SOD1, AOX1A, APX and MnSOD at different time points after hypoxia treatment and found that expression of these genes elevated in 2 h but downregulated in 24 h where development of aerenchyma is prominent. Further, we found that plants growing under ammonium nutrition displayed delayed aerenchyma development. Taken together, new insights presented in this short communication highlighted additional regulatory role of antioxidants gene expression during aerenchyma development.

NO: !induces! NADPH oxidase gene expression
ROS: !promotes! lipid peroxidation
Tyrosine nitration: !suggests! role of NO and ROS
SOD1: !elevates! expression in 2h
AOX1A: !elevates! expression in 2h
APX: !elevates! expression in 2h
MnSOD: !elevates! expression in 2h
Ammonium nutrition: !delays! aerenchyma development
