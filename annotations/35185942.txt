Temperature is one of the climatic factors that shape the geographic distribution of plant populations. Mangroves are temperature-sensitive plants, and their distributions are severely limited by low temperatures. It is unknown, however, to what extent temperature contributes to their population differentiation and evolution. <i>Kandelia obovata</i> (Rhizophoraceae) is a mangrove species with high cold tolerance in the Northern Hemisphere. We investigated the phenotypic responses of an artificial population of <i>K. obovata</i>, with plants transplanted from different source populations, to extremely low temperatures during winter of 2015-2016 in Yueqing County (28°20'N), Zhejiang Province of China. Using two binary traits, "with/without leaves alive on the branches" and "with/without alive buds on the tips of branches," we classified plants in this artificial population into strong, moderate and poor cold resistance groups. We further assessed the genetic diversity, structure and differentiation of these three groups, as well as five natural populations along a latitudinal gradient using ten nuclear and six plastid microsatellite markers. Microsatellite data revealed genetic differentiation among the natural populations along the latitudinal gradient. Molecular data indicated that the cold tolerance of three groups in the artificial population was associated with their geographic origins, and that the most cold-tolerant group came from the northernmost natural population. Our study thus indicates that natural populations of <i>K. obovata</i> may have evolved divergent capacity of cold tolerance.
