['19783645', 'Peroxisomes are unique organelles involved in multiple cellular metabolic  pathways. Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical active in many physiological  functions under normal and stress conditions. Using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) wild type and mutants expressing green fluorescent protein through the  addition of peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1), which enables peroxisomes to  be visualized in vivo, this study analyzes the temporal and cell distribution of  NO during the development of 3-, 5-, 8-, and 11-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings and  shows that Arabidopsis peroxisomes accumulate NO in vivo. Pharmacological  analyses using nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors detected the presence of  putative calcium-dependent NOS activity. Furthermore, peroxins Pex12 and Pex13  appear to be involved in transporting the putative NOS protein to peroxisomes,  since pex12 and pex13 mutants, which are defective in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent  protein transport to peroxisomes, registered lower NO content. Additionally, we  show that under salinity stress (100 mM NaCl), peroxisomes are required for NO  accumulation in the cytosol, thereby participating in the generation of  peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) and in increasing protein tyrosine nitration, which is a  marker of nitrosative stress.', '2009 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.146100', 'Barroso']
