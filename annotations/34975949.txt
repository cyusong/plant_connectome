Flowering is an important biological process through which plants determine the timing of reproduction. In rice, florigen mRNA is induced more strongly when the day length is shorter than the critical day length through recognition of 30-min differences in the photoperiod. <i>Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7)</i>, which encodes a CCT-domain protein unique to monocots, has been identified as a key floral repressor in rice, and <i>Heading date 1 (Hd1)</i>, a rice ortholog of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> floral activator <i>CONSTANS (CO)</i>, is another key floral regulator gene. The Hd1 gene product has been shown to interact with the Ghd7 gene product to form a strong floral repressor complex under long-day conditions. However, the mRNA dynamics of these genes cannot explain the day-length responses of their downstream genes. Thus, a real-time monitoring system of these key gene products is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying accurate photoperiod recognition in rice. Here, we developed a monitoring system using luciferase (LUC) fusion protein lines derived from the <i>Ghd7-LUC</i> and <i>Hd1-LUC</i> genes. We successfully obtained a functionally complemented gene-targeted line for <i>Ghd7-LUC</i>. Using this system, we found that the Ghd7-LUC protein begins to accumulate rapidly after dawn and reaches its peak more rapidly under a short-day condition than under a long-day condition. Our system provides a powerful tool for revealing the accurate time-keeping regulation system incorporating these key gene products involved in rice photoperiodic flowering.
