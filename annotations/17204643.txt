['17204643', 'A key gene involved in plant senescence, mutations of which partially disable  chlorophyll catabolism and confer stay-green leaf and cotyledon phenotypes, has  been identified in Pisum sativum, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Festuca pratensis by  using classical and molecular genetics and comparative genomics. A stay-green  locus in F. pratensis is syntenically equivalent to a similar stay-green locus on  rice chromosome 9. Functional testing in Arabidopsis of a homolog of the rice  candidate gene revealed (i) senescence-associated gene expression and (ii) a  stay-green phenotype after RNA interference silencing. Genetic mapping in pea  demonstrated cosegregation with the yellow/green cotyledon polymorphism (I/i)  first reported by Gregor Mendel in 1866.', '2007 Jan 5', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1132912', 'King']
