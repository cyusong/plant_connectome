['21931939', 'Arabidopsis DREB2A is a key transcription factor of heat- and drought-responsive  gene expression, and DREB2A expression is induced by these stresses. We analyzed  the DREB2A promoter and found a heat shock element that functions as a cis-acting  element in the heat shock (HS)-responsive expression of DREB2A. Among the 21  Arabidopsis heat shock factors, we chose 4 HsfA1-type proteins as candidate  transcriptional activators (HsfA1a, HsfA1b, HsfA1d, and HsfA1e) based on  transactivation activity and expression patterns. We generated multiple mutants  and found that the HS-responsive expression of DREB2A disappeared in hsfa1a/b/d  triple and hsfa1a/b/d/e quadruple mutants. Moreover, HS-responsive gene  expression, including that of molecular chaperones and transcription factors, was  globally and drastically impaired in the hsfa1a/b/d triple mutant, which  exhibited greatly reduced tolerance to HS stress. HsfA1 protein accumulation in  the nucleus was negatively regulated by their interactions with HSP90, and other  factors potentially strongly activate the HsfA1 proteins under HS stress. The  hsfa1a/b/d/e quadruple mutant showed severe growth retardation, and many genes  were downregulated in this mutant even under non-stress conditions. Our study  indicates that HsfA1a, HsfA1b, and HsfA1d function as main positive regulators in  HS-responsive gene expression and four HsfA1-type proteins are important in gene  expression for normal plant growth.', '2011 Dec', 'Mol Genet Genomics', '10.1007/s00438-011-0647-7', 'Yamaguchi-Shinozaki']
