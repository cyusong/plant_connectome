The mechanisms underlying plant tolerance to boron (B) excess are far from fully understood. Here we characterized the role of the miR397-CsiLAC4/CsiLAC17 (from Citrus sinensis) module in regulation of B flow. Live-cell imaging techniques were used in localization studies. A tobacco transient expression system tested modulations of CsiLAC4 and CsiLAC17 by miR397. Transgenic Arabidopsis were generated to analyze the biological functions of CsiLAC4 and CsiLAC17. CsiLAC4's role in xylem lignification was determined by mRNA hybridization and cytochemistry. In situ B distribution was analyzed by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. CsiLAC4 and CsiLAC17 are predominantly localized in the apoplast of tobacco epidermal cells. Overexpression of CsiLAC4 in Arabidopsis improves the plants' tolerance to boric acid excess by triggering high-B-dependent lignification of the vascular system's cell wall and reducing free B content in roots and shoots. In Citrus, CsiLAC4 is expressed explicitly in the xylem parenchyma and is modulated by B-responsive miR397. Upregulation of CsiLAC4 in Citrus results in lignification of the xylem cell walls, restricting B flow from xylem vessels to the phloem. CsiLAC4 contributes to plant tolerance to boric acid excess via high-B-dependent lignification of cell walls, which set up a 'physical barrier' preventing B flow.
