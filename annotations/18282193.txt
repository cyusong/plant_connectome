The effects of high and low N concentrations on the Solanum tuberosum-Phytophthora infestans interaction were studied in the potato cultivars Bettina, New York 121, Indira and Arkula, which exhibited different levels of resistance. Aboveground biomass and Chl and N content were significantly higher in all cultivars grown in higher N environments, while C:N ratios were lower, confirming successful application of N. High availability of N significantly increased susceptibility of three of the four potato cultivars, and amounts of pathogen within the infected leaflets determined in a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction reflected this. Differential gene expression of P. infestans-induced and -repressed genes derived from three subtracted cDNA libraries at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation was studied in parallel. P. infestans attack led to an induction of defense-related and at the same time repression of growth-related potato genes mainly encoding photosynthetic genes. High N supply led to higher transcript abundance of photosynthetic genes such as Chl a/b-binding protein and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. N-dependent suppression of defense-related compounds in absence of the pathogen was not observed. Better N nutrition appeared to allow the plants to invest more resources in defense reactions.
