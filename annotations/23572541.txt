['23572541', 'Telomeres protect chromosome ends from being recognized as DNA damage, and they  facilitate the complete replication of linear chromosomes. CST [for  CTC1(Cdc13)/STN1/TEN1] is a trimeric chromosome end binding complex implicated in  both aspects of telomere function. Here, we characterize TEN1 in the flowering  plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We report that TEN1 (for telomeric pathways in  association with Stn1, which stands for suppressor of cdc thirteen) is encoded by  a previously characterized gene, MERISTEM DISORGANIZATION1 (MDO1). A point  mutation in MDO1, mdo1-1/ten1-3 (G77E), triggers stem cell differentiation and  death as well as a constitutive DNA damage response. We provide biochemical and  genetic evidence that ten1-3 is likely to be a null mutation. As with ctc1 and  stn1 null mutants, telomere tracts in ten1-3 are shorter and more heterogeneous  than the wild type. Mutants also exhibit frequent telomere fusions, increased  single-strand telomeric DNA, and telomeric circles. However, unlike stn1 or ctc1  mutants, telomerase enzyme activity is elevated in ten1-3 mutants due to an  increase in repeat addition processivity. In addition, TEN1 is detected at a  significantly smaller fraction of telomeres than CTC1. These data indicate that  TEN1 is critical for telomere stability and also plays an unexpected role in  modulating telomerase enzyme activity.', '2013 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.107425', 'Shippen']
