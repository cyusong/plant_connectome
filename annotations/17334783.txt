Understanding of the molecular interplay, which determines early steps of flower formation has grown considerably during last years. In contrast, genetic actions responsible for how flower organs acquire their size and shape at later phases of organogenesis are still poorly understood. We have exploited the large and anatomically simple Gerbera (Gerbera hybrida var. Terra regina) ray flower petals to describe transcriptional changes during organogenesis. Gerbera 9 K cDNA microarray was utilized to profile gene expression at six different developmental stages of petal organogenesis, at the earliest stage expansion of petals is starting and at the latest stage petals have reached their final size and shape. Genes potentially participating in petal opening were identified based on the similarity in expression with a known marker gene. Our results showed characteristic sets of genes expressed during the cell division and cell expansion phases of petal development. Interestingly, there was a transition stage during which neither cell division nor cell expansion marker genes were abundantly expressed. Moreover, constitutive expression of late petal specific genes indicates that they participate in petal organogenesis throughout the development and they are not involved in stage specific switch points.
