['35682638', 'Fertilization is a key event for sexually reproducing plants. Pollen-stigma  adhesion, which is the first step in male-female interaction during  fertilization, requires proper pollen wall patterning. Callose, which is a  beta-1.3-glucan, is an essential polysaccharide that is required for pollen  development and pollen wall formation. Mutations in CALLOSE SYNTHASE 5 (CalS5)  disrupt male meiotic callose accumulation; however, how CalS5 activity and  callose synthesis are regulated is not fully understood. In this paper, we report  the isolation of a kompeito-1 (kom-1) mutant defective in pollen wall patterning  and pollen-stigma adhesion in Arabidopsis thaliana. Callose was not accumulated  in kom-1 meiocytes or microspores, which was very similar to the cals5 mutant.  The KOM gene encoded a member of a subclass of Rhomboid serine protease proteins  that lacked active site residues. KOM was localized to the Golgi apparatus, and  both KOM and CalS5 genes were highly expressed in meiocytes. A 220 kDa CalS5  protein was detected in wild-type (Col-0) floral buds but was dramatically  reduced in kom-1. These results suggested that KOM was required for CalS5 protein  accumulation, leading to the regulation of meiocyte-specific callose accumulation  and pollen wall formation.', '2022 May 25', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms23115959', 'Okada']
