Monosaccharide transporters (MSTs) represent key components of the carbon transport and partitioning mechanisms in plants, mediating the cell-to-cell and long-distance distribution of a wide variety of monosaccharides. In this study, we performed a thorough structural, molecular, and physiological characterization of the monosaccharide transporter gene family in the model legume Medicago truncatula. The complete set of MST family members was identified with a novel bioinformatic approach. Prolonged darkness was used as a test condition to identify the relevant transcriptomic and metabolic responses combining MST transcript profiling and metabolomic analysis. Our results suggest that MSTs play a pivotal role in the efficient partitioning and utilization of sugars, and possibly in the mechanisms of carbon remobilization in nodules upon photosynthate-limiting conditions, as nodules are forced to acquire a new role as a source of both C and N.
