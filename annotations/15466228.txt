['15466228', 'In Arabidopsis, ethylene is perceived by a receptor family consisting of five  members, one of these being ETR1. The N-terminal half of ETR1 functions as a  signal input domain. The C-terminal region of ETR1, consisting of a His kinase  domain and a putative receiver domain, is likely to function in signal output.  The role of the proposed signal output region in ethylene signaling was examined  in planta. For this purpose, the ability of mutant versions of ETR1 to rescue the  constitutive ethylene-response phenotype of the etr1-6;etr2-3;ein4-4 triple  loss-of-function mutant line was examined. A truncated version of ETR1 that lacks  both the His kinase domain and the receiver domain failed to rescue the triple  mutant phenotype. A truncated ETR1 receptor that lacks only the receiver domain  restored normal growth to the triple mutant in air, but the transgenic seedlings  displayed hypersensitivity to low doses of ethylene. A mutation that eliminated  His kinase activity had a modest effect upon the ability of the receptor to  repress ethylene responses in air. These results demonstrate that the His kinase  domain plays a role in the repression of ethylene responses. The potential roles  of the receiver domain and His kinase activity in ethylene signaling are  discussed.', '2004 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.047126', 'Schaller']
