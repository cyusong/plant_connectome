The agriculture sector has been put under tremendous strain by the world's growing population. The use of fertilizers and pesticides in conventional farming has had a negative impact on the environment and human health. Sustainable agriculture attempts to maintain productivity, while protecting the environment and feeding the global population. The importance of soil-dwelling microbial populations in overcoming these issues cannot be overstated. Various processes such as rhizospheric competence, antibiosis, release of enzymes, and induction of systemic resistance in host plants are all used by microbes to influence plant-microbe interactions. These processes are largely founded on chemical signalling. Producing, releasing, detecting, and responding to chemicals are all part of chemical signalling. Different microbes released distinct sorts of chemical signal molecules which interacts with the environment and hosts. Microbial chemicals affect symbiosis, virulence, competence, conjugation, antibiotic production, motility, sporulation, and biofilm growth, to name a few. We present an in-depth overview of chemical signalling between bacteria-bacteria, bacteria-fungi, and plant-microbe and the diverse roles played by these compounds in plant microbe interactions. These compounds' current and potential uses and significance in agriculture have been highlighted.
