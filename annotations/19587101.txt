['19587101', 'To date, there have been no reports on screening for mutants defective in the  massive accumulation of Rubisco in higher plants. Here, we describe a screening  method based on the toxic accumulation of ammonia in the presence of methionine  sulfoximine, a specific inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, during  photorespiration initiated by the oxygenase reaction of Rubisco in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). Five recessive mutants with decreased amounts of Rubisco  were identified and designated as nara mutants, as they contained a mutation in  genes necessary for the achievement of Rubisco accumulation. The nara5-1 mutant  showed markedly lower levels of plastid-encoded photosynthetic proteins,  including Rubisco. Map-based cloning revealed that NARA5 encoded a chloroplast  phosphofructokinase B-type carbohydrate kinase family protein of unknown  function. The NARA5 protein fused to green fluorescent protein localized in  chloroplasts. We conducted expression analyses of photosynthetic genes during  light-induced greening of etiolated seedlings of nara5-1 and the T-DNA insertion  mutant, nara5-2. Our results strongly suggest that NARA5 is indispensable for  hyperexpression of photosynthetic genes encoded in the plastid genome,  particularly rbcL.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.139683', 'Yokota']
