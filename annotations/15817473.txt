['15817473', 'Flavonoids represent one of the oldest, largest, and most diverse families of  plant secondary metabolites. These compounds serve a wide range of functions in  plants, from pigmentation and UV protection to the regulation of hormone  transport. Flavonoids also have interesting pharmacological activities in animals  that are increasingly being characterized in terms of effects on specific  proteins or other macromolecules. Although flavonoids are found in many different  locations both inside and outside the cell, biosynthesis has long been believed  to take place exclusively in the cytoplasm. Recent reports from a number of  different plant species have documented the presence of flavonoids in nuclei,  raising the possibility of novel mechanisms of action for these compounds. Here  we present evidence that not only flavonoids, but also at least two of the  biosynthetic enzymes, are located in the nucleus in several cell types in  Arabidopsis. This is the first indication that differential targeting of the  biosynthetic machinery may be used to regulate the deposition of plant secondary  products at diverse sites of action within the cell.', '2005 Jun 24', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M413506200', 'Winkel']
