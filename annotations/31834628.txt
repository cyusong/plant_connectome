Plant genomes contain two major classes of innate immune receptors to recognize different pathogens. The pattern recognition receptors perceive conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the resistance genes with nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains recognize specific pathogen effectors. The precise regulation of resistance genes is important since the unregulated expression of NB-LRR genes can inhibit growth and may result in autoimmunity in the absence of pathogen infection. It was shown that a subset of miRNAs could target NB-LRR genes and act as an important regulator of plant immunity in the absence of pathogens. Plants not only interact with pathogens, but they can also establish symbiotic interactions with microbes. Nitrogen-fixing symbiotic interaction and nodule formation of legumes may also require the suppression of host defence to prevent immune responses. We found that upon symbiotic interactions, miRNAs repressing NB-LRR expression are upregulated in the developing nodules of Medicago truncatula. Furthermore, we show that the suppression of the activity of the NB-LRR genes targeted by these miRNAs is important during nodule development. Our results suggest that the downregulation of NB-LRR resistance genes in the developing nodule produces a suitable niche that facilitates bacterial colonization and the development of an N-fixing nodule.
