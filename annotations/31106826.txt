Nitric oxide (NO) is now established as an important signalling molecule in plants where it influences growth, development, and responses to stress. Despite extensive research, the most appropriate methods to measure and localize these signalling radicals are debated and still need investigation. Many confounding factors such as the presence of other reactive intermediates, scavenging enzymes, and compartmentation influence how accurately each can be measured. Further, these signalling radicals have short half-lives ranging from seconds to minutes based on the cellular redox condition. Hence, it is necessary to use sensitive and specific methods in order to understand the contribution of each signalling molecule to various biological processes. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on NO measurement in plant samples, via various methods. We also discuss advantages, limitations, and wider applications of each method.
