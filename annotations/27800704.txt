Plant plasma membrane (PM) plays important roles in immune response. Here, we utilized quantitative mass spectrometry to explore rice PM protein composition and dynamic changes during Magnaporthe oryzae infection. We report, thus far, the largest rice PM proteome dataset with 3,906 identified proteins, among which 484 proteins were differentially expressed after M. oryzae infection. One third of the identified proteins are predicted to have at least one transmembrane domain. Half of the identified proteins are predicted to have binding functions and over one third of the proteins have enzyme-related functions. In addition, Gene Ontology analyses revealed that abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin (CK) signaling were sequentially activated after M. oryzae infection in rice. We found that the activation of ABA signaling and the suppression of rice immune response occurred at the early infection stage, while the activation of CK signaling, the upregulation of sugar transporter genes expression, and the nutrient efflux of infected rice cells occurred at later infection stage. Thus, we further propose that M. oryzae activates ABA signaling to repress rice immune signaling for initial invasion and redirects nutrient efflux of infected cells for massive growth at the later infection stage.
