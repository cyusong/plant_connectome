Cereal endosperm comprises an outer aleurone and an inner starchy endosperm. Although these two tissues have the same developmental origin, they differ in morphology, cell fate, and storage product accumulation, with the mechanism largely unknown. Here, we report the identification and characterization of rice thick aleurone 1 (ta1) mutant that shows an increased number of aleurone cell layers and increased contents of nutritional factors including proteins, lipids, vitamins, dietary fibers, and micronutrients. We identified that the TA1 gene, which is expressed in embryo, aleurone, and subaleurone in caryopses, encodes a mitochondrion-targeted protein with single-stranded DNA-binding activity named OsmtSSB1. Cytological analyses revealed that the increased aleurone cell layers in ta1 originate from a developmental switch of subaleurone toward aleurone instead of starchy endosperm in the wild type. We found that TA1/OsmtSSB1 interacts with mitochondrial DNA recombinase RECA3 and DNA helicase TWINKLE, and downregulation of RECA3 or TWINKLE also leads to ta1-like phenotypes. We further showed that mutation in TA1/OsmtSSB1 causes elevated illegitimate recombinations in the mitochondrial genome, altered mitochondrial morphology, and compromised energy supply, suggesting that the OsmtSSB1-mediated mitochondrial function plays a critical role in subaleurone cell-fate determination in rice.
