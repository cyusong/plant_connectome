Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) activities are involved in mediating plant cell responses to environmental stimuli. Two variants of PI-PLC have been partially purified from the roots of oat seedlings; one cytosolic and one particulate. Although the cytosolic enzyme was significantly purified, the activity still co-migrated with a number of other proteins on heparin HPLC and also on size-exclusion chromatography. The partially purified PI-PLC was tested by Western blotting, and we found that actin and actin-binding proteins, profilin and tropomyosin, co-purified with cytosolic phospholipase C. After a non-ionic detergent (Triton X-100) treatment, PI-PLC activities still remained with the actin cytoskeleton. The effects of phalloidin and F-buffer confirmed this association; these conditions, which favor actin polymerization, decreased the release of PI-PLC from the cytoskeleton. The treatments of latrunculin and G-buffer, the conditions that favor actin depolymerization, increased the release of PI-PLC from the cytoskeleton. These results suggest that oat PI-PLC associates with the actin cytoskeleton.
