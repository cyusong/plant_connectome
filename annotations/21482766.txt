['21482766', 'Adverse environmental conditions produce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in  plants. In response to heat or ER stress agents, Arabidopsis seedlings mitigate  stress damage by activating ER-associated transcription factors and a RNA  splicing factor, IRE1b. IRE1b splices the mRNA-encoding bZIP60, a basic  leucine-zipper domain containing transcription factor associated with the  unfolded protein response in plants. bZIP60 is required for the up-regulation of  BINDING PROTEIN3 (BIP3) in response to ER stress, and loss-of-function mutations  in IRE1b or point mutations in the splicing site of bZIP60 mRNA are defective in  BIP3 induction. These findings demonstrate that bZIP60 in plants is activated by  RNA splicing and afford opportunities for monitoring and modulating stress  responses in plants.', '2011 Apr 26', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1102117108', 'Howell']
