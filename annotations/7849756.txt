['7849756', 'In plant development, leaf primordia are formed on the flanks of the shoot apical  meristem in a highly predictable pattern. The cells that give rise to a  primordium are sequestered from the apical meristem. Maintenance of the meristem  requires that these cells be replaced by the addition of new cells. Despite the  central role of these activities in development, the mechanism controlling and  coordinating them is poorly understood. These processes have been characterized  in the Arabidopsis mutant forever young (fey). The fey mutation results in a  disruption of leaf positioning and meristem maintenance. The predicted FEY  protein shares significant homology to a nodulin and limited homology to various  reductases. It is proposed that FEY plays a role in communication in the shoot  apex through the modification of a factor regulating meristem development.', '1994 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1994.6060835.x', 'Medford']
