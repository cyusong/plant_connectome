Fluorescence imaging has shown great potential in non-invasive plant monitoring and analysis. However, current systems have several limitations, such as bulky size, high cost, contact measurement, and lack of multifunctionality, which may hinder its applications in a wide range of settings including indoor vertical farming. Herein, we developed a compact handheld fluorescence imager enabling multipurpose plant phenotyping, such as continuous photosynthetic activity monitoring and non-destructive anthocyanin quantification. The compact imager comprises of pulse-amplitude-modulated multi-color light emitting diodes (LEDs), optimized light illumination and collection, dedicated driver circuit board, miniaturized charge-coupled device camera, and associated image analytics. Experiments conducted in drought stressed lettuce proved that the novel imager could quantitatively evaluate the plant stress by the non-invasive measurement of photosynthetic activity efficiency. Moreover, a non-invasive and fast quantification of anthocyanins in green and red Batavia lettuce leaves had excellent correlation (>84%) with conventional destructive biochemical analysis. Preliminary experimental results emphasize the high throughput monitoring capability and multifunctionality of our novel handheld fluorescence imager, indicating its tremendous potential in modern agriculture.
