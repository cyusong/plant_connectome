Photosynthetic eukaryotes exhibit very different light-harvesting proteins, but all contain membrane-intrinsic light-harvesting complexes (Lhcs), either as additional or sole antennae. Lhcs non-covalently bind chlorophyll a and in most cases another Chl, as well as very different carotenoids, depending on the taxon. The proteins fall into two major groups: The well-defined Lhca/b group of proteins binds typically Chl b and lutein, and the group is present in the 'green lineage'. The other group consists of Lhcr/Lhcf, Lhcz and Lhcx/LhcSR proteins. The former are found in the so-called Chromalveolates, where they mostly bind Chl c and carotenoids very efficient in excitation energy transfer, and in their red algae ancestors. Lhcx/LhcSR are present in most Chromalveolates and in some members of the green lineage as well. Lhcs function in light harvesting, but also in photoprotection, and they influence the organisation of the thylakoid membrane. The different functions of the Lhc subfamilies are discussed in the light of their evolution.

Lhca/b: !binds! Chl b and lutein
Lhcr/Lhcf: !binds! Chl c and carotenoids
Lhcz: !binds! Chl c and carotenoids
Lhcx/LhcSR: !binds! Chl c and carotenoids
Lhcs: !function in! light harvesting, photoprotection, thylakoid membrane organisation
