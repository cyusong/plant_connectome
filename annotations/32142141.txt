Pollen development is critical to the reproductive success of flowering plants, but how it is regulated is not well understood. Here, we isolated two allelic male-sterile mutants of OsMYB80 and investigated how OsMYB80 regulates male fertility in rice. OsMYB80 was barely expressed in tissues other than anthers, where it initiated the expression during meiosis, reached the peak at the tetrad-releasing stage and then quickly declined afterward. The osmyb80 mutants exhibited premature tapetum cell death, lack of Ubisch bodies, no exine and microspore degeneration. To understand how OsMYB80 regulates anther development, RNA-seq analysis was conducted to identify genes differentially regulated by OsMYB80 in rice anthers. In addition, DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) analysis was performed to identify DNA fragments interacting with OsMYB80 in vitro. Overlap of the genes identified by RNA-seq and DAP-seq revealed 188 genes that were differentially regulated by OsMYB80 and also carried an OsMYB80-interacting DNA element in the promoter. Ten of these promoter elements were randomly selected for gel shift assay and yeast one-hybrid assay, and all showed OsMYB80 binding. The 10 promoters also showed OsMYB80-dependent induction when co-expressed in rice protoplast. Functional annotation of the 188 genes suggested that OsMYB80 regulates male fertility by directly targeting multiple biological processes. The identification of these genes significantly enriched the gene networks governing anther development and provided much new information for the understanding of pollen development and male fertility.
