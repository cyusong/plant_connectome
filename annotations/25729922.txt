['25729922', 'The sensing of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) triggers innate  immunity in animals and plants. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative  bacteria is a potent MAMP for mammals, with the lipid A moiety activating  proinflammatory responses via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Here we found that the  plant Arabidopsis thaliana specifically sensed LPS of Pseudomonas and  Xanthomonas. We isolated LPS-insensitive mutants defective in the bulb-type  lectin S-domain-1 receptor-like kinase LORE (SD1-29), which were hypersusceptible  to infection with Pseudomonas syringae. Targeted chemical degradation of LPS from  Pseudomonas species suggested that LORE detected mainly the lipid A moiety of  LPS. LORE conferred sensitivity to LPS onto tobacco after transient expression,  which demonstrated a key function in LPS sensing and indicated the possibility of  engineering resistance to bacteria in crop species.', '2015 Apr', 'Nat Immunol', '10.1038/ni.3124', 'Scheel']
