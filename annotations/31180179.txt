High amylose starch can be produced by plants deficient in the function of branching enzymes (BEs). Here we report the production of transgenic cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) with starches containing up to 50% amylose due to the constitutive expression of hair-pin dsRNAs targeting the BE1 or BE2 genes. All BE1-RNAi plant lines (BE1i) and BE2-RNAi plant lines (BE2i) were grown up in the field, but with reduced total biomass production. Considerably high amylose content in the storage roots of BE2i plant lines was achieved. Storage starch granules of BE1i and BE2i plants had similar morphology as wild type (WT), however, the size of BE1i starch granules were bigger than that of WT. Comparisons of amylograms and thermograms of all three sources of storage starches revealed dramatic changes to the pasting properties and a higher melting temperature for BE2i starches. Glucan chain length distribution analysis showed a slight increase in chains of DP>36 in BE1i lines and a dramatic increase in glucan chains between DP 10-20 and DP>40 in BE2i lines. Furthermore, BE2i starches displayed a B-type X-ray diffraction pattern instead of the A-type pattern found in BE1i and WT starches. Therefore, cassava BE1 and BE2 function differently in storage root starch biosynthesis.
