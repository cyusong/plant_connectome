['8888624', 'A cDNA encoding a luminal binding protein (BiP) was isolated from Arabidopsis  thaliana. In Arabidopsis seedlings, accumulation of transcripts for BiP was  induced not only by inhibition of the N-glycosylation of proteins by tunicamycin  but also by inhibition of the processing of N-linked glycans by castanospermine.  Heat-shock stress also induced accumulation of the transcripts in Arabidopsis.', '1996 Sep', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029023', 'Koizumi']
