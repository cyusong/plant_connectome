RNA polymerase II-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) regulates the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase primarily by modulating the expression of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS M</i> [<i>FLM</i>, also known as <i>MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING1</i> (<i>MAF1</i>)] at standard growth temperatures. However, the role of PAF1C in the regulation of flowering time at chilling temperatures (i.e., cold temperatures that are above freezing) and whether PAF1C affects other <i>FLC</i>-clade genes (<i>MAF2</i>-<i>MAF5</i>) remains unknown. Here, we showed that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants of any of the six known genes that encode components of PAF1C [<i>CELL DIVISION CYCLE73/PLANT HOMOLOGOUS TO PARAFIBROMIN</i>, <i>VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE2</i> (<i>VIP2</i>)/<i>EARLY FLOWERING7</i> (<i>ELF7</i>), <i>VIP3</i>, <i>VIP4</i>, <i>VIP5</i>, and <i>VIP6/ELF8</i>] showed temperature-insensitive early flowering across a broad temperature range (10°C-27°C). Flowering of PAF1C-deficient mutants at 10°C was even earlier than that in <i>flc</i>, <i>flm</i>, and <i>flc flm</i> mutants, suggesting that PAF1C regulates additional factors. Indeed, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of PAF1C-deficient mutants revealed downregulation of <i>MAF2-MAF5</i> in addition to <i>FLC</i> and <i>FLM</i> at both 10 and 23°C. Consistent with the reduced expression of <i>FLC</i> and the <i>FLC</i>-clade members <i>FLM/MAF1</i> and <i>MAF2-MAF5</i>, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR assays showed reduced levels of the permissive epigenetic modification H3K4me3/H3K36me3 and increased levels of the repressive modification H3K27me3 at their chromatin. Knocking down <i>MAF2-MAF5</i> using artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) in the <i>flc flm</i> background (<i>35S::amiR-MAF2-5 flc flm</i>) resulted in significantly earlier flowering than <i>flc flm</i> mutants and even earlier than <i>short vegetative phase</i> (<i>svp</i>) mutants at 10°C. Wild-type seedlings showed higher accumulation of <i>FLC</i> and <i>FLC</i>-clade gene transcripts at 10°C compared to 23°C. Our yeast two-hybrid assays and <i>in vivo</i> co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analyses revealed that MAF2-MAF5 directly interact with the prominent floral repressor SVP. Late flowering caused by <i>SVP</i> overexpression was almost completely suppressed by the <i>elf7</i> and <i>vip4</i> mutations, suggesting that SVP-mediated floral repression required a functional PAF1C. Taken together, our results showed that PAF1C regulates the transcription of <i>FLC</i> and <i>FLC</i>-clade genes to modulate temperature-responsive flowering at a broad range of temperatures and that the interaction between SVP and these FLC-clade proteins is important for floral repression.
