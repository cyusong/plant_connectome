['23250427', 'Arabidopsis thaliana CRT1 (compromised for recognition of Turnip Crinkle Virus)  was previously shown to be required for effector-triggered immunity. Sequence  analyses previously revealed that CRT1 contains the ATPase and S5 domains  characteristic of Microchidia (MORC) proteins; these proteins are associated with  DNA modification and repair. Here we show that CRT1 and its closest homologue,  CRH1, are also required for pathogen-associated molecular pattern  (PAMP)-triggered immunity, basal resistance, non-host resistance and systemic  acquired resistance. Consistent with its role in PAMP-triggered immunity, CRT1  interacted with the PAMP recognition receptor FLS2. Subcellular fractionation and  transmission electron microscopy detected a subpopulation of CRT1 in the nucleus,  whose levels increased following PAMP treatment or infection with an avirulent  pathogen. These results, combined with the demonstration that CRT1 binds DNA,  exhibits endonuclease activity, and affects tolerance to the DNA-damaging agent  mitomycin C, argue that this prototypic eukaryotic member of the MORC superfamily  has important nuclear functions during immune response activation.', '2012', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms2279', 'Klessig']
