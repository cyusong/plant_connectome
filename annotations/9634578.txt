['9634578', 'A new mutant called psi2 (for phytochrome signaling) was isolated by screening  for elevated activity of a chlorophyll a/b binding protein-luciferase (CAB2-LUC)  transgene in Arabidopsis. This mutant exhibited hypersensitive induction of CAB1,  CAB2, and the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RBCS)  promoters in the very low fluence range of red light and a hypersensitive  response in hypocotyl growth in continuous red light of higher fluences. In  addition, at high- but not low-light fluence rates, the mutant showed  light-dependent superinduction of the pathogen-related protein gene PR-1a and  developed spontaneous necrotic lesions in the absence of any pathogen. Expression  of genes responding to various hormone and environmental stress pathways in the  mutant was not significantly different from that of the wild type. Analysis of  double mutants demonstrated that the effects of the psi2 mutation are dependent  on both phytochromes phyA and phyB. The mutation is recessive and maps to the  bottom of chromosome 5. Together, our results suggest that PSI2 specifically and  negatively regulates both phyA and phyB phototransduction pathways. The induction  of cell death by deregulated signaling pathways observed in psi2 is reminiscent  of retinal degenerative diseases in animals and humans.', '1998 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.6.889', 'Chua']
