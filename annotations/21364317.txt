Asymmetric cell division is a universal strategy to generate diverse cell types necessary for patterning and proliferation of all eukaryotes. The development of haploid male gametophytes (pollen grains) in flowering plants is a remarkable example in which division asymmetry governs the functional specialization and germline differentiation essential for double fertilization. The male gametophyte is patterned via two mitotic divisions resulting in three highly differentiated daughter cells at maturity, a vegetative cell and two sperm cells. The first asymmetric division segregates a unique male germ cell from an undetermined haploid microspore and is executed in an elaborate sequence of cellular events. However the molecular mechanisms governing the division asymmetry in microspores are poorly understood. Recently we studied the phenotype of sidecar pollen (scp) mutants in detail, and demonstrated a requirement of SCP for both the correct timing and orientation of microspore division. SCP is a microspore-specific member of the LOB/AS2 domain family (LBD27/ASL29) showing that a plant-specific regulator plays a key role in oriented division of polarized microspores. Identification of SCP will serve as a new platform to further explore the largely unknown molecular networks regulating division asymmetry in microspores that establishes the male germline in flowering plants.
