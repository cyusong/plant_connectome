Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) is one of the indispensable elements in plant growth and development. The Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel protein family is involved in plant K<sup>+</sup> uptake and distribution. Foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i>), as an important crop, has strong tolerance and adaptability to abiotic stresses. However, no systematic study focused on the Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel family in foxtail millet. Here, ten Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel genes in foxtail millet were identified and divided into five groups through phylogenetic analysis. Gene structures, chromosome locations, cis-acting regulatory elements in promoter, and post-translation modification sites of Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channels were analyzed. <i>In silico</i> analysis of transcript level demonstrated that the expression of Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel genes was tissue or developmental stage specific. The transcription levels of Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel genes in foxtail millet under different abiotic stresses (cold, heat, NaCl, and PEG) and phytohormones (6-BA, BR, MJ, IAA, NAA, GA3, SA, and ABA) treatments at 0, 12, and 24 h were detected by qRT-PCR. The results showed that <i>SiAKT1</i>, <i>SiKAT3, SiGORK</i>, and <i>SiSKOR</i> were worth further research due to their significant responses after most treatments. The yeast complementation assay verified the inward K<sup>+</sup> transport activities of detectable Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channels. Finally, we found interactions between SiKAT2 and SiSNARE proteins. Compared to research in Arabidopsis, our results showed a difference in SYP121 related Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel regulation mechanism in foxtail millet. Our results indicate that Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channels play important roles in foxtail millet and provide theoretical support for further exploring the K<sup>+</sup> absorption mechanism of foxtail millet under abiotic stress.
