Allopolyploids have globally higher fitness than their diploid progenitors; however, by comparison, most resynthesized allopolyploids have poor fertility and highly unstable genome. Elucidating the evolutionary processes promoting genome stabilization and fertility is thus essential to comprehend allopolyploid success. Using the Brassica model, we mimicked the speciation process of a nascent allopolyploid species by resynthesizing allotetraploid Brassica napus and systematically selecting for euploid individuals over eight generations in four independent allopolyploidization events with contrasted genetic backgrounds, cytoplasmic donors, and polyploid formation type. We evaluated the evolution of meiotic behavior and fertility and identified rearrangements in S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>9</sub> lineages to explore the positive consequences of euploid selection on B. napus genome stability. Recurrent selection of euploid plants for eight generations drastically reduced the percentage of aneuploid progenies as early as the fourth generation, concomitantly with a decrease in number of newly fixed homoeologous rearrangements. The consequences of homoeologous rearrangements on meiotic behavior and seed number depended strongly on the genetic background and cytoplasm donor. The combined use of both self-fertilization and recurrent euploid selection allowed identification of genomic regions associated with fertility and meiotic behavior, providing complementary evidence to explain B. napus speciation success.
