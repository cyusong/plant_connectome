During the process of growth and development, plants are prone to various biotic and abiotic stresses. They have evolved a variety of strategies to resist the adverse effects of these stresses. lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are a type of less conserved RNA molecules of more than 200 nt (nucleotides) in length. lncRNAs do not code for any protein, but interact with DNA, RNA, and protein to affect transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and epigenetic modulation events. As a new regulatory element, lncRNAs play a critical role in coping with environmental pressure during plant growth and development. This article presents a comprehensive review on the types of plant lncRNAs, the role and mechanism of lncRNAs at different molecular levels, the coordination between lncRNA and miRNA (microRNA) in plant immune responses, the latest research progress of lncRNAs in plant growth and development, and their response to biotic and abiotic stresses. We conclude with a discussion on future direction for the elaboration of the function and mechanism of lncRNAs.
