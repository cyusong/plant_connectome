Unloading sugar from sink phloem by transporters is complex and much remains to be understood about this phenomenon in the watermelon fruit. Here, we report a novel vacuolar sugar transporter (ClVST1) identified through map-based cloning and association study, whose expression in fruit phloem is associated with accumulation of sucrose (Suc) in watermelon fruit. ClVST1<sup>97</sup> knockout lines show decreased sugar content and total biomass, whereas overexpression of ClVST1<sup>97</sup> increases Suc content. Population genomic and subcellular localization analyses strongly suggest a single-base change at the coding region of ClVST1<sup>97</sup> as a major molecular event during watermelon domestication, which results in the truncation of 45 amino acids and shifts the localization of ClVST1<sup>97</sup> to plasma membranes in sweet watermelons. Molecular, biochemical and phenotypic analyses indicate that ClVST1<sup>97</sup> is a novel sugar transporter for Suc and glucose efflux and unloading. Functional characterization of ClVST1 provides a novel strategy to increase sugar sink potency during watermelon domestication.
