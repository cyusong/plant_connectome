Carotenoids are vital phytonutrients widely recognised for their health benefits. Therefore, it is vital to thoroughly investigate the metabolic regulatory network underlying carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation to open new leads towards improving their contents in vegetables and crops. The outcome of our study defines SlWRKY35 as a positive regulator of carotenoid biosynthesis in tomato. SlWRKY35 can directly activate the expression of the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (SlDXS1) gene to reprogramme metabolism towards the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, leading to enhanced carotenoid accumulation. We also show that the master regulator SlRIN directly regulates the expression of SlWRKY35 during tomato fruit ripening. Compared with the SlLCYE overexpression lines, coexpression of SlWRKY35 and SlLCYE can further enhance lutein production in transgenic tomato fruit, indicating that SlWRKY35 represents a potential target towards designing innovative metabolic engineering strategies for carotenoid derivatives. In addition to providing new insights into the metabolic regulatory network associated with tomato fruit ripening, our data define a new tool for improving fruit content in specific carotenoid compounds.
