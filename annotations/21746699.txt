['21746699', 'Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) mediates the initial synthetic step  for the formation of glycerolipids, which act as the major components of  biological membranes and the principal stored forms of energy. GPAT6 is a member  of the Arabidopsis GPAT family, which is crucial for cutin biosynthesis in sepals  and petals. In this work, a functional analysis of GPAT6 in anther development  and plant fertility was performed. GPAT6 was highly expressed in the tapetum and  microspores during anther development. The knockout mutant, gpat6, caused a  massive reduction in seed production. This report shows that the ablation of  GPAT6 caused defective tapetum development with reduced endoplasmic reticulum  (ER) profiles in the tapetum, which largely led to the abortion of pollen grains  and defective pollen wall formation. In addition, pollen germination and pollen  tube elongation were affected in the mutant plants. Furthermore, the double  mutant analysis showed that GPAT6 and GPAT1 make joint effects on the release of  microspores from tetrads and stamen filament elongation. This work shows that  GPAT6 plays multiple roles in stamen development and fertility in Arabidopsis.', '2012 Jan', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssr057', 'Yang']
