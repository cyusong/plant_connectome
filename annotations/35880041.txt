Hongmu is a type of material with strong corrosion resistance, and its extract has wood preservative properties in a variety of environmental settings. Herein, the processing residue of <i>Dalbergia retusa</i> was used to obtain an ethanol-extract, whose anti-fungal properties and mechanism was investigated using multi-omics principles and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results show that <i>D. retusa</i> extract had a strong inhibitory effect on decaying fungus, and the inhibitory effect was dose dependent. High-throughput sequencing detected a total of 11,755 genes for transcriptome comparison. A total of 390 genes were differentially expressed, with 69 up-regulated and 321 down-regulated genes, indicating that <i>D. retusa</i> extract can significantly affect metabolic processes in decaying fungus. GC-MS results revealed that <i>D. retusa</i> extract was rich in phenols, ketones, amines, and aromatic compounds, which are likely to contribute to the excellent synergy between anti-fungal properties and anti-fungal activity (anti-fungal ability and active ingredients). In summary, this study describes the anti-fungal components in <i>D. retusa</i> extract, and our results provide a foundation for the study of their mechanism of action in this tree species.
