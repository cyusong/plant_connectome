In our recent publication, we have shown that a member of the Laccase family, <i>LACCASE2</i> (<i>LAC2)</i> acted as a negative regulator of lignin deposition in the root xylem tissue of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana. LAC2</i> messenger RNA (mRNA) level was post-transcriptionally regulated by microRNA 397b, which showed increased expression under water and phosphate deficiency, resulting in the downregulation of LAC2 expression In this report, we have investigated root growth and lignin deposition in an economically important legume crop chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i> L.) in response to natural drought in soil-grown condition. In contrast to the growth retardation of <i>Arabidopsis</i> root in mannitol-supplemented medium, chickpea root showed an increase in length in low soil moisture condition. Lignin estimation in the primary root showed an increase in lignin content, which was substantiated by staining of root xylem. Drought treatment enhanced the expression of four out of six <i>LAC</i> genes tested, while the expression of two was downregulated. Our preliminary study indicateed a molecular mechanism of lignin deposition in chickpea root xylem during drought.
