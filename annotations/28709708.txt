Comparative proteome analysis of subcellular compartments like thylakoid membranes and their associated supercomplexes can deliver important in-vivo information on the molecular basis of physiological functions which go far beyond to that what can be learnt from transcriptional-based gene expression studies. For instance, the finding that light intensity influences mainly the relative stoichiometry of subunits could be obtained only by high resolution proteome analysis. The high sensitivity of LC-ESI-MS/MS based proteome analysis allows the determination of proteins in very small subfractions along with their non-labeled semi quantitative analysis. This provides insights in the protein-protein interactions of supercomplexes that are the operative units in intact cells. Here, we have focused on functional proteome approaches for the identification of microalgal light-harvesting complex proteins in chloroplasts and the eyespot in general and in detail for those of diatoms that are exposed to varying light conditions.
