Seeds of the longcell mutant in maize (Zea mays L) have a defective-kernel phenotype: the embryo aborts at the early coleoptilar stage and the endosperm is reduced in size. Mutant embryos have severe alterations in morphogenesis. They have a suspensor-, an embryo axis- and a scutellum-like structure, but the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is not formed. Scanning electron microscopy showed that most of the cells in longcell embryos are tubular and abnormally enlarged. The level of expression of several genes involved in basic metabolism is not severely affected during early and mid embryogenesis, but storage molecule accumulation is reduced. Genes which in normal conditions are only expressed after germination, are expressed during kernel development in the longcell seeds. Mutant embryos undergo cell death in late embryogenesis. Nuclei in dying embryos are TUNEL positive, and different genes coding for hydrolytic enzymes are up-regulated. The expression of genes related to oxidative stress is also altered in longcell embryos. These results lead us to suggest that the longcell mutant may be cytokinesis-defective.
