Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in a vast number of physiologically important processes in plants, such as organ development, stress resistance, and immunity. Transduction of NO bioactivity is generally achieved by post-translational modification of proteins, with S-nitrosation of cysteine residues as the predominant form. While traditionally the subcellular location of the factors involved was of lesser importance, recent studies identified the connection between NO and transcriptional activity and thereby raised the question about the route of NO into the nuclear sphere. Identification of NO-affected transcription factors and chromatin-modifying histone deacetylases implicated the important role of NO signaling in the plant nucleus as a regulator of epigenetic mechanisms and gene transcription. Here, we discuss the relationship between NO and its directly regulated protein targets in the nuclear environment, focusing on S-nitrosated chromatin modulators and transcription factors.
