The present study was designed to serve as a comprehensive analysis of <i>Citrus sinensis</i> (<i>C. sinensis</i>) pectin acetylesterases (CsPAEs), and to assess the roles of these PAEs involved in the development of citrus bacterial canker (CBC) caused by <i>Xanthomonas citri</i> subsp. <i>citri</i> (<i>Xcc</i>) infection. A total of six <i>CsPAEs</i> were identified in the genome of <i>C. sinensis</i>, with these genes being unevenly distributed across chromosomes 3, 6, and 9, and the unassembled scaffolds. A subset of <i>CsPAEs</i> were found to be involved in responses to <i>Xcc</i> infection. In particular, <i>CsPAE2</i> was identified to be associated with such infections, as it was upregulated in CBC-susceptible variety Wanjincheng and inversely in CBC-resistant variety Calamondin. Transgenic citrus plants overexpressing <i>CsPAE2</i> were found to be more susceptible to CBC, whereas the silencing of this gene was sufficient to confer CBC resistance. Together, these findings provide evolutionary insights into and functional information about the CsPAE family. This study also suggests that <i>CsPAE2</i> is a potential candidate gene that negatively contributes to bacterial canker disease and can be used to breed CBC-resistant citrus plants.
