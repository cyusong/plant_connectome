Plants undergo extended morphogenesis. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) allows for reiterative development and the formation of new structures throughout the life of the plant. Intriguingly, the SAM produces morphologically different leaves in an age-dependent manner, a phenomenon known as heteroblasty. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the SAM produces small orbicular leaves in the juvenile phase, but gives rise to large elliptical leaves in the adult phase. Previous studies have established that a developmental decline of microRNA156 (miR156) is necessary and sufficient to trigger this leaf shape switch, although the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that the gradual increase in miR156-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors with age promotes cell growth anisotropy in the abaxial epidermis at the base of the leaf blade, evident by the formation of elongated giant cells. Time-lapse imaging and developmental genetics further revealed that the establishment of adult leaf shape is tightly associated with the longitudinal cell expansion of giant cells, accompanied by a prolonged cell proliferation phase in their vicinity. Our results thus provide a plausible cellular mechanism for heteroblasty in Arabidopsis, and contribute to our understanding of anisotropic growth in plants.
