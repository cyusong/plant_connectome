In recent years, much progress has been made with respect to the unravelling of the functions of peroxisomes in metabolism, and it is now well established that peroxisomes are indispensable organelles, especially in higher eukaryotes. Peroxisomes catalyse a number of essential metabolic functions including fatty acid beta-oxidation, ether phospholipid biosynthesis, fatty acid alpha-oxidation and glyoxylate detoxification. The involvement of peroxisomes in these metabolic pathways necessitates the transport of metabolites in and out of peroxisomes. Recently, considerable progress has been made in the characterization of metabolite transport across the peroxisomal membrane. Peroxisomes posses several specialized transport systems to transport metabolites. This is exemplified by the identification of a specific transporter for adenine nucleotides and several half-ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters which may be present as hetero- and homo-dimers. The nature of the substrates handled by the different ABC transporters is less clear. In this review we will describe the current state of knowledge of the permeability properties of the peroxisomal membrane.
