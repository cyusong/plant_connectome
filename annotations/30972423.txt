In eukaryotes, the regulated transport of mRNAs from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step in the expression of protein-coding genes, as it links nuclear mRNA synthesis with cytosolic translation. The pre-mRNAs that are synthesised by RNA polymerase II are processed by 5´-capping, splicing, and 3´-polyadenylation. The multi-subunit THO/TREX complex integrates mRNA biogenesis with their nucleocytosolic transport. Various export factors are recruited to the mRNAs during their maturation, which occurs essentially co-transcriptionally. These RNA-bound export factors ensure efficient transport of the export-competent mRNAs through nuclear pore complexes. In recent years, several factors involved in plant mRNA export have been functionally characterised. Analysis of mutant plants has demonstrated that impaired mRNA export causes defects in growth and development. Moreover, there is accumulating evidence that mRNA export can influence processes such as plant immunity, circadian regulation, and stress responses. Therefore, it is important to learn more details about the mechanism of nucleocytosolic mRNA transport in plants and its physiological significance.
