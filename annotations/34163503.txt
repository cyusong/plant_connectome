Exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA) has been known for delaying ripening in many fruit and vegetables. But the function of endogenous SA in relation to postharvest fruit performance is still unexplored. To understand the role of endogenous SA in postharvest fruit ripening of tomato, 33 tomato lines were examined for their endogenous SA content, membrane stability index (MSI), and shelf life (SL) at turning and red stages of tomato fruit ripening. Six tomato lines having contrasting shelf lives from these categories were subjected further for ethylene (ET) evolution, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACO), polygalacturonase (PG), pectin methyl esterase (PME), antioxidant assays and lipid peroxidation. It was found that high endogenous SA has a direct association with low ET evolution, which leads to the high SL of fruit. High lycopene content was also found to be correlated with high SA. Total antioxidants, PG, and PME decreased and lipid peroxidation increased from turning to red stage of tomato fruit development. Furthermore, these lines were subjected to expression analysis for SA biosynthesis enzymes <i>viz. Solanum lycopersicum Isochorismate Synthase</i> (<i>SlICS</i>) and <i>SlPAL</i>. Real-time PCR data revealed that high SL lines have high <i>SlPAL4</i> expression and low SL lines have high <i>SlPAL6</i> expression. Based on the results obtained in this study, it was concluded that endogenous SA regulates ET evolution and SL with the aid of the antioxidative defense system, and <i>SlPAL4</i> and <i>SlPAL6</i> genes play significant but opposite roles during fruit ripening.
