Biotrophic pathogens, such as wheat rust fungi, survive on nutrients derived from host cells. Sugar appears to be the major carbon source transferred from host cells to various fungal pathogens; however, the molecular mechanism by which host sugar transporters are manipulated by fungal pathogens for nutrient uptake is poorly understood. TaSTP6, a sugar transporter protein in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), was previously shown to exhibit enhanced expression in leaves upon infection by <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>), the causal agent of wheat stripe rust. In this study, we found that <i>Pst</i> infection caused increased accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) and that application of exogenous ABA significantly enhanced <i>TaSTP6</i> expression. Moreover, knockdown of <i>TaSTP6</i> expression by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing reduced wheat susceptibility to the <i>Pst</i> pathotype CYR31, suggesting that <i>TaSTP6</i> expression upregulation contributes to <i>Pst</i> host sugar acquisition. Consistent with this, <i>TaSTP6</i> overexpression in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) promoted plant susceptibility to powdery mildew and led to increased Glc accumulation in the leaves. Functional complementation assays in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> showed that TaSTP6 has broad substrate specificity, indicating that TaSTP6 is an active sugar transporter. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that TaSTP6 localizes to the plasma membrane. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments revealed that TaSTP6 undergoes oligomerization. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>Pst</i> stimulates ABA biosynthesis in host cells and thereby upregulates <i>TaSTP6</i> expression, which increases sugar supply and promotes fungal infection.
