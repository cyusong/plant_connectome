Interactions between individual plant pathogens and their environment have been described many times. However, the relative contribution of different environmental parameters as controls of pathogen communities remains largely unknown. Here we investigate the importance of environmental factors, including geomorphology, climate, land use, soil and plant community composition, for a broad range of aboveground and belowground fungal, oomycete and bacterial plant pathogens. We found that plant community composition is the main driver of the composition and richness of plant pathogens after taking into account all other tested parameters, especially those related to climate and soil. In the face of future changes in climate and land use, our results suggest that changes in plant pathogen community composition and richness will primarily be mediated through changes in plant communities, rather than the direct effects of climate or soils.
