['32757028', 'The RING-type E3 ligase AtPPRT3 participates in the plant ABA responding as a  positive regulator. E3 ubiquitin ligase, alike of classic plant stress resistance  proteins, plays a vital role in regulating the degradation of stress-related  proteins. In this study, we investigated the function of the RING-type E3  ubiquitin ligase AtPPRT3 in the ABA signaling pathway. AtPPRT3, located in the  endoplasmic reticulum membrane, is involved in ABA signaling. The transcriptional  expression of AtPPRT3 was induced by ABA, and the promoter region upstream of  AtPPRT3 contains the ABA-responsive element (ABRE). Additionally, the  beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene driven by the AtPPRT3 promoter was up-regulated in  transgenic plants after ABA treated. We obtained AtPPRT3 function-deficient  mutants atpprt3-1, atpprt3-2, and AtPPRT3 over-expressing lines (OE4 and OE5). In  this study, atpprt3-1 and atpprt3-2 were less sensitive to exogenous ABA compared  to Col-0, whereas OE4 and OE5 were more sensitive. Moreover, AtPPRT3 promotes  ABA-mediated stomatal closure and inhibits water loss in Arabidopsis thaliana.  After exogenous ABA treated, the transcriptional expression levels of AtDREB2A,  AtKIN1, AtRD29A, AtERD10 and AtRD29B were up-regulated to greater extents in OEs  and lower extents in atpprt3-1 and atpprt3-2 compared to Col-0. These results  suggest that AtPPRT3 positively regulates ABA signaling in A. thaliana.', '2020 Nov', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-020-02575-3', 'ORCID:']
