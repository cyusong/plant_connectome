Plants experience changes in light intensity and quality due to variations in solar angle and shading from clouds and overlapping leaves. Stomatal opening to increasing irradiance is often an order of magnitude slower than photosynthetic responses, which can result in CO2 diffusional limitations on leaf photosynthesis, as well as unnecessary water loss when stomata continue to open after photosynthesis has reached saturation. Stomatal opening to light is driven by two distinct pathways; the 'red' or photosynthetic response that occurs at high fluence rates and saturates with photosynthesis, and is thought to be the main mechanism that coordinates stomatal behaviour with photosynthesis; and the guard cell-specific 'blue' light response that saturates at low fluence rates, and is often considered independent of photosynthesis, and important for early morning stomatal opening. Here we review the literature on these complicated signal transduction pathways and osmoregulatory processes in guard cells that are influenced by the light environment. We discuss the possibility of tuning the sensitivity and magnitude of stomatal response to blue light which potentially represents a novel target to develop ideotypes with the 'ideal' balance between carbon gain, evaporative cooling, and maintenance of hydraulic status that is crucial for maximizing crop performance and productivity.
