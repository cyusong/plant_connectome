The tropical forage legume Stylosanthes humilis is naturally distributed in the acidic soils of the tropics. However, data concerning the role of low soil pH in the control of S. humilis seed germination remains limited. Recently, we have demonstrated that acidic soil triggers increased ethylene production during germination of S. humilis seeds, concomitantly with higher root penetration into the soil. Our finding points an important role of low soil pH as a signal allowing penetration of root in the soil through interaction with the ethylene signalling pathway. Herein, we discuss how low soil pH induces changes on seed hormonal physiology.
