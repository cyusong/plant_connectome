The myeloblastosis (MYB) transcription factor superfamily is the largest transcription factor family in plants, playing different roles during stress response. However, abiotic stress-responsive MYB transcription factors have not been systematically studied in cassava (Manihot esculenta), an important tropical tuber root crop. In this study, we used a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to predict 299 putative MeMYB genes in the cassava genome. Under drought and cold stresses, many MeMYB genes exhibited different expression patterns in cassava leaves, indicating that these genes might play a role in abiotic stress responses. We found that several stress-responsive MeMYB genes responded to abscisic acid (ABA) in cassava leaves. We characterize four MeMYBs, namely MeMYB1, MeMYB2, MeMYB4, and MeMYB9, as R2R3-MYB transcription factors. Furthermore, RNAi-driven repression of MeMYB2 resulted in drought and cold tolerance in transgenic cassava. Gene expression assays in wild-type and MeMYB2-RNAi cassava plants revealed that MeMYB2 may affect other MeMYBs as well as MeWRKYs under drought and cold stress, suggesting crosstalk between MYB and WRKY family genes under stress conditions in cassava.
