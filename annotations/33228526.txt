Gnetum is an economically important tropical and subtropical gymnosperm genus with various dietary, industrial and medicinal uses. Many carbohydrates, proteins and fibers accumulate during the ripening of Gnetum seeds. However, the molecular mechanisms related to this process remain unknown. We therefore assembled a full-length transcriptome from immature and mature G. luofuense seeds using PacBio sequencing reads. We identified a total of 5726 novel genes, 9061 alternative splicing events, 3551 lncRNAs, 2160 transcription factors, and we found that 8512 genes possessed at least one poly(A) site. In addition, gene expression comparisons of six transcriptomes generated by Illumina sequencing showed that 14,323 genes were differentially expressed from an immature stage to a mature stage with 7891 genes upregulated and 6432 genes downregulated. The expression of 14 differentially expressed transcription factors from the MADS-box, Aux/IAA and bHLH families was validated by qRT-PCR, suggesting that they may have important roles in seed ripening of G. luofuense. These findings provide a valuable molecular resource for understanding seed development of gymnosperms.
