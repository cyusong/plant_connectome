Photorespiration coupled with CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation is thought to act as a defense system against photoinhibition caused by osmotic stress. In the present study, we examined whether such a mechanism is operative for the protection of photosystem I (PSI) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) including transgenic plants with decreased and increased Rubisco content (<i>RBCS</i>-antisense and <i>RBCS</i>-sense plants, respectively). All plants were hydroponically grown and moderate osmotic stress was imposed using hydroponic culture solutions containing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) at 16% or 20% (w/v) for 2 d. In wild-type plants, the rates of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation (<i>A</i>) were significantly decreased by the PEG treatment, whereas the photorespiration activity estimated from the rates of electron transport in photosystem II (PSII) and <i>A</i> were not affected. The maximal quantum efficiency of PSII (<i>F</i> <sub>v</sub>/<i>F</i> <sub>m</sub>) and the maximal activity of PSI (<i>P</i> <sub>m</sub>) were also not affected. In <i>RBCS</i>-antisense plants, <i>A</i> and the estimated photorespiration activity were considerably lower than those in wild-type plants in the presence or absence of the PEG treatment. <i>P</i> <sub>m</sub> and both <i>F</i> <sub>v</sub>/<i>F</i> <sub>m</sub> and <i>P</i> <sub>m</sub> decreased in the 16% PEG-treated and 20% PEG-treated <i>RBCS</i>-antisense plants, respectively. Thus, the decrease in Rubisco content led to the photoinhibition of PSI and PSII, indicating the importance of photorespiration coupled with CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation for the protection of PSI from moderate PEG-induced osmotic stress. It was also shown that PSI was more sensitive to osmotic stress than PSII. In the PEG-treated wild-type and <i>RBCS</i>-antisense plants, osmotic-stress responses of the photosynthetic electron transport reactions upstream of PSI led to the oxidation of P700, which is thought to prevent PSI from over-reduction. Although such a defense system operated, it was not sufficient for the protection of PSI in <i>RBCS</i>-antisense plants. In addition, there were no large differences in the parameters measured between wild-type and <i>RBCS</i>-sense plants, as overproduction of Rubisco did not increase photorespiration activity.
