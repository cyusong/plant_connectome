Full-sized ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters of the G subfamily (ABCG) are considered to be essential components of the plant immune system. These proteins have been proposed to be implicated in the active transmembrane transport of various secondary metabolites. Despite the importance of ABCG-based transport for plant-microbe interactions, these proteins are still poorly recognized in legumes. The experiments described here demonstrated that the level of Medicago truncatula ABCG10 (MtABCG10) mRNA was elevated following application of fungal oligosaccharides to plant roots. Spatial expression pattern analysis with a reporter gene revealed that the MtABCG10 promoter was active in various organs, mostly within their vascular tissues. The corresponding protein was located in the plasma membrane. Silencing of MtABCG10 in hairy roots resulted in lower accumulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway-derived medicarpin and its precursors. PCR-based experiments indicated that infection with Fusarium oxysporum, a root-infecting pathogen, progressed faster in MtABCG10-silenced composite plants (consisting of wild-type shoots on transgenic roots) than in the corresponding controls. Based on the presented data, it is proposed that in Medicago, full-sized ABCG transporters might modulate isoflavonoid levels during the defence response associated with de novo synthesis of phytoalexins.
