Most of life's energy comes from sunlight, and thus, photosynthesis underpins the survival of virtually all life forms. The light-driven electron transfer at photosystem I (PSI) is certainly the most important generator of reducing power at the cellular level and thereby largely determines the global amount of enthalpy in living systems (Nelson 2011). The PSI is a light-driven plastocyanin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, which is embedded into thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic photosynthetic organism. Structural determination of complexes of the photosynthetic machinery is vital for the understanding of its mode of action. Here, we describe new structural and functional insights into PSI and associated light-harvesting proteins, with a focus on the plasticity of PSI.
