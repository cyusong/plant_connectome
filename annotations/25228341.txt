['25228341', 'The timely transition of vegetative to reproductive development is coordinated  through quantitative regulation of floral pathway genes in response to  physiological and environmental cues. Here, we show that the circadian-controlled  expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana floral transition regulators FLOWERING  LOCUS T (FT) and CONSTANS (CO) is antiphasic to that of BBX19, a transcription  factor with two B-Box motifs. Diminished expression of BBX19 by RNA interference  accelerates flowering, and constitutive expression of BBX19 delays flowering  under inductive photoperiods. This delay is not accompanied by the alteration of  CO expression levels but rather by a reduction of transcript levels of FT and the  FT-regulated genes SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1, LEAFY, and  FRUITFUL. Similar to CO, BBX19 is expressed in vasculature. BBX19 and CO  colocalize in the nucleus and interact physically in vivo. In transient assays,  coinfiltration of 10-fold more CO overcomes the BBX19-mediated repression of FT  activation. Substitution of the conserved Cys-25 to Ser in the BBX19 Box1 motif  abolishes the BBX19-CO interaction and eliminates the negative regulation of  flowering time, while the analogous C76S substitution in the Box2 motif is  ineffective. Together, these results implicate BBX19 as a circadian clock output  that depletes the active CO pool to accurately monitor daylength and precisely  time FT expression.', '2014 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.130252', 'Dehesh']
