Sterols play important roles in plant growth, including embryogenesis, cell expansion, vascular differentiation, male fertility, and endocytosis. Sterols become functional only after removal of the 2 methyl groups at C-4. There are 2 distinct sterol C-4-methyl oxidase (SMO) families in higher plants, SMO1 and SMO2, which contain 3 and 2 isoforms, respectively, involving in the removal of the first and second C4 methyl groups during sterols biosynthesis. In a recent study we showed that single smo2-1 and smo2-2 mutants displayed no significant phenotype, while smo2-1 smo2-2 double mutant was embryonic lethal. smo2-1/+ smo2-2 and smo2-1 smo2-2/+ mutants showed defect in abnormal embryo patterning and smo2-1 smo2-2/+ mutant displayed dwarf phenotype. In this mini-review, we summarize the functions and regulatory mechanisms of SMO2-1 and SMO2-2 in embryo and postembryonic development.
