A thermo-sensitive chlorophyll deficient mutant was isolated from more than 15,000 transgenic rice lines. The mutant displayed normal phenotype at 23 degrees C or lower temperature (permissive temperature). However, when grown at 26 degrees C or higher (nonpermissive temperature) the plant exhibited an abnormal phenotype characterized by yellow green leaves. Genetic analysis revealed that a single nuclear-encoded recessive gene is responsible for the mutation, which is tentatively designed as cde1(t) (chlorophyll deficient 1, temporally). PCR analysis and hygromycin resistance assay indicated the mutation was not caused by T-DNA insertion. To isolate the cde1(t) gene, a map-based cloning strategy was employed and 15 new markers (five SSR and ten InDels markers) were developed. A high-resolution physical map of the chromosomal region around the cde1(t) gene was made using F(2) and F(3) population consisting of 1,858 mutant individuals. Finally, the cde1(t) gene was mapped in 7.5 kb region between marker ID10 and marker ID11 on chromosome 2. Sequence analysis revealed only one candidate gene, OsGluRS, in the 7.5 kb region. Cloning and sequencing of the target region from the cde1(t) mutant showed that a missense mutation occurred in the mutant. So the OsGluRS gene (TIGR locus Os02 g02860) which encode glutamyl-tRNA synthetase was identified as the Cde1(t) gene.
