Flowering Locus C (FLC) is a key floral repressor that precisely controls flowering time. The role of FLC has been extensively studied at the transcriptional level using molecular biological and epigenetic approaches. However, how FLC functions and how its stability is controlled at the post-translational level are only beginning to be understood. Recent studies show that various post-translational modifications (PTMs) control the stability and activity of FLC. In this review, we focus on three types of PTMs that regulate FLC function: phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation. This report should serve as a model to guide post-translational studies of other important floral regulators.
