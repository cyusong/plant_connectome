['12837946', 'The timing of flowering initiation depends on the balanced expression of a  complex network of genes that are regulated by both endogenous and environmental  factors. We showed previously that mutations at the EARLY BOLTING IN SHORT DAYS  (EBS) locus of Arabidopsis result in an acceleration of flowering, especially in  noninductive photoperiods (short days), and other phenotypic anomalies. We have  identified the EBS gene and demonstrate that it encodes a nuclear protein that  contains a bromoadjacent homology domain and a plant homeodomain Zn finger. Both  types of motif are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions and occur in  transcriptional regulators involved in chromatin remodeling, suggesting that EBS  is part of a transcriptional repressor complex that modulates chromatin structure  and is required to repress the initiation of flowering in short days.  Overexpression of EBS has phenotypic effects similar to those of recessive ebs  mutations, suggesting that both might disrupt the formation of protein complexes  that contain EBS. Analysis of the expression of flowering-time genes in ebs  mutants and in EBS-overexpressing plants indicates that EBS participates in the  regulation of flowering time by specifically repressing the expression of FT, a  key gene in the integration of floral promotion pathways in Arabidopsis.', '2003 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.012153', 'Coupland']
