CsrA, an RNA-binding protein, binds to target transcripts and alters their translation or stability. In <i>Erwinia amylovora,</i> CsrA positively regulates the expression of type III secretion system (T3SS), exopolysaccharide amylovoran, and motility. In this study, the global effect of CsrA and its noncoding small RNA (ncsRNA) <i>csrB</i> in <i>E. amylovora</i> was determined by RNA-seq, and potential molecular mechanisms of CsrA-dependent virulence regulation were examined. Transcriptomic analyses under the T3SS-inducing condition revealed that mutation in the <i>csrA</i> gene led to differential expression of more than 20% of genes in the genome. Among them, T3SS genes and those required for cell growth and viability were significantly downregulated. On the other hand, the <i>csrB</i> mutant exhibited significant upregulation of most major virulence genes, suggesting an antagonistic effect of <i>csrB</i> on CsrA targets. Direct interaction between CsrA protein and <i>csrB</i> was further confirmed through the RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (REMSA). However, no direct interaction between CsrA and <i>hrpL</i> and <i>hrpS</i> transcripts was detected, suggesting that HrpL and HrpS are not targets of CsrA, whereas three CsrA targets (<i>relA</i>, <i>rcsB</i>, and <i>flhD</i>) were identified and confirmed by REMSA, site-directed mutagenesis, and LacZ reporter gene assays. These findings might partially explain how CsrA positively controls <i>E. amylovora</i> virulence by targeting major regulators at the posttranscriptional level.
