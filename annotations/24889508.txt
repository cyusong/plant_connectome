['24889508', 'PETAL LOSS (PTL) is a trihelix transcription factor that represses growth,  especially between sepal primordia. As one of 30 trihelix proteins in  Arabidopsis, it falls in the GT2 clade with duplicated trihelix DNA-binding  domains and a long alpha-helical central domain. PTL orthologs occur in all  angiosperm genomes examined except grasses, and sequence comparisons reveal that  there are two further short conserved domains at each end. GT2 itself carries two  nuclear localization sequences, but PTL has an additional nuclear localization  sequence (NLS). We show that PTL can act as a transcriptional activator in yeast  and in planta, with the latter tested by two different functional assays.  Specific deletions revealed that the activation region is C-terminal.  Site-directed mutagenesis of the DNA-binding domains has shown that a conserved  tryptophan and two downstream acidic amino acids in the second trihelix,  predicted to promote folding, are each required for PTL function. Also, three  basic residues in the third helix, near the DNA interaction sites, support its  function. PTL was found to dimerize in yeast. This was confirmed and extended by  jointly expressing differentially tagged forms of PTL in a transient expression  system in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Cytoplasmic PTL (with mutant NLS  sequences) was carried into the nucleus upon binding with nuclear-localized PTL,  providing each partner carried intact central domains. As this 90-amino acid  domain is conserved in most trihelix family members, it seems likely that they  all function in dimeric form.', '2014 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12574', 'Smyth']
