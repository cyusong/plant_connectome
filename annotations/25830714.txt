Heavy metal pollution has became one of the realistic matters of globality. Previous reports indicated that heavy metals could significantly inhibit pollen germination and tube growth. In the present study, comparative studies on the effects of different heavy metals (As, Hg, Cd, Cr and Cu) on in-vitro picea wilsonii pollen germination and tube growth were carried out. Microscopic evaluation revealed that different heavy metals had various degree of toxicity on P. wilsonii pollen tube development. As showed the most toxic effects on pollen germination, which was followed by Hg and Cd, while Cr and Cu showed relatively lower toxicity. Besides, pollen tubes showed varying shapes in response to different heavy metal stress. Pollen tubes treated with Cd, Hg and As were usually characterized by irregularly increasing diameters and swelling tips with distinct cytoplasimic vacuolation. On the other hand, except for the slightly increased diameters, no obvious abnormal shape were observed in tubes treated with Cr or Cu. Lyso-Tracker Green staining indicated that only Cd-treated pollen tubes showed numerous vacuole-like acidic organelles, though cytoplasmic vacuolization were also observed in pollen tubes treated with Hg and A. In brief, our data indicated that different heavy metals have various effects on Picea wilsonii pollen germination and tube growth, and that in-vitro pollen culture might be used as a competent system for biomonitoring of air pollution.
