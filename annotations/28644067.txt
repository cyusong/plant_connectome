Plant border cells are specialized cells derived from the root cap with roles in the biomechanics of root growth and in forming a barrier against pathogens. The mechanism of highly localized cell separation which is essential for their release to the environment is little understood. Here I present in situ analysis of Brachypodium distachyon, a model organism for grasses which possess type II primary cell walls poor in pectin content. Results suggest similarity in spatial dynamics of pectic homogalacturonan during dicot and monocot border cell release. Integration of observations from different species leads to the hypothesis that this process most likely does not involve degradation of cell wall material but rather uses unique cell wall structural and compositional means enabling both the rigidity of the root cap as well as detachability of given cells on its surface.
