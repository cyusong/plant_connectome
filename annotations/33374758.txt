The NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) family of proteins is one of the largest plant-specific transcription factor (TF) families and its members play varied roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. In recent years, NAC TFs have been demonstrated to participate in crop-pathogen interactions, as positive or negative regulators of the downstream defense-related genes. NAC TFs link signaling pathways between plant hormones, including salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), and abscisic acid (ABA), or other signals, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), to regulate the resistance against pathogens. Remarkably, NAC TFs can also contribute to hypersensitive response and stomatal immunity or can be hijacked as virulence targets of pathogen effectors. Here, we review recent progress in understanding the structure, biological functions and signaling networks of NAC TFs in response to pathogens in several main food crops, such as rice, wheat, barley, and tomato, and explore the directions needed to further elucidate the function and mechanisms of these key signaling molecules.
