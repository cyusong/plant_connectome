['17148605', 'Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) occur in the inner mitochondrial membrane and  dissipate the proton gradient across this membrane that is normally used for ATP  synthesis. Although the catalytic function and regulation of plant UCPs have been  described, the physiological purpose of UCP in plants has not been established.  Here, biochemical and physiological analyses of an insertional knockout of one of  the Arabidopsis UCP genes (AtUCP1) are presented that resolve this issue. Absence  of UCP1 results in localized oxidative stress but does not impair the ability of  the plant to withstand a wide range of abiotic stresses. However, absence of UCP1  results in a photosynthetic phenotype. Specifically there is a restriction in  photorespiration with a decrease in the rate of oxidation of photorespiratory  glycine in the mitochondrion. This change leads to an associated reduced  photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate. Collectively, these results suggest that  the main physiological role of UCP1 in Arabidopsis leaves is related to  maintaining the redox poise of the mitochondrial electron transport chain to  facilitate photosynthetic metabolism.', '2006 Dec 19', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0607751103', 'Fernie']
