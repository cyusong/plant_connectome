The nuclear envelope (NE) is a double membrane system enclosing the genome of eukaryotes. Besides nuclear pore proteins, which form channels at the NE, nuclear membranes are populated by a collection of NE proteins that perform various cellular functions. However, in contrast to well-conserved nuclear pore proteins, known NE proteins share little homology between opisthokonts and plants. Recent studies on NE protein complexes formed by Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN) and Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 Homology (KASH) proteins have advanced our understanding of plant NE proteins and revealed their function in anchoring other proteins at the NE, nuclear shape determination, nuclear positioning, anti-pathogen defence, root development, and meiotic chromosome organization. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of plant SUN, KASH, and other related NE proteins, and compare their function with the opisthokont counterparts.
