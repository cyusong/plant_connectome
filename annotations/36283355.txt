The mechanisms by which plants sense the pH of their environment remained largely obscure. A recent study revealed that plants employ an interlaced bimodal peptide-receptor system to monitor the pH of the root apoplast, a readout that prioritizes either growth or defense.

Peptide-receptor system: !monitors! root apoplast pH 
bimodal system: !prioritizes! growth or defense
