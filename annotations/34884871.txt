Tomato clade species (<i>Solanum</i> sect. <i>Lycopersicon</i>) display multiple interspecific reproductive barriers (IRBs). Some IRBs conform to the SI x SC rule, which describes unilateral incompatibility (UI) where pollen from SC species is rejected on SI species' pistils, but reciprocal pollinations are successful. However, SC x SC UI also exists, offering opportunities to identify factors that contribute to S-RNase-independent IRBs. For instance, SC <i>Solanum pennellii</i> LA0716 pistils only permit SC <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> pollen tubes to penetrate to the top third of the pistil, while <i>S. pennellii</i> pollen penetrates to <i>S. lycopersicum</i> ovaries. We identified candidate <i>S. pennellii</i> LA0716 pistil barrier genes based on expression profiles and published results. CRISPR/Cas9 mutants were created in eight candidate genes, and mutants were assessed for changes in <i>S. lycopersicum</i> pollen tube growth. Mutants in a gene designated <i>Defective in Induced Resistance 1-like</i> (<i>SpDIR1L</i>), which encodes a small cysteine-rich protein, permitted <i>S. lycopersicum</i> pollen tubes to grow to the bottom third of the style. We show that SpDIR1L protein accumulation correlates with IRB strength and that species with weak or no IRBs toward <i>S. lycopersicum</i> pollen share a 150 bp deletion in the upstream region of <i>SpDIR1L</i>. These results suggest that <i>SpDIR1L</i> contributes to an <i>S</i>-RNase-independent IRB.
