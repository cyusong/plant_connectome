['7505443', 'Whereas vertebrates and fungi synthesize sterols from epoxysqualene through the  intermediate lanosterol, plants cyclize epoxysqualene to cycloartenol as the  initial sterol. We report the cloning and characterization of CAS1, an  Arabidopsis thaliana gene encoding cycloartenol synthase [(S)-2,3-epoxysqualene  mutase (cyclizing, cycloartenol forming), EC 5.4.99.8]. A yeast mutant lacking  lanosterol synthase [(S)-2,3-epoxysqualene mutase (cyclizing, lanosterol  forming), EC 5.4.99.7] was transformed with an A. thaliana cDNA yeast expression  library, and colonies were assayed for epoxysqualene mutase activity by  thin-layer chromatography. One out of approximately 10,000 transformants produced  a homogenate that cyclized 2,3-epoxysqualene to the plant sterol cycloartenol.  This activity was shown to be plasmid dependent. The plasmid insert contains a  2277-bp open reading frame capable of encoding an 86-kDa protein with significant  homology to lanosterol synthase from Candida albicans and squalene-hopene cyclase  (EC 5.4.99.-) from Bacillus acidocalcarius. The method used to clone this gene  should be generally applicable to genes responsible for secondary metabolite  biosynthesis.', '1993 Dec 15', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.90.24.11628', 'Bartel']
