Stomata are crucial valves coordinating the fixation of carbon dioxide by photosynthesis and water loss through leaf transpiration. Phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs) are negative regulators of red light responses that belong to the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors. Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) PIF family gene OsPIL15 acts as a negative regulator of stomatal aperture to control transpiration in rice. OsPIL15 reduces stomatal aperture by activating rice ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 5 (OsABI5), which encodes a critical positive regulator of ABSCISIC ACID (ABA) signaling in rice. Moreover, OsPIL15 interacts with the NIGT1/HRS1/HHO family transcription factor rice HRS1 HOMOLOG 3 (OsHHO3) to possibly enhance the regulation of stomatal aperture. Notably, we discovered that the maize (Zea mays) PIF family genes ZmPIF1 and ZmPIF3, which are homologous to OsPIL15, are also involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture in maize, indicating that PIF-mediated regulation of stomatal aperture may be conserved in the plant lineage. Our findings explain the molecular mechanism by which PIFs play a role in red-light-mediated stomatal opening, and demonstrate that PIFs regulate stomatal aperture by coordinating the red light and ABA signaling pathways.
