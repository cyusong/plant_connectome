Paraoxonase 1 gene (<i>PON1</i>) polymorphisms and dietary vegetable and fruit intake are both established determinants of ischemic stroke (IS). However, little is known about whether these factors jointly influence the risk of IS. We analyzed the main effects of <i>PON1</i>, as well as the interactions between <i>PON1</i> and dietary vegetable or fruit intake with the risk of total IS and its subtypes in a family-based case-control study conducted among 2158 Chinese participants (1007 IS cases and 1151 IS-free controls) from 918 families. Conditional logistic regression models, with each family as a stratum, were used to examine the association between rs662 and IS. Gene-diet interactions were tested by including a cross-product term of dietary vegetable or fruit intake by rs662_G allele count in the models. Each copy of the <i>PON1</i> rs662_G allele was associated with 28% higher risk of total IS (<i>p</i> = 0.008) and 32% higher risk of large artery atherosclerosis subtype (LAA) (<i>p</i> = 0.01). We observed an interaction between rs662 and vegetable intake for both total IS (<i>p</i> = 0.006) and LAA (<i>p</i> = 0.02) after adjustment for covariates. Individuals who carry the rs662_A allele may benefit to a greater extent from intake of vegetables and thus be more effectively protected from ischemic stroke, whereas carriers of the G allele may still remain at greater risk for ischemic stroke due to their genetic backgrounds even when they consume a high level of vegetables. More studies are needed to replicate our findings among other populations.
