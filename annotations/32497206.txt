Alternative electron pathways contribute to regulation of photosynthetic light reactions to adjust to metabolic demands in dynamic environments. The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex mediates the cyclic electron transport pathway around PSI in different cyanobacteria, algae, and plant species, but it is not fully conserved in all photosynthetic organisms. In order to assess how the physiological role of this complex changed during plant evolution, we isolated Physcomitrella patens lines knocked out for the NDHM gene that encodes a subunit fundamental for the activity of the complex. ndhm knockout mosses indicated high PSI acceptor side limitation upon abrupt changes in illumination. In P. patens, pseudo-cyclic electron transport mediated by flavodiiron proteins (FLVs) was also shown to prevent PSI over-reduction in plants exposed to light fluctuations. flva ndhm double knockout mosses had altered photosynthetic performance and growth defects under fluctuating light compared with the wild type and single knockout mutants. The results showed that while the contribution of NDH to electron transport is minor compared with FLV, NDH still participates in modulating photosynthetic activity, and it is critical to avoid PSI photoinhibition, especially when FLVs are inactive. The functional overlap between NDH- and FLV-dependent electron transport supports PSI activity and prevents its photoinhibition under light variations.
