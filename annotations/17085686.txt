We previously showed that Arabidopsis thaliana histone acetyltransferase TAF1/HAF2 is required for the light regulation of growth and gene expression, and we show here that histone acetyltransferase GCN5 and histone deacetylase HD1/HDA19 are also involved in such regulation. Mutation of GCN5 resulted in a long-hypocotyl phenotype and reduced light-inducible gene expression, whereas mutation of HD1 induced opposite effects. The double mutant gcn5 hd1 restored a normal photomorphogenic phenotype. By contrast, the double mutant gcn5 taf1 resulted in further loss of light-regulated gene expression. gcn5 reduced acetylation of histones H3 and H4, mostly on the core promoter regions, whereas hd1 increased acetylation on both core and more upstream promoter regions. GCN5 and TAF1 were both required for H3K9, H3K27, and H4K12 acetylation on the target promoters, but H3K14 acetylation was dependent only on GCN5. Interestingly, gcn5 taf1 had a cumulative effect mainly on H3K9 acetylation. On the other hand, hd1 induced increased acetylation on H3K9, H3K27, H4K5, and H4K8. GCN5 was also shown to be directly associated with the light-responsive promoters. These results suggest that acetylation of specific histone Lys residues, regulated by GCN5, TAF1, and HD1, is required for light-regulated gene expression.
