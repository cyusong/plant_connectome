<i>Xylella fastidiosa</i> is a worldwide multihost pathogen that causes diseases in different crops. It is considered a new global threat and substantial efforts have been made in order to identify sources of resistance. Indeed, many genes have been associated with resistance to <i>X. fastidiosa</i>, but without functional validation. Here, we describe a <i>C. reticulata</i> gene homologous to the transcriptional factor RAP2.2 from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that increases resistance to citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC). This gene was previously detected in <i>C. reticulata</i> challenged with <i>X. fastidiosa</i>. Bioinformatics analysis together with subcellular localization and auto-activation assays indicated that <i>RAP2.2</i> from <i>C. reticulata</i> (<i>CrRAP2.</i>2) is a transcriptional factor orthologous to <i>AtRAP2.2</i>. Thus, we used <i>A. thaliana</i> as a model host to evaluate the functional role of <i>CrRAP2.2</i> in <i>X. fastidiosa</i> resistance. The inoculation of <i>X. fastidiosa</i> in the <i>A. thaliana rap2.2</i> mutant resulted in a larger bacterial population, which was complemented by <i>CrRAP2.2</i>. In addition, symptoms of anthocyanin accumulation were higher in the mutant, whose phenotype was restored by <i>CrRAP2.2</i>, indicating that they have conserved functions in plant defense response. We therefore transformed <i>C. sinensis</i> with <i>CrRAP2.2</i> and verified a positive correlation between CVC resistance and gene expression in transgenic lines. This is the first study using <i>A. thaliana</i> as model host that characterizes the function of a gene related to <i>X. fastidiosa</i> defense response and its application in genetic engineering to obtain citrus resistance to CVC.
