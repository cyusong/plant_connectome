['12481062', 'AtAMT2 is an ammonium transporter that is only distantly related to the five  members of the AtAMT1 family of high-affinity ammonium transporters in  Arabidopsis. The short-lived radioactive ion (13)NH(4)(+) was used to show that  AtAMT2, expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), is a high-affinity  transporter with a K(m) for ammonium of about 20 microM. Changes in external pH  between 5.0 and 7.5 had little effect on the K(m) for ammonium, indicating that  NH(4)(+), not NH(3), is the substrate for AtAMT2. The AtAMT2 gene was expressed  in all organs of Arabidopsis and was subject to nitrogen (N) regulation, at least  in roots where expression was partially repressed by high concentrations of  ammonium nitrate and derepressed in the absence of external N. Although  expression of AtAMT2 in shoots responded little to changes in root N status,  transcript levels in leaves declined under high CO(2) conditions. Transient  expression of an AtAMT2-green fluorescent protein fusion protein in Arabidopsis  leaf epidermal cells indicated a plasma membrane location for the AtAMT2 protein.  Thus, AtAMT2 is likely to play a significant role in moving ammonium between the  apoplast and symplast of cells throughout the plant. However, a dramatic  reduction in the level of AtAMT2 transcript brought about by dsRNA interference  with gene expression had no obvious effect on plant growth or development, under  the conditions tested.', '2002 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.008599', 'Udvardi']
