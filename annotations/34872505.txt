Aegilops geniculata Roth is closely related to common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and is a valuable genetic resource for improvement of wheat. In this study, the W19513 line was derived from the BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>10</sub> progeny of a cross between wheat 'Chinese Spring' and Ae. geniculata SY159. Cytological examination showed that W19513 contained 44 chromosomes. Twenty-two bivalents were formed at the first meiotic metaphase I in the pollen mother cellsand the chromosomes were evenly distributed to opposite poles at meiotic anaphase I. Genomic in situ hybridization demonstrated that W19513 carried a pair of alien chromosomes from the M genome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed detection of variation in chromosomes 4A and 6B. Functional molecular marker analysis using expressed sequence tag-sequence-tagged site and PCR-based landmark unique gene primers revealed that the alien gene belonged to the third homologous group. The marker analysis confirmed that the alien chromosome pair was 3M<sup>g</sup>. In addition, to further explore the molecular marker specificity of chromosome 3M<sup>g</sup>, based on the specific locus amplified fragment sequencing technique, molecular markers specific for W19513 were developed with efficiencies of up to 47.66%. The W19513 line was inoculated with the physiological race E09 of powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) at the seedling stage and showed moderate resistance. Field inoculation with a mixture of the races CYR31, CYR32, CYR33, and CYR34 of the stripe rust fungus (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. triticii) revealed that the line W19513 showed strong resistance. This study provides a foundation for use of the line W19513 in future genetic research and wheat improvement.
