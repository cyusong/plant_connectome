The precise regulation of gibberellin (GA) metabolism and signaling is essential for plant development and environmental responses. Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, such as histone modification, noncoding RNA-mediated regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation, are emerging as important means of fine-tuning gene expression. Recent studies have significantly improved our understanding of the relationships between epigenetic regulation and GA metabolism and signaling. Here, we summarize the molecular mechanisms by which epigenetic modifications affect GA metabolism and signaling pathways and provide new insight into an unfolding avenue of research related to the epigenetic regulation of GA pathways.
