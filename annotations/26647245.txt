The microRNA156 (miR156)-modulated SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) is involved in diverse biological processes that include growth, development and metabolism. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis miR156 and SPL3 as regulators play important roles in phosphate (Pi) deficiency response. MiR156 was induced during Pi starvation whereas SPL3 expression was repressed. Phenotypes of reduced rhizosphere acidification and decreased anthocyanin accumulation were observed in 35S:MIM156 (via target mimicry) transgenic plants under Pi deficiency. The content and uptake of Pi in 35S:MIM156 Arabidopsis plants were increased compared with wild-type (Col-0 ecotype) plants. 35S:rSPL3 seedlings showed similar anthocyanin accumulation and Pi content phenotypes to those of 35S:MIM156 plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that the SPL3 protein directly bound to GTAC motifs in the PLDZ2, Pht1;5 and miR399f promoters. The expression of several Pi starvation-induced genes was increased in 35S:MIM156 and 35S:rSPL3 plants, including high-affinity Pi transporters, Mt4/TPS1-like genes and phosphatases. Collectively, our results suggest that the miR156-SPL3-Pht1;5 (-PLDZ2 and -miR399f) pathways constitute a component of the Pi deficiency-induced regulatory mechanism of Arabidopsis.
