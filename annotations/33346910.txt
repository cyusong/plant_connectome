Allopolyploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) carries three pairs of homoeologous genomes but its meiotic pairing is diploid-like. This is the effect of the Ph (pairing homoeologous) system which restricts chromosome pairing to strictly homologous. Ph1 is the locus with the strongest effect. Disabling Ph1 permits pairing between homoeologues and is routinely used in chromosome engineering to introgress alien variation into breeding stocks. Whereas the efficiency of Ph1 and the general pattern of homoeologous crossovers in its absence are quite well known from numerous studies, other characteristics of such crossovers remain unknown. This study analyzed the crossover points in four sets of the ph1b-induced recombinants between wheat homologues as well as between three wheat and rye (Secale cereale) homoeologous chromosome arms, and compared them to crossovers between homologues in a reference wheat population. The results show the Ph1 locus also controls crossing over of homologues, and the general patterns of homologous (with Ph1) and homoeologous (with ph1b) crossing over are the same. In all intervals analyzed, homoeologous crossovers fell within the range of frequency distribution of homologous crossovers among individual families of the reference population. No specific DNA sequence characteristics were identified that could be recognized by the Ph1 locus; the only difference between homologous and homoeologous crossing over appears to be in frequency. It is concluded that the Ph1 locus likely recognizes DNA sequence similarity; crossing over is permitted between very similar sequences. In the absence of Ph1 dissimilarities are ignored, in proportion to the level of the sequence divergence.
