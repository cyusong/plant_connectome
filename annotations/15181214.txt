['15181214', 'An Arabidopsis expressed sequence tag clone, 221D24, encoding a lipase has been  characterized using an antisense approach. The lipase gene is expressed during  normal growth and development of Arabidopsis rosette leaves but is down-regulated  as the leaves senesce. When plants are exposed to sublethal levels of UV-B  radiation, expression of the lipase is strongly up-regulated. The lipase protein  is localized in the cell cytosol and is present in all organs of Arabidopsis  plants. Recombinant lipase protein produced in Escherichia coli preferentially  hydrolyzed phospholipids, indicating that the gene encodes a phospholipase.  Transgenic plants in which lipase expression is suppressed showed enhanced  tolerance to UV-B stress but not osmotic stress and were unable to up-regulate  PR-1 expression when irradiated with UV-B. The observations collectively indicate  that the lipase is capable of deesterifying membrane phospholipids and is  up-regulated in response to UV-B irradiation.', '2004 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.036376', 'Thompson']
