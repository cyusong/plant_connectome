Adaptation of plants to phosphate (Pi) deficiency is a complex process involving host of biochemical changes. These changes are integrated at transcriptional level by Pi starvation mediated signal transduction pathway. Many of the signaling processes are regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation directed by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. In this study, we report the characterization of a protein phosphatase gene (LePS2;1) from tomato induced during phosphate starvation. The bacterially expressed recombinant LePS2;1 protein readily dephosphorylated a synthetic phospho-Ser/Thr peptide. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, suppressed the enzyme activity. Western blot analysis revealed the Pi starvation dependent accumulation of LePS2;1 protein. Over-expression of LePS2;1 in tomato plants resulted in increased anthocyanin accumulation and acid phosphatase activity under Pi sufficient condition. Transgenic plants exhibited distinct changes in morphology and delayed flower initiation. These results provide evidence that the protein phosphatase LePS2;1, plays an important role in phosphate starvation induced processes in tomato. To our knowledge this is the first comprehensive analysis of a protein phosphatase induced during phosphate starvation.
