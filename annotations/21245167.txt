['21245167', 'Cytosine DNA methylation is evolutionarily ancient, and in eukaryotes this  epigenetic modification is associated with gene silencing. Proteins with SRA  (SET- or RING-associated) methyl-binding domains are required for the  establishment and/or maintenance of DNA methylation in both plants and mammals.  The 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC)-binding specificity of several SRA domains have been  characterized, and each one has a preference for DNA methylation in different  sequence contexts. Here we demonstrate through mobility shift assays and  calorimetric measurements that the SU(VAR)3-9 HOMOLOG 5 (SUVH5) SRA domain  differs from other SRA domains in that it can bind methylated DNA in all contexts  to similar extents. Crystal structures of the SUVH5 SRA domain bound to  5mC-containing DNA in either the fully or hemimethylated CG context or the  methylated CHH context revealed a dual flip-out mechanism where both the 5mC and  a base (5mC, C, or G, respectively) from the partner strand are simultaneously  extruded from the DNA duplex and positioned within binding pockets of individual  SRA domains. Our structure-based in vivo studies suggest that a functional SUVH5  SRA domain is required for both DNA methylation and accumulation of the H3K9  dimethyl modification in vivo, suggesting a role for the SRA domain in  recruitment of SUVH5 to genomic loci.', '2011 Jan 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1980311', 'Jacobsen']
