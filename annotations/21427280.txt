Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) is a highly infectious potexvirus and a major disease of greenhouse tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) crops worldwide. Damage and economic losses caused by PepMV vary greatly and can be attributed to differential symptomatology caused by different PepMV isolates. Here, we used a custom-designed Affymetrix tomato GeneChip array with probe sets to interrogate over 22,000 tomato transcripts to study transcriptional changes in response to inoculation of tomato seedlings with a mild and an aggressive PepMV isolate that share 99.4% nucleotide sequence identity. The two isolates induced a different transcriptomic response, despite accumulating to similar viral titers. PepMV inoculation resulted in repression of photosynthesis. In addition, defense responses were stronger upon inoculation with the aggressive isolate, in both cases mediated by salicylic acid signaling rather than by jasmonate signaling. Our results furthermore show that PepMV differentially regulates the RNA silencing pathway, suggesting a role for a PepMV-encoded silencing suppressor. Finally, perturbation of pigment biosynthesis, as shown by differential regulation of the flavonoid and lycopene biosynthesis pathways, was monitored. Metabolite analyses on mature fruits of PepMV-infected tomato plants, which showed typical fruit marbling, revealed a decrease in carotenoids, likely responsible for the marbled phenotype, and an increase in alkaloids and phenylpropanoids that are associated with pathogen defense in the yellow sectors of the fruit.
