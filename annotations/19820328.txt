The rhizosphere is strongly influenced by plant-derived phytochemicals exuded by roots and plant species exert a major selective force for bacteria colonizing the root-soil interface. We have previously shown that rhizobacterial recruitment is tightly regulated by plant genetics, by showing that natural variants of Arabidopsis thaliana support genotype-specific rhizobacterial communities while also releasing a unique blend of exudates at six weeks post-germination. To further understand how exudate release is controlled by plants, changes in rhizobacterial assemblages of two Arabidopsis accessions, Cvi and Ler where monitored throughout the plants' life cycle. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints revealed that bacterial communities respond to plant derived factors immediately upon germination in an accession-specific manner. Rhizobacterial succession progresses differently in the two accessions in a reproducible manner. However, as plants age, rhizobacterial and control bulk soil communities converge, indicative of an attenuated rhizosphere effect, which coincides with the expected slow down in the active release of root exudates as plants reach the end of their life cycle. These data strongly suggest that exudation changes during plant development are highly genotype-specific, possibly reflecting the unique, local co-evolutionary communication processes that developed between Arabidopsis accessions and their indigenous microbiota.
