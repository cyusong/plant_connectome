['15024005', 'The subcellular distribution of Met and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) metabolism  in plant cells discloses a complex partition between the cytosol and the  organelles. In the present work we show that Arabidopsis contains three  functional isoforms of vitamin B(12)-independent methionine synthase (MS), the  enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of homocysteine to Met with  5-methyltetrahydrofolate as methyl group donor. One MS isoform is present in  chloroplasts and is most likely required to methylate homocysteine that is  synthesized de novo in this compartment. Thus, chloroplasts are autonomous and  are the unique site for de novo Met synthesis in plant cells. The additional MS  isoforms are present in the cytosol and are most probably involved in the  regeneration of Met from homocysteine produced in the course of the activated  methyl cycle. Although Met synthesis can occur in chloroplasts, there is no  evidence that AdoMet is synthesized anywhere but the cytosol. In accordance with  this proposal, we show that AdoMet is transported into chloroplasts by a  carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion process. This carrier is able to catalyze  the uniport uptake of AdoMet into chloroplasts as well as the exchange between  cytosolic AdoMet and chloroplastic AdoMet or S-adenosylhomocysteine. The obvious  function for the carrier is to sustain methylation reactions and other  AdoMet-dependent functions in chloroplasts and probably to remove  S-adenosylhomocysteine generated in the stroma by methyltransferase activities.  Therefore, the chloroplastic AdoMet carrier serves as a link between cytosolic  and chloroplastic one-carbon metabolism.', '2004 May 21', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M313250200', 'Douce']
