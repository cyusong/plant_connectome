Tobacco is a cash crop throughout the world, and its growth and development are affected by abiotic stresses including drought stress; therefore, drought-tolerant breeding may help to improve tobacco yield and quality under drought stress conditions. Considering that the plant hormone ABA (abscisic acid) is able to regulate plant responses to abiotic stresses via activating ABA response genes, the characterization of ABA response genes may enable the identification of genes that can be used for molecular breeding to improve drought tolerance in tobacco. We report here the identification of NtAITRs (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> ABA-induced transcription repressors) as a family of novel regulators of drought tolerance in tobacco. Bioinformatics analysis shows that there are a total of eight <i>NtAITR</i> genes in tobacco, and all the NtAITRs have a partially conserved LxLxL motif at their C-terminus. RT-PCR results show that the expression levels of at least some <i>NtAITRs</i> were increased in response to ABA and drought treatments, and NtAITRs, when recruited to the <i>Gal4</i> promoter via a fused GD (<i>Gal4</i> DNA-binding domain), were able to repress transcription activator LD-VP activated expression of the <i>LexA-Gal4-GUS</i> reporter gene. Roles of NtAITRs in regulating drought tolerance in tobacco were analyzed by generating CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited mutants. A total of three Cas9-free <i>ntaitr12356</i> quintuple mutants were obtained, and drought treatment assays show that drought tolerance was increased in the <i>ntaitr12356</i> quintuple mutants. On the other hand, results of seed germination and seedling greening assays show that ABA sensitivity was increased in the <i>ntaitr12356</i> quintuple mutants, and the expression levels of some ABA signaling key regulator genes were altered in the <i>ntaitr12356-c3</i> mutant. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>NtAITRs</i> are ABA-responsive genes, and that NtAITRs function as transcription repressors and negatively regulate drought tolerance in tobacco, possibly by affecting plant ABA response via affecting the expression of ABA signaling key regulator genes.
