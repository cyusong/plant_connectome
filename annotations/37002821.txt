Drought is a common stress in agricultural production. Thus, it is imperative to understand how fruit crops respond to drought and to develop drought-tolerant varieties. This paper provides an overview of the effects of drought on the vegetative and reproductive growth of fruits. We summarize the empirical studies that have assessed the physiological and molecular mechanisms of the drought response in fruit crops. This review focuses on the roles of calcium (Ca2+) signaling, abscisic acid (ABA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, and protein phosphorylation underlying the early drought response in plants. We review the resulting downstream ABA-dependent and ABA-independent transcriptional regulation in fruit crops under drought stress. Moreover, we highlight the positive and negative regulatory mechanisms of microRNAs in the drought response of fruit crops. Lastly, strategies (including breeding and agricultural practices) to improve the drought resistance of fruit crops are outlined.

Ca2+: !signals! ABA
ABA: !regulates! Transcriptional Regulation
ROS: !signals! Protein Phosphorylation
microRNAs: !regulate! Drought Response
Breeding: !improves! Drought Resistance
