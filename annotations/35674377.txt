Biogenesis of ribonucleoproteins occurs in dynamic subnuclear compartments called Cajal bodies (CBs). COILIN is a critical scaffolding component essential for CB formation, composition, and activity. We recently showed that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtCOILIN is phosphorylated in response to bacterial elicitor treatment. Here, we further investigated the role of AtCOILIN in plant innate immunity. Atcoilin mutants are compromised in defense responses to bacterial pathogens. Besides confirming a role of AtCOILIN in alternative splicing (AS), Atcoilin showed differential expression of genes that are distinct from those of AS, including factors involved in RNA biogenesis, metabolism, plant immunity, and phytohormones. Atcoilin mutant plants have reduced levels of defense phytohormones. As expected, the mutant plants were more sensitive to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Our findings reveal an important role for AtCOILIN in innate plant immunity.
