Recently we reported that CRLK1, a novel calcium/calmodulin-regulated receptor-like kinase plays an important role in regulating plant cold tolerance. Calcium/calmodulin binds to CRLK1 and upregulates its activity. Gene knockout and complementation studies revealed that CRLK1 is a positive regulator of plant response to chilling and freezing temperatures. Here we show that MEKK1, a member of MAP kinase kinase kinase family, interacts with CRLK1 both in vitro and in planta. The cold triggered MAP kinase activation in wild-type plants was abolished in crlk1 knockout mutants. Similarly, the cold induced expression levels of genes involved in MAP kinase signaling are also altered in crlk1 mutants. These results suggest that calcium/calmodulin-regulated CRLK1 modulates cold acclimation through MAP kinase cascade in plants.
