Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub> S) promotes plant tolerance against various environmental cues, and d-cysteine desulfhydrase (DCD) is an enzymatic source of H<sub>2</sub> S to enhance abiotic stress resistance. However, the role of DCD-mediated H<sub>2</sub> S production in root growth under abiotic stress remains to be further elucidated. Here, we report that DCD-mediated H<sub>2</sub> S production alleviates osmotic stress-mediated root growth inhibition by promoting auxin homeostasis. Osmotic stress up-regulated DCD gene transcript and DCD protein levels and thus H<sub>2</sub> S production in roots. When subjected to osmotic stress, a dcd mutant showed more severe root growth inhibition, whereas the transgenic lines DCDox overexpressing DCD exhibited less sensitivity to osmotic stress in terms of longer root compared to the wild-type. Moreover, osmotic stress inhibited root growth through repressing auxin signaling, whereas H<sub>2</sub> S treatment significantly alleviated osmotic stress-mediated inhibition of auxin. Under osmotic stress, auxin accumulation was increased in DCDox but decreased in dcd mutant. H<sub>2</sub> S promoted auxin biosynthesis gene expression and auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) protein level under osmotic stress. Taken together, our results reveal that mannitol-induced DCD and H<sub>2</sub> S in roots promote auxin homeostasis, contributing to alleviating the inhibition of root growth under osmotic stress.
