['12789341', 'In animals, the sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) functions  as both an intracellular messenger and an extracellular ligand for  G-protein-coupled receptors of the S1P receptor family, regulating diverse  biological processes ranging from cell proliferation to apoptosis. Recently, it  was discovered in plants that S1P is a signalling molecule involved in abscisic  acid (ABA) regulation of guard cell turgor. Here we report that the enzyme  responsible for S1P production, sphingosine kinase (SphK), is activated by ABA in  Arabidopsis thaliana, and is involved in both ABA inhibition of stomatal opening  and promotion of stomatal closure. Consistent with this observation, inhibition  of SphK attenuates ABA regulation of guard cell inward K(+) channels and slow  anion channels, which are involved in the regulation of stomatal pore size.  Surprisingly, S1P regulates stomatal apertures and guard cell ion channel  activities in wild-type plants, but not in knockout lines of the sole  prototypical heterotrimeric G-protein alpha-subunit gene, GPA1 (refs 5, 6, 7-8).  Our results implicate heterotrimeric G proteins as downstream elements in the S1P  signalling pathway that mediates ABA regulation of stomatal function, and suggest  that the interplay between S1P and heterotrimeric G proteins represents an  evolutionarily conserved signalling mechanism.', '2003 Jun 5', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature01643', 'Assmann']
