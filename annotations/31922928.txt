Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is an important respiratory enzyme which participates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. A previous study of the baseline sensitivity of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> against SDH inhibitors (SDHIs) showed that intrinsic sensitivity of the small population against the SDHIs exhibited significant differences. In the sequencing assay, we found five kinds of amino acid polymorphism in SDH subunit C (SdhC) of <i>B. cinerea</i> isolates which were never exposed to the SDHIs. To validate that amino acid polymorphism in the SdhC of <i>B. cinerea</i> confers intrinsic sensitivity against the SDHIs, the replacement mutants containing each kind of amino acid polymorphism of SdhC exhibited phenotype differences in intrinsic sensitivity to SDHIs, mycelial growth, sporulation, virulence, oxidative stress response, and carbon source utilization. These results indicated that SdhC of <i>B. cinerea</i> experienced positive selection during evolution and resulted in amino acid polymorphism which is involved in intrinsic sensitivity to SDHIs and biological fitness.
