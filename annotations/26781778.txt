The stilbene synthase gene VqSTS6, from Chinese wild type Vitis quinquangularis accession Danfeng-2, increases the resveratrol content and pathogen resistance of transgenic plants of V. vinifera Thompson Seedless. This study successfully created transgenic plants of V. vinifera Thompson Seedless which overexpressed VqSTS6, cloned from Chinese wild type V. quinquangularis accession Danfeng-2. Western blot and qRT-PCR showed a variable range in transcript levels among transgenic lines. The resistance to powdery mildew (Uncinula necator) was particularly enhanced in lines most highly expressing VqSTS6. Compared with the non-transformed controls, trans-resveratrol and other stilbene compounds were significantly increased in the transgenic lines. The correlation between high resveratrol content and high pathogen resistance in transgenic grapes is discussed. We hypothesize that the fruit-specific, highly expressed gene VqSTS6 from Chinese wild V. quinquangularis accession Danfeng-2, is directly involved in the resveratrol synthesis pathway in grapes, and plays an important role in the plant's defense against pathogens. Genetic transformation of VqSTS6 explored the potential of the wild Chinese grape species for use in breeding, the results of which would raise both the disease resistance and the fruit quality of V. vinifera grapevines.
