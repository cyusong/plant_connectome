Climate change such as changing temperature and increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO(2), are likely to drive significant modifications in forests. While many studies have demonstrated the responses and adoptions of tree to fluctuations in climatic and environmental conditions, the impact of environmental signals on trees is complex and poorly understood with respect to the molecular biology in context of the seasonal change of environmental signals. This addendum is focused on the impact of environmental signals on growth-dormancy cycle of trees growing in temperate regions, especially the regulation of cell cycle regulators by temperature and photoperiod. In addition, the plant hormone control of growth-dormancy cycle of trees and cell cycle regulators in the cambium is also discussed.
