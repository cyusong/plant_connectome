['20668058', 'Green light added to blue light has been proposed to shift cryptochromes from  their semireduced active form to the reduced, inactive state. Whether the  increased proportion of green light observed under leaf canopies compared to open  places reduces cryptochrome-mediated effects remained to be elucidated. Here we  report that the length of the hypocotyl of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  seedlings grown under controlled conditions decreased linearly with increasing  blue/green ratios of the light within the range of ratios found in natural  environments. This effect was stronger under higher irradiances. We developed a  model, parameterized on the basis of field experiments including photoreceptor  mutants, where hypocotyl growth of seedlings exposed to different natural  radiation environments was related to the action and interaction of phytochromes  and cryptochromes. Adding the blue/green ratio of the light in the term involving  cryptochrome activity improved the goodness of fit of the model, thus supporting  a role of the blue/green ratio under natural radiation. The blue/green ratio  decreased sharply with increasing shade by green grass leaves to one-half of the  values observed in open places. The impact of blue/green ratio on  cryptochrome-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl growth was at least as large as  that of irradiance. We conclude that cryptochrome is a sensor of blue irradiance  and blue/green ratio.', '2010 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.160820', 'Casal']
