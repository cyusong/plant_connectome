The taxonomic terms "<i>Phlomis</i>" and "<i>Phlomoides</i>" had been used to describe two sections within the genus <i>Phlomis</i> belonging to the Lamiaceae family. Recently, phylogenetic analyses using molecular markers showed that <i>Phlomis</i> and <i>Phlomoides</i> formed two monophyletic clades, and thus they are generally accepted as separate genera. In this study, we assembled the complete chloroplast genome of <i>Phlomis fruticosa</i>, which is the first reported chloroplast genome belonging to <i>Phlomis</i> genus, as well as the complete chloroplast genome of <i>Phlomoides strigosa</i> belonging to <i>Phlomoides</i> genus. The results showed that the length of chloroplast genome was 151,639 bp (<i>Phlomis fruticosa</i>) and 152,432 bp (<i>Phlomoides strigosa</i>), with conserved large single copy regions, small single copy regions, and inverted repeat regions. 121 genes in <i>Phlomis fruticosa</i> and 120 genes in <i>Phlomoides strigosa</i> were annotated. The chloroplast genomes of <i>Phlomis fruticosa</i>, <i>Phlomoides strigosa</i>, and three reported <i>Phlomoides</i> species, as well as those of 51 species from the Lamiaceae family, which covered 12 subfamilies, were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. The <i>Phlomis</i> and <i>Phlomoides</i> species were split into two groups, which were well supported by both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference tree analyses. Our study provided further evidence to recognize <i>Phlomis</i> and <i>Phlomoides</i> as independent genera.
