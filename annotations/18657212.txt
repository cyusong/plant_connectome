Striga is a parasitic weed attacking mainly maize, sorghum, millet and cowpea. Studying the interaction between rice and Striga is valuable since rice is a model monocot. In this paper, the susceptibility of different rice cultivars to S. hermonthica was tested and quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Striga tolerance mapped on the Bala x Azucena F(6) population. Seven rice cultivars were grown with and without S. hermonthica for 14 wk. For the mapping experiment, 115 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), along with Azucena and Bala, were grown with and without Striga for 11 wk. Rice cultivars tested had different susceptibilities to Striga, ranging from highly susceptible to completely resistant. Azucena and Bala differed in the speed of Striga emergence and the impact on host growth. A genomic region between positions 139 and 166 cM on chromosome 1 was identified containing strong QTL (LOD = 4.9-15.7) for all traits measured. This indicates that genes for Striga tolerance exist in rice germplasm and the mapped QTL can be further studied to promote understanding of the nature of resistance/tolerance and breeding for Striga-resistant crop plants.
