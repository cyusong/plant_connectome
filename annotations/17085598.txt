Direct repeats of Arabidopsis telomeric sequence were constructed to test telomere-mediated chromosomal truncation in maize. Two constructs with 2.6 kb of telomeric sequence were used to transform maize immature embryos by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. One hundred seventy-six transgenic lines were recovered in which 231 transgene loci were revealed by a FISH analysis. To analyze chromosomal truncations that result in transgenes located near chromosomal termini, Southern hybridization analyses were performed. A pattern of smear in truncated lines was seen as compared with discrete bands for internal integrations, because telomeres in different cells are elongated differently by telomerase. When multiple restriction enzymes were used to map the transgene positions, the size of the smears shifted in accordance with the locations of restriction sites on the construct. This result demonstrated that the transgene was present at the end of the chromosome immediately before the integrated telomere sequence. Direct evidence for chromosomal truncation came from the results of FISH karyotyping, which revealed broken chromosomes with transgene signals at the ends. These results demonstrate that telomere-mediated chromosomal truncation operates in plant species. This technology will be useful for chromosomal engineering in maize as well as other plant species.
