Plant viral infections alter gene expression and metabolism in infected host. To study the molecular responses of Mexican lime to CTV infection, an analysis of plant metabolome in response to infection with severe (T318) or mild (T385) isolates of CTV was performed. Healthy plants and those infected with any of the two virus strains showed different metabolite profiles, at different stages of new sprout development. Proline content increased in plants infected with CTV, proportionally to the virulence of the virus strain. Abscisic acid content decreased after virus infection whereas jasmonic and salicylic acid levels increased. CTV infection had an impact on plant secondary metabolism, by stimulating the synthesis of different metabolites such as l-methylhistidine, phenylpropanoid derivatives. These metabolites are common responses of different organisms, including higher mammals, to viral diseases, and its presence in this system points to the existence of universal responses to virus infection among different kingdoms.
