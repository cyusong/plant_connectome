['30113309', "Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana Formin 2 (AtFH2) localizes to  plasmodesmata (PD) through its transmembrane domain and is required for normal  intercellular trafficking. Although loss-of-function atfh2 mutants have no overt  developmental defect, PD's permeability and sensitivity to virus infection are  increased in atfh2 plants. Interestingly, AtFH2 functions in a partially  redundant manner with its closest homolog AtFH1, which also contains a PD  localization signal. Strikingly, targeting of Class I formins to PD was also  confirmed in rice, suggesting that the involvement of Class I formins in  regulating actin dynamics at PD may be evolutionarily conserved in plants. In  vitro biochemical analysis showed that AtFH2 fails to nucleate actin assembly but  caps and stabilizes actin filaments. We also demonstrate that the interaction  between AtFH2 and actin filaments is crucial for its function in vivo. These data  allow us to propose that AtFH2 regulates PD's permeability by anchoring actin  filaments to PD.", '2018 Aug 16', 'Elife', '10.7554/eLife.36316', 'ORCID:']
