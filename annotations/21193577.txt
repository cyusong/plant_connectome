White rust, caused by Albugo candida, is a serious pathogen of Brassica juncea (Indian mustard) and poses a potential hazard to the presently developing canola-quality B. juncea industry worldwide. A comparative proteomic study was undertaken to explore the molecular mechanisms that underlie the defence responses of Brassica juncea to white rust disease caused by the biotrophic oomycete Albugo candida. Nineteen proteins showed reproducible differences in abundance between a susceptible (RH 819) and a resistant variety (CBJ 001) of B. juncea following inoculation with A. candida. The identities of all 19 proteins were successfully established through Q-TOF MS/MS. Five of these proteins were only detected in the resistant variety and showed significant differences in their abundance at various times following pathogen inoculation in comparison to mock-inoculated plants. Among these was a thaumatin-like protein (PR-5), a protein not previously associated with the resistance of B. juncea towards A. candida. One protein, peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) isoform CYP20-3, was only detected in the susceptible variety and increased in abundance in response to the pathogen. PPIases have recently been discovered to play an important role in pathogenesis by suppressing the host cell's immune response. For a subset of seven proteins examined in more detail, an increase in transcript abundance always preceded their induction at the proteome level. These findings are discussed within the context of the A. candida-Brassica juncea pathosystem, especially in relation to host resistance to this pathogen.

Thaumatin-like protein: !increases in abundance! in resistant variety 
Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase isoform CYP20-3: !increases in abundance! in susceptible variety 
PPIases: !suppresses! host cell's immune response 
Transcripts: !precede! induction at proteome level
