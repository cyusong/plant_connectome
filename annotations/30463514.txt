Photoperiod-sensitivity is a critical endogenous regulatory mechanism for plant growth and development under specific environmental conditions, while phosphate and sucrose signaling processes play key roles in cell growth and organ initiation. MicroRNA399 is phosphate-responsive, but, whether it has roles in other metabolic processes remains unknown. MicroRNA399 was determined to be sucrose-responsive through a microRNA array assay. High levels of sucrose inhibited the accumulation of microRNA399 family under phosphate starvation conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana. Similarly, exogenous sucrose supplementation also reduced microRNA399 expression in maize at developmental transition stages. RNA sequencing of a near-isogenic line(photoperiod-sensitive) line and its recurrent parent Huangzao4, a photoperiod-insensitive line, was conducted at various developmental stages. Members of microRNA399 family were down-regulated under long-day conditions in the photoperiod-sensitive near-isogenic line that accumulated more sucrose in vivo compared with the control line Huangzao4. MicroRNA399s may play central roles in the integration of sucrose sensing and photoperiodic responses under long day conditions in maize.
