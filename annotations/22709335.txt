The direct analysis of phytosiderophores (PSs) and their metal complexes in plants is critical to understanding the biological functions of different PSs. Here we report on a rapid and highly sensitive liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS) method for the direct and simultaneous determination of free PSs and their ferric complexes in plants. In addition to previously reported PSs--deoxymugineic acid (DMA), mugineic acid (MA) and epihydroxymugineic acid (epi-HMA)--two more PSs, avenic acid (AVA) and hydroxyavenic acid (HAVA), were identified by this method in roots of Hordeum vulgare cv Himalaya and in root exudates under iron (Fe) deficiency. The two identified PSs could be responsible for Fe acquisition under Fe deficiency because of their relative abundance and ability to form ferric complexes in secreted root exudates. This LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS method greatly facilitates the identification of free PSs and PS-Fe complexes in one plant sample.
