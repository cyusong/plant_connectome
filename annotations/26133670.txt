['26133670', 'Members of the highly conserved class of BEACH domain containing proteins (BDCPs)  have been established as broad facilitators of protein-protein interactions and  membrane dynamics in the context of human diseases like albinism, bleeding  diathesis, impaired cellular immunity, cancer predisposition, and neurological  dysfunctions. Also, the Arabidopsis thaliana BDCP SPIRRIG (SPI) is important for  membrane integrity, as spi mutants exhibit split vacuoles. In this work, we  report a novel molecular function of the BDCP SPI in ribonucleoprotein particle  formation. We show that SPI interacts with the P-body core component DECAPPING  PROTEIN 1 (DCP1), associates to mRNA processing bodies (P-bodies), and regulates  their assembly upon salt stress. The finding that spi mutants exhibit salt  hypersensitivity suggests that the local function of SPI at P-bodies is of  biological relevance. Transcriptome-wide analysis revealed qualitative  differences in the salt stress-regulated transcriptional response of Col-0 and  spi. We show that SPI regulates the salt stress-dependent post-transcriptional  stabilization, cytoplasmic agglomeration, and localization to P-bodies of a  subset of salt stress-regulated mRNAs. Finally, we show that the PH-BEACH domains  of SPI and its human homolog FAN (Factor Associated with Neutral sphingomyelinase  activation) interact with DCP1 isoforms from plants, mammals, and yeast,  suggesting the evolutionary conservation of an association of BDCPs and P-bodies.', '2015 Jul', 'PLoS Biol', '10.1371/journal.pbio.1002188', 'Hulskamp']
