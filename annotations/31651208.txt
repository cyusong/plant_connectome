Electrical signaling, similar to chemical signalings such as calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), reactive oxygen species (ROS, mainly hydrogen peroxide: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), regulates many physiological processes. However, the effect of electrical stimulation on seed germination, seedling growth, and thermotolerance improvement in maize was little known. In this study, using maize as materials, the effect of electrical stimulation on seed germination, seedling growth, and thermotolerance improvement in maize was explored. The results suggested that electrical stimulation with optimal intensity boosted germination rate and seedling growth (as indicated in the increase in the length of shoots and roots, as well as fresh weight) under normal germination conditions. In addition, electrical stimulation augmented the survival rate of maize seedlings, mitigated the decrease in the tissue vitality, and reduced the peroxidation of membrane lipids under heat stress. These data suggested that electrical stimulation could boost seed germination, seedling growth, and thermotolerance improvement in maize.
