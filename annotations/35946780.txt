Climate change is challenging the resilience of grapevine (Vitis), one of the most important crops worldwide. Adapting viticulture to a hotter and drier future will require a multifaceted approach including the breeding of more drought-tolerant genotypes. In this study, we focused on plant hydraulics as a multi-trait system that allows the plant to maintain hydraulic integrity and gas exchange rates longer under drought. We quantified a broad range of drought-related traits within and across Vitis species, created in silico libraries of trait combinations, and then identified drought tolerant trait syndromes. By modeling the maintenance of hydraulic integrity of current cultivars and the drought tolerant trait syndromes, we identified elite ideotypes that increased the amount of time they could experience drought without leaf hydraulic failure. Generally, elites exhibited a trait syndrome with lower stomatal conductance, earlier stomatal closure, and a larger hydraulic safety margin. We demonstrated that, when compared with current cultivars, elite ideotypes have the potential to decrease the risk of hydraulic failure across wine regions under future climate scenarios. This study reveals the syndrome of traits that can be leveraged to protect grapevine from experiencing hydraulic failure under drought and increase drought tolerance.
