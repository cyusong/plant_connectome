Arabidopsis seeds release large capsules of mucilaginous polysaccharides, which are shaped by an intricate network of cellulosic microfibrils. Cellulose synthase complexes are guided by the microtubule cytoskeleton, but it is unclear which proteins mediate this process in the seed coat epidermis. Using reverse genetics, we identified IQ67 DOMAIN 9 (IQD9) and KINESIN LIGHT CHAIN-RELATED 1 (KLCR1) as two highly expressed genes during seed development and comprehensively characterized their roles in cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis. Mutations in IQD9 as well as in KLCR1 lead to compact mucilage capsules with aberrant cellulose distribution, which can be rescued by transgene complementation. IQD9 physically interacts with KLCR1 and localizes to cortical microtubules (MTs) to maintain their organization in seed coat epidermal (SCE) cells. IQD9 as well as a previously identified TONNEAU1 (TON1) RECRUITING MOTIF 4 (TRM4) protein act to maintain cellulose synthase velocity. Our results demonstrate that IQD9, KLCR1 and TRM4 are MT-associated proteins that are required for seed mucilage architecture. This study provides the first direct evidence that members of the IQD, KLCR and TRM families have overlapping roles in cell wall biosynthesis. Therefore, SCE cells provide an attractive system to further decipher the complex genetic regulation of polarized cellulose deposition.
