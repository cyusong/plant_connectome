Drought stress is a serious threat to rice productivity. Investigating genetic variations between drought-tolerant (DT) and drought-sensitive (DS) rice cultivars may decipher the candidate genes/regulatory regions involved in drought stress tolerance/response. In this study, whole-genome resequencing data of four DS and five DT rice cultivars were analyzed. We identified a total of ~4.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 0.54 million insertions/deletions (InDels) in our study. The genetic variations (162,638 SNPs and 17,217 InDels) differentiating DS and DT rice cultivars were found to be unevenly distributed throughout the rice genome; however, they were more frequent near the transcription start and stop sites than in the genic regions. The cis-regulatory motifs representing the binding sites of stress-related transcription factors (MYB, HB, bZIP, ERF, ARR and AREB) harbouring the SNPs/InDels in the promoter regions of a few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Importantly, many of these DEGs were located within the drought-associated quantitative trait loci. Overall, this study provides a valuable large-scale genotyping resource and facilitates the discovery of candidate genes associated with drought stress tolerance in rice.
