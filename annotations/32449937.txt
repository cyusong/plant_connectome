['32449937', 'SERRATE/ARS2 is a conserved RNA effector protein involved in transcription,  processing and export of different types of RNAs. In Arabidopsis, the  best-studied function of SERRATE (SE) is to promote miRNA processing. Here, we  report that SE interacts with the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex,  comprising the RNA helicase HEN2, the RNA binding protein RBM7 and one of the two  zinc-knuckle proteins ZCCHC8A/ZCCHC8B. The identification of common targets of SE  and HEN2 by RNA-seq supports the idea that SE cooperates with NEXT for RNA  surveillance by the nuclear exosome. Among the RNA targets accumulating in  absence of SE or NEXT are miRNA precursors. Loss of NEXT components results in  the accumulation of pri-miRNAs without affecting levels of miRNAs, indicating  that NEXT is, unlike SE, not required for miRNA processing. As compared to se-2,  se-2 hen2-2 double mutants showed increased accumulation of pri-miRNAs, but  partially restored levels of mature miRNAs and attenuated developmental defects.  We propose that the slow degradation of pri-miRNAs caused by loss of HEN2  compensates for the poor miRNA processing efficiency in se-2 mutants, and that SE  regulates miRNA biogenesis through its double contribution in promoting miRNA  processing but also pri-miRNA degradation through the recruitment of the NEXT  complex.', '2020 Jul 9', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkaa373', 'Jarmolowski']
