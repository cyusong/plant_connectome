['17114348', 'Secondary walls in fibers and tracheary elements constitute the most abundant  biomass produced by plants. Although a number of genes involved in the  biosynthesis of secondary wall components have been characterized, little is  known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated expression of  these genes. Here, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis thaliana NAC (for NAM,  ATAF1/2, and CUC2) domain transcription factor, SND1 (for secondary  wall-associated NAC domain protein), is a key transcriptional switch regulating  secondary wall synthesis in fibers. We show that SND1 is expressed specifically  in interfascicular fibers and xylary fibers in stems and that dominant repression  of SND1 causes a drastic reduction in the secondary wall thickening of fibers.  Ectopic overexpression of SND1 results in activation of the expression of  secondary wall biosynthetic genes, leading to massive deposition of secondary  walls in cells that are normally nonsclerenchymatous. In addition, we have found  that SND1 upregulates the expression of several transcription factors that are  highly expressed in fibers during secondary wall synthesis. Together, our results  reveal that SND1 is a key transcriptional activator involved in secondary wall  biosynthesis in fibers.', '2006 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.047399', 'Ye']
