High light and high temperature (HLHT) stress induces the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in many plants. Recently, we described a HLHT-sensitive rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) mutant, <i>local lesions</i> (<i>ls1</i>), that exhibits local lesions under HLHT, due to DNA damage and excess ROS accumulation. Here, we determined that an HLHT treatment induced the local lesion phenotype in <i>ls1</i> within 6 h. Corroborating this result, we found that transient HLHT treatment influenced the expression of many genes in the <i>ls1</i> mutant, while affecting the growth and development of young leaves.

HLHT: !induces! ROS production
HLHT: !induces! local lesion phenotype
HLHT: !influences! gene expression
HLHT: !affects! growth and development
