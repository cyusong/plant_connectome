['20488895', 'Arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental poison that inhibits root elongation and  seed germination to a variable extent depending on the plant species. To  understand the molecular mechanisms of arsenic resistance, a genetic screen was  developed to isolate arsenate overly sensitive (aos) mutants from an  activation-tagged Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) population. Three aos  mutants were isolated, and the phenotype of each was demonstrated to be due to an  identical disruption of plastidial LIPOAMIDE DEHYDROGENASE1 (ptLPD1), a gene that  encodes one of the two E3 isoforms found in the plastidial pyruvate dehydrogenase  complex. In the presence of arsenate, ptlpd1-1 plants exhibited reduced root and  shoot growth and enhanced anthocyanin accumulation compared with wild-type  plants. The ptlpd1-1 plants accumulated the same amount of arsenic as wild-type  plants, indicating that the aos phenotype was not due to increased arsenate in  the tissues but to an increase in the innate sensitivity to the poison.  Interestingly, a ptlpd1-4 knockdown allele produced a partial aos phenotype. Two  loss-of-function alleles of ptLPD2 in Arabidopsis also caused elevated arsenate  sensitivity, but the sensitivity was less pronounced than for the ptlpd1 mutants.  Moreover, both the ptlpd1 and ptlpd2 mutants were more sensitive to arsenite than  wild-type plants, and the LPD activity in isolated chloroplasts from wild-type  plants was sensitive to arsenite but not arsenate. These findings show that the  ptLPD isoforms are critical in vivo determinants of arsenite-mediated arsenic  sensitivity in Arabidopsis and possible strategic targets for increasing arsenic  tolerance.', '2010 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.153452', 'Finnegan']
