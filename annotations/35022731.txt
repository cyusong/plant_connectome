Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) displays wide plasticity to climate; however, the physiology of dormancy along a seasonal continuum is poorly understood. Here we investigated the apparent disconnect between dormancy and the underlying respiratory physiology and transcriptome of grapevine buds, from bud set in summer to bud burst in spring. The establishment of dormancy in summer was pronounced and reproducible; however, this was coupled with little or no change in physiology, indicated by respiration, hydration, and tissue oxygen tension. The release of dormancy was biphasic; the depth of dormancy declined substantially by mid-autumn, while the subsequent decline towards spring was moderate. Observed changes in physiology failed to explain the first phase of dormancy decline, in particular. Transcriptome data contrasting development from summer through to spring also indicated that dormancy was poorly reflected by metabolic quiescence during summer and autumn. Gene Ontology and enrichment data revealed the prevailing influence of abscisic acid (ABA)-related gene expression during the transition from summer to autumn, and promoter motif analysis suggested that photoperiod may play an important role in regulating ABA functions during the establishment of dormancy. Transcriptomic data from later transitions reinforced the importance of oxidation and hypoxia as physiological cues to regulate the maintenance of quiescence and resumption of growth. Collectively these data reveal a novel disconnect between growth and metabolic quiescence in grapevine following bud set, which requires further experimentation to explain the phenology and dormancy relationships.
