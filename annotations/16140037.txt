['16140037', 'Phospholipase A2s (PLA2s) are enzymes that liberate lysophospholipids and free  fatty acids (FFAs) from membrane phospholipids in response to hormones and other  external stimuli. This report describes the cloning and functional  characterization of a PLA2 cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtsPLA2-alpha, which  represents one of four secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) genes in Arabidopsis. The encoded  protein is 148-amino acid polypeptide and is predicted to contain a 20-amino acid  signal peptide at its amino terminus. The predicted mature form (Mr=14,169) of  AtsPLA2-alpha exhibited approximately 5 times the specific activity of its  pre-processed form. Different from animal sPLA2s, AtsPLA2-alpha showed a  significant preference for the acyl group linoleic acid over palmitic acid in  phospholipid hydrolysis. Like some animal sPLA2s, however, it has a slight  preference for phosphatidylethanolamine over phosphatidylcholine as the  substrate. The specific activity of AtsPLA2-alpha continuously increased as the  Ca2+ concentration was increased to 10 mM, and the optimal pH range was very  broad and biphasic between 6 and 11. AtsPLA2-alpha transcript was detected at low  levels in roots, stems, leaves, and flowers but not in siliques.', '2005 Sep 15', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbalip.2005.08.005', 'Palta']
