['19483696', 'Consumption of cruciferous vegetables is associated with reduced risk of  developing cancer, a phenomenon attributed to glucosinolates, which are  characteristic of these vegetables. We report production of the bioactive  benzylglucosinolate in the noncruciferous plant Nicotiana benthamiana through  metabolic engineering. The study includes identification of gamma-glutamyl  peptidase 1 (GGP1), which substantially increased glucosinolate production by  metabolizing an accumulating glutathione conjugate, an activity not previously  described for glucosinolate biosynthesis or for proteins containing glutamine  amidotransferase domains.', '2009 Aug', 'Nat Chem Biol', '10.1038/nchembio.185', 'Halkier']
