The expression of 28 high light (HL)-responsive genes of Arabidopsis was analysed in response to environmental and physiological factors known to influence the expression of the HL-responsive gene, ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE2 (APX2). Most (81%) of the HL-responsive genes, including APX2, required photosynthetic electron transport for their expression, and were responsive to abscisic acid (ABA; 68%), strengthening the impression that these two signals are crucial in the expression of HL-responsive genes. Further, from the use of mutants altered in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, it was shown that 61% of these genes, including APX2, may be responsive to chloroplast-sourced ROS. In contrast, apoplastic/plasma membrane-sourced H2O2, in part directed by the respiratory burst NADPH oxidases AtrbohD and AtrbohF, was shown to be important only for APX2 expression. APX2 expression in leaves is limited to bundle sheath parenchyma; however, for the other genes in this study, information on their tissue specificity of expression is sparse. An analysis of expression in petioles, enriched for bundle sheath tissue compared with distal leaf blade, in HL and control leaves showed that 25% of them had >10-fold higher expression in the petiole than in the leaf blade. However, this did not mean that these petiole expression genes followed a pattern of regulation observed for APX2.
