More than a dozen secreted peptides are now recognized as important hormones that coordinate and specify cellular functions in plants. Recent evidence has shown that secreted peptide hormones often undergo post-translational modification and proteolytic processing, which are critical for their function. Such 'small post-translationally modified peptide hormones' constitute one of the largest groups of peptide hormones in plants. This short review highlights recent progress in research on post-translationally modified peptide hormones, with particular emphasis on their structural characteristics and modification mechanisms.
