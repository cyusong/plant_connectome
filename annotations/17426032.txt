['17426032', 'Squalene epoxidase converts squalene into oxidosqualene, the precursor of all  known angiosperm cyclic triterpenoids, which include membrane sterols,  brassinosteroid phytohormones, and non-steroidal triterpenoids. In this work, we  have identified six putative Arabidopsis squalene epoxidase (SQE) enzymes and  used heterologous expression in yeast to demonstrate that three of these enzymes,  SQE1, SQE2, and SQE3, can epoxidize squalene. We isolated and characterized  Arabidopsis sqe1 mutants and discovered severe developmental defects, including  reduced root and hypocotyl elongation. Adult sqe1-3 and sqe1-4 plants have  diminished stature and produce inviable seeds. The sqe1-3 mutant accumulates  squalene, consistent with a block in the triterpenoid biosynthetic pathway.  Therefore, SQE1 function is necessary for normal plant development, and the five  SQE-like genes remaining in this mutant are not fully redundant with SQE1.', '2007 Jun 8', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M611831200', 'Bartel']
