The intimate linkage between H3K36me3 and m<sup>6</sup> A modifications has been demonstrated in mammals. In this issue, Shim et al. (2020) show that similar crosstalk between histone modification and mRNA methylation is conserved in plants, but H3K36me2 is more important for m6A deposition in plants.
