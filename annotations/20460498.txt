The functional roles of miR402 in Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated under abiotic stress conditions. Overexpression of miR402 accelerated the seed germination and seedling growth of Arabidopsis under salt stress conditions, while its overexpression promoted only seed germination but not seedling growth of Arabidopsis under dehydration or cold stress conditions. The expression of DEMETER-LIKE protein3 mRNA was down-regulated in miR402-overexpressing transgenic plants. These results imply that miR402 plays a role as a positive regulator of seed germination and seedling growth of Arabidopsis under stress conditions, and that microRNA-guided regulation of DNA demethylation is an adaptive process of plants to stress conditions.
