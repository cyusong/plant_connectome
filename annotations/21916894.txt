['21916894', '* A protein encoded by At1g32080 was consistently identified in proteomic studies  of Arabidopsis chloroplast envelope membranes, but its function remained unclear.  The protein, designated AtLrgB, may have evolved from a gene fusion of lrgA and  lrgB. In bacteria, two homologous operons, lrgAB and cidAB, participate in an  emerging mechanism to control cell death and lysis. * We aim to characterize  AtLrgB using reverse genetics and cell biological and biochemical analysis. *  AtLrgB is expressed in leaves, but not in roots. T-DNA insertion mutation of  AtLrgB produced plants with interveinal chlorotic and premature necrotic leaves.  Overexpression of full-length AtLrgB (or its LrgA and LrgB domains, separately),  under the control of CaMV 35S promoter, produced plants exhibiting veinal  chlorosis and delayed greening. At the end of light period, the T-DNA mutant had  high starch and low sucrose contents in leaves, while the 35S:AtLrgB plants had  low starch and high sucrose contents. Metabolite profiling revealed that AtLrgB  appeared not to directly transport triose phosphate or hexose phosphates. In  yeast cells, AtLrgB could augment nystatin-induced membrane permeability. * Our  work indicates that AtLrgB is a new player in chloroplast development, carbon  partitioning and leaf senescence, although its molecular mechanism remains to be  established.', '2012 Jan', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03867.x', 'Wang']
