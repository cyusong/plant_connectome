Arabidopsis histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylases play crucial roles in several developmental processes, but their involvement in seedling establishment remain unexplored. Here, we show that Arabidopsis JUMONJI DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN17 (JMJ17), an H3K4me3 demethylase, is involved in cotyledon greening during seedling establishment. Dark-grown seedlings of jmj17 accumulated a high concentration of protochlorophyllide, an intermediate metabolite in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis (TPB) pathway that generates chlorophyll (Chl) during photomorphogenesis. Upon light irradiation, jmj17 mutants displayed decreased cotyledon greening and reduced Chl level compared with the wild-type; overexpression of JMJ17 completely rescued the jmj17-5 phenotype. Transcriptomics analysis uncovered that several genes encoding key enzymes involved in TPB were upregulated in etiolated jmj17 seedlings. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR revealed elevated H3K4me3 level at the promoters of target genes. Chromatin association of JMJ17 was diminished upon light exposure. Furthermore, JMJ17 interacted with PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. JMJ17 binds directly to gene promoters to demethylate H3K4me3 to suppress PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE OXIDOREDUCTASE C expression and TPB in the dark. Light results in de-repression of gene expression to modulate seedling greening during de-etiolation. Our study reveals a new role for histone demethylase JMJ17 in controlling cotyledon greening in etiolated seedlings during the dark-to-light transition.
