Despite their importance, there remains a paucity of large-scale gene expression-based studies of reproductive development in species belonging to the Triticeae. As a first step to address this deficiency, a gene expression atlas of triticale reproductive development was generated using the 55K Affymetrix GeneChip(®) wheat genome array. The global transcriptional profiles of the anther/pollen, ovary and stigma were analyzed at concurrent developmental stages, and co-expressed as well as preferentially expressed genes were identified. Data analysis revealed both novel and conserved regulatory factors underlying Triticeae floral development and function. This comprehensive resource rests upon detailed gene annotations, and the expression profiles are readily accessible via a web browser.
