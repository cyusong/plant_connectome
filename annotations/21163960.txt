The SLEEPY1 (SLY1) F-box gene is a positive regulator of gibberellin (GA) signaling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Loss of SLY1 results in GA-insensitive phenotypes including dwarfism, reduced fertility, delayed flowering, and increased seed dormancy. These sly1 phenotypes are partially rescued by overexpression of the SLY1 homolog SNEEZY (SNE)/SLY2, suggesting that SNE can functionally replace SLY1. GA responses are repressed by DELLA family proteins. GA relieves DELLA repression when the SCF(SLY1) (for Skp1, Cullin, F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates DELLA protein, thereby targeting it for proteolysis. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using constitutively expressed 35S:hemagglutinin (HA)-SLY1 and 35S:HA-SNE translational fusions in the sly1-10 background suggest that SNE can function similarly to SLY1 in GA signaling. Like HA-SLY1, HA-SNE interacted with the CULLIN1 subunit of the SCF complex, and this interaction required the F-box domain. Like HA-SLY1, HA-SNE coimmunoprecipitated with the DELLA REPRESSOR OF GA1-3 (RGA), and this interaction required the SLY1 or SNE carboxyl-terminal domain. Whereas HA-SLY1 overexpression resulted in a decrease in both DELLA RGA and RGA-LIKE2 (RGL2) protein levels, HA-SNE caused a decrease in DELLA RGA but not in RGL2 levels. This suggests that one reason HA-SLY1 is able to effect a stronger rescue of sly1-10 phenotypes than HA-SNE is because SLY1 regulates a broader spectrum of DELLA proteins. The FLAG-SLY1 fusion protein was found to coimmunoprecipitate with the GA receptor HA-GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF1b (GID1b), supporting the model that SLY1 regulates DELLA through interaction with the DELLA-GA-GID1 complex.
