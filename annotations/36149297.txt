Transcription activation is tightly associated with the openness of chromatin and allows direct contact between transcriptional regulators and their targeted DNA for gene expression. However, there are limited studies on the annotation of open chromatin regions (OCRs) in rice (Oryza sativa), especially those in reproductive organs. Here, we characterized OCRs in rice pistils and anthers with an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing. Despite a large overlap, we found more OCRs in pistils than in anthers. These OCRs were enriched in gene transcription start sites (TSSs) and showed tight associations with gene expression. Transcription factor (TF) binding motifs were enriched at these OCRs as validated by TF chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. Pistil-specific OCRs provided potential regulatory networks by binding directly to the targets, indicating that pistil-specific OCRs may be indicators of cis-regulatory elements in regulating pistil development, which are absent in anthers. We also found that open chromatin of pistils and anthers responded differently to low temperature (LT). These data offer a comprehensive overview of OCRs regulating reproductive organ development and LT responses in rice.
