Strigolactones (SLs) can be classified into two structurally distinct groups: canonical and non-canonical SLs. Canonical SLs contain the ABCD ring system, and non-canonical SLs lack the A, B, or C ring but have the enol ether-D ring moiety, which is essential for biological activities. The simplest non-canonical SL is the SL biosynthetic intermediate carlactone. In plants, carlactone and its oxidized metabolites, such as carlactonoic acid and methyl carlactonoate, are present in root and shoot tissues. In some plant species, including black oat (Avena strigosa), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), and maize (Zea mays), non-canonical SLs in the root exudates are major germination stimulants. Various plant species, such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), Arabidopsis, and poplar (Populus spp.), release carlactonoic acid into the rhizosphere. These observations suggest that both canonical and non-canonical SLs act as host-recognition signals in the rhizosphere. In contrast, the limited distribution of canonical SLs in the plant kingdom, and the structure-specific and stereospecific transportation of canonical SLs from roots to shoots, suggest that plant hormones inhibiting shoot branching are not canonical SLs but, rather, are non-canonical SLs.
