The onset of leaf de-greening and senescence is governed by a complex regulatory network including environmental cues and internal factors such as transcription factors (TFs) and phytohormones, in which ethylene (ET) is one key inducer. However, the detailed mechanism of ET signalling for senescence regulation is still largely unknown. Here, we found that the WRKY TF SbWRKY50 from Sorghum bicolor L., a direct target of the key component ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 in ET signalling, functioned for leaf senescence repression. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein9-edited SbWRKY50 mutant (SbWRKY5O-KO) of sorghum displayed precocious senescent phenotypes, while SbWRKY50 overexpression delayed age-dependent and dark-induced senescence in sorghum. SbWRKY50 negatively regulated chlorophyll degradation through direct binding to the promoters of several chlorophyll catabolic genes. In addition, SbWRKY50 recruited the Polycomb repressive complex 1 through direct interaction with SbBMI1A, to induce histone 2A mono-ubiquitination accumulation on the chlorophyll catabolic genes for epigenetic silencing and thus delayed leaf senescence. Especially, SbWRKY50 can suppress early steps of chlorophyll catabolic pathway via directly repressing SbNYC1 (NON-YELLOW COLORING 1). Other senescence-related hormones could also influence leaf senescence through repression of SbWRKY50. Hence, our work shows that SbWRKY50 is an essential regulator downstream of ET and SbWRKY50 also responds to other phytohormones for senescence regulation in sorghum.
