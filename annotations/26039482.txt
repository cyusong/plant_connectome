"Phosphoinositide" refers to phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol, including phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. Both of these molecules could be in vivo substrates of plant phospholipase C. These phosphoinositides can also be biologically active "per se," by directly binding to proteins and thus altering their location and/or activity. The use of pharmacological agents in Arabidopsis suspension cells allowed us to identify genes whose expression was positively or negatively controlled, in the basal state, by products of phosphoinositide-dependent phospholipase C. In this basal state, it seems that no genes exhibit a phosphoinositide-dependent expression "per se." However, many genes whose expression is altered in the presence of phospholipase C inhibitors appeared to be responsive to salicylic acid. This allowed us to show that salicylic acid acts both by increasing the phosphoinositide pool and by inhibiting the phospholipase C. In response to salicylic acid it is possible to identify genes whose expression is controlled by products of PI-PLC, but also genes whose expression is controlled by phosphoinositides "per se." Our data highlight the importance of phosphoinositide-dependent pathways in gene expression in resting cells and in response to phytohormones.
