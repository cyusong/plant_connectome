['29618637', "2',3'-cAMP is an intriguing small molecule that is conserved among different  kingdoms. 2',3'-cAMP is presumably produced during RNA degradation, with  increased cellular levels observed especially under stress conditions.  Previously, we observed the presence of 2',3'-cAMP in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) protein complexes isolated from native lysate, suggesting that  2',3'-cAMP has potential protein partners in plants. Here, affinity purification  experiments revealed that 2',3'-cAMP associates with the stress granule (SG)  proteome. SGs are aggregates composed of protein and mRNA, which enable cells to  selectively store mRNA for use in response to stress such as heat whereby  translation initiation is impaired. Using size-exclusion chromatography and  affinity purification analyses, we identified Rbp47b, the key component of SGs,  as a potential interacting partner of 2',3'-cAMP. Furthermore, SG formation was  promoted in 2',3'-cAMP-treated Arabidopsis seedlings, and interactions between  2',3'-cAMP and RNA-binding domains of Rbp47b, RRM2 and RRM3, were confirmed in  vitro using microscale thermophoresis. Taken together, these results (1) describe  novel small-molecule regulation of SG formation, (2) provide evidence for the  biological role of 2',3'-cAMP, and (3) demonstrate an original biochemical  pipeline for the identification of protein-metabolite interactors.", '2018 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.18.00285', 'ORCID:']
