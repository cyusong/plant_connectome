Sesame is a rare example of non-model and minor crop for which numerous genetic loci and candidate genes underlying features of interest have been disclosed at relatively high resolution. These progresses have been achieved thanks to the applications of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach. GWAS has benefited from the availability of high-quality genomes, re-sequencing data from thousands of genotypes, extensive transcriptome sequencing, development of haplotype map and web-based functional databases in sesame. In this paper, we reviewed the GWAS methods, the underlying statistical models and the applications for genetic discovery of important traits in sesame. A novel online database SiGeDiD ( http://sigedid.ucad.sn/ ) has been developed to provide access to all genetic and genomic discoveries through GWAS in sesame. We also tested for the first time, applications of various new GWAS multi-locus models in sesame. Collectively, this work portrays steps and provides guidelines for efficient GWAS implementation in sesame, a non-model crop.
