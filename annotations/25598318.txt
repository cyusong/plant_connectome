Species are normally considered to be the fundamental unit for understanding the evolution of biodiversity. Yet, in a survey of botanists in 1940, twice as many felt that plant genera were more natural units than plant species. Revisiting the survey, we found more people now regarded species as a more evolutionarily real unit, but a sizeable number still felt that genera were more evolutionarily real than species. Definitions of 'evolutionarily real' split into those based on shared evolutionary history and those based on shared evolutionary fate via ongoing evolutionary processes. We discuss recent work testing for shared evolutionary fate at the species and higher levels and present preliminary evidence for evolutionarily significant higher taxa in plants.

Species: !considered! Fundamental unit for understanding evolution of biodiversity
Genera: !considered! More natural units than species
Evolutionarily real: !split into! Shared evolutionary history & shared evolutionary fate
Shared evolutionary fate: !tested at! Species & higher levels 
Higher taxa: !preliminary evidence for! Evolutionarily significant
