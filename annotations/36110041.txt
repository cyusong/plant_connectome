Plant cuticular wax accumulation limits nonstomatal transpiration and is regulated by external environmental stresses. DEWAX (DECREASE WAX BIOSYNTHESIS) plays a vital role in diurnal wax biosynthesis. However, how DEWAX expression is controlled and the molecular mechanism of wax biosynthesis regulated by the diurnal cycle remains largely unknown. Here, we identified two Arabidopsis MYB-SHAQKYF transcription factors, MYS1 and MYS2, as new regulators in wax biosynthesis and drought tolerance. Mutations of both MYS1 and MYS2 caused significantly reduced leaf wax, whereas overexpression of MYS1 or MYS2 increased leaf wax biosynthesis and enhanced drought tolerance. Our results demonstrated that MYS1 and MYS2 act as transcription repressors and directly suppress DEWAX expression via ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression motifs. Genetic interaction analysis with DEWAX, SPL9 (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 9), and CER1 (ECERIFERUM 1) in wax biosynthesis and under drought stresses demonstrated that MYS1 and MYS2 act upstream of the DEWAX-SPL9 module, thus regulating CER1 expression. Expression analysis suggested that the diurnal expression pattern of DEWAX is partly regulated by MYS1 and MYS2. Our findings demonstrate the roles of two unidentified transcription repressors, MYS1 and MYS2, in wax biosynthesis and provide insights into the mechanism of diurnal cycle-regulated wax biosynthesis.
