<i>Zoysia matrella</i> is a salt-tolerant turfgrass grown in areas with high soil salinity irrigated with effluent water. Previous studies focused on explaining the regulatory mechanism of <i>Z. matrella</i> salt-tolerance at phenotypic and physiological levels. However, the molecular mechanism associated with salt tolerance of <i>Z. matrella</i> remained unclear. In this study, a high-efficient method named FOX (full-length cDNA overexpression) hunting system was used to search for salt-tolerant genes in <i>Z. matrella</i>. Eleven candidate genes, including several known or novel salt-tolerant genes involved in different metabolism pathways, were identified. These genes exhibited inducible expression under salt stress condition. Furthermore, a novel salt-inducible candidate gene <i>ZmGnTL</i> was transformed into <i>Arabidopsis</i> for functional analysis. <i>ZmGnTL</i> improved salt-tolerance through regulating ion homeostasis, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and osmotic adjustment. In summary, we demonstrated that FOX is a reliable system for discovering novel genes relevant to salt tolerance and several candidate genes were identified from <i>Z. matrella</i> that can assist molecular breeding for plant salt-tolerance improvement.
