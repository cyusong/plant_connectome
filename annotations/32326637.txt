Calmodulin (CaM) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor that regulates a wide variety of target proteins, many of which interact through short basic helical motifs bearing two hydrophobic 'anchor' residues. CaM comprises two globular lobes, each containing a pair of EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding motifs that form a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced hydrophobic pocket that binds an anchor residue. A central flexible linker allows CaM to accommodate diverse targets. Several reported CaM interactors lack these anchors but contain Lys/Arg-rich polybasic sequences adjacent to a lipidated N- or C-terminus. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM binds the myristoylated N-terminus of CAP23/NAP22 with intimate interactions between the lipid and a surface comprised of the hydrophobic pockets of both lobes, while the basic residues make electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged surface of CaM. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM binds farnesylcysteine, derived from the farnesylated polybasic C-terminus of KRAS4b, with the lipid inserted into the C-terminal lobe hydrophobic pocket. CaM sequestration of the KRAS4b farnesyl moiety disrupts KRAS4b membrane association and downstream signaling. Phosphorylation of basic regions of N-/C-terminal lipidated CaM targets can reduce affinity for both CaM and the membrane. Since both N-terminal myristoylated and C-terminal prenylated proteins use a Singly Lipidated Polybasic Terminus (SLIPT) for CaM binding, we propose these polybasic lipopeptide elements comprise a non-canonical CaM-binding motif.
