<i>Ustilaginoidea virens</i> is a biotrophic fungal pathogen specifically colonizing rice floral organ and causes false smut disease of rice. This disease has emerged as a serious problem that hinders the application of high-yield rice cultivars, by reducing grain yield and quality as well as introducing mycotoxins. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of <i>U. virens</i> are still enigmatic. Here we demonstrate that <i>U. virens</i> employs a secreted protein UvCBP1 to manipulate plant immunity. <i>In planta</i> expression of <i>UvCBP1</i> led to compromised chitin-induced defense responses in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice, including burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), callose deposition, and expression of defense-related genes. <i>In vitro</i>-purified UvCBP1 protein competes with rice chitin receptor OsCEBiP to bind to free chitin, thus impairing chitin-triggered rice immunity. Moreover, <i>UvCBP1</i> could significantly promote infection of <i>U. virens</i> in rice flowers. Our results uncover a mechanism of a floral fungus suppressing plant immunity and pinpoint a universal role of chitin-battlefield during plant-fungi interactions.
