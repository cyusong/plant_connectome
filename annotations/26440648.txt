Regulation of flowering time is crucial for reproductive success of plants. FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein is a central component of florigen and forms a ternary complex with 14-3-3 and FD, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, in the shoot apex and promotes flowering. This complex formation requires phosphorylation of threonine residue at position 282 of FD. A calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK33 is responsible for the phosphorylation. However, possibly due to functional redundancy among calcium-dependent protein kinases, impact of the loss of CPK33 reported in the previous study was rather limited. Here, we report that expression of a kinase-dead form of CPK33 caused a clear delayed-flowering phenotype, supporting for an important role of CPK33 in florigen function through FD phosphorylation.
