The photosynthetic machinery and, in particular, the photosystem II (PSII) complex are susceptible to strong light, and the effects of strong light are referred to as photodamage or photoinhibition. In living organisms, photodamaged PSII is rapidly repaired and, as a result, the extent of photoinhibition represents a balance between rates of photodamage and the repair of PSII. In this study, we examined the roles of electron transport and ATP synthesis in these two processes by monitoring them separately and systematically in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We found that the rate of photodamage, which was proportional to light intensity, was unaffected by inhibition of the electron transport in PSII, by acceleration of electron transport in PSI, and by inhibition of ATP synthesis. By contrast, the rate of repair was reduced upon inhibition of the synthesis of ATP either via PSI or PSII. Northern blotting and radiolabeling analysis with [(35)S]Met revealed that synthesis of the D1 protein was enhanced by the synthesis of ATP. Our observations suggest that ATP synthesis might regulate the repair of PSII, in particular, at the level of translation of the psbA genes for the precursor to the D1 protein, whereas neither electron transport nor the synthesis of ATP affects the extent of photodamage.
