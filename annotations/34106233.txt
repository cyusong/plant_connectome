Pod shattering, which causes the explosive release of seeds from the pod, is one of the main sources of yield losses in cowpea in arid and semi-arid areas. Reduction of shattering has therefore been a primary target for selection during domestication and improvement of cowpea, among other species. Using a mini-core diversity panel of 368 cowpea accessions, four regions with a statistically significant association with pod shattering were identified. Two genes (Vigun03g321100 and Vigun11g100600), involved in cell wall biosynthesis, were identified as strong candidates for pod shattering. Microscopic analysis was conducted on a subset of accessions representing the full spectrum of shattering phenotypes. This analysis indicated that the extent of wall fiber deposition was highly correlated with shattering. The results from this study also demonstrate that pod shattering in cowpea is exacerbated by arid environmental conditions. Finally, using a subset of West African landraces, patterns of historical selection for shattering resistance related to precipitation in the environment of origin were identified. Together, these results shed light on sources of resistance to pod shattering, which will, in turn, improve climate resilience of a major global nutritional staple.
