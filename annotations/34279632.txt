Betalain is one of four major plant pigments and shares some features with anthocyanin; however, no plant has been found to biosynthesize both pigments. Previous studies have reported that anthocyanin biosynthesis in some plants is regulated by post-transcriptional gene-silencing (PTGS), but the importance of PTGS in betalain biosynthesis remains unclear. In this study, we report the occurrence of PTGS in betalain biosynthesis in bougainvillea (Bougainvillea peruviana) 'Thimma', which produces bracts of three different color on the same plant, namely pink, white, and pink-white. This resembles the unstable anthocyanin pigmentation phenotype that is associated with PTGS, and hence we anticipated the presence of PTGS in the betalain biosynthetic pathway. To test this, we analysed pigments, gene expression, small RNAs, and transient overexpression. Our results demonstrated that PTGS of BpCYP76AD1, a gene encoding one of the betalain biosynthesis enzymes, is responsible for the loss of betalain biosynthesis in 'Thimma'. Neither the genetic background nor DNA methylation in the BpCYP76AD1 sequence could explain the induction of PTGS, implying that another locus controls the unstable pigmentation. Our results indicate that naturally occurring PTGS contributes to the diversification of color patterns not only in anthocyanin biosynthesis but also in betalain biosynthesis.
