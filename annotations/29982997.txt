Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses can improve plant tolerance to multiple stresses. We compared three AM fungi (AMF) from different genera, one of them isolated from a dry and saline environment, in terms of their ability to increase tomato tolerance to moderate or severe drought or salt stress. Plant physiological parameters and metabolic profiles were compared in order to find the molecular mechanisms underlying plant protection against stress. Mycorrhizal growth response was determined, and ultrahigh-performance LC-MS was used to compare the metabolic profile of plants under the different treatments. All AMF increased plant tolerance to stress, and the positive effects of the symbiosis were correlated with the severity of the stress. The AMF isolated from the stressful environment was the most effective in improving plant tolerance to salt stress. Differentially accumulated compounds were identified and the antistress properties of some of them were confirmed. We demonstrate that AM symbioses increase plant metabolic plasticity to cope with stress. Some responses were common to all AMF tested, while others were specifically related to particular isolates. Important metabolism reprograming was evidenced upon salt stress, and we identified metabolic pathways and compounds differentially accumulated in mycorrhizas that may underlie their enhanced tolerance to stress.
