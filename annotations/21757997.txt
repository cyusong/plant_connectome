Seed germination is an elaborate developmental process that is regulated through intricate signaling networks integrating diverse environmental cues into endogenous hormonal signaling pathways. Accumulating evidence in recent years supports the role of auxin in seed germination. Whereas the roles of gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) in the germination process have been studied extensively, how auxin modulates seed germination is largely unknown. We found that a membrane-bound NAC transcription factor NTM2 mediates the signaling crosstalk between auxin and salt stress via the IAA30 gene during seed germination in Arabidopsis. Germination of the NTM2-deficient ntm2-1 mutant seeds exhibited enhanced resistance to high salinity. However, the salt resistance was reduced in the ntm2-1 mutant overexpressing the IAA30 gene, which was induced by high salinity in a NTM2-dependent manner. Exogenous auxin treatment further suppressed the reduced germination rate of control seeds under high salinity. In contrast, the auxin effects disappeared in the ntm2-1 mutant. These observations indicate that NTM2 is a molecular link that incorporates auxin signal into salt stress signaling during seed germination, providing a role of auxin in modulating seed germination under high salinity.
