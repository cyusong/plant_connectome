Soil salinity significantly represses plant development and growth. Mechanisms involved sodium (Na+) extrusion and compartmentation, intracellular membrane trafficking as well as redox homeostasis regulation play important roles in plant salt tolerance. In this study, we report that Patellin1 (PATL1), a membrane trafficking-related protein, modulates salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. The T-DNA insertion mutant of PATL1 (patl1) with an elevated PATL1 transcription level displays a salt-sensitive phenotype. PATL1 partially associates with the plasma membrane (PM) and endosomal system, and might participate in regulating membrane trafficking. Interestingly, PATL1 interacts with SOS1, a PM Na+/H+ antiporter in the Salt-Overly-Sensitive (SOS) pathway, and the PM Na+/H+ antiport activity is lower in patl1 than in Col-0. Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content is higher in patl1 and the redox signaling of antioxidants is partially disrupted in patl1 under salt stress conditions. Artificial elimination of ROS could partially rescue the salt-sensitive phenotype of patl1. Taken together, our results indicate that PATL1 participates in plant salt tolerance by regulating Na+ transport at least in part via SOS1, and by modulating cellular redox homeostasis during salt stress.
