['9215910', 'We have identified a new locus involved in gibberellin (GA) signal transduction  by screening for suppressors of the Arabidopsis thaliana GA biosynthetic mutant  gal-3. The locus is named RGA for repressor of gal-3. Based on the recessive  phenotype of the digenic rga/gal-3 mutant, the wild-type gene product of RGA is  probably a negative regulator of GA responses. Our screen for suppressors of  gal-3 identified 17 mutant alleles of RGA as well as 10 new mutant alleles at the  previously identified SPY locus. The digenic (double homozygous) rga/gal-3  mutants are able to partially repress several defects of gal-3 including stem  growth, leaf abaxial trichome initiation, flowering time, and apical dominance.  The phenotype of the trigenic mutant (triple homozygous) rga/spy/gal-3 shows that  rga and spy have additive effects regulating flowering time, abaxial leaf  trichome initiation and apical dominance. This trigenic mutant is similar to wild  type with respect to each of these developmental events. Because rga/spy/gal-3 is  almost insensitive to GA for hypocotyl growth and its bolting stem is taller than  the wild-type plant, the combined effects of the rga and spy mutations appear to  allow GA-independent stem growth. Our studies indicate that RGA lies on a  separate branch of the GA signal transduction pathway from SPY, which leads us to  propose a modified model of the GA response pathway.', '1997 Jul', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/146.3.1087', 'Sun']
