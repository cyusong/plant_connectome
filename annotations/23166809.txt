['23166809', 'F-Box (FBX) proteins are encoded by a multigene family present in major lineages  of eukaryotes. A number of FBX proteins are shown to be subunits of SCF complex,  a type of E3 ligases composed of SKP1, CULLIN, FBX and RBX1 proteins. The  Arabidopsis SKP-LIKE (ASK) proteins are also members of a family and some of them  interact with FBX proteins directly. To clarify how FBX and ASK proteins combine,  we carried out a large-scale interaction analysis between FBX and ASK proteins  using yeast two-hybrid assay (Y2H) in Arabidopsis thaliana. FBX proteins randomly  chosen from those proteins that interacted with more than one ASK protein were  further analyzed for their subcellular localization and in vivo interaction with  ASK proteins. Furthermore, the expression profiles of FBX and ASK genes were  compared. This work reveals that FBX proteins had a preference for interacting  with ASK proteins depending on the domains they contain such as the  FBX-associated (FBA) domain, the Kelch domain and leucine rich repeat (LRR). In  addition, it was found that a single FBX protein could form multiple SCF  complexes by interacting with several ASK proteins in many cases. Furthermore, it  was suggested that the variation of SCF complexes were especially abundant in  tissues related to male gametophyte and seed development. More than half of the  FBX proteins studied did not interact with any of the ASK proteins, implying the  necessity for certain regulations for their interaction in vivo and/or distinct  roles from subunits of the SCF complex.', '2012', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0050009', 'Matsui']
