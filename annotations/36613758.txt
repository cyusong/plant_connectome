Plant biomass is the most abundant renewable resource in nature. In a circular economy perspective, the implementation of its bioconversion into fermentable sugars is of great relevance. Lytic Polysaccharide MonoOxygenases (LPMOs) are accessory enzymes able to break recalcitrant polysaccharides, boosting biomass conversion and subsequently reducing costs. Among them, auxiliary activity of family 9 (AA9) acts on cellulose in synergism with traditional cellulolytic enzymes. Here, we report for the first time, the production of the AA9 LPMOs from the mesophilic <i>Trichoderma reesei</i> (TrAA9B) and the thermophilic <i>Thermoascus aurantiacus</i> (TaAA9B) microorganisms in tobacco by plastid transformation with the aim to test this technology as cheap and sustainable manufacture platform. In order to optimize recombinant protein accumulation, two different N-terminal regulatory sequences were used: 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) from <i>T7g10</i> gene (DC41 and DC51 plants), and 5' translation control region (5'-TCR), containing the 5'-UTR and the first 14 amino acids (Downstream Box, DB) of the plastid <i>atpB</i> gene (DC40 and DC50 plants). Protein yields ranged between 0.5 and 5% of total soluble proteins (TSP). The phenotype was unaltered in all transplastomic plants, except for the DC50 line accumulating AA9 LPMO at the highest level, that showed retarded growth and a mild pale green phenotype. Oxidase activity was spectrophotometrically assayed and resulted higher for the recombinant proteins without the N-terminal fusion (DC41 and DC51), with a 3.9- and 3.4-fold increase compared to the fused proteins.
