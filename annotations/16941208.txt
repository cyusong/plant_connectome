Telomeres, the nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, are maintained at a species-specific equilibrium length. Arabidopsis thaliana is a self-fertilizing plant and different geographical isolates or ecotypes show differing telomere-lengths. We have exploited this telomere-length polymorphism between Arabidopsis ecotypes to investigate the genetic regulation of telomere length by analysing telomere lengths in 16 different inter-ecotype crosses between plants with differing telomere sizes. With two exceptions, the inter-ecotype hybrid plants present a new telomere-length set point, intermediate between that of the two parents. A regulation mechanism thus shortens the longer and lengthens the shorter telomeres.

Telomeres: !maintain! equilibrium length
Arabidopsis thaliana: !exhibits! telomere-length polymorphism
Inter-ecotype crosses: !show! intermediate telomere-length set point
Regulation mechanism: !shortens! longer telomeres, !lengthens! shorter telomeres
