Exploring the mechanism of Gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) treatment on seed germination of moso bamboo can lay a foundation for its future breeding and research. In this study, the germination-related indicators (germination rate, germination potential, vigor index, respiration rate) with different content of GA<sub>3</sub> treatment were measured, and the ultrastructure of moso bamboo seeds treated with low and high GA<sub>3</sub> concentrations was observed during the germination process. In addition, the transcriptome data of the germination seeds, with and without GA<sub>3</sub> treatment were analyzed. The results showed that the low GA<sub>3</sub> concentration (10 mol/L) increased the germination rate, germination potential, vigor index and respiration rate, thus promoting the germination of moso bamboo seeds, but a high concentration of GA<sub>3</sub> (50 mol/L) inhibited the seed germination. The low GA<sub>3</sub> concentration accelerated the decomposition of starch and fat and promoted the vacuole formation of cells, but the high GA<sub>3</sub> concentration damaged organelles and increased the endocytosis of cells. Compared with untreated moso bamboo seeds, the seeds had fewer genes expressed after GA<sub>3</sub> treatment. Starch and carbon metabolism play a very important role in seed development and embryo viability, whether the seed is treated with GA<sub>3</sub> or not. After hormone treatment, GID1 and DELLA-related genes homologous to rice genes is not expressed, but the expression of PIF4, PIF5, GA<sub>3</sub><i>ox</i>2, GA<sub>2</sub><i>oxs</i>, etc., were up-regulated.
