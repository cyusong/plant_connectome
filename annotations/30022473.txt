Chloride channel (CLC) proteins are important anion transporters conserved in organisms ranging from bacteria and yeast to plants and animals. According to sequence comparison, some plant CLCs are predicted to function as Cl<sup>-</sup> /H<sup>+</sup> antiporters, but not Cl<sup>-</sup> channels. However, no direct evidence was provided to verify the role of these plant CLCs in regulating the pH of the intracellular compartment. We identified tobacco CLC-Nt1 interacting with the Potato virus Y (PVY) 6K2 protein. To investigate its physiological function, homologous genes of CLC-Nt1 in Nicotiana benthamiana were knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Complementation experiments were subsequently performed by expression of wild-type or point-mutated CLC-Nt1 in knockout mutants. The data presented herein demonstrate that CLC-Nt1 is localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein (pHluorin), we found that loss of CLC-Nt1 function resulted in a decreased ER luminal pH. Secreted GFP (secGFP) was retained mostly in ER in knockout mutants, indicating that CLC-Nt1 is also involved in protein secretion. PVY infection induced a rise in ER luminal pH, which was dependent on functional CLC-Nt1. By contrast, loss of CLC-Nt1 function inhibited PVY intracellular replication and systemic infection. We propose that PVY alters ER luminal pH for infection in a CLC-Nt1-dependent manner.
