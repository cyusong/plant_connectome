Saline-alkaline soil affects crop growth and development, thereby suppressing the yields. Human activities and climate changes are putting arable land under the threat of saline-alkalization. To feed a growing global population in limited arable land, it is of great urgence to breed saline-alkaline tolerant crops to cope with food security. Plant salt-tolerance mechanisms have already been explored for decades. However, to date, the molecular mechanisms underlying plants responses to saline-alkaline stress have remained largely elusive. Here, we summarize recent advances in plant response to saline-alkaline stress and propose some points deserving of further exploration.
