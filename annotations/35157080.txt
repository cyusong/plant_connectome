Most land plants benefit from endosymbiotic interactions with mycorrhizal fungi, including legumes and some nonlegumes that also interact with endosymbiotic nitrogen (N)-fixing bacteria to form nodules. In addition to these helpful interactions, plants are continuously exposed to would-be pathogenic microbes: discriminating between friends and foes is a major determinant of plant survival. Recent breakthroughs have revealed how some key signals from pathogens and symbionts are distinguished. Once this checkpoint has been passed and a compatible symbiont is recognized, the plant coordinates the sequential development of two types of specialized structures in the host. The first serves to mediate infection, and the second, which appears later, serves as sophisticated intracellular nutrient exchange interfaces. The overlap in both the signaling pathways and downstream infection components of these symbioses reflects their evolutionary relatedness and the common requirements of these two interactions. However, the different outputs of the symbioses, phosphate uptake versus N fixation, require fundamentally different components and physical environments and necessitated the recruitment of different master regulators, NODULE INCEPTION-LIKE PROTEINS, and PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSES, for nodulation and mycorrhization, respectively.
