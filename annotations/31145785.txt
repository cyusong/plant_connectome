Plant disease resistance is often under quantitative genetic control. Thus, in a given interaction, plant cellular responses to infection are influenced by resistance or susceptibility alleles at different loci. In this study, a genetic linkage analysis was used to address the complexity of the metabolic responses of Brassica napus roots to infection by Plasmodiophora brassicae. Metabolome profiling and pathogen quantification in a segregating progeny allowed a comparative mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in resistance and in metabolic adjustments. Distinct metabolic modules were associated with each resistance QTL, suggesting the involvement of different underlying cellular mechanisms. This approach highlighted the possible role of gluconasturtiin and two unknown metabolites in the resistance conferred by two QTLs on chromosomes C03 and C09, respectively. Only two susceptibility biomarkers (glycine and glutathione) were simultaneously linked to the three main resistance QTLs, suggesting the central role of these compounds in the interaction. By contrast, several genotype-specific metabolic responses to infection were genetically unconnected to resistance or susceptibility. Likewise, variations of root sugar profiles, which might have influenced pathogen nutrition, were not found to be related to resistance QTLs. This work illustrates how genetic metabolomics can help to understand plant stress responses and their possible links with disease.
