Several synthetic promoters containing a variety of commonly found cis-acting DNA sequence motifs were constructed to study the motif-motif and motif-protein interactions involved in gene expression in plants. Transient expression of the reporter gene gusA in tobacco leaves was used to demonstrate that several sequence elements can be arranged upstream of a basal promoter to function synergistically in enhancing gene expression. A cis-acting DNA motif could function as an activator by itself as well as a synergizing activator in the presence of other homologous as well as heterologous motifs in the neighbourhood. The function of a complex promoter comprising several activation motifs was arrested nearly completely in vivo, following titration with any one of the motifs. The results suggested a hierarchical assembly of several motif-binding factors, leading to the stabilization of the transcriptional complex formed on the TATA-box.
