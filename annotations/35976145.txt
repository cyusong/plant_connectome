Splicing of plant mitochondrial introns is facilitated by numerous nucleus-encoded protein factors. Although some splicing factors have been identified in plants, the mechanism underlying mitochondrial intron splicing remains largely unclear. In this study, we identified a small P-type pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein containing merely four PPR repeats, small PPR protein 2 (SPR2), which is required for the splicing of more than half of the introns in maize (Zea mays) mitochondria. Null mutations of Spr2 severely impair the splicing of 15 out of the 22 mitochondrial Group II introns, resulting in substantially decreased mature transcripts, which abolished the assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex I. Consequently, embryogenesis and endosperm development were arrested in the spr2 mutants. Yeast two-hybrid, luciferase complementation imaging, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and semi-in vivo pull-down analyses indicated that SPR2 interacts with small MutS-related domain protein PPR-SMR1, both of which are required for the splicing of 13 introns. In addition, SPR2 and/or PPR-SMR1 interact with other splicing factors, including PPR proteins EMPTY PERICARP16, PPR14, and chloroplast RNA splicing and ribosome maturation (CRM) protein Zm-mCSF1, which participate in the splicing of specific intron(s) of the 13 introns. These results prompt us to propose that SPR2/PPR-SMR1 serves as the core component of a splicing complex and possibly exerts the splicing function through a dynamic interaction with specific substrate recognizing PPR proteins in mitochondria.
