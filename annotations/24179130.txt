Stomatal cytokinesis defective1 (SCD1) encodes a putative Rab guanine nucleotide exchange factor that functions in membrane trafficking and is required for cytokinesis and cell expansion in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we show that the loss of SCD2 function disrupts cytokinesis and cell expansion and impairs fertility, phenotypes similar to those observed for scd1 mutants. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that SCD1 function is dependent upon SCD2 and that together these proteins are required for plasma membrane internalization. Further specifying the role of these proteins in membrane trafficking, SCD1 and SCD2 proteins were found to be associated with isolated clathrin-coated vesicles and to colocalize with clathrin light chain at putative sites of endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Together, these data suggest that SCD1 and SCD2 function in clathrin-mediated membrane transport, including plasma membrane endocytosis, required for cytokinesis and cell expansion.
