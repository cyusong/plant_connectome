Salt stress seriously affects plant growth and development. Through genetic screening, we identified and characterized an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>sensitive to salt1</i> (<i>ses1</i>) mutant. <i>SES1</i> was ubiquitously expressed and induced by salt treatment. The salt-sensitive phenotype of <i>ses1</i> was due neither to the overaccumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> nor to the suppression of salt tolerance-associated genes. <i>SES1</i> encoded an uncharacterized endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized protein. Coinciding with its subcellular distribution, <i>ses1</i> exhibited overactivation of unfolded protein response genes and was largely influenced by severe ER stress. Biochemical evidence revealed that SES1 functions as an important molecular chaperone to alleviate salt-induced ER stress. Furthermore, the ER stress sensor basic leucine zipper factor17 transactivated <i>SES1</i> by binding directly to its promoter region. These results provide insights into salt stress responses and ER homeostasis and shed light on the mechanism by which <i>SES1</i> modulates salt resistance.
