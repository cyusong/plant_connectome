Large-scale high throughput metabolomic technologies are indispensable components of systems biology in terms of discovering and defining the metabolite parts of the system. However, the lack of a plant metabolite spectral library limits the metabolite identification of plant metabolomic studies. Here, we have created a plant metabolite spectral library using 544 authentic standards, which increased the efficiency of identification for untargeted metabolomic studies. The process of creating the spectral library was described, and the mzVault library was deposited in the public repository for free download. Furthermore, based on the spectral library, we describe a process of creating a pseudo-targeted method, which was applied to a proof-of-concept study of Arabidopsis leaf extracts. As authentic standards become available, more metabolite spectra can be easily incorporated into the spectral library to improve the mzVault package.
