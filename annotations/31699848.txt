['31699848', 'SNF1-related protein kinases 2 (SnRK2s) are key signaling elements regulating  abscisic acid-dependent plant development and responses to environmental  stresses. Our previous data showed that the SnRK2-interacting Calcium Sensor  (SCS) inhibits SnRK2 activity. Use of alternative transcription start sites  located within the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtSCS gene results in two  in-frame transcripts and subsequently two proteins, that differ only by the  sequence position of the N terminus. We previously described the longer AtSCS-A,  and now describe the shorter AtSCS-B and compare the two isoforms. The two  isoforms differ substantially in their expression profiles in plant organs and in  response to environmental stresses, in their calcium binding properties, and in  their conformational dynamics in the presence and absence of Ca(2+) Only AtSCS-A  has the features of a calcium sensor. Both forms inhibit SnRK2 activity, but  while AtSCS-A requires calcium for inhibition, AtSCS-B does not. Analysis of  Arabidopsis plants stably expressing 35S::AtSCS-A-c-myc or 35S::AtSCS-B-c-myc in  the scs-1 knockout mutant background revealed that, in planta, both forms are  negative regulators of abscisic acid-induced SnRK2 activity and regulate plant  resistance against water deficit. Moreover, the data highlight biochemical,  biophysical, and functional properties of EF-hand-like motifs in plant proteins.', '2020 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00900', 'ORCID:']
