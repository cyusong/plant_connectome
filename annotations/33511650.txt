The whole-genome molecular mechanisms of melatonin (MT)-mediated enhancement of thermotolerance in plants has rarely been studied. In this study, the genome-wide gene expression profiles of kiwifruit seedlings primed with MT and non-MT at 45°C were analyzed by RNA-Seq. A total of 3299 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened between MT and non-MT treatment, in which carotenoid biosynthesis was one of the high-enrichment pathways revealed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. Further, qRT-PCR verified that MT significantly induced the upregulated expression of the carotenoid biosynthesis gene, which was consistent with the increase of carotenoid content. In addition, 10 heat shock proteins (HSPs) were identified to have a highly upregulated expression by MT. These findings provide a set of informative and fundamental data on the role of MT in heat resistance.
