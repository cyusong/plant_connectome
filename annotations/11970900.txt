['11970900', 'Plant steroid hormones, brassinosteroids (BRs), are perceived by a cell surface  receptor kinase, BRI1, but how BR binding leads to regulation of gene expression  in the nucleus is unknown. Here we describe the identification of BZR1 as a  nuclear component of the BR signal transduction pathway. A dominant mutation  bzr1-1D suppresses BR-deficient and BR-insensitive (bri1) phenotypes and enhances  feedback inhibition of BR biosynthesis. BZR1 protein accumulates in the nucleus  of elongating cells of dark-grown hypocotyls and is stabilized by BR signaling  and the bzr1-1D mutation. Our results demonstrate that BZR1 is a positive  regulator of the BR signaling pathway that mediates both downstream BR responses  and feedback regulation of BR biosynthesis.', '2002 Apr', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/s1534-5807(02)00153-3', 'Chory']
