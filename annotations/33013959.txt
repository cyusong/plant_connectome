<i>Spatholobus suberectus</i> Dunn (<i>S. suberectus</i>), has been widely used in traditional medicines plant source of the Leguminosae family. Its vine stem of which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of various diseases because it contains various flavonoids. Comparative genome analysis suggested well-conserved genomic components and genetic collinearity between the genome of <i>S. suberectus</i> and other genera of Leguminosae such as <i>Glycine max</i>. We discovered two whole genome duplications (WGD) events in <i>S. suberectus</i> and <i>G. max</i> lineage underwent a WGD after speciation from <i>S. suberectus.</i> The determination of expansion and contractions of orthologous gene families revealed 1,001 expanded gene families and 3,649 contracted gene families in the <i>S. suberectus</i> lineage. Comparing to the model plants, many novel flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes were predicted in the genome of <i>S. suberectus</i>, and the expression patterns of these genes in the roots are similar to those in the stems [such as the isoflavone synthase (<i>IFS</i>) genes]. The expansion of <i>IFS</i> from a single copy in the Leguminosae ancestor to four copies in <i>S. suberectus</i>, will accelerate the biosynthesis of flavonoids. <i>MYB</i> genes are widely involved in plant flavonoid biosynthesis and the most abundant member of the TF family in <i>S. suberectus</i>. Activated retrotransponson positive regulates the accumulation of flavonoid in <i>S. suberectus</i> by introducing the cis-elements of tissue-specific expressed <i>MYBs</i>. Our study not only provides significant insight into the evolution of specific flavonoid biosynthetic pathways in <i>S. suberectus</i>, but also would facilitate the development of tools for enhancing bioactive productivity by metabolic engineering in microbes or by molecular breeding for alleviating resource shortage of <i>S. suberectus</i>.
