Root cells take up K<sup>+</sup> from the soil solution, and a fraction of the absorbed K<sup>+</sup> is translocated to the shoot after being loaded into xylem vessels. K<sup>+</sup> uptake and translocation are spatially separated processes. K<sup>+</sup> uptake occurs in the cortex and epidermis whereas K<sup>+</sup> translocation starts at the stele. Both uptake and translocation processes are expected to be linked, but the connection between them is not well characterized. Here, we studied K<sup>+</sup> uptake and translocation using Rb<sup>+</sup> as a tracer in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and in T-DNA insertion mutants in the K<sup>+</sup> uptake or translocation systems. The relative amount of translocated Rb<sup>+</sup> to the shoot was positively correlated with net Rb<sup>+</sup> uptake rates, and the akt1 athak5 T-DNA mutant plants were more efficient in their allocation of Rb<sup>+</sup> to shoots. Moreover, a mutation of SKOR and a reduced plant transpiration prevented the full upregulation of AtHAK5 gene expression and Rb<sup>+</sup> uptake in K<sup>+</sup> -starved plants. Lastly, Rb<sup>+</sup> was found to be retrieved from root xylem vessels, with AKT1 playing a significant role in K<sup>+</sup> -sufficient plants. Overall, our results suggest that K<sup>+</sup> uptake and translocation are tightly coordinated via signals that regulate the expression of K<sup>+</sup> transport systems.
