['29877165', 'Plants are naturally resistant to most pathogens through a broad and durable  defense response called nonhost disease resistance. Nonhost disease resistance is  a complex process that includes preformed physical and chemical barriers and  induced responses. In spite of its importance, many components of nonhost disease  resistance remain to be identified and characterized. Using virus-induced gene  silencing in Nicotiana benthamiana, we discovered a novel gene that we named  NbNHR2 (N. benthamiana nonhost resistance 2). NbNHR2-silenced plants were  susceptible to the nonadapted pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato T1, which  does not cause disease in wild-type or nonsilenced N. benthamiana plants. We  found two orthologous genes in Arabidopsis thaliana: AtNHR2A and AtNHR2B. Similar  to the results obtained in N. benthamiana, Atnhr2a and Atnhr2b mutants were  susceptible to the nonadapted bacterial pathogen of A. thaliana, P. syringae pv.  tabaci. We further found that these mutants were also defective in callose  deposition. AtNHR2A and AtNHR2B fluorescent protein fusions transiently expressed  in N. benthamiana localized predominantly to chloroplasts and a few unidentified  dynamic puncta. RFP-AtNHR2A and AtNHR2B-GFP displayed overlapping signals in  chloroplasts, indicating that the two proteins could interact, an idea supported  by coimmunoprecipitation studies. We propose that AtNHR2A and AtNHR2B are new  components of a chloroplast-signaling pathway that activates callose deposition  to the cell wall in response to bacterial pathogens.', '2018 Dec', 'Mol Plant Microbe Interact', '10.1094/MPMI-04-18-0094-R', 'Mysore']
