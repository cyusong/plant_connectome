Rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the cell surface has been implicated in plant defence responses. Genetic evidence indicates that a plant NADPH oxidase (Rboh; respiratory burst oxidase homologue) is associated with oxidative burst. However, there is not enough physiological evidence of Rboh localization available yet. Isozyme-specific antibodies against potato StrbohA and StrbohB (St; Solanum tuberosum) were prepared to investigate the localization of these proteins. Immunoblot analyses using potato microsomal proteins revealed that StrbohA was expressed constitutively at a low level, whereas the accumulation of StrbohB protein was induced by the cell wall elicitor of the potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans. It is demonstrated here that StrbohA and StrbohB are distributed in plasma membrane fractions which have been separated by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation using their specific antibodies. Green fluorescent protein-tagged Strboh proteins were also located on the plasma membrane by transient expression assay in onion epidermal cells. Additionally, NADPH-dependent O2(-)-generating activities in plasma membrane fractions were diphenylene iodonium-sensitive and NaN3-insensitive. These data suggest that StrbohA and StrbohB are predominantly localized on the plasma membrane and regulate ROS production in defence signalling.
