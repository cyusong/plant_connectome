['16289945', 'Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is now recognised as a key signalling molecule in  eukaryotes. In plants, H2O2 is involved in regulating stomatal closure,  gravitropic responses, gene expression and programmed cell death. Although  several kinases, such as oxidative signal-inducible 1 (OXI1) kinase and  mitogen-activated protein kinases are known to be activated by exogenous H2O2,  little is known about the proteins that directly react with H2O2. Here, we  utilised a proteomic approach, using iodoacetamide-based fluorescence tagging of  proteins in conjunction with mass spectrometric analysis, to identify several  proteins that might be potential targets of H2O2 in the cytosolic fraction of  Arabidopsis thaliana, the most prominent of which was cytosolic glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate dehydrogenase (cGAPDH; EC 1.2.1.12). cGAPDH from Arabidopsis is  inactivated by H2O2 in vitro, and this inhibition is reversible by the subsequent  addition of reductants such as reduced glutathione (GSH). It has been suggested  recently that Arabidopsis GAPDH has roles outside of its catalysis as part of  glycolysis, while in other systems this includes that of mediating reactive  oxygen species (ROS) signalling. Here, we suggest that cGAPDH in Arabidopsis  might also have such a role in mediating ROS signalling in plants.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2005.07.012', 'Neill']
