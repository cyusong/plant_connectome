The time delay in receiving conventional tissue nutrient analysis results caused red raspberry (<i>Rubus idaeus</i> L.) growers to be interested in rapid sap tests to provide real-time results to guide immediate nutrient management practices. However, sap analysis has never been conducted in raspberry. The present work aimed to evaluate the relationship of petiole sap nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>), potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) concentrations measured using compact ion meters and leaf tissue total nitrogen (TN), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) concentrations measured using conventional tissue nutrient analysis. The relationship of petiole sap NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> and leaf tissue TN concentrations with plant growth and production variables was also explored. Fertilizer treatments of urea were surface applied to raised beds of established "Meeker" floricane red raspberry plots at control, low, medium, and high rates (0, 34, 67, and 101 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) in 2019 and 2020. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Whole leaves were collected from representative primocanes in mid- and late- July and August 2019 and 2020 (i.e., four sampling time points per year). At each sampling time point, a subsample of leaves was used for petiole sap analyses of NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations using compact ion meters, and conventional tissue testing of leaf tissue TN, K, and Ca concentrations, respectively. There were no interactions between N fertilizer rate and year nor between N fertilizer rate and sampling time. No significant differences were found due to N fertilizer rate for petiole sap NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> nor leaf tissue TN, K, Ca concentrations. However, significant year and sampling time effects occurred in measured petiole sap and leaf tissue nutrient concentrations. Overall, the correlations between petiole sap NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> and leaf tissue TN, petiole sap Ca<sup>2+</sup> and leaf tissue Ca, petiole sap K<sup>+</sup> and leaf tissue K concentrations were non-strong and inconsistent. Future research is warranted as the interpretation of correlations between raspberry petiole sap and leaf tissue nutrient concentrations were inconclusive.
