['20190079', "In mitochondria of higher plants, the majority of 5' termini of mature mRNAs are  generated posttranscriptionally. To gain insight into this process, we analyzed a  natural 5' end polymorphism in the species Arabidopsis thaliana. This genetic  approach identified the nuclear gene At1g62670, encoding a pentatricopeptide  repeat protein. The functional importance of this mitochondrial restorer of  fertility-like protein, designated RNA PROCESSING FACTOR2 (RPF2), is confirmed by  the analysis of a respective T-DNA knockout mutant and its functional restoration  by in vivo complementation. RPF2 fulfills two functions: it is required for the  generation of a distinct 5' terminus of transcripts of subunit 9 of the NADH  DEHYDROGENASE complex (nad9) and it determines the efficiency of 5' end formation  of the mRNAs for subunit 3 of the CYTOCHROME C OXIDASE (cox3), the latter also  being influenced by mitochondrial DNA sequences. Accordingly, recombinant RPF2  protein directly binds to a nad9 mRNA fragment in vitro. Two-dimensional gel  electrophoresis and immunodetection analyses reveal that altered 5' processing  does not influence accumulation of the nad9 and cox3 polypeptides. In accessions  C24, Oystese-1, and Yosemite-0, different inactive RPF2 alleles exist,  demonstrating the variability of this gene in Arabidopsis. The identification of  RPF2 is a major step toward the characterization of 5' mRNA processing in  mitochondria of higher plants.", '2010 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.066944', 'Binder']
