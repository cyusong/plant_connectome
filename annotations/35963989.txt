As maize originated in tropical or subtropical zones, most maize germplasm is extremely sensitive to low temperatures during the seedling stage. Clarifying the molecular mechanism of cold acclimation would facilitate the breeding of cold tolerant maize varieties, which is one of the major sustainability factors for crop production. To meet this goal, we investigated two maize inbred lines with contrasting levels of cold tolerance at the seedling stage (IL85, a cold tolerant line; B73, a cold sensitive line), and performed full-length transcriptome sequencing on the root tips of seedlings before and after 24 h of cold treatment. We identified 152,263 transcripts, including 20,993 novel transcripts, and determined per-transcript expression levels. A total of 1,475 transcripts were specifically up-regulated in the cold tolerant line IL85 under cold stress. GO enrichment analysis revealed that 25 transcripts were involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic processes and 15 transcripts were related to the response to heat. Eight genes showed specific differential alternative splicing (DAS) in IL85 under cold stress, and were mainly involved in amine metabolism. A total of 1,111 lncRNAs were further identified, 62 of which were up-regulated in IL85 or B73 under cold stress, and their corresponding target genes were enriched in protein phosphorylation. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of cold acclimation during the seedling stage in maize, and will facilitate the development of cultivars with improved cold stress tolerance.
