['23551974', 'The Arabidopsis mutant shm1-1 is defective in mitochondrial serine  hydroxymethyltransferase 1 activity and displays a lethal photorespiratory  phenotype at ambient CO2 concentration but grows normally at high CO2 . After  transferring high CO2 -grown shm1-1 plants to ambient CO2 , the younger leaves  remain photosynthetically active while developed leaves display increased  yellowing and decreased FV /FM values. Metabolite analysis of plants transferred  from high CO2 to ambient air indicates a massive light-dependent  (photorespiratory) accumulation of glycine, 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and  D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). Amino acid markers of senescence accumulated in  ambient air in wild-type and shm1-1 plants maintained in darkness and also build  up in shm1-1 in the light. This, together with an enhanced transcription of the  senescence marker SAG12 in shm1-1, suggests the initiation of senescence in  shm1-1 under photorespiratory conditions. Mitochondrial D-2HG dehydrogenase  (D-2HGDH) converts D-2HG into 2OG. In vitro studies indicate that 2OG exerts  competitive inhibition on D-2HGDH with a Ki of 1.96 mm. 2OG is therefore a  suitable candidate as inhibitor of the in vivo D-2HGDH activity, as 2OG is  produced and accumulates in mitochondria. Inhibition of the D-2HGDH by 2OG is  likely a mechanism by which D-2HG accumulates in shm1-1, however it cannot be  ruled out that D-2HG may also accumulate due to an active senescence programme  that is initiated in these plants after transfer to photorespiratory conditions.  Thus, a novel interaction of the photorespiratory pathway with cellular processes  involving D-2HG has been identified.', '2013 Jul', 'Plant Biol (Stuttg)', '10.1111/plb.12020', 'Maurino']
