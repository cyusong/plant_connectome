Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is one of the most commercially important fiber crops in the world. Compared with other crops, cotton represents a recalcitrant species for regeneration protocols. The development of efficient and rapid regeneration protocol for elite Indian cotton variety could help improve the quality characteristics and biotic or abiotic stress tolerance. Here we report a novel regeneration protocol in Indian cotton cultivar Narashima. The maximum number of multiple shoots obtained was 16 per explants, performance which has never been achieved in any prior reports. The embryo apex explants were isolated from 2 d old in vitro growing seedlings. Explants were cultured on MS medium containing different plant growth regulator combinations in order to induce multiple shoots. Among the tested combinations, the 2 mg/l of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 2 mg/l kinetin (KIN) proved to be most suited for achieving the maximum number of multiple shoots. The elongation of multiple shoots was obtained in media supplemented with gibberellic acid (GA3). The regenerated plants were successfully hardened in earthen pots after adequate acclimatization. This method avoids callus tissue, the stage of regeneration which may lead to somaclonal variation. The important feature of the presented method is shortening of regeneration time, as well as the induction of a high number of multiple shoots per explants. The present protocol may provide an efficient and rapid regeneration tool for obtaining more stable transformants from embryo apex explants of Indian cotton cultivar Narashima.
