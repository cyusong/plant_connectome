FE UPTAKE-INDUCING PEPTIDE1 (FEP1), also named IRON MAN3 (IMA3) is a short peptide involved in the iron deficiency response in Arabidopsis thaliana. Recent studies uncovered its molecular function, but its physiological function in the systemic Fe response is not fully understood. To explore the physiological function of FEP1 in iron homoeostasis, we performed a transcriptome analysis using the FEP1 loss-of-function mutant fep1-1 and a transgenic line with oestrogen-inducible expression of FEP1. We determined that FEP1 specifically regulates several iron deficiency-responsive genes, indicating that FEP1 participates in iron translocation rather than iron uptake in roots. The iron concentration in xylem sap under iron-deficient conditions was lower in the fep1-1 mutant and higher in FEP1-induced transgenic plants compared with the wild type (WT). Perls staining revealed a greater accumulation of iron in the cortex of fep1-1 roots than in the WT root cortex, although total iron levels in roots were comparable in the two genotypes. Moreover, the fep1-1 mutation partially suppressed the iron overaccumulation phenotype in the leaves of the oligopeptide transporter3-2 (opt3-2) mutant. These data suggest that FEP1 plays a pivotal role in iron movement and in maintaining the iron quota in vascular tissues in Arabidopsis.
