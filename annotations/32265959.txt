<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is being transformed from a model organism to an industrial organism for the production of pigments, fatty acids, and pharmaceuticals. Genetic modification has been used to increase the economic value of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. However, low gene-editing efficiency and position-effects hinder the genetic improvement of this microorganism. Recently, site-specific double-stranded DNA cleavage using CRISPR-Cas9 system has been applied to regulate a metabolic pathway in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. In this study, we proved that site-specific gene expression can be induced by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated double-strand cleavage and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) mechanism. The CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knock-in method was adopted to improve gene-editing efficiency and express the reporter gene on the intended site. Knock-in was performed using a combination of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and DNA fragment (antibiotics resistance gene). Gene-editing efficiency was improved via optimization of a component of RNP complex. We found that when the gene <i>CrFTSY</i> was targeted, the efficiency of obtaining the desired mutant by the knock-in method combined with antibiotic resistance was nearly 37%; 2.5 times higher than the previous reports. Additionally, insertion of a long DNA fragment (3.2 and 6.4 kb) and site-specific gene expression were analyzed. We demonstrated the knock-out phenotype of <i>CrFTSY</i> and on-site inserted gene expression of luciferase and mVenus at the same time. This result showed that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knock-in can be used to express the gene of interest avoiding position-effects in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. This report could provide a new perspective to the use of gene-editing. Furthermore, the technical improvements in genetic modification may accelerate the commercialization of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>.
