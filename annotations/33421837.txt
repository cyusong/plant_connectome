Most CO<sub>2</sub> on Earth is fixed into organic matter via reactions catalysed by enzymes called carboxylases. CO<sub>2</sub>-fixation via carboxylases occurs in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, and the crucial role in this cycle is played by RubisCO (D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase). CO<sub>2</sub> can also be fixed by pathways, where a reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to formate or carbon monoxide (CO) occurs. The latter reactions are performed by so-called CO<sub>2</sub>-reductases e.g. formate dehydrogenase (FDH), carbon-monooxide (CO) dehydrogenase (CODH), and crotonyl-CoA reductase/carboxylase (CCR). In general, a simple model of enzymatic activity based only on a turnover rate of an enzyme for an appropriate substrate (k<sub>cat</sub>) is insufficient. Based on estimated metabolic costs of each amino acid, the average energetic costs of amino acid biosynthesis (E<sub>aa</sub>), and the total costs (E<sub>T</sub>) for selected CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing enzymes were analyzed concerning 1) k<sub>cat</sub> for CO<sub>2</sub> (k<sub>C</sub>), and 2) specificity factor (S<sub>rel</sub>) for RubisCO. A comparison of E<sub>aa</sub> and E<sub>T</sub> to their k<sub>C</sub> showed that CODH and FDHs do not need to be more efficient enzymes in CO<sub>2</sub> capturing pathways than some forms of RubisCO. CCR was the only both low-cost and highly active CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing enzyme. The obtained results showed also that there exists an evolutionarily conserved trade-off between S<sub>rel</sub> of RubisCOs and the energetic demands needed for their biosynthesis. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that RubisCO, CODH, FDH, and CCR are enzymes formed as a result of parallel evolution. Moreover, the kinetic parameters (k<sub>C</sub>) of CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing enzymes were plausibly optimized already at the early stages of life evolution on Earth.
