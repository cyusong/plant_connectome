Climate change will negatively affect crop production by exacerbating the incidence of disease and decreasing the efficacy of conventional approaches to disease control. Nanotechnology is a promising new strategy for plant disease management that has many advantages over conventional products and approaches, such as better efficacy, reduced input requirements, and lower eco-toxicity. Studies on crop plants using various nanomaterials (NMs) as protective agents have produced promising results. This review focuses on the use of NMs in disease management through three different mechanisms: (i) as antimicrobial agents; (ii) as biostimulants that induce plant innate immunity; and (iii) as carriers for active ingredients such as pesticides, micronutrients, and elicitors. The potential benefits of nanotechnology are considered, together with the role that NMs might play in future disease management and crop adaptation measures.
