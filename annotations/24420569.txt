The phloem is the long-distance solute-conducting tissue of plants. The observation of phloem cells is particularly challenging for several reasons and many recent advances in microscopy are, therefore, especially beneficial for the study of phloem anatomy and physiology. This review will give an overview of the imaging techniques that have been used for studying different aspects of phloem biology. It will also highlight some new imaging techniques that have emerged in recent years that will certainly advance our knowledge about phloem function.
