['30774641', 'The circadian system ensures that plants respond appropriately to environmental  change by predicting regular transitions that occur during diel cycles. In order  to be most useful, the circadian system needs to be compensated against daily and  seasonal changes in temperature that would otherwise alter the pace of this  biological oscillator. We demonstrate that an evening-phased protein, the  putative histone demethylase JMJD5, contributes to temperature compensation.  JMJD5 is co-expressed with components of the Evening Complex, an agglomeration of  proteins including EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3), ELF4, and LUX ARRHYTHYMO (LUX), which  also integrates temperature changes into the molecular clockwork. One role of the  Evening Complex is to regulate expression of PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR9 (PRR9) and  PRR7, important components of the temperature compensation mechanism.  Surprisingly we find that LUX, but not other Evening Complex components, is  dispensable for clock function at low temperatures. Further genetic analysis  suggests JMJD5 acts in a parallel pathway to LUX within the circadian system.  Although an intact JMJD5 catalytic domain is required for its function within the  clock, our findings suggest JMJD5 does not directly regulate H3K36 methylation at  circadian loci. Such data refine our understanding of how JMDJ5 acts within the  Arabidopsis circadian system.', '2019', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2019.00057', 'Harmer']
