['16980538', 'DNA replication in cycling eukaryotic cells necessitates the reestablishment of  chromatin after nucleosome redistribution from the parental to the two daughter  DNA strands. Chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), a heterotrimeric complex  consisting of three subunits (p150/p60/p48), is one of the replication-coupled  assembly factors involved in the reconstitution of S-phase chromatin. CAF-1 is  required in vitro for nucleosome assembly onto newly replicated chromatin in  human cells and Arabidopsis thaliana, and defects in yeast (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae) affect DNA damage repair processes, predominantly those involved in  genome stability. However, in vivo chromatin defects of caf-1 mutants in higher  eukaryotes are poorly characterized. Here, we show that fasciata1-4 (fas1-4), a  new allele of the Arabidopsis fas1 mutant defective in the p150 subunit of CAF-1,  has a severe developmental phenotype, reduced heterochromatin content, and a more  open conformation of euchromatin. Most importantly, homologous recombination  (HR), a process involved in maintaining genome stability, is increased  dramatically in fas1-4, as indicated by a 96-fold stimulation of intrachromosomal  HR. Together with the open conformation of chromatin and the nearly normal  expression levels of HR genes in the mutant, this result suggests that chromatin  is a major factor restricting HR in plants.', '2006 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.045088', 'Reiss']
