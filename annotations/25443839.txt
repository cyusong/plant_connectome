['25443839', 'To characterize the recently described SCI1 (stigma/style cell cycle inhibitor 1)  gene relationship with the auxin pathway, we have taken the advantage of the  Arabidopsis model system and its available tools. At first, we have analyzed the  At1g79200 T-DNA insertion mutants and constructed various transgenic plants. The  loss- and gain-of-function plants displayed cell number alterations in upper  pistils that were controlled by the amino-terminal domain of the protein. These  data also confirmed that this locus holds the functional homolog (AtSCI1) of the  Nicotiana tabacum SCI1 gene. Then, we have provided some evidences the auxin  synthesis/signaling pathways are required for downstream proper AtSCI1 control of  cell number: (a) its expression is downregulated in yuc2yuc6 and npy1  auxin-deficient mutants, (b) triple (yuc2yuc6sci1) and double (npy1sci1) mutants  mimicked the auxin-deficient phenotypes, with no synergistic interactions, and  (c) the increased upper pistil phenotype in these last mutants, which is a  consequence of an increased cell number, was able to be complemented by AtSCI1  overexpression. Taken together, our data strongly suggests SCI1 as a component of  the auxin signaling transduction pathway to control cell  proliferation/differentiation in stigma/style, representing a molecular effector  of this hormone on pistil development.', '2014 Dec', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.09.003', 'Goldman']
