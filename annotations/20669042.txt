['20669042', 'Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are a diverse family of proteins that have  specialized roles in secondary metabolism and in normal cell development. Two  P450s in particular, CYP734A1 and CYP72C1, have been identified as  brassinosteroid-inactivating enzymes important for steroid-mediated signal  transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana. Genetic analyses have demonstrated that  these P450s modulate growth throughout plant development. While members of the  CYP734A subfamily inactivate brassinosteroids through C-26 hydroxylation, the  biochemical activity of CYP72C1 is unknown. Because CYP734A1 and CYP72C1 in  Arabidopsis diverge more than brassinosteroid inactivating P450s in other plants,  this study examines the structure and biochemistry of each enzyme.  Three-dimensional models were generated to examine the substrate binding site  structures and determine how they might affect the function of each P450. These  models have indicated that the active site of CYP72C1 does not contain several  conserved amino acids typically needed for substrate hydroxylation. Heterologous  expression of these P450s followed by substrate binding analyses have indicated  that CYP734A1 binds active brassinosteroids, brassinolide and castasterone, as  well as their upstream precursors whereas CYP72C1 binds precursors more  effectively. Seedling growth assays have demonstrated that the genetic state of  CYP734A1, but not CYP72C1, affected responsiveness to high levels of exogenous  brassinolide supporting our observations that CYP72C1 acts on brassinolide  precursors. Although there may be some overlap in their physiological function,  the distinct biochemical functions of these proteins in Arabidopsis has  significant potential to fine-tune the levels of different brassinosteroid  hormones throughout plant growth and development.', '2010 Sep', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-010-9663-y', 'Neff']
