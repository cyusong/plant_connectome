The overexpression of RXam1 leads to a reduction in bacterial growth of XamCIO136, suggesting that RXam1 might be implicated in strain-specific resistance. Cassava bacterial blight (CBB) caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam) is a prevalent disease in all regions, where cassava is cultivated. CBB is a foliar and vascular disease usually controlled through host resistance. Previous studies have found QTLs explaining resistance to several Xam strains. Interestingly, one QTL called XM5 that explained 13% of resistance to XamCIO136 was associated with a similar fragment of the rice Xa21-resistance gene called PCR250. In this study, we aimed to further identify and characterize this fragment and its role in resistance to CBB. Screening and hybridization of a BAC library using the molecular marker PCR250 as a probe led to the identification of a receptor-like kinase similar to Xa21 and were called RXam1 (Resistance to Xam 1). Here, we report the functional characterization of susceptible cassava plants overexpressing RXam1. Our results indicated that the overexpression of RXam1 leads to a reduction in bacterial growth of XamCIO136. This suggests that RXAM1 might be implicated in strain-specific resistance to XamCIO136.
