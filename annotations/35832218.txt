Despite its high economical and ornamental values, <i>Torreya grandis</i>, a dioecious non-timber coniferous species, has long been an underrepresented species. However, the advent and application of advanced genotyping technologies have stimulated its genetic research, making it possible to gain new insight into the genetic architecture of complex traits that may not be detected for model species. We apply an open-pollination (OP) mapping strategy to conduct a QTL mapping experiment of <i>T. grandis</i>, in which nearly 100 unrelated trees randomly chosen from the species' natural distribution and their half-sib progeny are simultaneously genotyped. This strategy allows us to simultaneously estimate the recombination fractions and linkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficients between each pair of markers. We reconstruct a high-density linkage map of 4,203 SNPs covering a total distance of 8,393.95 cM and plot pairwise normalized LD values against genetic distances to build up a linkage-LD map. We identify 13 QTLs for stem basal diameter growth and 4 QTLs for stem height growth in juvenile seedlings. From the linkage-LD map, we infer the evolutionary history of <i>T. grandis</i> and each of its QTLs. The slow decay of QTL-related LDs indicates that these QTLs and their harboring genomic regions are evolutionarily relatively young, suggesting that they can better utilized by clonal propagation rather than through seed propagation. Genetic results from the OP sampling strategy could provide useful guidance for genetic studies of other dioecious species.
