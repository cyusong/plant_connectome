Biogenesis of plant microRNAs (miRNAs) takes place in nuclear dicing bodies (D-bodies), where the ribonulease III-type enzyme Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) processes primary transcripts of miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) into miRNA/miRNA* (*, passenger strand) duplexes from either base-to-loop or loop-to-base directions. Hyponastic Leaves 1 (HYL1), a double-stranded RNA-binding protein, is crucial for efficient and accurate processing. However, whether HYL1 has additional function remains unknown. Here, we report that HYL1 plays a noncanonical role in protecting pri-miRNAs from nuclear exosome attack in addition to ensuring processing. Loss of functions in SOP1 or HEN2, two cofactors of the nucleoplasmic exosome, significantly suppressed the morphological phenotypes of <i>hyl1-2</i> Remarkably, mature miRNAs generated from loop-to-base processing were partially but preferentially restored in the <i>hyl1 sop1</i> and <i>hyl1 hen2</i> double mutants. Accordingly, loop-to-base-processed pri-miRNAs accumulated to higher levels in double mutants. In addition, dysfunction of HEN2, but not of SOP1, in <i>hyl1-2</i> resulted in overaccumulation of many base-to-loop-processed pri-miRNAs, with most of their respective miRNAs unaffected. In summary, our findings reveal an antagonistic action of exosome in pri-miRNA biogenesis and uncover dual roles of HYL1 in stabilizing and processing of pri-miRNAs.
