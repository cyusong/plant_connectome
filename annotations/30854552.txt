Increasing the potassium use efficiency (KUE) of crops is important for agricultural sustainability. However, a greater understanding of this complex trait is required to develop new, high-KUE cultivars. To this end, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was applied to diverse rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes grown under potassium-stressed and -replete conditions. Using high-stringency criteria, the genetic architecture of KUE was uncovered, together with the breadth of physiological responses to low-potassium stress. Specifically, three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, which contained >90 candidate genes. Of these, the sodium transporter gene OsHKT2;1 emerged as a key factor that impacts on KUE based on (i) the correlation between shoot Na+ and KUE, and (ii) higher levels of HKT2;1 expression in high-KUE lines.
