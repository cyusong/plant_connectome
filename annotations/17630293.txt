The SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (SERK1) gene is expressed in the procambium of the vascular bundles in roots, hypocotyls, and inflorescence stems. In younger parts of roots and hypocotyls, SERK1 expression was less restricted and was also observed in protoxylem cells, immature metaxylem cells and phloem companion cells. In roots, SERK1 expression was first detected in root vascular stem cells and was notably absent from the QC. In general, the SERK1 protein level as visualized by expression of a SERK1-YFP fusion protein closely followed the pattern of gene expression. In hypocotyls, prolonged application of 2,4-D resulted in extensive unorganized proliferation of SERK1 expressing cells originating from the procambium and pericycle. In roots, 2,4-D treatment results in an increase in SERK1 transcription that results in a moderate increase in the amount of SERK1-YFP fusion protein. The restricted vascular pattern of SERK1 expression in roots remains unaffected after 2,4-D treatment.
