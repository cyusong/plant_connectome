A glasshouse experiment was designed to investigate the effect of the co-occurrence of 400 and 700ppm CO<sub>2</sub> at 0, 15 and 45mM Cu on the Cu-tolerance of C<sub>4</sub> cordgrass species Spartina densiflora, by measuring growth, gas exchange, efficiency of PSII, pigments profiles, antioxidative enzyme activities and nutritional balance. Our results revealed that the rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> mitigated growth reduction imposed by Cu in plants grown at 45mM Cu, leading to leaf Cu concentration bellow than 270mgKg<sup>-1</sup> Cu, caused by an evident dilution effect. On the other hand, non-CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment plants showed leaf Cu concentration values up to 737.5mgKg<sup>-1</sup> Cu. Furthermore, improved growth was associated with higher net photosynthetic rate (A<sub>N</sub>). The beneficial effect of rising CO<sub>2</sub> on photosynthetic apparatus seems to be associated with a reduction of stomatal limitation imposed by Cu excess, which allowed these plants to maintain greater <sub>i</sub>WUE values. Also, plants grown at 45mM Cu and 700ppm CO<sub>2</sub>, showed higher ETR values and lower energy dissipation, which could be linked with an induction of Rubisco carboxylation and supported by the recorded amelioration of N imbalance. Furthermore, higher ETR values under CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment could lead to an additional consumption of reducing equivalents. Idea that was reflected in the lower values of ETR<sub>max</sub>/A<sub>N</sub> ratio, malondialdehyde (MDA) and ascorbate peroxidase (APx), guaiacol peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities under Cu excess, which could indicate a lower production of ROS species under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, due to a better use of absorbed energy.
