The formation of cell polarity is essential for many developmental processes such as polar cell growth and spatial patterning of cell division. A plant-specific ROP (<u>R</u>h<u>o</u>-like GTPases from <u>P</u>lants) subfamily of conserved Rho GTPase plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell polarity. However, the functional study of ROPs in angiosperm is challenging because of their functional redundancy. The <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> genome encodes a single <i>ROP</i> gene, Mp<i>ROP</i>, providing an excellent genetic system to study ROP-dependent signaling pathways. Mp<i>rop</i> knockout mutants exhibited rhizoid growth defects, and MpROP was localized at the tip of elongating rhizoids, establishing a role for MpROP in the control of polar cell growth and its functional conservation in plants. Furthermore, the Mp<i>rop</i> knockout mutant showed defects in the formation of meristem notches associated with disorganized cell division patterns. These results reveal a critical function of Mp<i>ROP</i> in the regulation of plant development. Interestingly, these phenotypes were complemented not only by Mp<i>ROP</i> but also <i>Arabidopsis</i> At<i>ROP2</i>, supporting the conservation of ROP's function among land plants. Our results demonstrate a great potential for <i>M. polymorpha</i> as a powerful genetic system for functional and mechanistic elucidation of ROP signaling pathways during plant development.
