Controlling the distribution of stomata is crucial for the adaptation of plants to new, or changing environments. While many plant species produce stomata predominantly on the abaxial leaf surface (hypostomy), some produce stomata on both surfaces (amphistomy), and the remaining few produce them only on the adaxial surface (hyperstomy). Various selective pressures have driven the evolution of these three modes of stomatal distribution. Despite recent advances in our understanding of stomatal development and dorsiventral leaf polarity, the genetic basis for the evolution of different stomatal distributions is still unclear. Here, we propose the genus <i>Callitriche</i> as a new model system to investigate patterns in the evolution of stomatal distribution. <i>Callitriche</i> comprises species with diverse lifestyles, including terrestrial, amphibious, and obligately aquatic plants. We found that species in this genus cover all three modes of dorsiventral stomatal distribution, making it a desirable model for comparative and evolutionary analyses on distribution modes. We further characterized the genetic basis of the different distribution modes, focusing on the stomatal key transcription factor SPEECHLESS. Future research using the promising model system <i>Callitriche</i> would open a new direction for evolutionary developmental biology studies on stomata.
