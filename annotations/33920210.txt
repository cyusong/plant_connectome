Peppers (<i>Capsicum annuum</i> L.) are the most widespread and cultivated species of Solanaceae in subtropical and temperate countries. These vegetables are economically attractive worldwide. Although whole-genome sequences of peppers and genome-editing tools are currently available, the precision editing of peppers is still in its infancy because of the lack of a stable pepper transformation method. Here, we employed three <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strains-AGL1, EHA101, and GV3101-to investigate which <i>Agrobacterium</i> strain could be used for pepper transformation. Hot pepper CM334 and bell pepper Dempsey were chosen in this study. <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> GV3101 induced the highest number of calli in cv. Dempsey. All three strains generated similar numbers of calli for cv. CM334. We optimized a suitable concentration of phosphinothricin (PPT) to select a CRISPR/Cas9 binary vector (pBAtC) for both pepper types. Finally, we screened transformed calli for PPT resistance (1 and 5 mg/L PPT for cv. CM334 and Dempsey, respectively). These selected calli showed different indel frequencies from the non-transformed calli. However, the primary indel pattern was consistent with a 1-bp deletion at the target locus of the <i>C. annuum</i><i>MLO</i> gene (<i>CaMLO2</i>). These results demonstrate the different sensitivity between cv. CM334 and Dempsey to <i>A. tumefaciens</i>-mediated callus induction, and a differential selection pressure of PPT via pBAtC binary vector.
