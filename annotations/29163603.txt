['29163603', 'Fibrillarin is one of the most important nucleolar proteins that have been shown  as essential for life. Fibrillarin localizes primarily at the periphery between  fibrillar center and dense fibrillar component as well as in Cajal bodies. In  most plants there are at least two different genes for fibrillarin. In  Arabidopsis thaliana both genes show high level of expression in  transcriptionally active cells. Here, we focus on two important differences  between A. thaliana fibrillarins. First and most relevant is the enzymatic  activity by AtFib2. The AtFib2 shows a novel ribonuclease activity that is not  seen with AtFib1. Second is a difference in the ability to interact with  phosphoinositides and phosphatidic acid between both proteins. We also show that  the novel ribonuclease activity as well as the phospholipid binding region of  fibrillarin is confine to the GAR domain. The ribonuclease activity of  fibrillarin reveals in this study represents a new role for this protein in rRNA  processing.', '2017', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2017.01878', 'Castano']
