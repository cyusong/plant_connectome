Plant cell wall composition and structure can be modified as plants adapt to environmental stresses; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that OsTMF, a homologue of the human TATA modulatory factor (TMF) in rice (Oryza sativa) and highly conserved in plants, negatively regulates cold tolerance through modification of cell wall properties. Cold stress increased the expression of OsTMF and accumulation of OsTMF in the nucleus, where OsTMF acts as a transcription activator and modulates the expression of genes involved in pectin degradation (OsBURP16), cellulose biosynthesis (OsCesA4 and OsCesA9), and cell wall structural maintenance (genes encoding proline-rich proteins and peroxidases). OsTMF directly activated the expression of OsBURP16, OsCesA4, and OsCesA9 through binding to the TATA cis-elements in their promoters. Under cold stress conditions, OsTMF negatively regulated pectin content and peroxidase activity and positively regulated cellulose content, causing corresponding alterations to cell wall properties, all of which collectively contribute to the negative effect of OsTMF on cold tolerance. Our findings unravel a previously unreported molecular mechanism of a conserved plant TMF protein in the regulation of cell wall changes under cold stress.
