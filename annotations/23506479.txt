The Arabidopsis trichome is a model system for studying cell development, cell differentiation and the cell cycle in plants. Our previous studies have shown that the ZINC FINGER PROTEIN5 (ZFP5) controls shoot maturation and epidermal cell fate through GA signaling in Arabidopsis. We have identified a novel C2H2 zinc finger protein ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 6 (ZFP6) which plays a key role in regulating trichome development in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of ZFP6 results in ectopic trichomes on carpels and other inflorescence organs. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses have shown that the zfp6 mutant exhibits a reduced number of trichomes in sepals of flowers, cauline leaves, lateral branch and main inflorescence stems in comparison to wild-type plants. Molecular and genetic analyses suggest that ZFP6 functions upstream of GIS, GIS2, ZFP8, ZFP5 and key trichome initiation regulators GL1 and GL3.We reveal that ZFP6 and ZFP5 mediate the regulation of trichome initiation by integrating GA and cytokinin signaling in Arabidopsis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of plant hormone control of epidermal trichome patterning through C2H2 transcriptional factors.
