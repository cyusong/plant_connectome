In phosphate (Pi)-deprived Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is substituted by sulfolipid for maintaining Pi homeostasis. Sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol1 (AtSQD1) encodes a protein, which catalyzes uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG) and sulfite (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> ) to UDP-sulfoquinovose, which is a key component in the sulfolipid biosynthetic pathway. In this study, a reverse genetics approach was employed to decipher the function of the AtSQD1 homolog OsSQD1 in rice. Differential expressions of OsSQD1 in different tissue and response to -P and -S also detected, respectively. The in vitro protein assay and analysis suggests that OsSQD1 is a UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase. Transient expression analysis showed that OsSQD1 is located in the chloroplast. The analyses of the knockout (ossqd1) and knockdown (Ri1 and Ri2) mutants demonstrated reductions in Pi and total P concentrations, <sup>32</sup> Pi uptake rate, expression levels of Pi transporters and altered developmental responses of root traits, which were accentuated during Pi deficiency. The inhibitory effects of the OsSQD1 mutation were also evident in the development of reproductive tissue. Furthermore, OsSQD1 differently affects lipid composition under different Pi regime affects sulfur (S) homeostasis. Together, the study revealed that OsSQD1 affects Pi and S homeostasis, and lipid composition in response to Pi deprivation.
