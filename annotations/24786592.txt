Compartmentation is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic cells and the basis for metabolic complexity. We recently reported on the protein compartmentation in the moss Physcomitrella patens. This study utilized a combination of quantitative proteomics, comparative genomics, and single protein tagging and provided data on the postendosymbiotic evolution of plastids and mitochondria, on organellar communication, as well as on inter- and intracellular heterogeneity of organelles. We highlight potential organelle interaction hubs with specific protein content such as plastid stromules, and report on the plasticity of protein targeting to organelles.
