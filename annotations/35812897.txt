The efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system remains limited in many crops. Utilizing strong promoters to boost the expression level of <i>Cas9</i> are commonly used to improve the editing efficiency. However, these strategies also increase the risk of off-target mutation. Here, we developed a new strategy to utilize intron-mediated enhancement (IME)-assisted <i>35S</i> promoter to drive <i>Cas9</i> and sgRNA in a single transcript, which escalates the editing efficiency by moderately enhancing the expression of both <i>Cas9</i> and sgRNA. In addition, we developed another strategy to enrich cells highly expressing <i>Cas9</i>/sgRNA by co-expressing the developmental regulator gene <i>GRF5</i>, which has been proved to ameliorate the transformation efficiency, and the transgenic plants from these cells also exhibited enhanced editing efficiency. This system elevated the genome editing efficiency from 14-28% to 54-81% on three targets tested in lettuce (<i>Lactuca sativa</i>) without increasing the off-target editing efficiency. Thus, we established a new genome editing system with highly improved on-target editing efficiency and without obvious increasement in off-target effects, which can be used to characterize genes of interest in lettuce and other crops.
