Plants are confronted with predictable daily biotic and abiotic stresses that result from the day-night cycle. The circadian clock provides an anticipation mechanism to respond to these daily stress signals to increase fitness. Jasmonate (JA) is a phytohormone that mediates various growth and stress responses. Here, we found that the circadian-clock component TIME FOR COFFEE (TIC) acts as a negative factor in the JA-signaling pathway. We showed that the tic mutant is hypersensitive to growth-repressive effects of JA and displays altered JA-regulated gene expression. TIC was found to interact with MYC2, a key transcription factor of JA signaling. From this, we discovered that the circadian clock rhythmically regulates JA signaling. TIC is a key determinant in this circadian-gated process, and as a result, the tic mutant is defective in rhythmic JA responses to pathogen infection. TIC acts here by inhibiting MYC2 protein accumulation and by controlling the transcriptional repression of CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 in an evening-phase-specific manner. Taken together, we propose that TIC acts as an output component of the circadian oscillator to influence JA signaling directly.
