Salt stress has been frequently studied in its first osmotic phase. Very often, data regarding the second ionic phase is missing. It has also been suggested that Putrescine or/and Spermine could be responsible for salt resistance. In order to test this hypothesis under long-term salt stress, we obtained Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic plants harboring pRD29A::oatADC or pRD29A::GUS construction. Although Putrescine was the only polyamine significantly increased after salt acclimation in pRD29A::oatADC transgenic lines, this rendered in no advantage to this kind of stress. The higher Spermine levels found in WT and transgenic lines when compared to control conditions along with no increment on Putrescine levels in WT plants under salt acclimation, leads us to analyze Spermine effect on pADC1 and pADC2 expression. Increasing levels of this polyamine inhibits these promoters expression while enhances pRD29A expression, making Spermine the polyamine responsible for salt acclimation, and the transgenic lines developed in this work suitable for studying Putrescine roles in conditions where its biosynthesis would be inhibited in the WT genotype.

Salt stress: !increases! Spermine 
Spermine: !inhibits! pADC1/pADC2 expression 
Spermine: !enhances! pRD29A expression 
Putrescine: !increases! in transgenic lines 
Putrescine: !no advantage to! salt stress
