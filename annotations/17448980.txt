As more plant genome sequences become available, researchers are increasingly using comparative genomics to address some of the major questions in plant biology. Such questions include the evolution of photosynthesis and multicellularity, the developmental genetic changes responsible for alterations in body plan, and the origin of important plant innovations such as roots, leaves, and vascular tissue.
