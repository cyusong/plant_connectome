['10536025', 'Flavonoids are secondary metabolites derived from phenylalanine and acetate  metabolism that perform a variety of essential functions in higher plants.  Studies over the past 30 years have supported a model in which flavonoid  metabolism is catalyzed by an enzyme complex localized to the endoplasmic  reticulum [Hrazdina, G. & Wagner, G. J. (1985) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 237,  88-100]. To test this model further we assayed for direct interactions between  several key flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes in developing Arabidopsis seedlings.  Two-hybrid assays indicated that chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase (CHI), and  dihydroflavonol 4-reductase interact in an orientation-dependent manner. Affinity  chromatography and immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated interactions  between chalcone synthase, CHI, and flavonol 3-hydroxylase in lysates from  Arabidopsis seedlings. These results support the hypothesis that the flavonoid  enzymes assemble as a macromolecular complex with contacts between multiple  proteins. Evidence was also found for posttranslational modification of CHI. The  importance of understanding the subcellular organization of elaborate enzyme  systems is discussed in the context of metabolic engineering.', '1999 Oct 26', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.96.22.12929', 'Winkel-Shirley']
