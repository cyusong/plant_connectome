Outlook 699 Acknowledgements 699 References 699 SUMMARY: Monkeyflowers (Mimulus) have long been recognized as a classic ecological and evolutionary model system. However, only recently has it been realized that this system also holds great promise for studying the developmental genetics and evo-devo of important plant traits that are not found in well-established model systems such as Arabidopsis. Here, I review recent progress in four different areas of plant research enabled by this new model, including transcriptional regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis, formation of periodic pigmentation patterns, developmental genetics of corolla tube formation and elaboration, and the molecular basis of floral trait divergence underlying pollinator shift. These examples suggest that Mimulus offers ample opportunities to make exciting discoveries in plant development and evolution.
