AtMYB31, a R2R3-MYB transcription factor that modulates wax biosynthesis in reproductive tissues, is involved in seed development in Arabidopsis. R2R3-MYB transcription factors play important roles in plant development; yet, the exact role of each of them remains to be resolved. Here we report that the Arabidopsis AtMYB31 is required for wax biosynthesis in epidermis of reproductive tissues, and is involved in seed development. AtMYB31 was ubiquitously expressed in both vegetative and reproductive tissues with higher expression levels in siliques and seeds, while AtMYB31 was localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm. Loss of function of AtMYB31 reduced wax accumulation in the epidermis of silique and flower tissues, disrupted seed coat epidermal wall development and mucilage production, altered seed proanthocyanidin and polyester content. AtMYB31 could direct activate expressions of several wax biosynthetic target genes. Altogether, AtMYB31, a R2R3-MYB transcription factor, regulates seed development in Arabidopsis.
