We have recently reported that ozone (O(3)) can inhibit mitochondrial respiration and induce activation of the alternative oxidase (AOX) pathway and in particular AOX1a in tobacco. While O(3) causes mitochondrial H(2)O(2), early leaf nitric oxide (NO) as well as transient ethylene (ET) accumulation, the levels of jasmonic acid and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid remained unchanged. It was shown that both, NO and ET dependent pathways can induce AOX1a transcription by O(3). AOX plays a role in reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) which in turn are linked to biotic and abiotic plant stresses, much like the second messengers guanosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP). The goal is to unravel specific cGMP signatures and induction pathways downstream from O(3) and NO, including transcription of AOX1a. Here we propose that some late (>3 h) responses to NO, e.g., the accumulation of phenylalanine lyase (PAL) transcripts, are critically cGMP dependent, while the early (<2 h) responses, including AOX1a induction are not.

O3: !inhibits! mitochondrial respiration 
O3: !induces! AOX1a 
NO: !induces! AOX1a 
ET: !induces! AOX1a 
AOX: !reduces! ROS 
cGMP: !linked to! biotic/abiotic plant stresses 
NO: !induces! PAL transcripts 
cGMP: !dependent on! late NO responses
