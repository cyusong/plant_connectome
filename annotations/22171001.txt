['22171001', 'Geminiviruses primarily encode only few factors, such as replication initiator  protein (Rep), and need various host cellular machineries for rolling-circle  replication (RCR) and/or recombination-dependent replication (RDR). We have  identified a host factor, RAD54, in a screen for Rep-interacting partners and  observed its role in DNA replication of the geminivirus mungbean yellow mosaic  India virus (MYMIV). We identified the interacting domains ScRAD54 and MYMIV-Rep  and observed that ScRAD54 enhanced MYMIV-Rep nicking, ATPase, and helicase  activities. An in vitro replication assay demonstrated that the geminiviral DNA  replication reaction depends on the viral Rep protein, viral origin of  replication sequences, and host cell-cycle proteins. Rad54-deficient yeast  nuclear extract did not support in vitro viral DNA replication, while exogenous  addition of the purified ScRAD54 protein enhanced replication. The role of RAD54  in in planta replication was confirmed by the transient replication assay; i.e.,  agroinoculation studies. RAD54 is a well-known recombination/repair protein that  uses its DNA-dependent ATPase activity in conjunction with several other host  factors. However, this study demonstrates for the first time that the eukaryotic  rolling-circle replicon depends on the RAD54 protein.', '2012 Mar', 'FASEB J', '10.1096/fj.11-188508', 'Mukherjee']
