Soil salinization is a major environmental problem that seriously threatens the sustainable development of regional ecosystems and local economies. <i>Fraxinus velutina</i> Torr. is an excellent salt-tolerant tree species, which is widely planted in the saline-alkaline soils in China. A growing body of evidence shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the defense response of plants to salt stress; however, how miRNAs in <i>F. velutina</i> exert anti-salt stress remains unclear. We previously identified two contrasting <i>F. velutina</i> cuttings clones, salt-tolerant (R7) and salt-sensitive (S4) and found that R7 exhibits higher salt tolerance than S4. To identify salt-responsive miRNAs and their target genes, the leaves and roots of R7 and S4 exposed to salt stress were subjected to miRNA and degradome sequencing analysis. The results showed that compared with S4, R7 showed 89 and 138 differentially expressed miRNAs in leaves and roots, respectively. Specifically, in R7 leaves, miR164d, miR171b/c, miR396a, and miR160g targeting <i>NAC1</i>, <i>SCL22</i>, <i>GRF1</i>, and <i>ARF18</i>, respectively, were involved in salt tolerance. In R7 roots, miR396a, miR156a/b, miR8175, miR319a/d, and miR393a targeting <i>TGA2.3</i>, <i>SBP14</i>, <i>GR-RBP</i>, <i>TCP2/4</i>, and <i>TIR1</i>, respectively, participated in salt stress responses. Taken together, the findings presented here revealed the key regulatory network of miRNAs in R7 responding to salt stress, thereby providing new insights into improving salt tolerance of <i>F. velutina</i> through miRNA manipulation.
