It has long been concerned that some secondary air pollutants such as smog components, ozone (O3) and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), are highly phytotoxic even at low concentrations. Compared with the biology of O3, we largely lack the information on the toxicity model for PAN at the cellular signaling levels. Here, we studied the cell-damaging impact of PAN using suspension culture of smog-sensitive tobacco variety (Bel-W3). The cells were exposed to freshly synthesized PAN and the induced cell death was assessed under microscope after staining with Evans blue. Involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PAN toxicity was suggested by PAN-dependently increased intracellular H2O2 and also by the cell-protective effects of ROS scavengers and related inhibitors. Calcium chelator also lowered the level of PAN-induced cell death, indicating that Ca2+ is also involved. Using a transgenic cell line expressing aequorin, an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration responsive to the pulse of PAN, but sensitive to Ca2+ channel blockers, was recorded, indicating that Ca2+ channels are activated by PAN or PAN-derived signals. Above data show some similarity between the signaling mechanisms responsive to O3 and PAN.
