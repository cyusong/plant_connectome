Axillary meristem development determines both plant architecture and crop yield; this critical process is regulated by the PROLIFERATING CELL FACTORS (TCP) family of transcription factors. Although TCP proteins bind primarily to promoter regions, some also target gene bodies for expression activation. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that TEN, a TCP from cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), controls the identity and mobility of tendrils. Through its C terminus, TEN binds at intragenic enhancers of target genes; its N-terminal domain functions as a non-canonical histone acetyltransferase (HAT) to preferentially act on lysine 56 and 122 of the histone H3 globular domain. This HAT activity is responsible for chromatin loosening and host-gene activation. The N termini of all tested CYCLOIDEA and TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1-like TCP proteins contain an intrinsically disordered region; despite their sequence divergence, they have conserved HAT activity. This study identifies a non-canonical class of HATs and provides a mechanism by which modification at the H3 globular domain is integrated with the transcription process.
