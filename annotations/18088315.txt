['18088315', "Translation of the transcription factor bZIP11 is repressed by sucrose in a  process that involves a highly conserved peptide encoded by the 5' leaders of  bZIP11 and other plant basic region leucine zipper (bZip) genes. It is likely  that a specific signaling pathway operating at physiological sucrose  concentrations controls metabolism via a feedback mechanism. In this paper bZIP11  target processes are identified using transiently increased nuclear bZIP11 levels  and genome-wide expression analysis. bZIP11 affects the expression of hundreds of  genes with proposed functions in biochemical pathways and signal transduction.  The expression levels of approximately 80% of the genes tested are not affected  by bZIP11 promoter-mediated overexpression of bZIP11. This suggests that <20% of  the identified genes appear to be physiologically relevant targets of bZIP11.  ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE1 and PROLINE DEHYDROGENASE2 are among the rapidly activated  bZIP11 targets, whose induction is independent of protein translation. Transient  expression experiments in Arabidopsis protoplasts show that the bZIP11-dependent  activation of the ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE1 gene is dependent on a G-box element  present in the promoter. Increased bZIP11 expression leads to decreased proline  and increased phenylalanine levels. A model is proposed in which sugar signals  control amino acid levels via the bZIP11 transcription factor.", '2008 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03385.x', 'Smeekens']
