['15120073', 'In plants, the mechanism by which RNA can induce de novo cytosine methylation of  homologous DNA is poorly understood. Cytosines in all sequence contexts become  modified in response to RNA signals. Recent work has implicated the de novo DNA  methyltransferases (DMTases), DRM1 and DRM2, in establishing RNA-directed  methylation of the constitutive nopaline synthase promoter, as well as the DMTase  MET1 and the putative histone deacetylase HDA6 in maintaining or enhancing CpG  methylation induced by RNA. Despite the identification of enzymes that catalyze  epigenetic modifications in response to RNA signals, it is unclear how RNA  targets DNA for methylation. A screen for mutants defective in RNA-directed DNA  methylation identified a novel putative chromatin-remodeling protein, DRD1. This  protein belongs to a previously undefined, plant-specific subfamily of  SWI2/SNF2-like proteins most similar to the RAD54/ATRX subfamily. In drd1  mutants, RNA-induced non-CpG methylation is almost eliminated at a target  promoter, resulting in reactivation, whereas methylation of centromeric and rDNA  repeats is unaffected. Thus, unlike the SNF2-like proteins DDM1/Lsh1 and ATRX,  which regulate methylation of repetitive sequences, DRD1 is not a global  regulator of cytosine methylation. DRD1 is the first SNF2-like protein implicated  in an RNA-guided, epigenetic modification of the genome.', '2004 May 4', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2004.04.037', 'Matzke']
