Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen that causes crown gall disease. This pathogen is capable of transferring the T-DNA from its Ti plasmid to the host cell and, then, integrating it into the host genome. To date, this genetic transformation ability has been harnessed as the dominant technology to produce genetically modified plants for both basic research and crop biotechnological applications. However, little is known about the interaction between Agrobacterium tumefaciens and host plants, especially the host responses to Agrobacterium infection and its associated factors. We employed RNA-seq to follow the time course of gene expression in Arabidopsis seedlings infected with either an avirulent or a virulent Agrobacterium strain. Gene Ontology analysis indicated many biological processes were involved in the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation process, including hormone signaling, defense response, cellular biosynthesis, and nucleic acid metabolism. RNAseq and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results indicated that expression of genes involved in host plant growth and development were repressed but those involved in defense response were induced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Further analysis of the responses of transgenic Arabidopsis lines constitutively expressing either the VirE2 or VirE3 protein suggested Vir proteins act to enhance plant defense responses in addition to their known roles facilitating T-DNA transformation.
