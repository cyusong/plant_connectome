We investigated transcriptome changes in Euphorbia esula (leafy spurge) seeds with a focus on the effect of constant and diurnal fluctuating temperature on dormancy and germination. Leafy spurge seeds do not germinate when incubated for 21 days at 20 degrees C constant temperatures, but nearly 30% germinate after 21 days under fluctuating temperatures 20:30 degrees C (16:8 h). Incubation at 20 degrees C for 21 days followed by 20:30 degrees C resulted in approximately 63% germination in about 10 days. A cDNA microarray representing approximately 22,000 unique sequences was used to profile transcriptome changes in the first day after transfer of seeds from constant to alternating temperature conditions. Functional classification based on MIPS and gene ontology revealed active metabolism including up-regulation of energy, protein synthesis, and signal transduction processes. Down-regulated processes included translation elongation, translation, and some biosynthetic processes. Subnetwork analysis identified genes involved in abscisic acid, sugar, and circadian clock signaling as key regulators of physiological activity in seeds soon after the transfer to alternating conditions.
