['16709200', 'Zinc ions are required to maintain the biological activity of numerous proteins.  However, when mislocalized or accumulated in excess, Zn(2+) ions are toxic  because of adventitious binding to proteins and displacement of other metal ions,  among them Fe(2+), from their binding sites. Heterologous expression of a  previously uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana metal tolerance protein, MTP3, in  the zrc1 cot1 mutant of budding yeast restores tolerance to, and cellular  accumulation of, zinc and cobalt. An MTP3-GFP fusion protein localizes to the  vacuolar membrane when expressed in Arabidopsis. Ectopic over-expression of MTP3  increases Zn accumulation in both roots and rosette leaves of A. thaliana, and  enhances Zn tolerance. Exposure of wild-type plants to high but non-toxic  concentrations of Zn or Co, or Fe deficiency, strongly induce MTP3 expression  specifically in epidermal and cortex cells of the root hair zone. Silencing of  MTP3 by RNA interference causes Zn hypersensitivity and enhances Zn accumulation  in above-ground organs of soil-grown plants and of seedlings exposed to excess Zn  or to Fe deficiency. Our data indicate that, in wild-type A. thaliana, the AtMTP3  protein contributes to basic cellular Zn tolerance and controls Zn partitioning,  particularly under conditions of high rates of Zn influx into the root symplasm.', '2006 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02746.x', 'Kramer']
