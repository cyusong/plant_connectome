Using the newly available genome for Eucalyptus grandis, we sought to determine the genome-wide traits that enable this host to form mutualistic interactions with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) Pisolithus sp. and to determine how future predicted concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ) will affect this relationship. We analyzed the physiological and transcriptomic responses of E. grandis during colonization by different Pisolithus sp. isolates under conditions of ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (650 ppm) CO2 to tease out the gene expression profiles associated with colonization status. We demonstrate that E. grandis varies in its susceptibility to colonization by different Pisolithus isolates in a manner that is not predictable by geographic origin or the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-based phylogeny of the fungal partner. Elevated concentrations of CO2 alter the receptivity of E. grandis to Pisolithus, a change that is correlated to a dramatic shift in the transcriptomic profile of the root. These data provide a starting point for understanding how future environmental change may alter the signaling between plants and their ECM partners and is a step towards determining the mechanism behind previously observed shifts in Eucalypt-associated fungal communities exposed to elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 .
