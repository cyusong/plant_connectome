Abiotic stresses such as salinity and low temperature have serious impact on peanut growth and yield. The present work investigated the function of a MYB-related transcription factor gene <i>AhMYB30</i> obtained from peanut under salt and low temperature stresses by transgenic methods. The results indicated that the overexpression of <i>AhMYB30</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> could enhance the resistance of transgenic plants to freezing and salt stresses. The expression of stress-response genes <i>RD29A</i> (<i>Response-to-Dehydration 29A</i>), <i>COR15A</i> (<i>Cold-Regulated 15A</i>), <i>KIN1</i> (<i>Kinesin 1</i>) and <i>ABI2</i> (<i>Abscisic acid Insensitive 2</i>) increased in transgenic plants compared with in wild-type. Subcellular localization and transcriptional autoactivation validation demonstrated that AhMYB30 has essential features of transcription factors. Therefore, AhMYB30 may increase salt and freezing stress tolerance as the transcription factor (TF) in <i>Arabidopsis</i> through both DREB/CBF and ABA-signaling pathways. Our results lay the theoretical foundation for exploring stress resistance mechanisms of peanut and offering novel genetic resources for molecular breeding.
