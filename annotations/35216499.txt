Salt stress is one of the most severe adverse environments in rice production; increasing salinization is seriously endangering rice production around the world. In this study, a rice backcross inbred line (BIL) population derived from the cross of 9311 and wild rice <i>Oryza longistaminata</i> was employed to identify the favorable genetic loci of <i>O. longistaminata</i> for salt tolerance. A total of 27 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to salt tolerance were identified in 140 rice BILs, and 17 QTLs formed seven QTL clusters on different chromosomes, of which 18 QTLs were derived from <i>O. longistaminata</i>, and a QTL for salt injury score (SIS), water content of seedlings (WCS) under salt treatment, and relative water content of seedlings (RWCS) was repeatedly detected and colocalized at the same site on chromosome 2, and a cytochrome P450 86B1 (MH02t0466900) was suggested as the potential candidate gene responsible for the salt tolerance based on sequence and expression analysis. These findings laid the foundation for further improving rice salt tolerance through molecular breeding in the future.
