Sieve elements of many angiosperms contain structural phloem proteins (P-proteins) that can interact to create large P-protein bodies. P-protein bodies can occlude sieve plates upon injury but the range of functional and physiological roles of P-proteins remains uncertain, in part because of challenges in labeling and visualization methods. Here, we show that a reciprocal oligosaccharide probe, OGA<sup>488</sup>, can be used in rapid and sensitive labeling of P-protein bodies in Arabidopsis, poplar, snap bean and cucumber in histological sections. OGA<sup>488</sup> labeling of knockouts of the two Arabidopsis P-protein-encoding genes, <i>AtSEOR1</i> and <i>AtSEOR2</i>, indicated that labeling is specific to AtSEOR2. That protein bodies were labeled and visible in <i>Atseor1</i> knockouts indicates that heterodimerization of AtSEOR1 and AtSEOR2 may not be necessary for P-protein body formation. Double labeling with a previously characterized stain for P-proteins, sulphorhodamine 101, confirmed P-protein labeling and also higher specificity of OGA<sup>488</sup> for P-proteins. OGA<sup>488</sup> is thus robust and easily used to label P-proteins in histological sections of multiple angiosperm species.
