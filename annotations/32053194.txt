['32053194', 'Hypoxic conditions often arise from waterlogging and flooding, affecting several  aspects of plant metabolism, including the uptake of nutrients. We identified a  member of the CALCINEURIN beta-LIKE INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE (CIPK) family in  Arabidopsis, CIPK25, which is induced in the root endodermis under low-oxygen  conditions. A cipk25 mutant exhibited higher sensitivity to anoxia in conditions  of potassium limitation, suggesting that this kinase is involved in the  regulation of potassium uptake. Interestingly, we found that CIPK25 interacts  with AKT1, the major inward rectifying potassium channel in Arabidopsis. Under  anoxic conditions, cipk25 mutant seedlings were unable to maintain potassium  concentrations at wild-type levels, suggesting that CIPK25 likely plays a role in  modulating potassium homeostasis under low-oxygen conditions. In addition, cipk25  and akt1 mutants share similar developmental defects under waterlogging, further  supporting an interplay between CIPK25 and AKT1.', '2020 May 9', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eraa004', 'Pucciariello']
