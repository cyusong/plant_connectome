The lipid-derived hormones jasmonates (JAs) play key functions in a wide range of physiological and developmental processes that regulate growth, secondary metabolism and defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. In this connection, biosynthesis, tissue-specific distribution, metabolism, perception, signaling of JAs have been the target of extensive studies. In recent years, the involvement of JAs signaling pathway in the regulation of growth and adaptive responses to environmental challenges has been further examined. However, JAs-mediated mechanisms underlying the transition from 'growth mode' to 'adaptive mode' remain ambiguous. Combined analysis of transgenic lines deficient in JAs signaling in conjunction with the data from JAs-treated plants revealed the function of these hormones in rewiring of central metabolism. The collective data illustrate JAs-mediated decrease in the levels of metabolites associated with active growth such as sucrose, raffinose, orotate, citrate, malate, and an increase in phosphorylated hexoses, responsible for the suppression of growth and photosynthesis, concurrent with the induction of protective metabolites, such as aromatic and branched-chain amino acids, and aspartate family of metabolites. This finding provides an insight into the function of JAs in shifting the central metabolism from the production of growth-promoting metabolites to protective compounds and expands our understanding of the role of JAs in resource allocation in response to environmental challenges.
