Cotton plant is one of the most important economic crops in the world which supplies natural fiber for textile industry. The crucial traits of cotton fiber quality are fiber length and strength, which are mostly determined by the fiber elongation stage. Annexins are assumed to be involved in regulating fiber elongation, but direct evidences remain elusive. Recently, we have investigated the activities of fiber-specific expressed annexins AnGb5/6 and their interacted proteins in cotton. AnGb5 and 6 can interact reciprocally to generate a protein macro-raft in cell membrane. This macro-raft is probably a stabilized scaffold for Actin1 organization. The actin assembling direction and density are correlated with AnGb6 gene expression and fiber expanding rate among three fiber length genotypes. These results suggest that annexins may act as the adaptor that linked fiber cell membrane to actin assembling. Due to the strong Ca (2+) and lipid binding ability of annexins, these results also indicate that annexins complex may function as an intermediate to receive Ca (2+) or lipid signals during fiber elongation.
