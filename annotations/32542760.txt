The Plumbaginaceae (non-core Caryophyllales) is a family well known for species adapted to a wide range of arid and saline habitats. Of its salt-tolerant species, at least 45 are in the genus Limonium; two in each of Aegialitis, Limoniastrum and Myriolimon, and one each in Psylliostachys, Armeria, Ceratostigma, Goniolimon and Plumbago. All the halophytic members of the family have salt glands and salt glands are also common in the closely related Tamaricaceae and Frankeniaceae. The halophytic species of the three families can secrete a range of ions (Na<sup>+</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> , Ca<sup>2+</sup> , Mg<sup>2+</sup> , Cl<sup>-</sup> , HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> , SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> ) and other elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn). Salt glands are, however, absent in salt-tolerant members of the sister family Polygonaceae. We describe the structure of the salt glands in the three families and consider whether glands might have arisen as a means to avoid the toxicity of Na<sup>+</sup> and/or Cl<sup>-</sup> or to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations with the leaves. We conclude that the establishment of lineages with salt glands took place after the split between the Polygonaceae and its sister group the Plumbaginaceae.
