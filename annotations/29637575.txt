Chickpea is one of the world's largest cultivated food legumes and is an excellent source of high-quality protein to the human diet. Plant growth and development are controlled by programmed expression of a suite of genes at the given time, stage, and tissue. Understanding how the underlying genome sequence translates into specific plant phenotypes at key developmental stages, information on gene expression patterns is crucial. Here, we present a comprehensive Cicer arietinum Gene Expression Atlas (CaGEA) across different plant developmental stages and organs covering the entire life cycle of chickpea. One of the widely used drought tolerant cultivars, ICC 4958 has been used to generate RNA-Seq data from 27 samples at 5 major developmental stages of the plant. A total of 816 million raw reads were generated and of these, 794 million filtered reads after quality control (QC) were subjected to downstream analysis. A total of 15,947 unique number of differentially expressed genes across different pairwise tissue combinations were identified. Significant differences in gene expression patterns contributing in the process of flowering, nodulation, and seed and root development were inferred in this study. Furthermore, differentially expressed candidate genes from "QTL-hotspot" region associated with drought stress response in chickpea were validated.
