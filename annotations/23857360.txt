Aux/IAA genes play a pivotal role in auxin transcriptional regulation. Their functions were mainly studied in Arabidopsis through analysis of gain-of-function mutants. In the tomato, the Solanaceae reference species, different studies on Sl-IAA down-regulated lines showed specific role for Sl-IAA genes. Our recent work revealed that the Sl-IAA 27 gene displays a distinct behavior compared with most Aux/IAA genes, being down-regulated by auxin. Interestingly, the silencing of Sl-IAA27 leads to altered chlorophyll accumulation in leaves, reduced fertilization, altered fruit development and altered root formation. Here we report that IAA27 could be a key auxin signaling gene involved in AM in tomato and also in Medicago model plant. Indeed both Sl-IAA27 and its closest homolog in Medicago truncatula, Mt-IAA27, are overexpressed in mycorrhized roots. These data are in line with the putative role of auxin in arbuscular mycorrhization.
