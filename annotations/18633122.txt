['18633122', 'Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) is a highly conserved protein  found in all eukaryotic kingdoms. This study demonstrates that plant eIF5A is  involved in the development of disease symptoms induced by a common necrotrophic  bacterial phytopathogen. Specifically, AteIF5A-2, one of the three eIF5A genes in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), is shown to regulate programmed cell death  caused by infection with virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (Pst  DC3000). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with constitutively suppressed AteIF5A-2  exhibited marked resistance to programmed cell death induced by virulent Pst  DC3000, and there was a corresponding reduction in pathogen growth and  development of disease symptoms in the plant tissue. Constitutive overexpression  of AteIF5A-2 circumvented the apparent posttranscriptional regulation of  AteIF5A-2 protein expression characteristic of wild-type plants but did not  increase susceptibility to virulent Pst DC3000 ingression. The transgenic plants  with constitutive AteIF5A-2 overexpression did, however, display phenotypes  consistent with precocious cell death. The results indicate that AteIF5A-2 is a  key element of the signal transduction pathway resulting in plant programmed cell  death.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.118869', 'Thompson']
