['24667841', 'Sad1/UNC84 (SUN) domain proteins are a highly conserved family of inner nuclear  membrane localised proteins in eukaryotes. One of their main functions is as key  components of nucleo-cytoskeletal bridging complexes, in which SUN proteins  associate with nucleoskeletal elements. In metazoans these are the lamins, which  form a supportive structural network termed the lamina. Plants lack sequence  homologs of lamins but have a similar nucleoplasmic structural network to support  the plant NE. Putative components of this plant lamina-like structure are Little  Nuclei (LINC) proteins, which bear structural resemblance to lamins and fulfil  similar functions. This work explores the associations between AtLINC1, AtSUN1  and AtSUN2. AtLINC1 is recruited to the NE by SUN proteins and is immobilised  therein. This recruitment and the immobile properties are likely due to  AtSUN1/2-AtLINC1 protein interactions occurring in planta. In addition, the SUN  N-terminus appears to play an important role in mediating these interactions. The  associations between AtLINC1 and plant SUN proteins are a first indicator of how  the nucleoskeleton may be anchored to the nuclear membrane in plants. Building on  the previous characterisation of Klarsicht/Anc1/Syne1 homology (KASH) like  proteins in plants, this study advances the identification and characterisation  of nucleo-cytoskeletal bridging complexes in plants.', '2014', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0093406', 'Graumann']
