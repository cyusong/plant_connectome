['22131051', "As a result of the endosymbiotic gene transfer, the majority of proteins of  mitochondria and chloroplasts are encoded in the nucleus and synthesized in the  cytosol as precursor proteins carrying N-terminal transport signals for the  're-import' into the respective target organelle. Most of these transport signals  are monospecific, although some of them have dual targeting properties, that is,  they are recognized both by mitochondria and by chloroplasts as target  organelles. We have identified alpha-MPP2, one of the two isoforms of the  substrate binding subunit of mitochondrial processing peptidase of Arabidopsis  thaliana, as a novel member of this class of nuclear-encoded organelle proteins.  As demonstrated by in organello transport experiments with isolated organelles  and by in vivo localization studies employing fluorescent chimeric reporter  proteins, the N-terminal region of the alpha-MPP2 precursor comprises transport  signals for the import into mitochondria as well as into chloroplasts. Both  signals are found within the N-terminal 79 residues of the precursor protein,  where they occupy partly separated and partly overlapping regions. Deletion  mapping combined with in organello and in vivo protein transport studies  demonstrate an unusual architecture of this transport signal, suggesting a  composition of three functionally separated domains.", '2012 Mar', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssr092', 'Klosgen']
