Chemical exchange often serves as the first step in plant-microbe interactions and exchanges of various signals, nutrients, and metabolites continue throughout the interaction. Here, we highlight the role of metabolite exchanges and metabolic crosstalk in the microbiome-root-shoot-environment nexus. Roots secret a diverse set of metabolites; this assortment of root exudates, including secondary metabolites such as benzoxazinoids, coumarins, flavonoids, indolic compounds, and terpenes, shapes the rhizosphere microbiome. In turn, the rhizosphere microbiome affects plant growth and defense. These inter-kingdom chemical interactions are based on a metabolic circular economy, a seemingly wasteless system in which rhizosphere members exchange (i.e. consume, reuse, and redesign) metabolites. This review also describes the recently discovered phenomenon "Systemically Induced Root Exudation of Metabolites" in which the rhizosphere microbiome governs plant metabolism by inducing systemic responses that shift the metabolic profiles of root exudates. Metabolic exchange in the rhizosphere is based on chemical gradients that form specific microhabitats for microbial colonization and we describe recently developed high-resolution methods to study chemical interactions in the rhizosphere. Finally, we propose an action plan to advance the metabolic circular economy in the rhizosphere for sustainable solutions to the cumulative degradation of soil health in agricultural lands.
