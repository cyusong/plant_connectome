In the last 20 years, severe wheat stem rust outbreaks have been recorded in Africa, Europe, and Central Asia. This previously well controlled disease, caused by the fungus <i>Puccinia graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i>, has reemerged as a major threat to wheat cultivation. The stem rust (<i>Sr</i>) resistance gene <i>Sr22</i> encodes a nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor which confers resistance to the highly virulent African stem rust isolate Ug99. Here, we show that the <i>Sr22</i> gene is conserved among grasses in the Triticeae and Poeae lineages. Triticeae species contain syntenic loci with single-copy orthologs of <i>Sr22</i> on chromosome 7, except <i>Hordeum vulgare</i>, which has experienced major expansions and rearrangements at the locus. We also describe 14 <i>Sr22</i> sequence variants obtained from both <i>Triticum boeoticum</i> and the domesticated form of this species, <i>T. monococcum</i>, which have been postulated to encode both functional and nonfunctional <i>Sr22</i> alleles. The nucleotide sequence analysis of these alleles identified historical sequence exchange resulting from recombination or gene conversion, including breakpoints within codons, which expanded the coding potential at these positions by introduction of nonsynonymous substitutions. Three <i>Sr22</i> alleles were transformed into wheat cultivar Fielder and two postulated resistant alleles from Schomburgk (hexaploid wheat introgressed with <i>T. boeoticum</i> segment carrying <i>Sr22</i>) and <i>T. monococcum</i> accession PI190945, respectively, conferred resistance to <i>P. graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> race TTKSK, thereby unequivocally confirming <i>Sr22</i> effectiveness against Ug99. The third allele from accession PI573523, previously believed to confer susceptibility, was confirmed as nonfunctional against Australian <i>P. graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> race 98-1,2,3,5,6.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).
