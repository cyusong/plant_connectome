Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression to control certain genetic programs, such as growth and development, phytohormone regulation, and environmental stresses. 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) is the key element involved in aroma biosynthesis pathway, and the application of micronutrients can increase the 2-AP levels. However, little is known about the micronutrient-induced TFs involved in 2-AP biosynthesis. Here, we identify a number of TF families in two fragrant rice varieties, "Meixiangzhan-2" (M) and "Xiangyaxiangzhan" (X), in response to Zinc (Zn) application through transcriptomic analysis. A total of ~678 TFs were identified and grouped into 26 TF families, each of which was found to be involved in numerous signaling pathways. The WRKY TF family was found to be the most abundant, followed by bHLH and MYB. Furthermore, members of the WRKY, bHLH, MYB, ERF, HSF, MADS-box, NFY, and AP2 TF families were significantly upregulated and may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of aroma biosynthesis. In brief, this study enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanism of 2-AP biosynthesis and highlights the key TFs potentially involved in the production of aroma in fragrant rice.
