The homeostasis of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ), a key regulator of basic biological processes, is a result of the cooperation between its generation and scavenging. However, the mechanistic basis of this balance is not fully understood. We previously proposed that the interaction between glycolate oxidase (GLO) and catalase (CAT) may serve as a molecular switch that modulates H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> levels in plants. In this study, we demonstrate that the GLO-CAT complex in plants exists in different states, which are dynamically interchangeable in response to various stimuli, typically salicylic acid (SA), at the whole-plant level. More crucially, changes in the state of the complex were found to be closely linked to peroxisomal H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> fluctuations, which were independent of the membrane-associated NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, evidence suggested that H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> channeling occurred even in vitro when GLO and CAT worked cooperatively. These results demonstrate that dynamic changes in H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> levels are physically created via photorespiratory metabolic channeling in plants, and that such H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> fluctuations may serve as signals that are mechanistically involved in the known functions of photorespiratory H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> . In addition, our study also revealed a new way for SA to communicate with H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> in plants.
