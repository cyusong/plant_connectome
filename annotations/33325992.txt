Manganese (Mn) is an essential element for plant growth and development, but transporters required for Mn uptake have only been identified in a few plant species. Here, we functionally characterized a member of the natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (Nramps) family, FeNramp5 in buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), which is known as a species well adapted to acidic soils. FeNramp5 was mainly expressed in the roots, and its expression was upregulated by the deficiency of Mn and Fe. Furthermore, spatial and tissue-specific expression analysis showed that FeNramp5 was expressed in all tissues of the basal root regions. FeNramp5-GFP protein was localized to the plasma membrane when transiently expressed in buckwheat leaf protoplast. FeNramp5 showed the transport activity for Mn2+ and Cd2+ but not for Fe2+ when expressed in yeast. Furthermore, the transport activity for Mn2+ was higher in yeast expressing FeNramp5 than in yeast expressing AtNramp1. FeNramp5 was also able to complement the phenotype of Arabidopsis atnramp1 mutant in terms of the growth and accumulation of Mn and Cd. The absolute expression level of AtNramp1 was comparable to that of FeNramp5 in the roots, but buckwheat accumulated higher Mn than Arabidopsis when grown under the same condition. Further analysis showed that at least motif B in FeNramp5 seems important for its high transport activity for Mn. These results indicate that FeNramp5 is a transporter for the uptake of Mn and Cd and its higher transport activity for Mn is probably associated with higher Mn accumulation in buckwheat.
