Cold stress is one of the main factors limiting growth and development in pepper. Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) are specific calcium sensors with non-canonical EF-hands to capture calcium signals, and interact with CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) in the regulation of various stresses. In this study, we isolated a cold-induced CIPK gene from pepper named CaCIPK13, which encodes a protein of 487 amino acids. In silico analyses indicated that CaCIPK13 is a typical CIPK family member with a conserved NAF motif, which consists of the amino acids asparagine, alanine, and phenylalanine. The CaCIPK13 protein was located in the nucleus and plasma membrane. Knock down of CaCIPK13 resulted in enhanced sensitivity to cold stress in pepper, with increased malondialdehyde content, H2O2 accumulation, and electrolyte leakage, while the catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activities and anthocyanin content were decreased. The transcript level of cold and anthocyanin-related genes was substantially decreased in CaCIPK13-silenced pepper leaves relative to the empty vector control. On the contrary, overexpression of CaCIPK13 in tomato improved cold tolerance via increasing anthocyanin content and activities of reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes. Furthermore, the interaction of CaCIPK13 with CaCBL1/6/7/8 was Ca2+-dependent. These results indicate that CaCIPK13 plays a positive role in cold tolerance mechanism via CBL-CIPK signalling.
