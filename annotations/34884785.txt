Drought is a major abiotic stress imposed by climate change that affects crop production and soil microbial functions. Plants respond to water deficits at the morphological, biochemical, and physiological levels, and invoke different adaptation mechanisms to tolerate drought stress. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can help to alleviate drought stress in plants through various strategies, including phytohormone production, the solubilization of mineral nutrients, and the production of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase and osmolytes. However, PGPB populations and functions are influenced by adverse soil factors, such as drought. Therefore, maintaining the viability and stability of PGPB applied to arid soils requires that the PGPB have to be protected by suitable coatings. The encapsulation of PGPB is one of the newest and most efficient techniques for protecting beneficial bacteria against unfavorable soil conditions. Coatings made from polysaccharides, such as sodium alginate, chitosan, starch, cellulose, and their derivatives, can absorb and retain substantial amounts of water in the interstitial sites of their structures, thereby promoting bacterial survival and better plant growth.
