['22184234', 'The activity of the dual-specificity receptor kinase, brassinosteroid insensitive  1 (BRI1), reflects the balance between phosphorylation-dependent activation and  several potential mechanisms for deactivation of the receptor. In the present  report, we elucidate a unique mechanism for deactivation that involves  autophosphorylation of serine-891 in the ATP-binding domain. Serine-891 was  identified previously as a potential site of autophosphorylation by mass  spectrometry, and sequence-specific antibodies and mutagenesis studies now  unambiguously establish phosphorylation of this residue. In vivo, phosphorylation  of serine-891 increased slowly with time following application of brassinolide  (BL) to Arabidopsis seedlings, whereas phosphorylation of threonine residues  increased rapidly and then remained constant. Transgenic plants expressing the  BRI1(S891A)-Flag-directed mutant have increased hypocotyl and petiole lengths,  relative to wild-type BRI1-Flag (both in the bri1-5 background), and accumulate  higher levels of the unphosphorylated form of the BES1 transcription factor in  response to exogenous BL. In contrast, plants expressing the phosphomimetic  S891D-directed mutant are severely dwarfed and do not accumulate unphosphorylated  BES1 in response to BL. Collectively, these results suggest that  autophosphorylation of serine-891 is one of the deactivation mechanisms that  inhibit BRI1 activity and BR signaling in vivo. Many arginine-aspartate (RD)-type  leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases have a phosphorylatable residue within  the ATP-binding domain, suggesting that this mechanism may play a broad role in  receptor kinase deactivation.', '2012 Jan 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1108321109', 'Huber']
