Wounding triggers de novo organogenesis, vascular reconnection and defense response but how wound stress evoke such a diverse array of physiological responses remains unknown. We previously identified AP2/ERF transcription factors, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 (WIND1) and its homologs, WIND2, WIND3 and WIND4, as key regulators of wound-induced cellular reprogramming in Arabidopsis. To understand how WIND transcription factors promote downstream events, we performed time-course transcriptome analyses after WIND1 induction. We observed a significant overlap between WIND1-induced genes and genes implicated in cellular reprogramming, vascular formation and pathogen response. We demonstrated that WIND transcription factors induce several reprogramming genes to promote callus formation at wound sites. We, in addition, showed that WIND transcription factors promote tracheary element formation, vascular reconnection and resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. These results indicate that WIND transcription factors function as key regulators of wound-induced responses by promoting dynamic transcriptional alterations. This study provides deeper mechanistic insights into how plants control multiple physiological responses after wounding.
