Flowering time is a finely tuned process in plants, in part controlled by the age-regulated microRNA156 (miR156), which functions by suppressing the transcripts of SQUAMOSA-PROMOTER BINDING LIKE (SPL) transcription factors. ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins are essential effectors of miRNA-mediated gene regulation. However, which AGO(s) mediate(s) the control of flowering time remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a role of AGO5 in controlling flowering time by modulating the expression of SPL transcription factors. We show that AGO5 interacts physically and functionally with miR156 and that ago5 mutants present an early flowering phenotype in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, in ago5 mutants, the repression of flowering caused by miR156 overexpression is largely reversed, whereas leaf morphology remains unaffected. Our results thus indicate a specific role for AGO5 in mediating miR156 activity in meristematic, but not vegetative, tissue. As such, our data suggest a spatiotemporal regulation of the miR156 aging pathway mediated through different AGO proteins in different tissues.
