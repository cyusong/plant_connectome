In a first step toward understanding the molecular basis of pineapple fruit development, a sequencing project was initiated to survey a range of expressed sequences from green unripe and yellow ripe fruit tissue. A highly abundant metallothionein transcript was identified during library construction, and was estimated to account for up to 50% of all EST library clones. Library clones with metallothionein subtracted were sequenced, and 408 unripe green and 1140 ripe yellow edited EST clone sequences were retrieved. Clone redundancy was high, with the combined 1548 clone sequences clustering into just 634 contigs comprising 191 consensus sequences and 443 singletons. Half of the EST clone sequences clustered within 13.5% and 9.3% of contigs from green unripe and yellow ripe libraries, respectively, indicating that a small subset of genes dominate the majority of the transcriptome. Furthermore, sequence cluster analysis, northern analysis, and functional classification revealed major differences between genes expressed in the unripe green and ripe yellow fruit tissues. Abundant genes identified from the green fruit include a fruit bromelain and a bromelain inhibitor. Abundant genes identified in the yellow fruit library include a MADS box gene, and several genes normally associated with protein synthesis, including homologues of ribosomal L10 and the translation factors SUI1 and eIF5A. Both the green unripe and yellow ripe libraries contained high proportions of clones associated with oxidative stress responses and the detoxification of free radicals.
