['25057814', 'In plants, each male meiotic product undergoes mitosis, and then one of the  resulting cells divides again, yielding a three-celled pollen grain comprised of  a vegetative cell and two sperm cells. Several genes have been found to act in  this process, and DUO1 (DUO POLLEN 1), a transcription factor, plays a key role  in sperm cell formation by activating expression of several germline genes. But  how DUO1 itself is activated and how sperm cell formation is initiated remain  unknown. To expand our understanding of sperm cell formation, we characterized an  ARID (AT-Rich Interacting Domain)-containing protein, ARID1, that is specifically  required for sperm cell formation in Arabidopsis. ARID1 localizes within nuclear  bodies that are transiently present in the generative cell from which sperm cells  arise, coincident with the timing of DUO1 activation. An arid1 mutant and  antisense arid1 plants had an increased incidence of pollen with only a single  sperm-like cell and exhibited reduced fertility as well as reduced expression of  DUO1. In vitro and in vivo evidence showed that ARID1 binds to the DUO1 promoter.  Lastly, we found that ARID1 physically associates with histone deacetylase 8 and  that histone acetylation, which in wild type is evident only in sperm, expanded  to the vegetative cell nucleus in the arid1 mutant. This study identifies a novel  component required for sperm cell formation in plants and uncovers a direct  positive regulatory role of ARID1 on DUO1 through association with histone  acetylation.', '2014 Jul', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1004421', 'McCormick']
