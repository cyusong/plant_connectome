Nitrogen fixation in nodules provides leguminous plants with an ability to grow in nitrogen-starved soil. Infection of the host plants by microsymbionts triggers various physiological and morphological changes during nodule formation. In Lotus japonicus, expression of early nodulin (ENOD) genes is triggered by perception of bacterial signal molecules, nodulation factors (Nod factors). We examined the expression patterns of ENOD40 genes during the nodule formation process. Two ENOD40 genes of L. japonicus were specifically expressed in the nodule formation process, but they showed different expression patterns upon infection. Each ENOD40 gene demonstrates an individual specificity and regulation with regard to rhizobial infection.
