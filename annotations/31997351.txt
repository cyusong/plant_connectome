Access to greater genomic resolution through new sequencing technologies is transforming the field of plant pathology. As scientists embrace these new methods, some overarching patterns and observations come into focus. Evolutionary genomic studies are used to determine not only the origins of pathogen lineages and geographic patterns of genetic diversity, but also to discern how natural selection structures genetic variation across the genome. With greater and greater resolution, we can now pinpoint the targets of selection on a large scale. At multiple levels, crypsis and convergent evolution are evident. Host jumps and shifts may be more pervasive than once believed, and hybridization and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) likely play important roles in the emergence of genetic novelty.
