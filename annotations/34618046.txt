['34618046', 'Plants exhibit remarkable developmental plasticity, enabling them to adapt to  adverse environmental conditions such as low nitrogen (N) in the soil.  Brassinosteroids (BRs) promote root foraging for nutrients under mild N  deficiency, but the crosstalk between the BR- and N-signaling pathways in the  regulation of root growth remains largely unknown. Here, we show that  CALMODULIN-LIKE-38 (CML38), a calmodulin-like protein, specifically interacts  with the PEP1 RECEPTOR 2 (PEPR2), and negatively regulates root elongation in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) in response to low nitrate (LN). CML38 and  PEPR2 are transcriptionally induced by treatments of exogenous nitrate and BR.  Compared with Col-0, the single mutants cml38 and pepr2 and the double mutant  cml38 pepr2 displayed enhanced primary root growth and produced more lateral  roots under LN. This is consistent with their higher nitrate absorption  abilities, and their stronger expression of nitrate assimilation genes.  Furthermore, CML38 and PEPR2 regulate common downstream genes related to BR  signaling, and they have positive roles in BR signaling. Low N facilitated BR  signal transmission in Col-0 and CML38- or PEPR2-overexpressing plants, but not  in the cml38 and pepr2 mutants. Taken together, our results illustrate a  mechanism by which CML38 interacts with PEPR2 to integrate LN and BR signals for  coordinating root development to prevent quick depletion of N resources in  Arabidopsis.', '2021 Nov 3', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiab323', 'ORCID:']
