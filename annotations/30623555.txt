['30623555', 'In Arabidopsis, the initiation and proliferation of stomatal lineage cells is  controlled by SPEECHLESS (SPCH). Phosphorylation of SPCH at the  post-translational level has been reported to regulate stomatal development. Here  we report that IDD16 acts as a negative regulator for stomatal initiation by  directly regulating SPCH transcription. In Arabidopsis, IDD16 overexpression  decreased abaxial stomatal density in a dose-dependent manner. Time course  analysis revealed that the initiation of stomatal precursor cells in the IDD16-OE  plants was severely inhibited. Consistent with these findings, the transcription  of SPCH was greatly repressed in the IDD16-OE plants. In contrast, IDD16-RNAi  transgenic line resulted in enhanced stomatal density, suggesting that IDD16 is  an intrinsic regulator of stomatal development. ChIP analysis indicated that  IDD16 could directly bind to the SPCH promoter. Furthermore, Arabidopsis plants  overexpressing IDD16 exhibited significantly increased drought tolerance and  higher integrated water use efficiency (WUE) due to reduction in leaf  transpiration. Collectively, our results established that IDD16 negatively  regulates stomatal initiation via trans-repression of SPCH, and thus provide a  practical tool for increasing plant WUE through the manipulation of IDD16  expression.', '2019 Jul', 'Plant Biotechnol J', '10.1111/pbi.13070', 'Hua']
