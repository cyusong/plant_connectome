<i>Micromonospora terminaliae</i> sp. nov., type strain TMS7<sup>T</sup>, is a gram-positive nonmotile aerobic actinobacterium that was recently isolated from a surface-sterilized stem of the medicinal plant <i>Terminalia mucronata</i>. This strain was described as a novel species in the <i>Micromonospora</i> genus. To elucidate the application potential of this species, its genome was completely sequenced, using the PacBio SMRT cell platform, and was compared with selected complete genome sequences of other <i>Micromonospora</i> species. Genomic analysis revealed that the genome of TMS7<sup>T</sup> consists of one circular DNA chromosome of 6,717,200 bp with a GC content of 73.35% and one plasmid of 24,912 bp with a GC content of 65.39%. The entire genome contains 6,311 predicted coding genes, 57 transfer RNAs, and nine ribosomal RNA genes. The genome contains a type III polyketide biosynthesis gene cluster, which encodes enzymes that catalyze the production of alkyl-<i>O</i>-dihydrogeranyl-methoxyhydroquinone. This information combined with the previous report that this strain can grow well on pH 10 medium with 4% NaCl (wt/vol) indicates that this strain may have potential biocontrol applications for economic plants cultivated on alkaline soil.
