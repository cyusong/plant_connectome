In angiosperm, asymmetric zygote division is critical for embryogenesis. The molecular mechanism underlying this process has gained a great attention recently. Some players involve in the control of both accurate position and correct orientation of zygote division plane have been found, which provide useful clues for the extensive investigations. It is getting clear that both internal and external factors are involved in this complex regulatory mechanism and the asymmetric zygote division seems with great impact in cell fate determination and embryo pattern formation.

Internal factors: !affect! Zygote division plane
External factors: !affect! Zygote division plane
Zygote division plane: !determines! Cell fate
Zygote division plane: !forms! Embryo pattern
