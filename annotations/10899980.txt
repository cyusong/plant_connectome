['10899980', 'The formation of the cell plate, a unique structure in dividing plant cells, is  pivotal for cytokinesis. A mutation in the Arabidopsis KORRIGAN (KOR) gene causes  the formation of aberrant cell plates, incomplete cell walls, and multinucleated  cells, leading to severely abnormal seedling morphology. The mutant, designed  kor1-2, was identified as a stronger allele than the previously identified  kor1-1, which appears to be defective only in cell elongation. KOR1 encodes an  endo-1,4-beta-d-glucanase with a transmembrane domain and two putative polarized  targeting signals in the cytosolic tail. When expressed in tobacco BY2 cells, a  KOR1-GFP (green fluorescence protein) fusion protein was localized to growing  cell plates. Substitution mutations in the polarized targeting motifs of KOR1  caused the fusion proteins to localize to the plasma membrane as well. Expression  of these mutant genes in kor1-2 plants complemented only the cell elongation  defect but not the cytokinesis defect, indicating that polarized targeting of  KOR1 to forming cell plates is essential for cytokinesis. Our results suggest  that KOR1 plays a critical role during cytokinesis.', '2000 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.7.1137', 'Chua']
