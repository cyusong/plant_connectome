['28495891', 'Chilling stress is a major factor limiting plant development and crop  productivity. Because the plant response to chilling is so complex, we are far  from understanding the genes important in the response to chilling. To identify  new genes important in chilling tolerance, we conducted a novel mutant screen,  combining a confirmed SALK T-DNA insertion collection with traditional forward  genetics. We screened a pool of more than 3700 confirmed homozygous SALK T-DNA  insertion lines for visible defects under prolonged growth at 5 degrees C. Of the  chilling-sensitive mutants we observed, mutations at one locus were characterized  in detail. This gene, At1g45231, encodes an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  trimethylguanosine synthase (TGS1), previously uncharacterized in the plant  kingdom. We confirmed that Arabidopsis TGS1 is a functional ortholog of other  trimethylguanosine synthases based both on its in vitro methyltransferase  activity and on its ability to rescue the cold-growth inhibition of a  Saccharomyces cerevisiae tgs1Delta mutant in vivo. While tgs1 mutant plants grew  normally at 22 degrees C, their vegetative and reproductive growth was severely  compromised under chilling conditions. When we transgenically expressed TGS1 in  the mutant plants, the chilling-sensitive phenotype was relieved, demonstrating  that TGS1 is required for chilling tolerance.', '2017 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.00340', 'ORCID:']
