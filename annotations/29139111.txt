Soil salinity is one of several major abiotic stresses that constrain maize productivity worldwide. An improved understanding of salt-tolerance mechanisms will thus enhance the breeding of salt-tolerant maize and boost productivity. Previous studies have indicated that the maintenance of leaf Na<sup>+</sup> concentration is essential for maize salt tolerance, and the difference in leaf Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion has previously been associated with variation in salt tolerance between maize varieties. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a maize salt-tolerance quantitative trait locus (QTL), Zea mays Na<sup>+</sup> Content1 (ZmNC1), which encodes an HKT-type transporter (designated as ZmHKT1). We show that a natural ZmHKT1 loss-of-function allele containing a retrotransposon insertion confers increased accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in leaves, and salt hypersensitivity. We next show that ZmHKT1 encodes a plasma membrane-localized Na<sup>+</sup> -selective transporter, and is preferentially expressed in root stele (including the parenchyma cells surrounding the xylem vessels). We also show that loss of ZmHKT1 function increases xylem sap Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and causes increased root-to-shoot Na<sup>+</sup> delivery, indicating that ZmHKT1 promotes leaf Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion and salt tolerance by withdrawing Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap. We conclude that ZmHKT1 is a major salt-tolerance QTL and identifies an important new gene target in breeding for improved maize salt tolerance.
