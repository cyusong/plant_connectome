Brassinosteroid (BR) signaling, plant innate immunity, and stomatal developments are three pathways that are initiated by receptor-like kinases. This commentary focuses on the latest findings in the role of BR signaling in plant immunity and stomatal development that provide some insight into the molecular mechanism of the BR signal pathway interacting with other receptor signaling pathways.

Receptor-like kinases: !initiate! BR signaling
BR signaling: !interacts with! other receptor signaling pathways
BR signaling: !regulates! plant innate immunity
BR signaling: !controls! stomatal development
