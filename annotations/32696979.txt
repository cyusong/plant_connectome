Floral flavonols play specific pivotal roles in pollinator attraction, pollen germination and fertility, in addition to other functions in vegetative organs. For many plants, the process of flavonol biosynthesis in late flower development stages and in mature flower tissues is poorly understood, in contrast to early flower development stages. It is thought that this process may be regulated independently of subgroup 7 R2R3 MYB (SG7 MYB) transcription factors. In this study, two FLS genes were shown to be expressed synchronously with the flower development-specific and tissue-specific biosynthesis of flavonols in Freesia hybrida. FhFLS1 contributed to flavonol biosynthesis in early flower buds, toruses and calyxes, and was regulated by four well-known SG7 MYB proteins, designated as FhMYBFs, with at least partial regulatory redundancy. FhFLS2 accounted for flavonols in late developed flowers and in the petals, stamens and pistils, and was targeted directly by non SG7 MYB protein FhMYB21L2. In parallel, AtMYB21 and AtMYB24 also activated AtFLS1, a gene highly expressed in Arabidopsis anthers and pollen, indicating the conserved regulatory roles of MYB21 against FLS genes in these two evolutionarily divergent angiosperm plants. Our results reveal a novel regulatory and synthetic mechanism underlying flavonol biosynthesis in floral organs and tissues which may be exploited to investigate supplementary roles of flavonols in flowers.
