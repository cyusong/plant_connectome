Tiller number (TN) is an important agronomic trait affecting gramineous crop yield. To understand the static and dynamic information of quantitative trait locus (QTLs) controlling TN of <i>Agropyron</i> Gaertn., both the unconditional and conditional quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of TN were conducted using a cross-pollinated (CP) hybrid population with a total of 113 plant lines from the cross between <i>Agropyron cristatum</i> (L.) Gaertn. Z1842 and <i>Allium mongolicum</i> Keng Z2098, based on the phenotypic data of TN at five developmental stages [i.e., recovering stage (RS), jointing stage (JS), heading stage (HS), flowering stage (FS), and maturity stage (MS)] in 4 years (i.e., 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021) and the genetic map constructed of 1,023 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Thirty-seven QTLs controlling TN were detected using two analysis methods in 4 years, which were distributed in six linkage groups. Each QTL explained 2.96-31.11% of the phenotypic variation, with a logarithum of odds (LOD) value of 2.51-13.95. Nine of these loci detected both unconditional and conditional QTLs. Twelve unconditional major QTLs and sixteen conditional major QTLs were detected. Three relatively major stable conditional QTLs, namely, <i>cQTN1-3</i>, <i>cQTN1-5</i>, and <i>cQTN4-1</i>, were expressed in 2020 and 2021. Meantime, two pairs of major QTLs <i>cQTN1-5</i> and <i>qTN1-4</i> and also <i>cQTN2-4</i> and <i>qTN2-3</i> were located at the same interval but in different years. Except for <i>qTN2-2</i> and <i>qTN3-5</i>/<i>cQTN3-5</i>, other thirty-four QTLs were first detected in this study. This study provides a better interpretation of genetic factors that selectively control tiller at different developmental stages and a reference for molecular marker-assisted selection in the related plant improvement.
