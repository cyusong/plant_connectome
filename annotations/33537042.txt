Red coloration contributes to fruit quality and is determined by anthocyanin content in peach (<i>Prunus persica</i>). Our previous study illustrated that anthocyanin accumulation is strongly regulated by light, and the effect of induction differs according to light quality. Here we showed that both ultraviolet-A (UVA) and ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation promoted anthocyanin biosynthesis in "Hujingmilu" peach fruit, and a combination of UVA and UVB had additional effects. The expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis and light signaling related genes, including transcription factor genes and light signaling elements, were induced following UV irradiation as early as 6 h post-treatment, earlier than apparent change in coloration which occurred at 72 h. To investigate the molecular mechanisms for UVA- and UVB-induced anthocyanin accumulation, the genes encoding ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), Cryptochrome (CRY), and UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) in peach were isolated and characterized through functional complementation in corresponding Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants. <i>PpHY5</i> and <i>PpCOP1.1</i> restored hypocotyl length and anthocyanin content in Arabidopsis mutants under white light; while <i>PpCRY1</i> and <i>PpUVR8.1</i> restored <i>AtHY5</i> expression in Arabidopsis mutants in response to UV irradiation. Arabidopsis <i>PpHY5/hy5</i> transgenic lines accumulated higher amounts of anthocyanin under UV supplementation (compared with weak white light only), especially when UVA and UVB were applied together. These data indicated that PpHY5, acting as AtHY5 counterpart, was a vital regulator in UVA and UVB signaling pathway. In peach, the expression of <i>PpHY5</i> was up-regulated by UVA and UVB, and PpHY5 positively regulated both its own transcription by interacting with an E-box in its own promoter, and the transcription of the downstream anthocyanin biosynthetic genes <i>chalcone synthase 1</i> (<i>PpCHS1</i>), <i>chalcone synthase 2</i> (<i>PpCHS2</i>), and <i>dihydroflavonol 4-reductase</i> (<i>PpDFR1</i>) as well as the transcription factor gene <i>PpMYB10.1</i>. In summary, functional evidence supports the role of PpHY5 in UVA and UVB light transduction pathway controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis. In peach this is via up-regulation of expression of genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes, as well as the transcription factor <i>PpMYB10.1</i> and <i>PpHY5</i> itself.
