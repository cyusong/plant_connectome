Plant transcriptome contains an enormous amount of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that do not code for proteins but take part in regulating gene expression. Since their discovery in the early 1990s, much research has been conducted to elucidate their function in the gene regulatory network and their involvement in plants' response to biotic/abiotic stresses. Typically, 20-30 nucleotide-long small ncRNAs are a potential target for plant molecular breeders because of their agricultural importance. This review summarizes the current understanding of three major classes of small ncRNAs: short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNA (miRNA), and transacting siRNAs (tasiRNAs). Furthermore, their biogenesis, mode of action, and how they have been utilized to improve crop productivity and disease resistance are discussed here.
