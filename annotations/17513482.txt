Our previous studies with the pgsA mutant of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (hereafter termed pgsA mutant), which is defective for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), revealed an important role for PG in the electron acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII), especially in the electron transport between plastoquinones Q(A) and Q(B). This study now shows that PG also plays an important role in the electron donor side of PSII, namely, the oxygen-evolving system. Analyses of purified PSII complexes indicated that PSII from PG-depleted pgsA mutant cells sustained only approximately 50% of the oxygen-evolving activity compared to wild-type cells. Dissociation of the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbV, and PsbU, which are required for stabilization of the manganese (Mn) cluster, followed by the release of a Mn atom, was observed in PSII of the PG-depleted mutant cells. The released PsbO rebound to PSII when PG was added back to the PG-depleted mutant cells, even when de novo protein synthesis was inhibited. Changes in photosynthetic activity of the PG-depleted pgsA mutant cells induced by heat treatment or dark incubation resembled those of DeltapsbO, DeltapsbV, and DeltapsbU mutant cells. These results suggest that PG plays an important role in binding extrinsic proteins required for sustaining a functional Mn cluster on the donor side of PSII.
