['27381418', 'Nucleotide sugar transport across Golgi membranes is essential for the luminal  biosynthesis of glycan structures. Here we identify GDP-fucose transporter 1  (GFT1), an Arabidopsis nucleotide sugar transporter that translocates  GDP-L-fucose into the Golgi lumen. Using proteo-liposome-based transport assays,  we show that GFT preferentially transports GDP-L-fucose over other nucleotide  sugars in vitro, while GFT1-silenced plants are almost devoid of L-fucose in cell  wall-derived xyloglucan and rhamnogalacturonan II. Furthermore, these lines  display reduced L-fucose content in N-glycan structures accompanied by severe  developmental growth defects. We conclude that GFT1 is the major nucleotide sugar  transporter for import of GDP-L-fucose into the Golgi and is required for proper  plant growth and development.', '2016 Jul 6', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms12119', 'Heazlewood']
