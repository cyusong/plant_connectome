['8660683', 'A cDNA clone was obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana that encodes a protein  containing 92 amino acid residues with high sequence identity (57%) to bovine  acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP). The coding sequence of this clone was expressed  in Escherichia coli and the gene product (10.4 kDa) was purified. The recombinant  A. thaliana ACBP (rAthACBP) was shown to bind acyl-CoA esters and protect  acyl-CoAs from degradation by microsomal acyl-hydrolases. Antibodies that were  raised to rAthACBP recognized the native Arabidopsis ACBP and also cross-reacted  with a number of other plant ACBPs, including rapeseed (Brassica napus) ACBP. The  pattern of expression and level of the gene product were examined in various  tissues of Arabidopsis and Brassica using Western blotting. A. thaliana tissues  contained between 3 and 143 micrograms AthACBP g(-1) FW depending on the tissue  (0.4 to 14 nmol g(-1) FW). Developing B. napus seeds underwent a 12-fold increase  in ACBP levels during seed maturation (20 to 250 micrograms ACBP g(-1) FW); the  highest concentration occurring near the peak of triacylglycerol accumulation (26  nmol g(-1) FW.', '1996 Jul 1', 'Arch Biochem Biophys', '10.1006/abbi.1996.0282', 'Ohlrogge']
