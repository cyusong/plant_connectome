Starch directly determines the grain yield and quality. The key enzymes participating in the process of starch synthesis have been cloned and characterized. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms of starch synthesis remain unclear. In this study, we identified a novel starch regulatory gene, <i>ZmCBM48-1</i>, which contained a carbohydrate-binding module 48 (CBM48) domain. <i>ZmCBM48-1</i> was highly expressed in the maize endosperm and was localized in the plastids. Compared with the wild type lines, the overexpression of <i>ZmCBM48-1</i> in rice altered the grain size and 1000-grain weight, increased the starch content, and decreased the soluble sugar content. Additionally, the transgenic rice seeds exhibited an alterant endosperm cell shape and starch structure. Meanwhile, the physicochemical characteristics (gelatinization properties) of starch were influenced in the transgenic lines of the endosperm compared with the wild type seeds. Furthermore, <i>ZmCBM48-1</i> played a positive regulatory role in the starch synthesis pathway by up-regulating several starch synthesis-related genes. Collectively, the results presented here suggest that <i>ZmCBM48-1</i> acts as a key regulatory factor in starch synthesis, and could be helpful for devising strategies for modulating starch production for a high yield and good quality in maize endosperm.
