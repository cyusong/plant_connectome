Both phytohormone signaling and epigenetic mechanisms have long been known to play crucial roles in plant development and plasticity in response to ambient stimuli. Indeed, diverse signaling pathways mediated by phytohormones and epigenetic processes integrate multiple upstream signals to regulate various plant traits. Emerging evidence indicates that phytohormones and epigenetic processes interact at multiple levels. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the interplay between phytohormones and epigenetic processes from the perspective of phytohormone biology. We also review chemical regulators used in epigenetic studies and propose strategies for developing novel regulators using multidisciplinary approaches.
