In this study, we focused on the plant-growth-promoting properties of two strains isolated from Codonopsis pilosula, and the effect of inoculation with different strain treatments on physiological and metabolite accumulation of C. pilosula. The strains RHBA19 and RHBA17 were isolated and identified as Geobacillu sp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens, respectively. The two strains produced indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, biofilm, and various exoenzymes. Based on the pot experiments, inoculation of RHBA19 (G group) and the two mixed bacteria (M group) significantly improved the growth, root development, and photosynthesis of C. pilosula. Compared with the no-inoculation group (CK), the total polysaccharide content of root in the G and M groups was dramatically enhanced by 59.27% and 96.07%, and the lobetyolin (root) improved by 58.4% and 66.0%, respectively. After inoculation with bacteria agents, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, POD, SOD) of C. pilosula increased differentially. Inoculation with two types of bacterial agents significantly increased the activities of sucrose synthase (SS) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) in root, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) in leaf of C. pilosula. In addition, the content of signaling molecules (NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in three types of tissue increased significantly. The magnitude of these results was higher with mixtures than with individual strains. These results imply that the two types of bacterial agents induce physiological metabolism changes to accumulate polysaccharides and lobetyolin by regulating stress resistance enzymes and signal molecules, especially NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
