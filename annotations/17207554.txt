A full-length cDNA, BcMF11, has been cloned from Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis Makino) using rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE) based on a pollen-specific cDNA fragment (DN237921). The BcMF11 cDNA has a total length of 828bp with poly (A) tail. Analysis of the sequence demonstrated that BcMF11 is a novel non-coding RNA which has no prominent open reading frame (ORF) or coding capacity. No significant similarities were observed between BcMF11 and previously published sequences in GenBank. Transcription analysis indicated that BcMF11 is a novel pollen-specific ncRNA and may be involved in the pollen development of Chinese cabbage.
