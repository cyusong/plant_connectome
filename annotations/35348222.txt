['35348222', 'Pollen longevity is critical for plant pollination and hybrid seed production,  but few studies have focused on pollen longevity. In this study, we identified an  Arabidopsis thaliana gene, Protein associated with lipid droplets (PALD), which  is strongly expressed in pollen and critical for the regulation of pollen  longevity. PALD was expressed specifically in mature pollen grains and the pollen  tube, and its expression was upregulated under dry conditions. PALD encoded a  lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein and its N terminus was critical for the LD  localization of PALD. The number of LDs and diameter were reduced in pollen  grains of the loss-of-function PALD mutants. The viability and germination of the  mature pollen grains of the pald mutants were comparable with those of the  wild-type, but after the pollen grains were stored under dry conditions, pollen  germination and male transmission of the mutant were compromised compared with  those of the wild-type. Our study suggests that PALD was required for the  maintenance of LD quality in mature pollen grains and regulation of pollen  longevity.', '2022 Jul', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.18123', 'ORCID:']
