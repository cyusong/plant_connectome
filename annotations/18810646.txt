In planta excision techniques have proven useful both for basic biology and applied biotechnology. In this report, we describe a simple site-specific recombination (SSR) strategy that simultaneously removes pre-defined DNA sequences from both sides of a transgenic "gene of interest," leaving only the desired gene and short sequences from the recombinase recognition site. We have used the FLP/FRT SSR system to provide a proof of concept, though any of several other SSR systems could be used in the same way. The frequency of double excision ranged from 33% to 83% in different transgenic lines. We show that a single SSR reaction can simultaneously carry out double excisions and resolve complex transgene loci at high frequency. The method has direct biotechnological application and provides a useful tool for basic research.

FLP/FRT SSR system: !simultaneously removes! pre-defined DNA sequences 
SSR reaction: !carries out! double excisions 
SSR reaction: !resolves! complex transgene loci 
SSR system: !has direct biotechnological application!
