['20856808', "The essential eukaryotic molecular chaperone Hsp90 operates with the help of  different co-chaperones, which regulate its ATPase activity and serve as adaptors  to recruit client proteins and other molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70, to the  Hsp90 complex. Several Hsp90 and Hsp70 co-chaperones contain the  tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which interacts with the highly conserved  EEVD motif at the C-terminal ends of Hsp90 and Hsp70. The acidic side chains in  EEVD interact with a subset of basic residues in the TPR binding pocket called a  'carboxylate clamp'. Since the carboxylate clamp residues are conserved in the  TPR domains of known Hsp90/Hsp70 co-chaperones, we carried out an in silico  search for TPR proteins in Arabidopsis and rice comprising of at least one  three-motif TPR domain with conserved amino acid residues required for  Hsp90/Hsp70 binding. This approach identified in Arabidopsis a total of 36  carboxylate clamp (CC)-TPR proteins, including 24 novel proteins, with potential  to interact with Hsp90/Hsp70. The newly identified CC-TPR proteins in Arabidopsis  and rice contain additional protein domains such as ankyrin, SET,  octicosapeptide/Phox/Bem1p (Phox/PB1), DnaJ-like, thioredoxin, FBD and F-box, and  protein kinase and U-box, indicating varied functions for these proteins. To  provide proof-of-concept of the newly identified CC-TPR proteins for interaction  with Hsp90, we demonstrated interaction of AtTPR1 and AtTPR2 with AtHsp90 in  yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull down assays. These findings indicate that the  in silico approach used here successfully identified in a genome-wide context  CC-TPR proteins with potential to interact with Hsp90/Hsp70, and further suggest  that the Hsp90/Hsp70 system relies on TPR co-chaperones more than it was  previously realized.", '2010 Sep 15', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0012761', 'Krishna']
