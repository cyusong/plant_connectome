The formation of adventitious roots (ARs) derived from hypocotyl is the most important morphological adaptation to waterlogging stress in Cucumis sativus (cucumber). Our previous study showed that cucumbers with the gene CsARN6.1, encoding an AAA ATPase domain-containing protein, were more tolerant to waterlogging through increased AR formation. However, the apparent function of CsARN6.1 remained unknown. Here, we showed that the CsARN6.1 signal was predominantly observed throughout the cambium of hypocotyls, where de novo AR primordia are formed upon waterlogging treatment. The silencing of CsARN6.1 expression by virus-induced gene silencing and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies adversely affects the formation of ARs under conditions of waterlogging. Waterlogging treatment significantly induced ethylene production, thus upregulating CsEIL3 expression, which encodes a putative transcription factor involved in ethylene signaling. Furthermore, yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility assay and transient expression analyses showed that CsEIL3 binds directly to the CsARN6.1 promoter to initiate its expression. CsARN6.1 was found to interact with CsPrx5, a waterlogging-responsive class-III peroxidase that enhanced H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production and increased AR formation. These data provide insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms of AAA ATPase domain-containing protein and uncover a molecular mechanism that links ethylene signaling with the formation of ARs triggered by waterlogging.
