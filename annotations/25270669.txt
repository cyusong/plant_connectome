During recent years, biotechnology derived production of flavours and fragrances have expanded rapidly. The world's most popular flavour vanillin is no exception. This review outlines the current state of biotechnology-based vanillin synthesis with the use of ferulic acid, eugenol and glucose as substrates and bacteria, fungi and yeasts as microbial production hosts. The elucidated de novo biosynthetic pathway of vanillin in the vanilla orchid and the possible applied uses of this new knowledge in the biotechnology derived and pod-based vanillin industries are also highlighted.
