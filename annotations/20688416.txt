Significant progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms used by plants to recognize pathogens and activate "immune" responses. A "first line" of defense can be triggered through recognition of conserved Pathogen or Microbe Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs), resulting in activation of basal (or non-host) plant defenses, referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Disease resistance responses can also subsequently be triggered via gene-for-gene type interactions between pathogen avirulence effector genes and plant disease resistance genes (Avr-R), giving rise to effector triggered immunity (ETI). The majority of the conceptual advances in understanding these systems have been made using model systems, such as Arabidopsis, tobacco, or tomato in combination with biotrophic pathogens that colonize living plant tissues. In contrast, how these disease resistance mechanisms interact with non-biotrophic (hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic) fungal pathogens that thrive on dying host tissue during successful infection, is less clear. Several lines of recent evidence have begun to suggest that these organisms may actually exploit components of plant immunity in order to infect, successfully colonize and reproduce within host tissues. One underlying mechanism for this strategy has been proposed, which has been referred to as effector triggered susceptibility (ETS). This review aims to highlight the complexity of interactions between plant recognition and defense activation towards non-biotrophic pathogens, with particular emphasis on three important fungal diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves.

PAMPs/MAMPs: !trigger! PTI
Avr-R: !interact with! Pathogen avirulence effector genes 
Pathogen avirulence effector genes: !trigger! ETI
Non-biotrophic pathogens: !exploit! Plant immunity
ETS: !underlies! Non-biotrophic pathogen infection
