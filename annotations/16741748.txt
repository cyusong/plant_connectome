In flowering plants, post-embryonic development is mediated by the activity of shoot and root apical meristems. Shoot architecture results from activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which initiates primordia, including leaves, internodes and axillary meristems, repetitively from its flanks. Axillary meristems can develop into secondary shoots or flowers. In Arabidopsis, two paralogous BEL1-like (BELL) homeobox genes, PENNYWISE (PNY) and POUND-FOOLISH (PNF), expressed in the SAM, encode DNA-binding proteins that are essential for specifying floral primordia and establishing early internode patterning events during inflorescence development. Biochemical studies show that PNY associates with the knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) proteins, SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) and BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP). PNY-BP heterodimers are essential for establishing early internode patterning events, while PNY-STM heterodimers are critical for SAM function. In this report, we examined the role of PNY, PNF and STM during development. First, we show that PNF interacts with STM and BP indicating that PNY and PNF are redundant functioning proteins. Inflorescence development, but not vegetative development, is sensitive to the dosage levels of PNY, PNF and STM. Characterization of stm-10, a weak allele in the Columbia ecotype, indicates that STM is also involved in floral specification and internode development. Our examination of the genetic requirements for PNY, PNF and STM demonstrates that these KNOX-BELL heterodimers control floral specification, internode patterning and the maintenance of boundaries between initiating floral primordia and the inflorescence meristem.
