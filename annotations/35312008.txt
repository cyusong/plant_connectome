The transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) plays critical roles in plant photomorphogenesis. Previous studies on HY5 have mainly focused on the seedling stage in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and its functions in other plant species have not been well characterized, particularly at adult stages of development. In this report, we investigated the functions of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) HY5 (SlHY5) from seedlings to adult plants with a focus on fruits. Genome-edited slhy5 mutants exhibited typical compromised photomorphogenesis in response to various light conditions. The slhy5 mutants showed reduced primary root length and secondary root number, which is associated with altered auxin signaling. SlHY5 promoted chlorophyll biosynthesis from seedling to adult stages. Notably, the promotive role of SlHY5 on chlorophyll accumulation was more pronounced on the illuminated side of green fruits than on their shaded side. Consistent with this light-dependent effect, we determined that SlHY5 protein is stabilized by light. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses in fruits revealed that SlHY5 has major functions in the regulation of metabolism, including the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids and steroidal glycoalkaloids. These data demonstrate that SlHY5 performs both shared and distinct functions in relation to its Arabidopsis counterpart. The manipulation of SlHY5 represents a powerful tool to influence the two vital agricultural traits of seedling fitness and fruit quality in tomato.
