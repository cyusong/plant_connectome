['29438089', 'The cellular functions of two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) one-helix  proteins, OHP1 and OHP2 (also named LIGHT-HARVESTING-LIKE2 [LIL2] and LIL6,  respectively, because they have sequence similarity to light-harvesting  chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins), remain unclear. Tagged null mutants of OHP1  and OHP2 (ohp1 and ohp2) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar  plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf chlorophyll  fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane proteins revealed that  ohp1 deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core protein function  and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core proteins; however, it did not  affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic ohp1 plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc  proteins developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 proteins in  transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed  protein complexes with both OHP2 and High Chlorophyll Fluorescence244 (HCF244).  We also found PSII core proteins D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other  plant-specific proteins associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting  that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted  directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important  roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.', '2018 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.01782', 'ORCID:']
