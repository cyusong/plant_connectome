Transcript profiling was used to look for genes that differ in expression between the SAH hydrolase deficient and hypomethylated hog1-1 mutant and the parental (HOG1) line. This analysis identified a subset of gene transcripts that were up-regulated in hog1-1 plants. The majority of these transcripts were from genes located in the pericentromeric heterochromatin. About a third of the genes are annotated as transposons or having transposon homology. Subsequent experiments using Northern blots, RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR confirmed the up-regulation of 19 of the genes and identified a set of molecular probes for genes that are up-regulated in the hog1-1 background. Six (of six genes tested) of the hog1-1 up-regulated genes are also up-regulated in the hypomethylated ddm1 mutant, three in the hypomethylated met1 mutant and three in the dcl3 mutant. The results suggest that the hypomethylation in the mutant lines may have a causal role in the up-regulation of these transcripts.
