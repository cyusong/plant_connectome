The ability of plants to produce nitric oxide (NO) is now well recognised. In plants, NO is involved in the control of organ development and in regulating some of their physiological functions. We have recently shown that pollen generates NO in a constitutive manner and have measured both intra- and extracellular production of this radical. Furthermore, we have shown that nitrite accumulates in the media surrounding the pollen and have suggested that the generation of these signaling molecules may be important for the normal interaction between the pollen grain and the stigma on which it alights. However, pollen grains inevitably come into contact with other tissues, including those of animals and it is likely that the NO produced will influence the behavior of the cells associated with these tissues. Such non-animal-derived, NO-mediated effects on mammalian cells may not be restricted to pollen and plant debris and fungal spore-derived NO may elicit similar effects.
