Glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) protect cells against damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and play key roles in regulating many biological processes. Here, five <i>GPXs</i> were identified in the <i>Ricinus communis</i> genome. Phylogenetic analysis displayed that the GPXs were categorized into five groups. Conserved domain and gene structure analyses showed that the GPXs from different plant species harbored four highly similar motifs and conserved exon-intron arrangement patterns, indicating that their structure and function may have been conserved during evolution. Several abiotic stresses and hormone-responsive <i>cis</i>-acting elements existed in the promoters of the <i>RcGPXs</i>. The expression profiles indicated that the <i>RcGPXs</i> varied substantially, and some <i>RcGPXs</i> were coordinately regulated under abiotic stresses. Overexpression of <i>RcGPX4</i> in Arabidopsis enhanced cold tolerance at seed germination but reduced freezing tolerance at seedlings. The expression of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling genes (<i>AtABI4</i> and <i>AtABI5</i>), ABA catabolism genes (<i>AtCYP707A1</i> and <i>AtCYP707A2</i>), gibberellin acid (GA) catabolism gene (<i>AtGA2ox7</i>), and cytokinin (CTK)-inducible gene (<i>AtARR6</i>) was regulated in the seeds of transgenic lines under cold stress. Overexpression of <i>RcGPX4</i> can disturb the hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) homeostasis through the modulation of some antioxidant enzymes and compounds involved in the GSH-ascorbate cycle in transgenic plants. Additionally, RcGPX4 depended on the MAPK3-ICE1-C-repeat-binding factor (CBF)-COR signal transduction pathway and ABA-dependent pathway to negatively regulate the freezing tolerance of transgenic plants. This study provides valuable information for understanding the potential function of <i>RcGPXs</i> in regulating the abiotic stress responses of castor beans.
