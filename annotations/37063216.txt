Changing climatic conditions are an increasing threat to cotton production worldwide. There is a need to develop multiple stress-tolerant cotton germplasms that can adapt to a wide range of environments. For this purpose, 30 cotton genotypes were evaluated for two years under drought (D), heat (H), and drought + heat stresses (DH) under field conditions. Results indicated that plant height, number of bolls, boll weight, seed cotton yield, fiber fineness, fiber strength, fiber length, K<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup>, relative water contents (RWC), chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, and total soluble proteins got reduced under D and H and were lowest under DH, whereas superoxidase dismutase (SOD), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Na<sup>+</sup>, GOT%, total phenolic contents, ascorbate, and flavonoids got increased for consecutive years. Correlation studies indicated that there was a positive correlation between most of the traits, but a negative correlation with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions. PCA and clustering analysis indicated that MNH-786, KAHKSHAN, CEMB-33, MS-71, FH-142, NIAB-820, CRS-2007, and FH-312 consistently performed better than other genotypes for most traits under stress conditions. Identified genotypes can be utilized in the future cotton breeding program to develop high-yielding, climate change-resilient cotton.
