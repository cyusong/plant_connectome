['36778688', 'The regulation of intracellular pyrophosphate (PPi) level is crucial for proper  morphogenesis across all taxonomic kingdoms. PPi is released as a byproduct from  ~200 metabolic reactions, then hydrolyzed by either membrane-bound (H(+)-PPase)  or soluble pyrophosphatases (PPases). In Arabidopsis, the loss of the vacuolar  H(+)-PPase/FUGU5, a key enzyme in PPi homeostasis, results in delayed growth and  a number of developmental defects, pointing to the importance of PPi homeostasis  in plant morphogenesis. The Arabidopsis genome encodes several PPases in addition  to FUGU5, such as PPsPase1/PECP2, VHP2;1 and VHP2;2, although their significance  regarding PPi homeostasis remains elusive. Here, to assess their contribution,  phenotypic analyses of cotyledon aspect ratio, palisade tissue cellular  phenotypes, adaxial side pavement cell complexity, stomatal distribution, and  etiolated seedling length were performed, provided that they were altered due to  excess PPi in a fugu5 mutant background. Overall, our analyses revealed that the  above five traits were unaffected in ppspase1/pecp2, vhp2;1 and vhp2;2  loss-of-function mutants, as well as in fugu5 mutant lines constitutively  overexpressing PPsPase1/PECP2. Furthermore, metabolomics revealed that  ppspase1/pecp2, vhp2;1 and vhp2;2 etiolated seedlings exhibited metabolic  profiles comparable to the wild type. Together, these results indicate that the  contribution of PPsPase1/PECP2, VHP2;1 and VHP2;2 to PPi levels is negligible in  comparison to FUGU5 in the early stages of seedling development.', '2023', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2023.1031426', 'Ferjani']
