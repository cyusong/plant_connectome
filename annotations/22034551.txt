['22034551', 'Peroxisome proliferation occurs through enlargement, elongation and division of  pre-existing peroxisomes. In the Arabidopsis apem mutant, apem3, peroxisomes are  dramatically enlarged and reduced in number, revealing a defect in peroxisome  proliferation. The APEM3 gene was found to encode peroxisomal membrane protein 38  (PMP38). To examine the relative role of PMP38 during proliferation, a double  mutant was constructed consisting of apem3 and the peroxisome division mutant,  apem1, in which a defect in dynamin-related protein 3A (DRP3A) results in  elongation of peroxisomes. In the double mutant, almost all peroxisomes were  predominantly enlarged but not elongated. DRP3A is still able to localize at the  peroxisomal membrane on enlarged peroxisomes in the apem3 mutants. PMP38 is  revealed to be capable of interacting with itself, but not with DRP3A. These  results indicate that PMP38 has a role at a different step that requires  APEM1/DRP3A. PMP38 is expressed in various tissues throughout the plant,  indicating that PMP38 may participate in multiple unidentified functions in these  tissues. PMP38 belongs to a mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) protein. However,  unlike Arabidopsis nucleotide carrier protein 1 (AtPNC1) and AtPNC2, two other  peroxisome-resident MCF proteins that function as adenine nucleotide  transporters, PMP38 has no ATP or ADP transport activity. In addition, unlike  AtPNC1 and AtPNC2 knock-down plants, apem3 mutants do not exhibit any gross  morphological abnormalities. These results demonstrate that APEM3/PMP38 plays a  role distinct from that of AtPNC1 and AtPNC2. We discuss possible mechanism of  enlargement of peroxisomes in the apem3 mutants.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcr147', 'Nishimura']
