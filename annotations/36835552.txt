Large vacuoles are a predominant cell organelle throughout the plant body. They maximally account for over 90% of cell volume and generate turgor pressure that acts as a driving force of cell growth, which is essential for plant development. The plant vacuole also acts as a reservoir for sequestering waste products and apoptotic enzymes, thereby enabling plants to rapidly respond to fluctuating environments. Vacuoles undergo dynamic transformation through repeated enlargement, fusion, fragmentation, invagination, and constriction, eventually resulting in the typical 3-dimensional complex structure in each cell type. Previous studies have indicated that such dynamic transformations of plant vacuoles are governed by the plant cytoskeletons, which consist of F-actin and microtubules. However, the molecular mechanism of cytoskeleton-mediated vacuolar modifications remains largely unclear. Here we first review the behavior of cytoskeletons and vacuoles during plant development and in response to environmental stresses, and then introduce candidates that potentially play pivotal roles in the vacuole-cytoskeleton nexus. Finally, we discuss factors hampering the advances in this research field and their possible solutions using the currently available cutting-edge technologies.

F-actin: !governs! Vacuole transformations
Microtubules: !governs! Vacuole transformations
Vacuoles: !undergo! Dynamic transformation
Cytoskeletons: !mediates! Vacuolar modifications
Candidates: !potentially play! Pivotal roles
