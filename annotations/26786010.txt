To elucidate the stimulation of leaf growth by atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2), we performed a kinematic analysis of the eighth leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana (accession C24) plants grown for 17-35 days after sowing in the presence or absence of 50 ppb NO2 (designated +NO2 plants and -NO2 plants, respectively). We found that the peak and mean values of the relative rates of leaf expansion, cell division and cell expansion were always greater in +NO2 plants than in -NO2 plants. No evidence for prolonged duration was obtained. Thus, NO2 treatment increased the rates of both cell proliferation and enlargement to increase leaf size. Furthermore, a fold-change analysis showed that cell proliferation and enlargement differentially regulated NO2-induced leaf expansion.
