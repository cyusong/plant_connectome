['22184231', 'Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) typically mediate RNA cleavage, but examples of  miRNA-mediated translational repression have also been reported. However, the  functional significance of this latter process is unknown. We identified SUO in a  screen for Arabidopsis mutations that increase the accumulation of the  miR156-regulated gene SPL3. suo has a loss-of-function phenotype characteristic  of plants with reduced Argonaute (AGO)1 activity. An analysis of RNA and protein  levels in suo mutants demonstrated that this phenotype is a consequence of a  defect in miRNA-mediated translational repression; the effect of suo on  vegetative phase change is attributable to a reduction in miR156/miR157 activity.  SUO encodes a large protein with N-terminal bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) and  transcription elongation factor S-II (TFS2N) domains and two C-terminal GW  (glycine and tryptophan) repeats. SUO is present in the nucleus, and colocalizes  with the processing-body component DCP1 in the cytoplasm. Our results reveal that  SOU is a component of the miRNA pathway in Arabidopsis and demonstrate that  translational repression is a functionally important aspect of miRNA activity in  plants.', '2012 Jan 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1114673109', 'Poethig']
