The dynamic responses of microtubules (MTs) to internal and external signals are modulated by a plethora of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). In higher plants, many plant-specific MAPs have emerged during evolution as advantageous to their sessile lifestyle. Some members of the IQ67 domain (IQD) protein family have been shown to be plant-specific MAPs. However, the mechanisms of interaction between IQD proteins and MTs remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that the domain of unknown function 4005 (DUF4005) of the Arabidopsis IQD family protein ABS6/AtIQD16 is a novel MT-binding domain. Cosedimentation assays showed that the DUF4005 domain binds directly to MTs in vitro. GFP-labeled DUF4005 also decorates all types of MT arrays tested in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that a conserved stretch of 15 amino acid residues within the DUF4005 domain, which shares sequence similarity with the C-terminal MT-binding domain of human MAP Kif18A, is required for the binding to MTs. Transgenic lines overexpressing the DUF4005 domain displayed a spectrum of developmental defects, including spiral growth and stunted growth at the organismal level. At the cellular level, DUF4005 overexpression caused defects in epidermal pavement cell and trichome morphogenesis, as well as abnormal anisotropic cell elongation in the hypocotyls of dark-grown seedlings. These data establish that the DUF4005 domain of ABS6/AtIQD16 is a new MT-binding domain, overexpression of which perturbs MT homeostasis in plants. Our findings provide new insights into the MT-binding mechanisms of plant IQD proteins.
