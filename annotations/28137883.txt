['28137883', 'Detection of pathogens by plants is mediated by intracellular nucleotide-binding  site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor proteins. NLR proteins are defined by  their stereotypical multidomain structure: an N-terminal Toll-interleukin  receptor (TIR) or coiled-coil (CC) domain, a central nucleotide-binding (NB)  domain, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR). The plant innate immune  system contains a limited NLR repertoire that functions to recognize all  potential pathogens. We isolated Response to the bacterial type III effector  protein HopBA1 (RBA1), a gene that encodes a TIR-only protein lacking all other  canonical NLR domains. RBA1 is sufficient to trigger cell death in response to  HopBA1. We generated a crystal structure for HopBA1 and found that it has  similarity to a class of proteins that includes esterases, the heme-binding  protein ChaN, and an uncharacterized domain of Pasteurella multocida toxin.  Self-association, coimmunoprecipitation with HopBA1, and function of RBA1 require  two previously identified TIR-TIR dimerization interfaces. Although previously  described as distinct in other TIR proteins, in RBA1 neither of these interfaces  is sufficient when the other is disrupted. These data suggest that  oligomerization of RBA1 is required for function. Our identification of RBA1  demonstrates that "truncated" NLRs can function as pathogen sensors, expanding  our understanding of both receptor architecture and the mechanism of activation  in the plant immune system.', '2017 Mar 7', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1620973114', 'Dangl']
