['23333976', 'Chloroplasts are responsible for biosynthesis of salicylic acid (SA) an important  signal molecule in plant immunity. EDS5 is a homolog of the MATE (multidrug and  toxic compound extrusion) family of transporters, and is essential for SA  biosynthesis. It has been speculated that EDS5 would be involved in the export of  SA from chloroplasts. However, the subcellular localization of EDS5 remains  largely uncharacterized. We demonstrate here that EDS5 is specifically localized  to the chloroplast envelope membrane in Arabidopsis. In addition, we found that  EDS5 is preferentially expressed in epidermal cells. These findings suggest that  EDS5 is responsible for transport of SA from chloroplasts to the cytoplasm in  epidermal cells.', '2013 Apr', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.23603', 'Shiina']
