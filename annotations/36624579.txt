Ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs) process deubiquitination in eukaryotic organisms and are widely involved in plant development and responses to environmental stress. However, their role in cell death and plant immunity remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a rice lesion mimic mutant (LMM) and cloned its causative gene, LMM22. Both dysfunction and overexpression of LMM22 gave rise to the hypersensitive response-like cell death, reactive oxygen species bursts, and activated defence responses. LMM22 encodes an active UBP that is localised to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and displays a constitutive expression pattern in rice. LMM22 interacts with SPOTTED LEAF 35 (SPL35), a coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation domain-containing protein that is known to participate in ubiquitination and the regulation of cell death and disease response in rice. Additional analyses suggest that LMM22 can positively regulate and stabilise the abundance of SPL35 protein likely through its deubiquitination activity. These data therefore improve our understanding of the function of UBP in rice innate immune responses by demonstrating that LMM22 functions as a critical regulator of SPL35 in cell death and disease resistance.
