Light-induced stomatal opening stimulates CO2 uptake and transpiration in plants. Weak blue light under strong red light effectively induces stomatal opening. Blue light-dependent stomatal opening initiates light perception by phototropins, and the signal is transmitted to a plasma membrane H+-ATPase in guard cells via BLUE LIGHT SIGNALING 1 (BLUS1) kinase. However, it is unclear how BLUS1 transmits the signal to H+-ATPase. Here, we characterized BLUS1 signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana, and showed that the BLUS1 C-terminus acts as an auto-inhibitory domain and that phototropin-mediated Ser-348 phosphorylation within the domain removes auto-inhibition. C-Terminal truncation and phospho-mimic Ser-348 mutation caused H+-ATPase activation in the dark, but did not elicit stomatal opening. Unexpectedly, the plants exhibited stomatal opening under strong red light and stomatal closure under weak blue light. A decrease in intercellular CO2 concentration via red light-driven photosynthesis together with H+-ATPase activation caused stomatal opening. Furthermore, phototropins caused H+-ATPase dephosphorylation in guard cells expressing constitutive signaling variants of BLUS1 in response to blue light, possibly for fine-tuning stomatal opening. Overall, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the blue light regulation of stomatal opening.
