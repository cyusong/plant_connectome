K<sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> are the major forms of potassium and nitrogen that are absorbed by the roots of most terrestrial plants. In this study, we observed that a close relationship between NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is mediated by NITRATE TRANSPORTER1.1 (NRT1.1). The <i>nrt1.1</i> knockout mutants showed disturbed K<sup>+</sup> uptake and root-to-shoot allocation, and were characterized by growth arrest under K<sup>+</sup>-limiting conditions. The K<sup>+</sup> uptake and root-to-shoot allocation of these mutants were partially recovered by expressing <i>NRT1.1</i> in the root epidermis-cortex and central vasculature using <i>SULFATE TRANSPORTER1;2</i> and <i>PHOSPHATE1</i> promoters, respectively. Two-way analysis of variance based on the K<sup>+</sup> contents in <i>nrt1.1-1</i>/<i>K</i> <sup><i>+</i></sup> <i>transporter1</i>, <i>nrt1.1-1</i>/<i>high-affinity K</i> <sup><i>+</i></sup> <i>transporter5-3</i>, <i>nrt1.1-1</i>/<i>K</i> <sup><i>+</i></sup> <i>uptake permease7</i>, and <i>nrt1.1-1</i>/<i>stelar K</i> <sup><i>+</i></sup> <i>outward rectifier-2</i> double mutants and the corresponding single mutants and wild-type plants revealed physiological interactions between NRT1.1 and K<sup>+</sup> channels/transporters located in the root epidermis-cortex and central vasculature. Further study revealed that these K<sup>+</sup> uptake-related interactions are dependent on an H<sup>+</sup>-consuming mechanism associated with the H<sup>+</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> symport mediated by NRT1.1. Collectively, these data indicate that patterns of NRT1.1 expression in the root epidermis-cortex and central vasculature are coordinated with K<sup>+</sup> channels/transporters to improve K<sup>+</sup> uptake and root-to-shoot allocation, respectively, which in turn ensures better growth under K<sup>+</sup>-limiting conditions.
