['25901085', 'Diphosphorylated inositol polyphosphates, also referred to as inositol  pyrophosphates, are important signaling molecules that regulate critical cellular  activities in many eukaryotic organisms, such as membrane trafficking, telomere  maintenance, ribosome biogenesis, and apoptosis. In mammals and fungi, two  distinct classes of inositol phosphate kinases mediate biosynthesis of inositol  pyrophosphates: Kcs1/IP6K- and Vip1/PPIP5K-like proteins. Here, we report that  PPIP5K homologs are widely distributed in plants and that Arabidopsis thaliana  VIH1 and VIH2 are functional PPIP5K enzymes. We show a specific induction of  inositol pyrophosphate InsP8 by jasmonate and demonstrate that steady state and  jasmonate-induced pools of InsP8 in Arabidopsis seedlings depend on VIH2. We  identify a role of VIH2 in regulating jasmonate perception and plant defenses  against herbivorous insects and necrotrophic fungi. In silico docking experiments  and radioligand binding-based reconstitution assays show high-affinity binding of  inositol pyrophosphates to the F-box protein COI1-JAZ jasmonate coreceptor  complex and suggest that coincidence detection of jasmonate and InsP8 by COI1-JAZ  is a critical component in jasmonate-regulated defenses.', '2015 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.135160', 'ORCID:']
