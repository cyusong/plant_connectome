The adaptive response of Egyptian barley land races to drought stress was analyzed using difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE). Physiological measurements and proteome alterations of accession number 15141, drought tolerant, and accession number 15163, drought sensitive, were compared. Differentially expressed proteins were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. Alterations in proteins related to the energy balance and chaperons were the most characteristic features to explain the differences between the drought-tolerant and the drought-sensitive accessions. Further alterations in the levels of proteins involved in metabolism, transcription and protein synthesis are also indicated.
