Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are one of the largest protein families, which consists of >400 members in most species. However, the molecular functions of many PPR proteins are still uncharacterized. Here, we isolated a maize mutant, defective kernel 40 (dek40). Positional cloning, and genetic and molecular analyses revealed that DEK40 encodes a new E+ subgroup PPR protein that is localized in the mitochondrion. DEK40 recognizes and directly binds to cox3, nad2, and nad5 transcripts and functions in their processing. In the dek40 mutant, abolishment of the C-to-U editing of cox3-314, nad2-26, and nad5-1916 leads to accumulated reactive oxygen species and promoted programmed cell death in endosperm cells due to the dysfunction of mitochondrial complexes I and IV. Furthermore, RNA sequencing analysis showed that gene expression in some pathways, such as glutathione metabolism and starch biosynthesis, was altered in the dek40 mutant compared with the wild-type control, which might be involved in abnormal development of the maize mutant kernels. Thus, our results provide solid evidence on the molecular mechanism underlying RNA editing by DEK40, and extend our understanding of PPR-E+ type protein in editing functions and kernel development in maize.
