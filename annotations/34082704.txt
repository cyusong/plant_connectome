As an important subfamily of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), fasciclin-like AGPs (FLAs) contribute to various aspects of growth, development and adaptation, yet their function remains largely elusive. Despite the diversity of FLAs, only two members, Arabidopsis FLA3 and rice MTR1, are reported to be involved in sexual reproduction. In this study, another Arabidopsis FLA-encoding gene, FLA14, was identified, and its role was investigated. Arabidopsis FLA14 was found to be a pollen grain-specific gene. Expression results from fusion with green fluorescent protein showed that FLA14 was localized along the cell membrane and in Hechtian strands. A loss-of-function mutant of FLA14 showed no discernible defects during male gametogenesis, but precocious pollen germination occurred inside the mature anthers under high moisture conditions. Overexpression of FLA14 caused 39.2% abnormal pollen grains with a shrunken and withered appearance, leading to largely reduced fertility with short mature siliques and lower seed set. Cytological and ultramicroscopic observation showed that ectopic expression of FLA14 caused disruption at the uninucleate stage, resulting in either collapsed pollen with absent intine or pollen of normal appearance but with a thickened intine. Taken together, our data suggest a role for FLA14 in pollen development and preventing premature pollen germination inside the anthers under high relative humidity in Arabidopsis.
