Microtubules play important roles in many physiological processes such as plant responses to drought stress. Abscisic acid (ABA) accumulates significantly in plants in response to drought conditions, which has been considered as a major response for plants to enhance drought tolerance. In this work, the focus was on the possible roles of microtubules in the induction of ABA biosynthesis in the roots of Zea mays when subjected to osmotic stress. The dynamic changes of microtubules in response to the stress were investigated by immunofluorescence staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and a pharmacological approach. Disruption and stabilization of microtubules both significantly stimulated ABA accumulation in maize root cells, although this stimulation was markedly lower than that caused by osmotic stress. Cells in which the microtubule stability had been changed did not respond further to osmotic stress in terms of ABA biosynthesis. However, treatment with both a microtubule de-stabilizer and a stabilizer enhanced the sensitivity of cells to osmotic stress in terms of ABA accumulation. It is suggested that both osmotic stress and changes in microtubule dynamics would trigger maize root cells to biosynthesize ABA, and interactions between osmotic stress and microtubule dynamics would have an effect on ABA accumulation in root cells, although the exact mechanism is not clear at present.
