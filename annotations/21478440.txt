['21478440', "Plants synthesize a myriad of isoprenoid products that are required both for  essential constitutive processes and for adaptive responses to the environment.  The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) catalyzes a key  regulatory step of the mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis and is  modulated by many endogenous and external stimuli. In spite of that, no protein  factor interacting with and regulating plant HMGR in vivo has been described so  far. Here, we report the identification of two B'' regulatory subunits of protein  phosphatase 2A (PP2A), designated B''alpha and B''beta, that interact with HMGR1S and  HMGR1L, the major isoforms of Arabidopsis thaliana HMGR. B''alpha and B''beta are Ca(2)(+)  binding proteins of the EF-hand type. We show that HMGR transcript, protein, and  activity levels are modulated by PP2A in Arabidopsis. When seedlings are  transferred to salt-containing medium, B''alpha and PP2A mediate the decrease and  subsequent increase of HMGR activity, which results from a steady rise of  HMGR1-encoding transcript levels and an initial sharper reduction of HMGR protein  level. In unchallenged plants, PP2A is a posttranslational negative regulator of  HMGR activity with the participation of B''beta. Our data indicate that PP2A exerts  multilevel control on HMGR through the five-member B'' protein family during  normal development and in response to a variety of stress conditions.", '2011 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.074278', 'Campos']
