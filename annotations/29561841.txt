Plant development is affected by the integration of light and phytohormones, including jasmonates (JAs). To address the molecular mechanisms of possible interactions between blue light and JA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana, we used molecular and transgenic approaches to understand the regulatory relationships between FAR-RED INSENSITIVE 219 (FIN219)/JASMONATE RESISTANT1 (JAR1) and the blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome1 (CRY1). FIN219 overexpression in the wild type resulted in a short-hypocotyl phenotype under blue light. However, FIN219 overexpression in cry1, cry2 and cry1cry2 double mutant backgrounds resulted in phenotypes similar to their respective mutant backgrounds, which suggests that FIN219 function may require blue light photoreceptors. Intriguingly, FIN219 overexpression in transgenic plants harboring ectopic expression of the C terminus of CRY1 (GUS-CCT1), which exhibits a hypersensitive short-hypocotyl phenotype in all light conditions including darkness, led to a rescued phenotype under all light conditions except red light. Further expression studies showed mutual suppression between FIN219 and CRY1 under blue light. Strikingly, FIN219 overexpression in GUS-CCT1 transgenic lines (FIN219-OE/GUS-CCT1) abolished GUS-CCT1 fusion protein under blue light, whereas GUS-CCT1 fusion protein was stable in the fin219-2 mutant background (fin219-2/GUS-CCT1). Moreover, FIN219 strongly interacted with COP1 under blue light, and methyl JA (MeJA) treatment enhanced the interaction between FIN219 and GUS-CCT1 under blue light. Furthermore, FIN219 level affected GUS-CCT1 seedling responses such as anthocyanin accumulation and bacterial resistance under various light conditions and MeJA treatment. Thus, FIN219/JAR1 and CRY1 antagonize each other to modulate photomorphogenic development of seedlings and stress responses in Arabidopsis.
