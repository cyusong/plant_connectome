Root-knot nematode (RKN) is a major factor that limits the growth and productivity of important <i>Cucumis</i> crops, such as cucumber and melon, which lack RKN-resistance genes in their genome. <i>Cucumis metuliferus</i> is a wild <i>Cucumis</i> species that displays a high degree of RKN-resistance. WRKY transcription factors were involved in plant response to biotic stresses. However, little is known on the function of WRKY genes in response to RKN infection in <i>Cucumis</i> crops. In this study, <i>Cucumis metuliferus</i> 60 WRKY genes (<i>CmWRKY</i>) were identified in the <i>C. metuliferus</i> genome, and their conserved domains were classified into three main groups based on multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. Synteny analysis indicated that the WRKY genes were highly conserved in <i>Cucumis</i> crops. Transcriptome data from of <i>C. metuliferus</i> roots inoculated with RKN revealed that 16 <i>CmWRKY</i> genes showed differential expression, of which 13 genes were upregulated and three genes were downregulated, indicating that these <i>CmWRKY</i> genes are important to <i>C. metuliferus</i> response to RKN infection. Two differentially expression <i>CmWRKY</i> genes (<i>CmWRKY10</i> and <i>CmWRKY28</i>) were selected for further functional analysis. Both <i>CmWRKY</i> genes were localized in nucleus, indicating they may play roles in transcriptional regulation. This study provides a foundation for further research on the function of <i>CmWRKY</i> genes in RKN stress resistance and elucidation of the regulatory mechanism.
