Nickel speciation was studied in the xylem sap of Alyssum serpyllifolium ssp. lusitanicum, a Ni-hyperaccumulator endemic to the serpentine soils of northeast Portugal. The xylem sap was collected from plants growing in its native habitat and characterized in terms of carboxylic and amino acids content. The speciation of nickel was studied in model and real solutions of xylem sap by voltammetric titrations using Square Wave Voltammetry (SWV). The results showed that Ni transport in the xylem sap occurs mainly as a free hydrated cation (about 70%) and complexed with carboxylic acids, mainly citric acid (18%). Altogether, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid and aspartic acid complexed less than 13% of total Ni. A negligible amount bounded to the amino acids, like glutamic acid and glutamine (<1%). Histidine did not play a role in Ni translocation in the xylem sap of A. serpyllifolium under field conditions. Amino acids are one of the main forms of N transport in the xylem sap, and under field conditions, N is usually a limited nutrient. We hypothesize that the translocation of Ni in the xylem sap as a free ion or chelated with carboxylic acids is 'cheaper' in terms of N resources.
