['24750137', 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play key roles in plant immune  signalling, and elucidating their regulatory functions requires the  identification of the pathway-specific substrates. We used yeast two-hybrid  interaction screens, in vitro kinase assays and mass spectrometry-based  phosphosite mapping to study a family of MAPK substrates. Site-directed  mutagenesis and promoter-reporter fusion studies were performed to evaluate the  impact of substrate phosphorylation on downstream signalling. A subset of the  Arabidopsis thaliana VQ-motif-containing proteins (VQPs) were phosphorylated by  the MAPKs MPK3 and MPK6, and renamed MPK3/6-targeted VQPs (MVQs). When plant  protoplasts (expressing these MVQs) were treated with the flagellin-derived  peptide flg22, several MVQs were destabilized in vivo. The MVQs interact with  specific WRKY transcription factors. Detailed analysis of a representative member  of the MVQ subset, MVQ1, indicated a negative role in WRKY-mediated defence gene  expression - with mutation of the VQ-motif abrogating WRKY binding and causing  mis-regulation of defence gene expression. We postulate the existence of a  variety of WRKY-VQP-containing transcriptional regulatory protein complexes that  depend on spatio-temporal VQP and WRKY expression patterns. Defence gene  transcription can be modulated by changing the composition of these complexes -  in part - through MAPK-mediated VQP degradation.', '2014 Jul', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.12817', 'Lee']
