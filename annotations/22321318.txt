Because the comprehensive effects on metabolism by genetic manipulation of leaf Rubisco content are unknown, metabolome analysis was carried out on transgenic rice plants with increased or decreased Rubisco content using the capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) technique. In RBCS-sense plants, an increase in Rubisco content did not improve light-saturated photosynthesis. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and sedoheputulose 7-phosphate levels increased, but ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), ATP and ADP levels were not affected. It is considered from these results that RuBP regeneration independent of ATP supply became a bottleneck for photosynthesis. In RBCS-antisense plants, a decline in Rubisco content decreased photosynthesis with a substantial accumulation of RuBP. ATP and ADP levels also increased and were associated with increases in the diphosphate and triphosphate compounds of other nucleosides. These results imply that a decline in Rubisco content slowed down the Calvin cycle and that the resultant excess energy of ATP was transferred to other nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates. The levels of amino acids tended to decline in RBCS-sense plants and increase in RBCS-antisense plants, probably reflecting the demand for Rubisco synthesis. Starch and carbohydrate levels decreased only in RBCS-antisense plants. Thus, genetic manipulation of Rubisco contents widely affected C and N metabolism in rice.
