Rice eating and cooking quality (ECQ) is a major concern of breeders and consumers, determining market competitiveness worldwide. Rice grain protein content (GPC) is negatively related to ECQ, making it possible to improve ECQ by manipulating GPC. However, GPC is genetically complex and sensitive to environmental conditions; therefore, little progress has been made in traditional breeding for ECQ. Here, we report that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of genes encoding the grain storage protein glutelin rapidly produced lines with downregulated GPC and improved ECQ. Our finding provides a new strategy for improving rice ECQ.

CRISPR/Cas9: !knocks out! genes
genes: !encodes! glutelin
glutelin: !downregulates! GPC
GPC: !negatively affects! ECQ
ECQ: !improved by! manipulating GPC
