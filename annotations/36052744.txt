Herbivory severely affects plant growth, posing a threat to crop production. Calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ) signaling and accumulation of jasmonates (JAs) are activated in plant response to herbivore attack, leading to the expression of defense pathways. However, little is known about how the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal modulates JA biosynthesis. We used diverse techniques, including CRISPR/Cas9, UPLC-MS/MS and molecular biology methods to explore the role of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 16 in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal-triggered JA burst during herbivore defense in tomato. Here we show that simulated herbivory induces GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR LIKE3.3/3.5 (GLR3.3/3.5)-dependent increases in electrical activity, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and increases the abundance of CALMODULIN2 (CaM2) and ERF16 transcripts in tomato. The interaction between CaM2 and ERF16 promotes JA biosynthesis by enhancing the transcriptional activity of ERF16, which increases the activation of ERF16 expression and causes expression of LIPOXYGENASE D (LOXD), AOC and 12-OXO-PHYTODIENOIC ACID REDUCTASE 3 (OPR3), the key genes in JA biosynthesis. Mutation of CaM2 results in decreased JA accumulation, together with the expression of JA biosynthesis-related genes, leading to reduced resistance to the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera. These findings reveal a molecular mechanism underpinning the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal-initiated systemic JA burst and emphasize the pivotal role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal/ERF16 crosstalk in herbivore defense.
