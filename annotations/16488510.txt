The effects of oxygen supply within the range 20.8-50% (using pure oxygen and air), on cell cultures of Panax ginseng were investigated in a balloon-type bubble bioreactor (5L capacity, containing 4 L Murashige and Skoog medium, supplemented with 7.0 mgL(-1) indolebutyric acid, 0.5 mgL(-1) kinetin and 30 gL(-1) sucrose). A 40% oxygen supply was found to be optimal for the production of both cell mass and saponin yielding values of 12.8 g(DW)L(-1), 4.5mg(gDW)(-1) on day 25, respectively. Low (20.8%, 30%) and high (50%) oxygen concentration supplies were unfavorable to cell growth and saponin accumulation. The results indicate that oxygen supplementation to bioreactor-based ginseng cultures was beneficial for biomass accumulation and saponin production.
