Jasmonic acid and RAP2.6L are induced upon wounding but are not involved in cell proliferation during healing in Arabidopsis hypocotyls. Plants produce jasmonic acid in response to wounding, but its role in healing, if any, has not been determined. Previously, the jasmonic acid-induced transcription factor, RAP2.6L, related to APETALA 2.6-like, was identified as a spatially expressed factor involved in tissue reunion in partially incised flowering stems of Arabidopsis. In the present study, we investigated the function of JA and RAP2.6L on wound healing using an Arabidopsis hypocotyl-grafting system, in which separated tissues are reattached by vascular tissue cell proliferation. The jasmonic acid-responsive genes AOS and JAZ10 were transiently expressed immediately after grafting. We confirmed that the endogenous content of jasmonic acid-Ile, which is the bioactive form of jasmonic acid, increased in hypocotyls 1 h after grafting. Morphological analysis of the grafted tissue revealed that vascular tissue cell proliferation occurred in a similar manner in wild-type Arabidopsis, the jasmonic acid-deficient mutant aos, the jasmonic acid-insensitive mutant coi1, and in Arabidopsis that had been exogenously treated with jasmonic acid. RAP2.6L expression was also induced during graft healing. Because RAP2.6L expression occurred during graft healing in aos and coi1, its expression must be regulated via a jasmonic acid-independent pathway. The rap2.6L mutant and dominant repressor transformants for RAP2.6L showed normal cell proliferation during graft healing. Taken together, our results suggest that JA and RAP2.6L, induced by grafting, are not necessary for cell proliferation process in healing.

Jasmonic acid: !induces! RAP2.6L
Jasmonic acid: !increases! endogenous content 
RAP2.6L: !expressed! during graft healing 
RAP2.6L: !regulated! via jasmonic acid-independent pathway 
jasmonic acid: !not necessary! for cell proliferation process in healing
