Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) integrate elicitor perception with both early and late responses associated with plant defense and innate immunity. Much of the existing knowledge on the role of plant MAPKs in defense mechanisms against microbes stems from extensive research in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) MPK3 in response to flagellin peptide flg22, a well-known bacterial elicitor. Using differential proteomic analysis we show that TALEN-induced <i>MPK3</i> knock-out lines of barley (<i>HvMPK3</i> KO) exhibit constitutive downregulation of defense related proteins such as PR proteins belonging to thaumatin family and chitinases. Further analyses showed that the same protein families were less prone to flg22 elicitation in <i>HvMPK3</i> KO plants compared to wild types. These results were supported and validated by chitinase activity analyses and immunoblotting for HSP70. In addition, differential proteomes correlated with root hair phenotypes and suggested tolerance of <i>HvMPK3</i> KO lines to flg22. In conclusion, our study points to the specific role of HvMPK3 in molecular and root hair phenotypic responses of barley to flg22.
