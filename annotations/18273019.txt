['18273019', 'Cell-autonomous immunity is widespread in plant-fungus interactions and  terminates fungal pathogenesis either at the cell surface or after pathogen  entry. Although post-invasive resistance responses typically coincide with a  self-contained cell death of plant cells undergoing attack by parasites, these  cells survive pre-invasive defence. Mutational analysis in Arabidopsis identified  PEN1 syntaxin as one component of two pre-invasive resistance pathways against  ascomycete powdery mildew fungi. Here we show that plasma-membrane-resident PEN1  promiscuously forms SDS-resistant soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor  attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes together with the SNAP33 adaptor  and a subset of vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs). PEN1-dependent  disease resistance acts in vivo mainly through two functionally redundant VAMP72  subfamily members, VAMP721 and VAMP722. Unexpectedly, the same two VAMP proteins  also operate redundantly in a default secretory pathway, suggesting dual  functions in separate biological processes owing to evolutionary co-option of the  default pathway for plant immunity. The disease resistance function of the  secretory PEN1-SNAP33-VAMP721/722 complex and the pathogen-induced subcellular  dynamics of its components are mechanistically reminiscent of immunological  synapse formation in vertebrates, enabling execution of immune responses through  focal secretion.', '2008 Feb 14', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature06545', 'Schulze-Lefert']
