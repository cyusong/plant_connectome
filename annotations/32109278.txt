Seeds are the typical dispersal and propagation units of angiosperms and gymnosperms. Water movement into and out of seeds plays a crucial role from the point of fertilization through to imbibition and seed germination. A class of membrane intrinsic proteins called aquaporins (AQPs) assist with the movement of water and other solutes within seeds. These highly diverse and abundant proteins are associated with different processes in the development, longevity, imbibition, and germination of seed. However, there are many AQPs encoded in a plant's genome and it is not yet clear how, when, or which AQPs are involved in critical stages of seed biology. Here we review the literature to examine the evidence for AQP involvement in seeds and analyse Arabidopsis seed-related transcriptomic data to assess which AQPs are likely to be important in seed water relations and explore additional roles for AQPs in seed biology.
