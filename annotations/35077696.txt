Minicircular organelle genomes exist in diverse species but have never been observed in plants - that is, until now. The mitochondrial genome of the holoparasite Rhopalocnemis phalloides comprises 21 minicircles, which are extremely heteroplasmic, providing an exceptional example of convergent organelle evolution across disparate lineages.
