['12006626', 'The molecular basis of microtubule nucleation is still not known in higher plant  cells. This process is better understood in yeast and animals cells. In the yeast  spindle pole body and the centrosome in animal cells, gamma-tubulin small  complexes and gamma-tubulin ring complexes, respectively, nucleate all  microtubules. In addition to gamma-tubulin, Spc98p or its homologues plays an  essential role. We report here the characterization of rice and Arabidopsis  homologues of SPC98. Spc98p colocalizes with gamma-tubulin at the nuclear surface  where microtubules are nucleated on isolated tobacco nuclei and in living cells.  AtSpc98p-GFP also localizes at the cell cortex. Spc98p is not associated with  gamma-tubulin along microtubules. These data suggest that multiple  microtubule-nucleating sites are active in plant cells. Microtubule nucleation  involving Spc98p-containing gamma-tubulin complexes could then be conserved among  all eukaryotes, despite differences in structure and spatial distribution of  microtubule organizing centers.', '2002 Jun 1', 'J Cell Sci', '10.1242/jcs.115.11.2423', 'Schmit']
