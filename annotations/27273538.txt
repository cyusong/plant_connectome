['27273538', 'Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major constituent of the outer membrane of  Gram-negative bacteria and acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that  triggers immune responses in both plants and animals. LPS-binding protein (LBP)  and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), which bind to LPS and  play important roles in immunity of mammals, have been well studied. However, the  molecule contributing to LPS binding in plants is mostly unknown. The Arabidopsis  genome carries two genes encoding LBP/BPI-related proteins which we designated as  AtLBP/BPI related-1 (AtLBR-1) and AtLBP/BPI related-2 (AtLBR-2). We found that  their N-terminal domains were co-purified with cell wall-derived LPS when  expressed in E. coli. Since this finding implied the direct binding of AtLBRs to  LPS, we also confirmed binding by using LPS-free AtLBRs and purified LPS. AtLBRs  directly bind to both rough and smooth types of LPS. We also demonstrated that  LPS-treated atlbr mutant Arabidopsis exhibit a significant delay of induction of  defence-related gene pathogenesis-related 1 (PR1) but no other PR genes.  Furthermore, LPS-treated atlbr mutants showed defects in reactive oxygen species  (ROS) generation. These results demonstrate that, as well as LBP and BPI of  mammals, AtLBRs also play an important role in the LPS-induced immune response of  plants.', '2016 Jun 8', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep27527', 'Nagano']
