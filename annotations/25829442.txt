['25829442', 'In angiosperms, the transition to the female gametophytic phase relies on the  specification of premeiotic gamete precursors from sporophytic cells in the  ovule. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a single diploid cell is specified as the  premeiotic female gamete precursor. Here, we show that ecotypes of Arabidopsis  exhibit differences in megasporogenesis leading to phenotypes reminiscent of  defects in dominant mutations that epigenetically affect the specification of  female gamete precursors. Intraspecific hybridization and polyploidy exacerbate  these defects, which segregate quantitatively in F2 populations derived from  ecotypic hybrids, suggesting that multiple loci control cell specification at the  onset of female meiosis. This variation in cell differentiation is influenced by  the activity of ARGONAUTE9 (AGO9) and RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6 (RDR6), two  genes involved in epigenetic silencing that control the specification of female  gamete precursors. The pattern of transcriptional regulation and localization of  AGO9 varies among ecotypes, and abnormal gamete precursors in ovules defective  for RDR6 share identity with ectopic gamete precursors found in selected  ecotypes. Our results indicate that differences in the epigenetic control of cell  specification lead to natural phenotypic variation during megasporogenesis. We  propose that this mechanism could be implicated in the emergence and evolution of  the reproductive alternatives that prevail in flowering plants.', '2015 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.133009', 'Vielle-Calzada']
