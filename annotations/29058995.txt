Autophagy is important for degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic materials in all eukaryotes and is often triggered by environmental stress. How autophagy is activated in plants under different environmental conditions is still poorly understood. Our recent studies show that induction of autophagy by different abiotic stress conditions can occur via either a TOR-dependent or -independent pathway, depending on the stress. The SnRK1 protein kinase complex acts upstream of TOR in regulation of autophagy during nutrient deficiency, salt and osmotic stresses. In contrast, oxidative and ER stress regulate autophagy in a SnRK1-dependent but TOR-independent manner. Here we summarize and discuss these distinct pathways for activation of autophagy under different environmental stress conditions.

SnRK1: !regulates! Autophagy
TOR: !regulates! Autophagy
Nutrient deficiency: !activates! SnRK1
Salt/osmotic stress: !activates! SnRK1
Oxidative stress: !activates! SnRK1
ER stress: !activates! SnRK1
