['8521490', 'Ovule development in Arabidopsis involves the formation of three morphologically  defined proximal-distal pattern elements. Integuments arise from the central  pattern element. Analysis of Bell 1 (Bel 1) mutant ovules indicated that BEL1 was  required for integument development. Cloning of the BEL1 locus reveals that it  encodes a homeodomain transcription factor. Prior to integument initiation, BEL1  RNA localizes to the central domain, providing molecular evidence for a central  pattern element. Therefore, proximal-distal patterning of the ovule involves the  regulated expression of the BEL1 gene that controls integument morphogenesis. A  model for BEL1 function is evaluated with regard to new data showing the  expression pattern of the floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) early in wild-type  and BEL1 ovule development.', '1995 Dec 1', 'Cell', '10.1016/0092-8674(95)90186-8', 'Fischer']
