Protein modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) plays an important role in multiple plant processes, including growth, development, and the response to abiotic stresses. Mechanistically, SUMOylation is a sequential multi-enzymatic process where SUMO E3 ligases accelerate SUMO conjugation while also influencing target identity and interactions. This review explores the biological functions of plant SUMO E3 ligases [SAP AND MIZ1 DOMAIN-CONTAINING LIGASE (SIZs), METHYL METHANESULFONATE-SENSITIVITY PROTEIN 21 (MMS21s), and PROTEIN INHIBITOR OF ACTIVATED STAT-LIKE (PIALs)] in relation to their molecular activities and domains. We also explore the sub-cellular localization of SUMO E3 ligases and review evidence suggesting a connection between certain SUMO E3 ligases and DNA that contributes to gene expression regulation.
