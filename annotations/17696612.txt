['17696612', 'MUS81 is conserved among plants, animals, and fungi and is known to be involved  in mitotic DNA damage repair and meiotic recombination. Here we present a  functional characterization of the Arabidopsis thaliana homolog AtMUS81, which  has a role in both mitotic and meiotic cells. The AtMUS81 transcript is produced  in all tissues, but is elevated greater than 9-fold in the anthers and its levels  are increased in response to gamma radiation and methyl methanesulfonate  treatment. An Atmus81 transfer-DNA insertion mutant shows increased sensitivity  to a wide range of DNA-damaging agents, confirming its role in mitotically  proliferating cells. To examine its role in meiosis, we employed a pollen  tetrad-based visual assay. Data from genetic intervals on Chromosomes 1 and 3  show that Atmus81 mutants have a moderate decrease in meiotic recombination.  Importantly, measurements of recombination in a pair of adjacent intervals on  Chromosome 5 demonstrate that the remaining crossovers in Atmus81 are  interference sensitive, and that interference levels in the Atmus81 mutant are  significantly greater than those in wild type. These data are consistent with the  hypothesis that AtMUS81 is involved in a secondary subset of meiotic crossovers  that are interference insensitive.', '2007 Aug', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.0030132', 'Copenhaver']
