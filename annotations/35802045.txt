Deployment of the Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b dwarfing genes helped facilitate the Green Revolution to increase wheat yields globally. Much is known of the influence of these genes on plant height and agronomic performance, but not of their effects on root architecture. We assessed 29 near-isogenic lines (NILs) representing 11 Green Revolution and alternative dwarfing genes across multiple genetic backgrounds for root architecture characteristics in controlled and field environments. Genetic background did not influence plant height, but had a small and significant (P<0.05) effect on root architecture. All dwarfing gene NILs were significantly (P<0.01) shorter compared with tall controls. The Green Revolution Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b sometimes had longer seedling roots but were not different from their respective tall controls for root depth in the field. The Rht8, Rht12, and Rht18 dwarfing gene NILs produced long seminal roots in seedling pouches, and a greater maximum rooting depth (MRD) and root penetration rate (RPR) in the field. Genotypic increases in MRD and RPR were strongly correlated with increased harvest index and grain yield, particularly in dry environments. Careful root phenotyping highlights the potential of novel dwarfing genes for wheat genetic improvement under water-limited conditions.
