Roots are essential for plant growth, and studies on root-related genes, exemplified by <i>WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX5</i> (<i>WOX5</i>), have mainly concentrated on model organisms with less emphasis on the function of these genes in woody plants. Here, we report that overexpression of the <i>WOX5</i> gene from <i>Liriodendron</i> hybrid (<i>LhWOX5</i>) in <i>Arabidopsis</i> leads to significant morphological changes in both the aerial and subterranean organs. In the <i>Arabidopsis</i> aerial parts, overexpression of <i>LhWOX5</i> results in the production of ectopic floral meristems and leaves, possibly via the ectopic activation of <i>CLV3</i> and <i>LFY</i>. In addition, in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> root, overexpression of <i>LhWOX5</i> alters root apical meristem morphology, leading to a curled and shortened primary root. Importantly, these abnormal phenotypes in the aerial and subterranean organs caused by constitutive ectopic expression of <i>LhWOX5</i> mimic the observed phenotypes when overexpressing <i>AtWUS</i> and <i>AtWOX5</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, respectively. Taken together, we propose that the <i>LhWOX</i>5 gene, originating from the Magnoliaceae plant <i>Liriodendron</i>, is a functional homolog of the <i>AtWUS</i> gene from <i>Arabidopsis</i>, while showing the highest degree of sequence similarity with its ortholog, <i>AtWOX5</i>. Our study provides insight into the potential role of <i>LhWOX5</i> in the development of both the shoot and root.
