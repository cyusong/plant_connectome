Roots are important conduits for the redistribution of water within the rooting zone. Root systems are often highly branched, and water flow between regions undoubtedly involves passage through junctions between individual roots. This study considered junctions in the roots of Douglas-fir with regard to the resistances encountered by water flow through the xylem. Flow into the root branch distally along the main root encountered much greater resistance than flow into the branch and proximally along the main root (toward the plant stem). When the main root proximal to the junction was gradually shortened, the resistance to flow in the branch root and distally along the main root increased dramatically. Thus, flow in this manner appears to depend on lateral flow within the root over many centimetres proximal to the junction and not just within the direct connection at the junction. These results suggest that the hydraulic nature of junctions is an important aspect of hydraulic redistribution of water within the soil utilizing flow through roots.
