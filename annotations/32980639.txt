Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) is a biennial plant that requires vernalization for flowering initiation. However, we previously showed that heat can induce root chicory flowering independently of vernalization. To deepen our understanding of the temperature control of flowering in this species, we investigated the impact of heat, vernalization and their interaction on flowering induction and reproductive development. Heat increased the flowering percentage of non-vernalized plants by 25% but decreased that of vernalized plants by 65%. After bolting, heat negatively affected inflorescence development, decreasing the proportion of sessile capitula on the floral stem by 40% and the floral stem dry weight by 42% compared to control conditions, although it did not affect the number of flowers per capitulum. Heat also decreased flower fertility: pollen production, pollen viability and stigma receptivity were respectively 25%, 3% and 82% lower in heat-treated plants than in untreated control plants. To investigate the genetic control of flowering by temperature in root chicory, we studied the expression of the FLC-LIKE1 (CiFL1) gene in response to heat; CiFL1 was previously shown to be repressed by vernalization in chicory and to repress flowering when over-expressed in Arabidopsis. Heat treatment increased CiFL1 expression, as well as the percentage of bolting and flowering shoot apices. Heat thus has a dual impact on flowering initiation in root chicory since it appears to both induce flowering and counteract vernalization. However, after floral transition, heat has a primarily negative impact on root chicory reproduction.
