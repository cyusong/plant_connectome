AGAMOUS subfamily proteins are encoded by MADS-box family genes. They have been shown to play key roles in the determination of reproductive floral organs such as stamens, carpels and ovules. However, they also play key roles in ensuring a fixed number of floral organs by controlling floral meristem determinacy. Recently, an enormous amount of sequence data for nonmodel species have become available together with functional data on AGAMOUS subfamily members in many species. Here, we give a detailed overview of the most important information about this interesting gene subfamily and provide new insights into its evolution.
