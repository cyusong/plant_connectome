According to some estimates, a 70% increase in crop yield could be achieved if the environmental conditions were close to the optimum ones for a given plant, which is why the identification and control of adverse environmental effects is a top priority in many countries worldwide. This paper contains a discussion of the changes in selected elements of the secondary metabolism in the leaves of two grapevine varieties (Vitis vinifera L.) with a different degree of tolerance to cold stress during prolonged and constant low temperature stress. The analyses have shown that the more-tolerant variety was characterized by a higher content of phenolic compounds, better radical-scavenging capacity and stronger reducing power. However, the cold stress caused a decrease in the concentration of the phenolics and decreased the scavenging capacity in the leaves of both varieties. Four phenolic acids have been identified in the extracts from the leaves of both grapevines: caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and a caffeic acid derivative. Caffeic acid appeared in the highest concentrations in all the leaf extracts. Additionally, it has been noted that in the leaves of the varieties susceptible and tolerant to cold stress, the prolonged exposure to low temperature caused a considerable reduction of the content of all identified phenolic acids. The results of the analyses have demonstrated large differences in the functioning of the secondary metabolism in response to the same stressor.
