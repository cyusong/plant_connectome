['30955882', 'During autophagy, vesicle dynamics and cargo recruitment are driven by numerous  adaptors and receptors that become tethered to the phagophore through  interactions with lipidated ATG8/LC3 decorating the expanding membrane. Most  currently described ATG8-binding proteins exploit a well-defined ATG8-interacting  motif (AIM, or LC3-interacting region [LIR]) that contacts a hydrophobic patch on  ATG8 known as the LIR/AIM docking site (LDS). Here we describe a new class of  ATG8 interactors that exploit ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)-like sequences  for high-affinity binding to an alternative ATG8 interaction site. Assays with  candidate UIM-containing proteins together with unbiased screens identified a  large collection of UIM-based ATG8 interactors in plants, yeast, and humans.  Analysis of a subset also harboring ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domains revealed  a role for UIM-directed autophagy in clearing non-functional CDC48/p97 complexes,  including some impaired in human disease. With this new class of adaptors and  receptors, we greatly extend the reach of selective autophagy and identify new  factors regulating autophagic vesicle dynamics.', '2019 Apr 18', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.009', 'Vierstra']
