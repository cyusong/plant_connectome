Insect pests and weeds are the two major biotic factors affecting crop yield in the modern agricultural system. In this study, a brown planthopper (BPH) resistance gene (BPH9) and glufosinate tolerance gene (bar) were stacked into a single T-DNA cassette and transformed into an indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) line Guangzhan 63-4S. A stable transgenic line H23 with a single T-DNA insert was generated, with the T-DNA cassette located on chromosome 3. Field resistance trial using H23 revealed high tolerance to glufosinate and excellent resistance to BPH. These results propose H23 as valuable germplasm for BPH-resistance and glufosinate-tolerance breeding in rice.

BPH9: !affects! BPH resistance
bar: !affects! glufosinate tolerance
T-DNA cassette: !localizes to! chromosome 3
H23: !exhibits! BPH resistance and glufosinate tolerance
H23: !provides! valuable germplasm for breeding
