['9536043', 'The ga2 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana is a gibberellin-deficient dwarf. Previous  biochemical studies have suggested that the ga2 mutant is impaired in the  conversion of copalyl diphosphate to ent-kaurene, which is catalyzed by  ent-kaurene synthase (KS). Overexpression of the previously isolated KS cDNA from  pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) (CmKS) in the ga2 mutant was able to complement the  mutant phenotype. A genomic clone coding for KS, AtKS, was isolated from A.  thaliana using CmKS cDNA as a heterologous probe. The corresponding A. thaliana  cDNA was isolated and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein. The  fusion protein showed enzymatic activity that converted [3H]copalyl diphosphate  to [3H]ent-kaurene. The recombinant AtKS protein derived from the ga2-1 mutant is  truncated by 14 kD at the C-terminal end and does not contain significant KS  activity in vitro. Sequence analysis revealed that a C-2099 to T base  substitution, which converts Gln-678 codon to a stop codon, is present in the  AtKS cDNA from the ga2-1 mutant. Taken together, our results show that the GA2  locus encodes KS.', '1998 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.116.4.1271', 'Kamiya']
