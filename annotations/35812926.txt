A strictly aerobic, chemoheterotrophic, endospore-forming, Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterial strain N3<sup>T</sup> was isolated from the feces of a river otter in Castril (Granada, southern Spain). It is halotolerant, motile, and catalase-, oxidase-, ACC deaminase-, and C4- and C8-lipase-positive. It promotes tomato plant growth and can reduce virulence in <i>Erwinia amylovora</i> CECT 222<sup>T</sup> and <i>Dickeya solani</i> LMG 25993<sup>T</sup> through interference in their quorum-sensing systems, although other antagonistic mechanisms could also occur. A phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence as well as the phenotypic and phylogenomic analyses indicated that the strain N3<sup>T</sup> is a novel species of the genus <i>Peribacillus</i>, with the highest 16S rRNA sequence similar to that of <i>Bacillus frigoritolerans</i> DSM 8801<sup>T</sup> (99.93%) and <i>Peribacillus simplex</i> DSM 1321<sup>T</sup> (99.80%). Genomic digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) between the strain N3<sup>T</sup> and <i>Bacillus frigoritolerans</i> DSM 8801<sup>T</sup> and <i>Peribacillus simplex</i> was 12.8 and 69.1%, respectively, and the average nucleotide identity (ANIb) of strain N3<sup>T</sup> and <i>Bacillus frigoritolerans</i> DSM 8801<sup>T</sup> and <i>Peribacillus simplex</i> was 67.84 and 93.21%, respectively. The genomic G + C content was 40.3 mol%. Its main cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C<sub>15:0</sub> and iso-C<sub>15:0</sub>. Using 16S rRNA phylogenetic and <i>in silico</i> phylogenomic analyses, together with the chemotaxonomic and phenotypic data, we demonstrated that the type strain N3<sup>T</sup> (=CECT 30509<sup>T</sup> = LMG 32505<sup>T</sup>) is a novel species of the genus <i>Peribacillus</i> and the name <i>Peribacillus castrilensis</i> sp. nov. is proposed.
