A fundamental question in biology is how organisms integrate the plethora of environmental cues that they perceive to trigger a co-ordinated response. The regulation of protein stability, which is largely mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes, plays a pivotal role in these processes. Due to their sessile lifestyle and the need to respond rapidly to a multitude of environmental factors, plants are thought to be especially dependent on proteolysis to regulate cellular processes. In this review, we present the complexity of the ubiquitin system in plants, and discuss the relevance of the proteolytic and non-proteolytic roles of this system in the regulation and co-ordination of plant responses to environmental signals. We also discuss the role of the ubiquitin system as a key regulator of plant signaling pathways. We focus more specifically on the functions of E3 ligases as regulators of the jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and ethylene hormone signaling pathways that play important roles to mount a co-ordinated response to multiple environmental stresses. We also provide examples of new players in this field that appear to integrate different cues and signaling pathways.

ubiquitin-proteasome system: !regulates! protein stability 
E3 ligases: !regulate! JA, SA, and ethylene hormone signaling pathways 
environmental cues: !trigger! co-ordinated response 
new players: !integrate! different cues and signaling pathways
