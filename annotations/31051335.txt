Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) formation enhances plant growth and fitness through improved uptake of water and mineral nutrients in exchange for carbon compounds to the AM fungus. The fungal structure for the reciprocal exchange of nutrients in the symbiosis is the arbuscule, and defence genes expressed in cells containing arbuscules could play a role in the control of hyphal spread and arbuscule formation in the root. We characterized and analyzed the Ptc52 gene from tomato (SlPtc52), a member of the gene family of non-heme oxygenases, whose function has been related to the lethal leaf spot 1 (Lls1) lesion mimic phenotype in plants which is sometimes associated with enhanced disease resistance. Sequence analysis of the SlPTC52 protein revealed conserved typical motifs from non-heme oxygenases, including a Rieske [2Fe-2S] motif, a mononuclear non-heme iron-binding motif and a C-terminal CxxC motif. The level of transcript accumulation was low in stem, flower and green fruits, and high in leaves. Although SlPtc52 expression was perceptible at low levels in roots, its expression increased concomitantly with AM fungus root colonization. Tomato non-mycorrhizal hairy roots expressing the GUS protein under the control of promoter SlPtc52 exhibited GUS activity in the endodermis, the apical meristem of the root tip and in the lateral root primordium. AM fungal colonization also resulted in intensive GUS activity that clearly corresponds to cortical cells containing arbuscules. SlPtc52 gene silencing led to a delay in root colonization and a decrease in arbuscular abundance, suggesting that SlPTC52 plays a regulatory role during AM symbiosis.
