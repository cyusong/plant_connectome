['15155879', 'Light, in a quality- and quantity-dependent fashion, induces nuclear import of  the plant photoreceptors phytochrome, promotes interaction of phytochrome A  (phyA) and phyB with transcription factors including phytochrome interacting  factor 3 (PIF3), and is thought to trigger a transcriptional cascade to regulate  the expression of approximately 2500 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we show  that controlled degradation of the transcription factor PIF3 is a major  regulatory step in light signaling. We demonstrate that accumulation of PIF3 in  the nucleus in dark requires constitutive photomorphogenesis 1 (COP1), a negative  regulator of photomorphogenesis, and show that red (R) and far-red light (FR)  induce rapid degradation of the PIF3 protein. This process is controlled by the  concerted action of the R/FR absorbing phyA, phyB, and phyD photoreceptors, and  it is not affected by COP1. Rapid light-induced degradation of PIF3 indicates  that interaction of PIF3 with these phytochrome species is transient. In  addition, we provide evidence that the poc1 mutant, a postulated PIF3  overexpressor that displays hypersensitivity to R but not to FR, lacks detectable  amounts of the PIF3 protein. Thus, we propose that PIF3 acts transiently, and its  major function is to mediate phytochrome-induced signaling during the  developmental switch from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis and/or dark to  light transitions.', '2004 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.021568', 'Nagy']
