The NAC transcription factors play vital roles in responding to drought stress in plants; however, the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown in cucumber. Suppression of CsATAF1 via RNA interference (RNAi) weakened drought stress tolerance in cucumber due to a higher water loss rate in leaves, a higher level of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radicals (O2·-), increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, lower Fv/Fm ratios and lower antioxidant enzyme activity. The analysis of root length and stomatal apertures showed that CsATAF1-RNAi cucumber plants were less responsive to ABA. In contrast, CsATAF1-overexpression (OE) plants showed increased drought stress tolerance and sensitivity to ABA. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that expression of several stress-responsive genes was significantly up-regulated in CsATAF1-OE transformants and down-regulated in CsATAF1-RNAi transformants. CsABI5, CsCu-ZnSOD and CsDREB2C were verified as direct target genes of CsATAF1. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) further substantiated that CsATAF1 bound to the promoters of CsABI5, CsCu-ZnSOD and CsDREB2C. Transient expression in tobacco leaves and cucumber protoplasts showed that CsATAF1 directly up-regulated the expression of CsABI5, CsCu-ZnSOD and CsDREB2C. Our results demonstrated that CsATAF1 functioned as a positive regulator in response to drought stress by an ABA-dependent pathway and decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in cucumber.
