Photosynthetic organisms support cell metabolism by harvesting sunlight and driving the electron transport chain at the level of thylakoid membranes. Excitation energy and electron flow in the photosynthetic apparatus is continuously modulated in response to dynamic environmental conditions. Alternative electron flow around photosystem I plays a seminal role in this regulation contributing to photoprotection by mitigating overreduction of the electron carriers. Different pathways of alternative electron flow coexist in the moss Physcomitrella patens, including cyclic electron flow mediated by the PGRL1/PGR5 complex and pseudo-cyclic electron flow mediated by the flavodiiron proteins FLV. In this work, we generated P. patens plants carrying both pgrl1 and flva knock-out mutations. A comparative analysis of the WT, pgrl1, flva, and pgrl1 flva lines suggests that cyclic and pseudo-cyclic processes have a synergic role in the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport. However, although both contribute to photosystem I protection from overreduction by modulating electron flow following changes in environmental conditions, FLV activity is particularly relevant in the first seconds after a light change whereas PGRL1 has a major role upon sustained strong illumination.
