['26662452', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes 56 subtilisin-like serine proteases  (subtilases). In order to evaluate the protease activity of a previously  uncharacterized subtilase, designated as AtSBT1.9, we cloned its full-length cDNA  from A. thaliana seedlings. An AtSBT1.9 mature peptide coding sequence was  inserted into the bacterial expression vector, pMAL-c2x, and the recombinant  vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant AtSBT1.9  tagged by maltose binding protein (MBP) was induced as a 117.5-kDa protein in the  soluble form in E. coli BL21 (DE3). MBP-AtSBT1.9 was expressed at a level of 11%  (w/w) of the bacterial total protein. Protein purification using Amylose Resin  revealed a recombinant AtSBT1.9 protease activity of 9.23 U/mg protein at pH 7  and 25 degrees C. Maximal activity occurred over a broad pH (7-8) and temperature  (25 degrees -42 degrees C) optimal range. Validation of AtSBT1.9 protease activity would help in  characterizing its in vivo function in A. thaliana.', '2015 Dec 9', 'Genet Mol Res', '10.4238/2015.December.9.25', 'Cai']
