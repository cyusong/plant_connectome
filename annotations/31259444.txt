Centromeres mediate chromosome attachment to microtubules and maintain the integrity of chromosomes for proper segregation of the sister chromatids during cell division. Advances in the assembly of Triticeae genome sequences combined with the capacity to recover hybrid species derived from very distantly related species provides potential experimental systems for linking retrotransposon amplification and repositioning of centromeres via non-mendelian inheritance in partial amphiploid breeds. The decaploid tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum) is one of the most successfully used perennial species in wheat breeding for generating translocation lines with valuable agronomic traits. We found that wheat centromere retrotransposons CRW and Quinta widely occur within the tall wheatgrass genome. In addition, one of the genome donors to Th. ponticum, Pseudoroegneria stipifolia (StSt), has been shown to have Abigail and a satellite repeat, CentSt. We also found two other centromeric retrotransposons, Abia and CL135 in Th. ponticum by ChIP-seq. Examination of partial amphiploid lines that were generated in the 1970s demonstrated extensive modification in centromere sequences using CentSt, Abigail and Abia as probes. We also detected that St-genome chromosomes were more enriched with Abigail and CentSt, whereas E-genome chromosomes were enriched with CRW and Quinta in tall wheatgrass and its closer relatives. It can be concluded that bursts of transposition of retrotransposons and repositioning of centromeres via non-mendelian segregation are common in partial amphiploids derived from interspecific hybrids. Practically speaking, our study reveals that the existence of homologous centromere functional sequences in both a donor and its receptor can substantially contribute to the successful transfer of alien genes into crop species.
