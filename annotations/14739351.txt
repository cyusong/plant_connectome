['14739351', 'The Arabidopsis AtSUC3 gene encodes a sucrose (Suc) transporter that differs in  size and intron number from all other Arabidopsis Suc transport proteins. Each  plant species analyzed so far possesses one transporter of this special type, and  several functions have been discussed for these proteins, including the catalysis  of transmembrane Suc transport, and also Suc sensing and regulation of other Suc  transporters. Here, we show that the AtSUC3 protein is localized in the sieve  elements of the Arabidopsis phloem and is not colocalized with the companion  cell-specific AtSUC2 phloem loader. Even stronger AtSUC3 expression is observed  in numerous sink cells and tissues, such as guard cells, trichomes, germinating  pollen, root tips, the developing seed coat, or stipules. Moreover, AtSUC3  expression is strongly induced upon wounding of Arabidopsis tissue. The  physiological role of AtSUC3 in these different cells and tissues is discussed.', '2004 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.033399', 'Sauer']
