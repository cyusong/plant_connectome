['19110459', 'In addition to RNA polymerases I, II, and III, the essential RNA polymerases  present in all eukaryotes, plants have two additional nuclear RNA polymerases,  abbreviated as Pol IV and Pol V, that play nonredundant roles in siRNA-directed  DNA methylation and gene silencing. We show that Arabidopsis Pol IV and Pol V are  composed of subunits that are paralogous or identical to the 12 subunits of Pol  II. Four subunits of Pol IV are distinct from their Pol II paralogs, six subunits  of Pol V are distinct from their Pol II paralogs, and four subunits differ  between Pol IV and Pol V. Importantly, the subunit differences occur in key  positions relative to the template entry and RNA exit paths. Our findings support  the hypothesis that Pol IV and Pol V are Pol II-like enzymes that evolved  specialized roles in the production of noncoding transcripts for RNA silencing  and genome defense.', '2009 Jan 30', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/j.molcel.2008.12.015', 'Pikaard']
