Brassica rapa includes several important leafy vegetable crops with the potential for high cadmium (Cd) accumulation, posing a risk to human health. This study aims to understand the genetic basis underlying the variation in Cd accumulation among B. rapa vegetables. Cd uptake and translocation in 64 B. rapa accessions were compared. The role of the heavy metal ATPase gene BrHMA3 in the variation of Cd accumulation was investigated. BrHMA3 encodes a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter. Five full-length and four truncated haplotypes of the BrHMA3 coding sequence were identified, explaining >80% of the variation in the Cd root to shoot translocation among the 64 accessions and in F2 progeny. Truncated BrHMA3 haplotypes had a 2.3 and 9.3 times higher shoot Cd concentration and Cd translocation ratio, respectively, than full-length haplotypes. When expressed in yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana, full-length BrHMA3 showed activity consistent with a Cd transport function, whereas truncated BrHMA3 did not. Variation in the BrHMA3 promoter sequence had little effect on Cd translocation. Variation in the BrHMA3 coding sequence is a key determinant of Cd translocation to and accumulation in the leaves of B. rapa. Strong alleles of BrHMA3 can be used to breed for B. rapa vegetables that are low in Cd in their edible portions.
