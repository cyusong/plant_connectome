In most reviews on Chl biosynthesis, Chl is described as being synthesized via the route involving the reduction of [3,8-divinyl]-protochlorophyllide a. However, the possibility remains that the conversion of the divinyl form of the Chl intermediate to its monovinyl form takes place at other enzymatic steps. To determine the actual route of Chl biosynthesis, we examined the substrate specificity of the formerly named [3,8-divinyl]-protochlorophyllide a 8-vinyl reductase (DVR) in vitro. In addition, we investigated the accumulation of various Chl intermediates in etiolated seedlings in vivo. Collectively, these studies indicate that [3,8-divinyl]-chlorophyllide a is the major substrate of DVR.
