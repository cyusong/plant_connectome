Germination of soybean seed is the imminent vital process after sowing. The status of plumular axis and radicle determine whether soybean seed can emerge normally. Epicotyl, an organ between cotyledons and first functional leaves, is essential for soybean seed germination, seedling growth and early morphogenesis. Epicotyl length (EL) is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes/QTLs. Here, the present study analyzes the phenotypic diversity and genetic basis of EL using 951 soybean improved cultivars and landraces from Asia, America, Europe and Africa. 3VmrMLM was used to analyze the associations between EL in 2016 and 2020 and 1,639,846 SNPs for the identification of QTNs and QTN-by-environment interactions (QEIs)".A total of 180 QTNs and QEIs associated with EL were detected. Among them, 74 QTNs (ELS_Q) and 16 QEIs (ELS_QE) were identified to be associated with ELS (epicotyl length of single plant emergence), and 60 QTNs (ELT_Q) and 30 QEIs (ELT_QE) were identified to be associated with ELT (epicotyl length of three seedlings). Based on transcript abundance analysis, GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment and haplotype analysis, ten candidate genes were predicted within nine genic SNPs located in introns, upstream or downstream, which were supposed to be directly or indirectly involved in the process of seed germination and seedling development., Of 10 candidate genes, two of them (Glyma.04G122400 and Glyma.18G183600) could possibly affect epicotyl length elongation. These results indicate the genetic basis of EL and provides a valuable basis for specific functional studies of epicotyl traits.
