['12941880', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana AHK4 histidine kinase (also known as CRE1 or WOL) acts  as a cytokinin signal transducer, presumably, in concert with downstream  components, such as histidine-containing phosphotransfer factors (AHPs) and  response regulators (ARRs), through the histidine-to-aspartate (His-->Asp)  phosphorelay. Among 10 members of the type-A ARR family, the cytokinin-induced  expression of ARR15 in roots is selectively impaired in the cre1-1 mutant, which  carries a mutation in the AHK4 gene, suggesting a link between this type-A  response regulator and the AHK4-mediated cytokinin signal transduction in roots.  To address this issue further, we characterized a T-DNA insertion mutant of  ARR15, and also constructed transgenic lines (referred to as ARR15-ox) that  overexpress the ARR15 gene in a manner independent of cytokinin. While the T-DNA  insertion mutant (arr15-1) showed no apparent phenotype, the  cytokinin-independent overexpression of ARR15 in ARR15-ox plants resulted in a  reduced sensitivity toward exogenously applied cytokinin, not only in elongation  of roots in plants, but also in green callus formation (or shoot formation) in  explants. Cytokinin-induced expressions of certain type-A ARRs were also  down-regulated in ARR15-ox plants. These results support the view that ARR15 acts  as a repressor that mediates a negative feedback loop in the cytokinin and  AHK4-mediated His-->Asp phosphorelay.', '2003 Aug', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcg108', 'Mizuno']
