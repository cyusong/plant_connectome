With the domestication of ornamental plants, artificial selective pressure favored the propagation of mutations affecting flower shape, and double-flower varieties are now readily available for many species. In peach two distinct loci control the double-flower phenotype: the dominant Di2 locus, regulated by the deletion of the binding site for miR172 in the euAP2 PETALOSA gene Prupe.6G242400, and the recessive di locus, of which the underlying factor is still unknown. Based on its genomic location a candidate gene approach was used to identify genetic variants in a diverse panel of ornamental peach accessions and uncovered three independent mutations in Prupe.2G237700, the gene encoding the transcript for microRNA miR172d: a ~5.0 Kb LTR transposable element and a ~1.2 Kb insertion both positioned upstream of the sequence encoding the pre-miR172d within the transcribed region of Prupe.2G237700, and a ~9.5 Kb deletion encompassing the whole gene sequence. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that expression of pre-miR172d was abolished in di/di genotypes homozygous for the three variants. Collectively, PETALOSA and the mutations in micro-RNA miR172d identified in this work provide a comprehensive collection of the genetic determinants at the base of the double-flower trait in the peach germplasms.
