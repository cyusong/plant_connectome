['33526654', 'Gene expression is reconfigured rapidly during the cell cycle to execute the  cellular functions specific to each phase. Studies conducted with synchronized  plant cell suspension cultures have identified hundreds of genes with periodic  expression patterns across the phases of the cell cycle, but these results may  differ from expression occurring in the context of intact organs. Here, we  describe the use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting to analyze the gene  expression profile of G2/M cells in the growing root. To this end, we isolated  cells expressing the early mitosis cell cycle marker CYCLINB1;1-GFP from  Arabidopsis root tips. Transcriptome analysis of these cells allowed  identification of hundreds of genes whose expression is reduced or enriched in  G2/M cells, including many not previously reported from cell suspension cultures.  From this dataset, we identified SCL28, a transcription factor belonging to the  GRAS family, whose messenger RNA accumulates to the highest levels in G2/M and is  regulated by MYB3R transcription factors. Functional analysis indicates that  SCL28 promotes progression through G2/M and modulates the selection of cell  division planes.', '2021 Feb 9', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.2005256118', 'ORCID:']
