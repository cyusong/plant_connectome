Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that are continuously shaped by the antagonistic fission and fusion processes. The major machineries of mitochondrial fission and fusion, as well as mechanisms that regulate the function of key players in these processes have been analyzed in different experimental systems. In plants however, the mitochondrial fusion machinery is still largely unknown, and the regulatory mechanisms of the fission machinery are just beginning to be elucidated. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying plant mitochondrial dynamics and regulation of some of the key factors, especially the roles of membrane lipids such as cardiolipin.
