Metal ions essential for plant growth, such as Fe, Mn, Ni, Cu or Zn, are taken up by plants from the soil solution through metal transporters at the plasma membrane, mainly of the ZIP and Nramp families. These transport systems, however, can also give entry to other metals (Al, Cd, Hg, Pb). Non-nutritive elements, as well as the essential nutrients at higher than metabolic concentrations, can cause phytotoxicity. We have studied previously the effects of an essential (Ni) and a non essential (Cd) heavy metal on root cell plasma membranes, the first selective barrier encountered when entering the plant, using rice as model plant. Distinctive effects of Cd and Ni on membrane function (i.e., Em and membrane permeability) were observed in the short term. We have now confirmed the pattern of Em changes caused by Cd and Ni using barley roots and have also followed the effects of both metals in longer term in rice. Our data indicate that the distinct effects caused by Cd and Ni are due to differences in cellular responses, triggered when entering the cytoplasm (i.e., an efficient detoxifying mechanism for Cd), more than to different direct effects on membranes.
