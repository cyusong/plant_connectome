['36578335', 'The integrity of plant genetic information is constantly challenged by various  internal and external factors. Therefore, plants use a sophisticated molecular  network to identify, signal and repair damaged DNA. Here, we report on the  identification and analysis of four uncharacterized Arabidopsis BRCT5 DOMAIN  CONTAINING PROTEINs (BCPs). Proteins with the BRCT5 domain are frequently  involved in the maintenance of genome stability across eukaryotes. The screening  for sensitivity to induced DNA damage identified BCP1 as the most interesting  candidate. We show that BCP1 loss of function mutants are hypersensitive to  various types of DNA damage and accumulate an increased number of dead cells in  root apical meristems upon DNA damage. Analysis of publicly available sog1  transcriptomic and SOG1 genome-wide DNA binding data revealed that BCP1 is  inducible by gamma radiation and is a direct target of this key DNA damage  signaling transcription factor. Importantly, bcp1 plants showed a reduced  frequency of somatic homologous recombination in response to both endogenous and  induced DNA damage. Altogether, we identified a novel plant-specific DNA repair  factor that acts downstream of SOG1 in homology-based repair.', '2022', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2022.1023358', 'Pecinka']
