The aspartic protease (FeAP9) gene from buckwheat resembles the exon-intron structure characteristic for typical aspartic proteinases, including the presence of the leader intron in the 5'-UTR. RT PCR experiments and gel protein blot analysis indicated that FeAP9 was present in all analyzed organs: developing seeds, seedlings, flowers, leaves, roots and stems. Using Real-time PCR, we found that FeAP9 expression is upregulated in buckwheat leaves under the influence of different abiotic stresses, including dark, drought and UV-B light, as well as wounding and salicylic acid.
