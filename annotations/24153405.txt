['24153405', 'Proteins containing nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domains (NB-LRRs)  serve as immune receptors in plants and animals. Negative regulation of immunity  mediated by NB-LRR proteins is crucial, as their overactivation often leads to  autoimmunity. Here we describe a new mutant, snc1-enhancing (muse) forward  genetic screen, targeting unknown negative regulators of NB-LRR-mediated  resistance in Arabidopsis. From the screen, we identify MUSE5, which is renamed  as AtPAM16 because it encodes the ortholog of yeast PAM16, part of the  mitochondrial inner membrane protein import motor. Consistently, AtPAM16-GFP  localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane. AtPAM16L is a paralog of AtPAM16.  Double mutant Atpam16-1 Atpam16l is lethal, indicating that AtPAM16 function is  essential. Single mutant Atpam16 plants exhibit a smaller size and enhanced  resistance against virulent pathogens. They also display elevated reactive oxygen  species (ROS) accumulation. Therefore, AtPAM16 seems to be involved in importing  a negative regulator of plant immunity into mitochondria, thus protecting plants  from over-accumulation of ROS and preventing autoimmunity.', '2013', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms3558', 'Li']
