['26940493', 'Ubiquitin mediated protein degradation constitutes one of the most complex post  translational gene regulation mechanisms in eukaryotes. This fine-tuned  proteolytic machinery is based on a vast number of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes  that mark target proteins with ubiquitin. The specificity is accomplished by a  number of adaptor proteins that contain functional binding domains, including the  WD40 repeat motif (WDRs). To date, only few of these proteins have been  identified in plants. An RNAi mediated silencing approach was used here to  functionally characterize the Arabidopsis thaliana ULCS1 gene, which encodes for  a small molecular weight WDR protein. AtULCS1 interacts with the E3Cullin Ring  Ligase subunit DDB1a, regulating most likely the degradation of specific proteins  involved in the manifestation of diverse developmental events. Silencing of  AtULCS1 results in sterile plants with pleiotropic phenotypes. Detailed analysis  revealed that infertility is the outcome of anther indehiscence, which in turn is  due to the impairment of the plants to accomplish secondary wall modifications.  Furthermore, IREGULAR XYLEM gene expression and lignification is diminished in  anther endothecium and the stem vascular tissue of the silenced plants. These  data underline the importance of AtULCS1 in plant development and reproduction.', '2016 Apr', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2016.01.008', 'Haralampidis']
