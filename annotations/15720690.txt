* Hydroponic studies suggest that plant nitrogen (N) demand determines the rate of mineral N uptake; however, field observations show N limitation to be widespread. Field experiments are needed to understand soil factors controlling mineral N uptake. * We planted Picea engelmannii seedlings that had initially been grown from sterilized seeds, on a recently clearcut site. We applied a hybrid isotope dilution/pulse labelling technique to compare the gross production rate, concomitantly to the plant uptake rate, of soil mineral N. We also measured mineral N concentrations, microbial N, and percent ectomycorrhizal root tips. * Gross NH4+ production rate was the most important determinant of plant uptake rate. Exploratory path analysis suggested that plant uptake was also determined by microbial N, which was, in turn, determined by soil mineral N concentrations. Percent ectomycorrhizal root tips was negatively related to gross NO3- production rate and microbial N concentrations. * We conclude that nutrient flux density is important in controlling plant uptake. Mycorrhizal colonization may alter N dynamics in the rhizosphere without affecting mineral N uptake by seedlings.
