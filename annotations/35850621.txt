The unprecedented drought and frequent occurrence of pathogen infection in rice is becoming more due to climate change. Simultaneous occurrence of stresses lead to more crop loss. To cope up multiple stresses, the durable resistant cultivars needs to be developed, by identifying relevant genes from combined biotic and abiotic stress exposed plants. We studied the effect of drought stress, bacterial leaf blight disease causing Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) pathogen infection and combined stress in contrasting BPT5204 and TN1 rice genotypes. Mild drought stress increased Xoo infection irrespective of the genotype. To identify relevant genes that could be used to develop multi-stress tolerant rice, RNA sequencing from individual drought, pathogen and combined stresses in contrasting genotypes has been developed. Many important genes are identified from resistant genotype and diverse group of genes are differentially expressed in contrasting genotypes under combined stress. Further, a meta-analysis from individual drought and Xoo pathogen stress from public domain data sets narrowed- down candidate differentially expressed genes. Many translation associated genes are differentially expressed suggesting their extra-ribosomal function in multi-stress adaptation. Overexpression of many of these genes showed their relevance in improving stress tolerance in rice by different scientific groups. In combined stress, many downregulated genes also showed their relevance in stress adaptation when they were over-expressed. Our study identifies many important genes, which can be used as molecular markers and targets for genetic manipulation to develop durable resistant rice cultivars. Strategies should be developed to activate downregulated genes, to improve multi-stress tolerance in plants.
