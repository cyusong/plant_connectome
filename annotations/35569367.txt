Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase 21 (OsCPK21) is specifically and highly expressed throughout reproductive development and plays a critical role in rice pollen development by indirectly regulating the MIKC*-type MADS box transcription factor. However, little is known about the function of OsCPK21 in rice caryopsis development. In this study, we performed an in vitro pull-down experiment followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis and identified hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (HSD2) as a candidate OsCPK21-interacting protein in 25 DAF (days after flowering) rice caryopses. Then, we verified the interaction between OsCPK21 and OsHSD2 using yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence assays and revealed the in vitro phosphorylation of OsHSD2 by OsCPK21. Furthermore, oscpk21 and oshsd2 mutants were generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, and we found that the lipid profiles were drastically changed in both oscpk21 and oshsd2, implying that OsHSD2 phosphorylated by OsCPK21 regulates lipid abundance in caryopsis development, thereby providing a potential target for the genetic improvement of rice grain quality in future lipid-related breeding and biotechnology applications.
