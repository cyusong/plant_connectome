Autophagy is a highly conserved degradative pathway that ensures cellular homeostasis through the removal of damaged or useless intracellular components including proteins, membranes, or even entire organelles. A main hallmark of autophagy is the biogenesis of autophagosomes, double-membrane vesicles that engulf and transport to the vacuole the material to be degraded and recycled. The formation of autophagosomes responds to integrated signals produced as a consequence of metabolic reactions or different types of stress and is mediated by the coordinated action of core autophagy-related (ATG) proteins. ATG4 is a key Cys-protease with a dual function in both ATG8 lipidation and free ATG8 recycling whose balance is crucial for proper biogenesis of the autophagosome. ATG4 is conserved in the green lineage, and its regulation by different post-translational modifications has been reported in the model systems Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Arabidopsis. In this review, we discuss the major role of ATG4 in the integration of stress and redox signals that regulate autophagy in algae and plants.
