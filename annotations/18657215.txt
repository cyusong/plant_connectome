Recent studies demonstrating an in situ formation of methane (CH(4)) within foliage and separate observations that soil-derived CH(4) can be released from the stems of trees have continued the debate about the role of vegetation in CH(4) emissions to the atmosphere. Here, a study of the role of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the formation of CH(4) and other trace gases from plant pectins in vitro and from leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in planta is reported. Plant pectins were investigated for CH(4 )production under UV irradiation before and after de-methylesterification and with and without the singlet oxygen scavenger 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO). Leaves of tobacco were also investigated under UV irradiation and following leaf infiltration with the singlet oxygen generator rose bengal or the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Results demonstrated production of CH(4), ethane and ethylene from pectins and from tobacco leaves following all treatments, that methyl-ester groups of pectin are a source of CH(4), and that reactive oxygen species (ROS) arising from environmental stresses have a potential role in mechanisms of CH(4) formation. Rates of CH(4 )production were lower than those previously reported for intact plants in sunlight but the results clearly show that foliage can emit CH(4) under aerobic conditions.

DABCO: !scavenges! singlet oxygen
rose bengal: !generates! singlet oxygen
Pseudomonas syringae: !induces! CH4 production
methyl-ester groups: !are source of! CH4
ROS: !have potential role in! CH4 formation
