['23362208', 'The differentiation of hair (H) and non-hair (N) cells in the Arabidopsis  thaliana root epidermis is dependent on positional relationships with underlying  cortical cells. We previously found that histone acetylation relays positional  information and that a mutant altered in the histone deacetylase gene family  member HISTONE DEACETYLASE 18 (HDA18) exhibits altered H and N epidermal cell  patterning. Here, we report that HDA18 has in vitro histone deacetylase activity  and that both mutation and overexpression of HDA18 led to cells at the N position  having H fate. The HDA18 protein physically interacted with histones related to a  specific group of kinase genes, which are demonstrated in this study to be  components of a positional information relay system. Both down- and upregulation  of HDA18 increased transcription of the targeted kinase genes. Interestingly, the  acetylation levels of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9), histone 3 lysine 14 (H3K14) and  histone 3 lysine 18 (H3K18) at the kinase genes were differentially affected by  down- or upregulation of HDA18, which explains why the transcription levels of  the four HDA18-target kinase genes increased in all lines with altered HDA18  expression. Our results reveal the surprisingly complex mechanism by which HDA18  affects cellular patterning in Arabidopsis root epidermis.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.107045', 'Bai']
