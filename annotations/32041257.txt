In the model species <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>FRIGIDA</i> (<i>FRI</i>) is a key regulator of flowering time and can inhibit flowering without vernalization. However, little information is available on the function in the Rosaceae family. Loquat (<i>Eriobotrya japonica</i>) belongs to the family Rosaceae and is a distinctive species, in which flowering can be induced without vernalization, followed by blooming in late-autumn or winter. To investigate the functional roles of <i>FRI</i> orthologs in this non-vernalization species, we isolated an <i>FRI</i> ortholog, dubbed as <i>EjFRI</i>, from loquat. Analyses of the phylogenetic tree and protein sequence alignment showed that EjFRI is assigned to eurosids I FRI lineage. Expression analysis revealed that the highest expression level of <i>EjFRI</i> was after flower initiation. Meanwhile, <i>EjFRI</i> was widely expressed in different tissues. Subcellular localization of EjFRI was only detected to be in the nucleus. Ectopic expression of <i>EjFRI</i> in wild-type Arabidopsis delayed flowering time. The expression levels of <i>EjFRI</i> in transgenic wild-type Arabidopsis were significantly higher than those of nontransgenic wild-type lines. However, the expression levels of <i>AtFRI</i> showed no significant difference between transgenic and nontransgenic wild-type lines. Furthermore, the upregulated <i>AtFLC</i> expression in the transgenic lines indicated that <i>EjFRI</i> functioned similarly to the <i>AtFRI</i> of the model plant Arabidopsis. Our study provides a foundation to further explore the characterization of <i>EjFRI</i>, and also contributes to illuminating the molecular mechanism about flowering in loquat.
