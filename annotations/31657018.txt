Variation in xylem conduit diameter traditionally has been explained by climate, whereas other evidence suggests that tree height is the main driver of conduit diameter. The effect of climate versus stem length on vessel diameter was tested in two tree species (Embothrium coccineum, Nothofagus antarctica) that both span an exceptionally wide precipitation gradient (2300-500 mm). To see whether, when taking stem length into account, plants in wetter areas had wider vessels, not only the scaling of vessel diameter at the stem base across individuals of different heights, but also the tip-to-base scaling along individuals of similar heights across sites were examined. Within each species, plants of similar heights had similar mean vessel diameters and similar tip-to-base widening of vessel diameter, regardless of climate, with the slopes and intercepts of the vessel diameter-stem length relationship remaining invariant within species across climates. This study focusing on within-species variation--thus, avoiding noise associated with the great morphological variation across species--showed unequivocally that plant size, not climate, is the main driver of variation in vessel diameter. Therefore, to the extent that climate selects for differing vessel diameters, it will inevitably also affect plant height.
