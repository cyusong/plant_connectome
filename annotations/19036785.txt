The alpha subunit of plant heterotrimeric G proteins (Galpha) plays pivotal roles in multiple aspects of development and responses to plant hormones. Recently, several lines of evidence have shown that Galpha participates in brassinosteroid (BR) responses in Arabidopsis and rice plants. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the roles of the rice Galpha in the responses to BR using a defective mutant of the Galpha gene, T65d1. Decreased sensitivity to 24-epi-brassinolide (24-epiBL) in the T65d1 mutant was observed in many processes examined, e.g. in the inhibition of root growth and the promotion of coleoptile elongation. The T65d1 mutant also showed similar phenotypes to those of BR-deficient mutants, such as the specifically shortened second internode and the constitutive photomorphogenic growth phenotype under dark conditions. However, a negative feedback effect by 24-epiBL on the expression of BR biosynthetic genes was observed in the T65d1 mutant, and the levels of BR intermediates did not fluctuate in this mutant. To determine the epistatic relationship between the T65d1 mutant and d61-7, a weak allele of a rice BR receptor mutant, the two mutants were crossed. The T65d1/d61-7 double mutant showed no epistasis in the elongation inhibition of the internodes, the internode elongation pattern, the leaf angle and the morphological abnormality of leaf, except for the vertical length of seed and the seed weight. Our results suggest that the rice Galpha affects the BR signaling cascade but the Galpha may not be a signaling molecule in BRI1-meditated perception/transduction.
