['24012484', 'Postzygotic reproductive isolation in response to interploidy hybridizations is a  well-known phenomenon in plants that forms a major path for sympatric speciation.  A main determinant for the failure of interploidy hybridizations is the  endosperm, a nutritious tissue supporting embryo growth, similar to the  functional role of the placenta in mammals. Although it has been suggested that  deregulated imprinted genes underpin dosage sensitivity of the endosperm, the  molecular basis for this phenomenon remained unknown. In a genetic screen for  suppressors of triploid seed abortion, we have identified the paternally  expressed imprinted gene ADMETOS (ADM). Here, we present evidence that increased  dosage of ADM causes triploid seed arrest. A large body of theoretical work  predicted that deregulated imprinted genes establish the barrier to interploidy  hybridization. Our study thus provides evidence strongly supporting this  hypothesis and generates the molecular basis for our understanding of postzygotic  hybridization barriers in plants.', '2013 Sep 16', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2013.08.006', 'Kohler']
