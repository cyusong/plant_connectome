YUC flavin monooxygenases catalyze the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis. Here we report the vacuolar targeting and degradation of GFP-YUC1. GFP-YUC1 fusion expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts or transgenic plants was primarily localized in vacuoles. Surprisingly, we established that GFP-YUC1, a soluble protein, was sorted to vacuoles through the ESCRT pathway, which has long been recognized for sorting and targeting integral membrane proteins. We further show that GFP-YUC1 was ubiquitinated and in this form GFP-YUC1 was targeted for degradation, a process that was also stimulated by elevated auxin levels. Our findings revealed a molecular mechanism of GFP-YUC1 degradation and demonstrate that the ESCRT pathway can recognize both soluble and integral membrane proteins as cargoes.
