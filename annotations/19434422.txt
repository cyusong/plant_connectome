['19434422', 'Although several glycine-rich protein (GRP) genes were isolated and  characterized, very little is known about their function. The primary structure  of AtGRP5 from Arabidopsis thaliana has a signal peptide followed by a region  with high glycine content. In this work, green fluorescent protein fusions were  obtained in order to characterize the sub-cellular localization of the AtGRP5  protein. The results indicated that this protein is the first described vacuolar  GRP. Sense, antisense and RNAi transgenic A. thaliana plants were generated and  analyzed phenotypically. Plants overexpressing AtGRP5 showed longer roots and an  enhanced elongation of the inflorescence axis, while antisense and RNAi plants  demonstrated the opposite phenotype. The analysis of a knockout T-DNA line  corroborates the phenotypes obtained with the antisense and RNAi plants.  Altogether, these results suggest that this vacuolar GRP could be involved in  organ growth by promoting cell elongation processes.', '2009 Jul', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-009-0940-4', 'Sachetto-Martins']
