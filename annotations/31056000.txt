<i>ADH1</i> (alcohol dehydrogenase 1) was involved in plant growth and development and responded to various stresses. We published a cold-induced alcohol dehydrogenase 1 gene from <i>C. bungeana, CbADH1</i>, which exists 43 unique amino acids. Here, we confirmed that overexpression of <i>CbADH1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and tobacco significantly improved cold shock tolerance through electrolyte leakage, semi-lethal temperature, phenotypic and survival analysis. These results indicate that CbADH1 is the candidate gene to improve the ability of plant freezing resistance, and it has great application value.
