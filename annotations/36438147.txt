For studying land plant evolution, the establishment and optimization of model organisms representing streptophytic algae, sister to land plants, is essential. Long-term cultivation experiments with <i>Chara braunii</i> S276 were performed over 8 years, since 4 years (Nov. 2018) under constant conditions. Additionally, short-term experiments for optimization of culture conditions were performed with three strains of <i>C. braunii</i> (S276, NIES-1604 and Lausiger Teiche, LaT-2708). Germination success after application of sterilization agents, addition of gibberellic acid and under different incubation conditions with respect to pre-treatment, irradiance regime and substrate was investigated in order to develop protocols for generative cultivation of at least unialgal cultures. The resulting cultivation protocols for <i>C. braunii</i> S276, allowing maintenance of vegetative as well as generative cultures are presented in detail, including protocols for germination induction and growth of sterilized and unsterilized oospores.
