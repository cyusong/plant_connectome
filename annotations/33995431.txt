The purification of hydroxycinnamic acids [<i>p</i>-coumaric acid (<i>p</i>CA) and ferulic acid (FA)] from grass cell walls requires high-cost processes. Feedstocks with increased levels of one hydroxycinnamate in preference to the other are therefore highly desirable. We identified and conducted expression analysis for nine BAHD acyltransferase <i>ScAts</i> genes from sugarcane. The high conservation of AT10 proteins, together with their similar gene expression patterns, supported a similar role in distinct grasses. Overexpression of <i>ScAT10</i> in maize resulted in up to 75% increase in total <i>p</i>CA content. Mild hydrolysis and derivatization followed by reductive cleavage (DFRC) analysis showed that <i>p</i>CA increase was restricted to the hemicellulosic portion of the cell wall. Furthermore, total FA content was reduced up to 88%, resulting in a 10-fold increase in the <i>p</i>CA/FA ratio. Thus, we functionally characterized a sugarcane gene involved in <i>p</i>CA content on hemicelluloses and generated a C4 plant that is promising for valorizing <i>p</i>CA production in biorefineries.
