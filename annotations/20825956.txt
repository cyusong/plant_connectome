['20825956', "The catabolism of cytokinins is a vital component of hormonal regulation,  contributing to the control of active forms of cytokinins and their cellular  distribution. The enzyme catalyzing the irreversible cleavage of N(6)-side chains  from cytokinins is a flavoprotein classified as cytokinin dehydrogenase (CKX, EC  1.5.99.12). CKXs also show low cytokinin oxidase activity, but molecular oxygen  is a comparatively poor electron acceptor. The CKX gene family of Arabidopsis  thaliana comprises seven members. Four code for proteins secreted to the  apoplast, the remainder are not secreted. Two are targeted to the vacuoles and  one is restricted to the cytosol. This study presents the purification and  characterization of each of these non-secreted CKX enzymes and substrate  specificities are discussed with respect to their compartmentation. Vacuolar  enzymes AtCKX1 and AtCKX3 were produced in Pichia pastoris and cytosolic enzyme  AtCKX7 was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins were purified  by column chromatography. All enzymes preferred synthetic electron acceptors over  oxygen, namely potassium ferricyanide and 2,3-dimetoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone  (Q(0)). In slightly acidic conditions (pH 5.0), N(6)-(2-isopentenyl)adenine  9-glucoside (iP9G) was the best substrate for AtCKX1 and AtCKX7, whereas AtCKX3  preferentially degraded N(6)-(2-isopentenyl)adenine 9-riboside-5'-monophosphate  (iPMP). Moreover, vacuolar AtCKX enzymes in certain conditions degraded  N(6)-(2-isopentenyl)adenine di- and triphosphates two to five times more  effectively than its monophosphate.", '2010 Dec', 'Phytochemistry', '10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.08.013', 'Frebort']
