Heat stress causes huge losses in the yield of cereal crops. Temperature influences the rate of plant metabolic and developmental processes that ultimately determine the production of grains, with high temperatures causing a reduction in grain yield and quality. To ensure continued food security, the tolerance of high temperature is rapidly becoming necessary. Brassinosteroids (BR) are a class of plant hormones that impact tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses and regulate cereal growth and fertility. Fine-tuning the action of BR has the potential to increase cereals' tolerance and acclimation to heat stress and maintain yields. Mechanistically, exogenous applications of BR protect yields through amplifying responses to heat stress and rescuing the expression of growth promoters. Varied BR compounds and differential signaling mechanisms across cereals point to a diversity of mechanisms that can be leveraged to mitigate heat stress. Further, hormone transport and BR interaction with other molecules in plants may be critical to utilizing BR as protective agrochemicals against heat stress. Understanding the interplay between heat stress responses, growth processes and hormone signaling may lead us to a comprehensive dogma of how to tune BR application for optimizing cereal growth under challenging environments in the field.
