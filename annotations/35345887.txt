Chloroplasts serve as cold priming hubs modulating the transcriptional response of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to a second cold stimulus for several days by postcold accumulation of thylakoid ascorbate peroxidases (tAPX). In an attempt to investigate cross-priming effects of cold on plant pathogen protection, we show here that such a single 24-h cold treatment at 4°C decreased the susceptibility of <i>Arabidopsis</i> to virulent <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 but did not alter resistance against the avirulent <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato avRPM1</i> and <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato avrRPS4</i> strains or the effector-deficient <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> strain <i>hrcC</i><b><i><sup>-</sup></i></b>. The effect of cold priming against <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> was active immediately after cold exposure and memorized for at least 5 days. The priming benefit was established independent of the immune regulator Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 (EDS1) or activation of the immune-related genes <i>NHL10</i>, <i>FRK1</i>, <i>ICS1</i> and <i>PR1</i> but required thylakoid-bound as well as stromal ascorbate peroxidase activities because the effect was absent or weak in corresponding knock-out-lines. Suppression of <i>tAPX</i> postcold regulation in a conditional-inducible <i>tAPX-RNAi</i> line led to increased bacterial growth numbers. This highlights that the plant immune system benefits from postcold regeneration of the protective chloroplast peroxidase system.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
