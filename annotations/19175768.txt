COP1 and COP9 signalosome (CSN) are key regulators of plant light responses and development. Deficiency in either COP1 or CSN causes a constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype. Through coordinated actions of nuclear- and cytoplasmic-localization signals, COP1 can respond to light signals by differentially partitions between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Previous genetic analysis in Arabidopsis indicated that the nuclear localization of COP1 requires CSN, an eight-subunit heteromeric complex. However the mechanism underlying the functional relationship between COP1 and CSN is unknown. We report here that COP1 weakly associates with CSN in vivo. Furthermore, we report on the direct interaction involving the coiled-coil domain of COP1 and the N-terminal domain of the CSN1 subunit. In onion epidermal cells, expression of CSN1 can stimulate nuclear localization of GUS-COP1, and the N-terminal domain of CSN1 is necessary and sufficient for this function. Moreover, CSN1-induced COP1 nuclear localization requires the nuclear-localization sequences of COP1, as well as its coiled-coil domain, which contains both the cytoplasmic localization sequences and the CSN1 interacting domain. We also provide genetic evidence that the CSN1 N-terminal domain is specifically required for COP1 nuclear localization in Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells. This study advances our understanding of COP1 localization, and the molecular interactions between COP1 and CSN.
