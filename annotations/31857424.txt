Plasma membranes provide a highly selective environment for a large number of transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins. Whereas lateral movement of proteins in this lipid bilayer is possible, it is rather limited in turgid and cell wall-shielded plant cells. However, membrane-resident signaling processes occur on subsecond scales that cannot be explained by simple diffusion models. Accordingly, several receptors and other membrane-associated proteins are organized and functional in membrane nanodomains. Although the general presence of membrane nanodomains has become widely accepted as fact, fundamental functional aspects, the roles of individual lipid species and their interplay with proteins, and aspects of nanodomain maintenance and persistence remain poorly understood. Here, we review the current knowledge of nanodomain organization and function, with a particular focus on signaling processes involving proteins, lipids, and their interactions. Furthermore, we propose new and hypothetical aspects of plant membrane biology that we consider important for future research.
