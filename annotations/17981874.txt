The fatty acid oxygenation up-regulated 2 (fou2) mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana creates a gain-of-function allele in a non-selective cation channel encoded by the Two Pore Channel 1 (TPC1) gene. This mutant genetically implicates cation fluxes in the control of the positive feedback loop whereby jasmonic acid (JA) stimulates its own synthesis. In this study we observed extensive transcriptome reprogramming in healthy fou2 leaves closely resembling that induced by treatment with methyl jasmonate, biotic stresses and the potassium starvation response. Proteomic analysis of fou2 leaves identified increased levels of seven biotic stress- and JA-inducible proteins. In agreement with these analyses, epistasis studies performed by crossing fou2 with aos indicated that elevated levels of JA in fou2 are the major determinant of the mutant phenotype. In addition, generation of fou2 aba1-5, fou2 etr1-1 and fou2 npr1-1 double mutants showed that the fou2 phenotype was only weakly affected by ABA levels and unaffected by mutations in NPR1 and ETR1. The results now suggest possible mechanisms whereby fou2 could induce JA synthesis/signaling early in the wound response. In contrast to fou2, transcriptome analysis of a loss-of-function allele of TPC1, tpc1-2, revealed no differential expression of JA biosynthesis genes in resting leaves. However, the analysis disclosed reduced mRNA levels of the pathogenesis-related genes PDF1.2a and THI2.1 in healthy and diseased tpc1-2 leaves. The results suggest that wild-type TPC1 contributes to their expression by mechanisms somewhat different from those affecting their expression in fou2.
