['12750343', "Although it is well established that plant seeds treated with high doses of gamma  radiation arrest development as seedlings, the cause of this arrest is unknown.  The uvh1 mutant of Arabidopsis is defective in a homolog of the human repair  endonuclease XPF, and uvh1 mutants are sensitive to both the toxic effects of UV  and the cytostatic effects of gamma radiation. Here we find that gamma  irradiation of uvh1 plants specifically triggers a G(2)-phase cell cycle arrest.  Mutants, termed suppressor of gamma (sog), that suppress this radiation-induced  arrest and proceed through the cell cycle unimpeded were recovered in the uvh1  background; the resulting irradiated plants are genetically unstable. The sog  mutations fall into two complementation groups. They are second-site suppressors  of the uvh1 mutant's sensitivity to gamma radiation but do not affect the  susceptibility of the plant to UV radiation. In addition to rendering the plants  resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of gamma radiation, the sog1 mutation  affects the proper development of the pollen tetrad, suggesting that SOG1 might  also play a role in the regulation of cell cycle progression during meiosis.", '2003 May', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/164.1.323', 'Britt']
