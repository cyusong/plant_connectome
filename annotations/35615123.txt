Asian cultivated rice consists of two main subspecies, <i>xian</i>/<i>indica</i> (XI) and <i>geng</i>/<i>japonica</i> (GJ), and GJ accessions have significantly lower nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) than XI accessions. In order to facilitate genetic improvement of NUE in GJ accessions, we conducted haplotype analysis of 14 cloned NUE genes using 36 rice germplasm accessions with high-quality reference genome and developed 18 intragenic markers for elite haplotypes, which were then used to evaluate NUE genes in another 41 genetically diverse germplasm accessions from 12 countries and 71 approved GJ cultivars from northern provinces of China. Our results show that elite haplotypes of 12 NUE genes are mainly existed in XI accessions, but few is distributed in GJ accessions. The number of elite haplotypes carried by an XI accession can reach 10, while that carried by a GJ accession is less than 3. Surprisingly, the elite haplotype of gene <i>DEP1</i> is nearly fixed in approved GJ cultivars, and elite haplotypes of gene <i>MYB61</i> and <i>NGR5</i> have been introduced into some approved GJ cultivars. The developed intragenic markers for NUE genes and evaluated 77 genetically diverse rice accessions could be of great use in the improvement of NUE in GJ cultivars.

XI accessions: !carry! elite haplotypes of 12 NUE genes 
GJ accessions: !carry! fewer than 3 elite haplotypes 
DEP1 gene: !nearly fixed in! approved GJ cultivars 
MYB61 gene: !introduced into! some approved GJ cultivars 
NGR5 gene: !introduced into! some approved GJ cultivars
