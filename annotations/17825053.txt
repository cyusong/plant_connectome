Both indole acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellins (GAs) stimulate cell and organ growth. We have examined GA/IAA cross-talk in cambial growth of hybrid aspen (Populus tremulaxtremuloides). Decapitated trees were fed with IAA and GA, alone and in combination. Endogenous hormone levels after feeding were measured, by mass spectrometry, in the stem tissues below the point of application. These stem tissues with defined hormone balances were also used for global transcriptome analysis, and the abundance of selected transcripts was measured by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. By feeding isotope-labeled IAA, we demonstrated that GA increases auxin levels in the stem by stimulating polar auxin transport. This finding adds a new dimension to the concept that the endogenous GA/IAA balance in plants is determined by cross-talk between the two hormones. We also show that GA has a common transcriptome with auxin, including many transcripts related to cell growth. This finding provides molecular support to physiological experiments demonstrating that either hormone can induce growth if the other hormone is absent/deficient because of mutations or experimental treatments. It also highlights the potential for extensive cross-talk between GA- and auxin-induced responses in vegetative growth of the intact plant. The role of endogenous IAA and GA in wood development is discussed.
