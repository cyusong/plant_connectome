Many conifers have distributions that span wide ranges in both biotic and abiotic conditions, but the basis of response to biotic stress has received much less attention than response to abiotic stress. In this study, we investigated the gene expression response of lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i>) to attack by the fungal pathogen <i>Dothistroma septosporum</i>, which causes Dothistroma needle blight, a disease that has caused severe climate-related outbreaks in northwestern British Columbia. We inoculated tolerant and susceptible pines with two <i>D. septosporum</i> isolates and analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differential exon usage, and coexpressed gene modules using RNA-sequencing data. We found a rapid and strong transcriptomic response in tolerant lodgepole pine samples inoculated with one <i>D. septosporum</i> isolate, and a late and weak response in susceptible samples inoculated with another isolate. We mapped 43 of the DEG- or gene module-identified genes to the reference plant-pathogen interaction pathway deposited in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. These genes are present in PAMP-triggered and effector-triggered immunity pathways. Genes comprising pathways and gene modules had signatures of strong selective constraint, while the highly expressed genes in tolerant samples appear to have been favored by selection to counterattack the pathogen. We identified candidate resistance genes that may respond to <i>D. septosporum</i> effectors. Taken together, our results show that gene expression response to <i>D. septosporum</i> infection in lodgepole pine varies both among tree genotypes and pathogen strains and involves both known candidate genes and a number of genes with previously unknown functions.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
