The contradiction between "high yielding" and "early maturing" hampers further improvement of annual rice yield. Here we report the positional cloning of a major maturity duration regulatory gene, <i>Early flowering-completely dominant</i> (<i>Ef-cd</i>), and demonstrate that natural variation in <i>Ef-cd</i> could be used to overcome the above contradictory. The <i>Ef-cd</i> locus gives rise to a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) antisense transcript overlapping the <i>OsSOC1</i> gene. <i>Ef-cd</i> lncRNA expression positively correlates with the expression of <i>OsSOC1</i> and H3K36me3 deposition. Field test comparisons of early maturing <i>Ef-cd</i> near-isogenic lines with their wild types as well as of the derivative early maturing hybrids with their wild-type hybrids conducted under different latitudes determined that the early maturing <i>Ef-cd</i> allele shortens maturity duration (ranging from 7 to 20 d) without a concomitant yield penalty. <i>Ef-cd</i> facilitates nitrogen utilization and also improves the photosynthesis rate. Analysis of 1,439 elite hybrid rice varieties revealed that the 16 homozygotes and 299 heterozygotes possessing <i>Ef-cd</i> matured significantly earlier. Therefore, <i>Ef-cd</i> could be a vital contributor of elite early maturing hybrid varieties in balancing grain yield with maturity duration.
