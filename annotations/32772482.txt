Acer truncatum (purpleblow maple) is a woody tree species that produces seeds with high levels of valuable fatty acids (especially nervonic acid). However, the lack of a complete genome sequence has limited both basic and applied research on A. truncatum. We describe a high-quality draft genome assembly comprising 633.28 Mb (contig N50 = 773.17 kb; scaffold N50 = 46.36 Mb) with at least 28 438 predicted genes. The genome underwent an ancient triplication, similar to the core eudicots, but there have been no recent whole-genome duplication events. Acer yangbiense and A. truncatum are estimated to have diverged about 9.4 million years ago. A combined genomic, transcriptomic, metabonomic, and cell ultrastructural analysis provided new insights into the biosynthesis of very long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids. In addition, three KCS genes were found that may contribute to regulating nervonic acid biosynthesis. The KCS paralogous gene family expanded to 28 members, with 10 genes clustered together and distributed in the 0.27-Mb region of pseudochromosome 4. Our chromosome-scale genomic characterization may facilitate the discovery of agronomically important genes and stimulate functional genetic research on A. truncatum. Furthermore, the data presented also offer important foundations from which to study the molecular mechanisms influencing the production of nervonic acids.
