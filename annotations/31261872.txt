Most commercial cultivars of lily are sensitive to abiotic stresses. However, tiger lily (<i>Lilium lancifolium</i> L.), one of the most widely distributed wild lilies in Asia, has strong abiotic stresses resistance. Thus, it is indispensable to identify stress-responsive candidate genes in tiger lily for the stress resistance improvement of plants. In this study, a MYB related homolog (LlMYB3) from tiger lily was functionally characterized as a positive regulator in plant stress tolerance. LlMYB3 is a nuclear protein with transcriptional activation activity at C-terminus. The expression of <i>LlMYB3</i> gene was induced by multiple stress treatments. Several stress-related cis-acting regulatory elements (MYBRS, MYCRS, LTRE and DRE/CRT) were located within the promoter of <i>LlMYB3</i>; however, the promoter activity was not induced sufficiently by various stresses treatments. Overexpressing <i>LlMYB3</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> L. transgenic plants showed ABA hypersensitivity and enhanced tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stresses. Furthermore, we found <i>LlMYB3</i> highly co-expressed with <i>LlCHS2</i> gene under cold treatment; yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays demonstrated LlMYB3 was able to bind to the promoter of <i>LlCHS2</i>. These findings suggest that the stress-responsive LlMYB3 may be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway to regulate stress tolerance of tiger lily.
