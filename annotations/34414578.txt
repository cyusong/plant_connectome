Strigolactones (SLs) are plant hormones that modulate morphological, physiological and biochemical changes as part of the acclimation strategies to phosphorus (P) deficiency, but an in-depth description of their effects on tomato P-acquisition strategies under P shortage is missing. Therefore, in this study, we investigate how SLs impact on root exudation and P uptake, in qualitative and quantitative terms over time, in wild-type and SL-depleted tomato plants grown with or without P. Under P shortage, SL-depleted plants were unable to efficiently activate most mechanisms associated with the P starvation response (PSR), except for the up-regulation of P transporters and increased activity of P-solubilizing enzymes. The reduced SL biosynthesis had negative effects also under normal P provision, because plants over-activated high-affinity transporters and enzymatic activities (phytase, acidic phosphatase) to sustain elevated P uptake, at great carbon and nitrogen costs. A shift in the onset of PSR was also highlighted in these plants. We conclude that SLs are master kinetic regulators of the PSR in tomato and that their defective synthesis might lead both to suboptimal nutritional outcomes under P depletion and an unbalanced control of P uptake when P is available.
