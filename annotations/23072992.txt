Mediator is a conserved eukaryotic multiprotein complex required by RNA polymerase II for transcription of its target genes. Till date, there is no report explaining the signals that affect the overall concentration of individual Med subunits. In this report, we have analyzed the effect of different phytohormones and stresses on the transcript level of Med genes in Arabidopsis. Hormones like auxin and JA, and cold stress did not show significant effect. ABA moderately increased the transcript abundance of more than 70% of AtMed genes analyzed in this study. However, there was noticeable change in the transcript level of several AtMed genes in response to BR. Stresses like high light, dark and salt also caused significant change in the transcript abundance of many AtMed genes. These data reveal that different environmental cues can affect stoichiometric concentration of Med subunits by affecting the transcription of their respective genes. This may, in turn, affect the overall arrangement of functional Mediator complex. This also suggests that some subunits may have some specific functions to play in response different signals.
