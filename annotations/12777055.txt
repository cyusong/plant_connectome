['12777055', 'A promoter-trap screen allowed us to identify an Arabidopsis line expressing GUS  in the root vascular tissues. T-DNA border sequencing showed that the line was  mutated in the caffeic acid O-methyltransferase 1 gene (AtOMT1) and therefore  deficient in OMT1 activity. Atomt1 is a knockout mutant and the expression  profile of the AtOMT1 gene has been determined as well as the consequences of the  mutation on lignins, on soluble phenolics, on cell wall digestibility, and on the  expression of the genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis. In this mutant and  relative to the wild type, lignins lack syringyl (S) units and contain more  5-hydroxyguaiacyl units (5-OH-G), the precursors of S-units. The sinapoyl ester  pool is modified with a two-fold reduction of sinapoyl-malate in the leaves and  stems of mature plants as well as in seedlings. In addition, LC-MS analysis of  the soluble phenolics extracted from the seedlings reveals the occurrence of  unusual derivatives assigned to 5-OH-feruloyl malate and to 5-OH-feruloyl  glucose. Therefore, AtOMT1 enzymatic activity appears to be involved not only in  lignin formation but also in the biosynthesis of sinapate esters. In addition, a  deregulation of other monolignol biosynthetic gene expression can be observed in  the Atomt1 mutant. A poplar cDNA encoding a caffeic acid OMT (PtOMT1) was  successfully used to complement the Atomt1 mutant and restored both the level of  S units and of sinapate esters to the control level. However, the over-expression  of PtOMT1 in wild-type Arabidopsis did not increase the S-lignin content,  suggesting that OMT is not a limiting enzyme for S-unit biosynthesis.', '2003 Apr', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1023022825098', 'Jouanin']
