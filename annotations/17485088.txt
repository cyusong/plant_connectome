['17485088', 'Plants possess two different types of phosphofructokinases, an ATP-dependent  (PFK) and a pyrophosphate-dependent form (PFP). While plant PFPs have been  investigated in detail, cDNA clones coding for PFK have not been identified in  Arabidopsis thaliana. Searching the A. thaliana genome revealed 11 putative  members of a phosphofructokinase gene family. Among those, four sequences showed  high homology to the alpha- or beta-subunits of plant PFPs. Seven cDNAs resulted  in elevated PFK, but not PFP activity after transient expression in tobacco  leaves suggesting that they encode Arabidopsis PFKs. RT-PCR revealed different  tissue-specific expression of the individual forms. Furthermore, analysis of GFP  fusion proteins indicated their presence in different sub-cellular compartments.', '2007 May 29', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2007.04.060', 'Biemelt']
