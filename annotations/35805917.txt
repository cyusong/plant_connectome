Due to their sessile state, plants are inevitably affected by and respond to the external environment. So far, plants have developed multiple adaptation and regulation strategies to abiotic stresses. One such system is epigenetic regulation, among which DNA methylation is one of the earliest and most studied regulatory mechanisms, which can regulate genome functioning and induce plant resistance and adaption to abiotic stresses. In this review, we outline the most recent findings on plant DNA methylation responses to drought, high temperature, cold, salt, and heavy metal stresses. In addition, we discuss stress memory regulated by DNA methylation, both in a transient way and the long-term memory that could pass to next generations. To sum up, the present review furnishes an updated account of DNA methylation in plant responses and adaptations to abiotic stresses.
