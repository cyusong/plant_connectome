['16326926', 'Transcription in plastids is mediated by a plastid-encoded multimeric (PEP) and a  nuclear-encoded single-subunit RNA polymerase (NEP) and a still unknown number of  nuclear-encoded factors. By combining gel filtration and affinity chromatography  purification steps, we isolated transcriptionally active chromosomes from  Arabidopsis thaliana and mustard (Sinapis alba) chloroplasts and identified 35  components by electrospray ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometry. Eighteen  components, called plastid transcriptionally active chromosome proteins (pTACs),  have not yet been described. T-DNA insertions in three corresponding genes,  ptac2, -6, and -12, are lethal without exogenous carbon sources. Expression  patterns of the plastid-encoded genes in the corresponding knockout lines  resemble those of Deltarpo mutants. For instance, expression of plastid genes  with PEP promoters is downregulated, while expression of genes with NEP promoters  is either not affected or upregulated in the mutants. All three components might  also be involved in posttranscriptional processes, such as RNA processing and/or  mRNA stability. Thus, pTAC2, -6, and -12 are clearly involved in plastid gene  expression.', '2006 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.036392', 'Oelmuller']
