Fusarium seedling blight (FSB) is an important disease of wheat occurring as part of the Fusarium disease complex consisting also of Fusarium head blight (FHB). 240 Chinese elite cultivars and lines were evaluated in greenhouse experiments for FSB resistance and genotyped using the wheat 90 K single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Among them, 23 accessions had an average lesion length of less than 0.6 cm, exhibiting potential for breeding for FSB resistance in wheat. Jingfumai 1 and Yangmai 11 had a relatively high resistance to both FSB and FHB simultaneously. Six relatively stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected on chromosome arms 1DL, 3AS, 3BL, 6BL, 7AL, and Un using the mixed linear model approach, interpreting 4.83-7.53% of phenotypic variation. There was a negative correlation between the average FSB lesion length and the BLUE FHB index with a low coefficient, and resistance to both diseases appeared to be conferred by different QTLs across the same population. Four KASP markers were detected on 1DL, 3AS, 3BL, and 6BL in QTLs to facilitate marker-assisted selection. Combined with transcriptome data analysis, eight defense-related genes were considered as candidates for mapping QTLs. The resistant elite germplasm, mapped QTLs, and KASP markers developed in this study are useful resources for enhancing Fusarium seedling blight in wheat breeding.
