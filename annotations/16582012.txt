['16582012', 'Receptors for acid hydrolases destined for the lytic compartment in yeast and  mammalian cells are retrieved from intermediate, endosomal organelles with the  help of a pentameric protein complex called the retromer. We cloned the  Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of the three yeast proteins (Vps35, Vps29, and  Vps26) constituting the larger subunit of retromer and prepared antisera against  them. With these antibodies, we demonstrated the presence of a retromer-like  protein complex in salt extracts prepared from Arabidopsis microsomes. This  complex is associated with membranes that coequilibrate with prevacuolar  compartment markers and with high-density sedimenting membranes. Immunogold  negative staining identified these membranes as 90-nm-diameter coated  microvesicles. Confocal laser scanning immunofluorescence studies performed on  tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cells revealed high degrees of colabeling  between all three retromer antisera and the prevacuolar compartment (PVC) markers  PEP12 and vacuolar sorting receptor VSR(At-1). The presence of plant retromer at  the surface of multivesicular bodies was also demonstrated by immunogold labeling  of sections obtained from high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted specimens.  Treatment of BY-2 cells with wortmannin led to swelling of the PVC and a  separation of the VPS35 and VSR signals. Preliminary data suggesting that  retromer interacts with the cytosolic domain of a VSR were obtained by  immunoprecipitation experiments performed on detergent-solubilized microsomes  with Vps35 antibodies.', '2006 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.035907', 'Robinson']
