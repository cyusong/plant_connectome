Crucial studies have verified that IAA is mainly generated via the two-step pathway in Arabidopsis, in which tryptophan aminotransferase (TAA) and YUCCA (YUC) are the two crucial enzymes. However, the role of the <i>TAA</i> (or <i>TAR</i>) and <i>YUC</i> genes in allotetraploid oilseed rape underlying auxin biosynthesis and development regulation remains elusive. In the present study, all putative <i>TAR</i> and <i>YUC</i> genes were identified in <i>B. napus</i> genome. Most <i>TAR</i> and <i>YUC</i> genes were tissue that were specifically expressed. Most YUC and TAR proteins contained trans-membrane regions and were confirmed to be endoplasmic reticulum localizations. Enzymatic activity revealed that YUC and TAR protein members were involved in the conversion of IPA to IAA and Trp to IPA, respectively. Transgenic plants overexpressing <i>BnaYUC6a</i> in both <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>B. napus</i> displayed high auxin production and reduced plant branch angle, together with increased drought resistance. Moreover, mutation in auxin biosynthesis <i>BnaTARs</i> genes by CRISPR/Cas9 caused development defects. All these results suggest the convergent role of <i>BnaYUC</i> and <i>BnaTAR</i> genes in auxin biosynthesis. Different homoeologs of <i>BnaYUC</i> and <i>BnaTAR</i> may be divergent according to sequence and expression variation. Auxin biosynthesis genes in allotetraploid oilseed rape play a pivotal role in coordinating plant development processes and stress resistance.
