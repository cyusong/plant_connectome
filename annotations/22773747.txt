['22773747', 'Meristems retain the ability to divide throughout the life cycle of plants, which  can last for over 1000 years in some species. Furthermore, the germline is not  laid down early during embryogenesis but originates from the meristematic cells  relatively late during development. Thus, accurate cell cycle regulation is of  utmost importance to avoid the accumulation of mutations during vegetative growth  and reproduction. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes two homologs of the  replication licensing factor CDC10 Target1 (CDT1), and overexpression of CDT1a  stimulates DNA replication. Here, we have investigated the respective functions  of Arabidopsis CDT1a and CDT1b. We show that CDT1 proteins have partially  redundant functions during gametophyte development and are required for the  maintenance of genome integrity. Furthermore, CDT1-RNAi plants show endogenous  DNA stress, are more tolerant than the wild type to DNA-damaging agents, and show  constitutive induction of genes involved in DNA repair. This DNA stress response  may be a direct consequence of reduced CDT1 accumulation on DNA repair or may  relate to the ability of CDT1 proteins to form complexes with DNA polymerase epsilon,  which functions in DNA replication and in DNA stress checkpoint activation. Taken  together, our results provide evidence for a crucial role of Arabidopsis CDT1  proteins in genome stability.', '2012 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.100156', 'Raynaud']
