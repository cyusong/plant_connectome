Reactive oxygen species (ROS) represent both toxic by-products of aerobic metabolism as well as signaling molecules in processes like growth regulation and defense pathways. The study of signaling and oxidative-damage effects can be separated in plants expressing glycolate oxidase in the plastids (GO plants), where the production of H(2)O(2) in the chloroplasts is inducible and sustained perturbations can reproducibly be provoked by exposing the plants to different ambient conditions. Thus, GO plants represent an ideal non-invasive model to study events related to the perception and responses to H(2)O(2) accumulation. Metabolic profiling of GO plants indicated that under high light a sustained production of H(2)O(2) imposes coordinate changes on central metabolic pathways. The overall metabolic scenario is consistent with decreased carbon assimilation, which results in lower abundance of glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, while simultaneously amino acid metabolism routes are specifically modulated. The GO plants, although retarded in growth and flowering, can complete their life cycle indicating that the reconfiguration of the central metabolic pathways is part of a response to survive and thus, to adapt to stress conditions imposed by the accumulation of H(2)O(2) during the light period.
