['23511208', "Circadian clocks exhibit 'temperature compensation', meaning that they show only  small changes in period over a broad temperature range. Several clock genes have  been implicated in the temperature-dependent control of period in Arabidopsis. We  show that blue light is essential for this, suggesting that the effects of light  and temperature interact or converge upon common targets in the circadian clock.  Our data demonstrate that two cryptochrome photoreceptors differentially control  circadian period and sustain rhythmicity across the physiological temperature  range. In order to test the hypothesis that the targets of light regulation are  sufficient to mediate temperature compensation, we constructed a  temperature-compensated clock model by adding passive temperature effects into  only the light-sensitive processes in the model. Remarkably, this model was not  only capable of full temperature compensation and consistent with mRNA profiles  across a temperature range, but also predicted the temperature-dependent change  in the level of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL, a key clock protein. Our analysis  provides a systems-level understanding of period control in the plant circadian  oscillator.", '2013', 'Mol Syst Biol', '10.1038/msb.2013.7', 'Hall']
