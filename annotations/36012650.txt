The clustering of transgenes at a chromosome location minimizes the number of segregating loci that needs to be introgressed to field cultivars. Transgenes could be efficiently stacked through site-specific recombination and a recombinase-mediated in planta gene stacking process was described previously in tobacco based on the Mycobacteriophage Bxb1 site-specific integration system. Since this process requires a recombination site in the genome, this work describes the generation of target sites in the <i>Japonica</i> rice genome. <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated gene transfer yielded ~4000 random-insertion lines. Seven lines met the criteria of being single copy, not close to a centromere, not inserted within or close to a known gene or repetitive DNA, having precise recombination site sequences on both ends, and able to express the reporter gene. Each target line tested was able to accept the site-specific integration of a new <i>gfp</i>-containing plasmid and in three of those lines, we regenerated fertile plants. These target lines could be used as foundation lines for stacking new traits into <i>Japonica</i> rice.
