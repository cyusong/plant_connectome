Diatoms are photosynthetic microalgae that fix a significant fraction of the world's carbon. Because of their photosynthetic efficiency and high-lipid content, diatoms are priority candidates for biofuel production. Here, we report that sporulating Bacillus thuringiensis and other members of the Bacillus cereus group, when in co-culture with the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, significantly increase diatom cell count. Bioassay-guided purification of the mother cell lysate of B. thuringiensis led to the identification of two diketopiperazines (DKPs) that stimulate both P. tricornutum growth and increase its lipid content. These findings may be exploited to enhance P. tricornutum growth and microalgae-based biofuel production. As increasing numbers of DKPs are isolated from marine microbes, the work gives potential clues to bacterial-produced growth factors for marine microalgae.

Bacillus thuringiensis: !increases! Phaeodactylum tricornutum cell count
DKPs: !stimulate! P. tricornutum growth
DKPs: !increase! P. tricornutum lipid content
Bacterial-produced growth factors: !potentially enhance! marine microalgae growth
