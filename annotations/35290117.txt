Communication between interacting organisms via bioactive molecules is widespread in nature and plays key roles in diverse biological processes. Small RNAs (sRNAs) can travel between host plants and filamentous pathogens to trigger transkingdom RNA interference (RNAi) in recipient cells and modulate plant defense and pathogen virulence. However, how fungal pathogens counteract transkingdom antifungal RNAi has rarely been reported. Here we show that a secretory protein VdSSR1 (secretory silencing repressor 1) from Verticillium dahliae, a soil-borne phytopathogenic fungus that causes wilt diseases in a wide range of plant hosts, is required for fungal virulence in plants. VdSSR1 can translocate to plant nucleus and serve as a general suppressor of sRNA nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. We further reveal that VdSSR1 sequesters ALY family proteins, adaptors of the TREX complex, to interfere with nuclear export of the AGO1–microRNA (AGO1–miRNA) complex, leading to a great attenuation in cytoplasmic AGO1 protein and sRNA levels. With this mechanism, V. dahliae can suppress the accumulation of mobile plant miRNAs in fungal cells and succedent transkingdom silencing of virulence genes, thereby increasing its virulence in plants. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which phytopathogenic fungi antagonize antifungal RNAi-dependent plant immunity and expand the understanding on the complex interaction between host and filamentous pathogens.
