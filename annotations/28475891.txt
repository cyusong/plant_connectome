The phytobiome is composed of plants, their environment, and diverse interacting microscopic and macroscopic organisms, which together influence plant health and productivity. These organisms form complex networks that are established and regulated through nutrient cycling, competition, antagonism, and chemical communication mediated by a diverse array of signaling molecules. Integration of knowledge of signaling mechanisms with that of phytobiome members and their networks will lead to a new understanding of the fate and significance of these signals at the ecosystem level. Such an understanding could lead to new biological, chemical, and breeding strategies to improve crop health and productivity.
