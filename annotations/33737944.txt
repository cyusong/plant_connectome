Plant glycoproteins display a characteristic type of <i>O</i>-glycosylation where short arabinans or larger arabinogalactans are linked to hydroxyproline. The conversion of proline to 4-hydroxyproline is accomplished by prolyl-hydroxylases (P4Hs). Eleven putative <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> P4Hs, which fall in four homology groups, have been identified by homology searches using known <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> P4H sequences. One member of each of these groups has been expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and applied to synthetic peptides representing the <i>O</i>-glycosylated region of erythropoietin (EPO), IgA1, Art v 1 and the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> glycoprotein STRUBBELIG. Unlike the situation in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>, where one particular P4H was mainly responsible for the oxidation of erythropoietin, the tobacco P4Hs exhibited rather similar activities, albeit with biased substrate preferences and preferred sites of oxidation. From a biotechnological viewpoint, this result means that silencing/knockout of a single <i>P4H</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i> cannot be expected to result in the abolishment of the plant-specific oxidation of prolyl residues in a recombinant protein.
