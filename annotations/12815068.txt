['12815068', 'Shoot branching is inhibited by auxin transported down the stem from the shoot  apex. Auxin does not accumulate in inhibited buds and so must act indirectly. We  show that mutations in the MAX4 gene of Arabidopsis result in increased and  auxin-resistant bud growth. Increased branching in max4 shoots is restored to  wild type by grafting to wild-type rootstocks, suggesting that MAX4 is required  to produce a mobile branch-inhibiting signal, acting downstream of auxin. A  similar role has been proposed for the pea gene, RMS1. Accordingly, MAX4 and RMS1  were found to encode orthologous, auxin-inducible members of the polyene  dioxygenase family.', '2003 Jun 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.256603', 'Leyser']
