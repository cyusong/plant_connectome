Slow canopy wilting (SW) is a water conservation trait controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in late maturity group soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Recently, two exotic (landraces) plant introductions (PI 567690 and PI 567731) were identified as new SW lines in early maturity groups. Here, we show that the two PIs share the same water conservation strategy of limited maximum transpiration rates as PI 416937. However, in contrast to PI 416937, the transpiration rates of these PIs were sensitive to an aquaporin inhibitor, indicating an independence between limited maximum transpiration and the lack of silver-sensitive aquaporins. Yield tests of selected recombinant inbred lines from two elite/exotic crosses provide direct evidence to support the benefit of SW in drought tolerance. Four SW QTLs mapped in a Pana×PI 567690 cross at multiple environments were found to be co-located with previous reports. Moreover, two new SW QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 6 and 10 from a Magellan×PI 567731 cross. These two QTLs explain the observed relatively large contributions of 20-30% and were confirmed in a near-isogenic background. These findings demonstrate the importance of SW in yield protection under drought and provide genetic resources for improving drought tolerance in early maturity group soybeans.
