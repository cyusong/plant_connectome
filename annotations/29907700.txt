['29907700', 'Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which consist of receptor kinases (RKs) and  receptor-like proteins, sense microbe- and host-derived molecular patterns  associated with pathogen infection to trigger immune responses in plants. Several  kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) receptor-like  cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered  immunity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act specifically  or redundantly in immune signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order  mutants of this subfamily (named rlck vii-1 to rlck vii-9) and systematically  characterized their immune phenotypes. The mutants rlck vii-5, -7, and -8 had  compromised reactive oxygen species production in response to all patterns  tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the  signaling of multiple PRRs. However, rlck vii-4 was defective specifically in  chitin-induced reactive oxygen species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4  members mediate the signaling of specific PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members  were required for the chitin-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that  these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6  and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results  show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered immune  signaling and uncover both common and specific roles of these kinases in plant  development and immunity mediated by various RKs.', '2018 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.18.00486', 'ORCID:']
