Salinized soil is a major environmental stress affecting plant growth and development. Excessive salt in the soil inhibits the growth of most plants and even threatens their survival. Halophytes are plants that can grow and develop normally on saline-alkali soil due to salt tolerance mechanisms that emerged during evolution. For this reason, halophytes are used as pioneer plants for improving and utilizing saline land. Tamarisk, a family of woody halophytes, is highly salt tolerant and has high economic value. Understanding the mechanisms of salt tolerance in tamarisk and identifying the key genes involved are important for improving saline land and increasing the salt tolerance of crops. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the salt tolerance mechanisms of tamarisk and the economic and medicinal value of this halophyte.
