Using a field to lab approach, mature deep-rooting traits in wheat were correlated to root phenotypes measured on young plants from controlled conditions. Mature deep-rooting root traits of 20 wheat genotypes at maturity were established via coring in three field trials across 2 years. Field traits were correlated to phenotypes expressed by the 20 genotypes after growth in four commonly used lab screens: (i) soil tubes for root emergence, elongation, length, and branching at four ages to 34 days after sowing (DAS); (ii) paper pouches 7 DAS and (iii) agar chambers for primary root (PR) number and angles at 8 DAS; and (iv) soil baskets for PR and nodal root (NR) number and angle at 42 DAS. Correlations between lab and field root traits (r2=0.45-0.73) were highly inconsistent, with many traits uncorrelated and no one lab phenotype correlating similarly across three field experiments. Phenotypes most positively associated with deep field roots were: longest PR and NR axiles from the soil tube screen at 20 DAS; and narrow PR angle and wide NR angle from soil baskets at 42 DAS. Paper and agar PR angles were positively and significantly correlated to each other, but only wide outer PRs in the paper screen correlated positively to shallower field root traits. NR phenotypes in soil baskets were not predicted by PR phenotypes in any screen, suggesting independent developmental controls and value in measuring both root types in lab screens. Strong temporal and edaphic effects on mature root traits, and a lack of understanding of root trait changes during plant development, are major challenges in creating controlled-environment root screens for mature root traits in the field.
