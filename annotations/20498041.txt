['20498041', 'An imbalance in photosynthetic electron transfer is thought to be redressed by  photosynthetic control of the rate of expression of genes encoding apoproteins of  photosystem (PS)-I and PS-II in response to the redox state of plastoquinone  (PQ), which is a connecting electron carrier. PS stoichiometry is then adjusted  to enhance photosynthetic efficiency. In prokaryotes, sigma factors are well  known for their participation in the control of RNA polymerase activity in  transcription, whereas there have been no reports concerning their association  with redox regulation. We have found that the phosphorylation of SIG1, the major  sigma factor (SIG), is regulated by redox signals and selectively inhibits the  transcription of the psaA gene, which encodes a PS-I protein. We produced  transgenic Arabidopsis plants with or without the putative phosphorylation sites  for SIG1 and demonstrated through in vivo labeling that Thr-170 was involved in  the phosphorylation. We analyzed the in vivo and in vitro transcriptional  responses of the transgenic Arabidopsis plants to the redox status in regard to  involvement of the phosphorylation site. We revealed an enhanced phosphorylation  of SIG1 under oxidative conditions of PQ in a form associated with the molecular  mass of the holoenzyme. Phosphorylation of SIG1 proved crucial through a change  in the promoter specificity for sustaining balanced expression of components in  PS-I and PS-II and was responsible for harmonious electron flow to maintain  photosynthetic efficiency.', '2010 Jun 8', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0911692107', 'Kobayashi']
