['30003611', 'SnRK1 is a protein kinase complex that is involved in several aspects of plant  growth and development. There are published data indicative of a participation of  SnRK1 in the regulation of the synthesis and degradation of starch, although the  molecular mechanism is not known. In this work, we performed electron microscopy  to explore the in vivo localization of the regulatory and catalytic subunits that  constitute the SnRK1 complex. The results indicated that all the subunits are  present in the chloroplast and, in particular, the SnRK1 betagamma and SnRK1 beta3 subunits  are associated with starch. Furthermore, the regulatory subunits bind maltose, a  relevant product of starch degradation. The kinase activity of immunoprecipitated  complexes containing the betagamma regulatory subunit was positively regulated by  maltose only in the complexes obtained from Arabidopsis leaves collected at dusk.  Recombinant complexes with the SnRK1alpha1 catalytic subunit, SnRK1betagamma and three  different beta subunits showed that maltose only had an effect on a complex formed  with the beta3 subunit. Truncation of the CBM domain form SnRK1 betagamma abolished the  maltose activation of the complex and the activity was significantly reduced,  indicating that the CBM is a positive regulator of SnRK1. A model of the  SnRK1alpha1/betagamma/beta3 complex suggests the presence of two putative maltose-binding  sites, both involving ligand interactions with the betagamma subunit and the alpha subunit.', '2018 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14026', 'Coello']
