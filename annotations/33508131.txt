Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development. Low inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability is a limiting factor for plant growth and yield. To cope with a complex and changing environment, plants have evolved elaborate mechanisms for regulating Pi uptake and use. Recently, the molecular mechanisms of plant Pi signaling have become clearer. Plants absorb Pi from the soil through their roots and transfer Pi to various organs or tissues through phosphate transporters, which are precisely controlled at the transcript and protein levels. Here, we summarize recent progress on the molecular regulatory mechanism of phosphate transporters in Arabidopsis and rice, including the characterization of functional transporters, regulation of transcript levels, protein localization and turnover of phosphate transporters. A more in-depth understanding of plant adaptation to a changing Pi environment will facilitate the genetic improvement of plant P efficiency.
