An in vitro method of multiple shoot induction and plant regeneration in Psophocarpus tetragonolobus (L.) DC was developed. Cotyledons, hypocotyls, epicotyls, internodal and young seedling leaves were used as explants. MS media supplemented with various concentrations of either thidiazuron (TDZ) or N6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) along with NAA or IAA combinations were used to determine their influence on multiple shoot induction. MS media supplemented with TDZ induced direct shoot regeneration when epicotyls and internodal segments were used as explants. TDZ at 3 mg L(-1) induced highest rate (89.2 ± 3.28%) of regeneration with (13.4 ± 2.04) shoots per explant. MS media supplemented with BAP in combination with NAA or IAA induced callus mediated regeneration when cotyledons and hypocotyls were used as explants. BAP (2.5 mg L(-1)) and IAA (0.2 mg L(-1)) induced highest rate (100 ± 2.66%) of regeneration with (23.2 ± 2.66) shoots per explant. Mature plants produced from regenerated shoots were transferred successfully to the greenhouse. In a comparative study, the phenolics contents of various parts of greenhouse-grown plants with that of in vitro-raised plants showed significant variations.
