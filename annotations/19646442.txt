['19646442', 'The dual-targeted mitochondrial and chloroplastic zinc metallooligopeptidase from  Arabidopsis, AtPreP, functions as a peptidasome that degrades targeting peptides  and other small unstructured peptides. In addition to Zn located in the catalytic  site, AtPreP also contains two Mg-binding sites. We have investigated the role of  Mg-binding using AtPreP variants, in which one or both sites were rendered unable  to bind Mg(2+). Our results show that metal binding besides that of the active  site is crucial for AtPreP proteolysis, particularly the inner site appears  essential for normal proteolytic function. This is also supported by its  evolutionary conservation among all plant species of PreP.', '2009 Sep 3', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2009.07.040', 'Glaser']
