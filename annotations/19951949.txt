['19951949', 'Plants induce immune responses against fungal pathogens by recognition of chitin,  which is a component of the fungal cell wall. Recent studies have revealed that  LysM receptor-like kinase 1/chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (LysM RLK1/CERK1)  is a critical component for the immune responses to chitin in Arabidopsis  thaliana. However, the molecular mechanism of the chitin recognition by LysM RLK1  still remains unknown. Here, we present the first evidence for direct binding of  LysM RLK1 to chitin. We expressed LysM RLK1 fused with yeast-enhanced green  fluorescent protein (LysM RLK1-yEGFP) in yeast cells. Binding studies using the  solubilized LysM RLK1-yEGFP and several insoluble polysaccharides having similar  structures showed that LysM RLK1-yEGFP specifically binds to chitin.  Subsequently, the fluorescence microscopic observation of the solubilized LysM  RLK1-yEGFP binding to chitin beads revealed that the binding was saturable and  had a high affinity, with a K(d) of approximately 82 nm. This binding was  competed by the addition of soluble glycol chitin or high concentration of chitin  oligosaccharides having 4-8 residues of N-acetyl glucosamine. However, the  competition of these chitin oligosaccharides is weaker than that of glycol  chitin. These data suggest that LysM RLK1 has a higher affinity for chitin having  a longer residue of N-acetyl glucosamine. We also found that LysM RLK1-yEGFP was  autophosphorylated in vitro and that chitin does not affect the phosphorylation  of LysM RLK1-yEGFP. Our results provide a new dimension to chitin elicitor  perception in plants.', '2010 Jan 29', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M109.027540', 'Nagano']
