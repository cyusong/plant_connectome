['21115662', 'Eukaryotic cells expand using vesicle traffic to increase membrane surface area.  Expansion in walled eukaryotes is driven by turgor pressure which depends  fundamentally on the uptake and accumulation of inorganic ions. Thus, ion uptake  and vesicle traffic must be controlled coordinately for growth. How this  coordination is achieved is still poorly understood, yet is so elemental to life  that resolving the underlying mechanisms will have profound implications for our  understanding of cell proliferation, development, and pathogenesis, and will find  applications in addressing the mineral and water use by plants in the face of  global environmental change. Recent discoveries of interactions between  trafficking and ion transport proteins now open the door to an entirely new  approach to understanding this coordination. Some of the advances to date in  identifying key protein partners in the model plant Arabidopsis and in yeast at  membranes vital for cell volume and turgor control are outlined here.  Additionally, new evidence is provided of a wider participation among Arabidopsis  Kv-like K(+) channels in selective interaction with the vesicle-trafficking  protein SYP121. These advances suggest some common paradigms that will help guide  further exploration of the underlying connection between ion transport and  membrane traffic and should transform our understanding of cellular homeostasis  in eukaryotes.', '2011 Apr', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erq386', 'Grefen']
