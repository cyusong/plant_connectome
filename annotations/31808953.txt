The suspensor is a short-lived tissue critical for proper embryonic development in many higher plants. While the tissue was initially thought to simply suspend the embryo in the endosperm, it has been found through decades of research that it serves multiple important purposes. The suspensor has been found to be vital for proper embryo patterning and numerous studies have been undertaken into the complex transcriptional cross-talk between the suspensor and the embryo proper. Indeed, many suspensor mutants also display abnormalities in the embryo. The suspensor's role as a nutrient conduit has been shown using ultrastructural and histochemical techniques. Biochemical approaches have found that the suspensor is a centre of early embryonic hormone production in several species. The suspensor has also been frequently used as a model for programmed cell death as it shows signs of termination almost immediately upon developing. This review covers the essential functions of the suspensor throughout its short existence from multiple disciplines including structural, genetic and biochemical perspectives.
