Phosphorus (P) is an essential but often over-applied nutrient in agricultural systems. Because of its detrimental environmental effects, P fertilization is well studied in crop production. Controlled environment agriculture allows for precise control of root-zone P and has the potential to improve sustainability over field agriculture. Medical <i>Cannabis</i> is uniquely cultivated for the unfertilized female inflorescence and mineral nutrition can affect the yield and chemical composition of these flowers. P typically accumulates in seeds, but its partitioning in unfertilized <i>Cannabis</i> flowers is not well studied. Here we report the effect of increasing P (25, 50, and 75 mg P per L) in continuous liquid fertilizer on flower yield, cannabinoid concentration, leachate P, nutrient partitioning, and phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) of a high-CBD <i>Cannabis</i> variety. There was no significant effect of P concentration on flower yield or cannabinoid concentration, but there were significant differences in leachate P, nutrient partitioning, and PUE. Leachate P increased 12-fold in response to the 3-fold increase in P input. The P concentration in the unfertilized flowers increased to more than 1%, but this did not increase yield or quality. The fraction of P in the flowers increased from 25 to 65% and PUE increased from 31 to 80% as the as the P input decreased from 75 to 25 mg per L. Avoiding excessive P fertilization can decrease the environmental impact of <i>Cannabis</i> cultivation.
