['27449211', 'Boron (B) is essential for plants but toxic in excess. The borate efflux  transporter BOR1 is expressed in various root cells and localized to the  inner/stele-side domain of the plasma membrane (PM) under low-B conditions. BOR1  is rapidly degraded through endocytosis upon sufficient B supply. The polar  localization and degradation of BOR1 are considered important for efficient B  translocation and avoidance of B toxicity, respectively. In this study, we first  analyzed the subcellular localization of BOR1 in roots, cotyledons and  hypocotyls, and revealed a polar localization in various cell types. We also  found that the inner polarity of BOR1 is established after completion of  cytokinesis in the root meristem. Moreover, variable-angle epifluorescence  microscopy visualized BOR1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) as particles in the PM  with significant lateral movements but in restricted areas. Importantly, a  portion of BOR1-GFP particles co-localized with DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 1A  (DRP1A), which is involved in scission of the clathrin-coated vesicles, and they  disappeared together from the PM. To examine the contribution of DRP1A-mediated  endocytosis to BOR1 localization and degradation, we developed an inducible  expression system of the DRP1A K47A variant. The DRP1A variant prolonged the  residence time of clathrin on the PM and inhibited endocytosis of membrane  lipids. The dominant-negative DRP1A blocked endocytosis of BOR1 and disturbed its  polar localization and B-induced degradation. Our results provided insight into  the endocytic mechanisms that modulate the subcellular localization and abundance  of a mineral transporter for nutrient homeostasis in plant cells.', '2016 Sep', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcw121', 'Takano']
