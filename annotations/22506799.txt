Ferrous iron toxicity is a mineral disorder frequently occurring under waterlogged soils where rice is cultivated. To decipher the main metabolic pathways involved in rice response to iron excess, seedlings have been exposed to 125 mg L(-1) FeSO(4) for 3 weeks. A combined transcriptomic, biochemical and physiological study has been performed after short-term (3 d) or long-term (3 weeks) exposure to iron in order to elucidate the strategy of stress adaptation with time. Our results showed that short- and long-term exposure involved a very different response in gene expression regarding both the number and function. A larger number of genes were up- or down-regulated after 3 d than after 3 weeks of iron treatment; these changes also occurred in shoot even though no significant difference in iron concentration was recorded. Those modifications in gene expression after 3 d affected not only genes involved in hormonal signalling but also genes involved in C-compound and carbohydrate metabolism, oxygen and electron transfer, oxidative stress, and iron homeostasis and transport. Modification in some gene expression can be followed by modification in corresponding metabolic products and physiological properties, or differed in time for some others, underlying the importance of an integrated study.
