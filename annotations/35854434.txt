The phloem is a key player in whole plant functioning-transporting carbon from sites of production to sites of demand-and is likely influenced by drought due to its dependence on water for generating pressure-driven bulk flow transport. Yet, phloem functioning during drought remains largely unknown due to a lack of experimental studies. Here, we use a phloem-bleeding species, Ricinus communis, to investigate phloem loss-of-function in the context of leaf physiological processes, the mechanisms of phloem turgor maintenance during drought, and the role of turgor in phloem loss-of-function. We found that the solute concentration in the phloem sap doubled over the drought, which allowed phloem turgor to be maintained past the point at which leaves have reached permanent stomatal closure. We also found that phloem turgor did not decline before bleeding ceased, which suggests that phloem bleeding ceassation (interpreted as the cessation of transport) occurred when the phloem still had turgor. In sum, our findings highlight the robustness of phloem functioning, with important implications for forecasting whole-plant carbon dynamics and drought-induced tree mortality.

Ricinus communis: !maintains turgor during! drought
solute concentration: !doubles in! phloem sap
phloem turgor: !does not decline before! bleeding ceases
phloem functioning: !remains robust during! drought
