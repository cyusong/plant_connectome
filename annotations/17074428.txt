['17074428', "In a previous work, we presented evidence for the presence of a protein encoded  by At5g50600 in oil bodies (OBs) from Arabidopsis thaliana [P. Jolivet, E. Roux,  S. D'Andrea, M. Davanture, L. Negroni, M. Zivy, T. Chardot, Protein composition  of oil bodies in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype WS, Plant Physiol. Biochem. 42  (2004) 501-509]. Using specific antibodies and proteomic techniques, we presently  confirm the existence of this protein, which is a member of the short-chain  steroid dehydrogenase reductase superfamily. We have measured its activity toward  various steroids (cholesterol, dehydroepiandrosterone, cortisol, corticosterone,  estradiol, estrone) and NAD(P)(H), either within purified OBs or as a purified  bacterially expressed chimera. Both enzymatic systems (OBs purified from A.  thaliana seeds as well as the chimeric enzyme) exhibited hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase (HSD) activity toward estradiol (17beta-hydroxysteroid) with NAD+  or NADP+, NADP+ being the preferred cofactor. Low levels of activity were  observed with cortisol or corticosterone (11beta-hydroxysteroids), but neither  cholesterol nor DHEA (3beta-hydroxysteroids) were substrates, whatever the  cofactor used. Similar activity profiles were found for both enzyme sources.  Purified OBs were found to be also able to catalyze estrone reduction  (17beta-ketosteroid reductase activity) with NADPH. The enzyme occurring in A.  thaliana OBs can be classified as a NADP+-dependent 11beta-,17beta-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase/17beta-ketosteroid reductase. This enzyme probably corresponds to  AtHSD1, which is encoded by At5g50600. However, its physiological role and  substrates still remain to be determined.", '2007 Feb', 'Biochimie', '10.1016/j.biochi.2006.09.013', 'Chardot']
