Cytokinesis in plants requires the activity of RAB GTPases to regulate vesicle-mediated contribution of material to the developing cell plate. While some plant RAB GTPases have been shown to be involved in cell plate formation, many still await functional assignment. Here, we report cell plate localization for YFP-RABA1e in Arabidopsis thaliana and use the cytokinesis inhibitor Endosidin 7 to provide a detailed description of its localization compared to YFP-RABA2a. Differences between YFP-RABA2a and YFP-RABA1e were observed in late-stage cell plates under DMSO control treatment, and became more apparent under Endosidin 7 treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that individual RAB GTPases might make different contributions to cell plate formation and further demonstrates the utility of ES7 probe to dissect them.

RAB GTPases: !regulate! Vesicle-mediated contribution
YFP-RABA1e: !localizes to! Cell plate
YFP-RABA2a: !localizes to! Cell plate
YFP-RABA2a: !differs from! YFP-RABA1e
Endosidin 7: !dissects! Individual RAB GTPases
