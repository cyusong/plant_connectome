Sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) in the far-red region provides a new noninvasive measurement approach that has the potential to quantify dynamic changes in light-use efficiency and gross primary production (GPP). However, the mechanistic link between GPP and SIF is not completely understood. We analyzed the structural and functional factors controlling the emission of SIF at 760 nm (F<sub>760</sub> ) in a Mediterranean grassland manipulated with nutrient addition of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) or nitrogen-phosphorous (NP). Using the soil-canopy observation of photosynthesis and energy (SCOPE) model, we investigated how nutrient-induced changes in canopy structure (i.e. changes in plant forms abundance that influence leaf inclination distribution function, LIDF) and functional traits (e.g. N content in dry mass of leaves, N%, Chlorophyll a+b concentration (Cab) and maximum carboxylation capacity (V<sub>cmax</sub> )) affected the observed linear relationship between F<sub>760</sub> and GPP. We conclude that the addition of nutrients imposed a change in the abundance of different plant forms and biochemistry of the canopy that controls F<sub>760</sub> . Changes in canopy structure mainly control the GPP-F<sub>760</sub> relationship, with a secondary effect of Cab and V<sub>cmax</sub> . In order to exploit F<sub>760</sub> data to model GPP at the global/regional scale, canopy structural variability, biodiversity and functional traits are important factors that have to be considered.
