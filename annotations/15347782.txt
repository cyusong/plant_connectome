['15347782', 'Physicochemical similarities between K(+) and Na(+) result in interactions  between their homeostatic mechanisms. The physiological interactions between  these two ions was investigated by examining aspects of K(+) nutrition in the  Arabidopsis salt overly sensitive (sos) mutants, and salt sensitivity in the K(+)  transport mutants akt1 (Arabidopsis K(+) transporter) and skor (shaker-like K(+)  outward-rectifying channel). The K(+)-uptake ability (membrane permeability) of  the sos mutant root cells measured electrophysiologically was normal in control  conditions. Also, growth rates of these mutants in Na(+)-free media displayed  wild-type K(+) dependence. However, mild salt stress (50 mm NaCl) strongly  inhibited root-cell K(+) permeability and growth rate in K(+)-limiting conditions  of sos1 but not wild-type plants. Increasing K(+) availability partially rescued  the sos1 growth phenotype. Therefore, it appears that in the presence of Na(+),  the SOS1 Na(+)-H(+) antiporter is necessary for protecting the K(+) permeability  on which growth depends. The hypothesis that the elevated cytoplasmic Na(+)  levels predicted to result from loss of SOS1 function impaired the K(+)  permeability was tested by introducing 10 mm NaCl into the cytoplasm of a  patch-clamped wild-type root cell. Complete loss of AKT1 K(+) channel activity  ensued. AKT1 is apparently a target of salt stress in sos1 plants, resulting in  poor growth due to impaired K(+) uptake. Complementary studies showed that akt1  seedlings were salt sensitive during early seedling development, but skor  seedlings were normal. Thus, the effect of Na(+) on K(+) transport is probably  more important at the uptake stage than at the xylem loading stage.', '2004 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.049213', 'Spalding']
