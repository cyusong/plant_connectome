* Guard cell movements are regulated by environmental cues including, for example, elevations in extracellular Ca(2+) concentration. Here, the subcellular localization and physiological function of the Ca(2+)-sensing receptor (CAS) protein was investigated. * CAS protein localization was ascertained by microscopic analyses of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins and biochemical fractionation assays. Comparative guard cell movement investigations were performed in wild-type and cas loss-of-function mutant lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. Cytoplasmic Ca(2+) dynamics were addressed in plants expressing the yellow cameleon reporter protein YC3.6. * This study identified CAS as a chloroplast-localized protein that is crucial for proper stomatal regulation in response to elevations of external Ca(2+). CAS fulfils this role through modulation of the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration. * This work reveals a novel role of the chloroplast in cellular Ca(2+) signal transduction.
