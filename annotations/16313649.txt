The influence of external nitrogen (N) on carbon (C) allocation and processes related to phosphorus (P) metabolism were studied in monoxenic arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) cultures of Daucus carota. Fungal hyphae of Glomus intraradices proliferated from colonized roots growing on solid medium into C-free liquid minimal medium with two different N and P levels. Furthermore, we exposed the colonized roots to high or low N availability and then studied the mycelial development. Roots were provided with (13)C-glucose in order to follow the C allocation. The mycelium was analysed for phosphatase activity and transcription levels of two nutrient regulated genes. High N availability to the monoxenic AM root reduced the C allocation to the AM fungus while N availability to the mycelium was important for the upregulation of the fungal inorganic phosphorus (Pi)-transporter GiPT. We found that N availability can regulate nutritional processes in arbuscular mycorrhiza. We conclude that negative impacts of N on AM abundance are caused by reduced C allocation from the plant. Upregulation of the fungal Pi-transporter GiPT indicated that increased N availability might induce P limitation in the mycelium.
