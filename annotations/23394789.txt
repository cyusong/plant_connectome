Heat is a primary abiotic stress that reduces crop yields. At the seedling stage, we identified heat-sensitive mutants that carried T-DNA inserted into a heat shock protein 70 gene, OsHsp70CP1. When grown under a constant high temperature (40°C), the seedling leaves developed severe chlorosis whereas plants grown at a constant 27°C showed a normal phenotype. This indicated that OsHsp70CP1 is essential for chloroplast differentiation from the proplastids under high temperatures. Transient expression analyses revealed that OsHsp70CP1 was localized to the stroma. OsHsp70CP1 was dominantly expressed in photosynthetic tissues; transcripts were greatly increased by heat stress. Some transcripts for plastid RNA metabolism were impaired in the mutant while others were not, demonstrating that a subset of nuclear-encoded proteins are substrates of OsHsp70CP1.
