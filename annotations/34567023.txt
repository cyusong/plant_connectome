Chloroplast biogenesis and development are highly complex processes requiring interactions between plastids and nuclear genomic products. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins play an essential role in the development of chloroplasts; however, it remains unclear how RNA editing factors influence soybean development. In this study, a <i>Glycine max pale green leaf 2</i> mutant (<i>Gmpgl2</i>) was identified with decreased chlorophyll contents. Genetic mapping revealed that a single-nucleotide deletion at position 1949 bp in the <i>Glyma.05g132700</i> gene in the <i>Gmpgl2</i> mutant, resulting in a truncated GmPGL2 protein. The nuclear-encoded <i>GmPGL2</i> is a PLS-type PPR protein that localizes to the chloroplasts. The C-to-U editing efficiencies of <i>rps16</i>, <i>rps18</i>, <i>ndhB</i>, <i>ndhD</i>, <i>ndhE</i>, and <i>ndhF</i> were reduced in the <i>Gmpgl2</i> mutant. RNA electrophoresis mobility shift assay (REMSA) analysis further revealed that GmPGL2 binds to the immediate upstream sequences at RNA editing sites of <i>rps16</i> and <i>ndhB in vitro</i>, respectively. In addition, GmPGL2 was found to interact with GmMORF8, GmMORF9, and GmORRM6. These results suggest that GmPGL2 participates in C-to-U RNA editing <i>via</i> the formation of a complex RNA editosome in soybean chloroplasts.
