Plant lateral roots (LRs) play vital roles in anchorage and uptake of water and nutrients. Here, we reveal that degradation of lariat intronic RNAs (lariRNAs) modulated by SICKLE (SIC) is required for LR development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Loss of SIC results in hyper-accumulation of lariRNAs and restricts the outgrowth of LR primordia, thereby reducing the number of emerged LRs. Decreasing accumulation of lariRNAs by over-expressing RNA debranching enzyme 1 (DBR1), a rate-limiting enzyme of lariRNA decay, restored LR defects in SIC-deficient plants. Mechanistically, SIC interacts with DBR1 and facilitates its nuclear accumulation, which is achieved through two functionally redundant regions (SIC1-244 and SIC252-319) for nuclear localization. Of the remaining amino acids in this region, six (SIC245-251) comprise a DBR1-interacting region while two (SICM246 and SICW251) are essential for DBR1-SIC interaction. Reducing lariRNAs restored microRNA (miRNA) levels and LR development in lariRNA hyper-accumulating plants, suggesting that these well-known regulators of LR development mainly function downstream of lariRNAs. Taken together, we propose that SIC acts as an enhancer of DBR1 nuclear accumulation by driving nuclear localization through direct interaction, thereby promoting lariRNA decay to fine-tune miRNA biogenesis and modulating LR development.
