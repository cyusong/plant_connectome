['25656510', 'UV radiation is a ubiquitous component of solar radiation that affects plant  growth and development. Here we studied growth related traits of 345 Arabidopsis  thaliana accessions in response to UV radiation stress. We analyzed the genetic  basis of this natural variation by genome-wide association studies, which  suggested a specific candidate genomic region. RNA-sequencing of three sensitive  and three resistant accessions combined with mutant analysis revealed five large  effect genes. Mutations in PHE ammonia lyase 1 (PAL1) and putative kinase  At1g76360 rendered Arabidopsis hypersensitive to UV stress, while loss of  function from putative methyltransferase At4g22530, novel plant snare 12 (NPSN12)  and defense gene activated disease resistance 2 (ADR2) conferred higher UV stress  resistance. Three sensitive accessions showed strong ADR2 transcriptional  activation, accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and dwarf growth upon UV stress,  while these phenotypes were much less affected in resistant plants. The phenotype  of sensitive accessions resembles autoimmune reactions due to overexpression of  defense related genes, and suggests that natural variation in response to UV  radiation stress is driven by pathogen-like responses in Arabidopsis.', '2015 Aug', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2015.01.011', 'Pecinka']
