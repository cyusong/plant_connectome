Sorghum, the fifth largest cereal crop, has high value as a staple food and raw material for liquor and vinegar brewing. Due to its high biomass and quality, it is also used as the second most planted silage resource. No fragrant sorghums are currently on the market. Through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of SbBADH2, we obtained sorghum lines with extraordinary aromatic smell in both seeds and leaves. Animal feeding experiments showed that fragrant sorghum leaves were attractable. We believe this advantage will produce great value in the sorghum market for both grain and whole biomass forage.
