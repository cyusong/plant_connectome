Elements are important functional traits reflecting plant response to climate change. Multiple elements work jointly in plant physiology. Although a large number of studies have focused on the variation and allocation of multiple elements in plants, it remains unclear how these elements co-vary to adapt to environmental change. We proposed a novel concept of the multi-element network including the mutual effects between element concentrations to more effectively explore the alterations in response to long-term nitrogen (N) deposition. Leaf multi-element networks were constructed with 18 elements (i.e., six macronutrients, six micronutrients, and six trace elements) in this study. Multi-element networks were species-specific, being effectively discriminated irrespective of N deposition level. Different sensitive elements and interactions to N addition were found in different species, mainly concentrating on N, Ca, Mg, Mn, Li, Sr, Ba, and their related stoichiometry. Interestingly, high plasticity of multi-element network increased or maintained relative aboveground biomass (species dominance) in community under simulated N deposition, which developed the multi-element network hypothesis. In summary, multi-element networks provide a novel approach for exploring the adaptation strategies of plants and to better predict the change of species dominance under altering nutrient availability or environmental stress associated with future global climate change.
