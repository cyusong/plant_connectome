Squamosa promoter binding protein (SBP)-box genes are plant-specific transcription factors involved in plant growth and development, morphogenesis and biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, these genes have been understudied in pepper, especially with respect to defense responses to <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> infection. <i>CaSBP11</i> is a SBP-box family gene in pepper that was identified in our previous research. Silencing <i>CaSBP11</i> enhanced the defense response of pepper plants to <i>Phytophthora capsici</i>. Without treatment, the expression of defense-related genes (<i>CaBPR1</i>, <i>CaPO1</i>, <i>CaSAR8.2</i> and <i>CaDEF1</i>) increased in <i>CaSBP11</i>-silenced plants. However, the expression levels of these genes were inhibited under transient <i>CaSBP11</i> expression. <i>CaSBP11</i> overexpression in transgenic <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> decreased defense responses, while in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, it induced or inhibited the expression of genes in the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling pathways. <i>CaSBP11</i> overexpression in <i>sid2-2</i> mutants induced <i>AtNPR1</i>, <i>AtNPR3</i>, <i>AtNPR4</i>, <i>AtPAD4</i>, <i>AtEDS1</i>, <i>AtEDS5</i>, <i>AtMPK4</i> and <i>AtNDR1</i> expression, while <i>AtSARD1</i> and <i>AtTGA6</i> expression was inhibited. <i>CaSBP11</i> overexpression in <i>coi1-21</i> and <i>coi1-22</i> mutants, respectively, inhibited <i>AtPDF1.2</i> expression and induced <i>AtPR1</i> expression. These results indicate <i>CaSBP11</i> has a negative regulatory effect on defense responses to <i>Phytophthora capsici</i>. Moreover, it may participate in the defense response of pepper to <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> by regulating defense-related genes and the salicylic and jasmonic acid-mediated disease resistance signaling pathways.
