Plant High-affinity K+ transporters/K+ uptake permeases/K+ transporters (HAK/KUP/KT) transporters have been predicted as membrane H+-K+ symporters in facilitating K+ uptake and distribution, while their role in seed production remains to be elucidated. In this study, we report that OsHAK26 is preferentially expressed in anthers and seed husks and located in the Golgi apparatus. Knockout of either OsHAK26 or plasma membrane located H+-K+ symporter gene OsHAK1 or OsHAK5 in both Nipponbare and Dongjin cultivars caused distorted anthers, reduced number and germination rate of pollen grains. Seed-setting rate assay by reciprocal cross-pollination between the mutants of oshak26, oshak1, oshak5 and their wild types confirmed that each HAK transporter is foremost for pollen viability, seed-setting and grain yield. Intriguingly, the pollens of oshak26 showed much thinner wall and were more vulnerable to desiccation than those of oshak1 or oshak5. In vitro assay revealed that the pollen germination rate of oshak5 was dramatically affected by external K+ concentration. The results suggest that the role of OsHAK26 in maintaining pollen development and fertility may relate to its proper cargo sorting for construction of pollen walls, while the role of OsHAK1 and OsHAK5 in maintaining seed production likely relates to their transcellular K+ transport activity.
