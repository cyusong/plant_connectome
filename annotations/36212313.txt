Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is the most abundant divalent cation in plants, and cellular levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which functions as a nutrient and secondary messenger, play a critical role in plant immunity. In the present study, we found that FERONIA-like receptor 1 (FLR1) positively regulates <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> resistance and that expression of FLR1 is strongly induced in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> deficiency. In addition, the Ca content in the shoots of <i>flr1</i> was lower than that in wild-type, and the <i>M. oryzae</i>-sensitive phenotype of the <i>flr1</i> mutant was not rescued by exogenous application of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, RNA sequencing revealed 2,697 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the <i>flr1</i> mutant compared with wild-type, and some of these DEGs are involved in cellular metal ion homeostasis and transition metal ion homeostasis. Changes in expression of overlapping genes between the <i>flr1</i> mutant and in plants under low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment were consistent in terms of direction, indicating that FLR1 is involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. In summary, we detected FLR1-mediated resistance to <i>M. oryzae</i>, a phenomenon associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.
