Nuclear lamins are involved in multiple biological processes in metazoan cells. The proteins of the CROWDED NUCLEI (CRWN) family are considered lamin-like candidates in Arabidopsis, although the functions of these proteins are largely unknown. In this article we show that crwn1 crwn2 double mutant displays an enhanced resistance against virulent bacterial pathogens, and both virulent bacteria and salicylic acid (SA) induce transcription of CRWN1 gene as well as proteasome-mediated degradation of CRWN1 protein. We also show that CRWN1 interacts with NAC WITH TRANSMEMBRANE MOTIF1-LIKE9 (NTL9), a NAC transcription factor involved in plant immunity. The interaction between CRWN1 and NTL9 enhances the binding of NTL9 to the promoter of the PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1 (PR1) gene, and inhibits PR1 expression. Further genetic experiments indicated that the defense-related phenotypes of crwn1 crwn2 double mutant are dependent on NONEXPRESSOR OF PR GENES1 (NPR1), a transcriptional cofactor of PR1. These findings revealed a regulatory network composed of lamin-like protein CRWN1, NTL9, and NPR1 for the regulation of PR1 expression.
