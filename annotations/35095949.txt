<i>GPD</i> encodes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme involved in sugar mobilization, particularly glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. The objective of this study was to determine physiological aspects of germination and early seedling establishment of <i>PsGPD</i> (<i>Pleurotus sajor-caju</i> glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) expressing transgenic rice (T5) against different salt concentrations. The T5 line that carried 2 copies of T-DNA and had the highest level of <i>PsGPD</i> expression was used in the investigation. Final germination percentage, amylase activity, reducing sugar accumulation, and chlorophyll biosynthesis were comparatively higher in <i>PsGPD</i> expressing transgenic rice against elevating saline conditions. A slow-paced conversion of porphyrin's precursors was seen through the matrix model and further elaborated by a graphical model. A sustained level of porphyrin was observed in <i>PsGPD</i> expressing transgenic rice. These data were concurrent with the relative gene expression and thermal imaging (thermography) of <i>PsGPD</i> expressing transgenic rice against salt stress. Morphological attributes also favored the salt tolerance exhibited by <i>PsGPD-</i>transformed rice.
