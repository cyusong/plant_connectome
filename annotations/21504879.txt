The RNAi-mediated silencing of Pina and Pinb, the two genes responsible for the grain texture of allohexaploid wheat, was induced and analysed in two wheat cultivars, Kontesa and Torka. A characterization of the two genes in non-transgenic plants revealed that Pinb carries a point mutation, designated Pinb-D1c in both cultivars. This mutation does not influence transcript abundance or protein content. Two silencing cassettes of the hpRNA type were constructed and used for stable transformation via Agrobacterium. In total, 43 transgenic lines representing the two cultivars were obtained, transformed with the silencing cassettes for Pina or for Pinb or co-transformed with both cassettes. The relative transcript levels of the two genes in the same progeny plant were found to be similar, independent of the silencing cassette used. The reduction in the Pina and Pinb transcript levels in the segregating T(1) progeny of Kontesa and Torka transformed with one of the silencing cassettes exceeded 80%. Co-transformation with the silencing cassettes for both genes resulted in a reduction of over 91% of Pina and Pinb transcripts in some segregating T(1) progeny of Kontesa. The silencing was transmitted to the T(4) kernel generation of the T(3) lines. A significant reduction or lack of both puroindoline proteins in the silenced lines correlated with an essential increase in grain hardness. The discussion covers some new insights into the function of the Pin genes, including the simultaneous silencing of both, independent of the siRNA signal.
