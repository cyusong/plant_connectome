Selection of plants with traits that are beneficial for cultivation and consumption has been a common practice for thousands of years; however, combination of these traits can be detrimental too, for instance by leading to undesirable branching and yield loss in tomato. The findings from Soyk et al. in this issue of Cell help understand how to bypass such negative effects and improve crop productivity.
