<i>Japonica</i> rice has become increasingly popular in China owing to its superior grain quality. Over the past decades, "<i>indica</i> to <i>japonica</i>" projects have been proposed to promote cultivation of <i>japonica</i> rice in low latitudes in China. Traditionally, <i>japonica</i> varieties were planted mainly in mid latitudes in the northeast plain and Yangtze River region. The key obstacle for introducing elite mid-latitude <i>japonica</i> varieties to low latitudes is the severe shortening of growth period of the <i>japonica</i> varieties due to their sensitivity to low-latitude short photoperiod and high temperature. Here we report development of new <i>japonica</i> rice with prolonged basic vegetative growth (BVG) periods for low latitudes by targeted editing the <i>Early heading date 1</i> (<i>Ehd1</i>) gene. Using CRISPR/Cas9 system, we generated both frame-shift and/or in-frame deletion mutants in four <i>japonica</i> varieties, Nipponbare, Longdao16, Longdao24, and Xiushui134. When planting at low-latitude stations, the frame-shift homozygous lines exhibited significantly longer BVG periods compared with wild-types. Interestingly, we observed that minor deletion of the first few residues within the receiver domain could quantitatively impair the function of Ehd1 on activation of <i>Hd3a</i> and <i>RFT1</i>, resulting in an intermediate-long BVG period phenotype in the homozygous in-frame deletion <i>ehd1</i> lines. Field investigation further showed that, both the in-frame and frame-shift lines exhibited significantly improved yield potential compared with wild-types. Our study demonstrates an effective approach to rapid breeding of elite <i>japonica</i> varieties with intermediate-long and long BVG periods for flexible cropping systems in diverse areas or under different seasons in southern China, and other low-latitude regions.
