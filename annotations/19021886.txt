Proton motive force (pmf) across thylakoid membranes is not only for harnessing solar energy for photosynthetic CO(2) fixation, but also for triggering feedback regulation of photosystem II antenna. The mechanisms for balancing these two roles of the proton circuit under the long-term environmental stress, such as prolonged drought, have been poorly understood. In this study, we report on the response of wild watermelon thylakoid 'proton circuit' to drought stress using both in vivo spectroscopy and molecular analyses of the representative photosynthetic components. Although drought stress led to enhanced proton flux via a approximately 34% increase in cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (PS I), an observed approximately fivefold decrease in proton conductivity, g(H)(+), across thylakoid membranes suggested that decreased ATP synthase activity was the major factor for sustaining elevated q(E). Western blotting analyses revealed that ATP synthase content decreased significantly, suggesting that quantitative control of the complex plays a pivotal role in down-regulation of g(H)(+). The expression level of cytochrome b(6)f complex - another key control point in photosynthesis - also declined, probably to prevent excess-reduction of PS I electron acceptors. We conclude that plant acclimation to long-term environmental stress involves global changes in the photosynthetic proton circuit, in which ATP synthase represents the key control point for regulating the relationship between electron transfer and pmf.
