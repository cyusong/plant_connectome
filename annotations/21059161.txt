['21059161', 'Prenylated Rab acceptors (PRAs) bind to prenylated Rab proteins and possibly aid  in targeting Rabs to their respective compartments. In Arabidopsis, 19 isoforms  of PRA1 have been identified and, depending upon the isoforms, they localize to  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus and endosomes. Here, we  investigated the localization and trafficking of AtPRA1.B6, an isoform of the  Arabidopsis PRA1 family. In colocalization experiments with various organellar  markers, AtPRA1.B6 tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) at the N-terminus localized to  the Golgi apparatus in protoplasts and transgenic plants. The valine residue at  the C-terminal end and an EEE motif in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain were  critical for anterograde trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The  N-terminal region contained a sequence motif for retention of AtPRA1.B6 at the  Golgi apparatus. In addition, anterograde trafficking of AtPRA1.B6 from the ER to  the Golgi apparatus was highly sensitive to the HA:AtPRA1.B6 level. The region  that contains the sequence motif for Golgi retention also conferred the  abundance-dependent trafficking inhibition. On the basis of these results, we  propose that AtPRA1.B6 localizes to the Golgi apparatus and its ER-to-Golgi  trafficking and localization to the Golgi apparatus are regulated by multiple  sequence motifs in both the C- and N-terminal cytoplasmic domains.', '2011 Feb', 'Traffic', '10.1111/j.1600-0854.2010.01140.x', 'Hwang']
