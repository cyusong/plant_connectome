Information and function of a genome are not only decorated with epigenetic marks in the linear DNA sequence but also in their non-random spatial organization in the nucleus. Recent research has revealed that three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization is highly correlated with the functionality of the genome, contributing to many cellular processes. Driven by the improvements in chromatin conformation capture methods and visualization techniques, the past decade has been an exciting period for the study of plants' 3D genome structures, and our knowledge in this area has been substantially advanced. This Review describes our current understanding of plant chromatin organization and positioning beyond the nucleosomal level, and discusses future directions.
