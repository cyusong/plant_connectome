Bamboo, being an ornamental plant, has myriad aesthetic and economic significance. Particularly, <i>Phyllostachys violascens</i> cv. Viridisulcata contains an internode color phenotype in variation in green and yellow color between the sulcus and culm, respectively. This color variation is unique, but the underlying regulatory mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we used metabolomic and transcriptomic strategies to reveal the underlying mechanism of variation in internode color. A total of 81 metabolites were identified, and among those, prunin as a flavanone and rhoifolin as a flavone were discovered at a high level in the culm. We also found 424 differentially expressed genes and investigated three genes (<i>PvGL</i>, <i>PvUF7GT</i>, and <i>PvC12RT1</i>) that might be involved in prunin or rhoifolin biosynthesis. Their validation by qRT-PCR confirmed high transcript levels in the culm. The results revealed that <i>PvGL</i>, <i>PvUF7GT</i>, and <i>PvC12RT1</i> might promote the accumulation of prunin and rhoifolin which were responsible for the variation in internode color of <i>P. violascens</i>. Our study also provides a glimpse into phenotypic coloration and is also a valuable resource for future studies.

PvGL: !promotes! prunin accumulation
PvUF7GT: !promotes! prunin accumulation
PvC12RT1: !promotes! prunin accumulation
prunin: !responsible for! internode color variation
rhoifolin: !responsible for! internode color variation
