The FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs) represent the largest family of nematode neuropeptides and are involved in multiple parasitic activities. The immunoreactivity to FMRFamide within the nervous system of <i>Heterodera glycines</i>, the most economically damaging parasite of soybean [<i>Glycine max</i> L. (Merr)], has been reported in previous research. However, the family of genes encoding FLPs of <i>H. glycines</i> were not identified and functionally characterized. In this study, an FLP encoding gene <i>Hg-flp-22</i> was cloned from <i>H. glycines</i>, and its functional characterization was uncovered by using <i>in vitro</i> RNA interference and application of synthetic peptides. Bioinformatics analysis showed that <i>flp-22</i> is widely expressed in multiple nematode species, where they encode the highly conserved KWMRFamide motifs. Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR results revealed that <i>Hg-flp-22</i> was highly expressed in the infective second-stage juveniles (J2s) and adult males. Silencing of <i>Hg-flp-22</i> resulted in the reduced movement of J2s to the host root and reduced penetration ability, as well as a reduction in their subsequent number of females. Behavior and infection assays demonstrated that application of synthetic peptides Hg-FLP-22b (TPQGKWMRFa) and Hg-FLP-22c (KMAIEGGKWVRFa) significantly increased the head movement frequency and host invasion abilities in <i>H. glycines</i> but not in <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>. In addition, the number of <i>H. glycines</i> females on the host roots was found to be significantly higher in Hg-FLP-22b treated nematodes than the ddH<sub>2</sub>O-treated control J2s. These results presented in this study elucidated that <i>Hg-flp-22</i> plays a role in regulating locomotion and infection of <i>H. glycines</i>. This suggests the potential of FLP signaling as putative control targets for <i>H. glycines</i> in soybean production.
