Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is an important regulatory enzyme situated at a key branch point of central plant metabolism. Plant genomes encode several plant-type PEPC (PTPC) isozymes, along with a distantly related bacterial-type PEPC (BTPC). BTPC is expressed at high levels in developing castor oil seeds where it tightly interacts with co-expressed PTPC polypeptides to form unusual hetero-octameric Class-2 PEPC complexes that are desensitized to allosteric inhibition by L-malate. Analysis of RNA-Seq and microarray transcriptome datasets revealed two distinct patterns of tissue-specific BTPC expression in vascular plants. Species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, strawberry, rice, maize, and poplar mainly exhibited pollen- or floral-specific BTPC expression. By contrast, BTPC transcripts were relatively abundant in developing castor, cotton, and soybean seeds, cassava tubers, as well as immature tomato, cucumber, grape, and avocado fruit. Immunoreactive 118 kDa BTPC polypeptides were detected on immunoblots of cucumber and tomato fruit extracts. Co-immunoprecipitation established that as in castor, BTPCs physically interact with endogenous PTPCs to form Class-2 PEPC complexes in tomato and cucumber fruit. We hypothesize that Class-2 PEPCs simultaneously maintain rapid anaplerotic PEP carboxylation and respiratory CO2 refixation in diverse, biosynthetically active sinks that accumulate high malate levels.
