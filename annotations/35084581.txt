The relationship of fructan to plant growth regulators is clearly more complicated than it looks and is likely related to differences between fructan molecules in size and structure as well as localization. Fructans are a complex group of carbohydrates composed mainly of fructose units linked to a sucrose molecule. Fructans are present in plants as heterogeneous mixtures with diverse molecular structures and mass, different polymerization degrees, and linkage types between fructosyl residues. Like sucrose, they are frequently stored in leaves and other organs, acting as carbohydrate reserves. Fructans are synthesized in the cell vacuole by fructosyltransferase enzymes and catabolized by fructan exohydrolase enzymes. Several publications have shown that fructan metabolism varies with the stage of plant development and in response to the environment. Recent studies have shown a correlation between plant growth regulators (PGR), fructan metabolism, and tolerance to drought and cold. PGR are compounds that profoundly influence the growth and differentiation of plant cells, tissues, and organs. They play a fundamental role in regulating plant responses to developmental and environmental signals. In this review, we summarize the most up-to-date knowledge on the metabolism of fructans and their crosstalk with PGR signaling pathways. We identify areas that require more research to complete our understanding of the role of fructans in plants.
