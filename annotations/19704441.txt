The prokaryotic signalling molecules (p)ppGpp, also called "magic spots", regulate a wide variety of physiological activities in bacteria, including transcription, translation, and replication as well as some enzymatic activities such as those of some GTP-binding proteins, which are necessary for bacterial cells to adapt their physiology to different environmental stimuli. This response is called the stringent response. Recently, (p)ppGpp molecules and (p)ppGpp synthetase homologues, designated RSHs, have been identified in plants. At least some of the RSHs are targeted to chloroplasts. A knockdown mutation in one of the RSHs results in unusual flower development in Arabidopsis, suggesting that the plastid stringent response has important roles in the physiology of higher plants. Possible (p)ppGpp target proteins are investigated.
