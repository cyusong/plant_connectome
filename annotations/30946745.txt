['30946745', 'Integration of environmental and endogenous cues at plant shoot meristems  determines the timing of flowering and reproductive development. The MADS box  transcription factor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) of Arabidopsis thaliana is an  important repressor of floral transition, which blocks flowering until plants are  exposed to winter cold. However, the target genes of FLC have not been thoroughly  described, and our understanding of the mechanisms by which FLC represses  transcription of these targets and how this repression is overcome during floral  transition is still fragmentary. Here, we identify and characterize TARGET OF FLC  AND SVP1 (TFS1), a novel target gene of FLC and its interacting protein SHORT  VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP). TFS1 encodes a B3-type transcription factor, and we show  that tfs1 mutants are later flowering than wild-type, particularly under short  days. FLC and SVP repress TFS1 transcription leading to deposition of  trimethylation of Iysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) by the Polycomb Repressive  Complex 2 at the TFS1 locus. During floral transition, after downregulation of  FLC by cold, TFS1 transcription is promoted by SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF  CONSTANS1 (SOC1), a MADS box protein encoded by another target of FLC/SVP. SOC1  opposes PRC function at TFS1 through recruitment of the histone demethylase  RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6) and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler ATPase  BRAHMA (BRM). This recruitment of BRM is also strictly required for SQUAMOSA  PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 9 (SPL9) binding at TFS1 to coordinate RNAPII  recruitment through the Mediator complex. Thus, we show that antagonistic  chromatin modifications mediated by different MADS box transcription factor  complexes play a crucial role in defining the temporal and spatial patterns of  transcription of genes within a network of interactions downstream of FLC/SVP  during floral transition.', '2019 Apr', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1008065', 'ORCID:']
