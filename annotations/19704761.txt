It is very well proved that boron (B) plays a primary structural role in the plant cell wall. In addition, this micronutrient has been involved in a great variety of physiological processes in vascular plants. It has been reported that B deficiency induces stress-responsive genes and, in tobacco plants, it seems to decrease net nitrate uptake by repressing expression of root plasmalemma H(+)-ATPase gene. Moreover, root asparagine concentration is clearly increased under B deficiency, as also observed for other abiotic stresses. Accumulation of asparagine in response to abiotic stresses could be an ammonium detoxification mechanism when high amounts of ammonium are internally generated by deamination of soluble amino acids released from enhanced proteolysis under stress conditions. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the several effects caused by B deficiency are unknown. Although a mechanism has been reported to explain B effects based on signals via the cell wall-plasma membrane-cytoskeleton continuum, we propose and discuss the possible role of B as a cellular signal through transcription factors. This hypothetical mechanism could explain not only its diverse effects on so many physiological processes, but also that a negligible amount of boron into the protoplast can be decisive for the normal development of such events.
