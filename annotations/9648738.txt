['9648738', 'The pale cress (pac) mutation arrests chloroplast development at an early stage  in Arabidopsis thaliana and leads to a white phenotype. Chlorophyll fluorescence  measurements demonstrated that the photosynthetic apparatus was impaired. The  mutation did not reduce transcription of nuclear genes with photosynthetic  function. However, distinct chloroplast-encoded transcripts were affected. The  mutation mainly changed the maturation pattern, but the abundance of specific  transcripts was also reduced. The defects observed imply a specific role for PAC  in chloroplast mRNA maturation. PAC is encoded by a nuclear gene and is  transported into the chloroplast. Therefore PAC may be one of the nucleus-encoded  factors that function in plastid mRNA maturation and accumulation.', '1998 May', 'Mol Gen Genet', '10.1007/s004380050740', 'Reiss']
