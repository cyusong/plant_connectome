Understanding of intercontinental distribution in the Northern Hemisphere has attracted a lot of attention from botanists. However, although Orchidaceae is the largest group of angiosperms, biogeographical studies on the disjunctive pattern have not been sufficient for this family. <i>Goodyera</i> R. Br. (tribe Cranichideae, subfamily Orchidoideae, family Orchidaceae) is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions. Although the phylogenetic relationship of <i>Goodyera</i> inferred from both morphological and molecular data has been conducted, the sampled taxa were mainly distributed in Asia regions that resulted in non-monophyly of this genus. In this study, the complete plastid genomes of <i>Goodyera</i>, generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique and sampled in East Asia and North America, were used to reconstruct phylogeny and explore the historical biogeography. A total of 18 <i>Goodyera</i> species including seven newly sequenced species were analyzed. Based on 79 protein-coding genes, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that <i>Goodyera</i> could be subdivided into four subclades with high support values. The polyphyletic relationships among <i>Goodyera</i> taxa were confirmed, and the unclear position of <i>G. foliosa</i> was also resolved. The datasets that are composed of the 14 coding sequences (CDS) (<i>mat</i>K, <i>atp</i>F, <i>ndh</i>K, <i>acc</i>D, <i>cem</i>A, <i>clp</i>P, <i>rpo</i>A, <i>rpl</i>22, <i>ndh</i>F, <i>ccs</i>A, <i>ndh</i>D, <i>ndh</i>I, <i>ndh</i>A, and <i>ycf</i> 1) showed the same topology derived from 79 protein-coding genes. Molecular dating analyses revealed the origin of <i>Goodyera</i> in the mid-Miocene (15.75 Mya). Nearctic clade of <i>Goodyera</i> was diverged at 10.88 Mya from their most recent common ancestor (MRCA). The biogeographical reconstruction suggests that subtropical or tropical Asia is the origin of <i>Goodyera</i> and it has subsequently spread to temperate Asia during the Miocene. In addition, Nearctic clade is derived from East Asian species through Bering Land Bridge (BLB) during the Miocene. The speciation of <i>Goodyera</i> is most likely to have occurred during Miocene, and climatic and geological changes are thought to have had a part in this diversification. Our findings propose both origin and vicariance events of <i>Goodyera</i> for the first time and add an example for the biogeographical history of the Northern Hemisphere.
