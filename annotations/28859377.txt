The biphasic floral transition in Arabidopsis thaliana involves many redundant intersecting regulatory networks. The related AP2 transcription factors DORNRÖSCHEN (DRN), DORNRÖSCHEN-LIKE (DRNL), and PUCHI individually execute well-characterized functions in diverse developmental contexts, including floral development. Here, we show that their combined loss of function leads to synergistic floral phenotypes, including reduced floral merosity in all whorls, which reflects redundant functions of all three genes in organ initiation rather than outgrowth. Additional loss of BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1 (BOP1) and BOP2 functions results in the complete conversion of floral meristems into secondary inflorescence shoots, demonstrating that all five genes define an essential regulatory network for establishing floral meristem identity, and we show that their functions converge to regulate LEAFY expression. Thus, despite their largely discrete spatiotemporal expression domains in the inflorescence meristem and early floral meristem, PUCHI, DRN, and DRNL interdependently contribute to cellular fate decisions. Auxin might represent one potential non-cell-autonomous mediator of their gene functions, because PUCHI, DRN, and DRNL all interact with auxin transport and biosynthesis pathways.
