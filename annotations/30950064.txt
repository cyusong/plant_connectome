Split-root system has been developed to better understand plant response to environmental factors, by exposing two separate parts of a single root system to heterogeneous situations. Surprisingly, there is no study attempting to maximize plant survival, growth and root system structure through a statistically sound comparison of different experimental protocols. Here, we aim at optimizing split-root systems on the model plant for Poaceae and cereals Brachypodium distachyon in terms of plant survival, number of roots and their equal distribution between the two compartments. We tested the effect of hydroponic or soil as growing media, with or without change of media at the transplantation step. The partial or total cutting of roots and/or shoots was also tested in different treatments as it could have an influence on plant access to energy and water and consequently on survival, growth and root development. Growing plants in soil before and after transplantation in split-root system was the best condition to get the highest survival rate, number of coleoptile node axile roots and growth. Cutting the whole root system was the best option to have a high root biomass and length at the end of the experiment. However, cutting shoots was detrimental for plant growth, especially in terms of root biomass production. In well-watered conditions, a plant submitted to a transfer in a split-root system is thus mainly lacking energy to produce new roots thanks to photosynthesis or adaptive autophagy, not water or nutrients.

hydroponic/soil: !affects! plant survival
partial/total cutting of roots/shoots: !influences! access to energy/water
soil before/after transplantation: !maximizes! survival rate/number of roots
cutting whole root system: !increases! root biomass/length
cutting shoots: !detrimental for! growth
