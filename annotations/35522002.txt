Seed germination represents a major developmental switch in plants that is vital to agriculture, but how this process is controlled at the chromatin level remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that successful germination in Arabidopsis thaliana requires a chromatin mechanism that progressively silences 9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 6 (NCED6), which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, through the cooperative action of the RNA-binding protein RZ-1 and the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Simultaneous inactivation of RZ-1 and PRC2 blocked germination and synergistically derepressed NCEDs and hundreds of genes. At NCED6, in part by promoting H3 deacetylation and suppressing H3K4me3, RZ-1 facilitates transcriptional silencing and also an H3K27me3 accumulation process that occurs during seed germination and early seedling growth. Genome-wide analysis revealed that RZ-1 is preferentially required for transcriptional silencing of many PRC2 targets early during seed germination, when H3K27me3 is not yet established. We propose RZ-1 confers a novel silencing mechanism to compensate for and synergize with PRC2. Our work highlights the progressive chromatin silencing of ABA biosynthesis genes via the RNA-binding protein RZ-1 and PRC2 acting in synergy, a process that is vital for seed germination.
