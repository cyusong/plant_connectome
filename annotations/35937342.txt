Rice blast, caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (<i>M. oryzae</i>), is one of the most destructive diseases threatening rice production worldwide. Development of resistant cultivars using broad-spectrum resistance (<i>R</i>) genes with high breeding value is the most effective and economical approach to control this disease. In this study, the breeding potential of <i>Pigm</i> gene in <i>geng</i>/<i>japonica</i> rice breeding practice in Jiangsu province was comprehensively evaluated. Through backcross and marker-assisted selection (MAS), <i>Pigm</i> was introduced into two <i>geng</i> rice cultivars (Wuyungeng 32/WYG32 and Huageng 8/HG8). In each genetic background, five advanced backcross lines with <i>Pigm</i> (ABLs) and the same genotypes as the respective recurrent parent in the other 13 known <i>R</i> gene loci were developed. Compared with the corresponding recurrent parent, all these ABLs exhibited stronger resistance in seedling inoculation assay using 184 isolates collected from rice growing regions of the lower region of the Yangtze River. With respect to panicle blast resistance, all ABLs reached a high resistance level to blast disease in tests conducted in three consecutive years with the inoculation of seven mixed conidial suspensions collected from different regions of Jiangsu province. In natural field nursery assays, the ABLs showed significantly higher resistance than the recurrent parents. No common change on importantly morphological traits and yield-associated components was found among the ABLs, demonstrating the introduction of <i>Pigm</i> had no tightly linked undesirable effect on rice economically important traits and its associated grain weight reduction effect could be probably offset by others grain weight genes or at least in the background of the aforementioned two varieties. Notably, one rice line with <i>Pigm</i>, designated as Yangnonggeng 3091, had been authorized as a new variety in Jiangsu province in 2021, showing excellent performance on both grain yield and quality, as well as the blast resistance. Together, these results suggest that the <i>Pigm</i> gene has a high breeding value in developing rice varieties with durable and broad-spectrum resistance to blast disease.
