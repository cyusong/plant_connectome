The tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is the causal agent of one of the most severe diseases affecting tomato growth; however, nitric oxide (NO) can mediate plant resistance. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of exogenous NO donor-mediated disease resistance in tomato seedlings. Tomato seedlings were treated with sodium nitroprusside and TYLCV and subjected to phenotypic, transcriptomic, and physiological analyses. The results show that exogenous NO significantly reduced disease index, MDA content, and virus content (71.4%), significantly increased stem length and fresh weight of diseased plants (p < 0.05), and improved photosynthesis with an induction effect of up to 44.0%. In this study, it was found that the reduction in virus content caused by the increased expression of peptidase inhibitor genes was the main reason for the increased resistance in tomatoes. The peptidase inhibitor inhibited protease activity and restrained virus synthesis, while the significant reduction in virus content inevitably caused a partial weakening or shutdown of the disease response process in the diseased plant. In addition, exogenous NO also induces superoxide dismutase, peroxidase activity, fatty acid elongation, resistance protein, lignin, and monoterpene synthesis to improve resistance. In summary, exogenous NO enhances resistance in tomatoes mainly by regulating peptidase inhibitor genes.
