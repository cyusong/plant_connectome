['35017541', "In plants, cell polarity plays key roles in coordinating developmental processes.  Despite the characterization of several polarly localized plasma membrane  proteins, the mechanisms connecting protein dynamics with cellular functions  often remain unclear. Here, we introduce a polarized receptor, KOIN, that  restricts cell divisions in the Arabidopsis root meristem. In the endodermis,  KOIN polarity is opposite to IRK, a receptor that represses endodermal cell  divisions. Their contra-polar localization facilitates dissection of polarity  mechanisms and the links between polarity and function. We find that IRK and KOIN  are recognized, sorted, and secreted through distinct pathways. IRK extracellular  domains determine its polarity and partially rescue the mutant phenotype, whereas  KOIN's extracellular domains are insufficient for polar sorting and function.  Endodermal expression of an IRK/KOIN chimera generates non-cell-autonomous  misregulation of root cell divisions that impacts patterning. Altogether, we  reveal two contrasting mechanisms determining these receptors' polarity and link  their polarity to cell divisions in root tissue patterning.", '2022 Jan 11', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-021-27913-1', 'ORCID:']
