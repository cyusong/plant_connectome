Lateral organ distribution at the shoot apical meristem defines specific and robust phyllotaxis patterns that have intrigued biologists and mathematicians for centuries. In silico studies have revealed that this self-organizing process can be recapitulated by modeling the polar transport of the phytohormone auxin. Phyllotactic patterns change between species and developmental stages, but the processes behind these variations have remained unknown. Here we use regional complementation experiments to reveal that phyllotactic switches in Arabidopsis shoots can be mediated by PLETHORA-dependent control of local auxin biosynthesis.

PLETHORA: !controls! auxin biosynthesis
auxin: !affects! phyllotactic patterns
phyllotaxis: !varies between! species and developmental stages
