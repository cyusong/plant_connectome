Granum is a basic structural unit of the thylakoid membrane network of plant chloroplasts. It is composed of multiple flattened membranes forming a stacked arrangement of a cylindrical shape. Grana membranes are composed of lipids and tightly packed pigment-protein complexes whose primary role is the catalysis of photosynthetic light reactions. These membranes are highly dynamic structures capable of adapting to changing environmental conditions by fine-tuning photochemical efficiency, manifested by the structural reorganization of grana stacks. Due to a nanometer length scale of the structural granum features, the application of high-resolution electron microscopic techniques is essential for a detailed analysis of the granum architecture. This mini-review overviews recent approaches to quantitative grana structure analyses from electron microscopy data, highlighting the basic manual measurements and semi-automated workflows. We outline and define structural parameters used by different authors, for instance, granum height and diameter, thylakoid thickness, end-membrane length, Stacking Repeat Distance, and Granum Lateral Irregularity. This article also presents insights into efficient and effective measurements of grana stacks visualized on 2D micrographs. The information on how to correctly interpret obtained data, taking into account the 3D nature of grana stacks projected onto 2D space of electron micrograph, is also given. Grana ultrastructural observations reveal key features of this intriguing membrane arrangement, broadening our knowledge of the thylakoid network's remarkable plasticity.
