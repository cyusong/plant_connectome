['23203051', 'Riboflavin serves as a precursor for flavocoenzymes (FMN and FAD) and is  essential for all living organisms. The two committed enzymatic steps of  riboflavin biosynthesis are performed in plants by bifunctional RIBA enzymes  comprised of GTP cyclohydrolase II (GCHII) and  3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase (DHBPS). Angiosperms share a small  RIBA gene family consisting of three members. A reduction of AtRIBA1 expression  in the Arabidopsis rfd1mutant and in RIBA1 antisense lines is not complemented by  the simultaneously expressed isoforms AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3. The intensity of the  bleaching leaf phenotype of RIBA1 deficient plants correlates with the  inactivation of AtRIBA1 expression, while no significant effects on the mRNA  abundance of AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3 were observed. We examined reasons why both  isoforms fail to sufficiently compensate for a lack of RIBA1 expression. All  three RIBA isoforms are shown to be translocated into chloroplasts as GFP fusion  proteins. Interestingly, both AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3 have amino acid exchanges in  conserved peptides domains that have been found to be essential for the two  enzymatic functions. In vitro activity assays of GCHII and DHBPS with all of the  three purified recombinant AtRIBA proteins and complementation of E. coli ribA  and ribB mutants lacking DHBPS and GCHII expression, respectively, confirmed the  loss of bifunctionality for AtRIBA2 and AtRIBA3. Phylogenetic analyses imply that  the monofunctional, bipartite RIBA3 proteins, which have lost DHBPS activity,  evolved early in tracheophyte evolution.', '2012 Oct 31', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms131114086', 'Grimm']
