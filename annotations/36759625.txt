Salivary elicitors secreted by herbivorous insects can be perceived by host plants to trigger plant immunity. However, how insects secrete other salivary components to subsequently attenuate the elicitor-induced plant immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we study the small brown planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus salivary sheath protein LsSP1. Using Y2H, BiFC and LUC assays, we show that LsSP1 is secreted into host plants and binds to salivary sheath via mucin-like protein (LsMLP). Rice plants pre-infested with dsLsSP1-treated L. striatellus are less attractive to L. striatellus nymphs than those pre-infected with dsGFP-treated controls. Transgenic rice plants with LsSP1 overexpression rescue the insect feeding defects caused by a deficiency of LsSP1 secretion, consistent with the potential role of LsSP1 in manipulating plant defenses. Our results illustrate the importance of salivary sheath proteins in mediating the interactions between plants and herbivorous insects.
