The apparent climatic extremes affect the growth and developmental process of cool-season grain legumes, especially the high-temperature stress. The present study aimed to investigate the impacts of high-temperature stress on crop phenology, seed set, and seed quality parameters, which are still uncertain in tropical environments. Therefore, a panel of 150 field pea genotypes, grouped as early (<i>n</i> = 88) and late (<i>n</i> = 62) maturing, were exposed to high-temperature environments following staggered sowing [normal sowing time or non-heat stress environment (NHSE); moderately late sowing (15 days after normal sowing) or heat stress environment-I (HSE-I); and very-late sowing (30 days after normal sowing) or HSE-II]. The average maximum temperature during flowering was about 22.5 ± 0.17°C for NHSE and increased to 25.9 ± 0.11°C and 30.6 ± 0.19°C in HSE-I and HSE-II, respectively. The average maximum temperature during the reproductive period (RP) (flowering to maturity) was in the order HSE-II (33.3 ± 0.03°C) > HSE-I (30.5 ± 0.10°C) > NHSE (27.3 ± 0.10°C). The high-temperature stress reduced the seed yield (24-60%) and seed germination (4-8%) with a prominent effect on long-duration genotypes. The maximum reduction in seed germination (>15%) was observed in HSE-II for genotypes with >115 days maturity duration, which was primarily attributed to higher ambient maximum temperature during the RP. Under HSEs, the reduction in the RP in early- and late-maturing genotypes was 13-23 and 18-33%, suggesting forced maturity for long-duration genotypes under late-sown conditions. The cumulative growing degree days at different crop stages had significant associations (<i>p</i> < 0.001) with seed germination in both early- and late-maturing genotypes; and the results further demonstrate that an extended vegetative period could enhance the 100-seed weight and seed germination. Reduction in seed set (7-14%) and 100-seed weight (6-16%) was observed under HSEs, particularly in HSE-II. The positive associations of 100-seed weight were observed with seed germination and germination rate in the late-maturing genotypes, whereas in early-maturing genotypes, a negative association was observed for 100-seed weight and germination rate. The GGE biplot analysis identified IPFD 11-5, Pant P-72, P-1544-1, and HUDP 11 as superior genotypes, as they possess an ability to produce more viable seeds under heat stress conditions. Such genotypes will be useful in developing field pea varieties for quality seed production under the high-temperature environments.
