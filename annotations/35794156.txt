Major crops are all survivors of domestication bottlenecks. Studies have focused on the genetic loci related to the domestication syndrome, while the contribution of ancient haplotypes remains largely unknown. Here, an ancestral genomic haploblock dissection method is developed and applied to a resequencing dataset of 386 tetraploid/hexaploid wheat accessions, generating a pan-ancestry haploblock map. Together with cytoplastic evidences, we reveal that domesticated polyploid wheat emerged from the admixture of six founder wild emmer lineages, which contributed the foundation of ancestral mosaics. The key domestication-related loci, originated over a wide geographical range, were gradually pyramided through a protracted process. Diverse stable-inheritance ancestral haplotype groups of the chromosome central zone are identified, revealing the expanding routes of wheat and the trends of modern wheat breeding. Finally, an evolution model of polyploid wheat is proposed, highlighting the key role of wild-to-crop and interploidy introgression, that increased genomic diversity following bottlenecks introduced by domestication and polyploidization.
