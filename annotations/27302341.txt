['27302341', 'Calcium is important for chloroplast, not only in its photosynthetic but also  nonphotosynthetic functions. Multiple Ca(2+)/H(+) transporters and channels have  been described and studied in the plasma membrane and organelle membranes of  plant cells; however, the molecular identity and physiological roles of  chloroplast Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporters have remained unknown. Here we report the  identification and characterization of a member of the UPF0016 family, CCHA1 (a  chloroplast-localized potential Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporter), in Arabidopsis thaliana.  We observed that the ccha1 mutant plants developed pale green leaves and showed  severely stunted growth along with impaired photosystem II (PSII) function. CCHA1  localizes to the chloroplasts, and the levels of the PSII core subunits and the  oxygen-evolving complex were significantly decreased in the ccha1 mutants  compared with the wild type. In high Ca(2+) concentrations, Arabidopsis CCHA1  partially rescued the growth defect of yeast gdt1Delta null mutant, which is  defective in a Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporter. The ccha1 mutant plants also showed  significant sensitivity to high concentrations of CaCl2 and MnCl2, as well as  variation in pH. Taken these results together, we propose that CCHA1 might encode  a putative chloroplast-localized Ca(2+)/H(+) antiporter with critical functions  in the regulation of PSII and in chloroplast Ca(2+) and pH homeostasis in  Arabidopsis.', '2016 Aug 1', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2016.05.015', 'Yang']
