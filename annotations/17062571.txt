Cell wall hydrolases are well documented to be present on pollen, but their roles on the stigma during sexual reproduction have not been previously demonstrated. We explored the function of the tapetum-synthesized xylanase, ZmXYN1, on maize (Zea mays L.) pollen. Transgenic lines (xyl-less) containing little or no xylanase in the pollen coat were generated with use of an antisense construct of the xylanase gene-coding region driven by the XYN1 gene promoter. Xyl-less and wild-type plants had similar vegetative growth. Electron microscopy revealed no appreciable morphological difference in anther cells and pollen between xyl-less lines and the wild type, whereas immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical analyses indicated an absence of xylanase on xyl-less pollen. Xyl-less pollen germinated as efficiently as wild-type pollen in vitro in a liquid medium but less so on gel media of increasing solidity or on silk, which is indicative of partial impaired water uptake. Once germinated in vitro or on silk, the xyl-less and wild-type pollen tubes elongated at comparable rates. Tubes of germinated xyl-less pollen on silk did not penetrate into the silk as efficiently as tubes of wild-type pollen, and this lower efficiency could be overcome by the addition of xylanase to the silk. For wild-type pollen, coat xylanase activity on oat spelled xylan in vitro and tube penetration into silk were inhibited by xylose but not glucose. The overall findings indicate that maize pollen coat xylanase facilitates pollen tube penetration into silk via enzymatic xylan hydrolysis.
