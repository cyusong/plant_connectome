Stem cells are the ultimate source of cells for various tissues and organs, and thus are essential for postembryonic plant growth and development. SCARECROW (SCR) is a plant-specific transcription regulator well known for its role in stem-cell renewal in plant roots, but the mechanism by which SCR exerts this function remains unclear. To address this question, we carried out a genetic screen for mutants that no longer express SCR in the stem-cell niche of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots and characterized one of these mutants. Molecular genetics methods allowed us to pinpoint the causal mutation in this mutant in TELOMERIC PATHWAYS IN ASSOCIATION WITH STN 1 (TEN1), encoding a factor that protects telomere ends. Interestingly, TEN1 expression was dramatically reduced in the scr mutant. Telomerase, as well as STN1 and CONSERVED TELOMERE MAINTENANCE COMPONENT 1 (CTC1), components of the same protein complex as TEN1, were also dramatically downregulated in scr. Loss of STN1, CTC1, and telomerase caused defects in root stem cells. These results together suggest that SCR maintains root stem cells by promoting expression of genes that ensure genome integrity. Supporting this conclusion, we demonstrated that the scr mutant accumulates more DNA damage than wild-type Arabidopsis and that this problem is aggravated after exposure to zeocin, a DNA damage reagent. Finally, we identified two previously uncharacterized motifs in TEN1 and provide evidence that a conserved amino acid residue in one of the motifs is indispensable for TEN1 function. SCR thus provides a connection between genome integrity and stem-cell maintenance in Arabidopsis roots.
