['21610183', 'Osmotic stress activates the biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA). One major step  in ABA biosynthesis is the carotenoid cleavage catalyzed by a 9-cis  epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED). To understand the mechanism for osmotic  stress activation of ABA biosynthesis, we screened for Arabidopsis thaliana  mutants that failed to induce the NCED3 gene expression in response to osmotic  stress treatments. The ced1 (for 9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase defective 1)  mutant isolated in this study showed markedly reduced expression of NCED3 in  response to osmotic stress (polyethylene glycol) treatments compared with the  wild type. Other ABA biosynthesis genes are also greatly reduced in ced1 under  osmotic stress. ced1 mutant plants are very sensitive to even mild osmotic  stress. Map-based cloning revealed unexpectedly that CED1 encodes a putative alpha/beta  hydrolase domain-containing protein and is allelic to the BODYGUARD gene that was  recently shown to be essential for cuticle biogenesis. Further studies discovered  that other cutin biosynthesis mutants are also impaired in osmotic stress  induction of ABA biosynthesis genes and are sensitive to osmotic stress. Our work  demonstrates that the cuticle functions not merely as a physical barrier to  minimize water loss but also mediates osmotic stress signaling and tolerance by  regulating ABA biosynthesis and signaling.', '2011 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.081943', 'Zhu']
