['9048879', 'A cDNA clone, Sat-52, encoding a novel isoform of serine acetyltransferase (EC  2.3.1.30) was isolated by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli cysE  mutant defective in serine acetyltransferase. The 1158 base pair clone contains a  full-length open reading frame encoding a deduced protein of 312 amino acids with  an M(r) of 32.77 kDa. Northern analysis revealed a single transcript of ca 1.19  kb that did not increase in abundance under sulfate limitation. Genomic Southern  hybridization suggests the presence of a single copy of the Sat-52 gene.', '1997 Feb 7', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/s0167-4781(96)00213-8', 'Wray']
