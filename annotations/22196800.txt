['22196800', 'An essential step in the biosynthesis of bioactive brassinosteroids (BRs) in  plants is the hydroxylation at C-22, a reaction catalyzed by P450 enzymes of the  CYP90B and CYP724B subfamilies. Genes for both types of enzymes are present in  many species, and in rice (Oryza sativa) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) both  CYP90B and CYP724B enzymes contribute to C-22 hydroxylation. In Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana), C-22 hydroxylation of BRs is catalyzed by CYP90B1  (encoded by DWF4) and null dwf4 mutants show severe symptoms of BR-deficiency.  CYP724A1 (At5g14400), an Arabidopsis gene of unknown function and limited  expression, encodes a P450 sharing less than 55% sequence identity to CYP724B  proteins. We used transgenic plants of the null mutants dwf4-102 and a novel  allele, bashful (bsf), ectopically expressing the CYP724A1 gene to investigate  the potential activity of CYP724A1 as a C-22 hydroxylase of BRs. Defects  associated with BR deficiency were reversed and a normal growth habit restored in  transgenic dwf4-102 and bsf plants overexpressing CYP724A1. The vegetative phase  was prolonged and the transgenic plants were on average larger than wild type  plants with respect to several morphometric parameters. Fertility was restored in  the transgenic plants but individual siliques yielded fewer and heavier seeds  than those of wild type plants. The implications of these findings with regard to  the functions of CYP724A1 and the activity of its encoded enzyme are discussed.', '2012 Mar 1', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2011.10.013', 'da']
