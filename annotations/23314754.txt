Understanding the principles of abiotic and biotic stress responses, tolerance and adaptation remains important in plant physiology research to develop better varieties of crop plants. Better understanding of plant stress response mechanisms and application of knowledge derived from integrated experimental and bioinformatics approaches are gaining importance. Earlier, we showed that compiling a database of stress-responsive transcription factors and their corresponding target binding sites in the form of Hidden Markov models at promoter, untranslated and upstream regions of stress-up-regulated genes from expression analysis can help in elucidating various aspects of the stress response in Arabidopsis. In addition to the extensive content in the first version, STIFDB2 is now updated with 15 stress signals, 31 transcription factors and 5,984 stress-responsive genes from three species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa subsp. japonica and Oryza sativa subsp. indica). We have employed an integrated biocuration and genomic data mining approach to characterize the data set of transcription factors and consensus binding sites from literature mining and stress-responsive genes from the Gene Expression Omnibus. STIFDB2 currently has 38,798 associations of stress signals, stress-responsive genes and transcription factor binding sites predicted using the Stress-responsive Transcription Factor (STIF) algorithm, along with various functional annotation data. As a unique plant stress regulatory genomics data platform, STIFDB2 can be utilized for targeted as well as high-throughput experimental and computational studies to unravel principles of the stress regulome in dicots and gramineae.
