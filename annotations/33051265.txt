Plants detect proximity of competitors through reduction in the ratio between red and far-red light that triggers the shade avoidance syndrome, inducing responses such as accelerated shoot elongation and early flowering. Shade avoidance is regulated by PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs, a group of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. Another (b)HLH protein, KIDARI (KDR), which is non-DNA-binding, was identified in de-etiolation studies and proposed to interact with LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1 (HFR1), a (b)HLH protein that inhibits shade avoidance. Here, we established roles of KDR in regulating shade avoidance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and investigated how KDR regulates the shade avoidance network. We showed that KDR is a positive regulator of shade avoidance and interacts with several negative growth regulators. We identified KDR interactors using a combination of yeast two-hybrid screening and dedicated confirmations with bimolecular fluorescence complementation. We demonstrated that KDR is translocated primarily to the nucleus when coexpressed with these interactors. A genetic approach confirmed that several of these interactions play a functional role in shade avoidance; however, we propose that KDR does not interact with HFR1 to regulate shade avoidance. Based on these observations, we propose that shade avoidance is regulated by a three-layered gas-and-brake mechanism of bHLH protein interactions, adding a layer of complexity to what was previously known.
