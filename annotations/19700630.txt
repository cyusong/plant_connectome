['19700630', 'Plant immune responses depend on dynamic signaling events across the nuclear  envelope through nuclear pores. Nuclear accumulation of certain resistance (R)  proteins and downstream signal transducers are critical for their functions, but  it is not understood how these processes are controlled. Here, we report the  identification, cloning, and analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana modifier of snc1,7  (mos7-1), a partial loss-of-function mutation that suppresses immune responses  conditioned by the autoactivated R protein snc1 (for suppressor of npr1-1,  constitutive 1). mos7-1 single mutant plants exhibit defects in basal and R  protein-mediated immunity and in systemic acquired resistance but do not display  obvious pleiotropic defects in development, salt tolerance, or plant hormone  responses. MOS7 is homologous to human and Drosophila melanogaster nucleoporin  Nup88 and resides at the nuclear envelope. In animals, Nup88 attenuates nuclear  export of activated NF-kappaB transcription factors, resulting in nuclear  accumulation of NF-kappaB. Our analysis shows that nuclear accumulation of snc1  and the defense signaling components Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 and  Nonexpresser of PR genes 1 is significantly reduced in mos7-1 plants, while  nuclear retention of other tested proteins is unaffected. The data suggest that  specifically modulating the nuclear concentrations of certain defense proteins  regulates defense outputs.', '2009 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.064519', 'Li']
