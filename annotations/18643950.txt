['18643950', 'Plastids are surrounded by two membrane layers, the outer and inner envelope  membranes, which have various transport and metabolic activities. A number of  envelope membrane proteins have been identified by biochemical approaches and  have been assigned to specific functions. Despite those efforts, the chloroplast  envelope membrane is expected to contain a number of as yet unidentified proteins  that may affect specific aspects of plant growth and development. In this report,  we identify and characterize a novel class of inner envelope membrane proteins,  designated as Cor413 chloroplast inner envelope membrane group (Cor413im). Both  in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that Cor413im proteins are targeted to the  chloroplast envelope. Biochemical analyses of Cor413im1 demonstrate that it is an  integral membrane protein in the inner envelope of chloroplasts. Quantitative  real-time PCR analysis reveals that COR413IM1 is more abundant than COR413IM2 in  cold-acclimated Arabidopsis leaves. The analyses of T-DNA insertion mutants  indicate that a single copy of COR413IM genes is sufficient to provide normal  freezing tolerance to Arabidopsis. Based on these data, we propose that Cor413im  proteins are novel components that are targeted to the chloroplast inner envelope  in response to low temperature.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01854.x', 'Inaba']
