Tricopeptide repeats are common in natural proteins, and are exemplified by 34- and 35-residue repeats, known respectively as tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and pentatricopeptide repeats (PPRs). In both classes, each repeat unit forms an antiparallel bihelical structure, so that multiple such units in a polypeptide are arranged in a parallel fashion. The primary structures of the motifs are nonidentical, but amino acids of similar properties occur in strategic positions. The focus of the present work was on PPR, but TPR, its better-studied cousin, is often included for comparison. The analyses revealed that critical amino acids, namely Gly, Pro, Ala and Trp, were placed at distinct locations in the higher order structure of PPR domains. While most TPRs occur in repeats of three, the PPRs exhibited a much greater diversity in repeat numbers, from 1 to 30 or more, separated by spacers of various sequences and lengths. Studies of PPR strings in proteins showed that the majority of PPR units are single, and that the longer tandems (i.e., without space in between) occurred in decreasing order. The multi-PPR domains also formed superhelical vortices, likely governed by interhelical angles rather than the spacers. These findings should be useful in designing and understanding the PPR domains.
