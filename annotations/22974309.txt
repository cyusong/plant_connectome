['22974309', 'Lateral root formation, a developmental process under the control of the plant  hormone auxin, is a major determinant of root architecture, and defines the  ability of a plant to acquire nutrients and water. The LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES  DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE (LBD/ASL) proteins play an important role in the  lateral organ development of plants, including lateral root formation. However,  their downstream components and signalling mechanisms are largely unknown. Here,  we show that auxin-responsive LBD18/ASL20 acts as a specific DNA-binding  transcriptional activator that directly regulates EXPANSIN14 (EXP14), a gene  encoding a cell wall-loosening factor that promotes lateral root emergence in  Arabidopsis thaliana. We showed that LBD18 possesses transcription-activating  function in both yeast and Arabidopsis protoplasts. We isolated putative LBD18  target genes by microarray analysis, and identified EXP14 as a direct target of  LBD18. Dexamethasone-induced expression of LBD18 under the CaMV 35S promoter in  transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in enhanced expression of GUS fused to the EXP14  promoter in primordium and overlaying tissues. In contrast, GUS expression under  the EXP14 promoter in the lbd18 mutant background was significantly reduced in  the same tissues. Experiments using a variety of molecular techniques  demonstrated that LBD18 activates EXP14 by directly binding to a specific  promoter element in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of EXP14 in Arabidopsis  resulted in the stimulation of emerged lateral roots, but not primordia, whereas  EXP14 loss-of-function plants had reduced auxin-stimulated lateral root  formation. This study revealed the molecular function of LBD18 as a specific  DNA-binding transcription factor that activates EXP14 expression by directly  binding to its promoter.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12013', 'Kim']
