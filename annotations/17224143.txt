['17224143', "Pyridoxine (pyridoxamine) 5'-phosphate oxidase (PPOX) catalyzes the oxidative  conversion of pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP) or pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) to  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP). The At5g49970 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana shows  homology to PPOX's from a number of organisms including the Saccharomyces  cerevisiae PDX3 gene. A cDNA corresponding to putative A. thaliana PPOX (AtPPOX)  was obtained using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and primers  landing at the start and stop codons of At5g49970. The putative AtPPOX is 530  amino acid long and predicted to contain three distinct parts: a 64 amino acid  long N-terminal putative chloroplast transit peptide, followed by a long Yjef_N  domain of unknown function and a C-terminal Pyridox_oxidase domain. Recombinant  proteins representing the C-terminal domain of AtPPOX and AtPPOX without transit  peptide were expressed in E. coli and showed PPOX enzyme activity. The PDX3  knockout yeast deficient in PPOX activity exhibited sensitivity to oxidative  stress. Constructs of AtPPOX cDNA of different lengths complemented the PDX3  knockout yeast for oxidative stress. The role of the Yjef_N domain of AtPPOX was  not determined, but it shows homology with a number of conserved hypothetical  proteins of unknown function.", '2007 Feb 6', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2006.12.028', 'Singh']
