Phytophthora sojae causes Phytophthora root and stem rot disease of soybean (Glycine max), leading to huge annual yield loss worldwide, but resistance to Phytophthora sojae (Rps) genes remain elusive. Soybean cultivar 'Yudou 29' is resistant to P. sojae strain PsMC1, and this study aimed to clone, identify, and characterize the Rps gene in Yudou 29 (RpsYD29) and clarify its functional mechanism. We map-based cloned RpsYD29 (ZINC FINGER PROTEIN03, GmZFP03) using the families of a cross between Yudou 29 and a P. sojae-susceptible soybean cultivar 'Jikedou 2'. P. sojae-resistance of GmZFP03 was functionally validated by stable soybean genetic transformation and allele-phenotype association analysis. GmZFP03 was identified as a C2H2-type zinc finger protein transcription factor, showing four-amino acid residue polymorphisms (V79F, G122-, G123-, and D125V) and remarkably different expression patterns between resistant and susceptible soybeans. Notably boosted activity and gene expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in resistant-type GmZFP03-expressed transgenic soybean, substantial enhancement of P. sojae resistance of wild-type soybean by exogenous SOD treatment, and GmZFP03 binding to and activation of two SOD1 (Glyma.03g242900 and Glyma.19g240400) promoters demonstrated the involvement of SOD1s in GmZFP03-mediated resistance to P. sojae strain PsMC1. Thus, this study cloned the soybean P. sojae-resistant GmZFP03, the product of which specifically targets two SOD1 promoters. GmZFP03 can be directly used for precise P. sojae-resistance soybean breeding.
