MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control various biological processes by repressing target mRNAs. In plants, miRNAs mediate target gene repression via both mRNA cleavage and translational repression. However, the mechanism underlying this translational repression is poorly understood. Here, we found that Arabidopsis thaliana HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1), a core component of the miRNA processing machinery, regulates miRNA-mediated mRNA translation but not miRNA biogenesis when it localized in the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic HYL1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and associates with ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) and ALTERED MERISTEM PROGRAM1. In the cytoplasm, HYL1 monitors the distribution of AGO1 onto polysomes, binds to the mRNAs of target genes, represses their translation, and partially rescues the phenotype of the hyl1 null mutant. This study uncovered another function of HYL1 and provides insight into the mechanism of plant gene regulation.
