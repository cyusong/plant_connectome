['29976837', 'The dynamic arrangement of cortical microtubules (MTs) plays a pivotal role in  controlling cell growth and shape formation in plants, but the mechanisms by  which cortical MTs are organized to regulate these processes are not well  characterized. In particular, the dynamic behavior of cortical MTs is critical  for their spatial organization, yet the molecular mechanisms controlling MT  dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we used the puzzle piece-shaped  pavement cells of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves as a model system in  which to study cortical MT organization. We isolated an ethyl methanesulfonate  mutant with reduced interdigitation of pavement cells in cotyledons. This line  carried a mutation in IQ67 DOMAIN5 (IQD5), which encodes a member of the  plant-specific IQ motif protein family. Live-cell imaging and biochemical  analyses demonstrated that IQD5 binds to MTs and promotes MT assembly.  MT-depolymerizing drug treatment and in vivo MT dynamics assays suggested that  IQD5 functions to stabilize MTs. Hence, our findings provide genetic, cell  biological, and biochemical evidence that IQD5 regulates MT dynamics that affect  MT organization and subsequent cell shape formation.', '2018 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.18.00558', 'ORCID:']
