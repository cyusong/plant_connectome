Wheat is an essential energy and protein source for humans. Climate change brings daunting challenges to wheat yield through environmental stresses, in which phytohormones play critical roles. Nevertheless, the comprehensive understanding of wheat phytohormone responses remains elusive. Here, we investigated the transcriptome response of wheat seedlings to five phytohormones, cytokinin (6-BA), abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid (GA), jasmonate (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). We further selected two JA marker genes and cloned their promoters to drive the expression of 3XEGFP (tandem trimeric enhanced green fluorescent protein) in transgenic lines. The JA fluorescent reporter displayed a fast and stable response to JA treatment as an ideal tool to follow JA dynamics during fungal and cold stresses at a cellular resolution. Overall, this study provided a transcriptional landscape and facilitated generating fluorescent reporters to monitor the dynamics of phytohormones in food crops.
