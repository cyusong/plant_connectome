In both animal and plants, establishment of body axes is fundamental for proper organ development. Plant roots show two main developmental axes: the proximo-distal axis, which spans from the hypocotyl-root junction to the root tip; and the radial axis, which traverses from the vascular tissue to the epidermis. Root axes are determined in the root meristem. The root meristem occupies the tip of the root and contains self-renewing stem cells, which continuously produce new root cells. An intricate network of signalling pathways regulates meristem function and patterning to ensure proper root development and growth. In the last decade, miRNAs, 20-21 nucleotide-long molecules with morphogenetic activity, emerged as central regulators of root cell patterning. Their activity intersects with master regulators of meristematic activity, including phytohormones. In this review, we discuss the latest findings about the activity of miRNAs and their interaction with other molecular networks in the formation of root meristem axes. Furthermore, we describe how these small molecules allow root growth to adapt to changes in the environment, while maintaining the correct patterning.
