Elongation of the mesocotyl and coleoptile facilitates the emergence of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) seedlings from soil and is affected by various genetic and environment factors. The regulatory mechanism underlying this process remains largely unclear. Here, we examined the regulation of mesocotyl and coleoptile growth by characterizing a <i>gaoyao1</i> (<i>gy1</i>) mutant that exhibits a longer mesocotyl and longer coleoptile than its original variety of rice. <i>GY1</i> was identified through map-based cloning and encodes a PLA<sub>1</sub>-type phospholipase that localizes in chloroplasts. GY1 functions at the initial step of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis to repress mesocotyl and coleoptile elongation in etiolated rice seedlings. Ethylene inhibits the expression of <i>GY1</i> and other genes in the JA biosynthesis pathway to reduce JA levels and enhance mesocotyl and coleoptile growth by promoting cell elongation. Genetically, <i>GY1</i> acts downstream of the OsEIN2-mediated ethylene signaling pathway to regulate mesocotyl/coleoptile growth. Through analysis of the resequencing data from 3000 rice accessions, we identified a single natural variation of the <i>GY1</i> gene, <i>GY1<sup>376T</sup></i> , which contributes to mesocotyl elongation in rice varieties. Our study reveals novel insights into the regulatory mechanism of mesocotyl/coleoptile elongation and should have practical applications in rice breeding programs.
