Salt tolerance is an important mechanism by which plants can adapt to a saline environment. To understand the process of salt tolerance, we performed global analyses of mRNA alternative polyadenylation (APA), an important regulatory mechanism during eukaryotic gene expression, in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and its halophytic relative <i>Eutrema salsugineum</i> with regard to their responses to salt stress. Analyses showed that while APA occurs commonly in both <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Eutrema</i>, <i>Eutrema</i> possesses fewer APA genes than <i>Arabidopsis</i> (47% vs. 54%). However, the proportion of APA genes was significantly increased in <i>Arabidopsis</i> under salt stress but not in <i>Eutrema</i>. This indicated that <i>Arabidopsis</i> is more sensitive to salt stress and that <i>Eutrema</i> exhibits an innate response to such conditions. Both species utilized distal poly(A) sites under salt stress; however, only eight genes were found to overlap when their 3' untranslated region (UTR) lengthen genes were compared, thus revealing their distinct responses to salt stress. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, genes that use distal poly(A) sites were enriched in response to salt stress. However, in <i>Eutrema</i>, the use of poly(A) sites was less affected and fewer genes were enriched. The transcripts with upregulated poly(A) sites in <i>Arabidopsis</i> showed enriched pathways in plant hormone signal transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism, and fatty acid elongation; in <i>Eutrema</i>, biosynthetic pathways (stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol) and metabolic pathways (arginine and proline) showed enrichment. APA was associated with 42% and 29% of the differentially expressed genes (DE genes) in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Eutrema</i> experiencing salt stress, respectively. Salt specific poly(A) sites and salt-inducible APA events were identified in both species; notably, some salt tolerance-related genes and transcription factor genes exhibited differential APA patterns, such as <i>CIPK21</i> and <i>LEA4-5</i>. Our results suggest that adapted species exhibit more orderly response at the RNA maturation step under salt stress, while more salt-specific poly(A) sites were activated in <i>Arabidopsis</i> to cope with salinity conditions. Collectively, our findings not only highlight the importance of APA in the regulation of gene expression in response to salt stress, but also provide a new perspective on how salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant species perform differently under stress conditions through transcriptome diversity.
