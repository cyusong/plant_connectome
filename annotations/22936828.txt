Polyamines (PAs) are nitrogenous molecules which play a well-established role in most cellular processes during growth and development under physiological or biotic/abiotic stress conditions. The molecular mode(s) of PA action have only recently started to be unveiled, and comprehensive models for their molecular interactions have been proposed. Their multiple roles are exerted, at least partially, through signalling by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), which is generated by the oxidation/back-conversion of PAs by copper amine oxidases and PA oxidases. Accumulating evidence suggests that in plants the cellular titres of PAs are affected by other nitrogenous compounds. Here, we discuss the state of the art on the possible nitrogen flow in PAs, their interconnection with nitrogen metabolism, as well as the signalling roles of PA-derived H(2)O(2) during some developmental processes and stress responses.
