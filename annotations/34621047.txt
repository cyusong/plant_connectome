Plants live as sessile organisms with large-scale gene duplication events and subsequent paralogue divergence during evolution. Notably, plant paralogues are expressed tissue-specifically and fine-tuned by phytohormones during various developmental processes. The coat protein complex II (COPII) is a highly conserved vesiculation machinery mediating protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus in eukaryotes<sup>1</sup>. Intriguingly, Arabidopsis COPII paralogues greatly outnumber those in yeast and mammals<sup>2-6</sup>. However, the functional diversity and underlying mechanism of distinct COPII paralogues in regulating protein endoplasmic reticulum export and coping with various adverse environmental stresses are poorly understood. Here we characterize a novel population of COPII vesicles produced in response to abscisic acid, a key phytohormone regulating abiotic stress responses in plants. These hormone-induced giant COPII vesicles are regulated by an Arabidopsis-specific COPII paralogue and carry stress-related channels/transporters for alleviating stresses. This study thus provides a new mechanism underlying abscisic acid-induced stress responses via the giant COPII vesicles and answers a long-standing question on the evolutionary significance of gene duplications in Arabidopsis.
