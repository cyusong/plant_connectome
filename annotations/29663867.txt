The pepper Pvr4 protein encoding coiled-coil (CC) nucleotide-binding (NB) leucine-rich repeat (LRR) (NLR) confer hypersensitive response (HR) to potyviruses, including Pepper mottle virus (PepMoV), by recognizing the viral avirulence protein NIb. To figure out the Pvr4-mediated HR mechanism, we analyzed signaling component genes and structure-function relationships of Pvr4, using chimeras and deletion mutants in Nicotiana benthamiana. Molecular chaperone components including HSP90, SGT1, and RAR1 were required, while plant hormones and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling components had little effect on Pvr4-NIb-mediated HR cell death. Domain swap analyses indicated that the LRR domain of Pvr4 determines recognition of PepMoV-NIb. Our deletion analysis further revealed that the CC domain or CC-NBARC domain alone can trigger autoactive cell death in N. benthamiana. However, the fragments having only an LRR domain could suppress CC-NBARC domain-induced cell death in trans. Further, C-terminal truncation analysis of Pvr4 revealed that a minimum three of five LRR exons showing high similarity was essential for Pvr4 function. The LRR domain may maintain Pvr4 in an inactive state in the absence of NIb. These results provide further insight into the structure and function of NLR protein signaling in plants.
