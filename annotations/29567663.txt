['29567663', 'Since phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plants, plants have evolved a  number of adaptive mechanisms to respond to changes in phosphate (Pi) supply.  Previously, we reported that the transcription factor WRKY6 modulates Pi  homeostasis by downregulating PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1) expression and that WRKY6 is  degraded during Pi starvation in Arabidopsis thaliana However, the molecular  mechanism underlying low-Pi-induced WRKY6 degradation was unknown. Here, we  report that a ubiquitin E3 ligase, PHOSPHATE RESPONSE UBIQUITIN E3 LIGASE1  (PRU1), modulates WRKY6 protein levels in response to low-Pi stress. A pru1  mutant was more sensitive than the wild type to Pi-deficient conditions,  exhibiting a reduced Pi contents in the shoot, similar to the pho1-2 mutant and  WRKY6-overexpressing line. PRU1 interacted with WRKY6 in vitro and in vivo. Under  low-Pi stress, the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of WRKY6, as well as  the consequential enhancement of PHO1 expression, were impaired in pru1 PRU1  complementation lines displayed no obvious differences compared with wild-type  plants. Further genetic analysis showed that disruption of WRKY6 abolished the  low-Pi sensitivity of pru1, indicating that WRKY6 functioned downstream of PRU1.  Taken together, this study uncovers a mechanism by which PRU1 modulates Pi  homeostasis, through regulating the abundance of WRKY6 in response to low-Pi  stress in Arabidopsis.', '2018 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00845', 'ORCID:']
