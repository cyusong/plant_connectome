Glutathione (GSH) is known to regulate iron (Fe) deficiency response in plants but its involvement in modulating subcellular Fe homoeostasis remains elusive. In this study, we report that the GSH-deficient mutants, cad2-1 and pad2-1 displayed increased sensitivity to Fe deficiency with significant downregulation of the vacuolar Fe exporters, AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4, and the chloroplast Fe importer, AtPIC1. Moreover, the pad2-1 mutant accumulated higher Fe levels in vacuoles but lower Fe levels in chloroplasts compared to wild type (Columbia ecotype [Col-0]) under Fe limited conditions. Exogenous GSH treatment enhanced chloroplast Fe contents in Col-0 but failed to do so in the nramp3nramp4 double mutants demonstrating that GSH plays a role in modulating subcellular Fe homoeostasis. Pharmacological experiments, mutant analysis, and promoter assays revealed that this regulation involves the transcriptional activation of Fe transporter genes by a GSH-S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) module. The Fe responsive bHLH transcription factors (TFs), AtbHLH29, AtbHLH38, and AtbHLH101 were found to interact with the promoters of these genes, which were, in turn, activated via S-nitrosylation (SNO). Taken together, the present study highlights the role of the GSH-GSNO module in regulating subcellular Fe homoeostasis by transcriptional activation of the Fe transporters AtNRAMP3, AtNRAMP4, and AtPIC1 via SNO of bHLH TFs during Fe deficiency.
