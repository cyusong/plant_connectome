The rice leaf mitochondrial DNA is  more methylated compared to the rice grain mitochondrial DNA. The old rice leaf mitochondrial DNA has also a higher methylation level than the young rice leaf mitochondrial DNA. The presence of DNA methylation in rice organelles has not been well characterized. We have previously shown that cytosine methylation of chloroplast DNA is different between leaf and grain, and varies between young and old leaves in rice. However, the variation in cytosine methylation of mitochondrial DNA is still poorly characterized. In this study, we have investigated cytosine methylation of mitochondrial DNA in the rice grain and leaf. Based on CpG, CHG, and CHH methylation analyses, the leaf mitochondrial DNA was found to be  more methylated compared to the grain mitochondrial DNA. The methylation of the leaf mitochondrial DNA was also higher in old compared to young leaves. Differences in methylation were observed at different cytosine positions of the mitochondrial DNA between grain and leaf, although there were also positions with a similar level of high methylation in all the tissues examined. The differentially methylated cytosine positions in rice mitochondrial DNA were observed mostly in the intergenic region and in some mitochondrial-specific genes involved in ATP production, transcription, and translation. The functional importance of cytosine methylation in the life cycle of rice mitochondria is still to be determined.
