['22396764', 'RD21-like proteases are ubiquitous, plant-specific papain-like proteases typified  by carrying a C-terminal granulin domain. RD21-like proteases are involved in  immunity and associated with senescence and various types of biotic and abiotic  stresses. Here, we interrogated Arabidopsis RD21 regulation and trafficking by  site-directed mutagenesis, agroinfiltration, western blotting, protease activity  profiling and protein degradation. Using an introduced N-glycan sensor,  deglycosylation experiments and glyco-engineered N. benthamiana plants, we show  that RD21 passes through the Golgi where it becomes fucosylated. Our studies  demonstrate that RD21 is regulated at three post-translational levels. Prodomain  removal is not blocked in the catalytic Cys mutant, indicating that RD21 is  activated by a proteolytic cascade. However, RD21 activation in Arabidopsis does  not require vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) or aleurain-like protease AALP. In  contrast, granulin domain removal requires the catalytic Cys and His residues and  is therefore autocatalytic. Furthermore, SDS can (re-)activate latent RD21 in  Arabidopsis leaf extracts, indicating the existence of a third layer of  post-translational regulation, possibly mediated by endogenous inhibitors. RD21  causes a dominant protease activity in Arabidopsis leaf extracts, responsible for  SDS-induced proteome degradation.', '2012', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0032422', 'van']
