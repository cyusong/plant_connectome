Drought stress is a major abiotic stress that limits rice yield. Therefore, the development of new varieties tolerant to drought stress is a high priority in breeding programs. In this study, 150 rice M<sub>10</sub> mutant lines, previously developed using gamma-ray irradiation, were used, and a drought-insensitive rice mutant (ditl1) was selected by drought stress screening. The ditl1 mutant exhibited significantly decreased water loss, leaf curling, and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> accumulation under drought stress. Chlorophyll leaching assay and toluidine blue staining suggested lower cuticle permeability in ditl1 mutants than in wild-type (WT) plants. In addition, transmission electron microscopy revealed that ditl1 plants accumulated more cuticular wax on the epidermal surface. Whole-genome resequencing analysis suggested that the deletion of a single nucleotide on the LOC_Os05g48260 gene, a putative ortholog of WSD1 (wax ester synthase/diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase in Arabidopsis), maybe be the gene responsible for the drought insensitive phenotype of ditl1. The ditl1 mutant will be a valuable breeding resource for developing drought stress tolerant rice cultivar.
