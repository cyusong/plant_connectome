The quantitative profile of the biochemicals secreted by summer and winter leaves, present noticeable differences and appear to be qualitatively different from the biochemical profile of the commercially valuable mastic. The anatomy of the root and the primary and secondary shoot as well as that of the summer and winter leaves of P. lentiscus was thoroughly investigated. The secreting network was tracked throughout the plant axis, from the root to the leaves, and the active secreting cells of the duct epithelium were localized, while the secondary metabolites produced within the cells of the summer and winter leaf tissues were identified histochemically. Numerous phytochemicals were identified in the leaf extracts with UHPLC-qTOF MS analysis. The analyzed extracts from summer and winter leaves displayed similar qualitative profile, although quantitative differences were evident, since, during the summer, the leaves tend to synthesize the more complex amongst the identified compounds. The phytochemical profile of the leaf extracts turns to be completely different compared to that of the valuable mastic harvested from the injured trunks. Many of the compounds common in mastic were not detected in the analyzed leaves samples. The numerous secreting ducts either fail to form a unified network, so composition of the secreted material varies in the different organs of the plant or they compose a continuous network, but the biochemical profile of the secreted material differs along the plant axis. Such a detailed investigation of the secretion network of the mastic tree may assist the improvement of the yield and promote the production of valuable phytochemicals through in vitro cultures.
