['12566583', 'Most of the symplastic water transport in plants occurs via aquaporins, but the  extent to which aquaporins contribute to plant water status under favorable  growth conditions and abiotic stress is not clear. To address this issue, we  constitutively overexpressed the Arabidopsis plasma membrane aquaporin, PIP1b, in  transgenic tobacco plants. Under favorable growth conditions, PIP1b  overexpression significantly increased plant growth rate, transpiration rate,  stomatal density, and photosynthetic efficiency. By contrast, PIP1b  overexpression had no beneficial effect under salt stress, whereas during drought  stress it had a negative effect, causing faster wilting. Our results suggest that  symplastic water transport via plasma membrane aquaporins represents a limiting  factor for plant growth and vigor under favorable conditions and that even fully  irrigated plants face limited water transportation. By contrast, enhanced  symplastic water transport via plasma membrane aquaporins may not have any  beneficial effect under salt stress, and it has a deleterious effect during  drought stress.', '2003 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.009225', 'Galili']
