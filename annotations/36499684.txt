Pyruvate kinase (PK) is one of the three rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis, and it plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism. In this study, we have identified 10 PK genes from the rice genome. Initially, these genes were divided into two categories: cytoplasmic pyruvate kinase (PKc) and plastid pyruvate kinase (PKp). Then, an expression analysis revealed that <i>OsPK1</i>, <i>OsPK3</i>, <i>OsPK4</i>, <i>OsPK6</i>, and <i>OsPK9</i> were highly expressed in grains. Moreover, PKs can form heteropolymers. In addition, it was found that ABA significantly regulates the expression of PK genes (<i>OsPK1</i>, <i>OsPK4</i>, <i>OsPK9</i>, and <i>OsPK10</i>) in rice. Intriguingly, all the genes were found to be substantially involved in the regulation of rice grain quality and yield. For example, the disruption of <i>OsPK3</i>, <i>OsPK5</i>, <i>OsPK7</i>, <i>OsPK8</i>, and <i>OsPK10</i> and <i>OsPK4</i>, <i>OsPK5</i>, <i>OsPK6</i>, and <i>OsPK10</i> decreased the 1000-grain weight and the seed setting rate, respectively. Further, the disruption of <i>OsPK4</i>, <i>OsPK6</i>, <i>OsPK8</i>, and <i>OsPK10</i> through the CRISPR/Cas9 system showed an increase in the content of total starch and a decrease in protein content compared to the WT. Similarly, manipulations of the <i>OsPK4</i>, <i>OsPK8</i>, and <i>OsPK10</i> genes increased the amylose content. Meanwhile, the grains of all CRISPR mutants and RNAi lines, except <i>ospk6</i>, showed a significant increase in the chalkiness rate compared to the wild type. Overall, this study characterizes the functions of all the genes of the PK gene family and shows their untapped potential to improve rice yield and quality traits.
