An enzymatically active recombinant protein kinase, previously isolated and characterized in Fagus sylvatica L. dormant seeds (FsPK1), was used to obtain a specific polyclonal antibody against this protein. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis of FsPK1 protein in beech seeds showed a strong immunostaining in the nucleus of the cells located in the vascular tissue of the embryonic axis corresponding to the future apical meristem of the root. This protein kinase was found to accumulate in the seeds only when embryo growth was arrested by application of ABA, while the protein amount decreased during stratification, previously proved to alleviate dormancy, and no protein was detected at all when seed germination was induced by addition of GA(3). These results indicate that FsPK1 may be involved in the control of the embryo growth mediated by ABA and GAs during the transition from dormancy to germination in Fagus sylvatica seeds.
