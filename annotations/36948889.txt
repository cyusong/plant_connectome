Protein lysine acetylation is an important post-translational modification mechanism involved in cellular regulation in eukaryotes. Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor in eukaryotes and is crucial for plant immunity, but it is so far unclear whether acetylation is involved in CaM-mediated plant immunity. Here, we found that GhCaM7 is acetylated upon Verticillium dahliae (V. dahliae) infection and a positive regulator of V. dahliae resistance. Overexpressing GhCaM7 in cotton and Arabidopsis enhances V. dahliae resistance and knocking-down GhCaM7 makes cotton more susceptible to V. dahliae. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing GhCaM7 with mutation at the acetylation site are more susceptible to V. dahliae than transgenics overexpressing the wild-type GhCaM7, implying the importance of the acetylated GhCaM7 in response to V. dahliae infection. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescent complementation, luciferase complementation imaging, and coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated interaction between GhCaM7 and an osmotin protein GhOSM34 that was shown to have a positive role in V. dahliae resistance. GhCaM7 and GhOSM34 are co-localized in the cell membrane. Upon V. dahliae infection, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> content reduces almost instantly in plants with downregulated GhCaM7 or GhOSM34. Down regulating GhOSM34 enhances accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and increases cell osmotic pressure. Comparative transcriptomic analyses between cotton plants with an increased or reduced expression level of GhCaM7 and wild-type plants indicate the involvement of jasmonic acid signaling pathways and reactive oxygen species in GhCaM7-enabled disease resistance. Together, these results demonstrate the involvement of CaM protein in the interaction between cotton and V. dahliae, and more importantly, the involvement of the acetylated CaM in the interaction.
