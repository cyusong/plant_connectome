Based on the genome and small-RNA sequencing of pomegranate, miRNA167 and three target genes <i>PgARF6</i> were identified in "Taishanhong" genome. Three <i>PgARF6</i> genes and their corresponding protein sequences, expression patterns in pomegranate flower development and under exogenous hormones treatments were systematically analyzed in this paper. We found that PgARF6s are nuclear proteins with conserved structures. However, PgARF6s had different protein structures and expression profiles in pomegranate flower development. At the critical stages of pomegranate ovule sterility (8.1-14.0 mm), the expression levels of <i>PgARF6s</i> in bisexual flowers were lower than those in functional male flowers. Interestingly, <i>PgARF6c</i> expression level was significantly higher than <i>PgARF6a</i> and <i>PgARF6b</i>. Under the treatment of exogenous IBA and 6-BA, <i>PgARF6s</i> were down-regulated, and the expression of <i>PgARF6c</i> was significantly inhibited. PgmiR167a and PgmiR167d had the binding site on <i>PgARF6</i> genes sequences, and PgARF6a has the directly targeted regulatory relationship with PgmiR167a in pomegranate. At the critical stage of ovule development (8.1-12.0 mm), exogenous IBA and 6-BA promoted the content of GA and ZR accumulation, inhibited BR accumulation. There was a strong correlation between the expression of <i>PgARF6a</i> and <i>PgARF6b</i>. Under exogenous hormone treatment, the content of ZR, BR, GA, and ABA were negatively correlated with the expressions of <i>PgARF6</i> genes. However, JA was positively correlated with <i>PgARF6a</i> and <i>PgARF6c</i> under IBA treatment. Thus, our results provide new evidence for <i>PgARF6</i> genes involving in ovule sterility in pomegranate flowers.
