The phytochrome family of red (R) and far-red (FR) light receptors (phyA-phyE in Arabidopsis) play important roles throughout plant development and regulate elongation growth during de-etiolation and under light. Phytochromes regulate growth through interaction with the phytohormones gibberellin, auxin, and brassinosteroid. Recently it has been established that jasmonic acid (JA), a phytohormone for stress responses, namely wounding and defence, is also important in inhibition of hypocotyl growth regulated by phyA and phyB. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of the interaction between JA and phytochrome signalling particularly during seedling development in Arabidopsis. Significantly, JA biosynthesis genes are induced by phyA. The protein abundance of JAR1/FIN219, an enzyme for the final synthesis step to give JA-Ile, an active form of JA, is also determined by phyA. In addition, JAR1/FIN219 directly interacts with an E3-ligase, COP1, a master regulator for transcription factors regulating hypocotyl growth, suggesting a more direct role in growth regulation. There are a number of points of interaction in the molecular signalling of JA and phytochrome during seedling development in Arabidopsis, and we propose a model for how they work together to regulate hypocotyl growth.
