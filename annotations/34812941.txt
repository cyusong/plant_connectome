Soybean contains a group of 64 L-type lectin receptor-like kinases. Three LecRKs were involved in the interactions with Phytophthora sojae and Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens. L-type lectin receptor-like kinases (LecRKs) comprise an important class of membrane-localized receptor-like kinases that are involved in plant adaptation. In this study, we performed an inventory analysis of LecRKs in Glycine max (soybean). In total, 64 GmLecRKs containing the canonical LecRK feature were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 48 GmLecRKs have close orthologs in Arabidopsis or Solanum lycopersicum, while 16 are likely present only in the leguminous plant species. Transcriptome analyses revealed that expressions of multiple GmLecRK genes are either induced or suppressed during infection by the soybean root rot pathogen Phytophthora sojae. In addition, overexpression of the three LecRKs (Glyma.17G085000, Glyma.05G041300 or Glyma.17G224600) in the soybean hairy roots enhanced resistance to P. sojae. Upon inoculation with Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens, overexpression of Glyma.17G085000 in the soybean hairy roots does not significantly influence the nodulation, while overexpression of Glyma.05G041300 or Glyma.17G224600 slightly reduced the number and dry weight of nodules. This study highlights the importance of LecRKs in regulating plant-microbe interactions and provides new knowledge on the deployment of LecRKs to increase resistance in soybean.
