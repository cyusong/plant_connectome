This research focused on the different approaches to the transport and internal chelation of metals with amino acids and organic acids in plants. Therefore, in the first phase, the plants studied were identified the characteristics of the bioaccumulation factors. <i>Steria pumila, Echium angustifolium, Typha angustifolia, Sisymbrium austriacum</i> were identified as hyperaccumulators (Cd, Ni), accumulators (Pb, Sn, and Se), excluders (Cr, Hg). On the other hand, the <i>Sisymbrium austriacum</i> only showed the characteristic of the accumulator for Cr. In the second phase, the combined effects of amino acids and organic acids on the chelation of heavy metals in plants were tested by a multi-linear regression model. Related to our hypothesis, Amino acids; Gly and Leu (Cd), Trp and Ile (Pb), Asp, Ser, and Leu (Cr), Ser (Hg), Trp and Glu (Ni), Asp, Thr, and Gly (Sn), Asn and Leu (Se), Organic acids; Malonic and Malic acid (Cd), Malonic acid (Pb), Oxalic and Malic acid (Cr), Oxalic, Succinic, Citric and Butyric acid (Hg), Malonic and Malic acid (Ni), Malonic, Maleic, and Malic acid (Sn), Malonic and Citric acid (Se) were concluded that had combined effect for heavy metal's phytochelation ability into plants.
