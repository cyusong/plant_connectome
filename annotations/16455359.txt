A cDNA-AFLP experiment was designed to identify and clone nucleotide sequences induced during seed germination in Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequences corresponding to known genes involved in processes important for germination, such as mitochondrial biogenesis, protein synthesis and cell cycle progression, were isolated. Other sequences correspond to Arabidopsis BAC clones in regions where genes have not been annotated. Notably, a number of the sequences cloned did not correspond to available sequences in the databases from the Arabidopsis genome, but instead present significant similarity with DNA from other organisms, for example fish species; among them, some may encode transposons. A number of the sequences isolated showed no significant similarity with any sequences in the public databases. Oligonucleotides derived from these new sequences were used to amplify genomic DNA of Arabidopsis. Expression analysis of representative sequences is presented. This work suggests that, during germination, there may be a massive transposon mobilization that may be useful in the annotation of new genome sequences and identification of regulatory mechanisms.
