['30760561', 'DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) represent a severe threat to the genome integrity;  however, the main mechanisms of DPC repair were only recently elucidated in  humans and yeast. Here we define the pathways for DPC repair in plants. Using  CRISPR/Cas9, we could show that only one of two homologs of the universal repair  proteases SPARTAN/ weak suppressor of smt3 (Wss1), WSS1A, is essential for DPC  repair in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). WSS1A defective lines exhibit  developmental defects and are hypersensitive to camptothecin (CPT) and  cis-platin. Interestingly, the CRISPR/Cas9 mutants of TYROSYL-DNA  PHOSPHODIESTERASE 1 (TDP1) are insensitive to CPT, and only the wss1A tdp1 double  mutant reveals a higher sensitivity than the wss1A single mutant. This indicates  that TDP1 defines a minor backup pathway in the repair of DPCs. Moreover, we  found that knock out of the endonuclease METHYL METHANESULFONATE AND UV SENSITIVE  PROTEIN 81 (MUS81) results in a strong sensitivity to DPC-inducing agents. The  fact that wss1A mus81 and tdp1 mus81 double mutants exhibit growth defects and an  increase in dead cells in root meristems after CPT treatment demonstrates that  there are three independent pathways for DPC repair in Arabidopsis. These  pathways are defined by their different biochemical specificities, as main  actors, the DNA endonuclease MUS81 and the protease WSS1A, and the  phosphodiesterase TDP1 as backup.', '2019 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00824', 'ORCID:']
