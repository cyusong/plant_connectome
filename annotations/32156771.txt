Photorespiration is an essential process in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms triggered by the oxygenase activity of Rubisco. In peroxisomes, photorespiratory HYDROXYPYRUVATE REDUCTASE1 (HPR1) catalyzes the conversion of hydroxypyruvate to glycerate together with the oxidation of a pyridine nucleotide cofactor. HPR1 regulation remains poorly understood; however, HPR1 phosphorylation at T335 has been reported. By comparing the kinetic properties of phosphomimetic (T335D), nonphosphorylatable (T335A), and wild-type recombinant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) HPR1, it was found that HPR1-T335D exhibits reduced NADH-dependent hydroxypyruvate reductase activity while showing improved NADPH-dependent activity. Complementation of the Arabidopsis <i>hpr1-1</i> mutant by either wild-type HPR1 or HPR1-T335A fully complemented the photorespiratory growth phenotype of <i>hpr1-1</i> in ambient air, whereas HPR1-T335D-containing <i>hpr1-1</i> plants remained smaller and had lower photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates. Metabolite analyses indicated that these phenotypes were associated with subtle perturbations in the photorespiratory cycle of HPR1-T335D-complemented <i>hpr1-1</i> rosettes compared to all other HPR1-containing lines. Therefore, T335 phosphorylation may play a role in the regulation of HPR1 activity in planta, although it was not required for growth under ambient air controlled conditions. Furthermore, improved NADP-dependent HPR1 activities in peroxisomes could not compensate for the reduced NADH-dependent HPR1 activity.
