Plants contain three classes of hemoglobin genes of which two, class 1 and class 2, have a structure similar to classical vertebrate globins. We investigated the effect of silencing the class 1 non-symbiotic hemoglobin gene, GLB1, and the effect of overexpression of GLB1 or the class 2 non-symbiotic hemoglobin gene, GLB2, in Arabidopsis thaliana. Lines with GLB1 silencing had a significant delay of bolting and after bolting, shoots reverted to the rosette vegetative phase by formation of aerial rosettes at lateral meristems. Lines with overexpression of GLB1 or GLB2 bolted earlier than wild type plants. By germinating the lines in a medium containing the nitric oxide (NO) donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), it was demonstrated that both GLB1 and GLB2 promote bolting by antagonizing the effect of NO, suggesting that non-symbiotic plant hemoglobin controls bolting by scavenging the floral transition signal molecule, NO. So far, NO scavenging has only been demonstrated for class 1 non-symbiotic hemoglobins. A direct assay in Arabidopsis leaf cells shows that GLB1 as well as the class 2 non-symbiotic hemoglobin, GLB2, scavenge NO in vivo. NO has also been demonstrated to be a growth stimulating signal with an optimum at low concentrations. It was observed that overexpression of either GLB1 or GLB2 shifts the optimum for NO growth stimulation to a higher concentration. In conclusion, we have found that expression of NO scavenging plant hemoglobin is involved in the control of bolting in Arabidopsis.
