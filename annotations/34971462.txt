Xylem is the main route for transporting water, minerals and a myriad of signalling molecules within the plant. With its onset during early embryogenesis, the development of the xylem relies on hormone gradients, the activity of unique transcription factors, the distribution of mobile microRNAs, and receptor-ligand pathways. These regulatory mechanisms are often interconnected and together contribute to the plasticity of this water-conducting tissue. Environmental stresses, such as drought and salinity, have a great impact on xylem patterning. A better understanding of how the structural properties of the xylem are regulated in normal and stress conditions will be instrumental in developing crops of the future. In addition, vascular wilt pathogens that attack the xylem are becoming increasingly problematic. Further knowledge of xylem development in response to these pathogens will bring new solutions against these diseases. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the molecular mechanisms of xylem formation that largely come from Arabidopsis research with additional insights from tomato and monocot species. We emphasize the impact of abiotic factors and pathogens on xylem plasticity and the urgent need to uncover the underlying mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the multidisciplinary approach to model xylem capacities in crops.
