['26517126', 'Frataxin plays a key role in eukaryotic cellular iron metabolism, particularly in  mitochondrial heme and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis. However, its  precise role has yet to be elucidated. In this work, we studied the subcellular  localization of Arabidopsis frataxin, AtFH, using confocal microscopy, and found  a novel dual localization for this protein. We demonstrate that plant frataxin is  targeted to both the mitochondria and the chloroplast, where it may play a role  in Fe-S cluster metabolism as suggested by functional studies on nitrite  reductase (NIR) and ferredoxin (Fd), two Fe-S containing chloroplast proteins, in  AtFH deficient plants. Our results indicate that frataxin deficiency alters the  normal functioning of chloroplasts by affecting the levels of Fe, chlorophyll,  and the photosynthetic electron transport chain in this organelle.', '2015', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0141443', 'Gomez-Casati']
