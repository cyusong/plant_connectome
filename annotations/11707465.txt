['11707465', 'PSI-G is a subunit of photosystem I in eukaryotes. The function of PSI-G was  characterized in Arabidopsis plants transformed with a psaG cDNA in antisense  orientation. Several plants with significantly decreased PSI-G protein content  were identified. Plants with reduced PSI-G content were indistinguishable from  wild type when grown under optimal conditions, despite a 40% reduction of  photosystem I. This decrease of photosystem I was correlated with a similar  reduction in state transitions. Surprisingly, the reduced photosystem I content  was compensated for by a more effective photosystem I because the light-dependent  reduction of NADP(+) in vitro was 48% higher. Photosystem I antenna size  determined from flash-induced P700 absorption changes did not reveal any  significant effect on the size of the photosystem I antenna in the absence of  PSI-G, whereas a 17% reduction was seen in the absence of PSI-K. However,  nondenaturing green gels revealed that the interaction between photosystem I and  the light-harvesting complex I was less stable in the absence of PSI-G. Thus,  PSI-G plays a role in stabilizing the binding of the peripheral antenna. The  increased activity in the absence of PSI-G suggests that PSI-G could have an  important role in regulation of photosystem I.', '2002 Jan 25', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M110448200', 'Scheller']
