Chloroplasts play an essential role in plant growth and development. Any factors affecting chloroplast development will lead to abnormal plant growth. Here, we characterized a new maize mutant, <i>albino seedling mutant 81647</i> (<i>as-81647</i>), which exhibits an entirely albino phenotype in leaves and eventually died before the three-leaf stage. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that the chloroplast thylakoid membrane was impaired and the granum lamellae significantly decreased in <i>as-81647</i>. Map-based cloning and transgenic analysis confirmed that <i>PPR647</i> encodes a new chloroplast protein consisting of 11 pentratricopeptide repeat domains. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays and transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) showed that the <i>PPR647</i> mutation significantly disrupted the expression of PEP-dependent plastid genes. In addition, RNA splicing and RNA editing of multiple chloroplast genes showed severe defects in <i>as-81647</i>. These results indicated that PPR647 is crucial for RNA editing, RNA splicing of chloroplast genes, and plays an essential role in chloroplast development.
