Unlike animals, plants possess a non-strict and sometimes very fuzzy morphology. Mutual proportions of plant parts can vary to a much greater extent than in animals, changing according to the environmental conditions and the plant needs of nutrients, water and light. Despite the existence of this fundamental difference between plants and animals, it passes almost non-reflected in most studies on plants. In this review we make a preliminary attempt to gather together the mechanisms by which plants preserve their integrity, not loosing at the same time the physiological (and morphological) flexibility which allows them adapting to the different environments they can populate.
