Saliva miltiorrhiza ethylene response factor (SmERF), predicted to be expressed genome-wide, is the potential regulator of tanshinone biosynthesis. However, few studies have investigated its transcriptional regulation pathways in tanshinone biosynthesis. Here, we report an ethylene response factor (SmERF8), which was screened by the SmKSL1 (a key gene in tanshinone biosynthesis) promoter from the S. miltiorrhiza cDNA library. The SmERF8, highly expressed in S. miltiorrhiza root head, is sensitive to Eth stress, and its protein was enriched in the nucleus. The SmERF8 recognizes the GCC-box in the SmKSL1 promoter. Overexpression and RNAi of SmERF8 in S. miltiorrhiza transgenic hairy roots showed that the tanshinone contents were significantly increased in the overexpression transgenic lines and decreased in RNAi lines. These results suggest that the SmERF8 may be a central activator that regulates the expression of SmKSL1 by binding the GCC-box and then promoting tanshinone biosynthesis. Thus, the SmERF8 may functionally accelerate tanshinone biosynthesis by the transcriptional regulation of its key gene.
