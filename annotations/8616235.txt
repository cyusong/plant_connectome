['8616235', 'Immunoblot analysis with antibodies prepared against highly purified recombinant  truncated kinesin-like proteins, KatB(5-249) and KatC(207-754), encoded by the  katB and katC genes of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed the presence of a  kinesin-like polypeptide, termed KatB/C, in cultured tobacco BY-2 cells. The  KatB/C polypeptide cosedimented with microtubules in the presence of a  nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue and was released from microtubules in the presence  of ATP, both of which are characteristics of kinesin proteins. The amount of  KatB/C polypeptide in synchronous BY-2 cells increased during M phase of the cell  cycle. Microtubule-based structures present in cells at M phase, such as the  spindle and phragmoplast, may be the site of action of the KatB/C protein.', '1996 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/BF00017812', 'Takahashi']
