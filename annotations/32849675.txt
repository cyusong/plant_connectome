The need for plants to defend themselves, communicate, and somehow contribute to the social life in their ecosystems has triggered the evolution of an astonishing number of diverse chemicals, some of which involved in plant-plant interactions. In the present study, specific aspects of allelopathy are investigated. A combination of bioassays and metabolomics was used in order to study the chemical interactions occurring between three donor species of Mediterranean area (<i>Arbutus unedo</i>, <i>Medicago minima</i>, <i>Myrtus communis</i>) and a receiving species (<i>Aegilops geniculata</i>). The biochemical changes occurring in the receiving plant upon the treatments with the donor extracts were studied. Oxidative stress and altered water balance were found to be the major changes in the receiving plant. Putative allelochemicals synthesized by the donor plants were also identified and it was shown that their activity was enhanced by co-occurring metabolites. This study provides evidence that metabolite mixtures are to be taken into consideration for allelopathic activity. Furthermore, not only it reports the chemicals responsible for the activity in the specific system, but it also shows that the response of the receiving plant to the treatment with extracts from donor plants is comparable to the response to other stresses.
