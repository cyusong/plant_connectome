['21269510', 'BACKGROUND: Rab GTPases are important regulators of endomembrane trafficking,  regulating exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane recycling. Many Rab-like proteins  exist in plants, but only a subset have been functionally characterized. RESULTS:  Here we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in pollen  development, germination and tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single  mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared with wild-type plants  across a variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is also  indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however its  siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants. Compared with wild-type  plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched  pollen tube tips. The shorter siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were  found to be primarily due to the pollen defects. AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have  different but overlapping expression patterns, and they are both highly expressed  in pollen. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c protein localize to Golgi bodies.  CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and  AtRabD2c in vesicle trafficking during pollen tube growth that cannot be  fulfilled by the remaining AtRabD family members.', '2011 Jan 26', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-11-25', 'Bassham']
