Volatile benzenoids/phenylpropanoids are characteristic scent compounds in petunia flowers and are reported to be stored as glycosides in the vacuoles of petal cells. Here, we used transcriptomics and co-expression approaches with volatile benzenoid/phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes to identify three petunia genes (UGT85A96, UGT85A97, and UGT85A98) encoding UDP-glycosyltransferase. The analyses of spatiotemporal gene expression revealed that all UGT85 genes were highly expressed in floral tissues such as petals and pistils. Functional characterization of recombinant UGT85A96 and UGT85A98 proteins expressed in Escherichia coli showed that UGT85A98 could transfer a glucosyl moiety from UDP-glucose to the hydroxyl group of various substrates including volatile benzenoids/phenylpropanoids, terpene alcohol, flavonoids, and C6 alcohol, whereas UGT85A96 specifically catalyzes the glucosylation of 2-phenylethanol and benzyl alcohol. This report describes the first experimental evidence to identify UGT enzymes that catalyze the glycosylation of volatile benzenoids/phenylpropanoids in petunia flowers.
