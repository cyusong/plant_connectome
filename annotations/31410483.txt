Auxin is a phytohormone that plays an important role in plant growth and development by forming local concentration gradients. The regulation of auxin levels is determined by the activity of auxin efflux carrier protein PIN-formed (PIN). In Arabidopsis thaliana, PIN-formed1 (PIN1) functions in inflorescence and root development. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), there are four PIN1 homologs (OsPIN1a-1d), but their functions remain largely unexplored. Hence, in this study, we created mutant alleles of PIN1 gene-pin1a, pin1b, pin1c, pin1d, pin1a pin1b and pin1c pin1d- using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and used them to study the functions of the four OsPIN1 paralogs in rice. In wild-type rice, all four OsPIN1 genes were relatively highly expressed in the root than in other tissues. Compared with the wild type, the OsPIN1 single mutants had no dramatic phenotypes, but the pin1a pin1b double mutant had shorter shoots and primary roots, fewer crown roots, reduced root gravitropism, longer root hairs and larger panicle branch angle. Furthermore, the pin1c pin1d double mutant showed no observable phenotype at the seedling stage, but showed naked, pin-shape inflorescence at flowering. These data suggest that OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation. Our study provides basic knowledge that will facilitate the study of auxin transport and signaling in rice.
