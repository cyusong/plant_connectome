Reversible protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases is a major form of posttranslational regulation that plays a central role in regulating many signaling pathways. While large families of both protein kinases and protein phosphatases have been identified in plants, kinases outnumber phosphatases. This raises the question of how a relatively limited number of protein phosphatases can maintain protein phosphorylation homeostasis in a cell. Recent studies have shown that Arabidopsis FyPP1 (Phytochrome-associated serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1) and FyPP3 encode the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), and that they directly binds to the A subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2AA proteins), and SAL (SAPS domain-like) proteins to form the heterotrimeric PP6 holoenzyme complex. Emerging evidence is suggesting that PP6, acts in opposition with multiple classes of kinases, to regulate the phosphorylation status of diverse substrates and subsequently numerous developmental processes and responses to environmental stimuli.
