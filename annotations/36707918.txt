Plant embryogenesis results from the fusion of male and female gametes but can also be induced in somatic cells. The molecular pathways for embryo initiation are poorly understood, especially in monocots. In rice, the male gamete expressed BABY BOOM1 (OsBBM1) transcription factor functions as an embryogenic trigger in the zygote and can also promote somatic embryogenesis when ectopically expressed in somatic tissues. We used gene editing, transcriptome profiling, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine the molecular players involved in embryo initiation downstream of OsBBM1. We identify OsYUCCA (OsYUC) auxin biosynthesis genes as direct targets of OsBBM1. Unexpectedly, these OsYUC targets in zygotes are expressed only from the maternal genome, whereas the paternal genome exclusively provides functional OsBBM1 to initiate embryogenesis. Induction of somatic embryogenesis by exogenous auxin requires OsBBM genes and downstream OsYUC targets. Ectopic OsBBM1 initiates somatic embryogenesis without exogenous auxins but requires functional OsYUC genes. Thus, an OsBBM-OsYUC module is a key player for both somatic and zygotic embryogenesis in rice. Zygotic embryo initiation involves a partnership of male and female genomes, through which paternal OsBBM1 activates maternal OsYUC genes. In somatic embryogenesis, exogenous auxin triggers OsBBM1 expression, which then activates endogenous auxin biosynthesis OsYUC genes.
