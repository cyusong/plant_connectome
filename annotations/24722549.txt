['24722549', 'Fatty acids (FAs) and FA-derived complex lipids play important roles in plant  growth and vegetative development and are a class of prominent metabolites stored  in mature seeds. The factors and regulatory networks that control FA accumulation  in plant seeds remain largely unknown. The role of TRANSPARENT TESTA8 (TT8) in  the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis and the formation of seed coat color is  extensively studied; however, its function in affecting seed FA biosynthesis is  poorly understood. In this article, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) TT8 acts maternally to affect seed FA biosynthesis and inhibits seed FA  accumulation by down-regulating a group of genes either critical to embryonic  development or important in the FA biosynthesis pathway. Moreover, the tt8  mutation resulted in reduced deposition of protein in seeds during maturation.  Posttranslational activation of a TT8-GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR fusion protein and  chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TT8 represses the  activities of LEAFY COTYLEDON1, LEAFY COTYLEDON2, and FUSCA3, the critical  transcriptional factors important for seed development, as well as  CYTIDINEDIPHOSPHATE DIACYLGLYCEROL SYNTHASE2, which mediates glycerolipid  biosynthesis. These results help us to understand the entire function of TT8 and  increase our knowledge of the complicated networks regulating the formation of  FA-derived complex lipids in plant seeds.', '2014 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.235507', 'ORCID:']
