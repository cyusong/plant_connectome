Different tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) mutants, affected in flowering time, reproductive structure or plant architecture, were crossed to produce double mutants in order to investigate gene interactions in flowering regulation in this autonomous species with a sympodial growth habit. The compound inflorescence: uniflora, uniflora: self pruning, uniflora: blind, and jointless: uniflora double mutants all produced solitary flowers like their uniflora parent, instead of inflorescences. All double mutants were late flowering. uniflora: blind and uniflora: self pruning had flowering times intermediate between those of their two parents. jointless: uniflora and compound inflorescence: uniflora flowered later than uniflora, the mutant with the most delayed flowering. All double mutants developed strong lateral shoots at node levels approximately corresponding to the level at which their parent cultivars initiated their first reproductive structure, which is a typical trait of uniflora. These results suggest that the UNIFLORA gene acts upstream of the other investigated genes in controlling flowering in tomato, and that floral transition of the primary shoot and floral transition of sympodial segments are regulated differently.
