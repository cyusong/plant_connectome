Female gametophyte (FG) is crucial for reproduction in flowering plants. Arabidopsis thaliana produces Polygonum-type FGs, which consist of an egg cell, two synergid cells, three antipodal cells and a central cell. Egg cell and central cell are the two female gametes that give rise to the embryo and surrounding endosperm, respectively, after fertilization. During the development of a FG, a single megaspore produced by meiosis undergoes three rounds of mitosis to produce an eight-nucleate cell. A seven-celled FG is formed after cellularization. The central cell initially contains two polar nuclei that fuse during female gametogenesis to form the secondary nucleus. In this study, we developed a gene induction system for analyzing the functions of various genes in developing Arabidopsis FGs. This system allows transgene expression in developing FGs using the heat-inducible Cre-loxP recombination system and FG-specific embryo sac 2 (ES2) promoter. Efficient gene induction was achieved in FGs by incubating flower buds and isolated pistils at 35ï¿½C for short periods of time (1-5 min). Gene induction was also induced in developing FGs by heat treatment of isolated ovules using the infrared laser-evoked gene operator (IR-LEGO) system. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Sad1/UNC84 (SUN) proteins in developing FGs using the gene induction system developed in this study caused defects in polar nuclear fusion, indicating the roles of SUN proteins in this process. This strategy represents a new tool for analyzing the functions of genes in FG development and FG functions.
