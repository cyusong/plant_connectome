In plants, flowering time is elaborately controlled by various environment factors. Ultimately, florigens such as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) or FT-like molecules induce flowering. In rice (Oryza sativa), Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) is a major inducer of florigen gene expression. Although Ehd1 is highly homologous to the type-B response regulator (RR) family in the cytokinin signaling pathway, its precise molecular mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we showed that the C-terminal portion of the protein containing the GARP DNA-binding (G) domain can promote flowering when overexpressed. We also observed that the N-terminal portion of Ehd1, carrying the receiver (R) domain, delays flowering by inhibiting endogenous Ehd1 activity. Ehd1 protein forms a homomer via a 16-amino acid region in the inter domain between R and G. From the site-directed mutagenesis analyses, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of the Asp-63 residue within the R domain induces the homomerization of Ehd1, which is crucial for Ehd1 activity. A type-A RR, OsRR1, physically interacts with Ehd1 to form a heterodimer. In addition, OsRR1-overexpressing plants show a late-flowering phenotype. Based on these observations, we conclude that OsRR1 inhibits Ehd1 activity by binding to form an inactive complex.
