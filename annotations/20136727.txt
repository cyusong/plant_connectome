['20136727', 'Autophagic recycling of intracellular plant constituents is maintained at a basal  level under normal growth conditions but can be induced in response to  nutritional demand, biotic stress, and senescence. One route requires the  ubiquitin-fold proteins Autophagy-related (ATG)-8 and ATG12, which become  attached to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and the ATG5 protein,  respectively, during formation of the engulfing vesicle and delivery of its cargo  to the vacuole for breakdown. Here, we genetically analyzed the conjugation  machinery required for ATG8/12 modification in Arabidopsis thaliana with a focus  on the two loci encoding ATG12. Whereas single atg12a and atg12b mutants lack  phenotypic consequences, atg12a atg12b double mutants senesce prematurely, are  hypersensitive to nitrogen and fixed carbon starvation, and fail to accumulate  autophagic bodies in the vacuole. By combining mutants eliminating ATG12a/b,  ATG5, or the ATG10 E2 required for their condensation with a method that  unequivocally detects the ATG8-PE adduct, we also show that ATG8 lipidation  requires the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate. Unlike ATG8, ATG12 does not associate with  autophagic bodies, implying that its role(s) during autophagy is restricted to  events before the vacuolar deposition of vesicles. The expression patterns of the  ATG12a and ATG12b genes and the effects of single atg12a and atg12b mutants on  forming the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate reveal that the ATG12b locus is more important  during basal autophagy while the ATG12a locus is more important during induced  autophagy. Taken together, we conclude that the formation of the ATG12-ATG5  adduct is essential for ATG8-mediated autophagy in plants by promoting ATG8  lipidation.', '2010 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04166.x', 'Vierstra']
