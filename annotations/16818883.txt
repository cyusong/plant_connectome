['16818883', 'The biogenesis of the photosynthetic thylakoid membranes inside plant  chloroplasts requires enzymes at the plastid envelope and the endoplasmic  reticulum (ER). Extensive lipid trafficking is required for thylakoid lipid  biosynthesis. Here the trigalactosyldiacylglycerol2 (tgd2) mutant of Arabidopsis  is described. To the extent tested, tgd2 showed a complex lipid phenotype  identical to the previously described tgd1 mutant. The aberrant accumulation of  oligogalactolipids and triacylglycerols and the reduction of molecular species of  galactolipids derived from the ER are consistent with a disruption of the import  of ER-derived lipids into the plastid. The TGD1 protein is a permease-like  component of an ABC transporter located in the chloroplast inner envelope  membrane. The TGD2 gene encodes a phosphatidic acid-binding protein with a  predicted mycobacterial cell entry domain. It is tethered to the inner  chloroplast envelope membrane facing the outer envelope membrane. Presumed  bacterial orthologs of TGD1 and TGD2 in Gram-negative bacteria are typically  organized in transcriptional units, suggesting their involvement in a common  biological process. Expression of the tgd2-1 mutant cDNA caused a  dominant-negative effect replicating the tgd2 mutant phenotype. This result is  interpreted as the interference of the mutant protein with its native protein  complex. It is proposed that TGD2 represents the substrate-binding or regulatory  component of a phosphatidic acid/lipid transport complex in the chloroplast inner  envelope membrane.', '2006 Jul 11', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0602754103', 'Benning']
