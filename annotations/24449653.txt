Changes in the cytosolic Ca(2+) levels and the role of Ca(2+) signal transduction in neutral lipid synthesis in Chlorella sp. C2 under nitrogen starvation conditions were investigated. The results detected by using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique demonstrate that nitrogen starvation induced significant Ca(2+) influx across the plasma membrane into cells. Ca(2+) fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry were used to estimate the effect of this Ca(2+) influx on the generation of the Ca(2+) signal, and the results showed that the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration increased transiently and then remained at a stable, high level when the cells were exposed to nitrogen starvation. However, the increase could be inhibited by pre-treatment with the Ca(2+) channel blockers ruthenium red, verapamil and GdCl3, indicating that both the influx of Ca(2+) from the extracellular space via Ca(2+) channels that are localized in the plasma membrane and the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular calcium storage via the internal calcium store were required for the generation and transduction of the Ca(2+) signal. During nitrogen starvation, neutral lipid synthesis in Chlorella sp. C2 in response to stress conditions was also inhibited to differing degrees by pre-treatment with the three Ca(2+) channel blockers, demonstrating the regulation of Ca(2+) via these Ca(2+) channels in neutral lipid synthesis. The results suggested that by transduction of extracellular stress signals into the cell and the regulation of the Ca(2+) signal in neutral lipid synthesis, Ca(2+) signal transduction played important roles in the response mechanism of Chlorella sp. C2 to nitrogen starvation.
