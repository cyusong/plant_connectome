The cucumber anthracnose fungus Colletotrichum orbiculare forms a specialized infection structure, called an appressorium. Appressorium differentiation relies on fungal perception of physical and biochemical signals at the plant surface. Our previous report showed that the morphogenesis-related NDR (nuclear Dbf2-related) kinase pathway (MOR) is crucial for translating plant-derived signals for appressorium development. Here, we focused on identifying transcriptional regulators downstream of MOR that are involved in plant signal sensing and transduction for appressorium development. Based on whole-genome transcript profiling, we identified a Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> transcription factor, CoMTF4, as a potential downstream factor of MOR. CoMTF4 was expressed in planta rather than in vitro under the control of the NDR kinase CoCbk1. Phenotypes of comtf4 mutants, strains with constitutively active CoCbk1 and strains with constitutive overexpression of CoMTF4 suggested that CoMtf4 acts downstream of MOR. Furthermore, nuclear localization of CoMtf4 was dependent on the MOR and responsive to plant-derived signals that lead to appressorium morphogenesis. Thus, we conclude that CoMtf4 is a transcription factor downstream of MOR that is essential for appressorium morphogenesis and pathogenesis and is regulated in response to plant-derived signals. This study provides insights into fungal sensing of plant signals and subsequent responses critical for appressorium formation.
