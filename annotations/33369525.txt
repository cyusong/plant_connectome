We identified a <i>rapid cell death 2</i> (<i>rcd2</i>) mutant from an indica cultivar Zhongjian100 mutant bank. The red-brown lesions appeared firstly on young seedling leaves, then gradually merged and the leaves completely withered at the late tillering stage. <i>rcd2</i> displayed apparent cell death at/around the lesions, accumulation of superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and disturbed ROS scavenging system, impaired photosynthetic capacity with significantly reduced chlorophyll content. The lesion formation was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene and induced by natural light as well as mechanical wounding. A single base mutation (A1726T) at the 6th exon of <i>OsMH_03G0040800</i> resulted in I576F substitution in the encoding protein, pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO). Functional complementation could rescue the mutant phenotype and <i>PAO-</i>knockout lines exhibited the similar phenotype to <i>rcd2</i>. The activity of PAO decreased significantly while the content of PAO substrate, pheophorbide a, increased apparently in <i>rcd2</i>. The expression of chlorophyll synthesis/degradation-related genes and the contents of metabolic intermediates were largely changed. Furthermore, the level of chlorophyllide a, the product of chlorophyllase, increased significantly, indicating chlorophyllase might play a role in chlorophyll degradation in rice. Our results suggested that the I576F substitution disrupted PAO function, leading to O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> accumulation and chlorophyll degradation breakdown in rice.
