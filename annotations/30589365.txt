Stress-associated proteins (SAPs) are A20 and AN1 domain-containing proteins, some of which play important roles in plant stress signaling. Here, we report the involvement of tomato <i>SlSAP</i> family in immunity. <i>SlSAP</i>s responded with different expression patterns to <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and defense signaling hormones. Virus-induced gene silencing of each of the <i>SlSAP</i> genes and disease assays revealed that <i>SlSAP4</i> and <i>SlSAP10</i> play roles in immunity against <i>B. cinerea</i>. Silencing of <i>SlSAP4</i> resulted in attenuated immunity to <i>B. cinerea</i>, accompanying increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species and downregulated expression of jasmonate and ethylene (JA/ET) signaling-responsive defense genes. Transient expression of <i>SlSAP4</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> led to enhanced resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i>. Exogenous application of methyl jasmonate partially restored the resistance of the <i>SlSAP4</i>-silenced plants against <i>B. cinerea</i>. SlSAP4 interacted with three of four SlRAD23 proteins. The A20 domain in SlSAP4 and the Ub-associated domains in SlRAD23d are critical for SlSAP4-SlRAD23d interaction. Silencing of <i>SlRAD23d</i> led to decreased resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i>, but silencing of each of other <i>SlRAD23s</i> did not affect immunity against <i>B. cinerea</i>. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlSAP4</i> and each of the <i>SlRAD23</i>s did not affect immunity to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000. These data suggest that SlSAP4 contributes positively to tomato immunity against <i>B. cinereal</i> through affecting JA/ET signaling and may be involved in the substrate ubiquitination process via interacting with SlRAD23d.
