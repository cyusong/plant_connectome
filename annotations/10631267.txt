['10631267', 'The 14-3-3 proteins are acidic, dimeric proteins that have been implicated in  many eukaryotic cellular processes because of direct protein association with  enzymes and other metabolic and regulatory proteins. 14-3-3 proteins are largely  considered to be cytoplasmic, but a search for proteins that specifically  interact with a plant 14-3-3 resulted in the isolation of a nuclear-encoded,  thylakoid-targeted chloroplast precursor, the full-length Arabidopsis photosystem  I N-subunit At pPSI-N (P.C. Sehnke, R.J. Ferl  inverted question mark1995 Plant Physiol 109: 1126).  Using precursor truncations in the two-hybrid system, it was determined that the  leader sequence is the site of PSI-N that associates with 14-3-3. This suggested  the novel possibility that 14-3-3 would be found within chloroplasts.  Immuno-electron microscopy of leaf tissue and western analysis of chloroplast  fractions with monoclonal anti-14-3-3 antibodies localized 14-3-3 proteins to the  chloroplast stroma and the stromal side of thylakoid membranes. Using  peptide-generated, isoform-specific antibodies, GF14nu, GF14epsilon, GF14mu, and  GF14upsilon were shown to be present in the chloroplast stromal extract. These  isoforms represent two distinct phylogenetic 14-3-3 groupings. These data suggest  a novel interorganellar role for these phylogenetically distinct 14-3-3 proteins.', '2000 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.122.1.235', 'Ferl']
