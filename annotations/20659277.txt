['20659277', "The glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate antiporter GPT1 is a major route of entry of  carbon into non-photosynthetic plastids. To discover its importance in oilseeds,  we used a seed-specific promoter to generate lines of Arabidopsis thaliana with  reduced levels of GPT1 in developing embryos. Strong reductions resulted in seed  abortion at the end of the globular stage of embryo development, when proplastids  in normal embryos differentiate and acquire chlorophyll. Seed abortion was partly  dependent on the light level during silique development. Embryos in seeds  destined for abortion failed to undergo normal morphogenesis and were  'raspberry-like' in appearance. They had ultrastructural and biochemical defects  including proliferation of peroxisomes and starch granules, and altered  expression of genes involved in starch turnover and the oxidative pentose  phosphate pathway. We propose that GPT1 is necessary for early embryo development  because it catalyses import into plastids of glucose-6-phosphate as the substrate  for NADPH generation via the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. We suggest that  low NADPH levels during plastid differentiation and chlorophyll synthesis may  result in generation of reactive oxygen species and triggering of embryo cell  death.", '2010 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04313.x', 'Smith']
