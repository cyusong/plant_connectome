There is potential sources of alleles and genes currently locked into wheat-related species that could be introduced into wheat breeding programs for current and future hot and dry climates. However, neither the intra- nor the inter-specific diversity of the responses of leaf growth and transpiration to temperature and evaporative demand have been investigated in a large diversity of wheat-related species. By analysing 12 groups of wheat-related sub-species, we questioned the n-dimensional structure of the genetic diversity for traits linked to plant vegetative structures and development, leaf expansion and transpiration together with their responses to "non-stressing" range of temperature and evaporative demand. In addition to provide new insight on how genome type, ploidy level, phylogeny and breeding pressure together structure this genetic diversity, this study provides new mathematical formalisms and the associated parameters of trait responses in the large genetic diversity of wheat-related species. This potentially allow crop models predicting the impact of this diversity on yield, and indicate potential sources of varietal improvement for modern wheat germplasms, through interspecific crosses.
