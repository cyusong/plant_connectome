*An integrated approach has been used to obtain an understanding of the molecular and chemical mechanisms underlying resistance to aphids in cherry-like tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) landraces from the Campania region (southern Italy). The aphid-parasitoid system Macrosiphum euphorbiae-Aphidius ervi was used to describe the levels of resistance against aphids in two tomato accessions (AN5, AN7) exhibiting high yield and quality traits and lacking the tomato Mi gene. *Aphid development and reproduction, flight response by the aphid parasitoid A. ervi, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry headspace analysis of plant volatile organic compounds and transcriptional analysis of aphid responsive genes were performed on selected tomato accessions and on a susceptible commercial variety (M82). *When compared with the cultivated variety, M82, AN5 and AN7 showed a significant reduction of M. euphorbiae fitness, the release of larger amounts of specific volatile organic compounds that are attractive to the aphid parasitoid A. ervi, a constitutively higher level of expression of plant defence genes and differential enhancement of plant indirect resistance induced by aphid feeding. *These results provide new insights on how local selection can offer the possibility of the development of innovative genetic strategies to increase tomato resistance against aphids.
