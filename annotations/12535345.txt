['12535345', 'Arabidopsis contains eight actin genes. Of these ACT7 is the most strongly  expressed in young plant tissues and shows the greatest response to physiological  cues. Adult plants homozygous for the act7 mutant alleles show no obvious  above-ground phenotypes, which suggests a high degree of functional redundancy  among plant actins. However, act7-1 mutant plants are at a strong selective  disadvantage when grown in competition with wild-type plants and therefore must  have undetected physical defects. The act7-1 and act7-4 alleles contain T-DNA  insertions just after the stop codon and within the first intron, respectively.  Homozygous mutant seedlings of both alleles showed less than 7% of normal ACT7  protein levels. Mutants displayed delayed and less efficient germination,  increased root twisting and waving, and retarded root growth. The act7-4 mutant  showed the most dramatic reduction in root growth. The act7-4 root apical cells  were not in straight files and contained oblique junctions between cells  suggesting a possible role for ACT7 in determining cell polarity. Wild-type root  growth was fully restored to the act7-1 mutant by the addition of an exogenous  copy of the ACT7 gene. T-DNA insertions just downstream of the major  polyadenylation sites (act7-2, act7-3) appeared fully wild type. The act7 mutant  phenotypes demonstrate a significant requirement for functional ACT7 protein  during root development and explain the strong negative selection component seen  for the act7-1 mutant.', '2003 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01626.x', 'Meagher']
