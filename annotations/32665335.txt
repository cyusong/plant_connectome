Rho of Plants (ROP) G-proteins are key components of cell polarization processes in plant development. The barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) ROP protein RACB is a susceptibility factor in the interaction of barley with the barley powdery mildew fungus <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i> (<i>Bgh</i>). RACB also drives polar cell development, and this function might be coopted during the formation of fungal haustoria in barley epidermal cells. To understand RACB signaling during the interaction of barley with <i>Bgh</i>, we searched for potential downstream interactors of RACB. Here, we show that ROP INTERACTIVE PARTNER b (RIPb; synonym: INTERACTOR OF CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVE ROP b) directly interacts with RACB in yeast and in planta. Overexpression of RIPb supports the susceptibility of barley to <i>Bgh</i> RIPb further interacts with itself at microtubules. However, the interaction with activated RACB largely takes place at the plasma membrane. Both RIPb and RACB are recruited to the site of fungal attack around the neck of developing haustoria, suggesting locally enhanced ROP activity. We further assigned different functions to different domains of the RIPb protein. The N-terminal coiled-coil CC1 domain is required for microtubule localization, while the C-terminal coiled-coil CC2 domain is sufficient to interact with RACB and to fulfill a function in susceptibility at the plasma membrane. Hence, RIPb appears to be localized at microtubules and is then recruited by activated RACB for a function at the plasma membrane during formation of the haustorial complex.
