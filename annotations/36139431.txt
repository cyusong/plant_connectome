['36139431', 'Intercellular material transport and information transmission in plants are  carried out through the plasmodesmata (PD). The amount of callose around the PD  controls channel permeability. In plants, beta-1,3-glucanase can degrade callose and  affect plant growth and development. In this study, the gene producing  PD-localized beta-1,3-glucanase and regulating the leaf trichomes is identified and  named PdBG4. Based on functional analysis through a series of genetic  manipulation assays, we found that the high expression of PdBG4 was associated  with strong PD permeability and short Arabidopsis thaliana leaf trichomes.  Conversely, the low expression of PdBG4 correlated with weak PD permeability and  long Arabidopsis thaliana leaf trichomes. This study revealed that the PdBG4 gene  negatively modulates leaf trichome growth and development by regulating PD  permeability.', '2022 Sep 13', 'Cells', '10.3390/cells11182856', 'ORCID:']
