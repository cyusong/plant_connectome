['9276952', 'Aquaporins, proteins that enhance the permeability of biological membranes to  water, are widely distributed in living organisms. They are 26- to 29-kD proteins  that belong to the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family of channels. By searching  the Arabidopsis thaliana expressed sequence tag database and by using the  polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides to conserved plant aquaporin  domains, we identified 23 expressed Arabidopsis MIP genes. Eight of these had  been previously identified as active aquaporins, and two additional ones are now  reported to have water-transport activity in Xenopus laevis oocytes. One of these  is highly expressed in suspension-cultured cells. On a dendrogram these 23 MIP  sequences cluster into three groups: the first group has 11 members and contains  the plasma membrane aquaporins, the second group also has 11 members and contains  the tonoplast aquaporins, and the third group has only a single member. This MIP  protein, provisionally called At-NLM1, is most closely related to the Gm-NOD26  protein that is found in the bacteroid membranes of soybean (Glycine max L.)  nodules; At-NLM1 is an active aquaporin when expressed in oocytes. With a  semiquantitative slot-blot analysis technique, we determined the expression  levels of 22 MIP genes in the various organs. The quantitative polymerase chain  reaction was used to determine the effects of various stress treatments on the  expression of NLM1.', '1997 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.4.1347', 'Chrispeels']
