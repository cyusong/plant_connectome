['29659022', 'Leaf senescence is a key process in plants that culminates in the degradation of  cellular constituents and massive reprogramming of metabolism for the recovery of  nutrients from aged leaves for their reuse in newly developing sinks. We used  molecular-biological and metabolomics approaches to identify NAC transcription  factor (TF) RD26 as an important regulator of metabolic reprogramming in  Arabidopsis thaliana. RD26 directly activates CHLOROPLAST VESICULATION (CV),  encoding a protein crucial for chloroplast protein degradation, concomitant with  an enhanced protein loss in RD26 overexpressors during senescence, but a reduced  decline of protein in rd26 knockout mutants. RD26 also directly activates LKR/SDH  involved in lysine catabolism, and PES1 important for phytol degradation.  Metabolic profiling revealed reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in RD26  overexpressors, accompanied by the induction of respective catabolic genes.  Degradation of lysine, phytol and GABA is instrumental for maintaining  mitochondrial respiration in carbon-limiting conditions during senescence. RD26  also supports the degradation of starch and the accumulation of mono- and  disaccharides during senescence by directly enhancing the expression of AMY1,  SFP1 and SWEET15 involved in carbohydrate metabolism and transport. Collectively,  during senescence RD26 acts by controlling the expression of genes across the  entire spectrum of the cellular degradation hierarchy.', '2018 Jun', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.15127', 'Mueller-Roeber']
