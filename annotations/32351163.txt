Micro-nanoparticles can enter the root tissue of plant cells along with the multiple lanes, and then accumulate in the tissue. But the plant physiological effect is still less studied. In this study, rice seedlings at germination stage were treated with 100 µM NaBiF<sub>4</sub> and BiF<sub>3</sub>. We found that exogenous application of NaBiF<sub>4</sub> treatment inhibited the elongation of rice roots and promoted the generation of adventitious roots, but treated BiF<sub>3</sub> did not mediate obvious phenotype. Further analysis of the peroxidase activity in related tissues showed that NaBiF<sub>4</sub> induced the activity of SOD and CAT decreased, and POD increased, while BiF<sub>3</sub> only induced the activity of SOD to reduced, but the activity of CAT and POD were no changed. Further analysis of the sodium element and potassium element concentration in tissues showed that only the NaBiF<sub>4</sub> treatment reduced content of potassium, but not sodium. Finally, stress-related genes <i>OsMT1, OsMT2, OsOVP1, OsNIP2;1</i>, and <i>OsMT2b</i> were analyzed by Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). These results showed that NaBiF<sub>4</sub> induced the expression of <i>OsMT2, OsOVP1, OsNIP2;1</i> decreased, and <i>OsMT2b</i> increased. However, BiF<sub>3</sub> only induced expression of <i>OsMT1</i> increased. These results provide a physiological basis for further analysis of the effects of sodium salt-nanoparticles in crop plants.
