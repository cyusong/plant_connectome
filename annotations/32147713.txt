In streptophytic green algae in the genus Zygnema, pre-akinete formation is considered a key survival strategy under extreme environmental conditions in alpine and polar regions. The transition from young, dividing cells to pre-akinetes is associated with morphological changes and the accumulation of storage products. Understanding the underlying metabolic changes could provide insights into survival strategies in polar habitats. Here, GC-MS-based metabolite profiling was used to study the metabolic signature associated with pre-akinete formation in Zygnema sp. from polar regions under laboratory conditions, induced by water and nutrient depletion, or collected in the field. Light microscopy and TEM revealed drastic changes in chloroplast morphology and ultrastructure, degradation of starch grains, and accumulation of lipid bodies in pre-akinetes. Accordingly, the metabolite profiles upon pre-akinete formation reflected a gradual shift in metabolic activity. Compared with young cells, pre-akinetes showed an overall reduction in primary metabolites such as amino acids and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, consistent with a lower metabolic turnover, while they accumulated lipids and oligosaccharides. Overall, the transition to the pre-akinete stage involves re-allocation of photosynthetically fixed energy into storage instead of growth, supporting survival of extreme environmental conditions.
