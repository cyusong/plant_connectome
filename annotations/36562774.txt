Photoperiod plays a critical role in controlling the formation of sexual or vegetative reproductive organs in potato. Although StPHYF-silenced plants overcome day-length limitations to tuberize through a systemic effect on tuberigen StSP6A expression in the stolon, the comprehensive regulatory network of StPHYF remains obscure. Therefore, the present study investigated the transcriptomes of StPHYF-silenced plants and observed that, in addition to known components of the photoperiodic tuberization pathway, florigen StSP3D and other flowering-related genes were activated in StPHYF-silenced plants, exhibiting an early flowering response. Additionally, grafting experiments uncovered the long-distance effect of StPHYF silencing on gene expression in the stolon, including the circadian clock components, flowering-associated MADSs, and tuberization-related regulatory genes. Similar to the AtFT-AtAP1 regulatory module in Arabidopsis, the present study established that the AP1-like StMADS1 functions downstream of the tuberigen activation complex (TAC) and that suppressing StMADS1 inhibits tuberization in vitro and delays tuberization in vivo. Moreover, the expression of StSP6A was downregulated in StMADS1-silenced plants, implying the expression of StSP6A may be feedback-regulated by StMADS1. Overall, these results reveal that the regulatory network of StPHYF controls flowering and tuberization and targets the crucial tuberization factor StMADS1 through TAC, thereby providing a better understanding of StPHYF-mediated day-length perception during potato reproduction.
