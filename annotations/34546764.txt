<i>Albugo candida</i> is an obligate oomycete pathogen that infects many plants in the Brassicaceae family. We resequenced the genome of isolate Ac2V using PacBio long reads and constructed an assembly augmented by Illumina reads. The Ac2VPB genome assembly is 10% larger and more contiguous compared with a previous version. Our annotation of the new assembly, aided by RNA-sequencing information, revealed a 175% expansion (40 to 110) in the CHxC effector class, which we redefined as "CCG" based on motif analysis. This class of effectors consist of arrays of phylogenetically related paralogs residing in gene sparse regions, and shows signatures of positive selection and presence/absence polymorphism. This work provides a resource that allows the dissection of the genomic components underlying <i>A. candida</i> adaptation and, particularly, the role of CCG effectors in virulence and avirulence on different hosts.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
