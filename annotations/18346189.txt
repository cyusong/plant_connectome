['18346189', 'MADS-box transcription factors are key regulators of plant developmental  processes. While the function of MIKC (type II) MADS-box genes has been  intensively studied, only limited data are available for the other more recently  identified classes of MADS-box genes, despite these latter comprising more than  60% of the Arabidopsis MADS-box gene family. Here we describe the function of  AGL23, an Arabidopsis type I MADS-box gene belonging to the Malpha subfamily. We  show that AGL23 plays an important role during development of the female  gametophyte and embryo. The agl23-1 mutant forms a functional megaspore. However,  at this stage female gametophyte development is arrested and the megaspore  persists during subsequent phases of ovule development. Despite the incomplete  penetrance of the female gametophyte defect, plants homozygous for the agl23-1  mutation were never identified. Analysis of developing seeds showed that embryos  homozygous for the agl23-1 allele are albino and unable to give rise to viable  plants. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that this phenotype is due to the  absence of chloroplasts, strongly suggesting that AGL23 is involved in  controlling the biogenesis of organelles during embryo development.', '2008 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03485.x', 'Colombo']
