<i>The CRISPR/Cas9 system is highly efficient at generating targeted mutations in stable transgenic tomato plants, and homozygous deletions of a desired size can be created in the first generation</i>.

CRISPR/Cas9: !generates! targeted mutations
stable transgenic tomato plants: !contain! homozygous deletions
