['11943178', 'Plastid isoprenoids are synthesized via the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate  pathway. A few years after its discovery, most of the Escherichia coli genes  involved in the pathway have been identified, including gcpE. In this work, we  have identified an Arabidopsis thaliana protein with homology to the product of  this gene. The plant polypeptide, GCPE, contains two structural domains that are  absent in the E. coli protein: an N-terminal extension and a central domain of 30  kDa. We demonstrate that the N-terminal region targets the Arabidopsis protein to  chloroplasts in vivo, consistent with its role in plastid isoprenoid  biosynthesis. Although the presence of the internal extra domain may have an  effect on activity, the Arabidopsis mature GCPE was able to complement a  gcpE-defective E. coli strain, indicating the plant protein is a true functional  homologue of the bacterial gcpE gene product.', '2002 Mar 13', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(02)02402-x', 'Rodriguez-Concepcion']
