The chloroplast-resident RNA helicase ISE2 (INCREASED SIZE EXCLUSION LIMIT2) can modulate the formation and distribution of plasmodesmata and intercellular trafficking. We have determined that ISE2 expression is induced by viral infection. Therefore, the responses of Nicotiana benthamiana plants with varying levels of ISE2 expression to infection by Tobacco mosaic virus and Turnip mosaic virus were examined. Surprisingly, increased or decreased ISE2 expression led to faster viral systemic spread and, in some cases, enhanced systemic necrosis. The contributions of RNA silencing and hormone-mediated immune responses to the increased viral susceptibility of these plants were assessed. In addition, Arabidopsis thaliana plants with increased ISE2 expression were found to be more susceptible to infection by the beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii. Our analyses provide intriguing insights into unexpected functional roles of a chloroplast protein in mediating plant-pathogen interactions. The possible roles of plasmodesmata in determining the outcomes of these interactions are also discussed.
