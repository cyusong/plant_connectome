['11090217', 'Disease resistance in Arabidopsis is regulated by multiple signal transduction  pathways in which salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET)  function as key signaling molecules. Epistasis analyses were performed between  mutants that disrupt these pathways (npr1, eds5, ein2, and jar1) and mutants that  constitutively activate these pathways (cpr1, cpr5, and cpr6), allowing  exploration of the relationship between the SA- and JA/ET-mediated resistance  responses. Two important findings were made. First, the constitutive disease  resistance exhibited by cpr1, cpr5, and cpr6 is completely suppressed by the  SA-deficient eds5 mutant but is only partially affected by the SA-insensitive  npr1 mutant. Moreover, eds5 suppresses the SA-accumulating phenotype of the cpr  mutants, whereas npr1 enhances it. These data indicate the existence of an  SA-mediated, NPR1-independent resistance response. Second, the ET-insensitive  mutation ein2 and the JA-insensitive mutation jar1 suppress the NPR1-independent  resistance response exhibited by cpr5 and cpr6. Furthermore, ein2 potentiates SA  accumulation in cpr5 and cpr5 npr1 while dampening SA accumulation in cpr6 and  cpr6 npr1. These latter results indicate that cpr5 and cpr6 regulate resistance  through distinct pathways and that SA-mediated, NPR1-independent resistance works  in combination with components of the JA/ET-mediated response pathways.', '2000 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.11.2175', 'Dong']
