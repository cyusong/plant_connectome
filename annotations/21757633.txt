['21757633', 'Two different, essential Omp85 (Outer membrane protein, 85 kD)-related proteins  exist in the outer envelope membrane of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  chloroplasts: Toc75 (Translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts,  75 kD), encoded by atTOC75-III; and OEP80 (Outer Envelope Protein, 80 kD),  encoded by AtOEP80/atTOC75-V. The atToc75-III protein is closely related to the  originally identified pea (Pisum sativum) Toc75 protein, and it forms a  preprotein translocation channel during chloroplast import; the AtOEP80 protein  is considerably more divergent from pea Toc75, and its role is unknown. As  knockout mutations for atTOC75-III and AtOEP80 are embryo lethal, we employed a  dexamethasone-inducible RNA interference strategy (using the pOpOff2 vector) to  conduct in vivo studies on the roles of these two proteins in older,  postembryonic plants. We conducted comparative studies on plants silenced for  atToc75-III (atToc75-III downward arrow) or AtOEP80 (AtOEP80 downward arrow), as well as additional studies  on a stable, atToc75-III missense allele (toc75-III-3/modifier of altered  response to gravity1), and our results indicated that both proteins are important  for chloroplast biogenesis at postembryonic stages of development. Moreover, both  are important for photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic development, albeit to  different degrees: atToc75-III downward arrow phenotypes were considerably more severe than  those of AtOEP80 downward arrow. Qualitative similarity between the atToc75-III downward arrow and AtOEP80 downward arrow  phenotypes may be linked to deficiencies in atToc75-III and other TOC proteins in  AtOEP80 downward arrow plants. Detailed analysis of atToc75-III downward arrow plants, by electron  microscopy, immunoblotting, quantitative proteomics, and protein import assays,  indicated that these plants are defective in relation to the biogenesis of both  photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic plastids and preproteins, confirming the  earlier hypothesis that atToc75-III functions promiscuously in different  substrate-specific import pathways.', '2011 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.181891', 'Jarvis']
