Drought and heat stresses are two major environmental stress factors that severely threaten crop growth and productivity. Plant <i>delay of germination 1-like</i> (<i>DOG1L</i>) family genes play important roles in various developmental processes and stress responses. In our previous study, a tobacco <i>DOG1L</i> gene (<i>NtDOG1L-T</i>) was found to regulate seedling growth and drought response. Unfortunately, the role of <i>DOG1L</i> genes in heat stress response is yet to be studied. Here, we present data supporting the role of <i>DOG1L</i> genes in heat stress and possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Transcript levels of <i>NtDOG1L-T</i> were rapidly induced by heat or abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Furthermore, <i>NtDOG1L-T</i> promoter activity was markedly activated by ABA or heat stress, as revealed by histochemical staining in transgenic tobacco seedlings. Overexpression of <i>NtDOG1L-T</i> in transgenic lines improved heat stress tolerance. The <i>NtDOG1L-T</i>-transgenic plants exhibited lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation but higher antioxidant enzyme activities in response to heat stress. Furthermore, transcript abundance of some defense-, heat-, and ABA-responsive marker genes was significantly upregulated, as shown by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qPCR) in these transgenic plants. In conclusion, <i>NtDOG1L-T</i> positively regulates heat stress tolerance possibly by modulation of antioxidant capability and defense-, heat-, and ABA-related gene expression in tobacco. This study may provide valuable resource for the potential exploitation of <i>DOG1Ls</i> in genetic improvement of heat stress tolerance in crops.
