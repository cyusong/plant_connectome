Data obtained from Illumina resequencing of 63 apple cultivars were used to obtain full-length S-RNase sequences using a strategy based on both alignment and de novo assembly of reads. The reproductive biology of apple is regulated by the S-RNase-based gametophytic self-incompatibility system, that is genetically controlled by the single, multi-genic and multi-allelic S locus. Resequencing of apple cultivars provided a huge amount of genetic data, that can be aligned to the reference genome in order to characterize variation to a genome-wide level. However, this approach is not immediately adaptable to the S-locus, due to some peculiar features such as the high degree of polymorphism, lack of colinearity between haplotypes and extensive presence of repetitive elements. In this study we describe a dedicated procedure aimed at characterizing S-RNase alleles from resequenced cultivars. The S-genotype of 63 apple accessions is reported; the full length coding sequence was determined for the 25 S-RNase alleles present in the 63 resequenced cultivars; these included 10 previously incomplete sequences (S <sub>5</sub> , S <sub>6a</sub> , S <sub>6b</sub> , S <sub>8</sub> , S <sub>11</sub> , S <sub>23</sub> , S <sub>39</sub> , S <sub>46</sub> , S <sub>50</sub> and S <sub>58</sub> ). Moreover, sequence divergence clearly suggests that alleles S <sub>6a</sub> and S <sub>6b</sub> , proposed to be neutral variants of the same alleles, should be instead considered different specificities. The promoter sequences have also been analyzed, highlighting regions of homology conserved among all the alleles.
