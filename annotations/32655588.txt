Fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization karyotypes have been widely used for evolutionary analysis on chromosome organization and genetic/genomic diversity in the wheat alliance (tribe Triticeae of Poaceae). The karyotpic diversity of <i>Aegilops umbellulata</i>, <i>Ae. markgrafii</i>, <i>Ae. comosa</i> subsp. <i>comosa</i> and subsp. <i>subventricosa</i>, and <i>Ae. uniaristata</i> was evaluated by the fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) probes oligo-pSc119.2 and pTa71 in combination with (AAC)<sub>5</sub>, (ACT)<sub>7</sub>, and (CTT)<sub>12</sub>, respectively. Abundant intra- and interspecific genetic variation was discovered in <i>Ae. umbellulata</i>, <i>Ae. markgrafii</i>, and <i>Ae. comosa</i>, but not <i>Ae. uniaristata.</i> Chromosome 7 of <i>Ae. umbellulata</i> had more variants (six variants) than the other six U chromosomes (2-3 variants) as revealed by probes oligo-pSc119.2 and (AAC)<sub>5</sub>. Intraspecific variation in <i>Ae. markgrafii</i> and <i>Ae. comosa</i> was revealed by oligo-pSc119.2 in combination with (ACT)<sub>7</sub> and (CTT)<sub>12</sub>, respectively. At least five variants were found in every chromosome of <i>Ae. markgrafii</i> and <i>Ae. comosa</i>, and up to 18, 10, and 15 variants were identified for chromosomes 2 of <i>Ae. markgrafii</i>, 4 of <i>Ae. comosa</i> subsp. <i>comosa</i>, and 6 of <i>Ae. comosa</i> subsp. <i>subventricosa</i>. The six <i>Ae. uniaristata</i> accessions showed identical FISH signal patterns. A large number of intra-specific polymorphic FISH signals were observed between the homologous chromosomes of <i>Ae. markgrafii</i> and <i>Ae. comosa</i>, especially chromosomes 1, 2, 4, and 7 of <i>Ae. markgrafii</i>, chromosome 4 of <i>Ae. comosa</i> subsp. <i>comosa</i>, and chromosome 6 of <i>Ae. comosa</i> subsp. <i>subventricosa</i>. Twelve <i>Ae. comosa</i> and 24 <i>Ae. markgrafii</i> accessions showed heteromorphism between homologous chromosomes. Additionally, a translocation between the short arms of chromosomes 1 and 7 of <i>Ae. comosa</i> PI 551038 was identified. The FISH karyotypes can be used to clearly identify the chromosome variations of each chromosome in these <i>Aegilops</i> species and also provide valuable information for understanding the evolutionary relationships and structural genomic variation among <i>Aegilops</i> species.
