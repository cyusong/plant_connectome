In nature, plants are simultaneously exposed to a combination of biotic and abiotic stresses that limit crop yields. Only recently, researchers have started understanding the molecular basis of combined biotic and abiotic stress interactions. Evidences suggest that under combined stress plants exhibit tailored physiological and molecular responses, in addition to several shared responses as part of their stress tolerance strategy. These tailored responses are suggested to occur only in plants exposed to simultaneous stresses and this information cannot be inferred from individual stress studies. In this review article, we provide update on the responses of plants to simultaneous biotic and abiotic stresses, in particular drought and pathogen. Simultaneous occurrence of drought and pathogen during plant growth provokes complex pathways controlled by different signaling events resulting in positive or negative impact of one stress over the other. Here, we summarize the effect of combined drought and pathogen infection on plants and highlight the tailored strategies adapted by plants. Besides, we enumerate the evidences from pathogen derived elicitors and ABA response studies for understanding simultaneous drought and pathogen tolerance.
