Heavy metal elements, which inhibit plant development by destroying cell structure and wilting leaves, are easily absorbed by plants and eventually threaten human health <i>via</i> the food chain. Recently, with the increasing precision and refinement of optical instruments, optical imaging spectroscopy has gradually been applied to the detection and reaction of heavy metals in plants due to its <i>in-situ</i>, real-time, and simple operation compared with traditional chemical analysis methods. Moreover, the emergence of machine learning helps improve detection accuracy, making optical imaging spectroscopy comparable to conventional chemical analysis methods in some situations. This review (a): summarizes the progress of advanced optical imaging spectroscopy techniques coupled with artificial neural network algorithms for plant heavy metal detection over ten years from 2012-2022; (b) briefly describes and compares the principles and characteristics of spectroscopy and traditional chemical techniques applied to plants heavy metal detection, and the advantages of artificial neural network techniques including machine learning and deep learning techniques in combination with spectroscopy; (c) proposes the solutions such as coupling with other analytical and detection methods, portability, to address the challenges of unsatisfactory sensitivity of optical imaging spectroscopy and expensive instruments.
