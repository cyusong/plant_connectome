['17557807', 'Auxin affects the shape of root systems by influencing elongation and branching.  Because multidrug resistance (MDR)-like ABC transporters participate in auxin  transport, they may be expected to contribute to root system development. This  reverse genetic study of Arabidopsis thaliana roots shows that MDR4-mediated  basipetal auxin transport did not affect root elongation or branching. However,  impaired acropetal auxin transport due to mutation of the MDR1 gene caused 21% of  nascent lateral roots to arrest their growth and the remainder to elongate 50%  more slowly than the wild type. Reporter gene analyses indicated a severe auxin  deficit in the apex of mdr1 but not mdr4 lateral roots. The mdr1 deficit was  explained by 40% less acropetal auxin transport within the mdr1 lateral roots.  The slow elongation of mdr1 lateral roots was rescued by auxin and phenocopied in  the wild type by an inhibitor of polar auxin transport. Confocal microscopy  analysis of a functional green fluorescent protein-MDR1 translational fusion  showed the protein to be auxin inducible and present in the tissues responsible  for acropetal transport in the primary root. The protein also accumulated in  lateral root primordia and later in the tissues responsible for acropetal  transport within the lateral root, fully supporting the conclusion that auxin  levels established by MDR1-dependent acropetal transport control lateral root  growth rate to influence root system architecture.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.048777', 'Spalding']
