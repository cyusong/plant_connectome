Commercial strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa Duch., is a species sensitive to salinity. Under saline conditions, Na<sup>+</sup> uptake by the plant is increased, while K<sup>+</sup> uptake is significantly reduced. Maintaining an adequate K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> cytosolic ratio determines the ability of the plant to survive in saline environments. The goal of the present work was to clone and functionally characterize the genes AKT1 and HKT1 involved in K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport in strawberry and to determine the relationship of these genes with the responses of three Fragaria spp. genotypes having different ecological adaptations to salt stress. FaHKT1 and FcHKT1 proteins from F. x ananassa and F. chiloensis have 98.1% of identity, while FaAKT1 and FcAKT1 identity is 99.7%. FaHKT1 and FaAKT1 from F. x ananassa, were functionally characterized in Xenopus oocytes. FaHKT1, belongs to the group I of HKT transporters and is selective for Na<sup>+</sup>. Expression of FaAKT1 in oocytes showed that the protein is a typical inward-rectifying and highly K<sup>+</sup>-selective channel. The relative expression of Fragaria HKT1 and AKT1 genes was studied in roots of F. x ananassa cv. Camarosa and of F. chiloensis (accessions Bau and Cucao) grown under salt stress. The expression of AKT1 was transiently increased in 'Camarosa', decreased in 'Cucao' and was not affected in 'Bau' upon salt stress. HKT1 expression was significantly increased in roots of 'Cucao' and was not affected in the other two genotypes. The increased relative expression of HKT1 and decreased expression of AKT1 in 'Cucao' roots correlates with the higher tolerance to salinity of this genotype in comparison with 'Camarosa' and 'Bau'.
