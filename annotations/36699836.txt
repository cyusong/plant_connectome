Sheath blight (SB) is the most damaging fungal disease in rice caused by a soil-borne pathogenic fungus, <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> Kuhn (R. solani). The disease resistance in rice is a complex quantitative trait controlled by a few major genes. UKMRC2 is a newly developed elite rice variety that possesses high yield potential but is susceptible to sheath blight disease indicating a huge risk of varietal promotion, mass cultivation, and large-scale adoption. The aim of our present study was the development of varietal resistance against R. solani in UKMRC2 to enhance its stability and durability in a wide range of environments and to validate the effects of an SB-resistance QTL on the new genetic background. In our study, we developed 290 BC1F1 backcross progenies from a cross between UKMRC2 and Tetep to introgress the QTL <i>qSBR11-1<sub>TT</sub></i> into the UKMRC2 genetic background. Validation of the introgressed QTL region was performed via QTL analysis based on QTL-linked SSR marker genotyping and phenotyping against R. solani artificial field inoculation techniques. The QTL <i>qSBR11-1<sub>TT</sub></i> was then authenticated with the results of LOD score (3.25) derived from composite interval mapping, percent phenotypic variance explained (14.6%), and additive effect (1.1) of the QTLs. The QTL region was accurately defined by a pair of flanking markers K39512 and RM7443 with a peak marker RM27360. We found that the presence of combination of alleles, RM224, RM27360 and K39512 demonstrate an improved resistance against the disease rather than any of the single allele. Thus, the presence of the QTL <i>qSBR11-1<sub>TT</sub></i> has been validated and confirmed in the URMRC2 genetic background which reveals an opportunity to use the QTL linked with these resistance alleles opens an avenue to resume sheath blight resistance breeding in the future with marker-assisted selection program to boost up resistance in rice varieties.
