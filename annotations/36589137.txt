Wheat powdery mildew caused by a biotrophic fungus <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Bgt</i>), is a widespread airborne disease which continues to threaten global wheat production. One of the most chemical-free and cost-effective approaches for the management of wheat powdery mildew is the exploitation of resistant cultivars. Accumulating evidence has reported that more than 100 powdery mildew resistance genes or alleles mapping to 63 different loci (<i>Pm1-Pm68</i>) have been identified from common wheat and its wild relatives, and only a few of them have been cloned so far. However, continuous emergence of new pathogen races with novel degrees of virulence renders wheat resistance genes ineffective. An essential breeding strategy for achieving more durable resistance is the pyramiding of resistance genes into a single genotype. The genetics of host-pathogen interactions integrated with temperature conditions and the interaction between resistance genes and their corresponding pathogen a virulence genes or other resistance genes within the wheat genome determine the expression of resistance genes. Considerable progress has been made in revealing <i>Bgt</i> pathogenesis mechanisms, identification of resistance genes and breeding of wheat powdery mildew resistant cultivars. A detailed understanding of the molecular interactions between wheat and <i>Bgt</i> will facilitate the development of novel and effective approaches for controlling powdery mildew. This review gives a succinct overview of the molecular basis of interactions between wheat and <i>Bgt</i>, and wheat defense mechanisms against <i>Bgt</i> infection. It will also unleash the unsung roles of epigenetic processes, autophagy and silicon in wheat resistance to <i>Bgt</i>.
