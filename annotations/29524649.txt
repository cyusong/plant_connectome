Plant height has a major effect on grain yield in crops such as rice (Oryza sativa), and the hormone gibberellic acid (GA) regulates many developmental processes that feed into plant height. Rice ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 (Eui1) encodes a GA-deactivating enzyme governing elongation of the uppermost internode. The expression of Eui1 is finely tuned, thereby maintaining homeostasis of endogenous bioactive GA and producing plants of normal plant height. Here, we identified a dominant dwarf mutant, dEui1, caused by the deletion of an RY motif-containing cis-silencing element (SE1) in the intron of Eui1. Detailed genetic and molecular analysis of SE1 revealed that this intronic cis element recruits at least one trans-acting repressor complex, containing the B3 repressors OsVAL2 and OsGD1, the SAP18 co-repressor, and the histone deacetylase OsHDA710, to negatively regulate the expression of Eui1. This complex generates closed chromatin at Eui1, suppressing Eui1 expression and modulating GA homeostasis. Loss of SE1 or dysfunction of the complex components impairs histone deacetylation and H3K27me3 methylation of Eui1 chromatin, thereby increasing Eui1 transcription and decreasing bioactive GA, producing dwarfism in rice. Together, our results reveal a novel silencing mechanism in which the intronic cis element SE1 negatively regulates Eui1 expression via repressor complexes that modulate histone deacetylation and/or methylation.
