['8917599', 'Three different cDNAs, Prh-19, Prh-26, and Prh-43  [3\'-phosphoadenosine-5\'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase homolog], have been  isolated by complementation of an Escherichia coli cysH mutant, defective in PAPS  reductase activity, to prototrophy with an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library in  the expression vector lambda YES. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs revealed  continuous open reading frames encoding polypeptides of 465, 458, and 453 amino  acids, with calculated molecular masses of 51.3, 50.5, and 50.4 kDa,  respectively, that have strong homology with fungal, yeast and bacterial PAPS  reductases. However, unlike microbial PAPS reductases, each PRH protein has an  N-terminal extension, characteristic of a plastid transit peptide, and a  C-terminal extension that has amino acid and deduced three-dimensional homology  to thioredoxin proteins. Adenosine 5\'-phosphosulfate (APS) was shown to be a much  more efficient substrate than PAPS when the activity of the PRH proteins was  tested by their ability to convert 35S-labeled substrate to acid-volatile  35S-sulfite. We speculate that the thioredoxin-like domain is involved in  catalytic function, and that the PRH proteins may function as novel "APS  reductase" enzymes. Southern hybridization analysis showed the presence of a  small multigene family in the Arabidopsis genome. RNA blot hybridization with  gene-specific probes revealed for each gene the presence of a transcript of  approximately 1.85 kb in leaves, stems, and roots that increased on sulfate  starvation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cloning and  characterization of plant genes that encode proteins with APS reductase activity  and supports the suggestion that APS can be utilized directly, without activation  to PAPS, as an intermediary substrate in reductive sulfate assimilation.', '1996 Nov 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.93.23.13377', 'Wray']
