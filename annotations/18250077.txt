The procera (pro) mutant of tomato exhibits a well-characterized constitutive gibberellic acid (GA) response phenotype. The tomato DELLA gene LeGAI in the pro mutant background contains a point mutation that results in an amino acid change in the conserved VHVID putative DNA-binding domain in LeGAI to VHEID. This same point mutation is in four different genetic backgrounds exhibiting the pro phenotype, suggesting that this mutation co-segregates with the pro phenotype. Complementation of the mutant with a constitutively expressed wild-type LeGAI gene sequence was not conclusive due to the infertility of transgenic plants. The pro mutation alters tomato branching architecture through differential suppression of axillary bud development, indicating a role for DELLA proteins in the regulation of plant structure. Isolated gib-1 pro double mutant embryo axes, which are unable to synthesize GA, germinate faster than their wild-type counterparts, and exert greater embryo growth potential. The pro mutation is therefore regulating GA responses within the tomato embryo. Transient expression of a LeGAI-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein in onion epidermis results in its location to the nucleus, and this protein is rapidly degraded by the proteasome in the presence of GA.
