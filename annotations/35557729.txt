Supplemental light is needed during the winter months in high latitude regions to achieve the desired daily light integral (DLI) (photoperiod × intensity) for greenhouse pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>) production. Peppers tend to have short internodes causing fruit stacking and higher labor time for plant maintenance when grown under supplemental light. Far-red light can increase internode length, and our previous study on tomatoes (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) also discovered monochromatic blue light at night during continuous lighting (CL, 24 h) increased stem elongation. Furthermore, the use of low-intensity, long photoperiod lighting can reduce light fixture costs and overall electricity costs due to lower power prices during the night. Therefore, we investigated the use of blue and/or far-red light during the night period of CL to increase stem elongation. Three pepper cultivars with different internode lengths/growing characteristics ('Maureno,' 'Gina,' and 'Eurix') were used to investigate the effects on plant morphology in a short experiment, and one cultivar 'Maureno' was used in a long experiment to assess the impact on fruit yield. The five lighting treatments that were used are as follows: 16 h of white light during the day followed by either 8 h of darkness (16W - control), white light (24W), blue light only (16W + 8B), blue + far-red light (16W + 8BFR), or far-red light only (16W + 8FR). Calculated nighttime phytochrome photostationary state (PSS) was 0.833, 0.566, 0.315, and 0.186 for 24W, 16W + 8B, 16W + 8BFR, and 16W + 8FR respectively. All five treatments had the same DLI in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and far-red light. The 16W + 8BFR and 16W + 8FR treatments significantly increased internode length compared to 16W and 24W but neither was more impactful than the other. The 16W + 8B treatment also increased internode length but to a lesser extent than 16W + 8BFR and 16W + 8FR. This indicates that a nighttime PSS of 0.315 is sufficient to maximize stem elongation. Both 16W + 8B and 16W + 8BFR drove photosynthesis during the nighttime supporting a similar yield compared to 16W. Therefore, 16W + 8BFR is the most potential lighting strategy as it can lead to a greater reduction in the light fixture and electrical costs while maintaining yield and enhancing internode length.
