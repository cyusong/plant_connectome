Microspores of <i>Brassica napus</i> can be diverted from normal pollen development into embryogenesis by treating them with a mild heat shock. As microspore embryogenesis closely resembles zygotic embryogenesis, it is used as model for studying the molecular mechanisms controlling embryo formation. A previous study comparing the transcriptomes of three-day-old sorted embryogenic and pollen-like (non-embryogenic) microspores identified a gene homologous to <i>AT1G74730</i> of unknown function that was upregulated 8-fold in the embryogenic cells. In the current study, the gene was isolated and sequenced from <i>B. napus</i> and named <i>BnMicEmUP</i> (<i>B. napus</i> microspore embryogenesis upregulated gene). Four forms of <i>BnMicEmUP</i> mRNA and three forms of genomic DNA were identified. <i>BnMicEmUP2,3</i> was upregulated more than 7-fold by day 3 in embryogenic microspore cultures compared to non-induced cultures. <i>BnMicEmUP1,4</i> was highly expressed in leaves. Transient expression studies of <i>BnMicEmUP3::GFP</i> fusion protein in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and in stable <i>Arabidopsis</i> transgenics showed that it accumulates in chloroplasts. The features of the BnMicEmUP protein, which include a chloroplast targeting region, a basic region, and a large region containing 11 complete leucine-rich repeats, suggest that it is similar to a bZIP PEND (plastid envelope DNA-binding protein) protein, a DNA binding protein found in the inner envelope membrane of developing chloroplasts. Here, we report that the <i>BnMicEmUP3</i> overexpression in <i>Arabidopsis</i> increases the sensitivity of seedlings to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). The <i>BnMicEmUP</i> proteins appear to be transcription factors that are localized in plastids and are involved in plant responses to biotic and abiotic environmental stresses; as well as the results obtained from this study can be used to improve crop yield.
