['22578268', '* The activation of high-affinity root transport systems is the best-conserved  strategy employed by plants to cope with low inorganic phosphate (Pi)  availability, a role traditionally assigned to Pi transporters of the Pht1  family, whose respective contributions to Pi acquisition remain unclear. * To  characterize the Arabidopsis thaliana Pht1;9 transporter, we combined  heterologous functional expression in yeast with expression/subcellular  localization studies and reverse genetics approaches in planta. Double  Pht1;9/Pht1;8 silencing lines were also generated to gain insight into the role  of the closest Pht1;9 homolog. * Pht1;9 encodes a functional plasma  membrane-localized transporter that mediates high-affinity Pi/H(+) symport activity  in yeast and is highly induced in Pi-starved Arabidopsis roots. Null pht1;9  alleles exhibit exacerbated responses to prolonged Pi limitation and enhanced  tolerance to arsenate exposure, whereas Pht1;9 overexpression induces the  opposite phenotypes. Strikingly, Pht1;9/Pht1;8 silencing lines display more  pronounced defects than the pht1;9 mutants. * Pi and arsenic plant content  analyses confirmed a role of Pht1;9 in Pi acquisition during Pi starvation and  arsenate uptake at the root-soil interface. Although not affecting plant internal  Pi repartition, Pht1;9 activity influences the overall Arabidopsis Pi status.  Finally, our results indicate that both the Pht1;9 and Pht1;8 transporters  function in sustaining plant Pi supply on environmental Pi depletion.', '2012 Jul', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04167.x', 'Duque']
