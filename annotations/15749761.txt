['15749761', 'Histone acetylation is modulated through the action of histone acetyltransferases  and deacetylases, which play key roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene  expression. Previously, we have identified a yeast histone deacetylase REDUCED  POTASSIUM DEPENDENCY3 (RPD3) homolog, HISTONE DEACETYLASE19 (HDA19) (AtRPD3A), in  Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we report further study of the expression and  function of HDA19. Analysis of Arabidopsis plants containing the  HDA19:beta-glucuronidase fusion gene revealed that HDA19 was expressed throughout  the life of the plant and in most plant organs examined. In addition, the  expression of HDA19 was induced by wounding, the pathogen Alternaria  brassicicola, and the plant hormones jasmonic acid and ethylene. Using green  fluorescent protein fusion, we demonstrated that HDA19 accumulated in the nuclei  of Arabidopsis cells. Overexpression of HDA19 in 35S:HDA19 plants decreased  histone acetylation levels, whereas downregulation of HDA19 in HDA19-RNA  interference (RNAi) plants increased histone acetylation levels. In comparison  with wild-type plants, 35S:HDA19 transgenic plants had increased expression of  ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1 and were more resistant to the pathogen A.  brassicicola. The expression of jasmonic acid and ethylene regulated  PATHOGENESIS-RELATED genes, Basic Chitinase and beta-1,3-Glucanase, was  upregulated in 35S:HDA19 plants but downregulated in HDA19-RNAi plants. Our  studies provide evidence that HDA19 may regulate gene expression involved in  jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling of pathogen response in Arabidopsis.', '2005 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.028514', 'Wu']
