During exposure to salt environments, plants could perceive salt signal and transmit the signal to cellular machinery to activate adaptive responses. In bryophytes, salt signal components and transcript factor identified suggest that salt activate adaptive responses to tolerate adverse environments. The ability of bryophytes to tolerate salt is determined by multiple biochemical pathways. Transmembrane transport proteins that mediate ion fluxes play a curial role in ionic and osmotic homeostasis under salt environments. Defense proteins protect cells from denaturation and degradation, as well as from oxidative damage following exposure to salt stress in bryophytes. ABA and salt stress positively affect the expression of common genes that participate in protection plant cells from injure, and ABA may be responsible for the ability to tolerate salt stress in bryophytes. In this paper, we reveal the mechanisms of salt responses and tolerance in bryophytes, and imply conservation between higher plants and bryophytes in response and tolerance to salt stress.
