<i>Verticillium longisporum</i> is a vascular fungal pathogen leading to severe crop loss, particular in oilseed rape. Transcription factors (TF) are highly suited for genetic engineering of pathogen-resistant crops, as they control sets of functionally associated genes. Applying the AtTORF-Ex (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> transcription factor open reading frame expression) collection, a simple and robust screen of TF-overexpressing plants was established displaying reduced fungal colonization. Distinct members of the large ethylene response factor (ERF) family, namely ERF96 and the six highly related subgroup IXb members ERF102 to ERF107, were identified. Whereas overexpression of these ERF significantly reduces fungal propagation, single loss-of-function approaches did not reveal altered susceptibility. Hence, this gain-of-function approach is particularly suited to identify redundant family members. Expression analyses disclosed distinct <i>ERF</i> gene activation patterns in roots and leaves, suggesting functional differences. Transcriptome studies performed on chemically induced <i>ERF106</i> expression revealed an enrichment of genes involved in the biosynthesis of antimicrobial indole glucosinolates (IG), such as <i>CYP81F2</i> (<i>CYTOCHROME P450-MONOOXYGENASE 81F2</i>), which is directly regulated by IXb-ERF via two GCC-like <i>cis</i>-elements. The impact of IG in restricting fungal propagation was further supported as the <i>cyp81f2</i> mutant displayed significantly enhanced susceptibility. Taken together, this proof-of-concept approach provides a novel strategy to identify candidate TF that are valuable genetic resources for engineering or breeding pathogen-resistant crop plants.
