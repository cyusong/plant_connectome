Five RALF (rapid alkalinization factor)-like genes, named ScRALF1 to 5, were isolated from fertilized ovule and ovary cDNA libraries of Solanum chacoense. They showed high sequence similarities with the RALF protein sequence from Nicotiana tabacum, and exhibited the characteristic architecture of RALF polypeptides. All ScRALFs were moderately to highly expressed at some stage of fruit maturation. ScRALF1 and ScRALF3 were predominantly expressed in ovaries and larger fruits, while ScRALF2, ScRALF4, and ScRALF5 were also expressed in other tissues, indicating that while some RALFs may be involved in fruit maturation, others could be involved in other developmental processes. Wounding or treatment of plants with growth regulators involved in plant defense responses had no significant impact on the mRNA level of any of these genes. These results suggest and support previous data showing that RALF peptides are more likely to act as a small peptide involved in plant development than in defense responses.
