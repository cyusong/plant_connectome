A soil–plant hydraulic model shows that the degree of isohydricity is constrained by below-ground hydraulic limitations and that the shape of plant water potential (WP) curve depends on soil hydraulics.

Soil: !constrains! Isohydricity
Plant: !depends on! Soil hydraulics
WP curve: !shaped by! Soil hydraulics
