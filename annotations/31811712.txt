The availability of quantification methods for subcellular organelle dynamic analysis has increased rapidly over the last 20 years. The application of these techniques to contiguous subcellular structures that exhibit dynamic remodelling over a range of scales and orientations is challenging, as quantification of 'movement' rarely corresponds to traditional, qualitative classifications of types of organelle movement. The plant endoplasmic reticulum represents a particular challenge for dynamic quantification as it itself is an entirely contiguous organelle that is in a constant state of flux and gross remodelling, controlled by the actinomyosin cytoskeleton.
