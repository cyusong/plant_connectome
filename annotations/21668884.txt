['21668884', '* The thylakoid protease Deg2 is a serine-type protease peripherally attached to  the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane. Given the lack of knowledge  concerning its function, two T-DNA insertion lines devoid of Deg2 were prepared  to study the functional importance of this protease in Arabidopsis thaliana. *  The phenotypic appearance of deg2 mutants was studied using a combination of  stereo and transmission electron microscopy, and short-stress-mediated  degradation of apoproteins of minor light-harvesting antennae of photosystem II  (PSII) was analysed by immunoblotting in the mutants in comparison with wild-type  plants. * Deg2 repression produced a phenotype in which reduced leaf area and  modified chloroplast ultrastructure of older leaves were the most prominent  features. In contrast to the wild type, the chloroplasts of second-whorl leaves  of 4-wk-old deg2 mutants did not display features typical of the early senescence  phase, such as undulation of the chloroplast envelope and thylakoids. The ability  to degrade the photosystem II light-harvesting protein Lhcb6 apoprotein in  response to brief high-salt, wounding, high-temperature and high-irradiance  stress was demonstrated to be impaired in deg2 mutants. * Our results suggest  that Deg2 is required for normal plant development, including the chloroplast  life cycle, and has an important function in the degradation of Lhcb6 in response  to short-duration stresses.', '2011 Oct', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03782.x', 'Jackowski']
