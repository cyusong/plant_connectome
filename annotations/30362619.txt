Fluorescent in blue light (FLU) is a negative regulator involved in dark repression of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthesis and interacts with glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR), the rate-limiting enzyme of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. In this study, we investigated FLU's regulatory function in light-exposed FLU-overexpressing (FLUOE) Arabidopsis lines and under fluctuating light intensities in wild-type (WT) and flu seedlings. FLUOE lines suppress ALA synthesis in the light, resulting in reduced chlorophyll content, but more strongly in low and high light than in medium growth light. This situation indicates that FLU's impact on chlorophyll biosynthesis depends on light intensity. FLU overexpressors contain strongly increased amounts of mainly membrane-associated GluTR. These findings correlate with FLU-dependent localization of GluTR to plastidic membranes and concomitant inhibition, such that only the soluble GluTR fraction is active. The overaccumulation of membrane-associated GluTR indicates that FLU binding enhances GluTR stability. Interestingly, under fluctuating light, the leaves of flu mutants contain less chlorophyll compared with WT and become necrotic. We propose that FLU is basically required for fine-tuned ALA synthesis. FLU not only mediates dark repression of ALA synthesis, but functions also to control balanced ALA synthesis under variable light intensities to ensure the adequate supply of chlorophyll.
