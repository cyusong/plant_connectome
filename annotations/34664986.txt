Being sessile, plants are continuously challenged by changes in their surrounding environment and must survive and defend themselves against a multitude of pathogens. Plants have evolved a mode for pathogen recognition that activates signaling cascades such as reactive oxygen species, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathways, in coordination with hormone signaling, to execute the defense response at the local and systemic levels. Phytopathogens have evolved to manipulate cellular and hormonal signaling and exploit hosts' cell-to-cell connections in many ways at multiple levels. Overall, triumph over pathogens depends on how efficiently the pathogens are recognized and how rapidly the plant response is initiated through efficient intercellular communication via apoplastic and symplastic routes. Here, we review how intercellular communication in plants is mediated, manipulated, and maneuvered during plant-pathogen interaction.[Formula: see text] The author(s) have dedicated the work to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 "No Rights Reserved" license by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law, 2022.
