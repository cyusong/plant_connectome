Understanding the complex regulatory network underlying plant nitrogen (N) responses associated with high Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) is one of the main challenges for sustainable cropping systems. Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>), acting as both an N source and a signal molecule, provokes very fast transcriptome reprogramming, allowing plants to adapt to its availability. These changes are genotype- and tissue-specific; thus, the comparison between contrasting genotypes is crucial to uncovering high NUE mechanisms. Here, we compared, for the first time, the spatio-temporal transcriptome changes in both root and shoot of two NUE contrasting tomato genotypes, Regina Ostuni (high-NUE) and UC82 (low-NUE), in response to short-term (within 24 h) low (LN) and high (HN) NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> resupply. Using time-series transcriptome data (0, 8, and 24 h), we identified 395 and 482 N-responsive genes differentially expressed (DEGs) between RO and UC82 in shoot and root, respectively. Protein kinase signaling plant hormone signal transduction, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were the main enriched metabolic pathways in shoot and root, respectively, and were upregulated in RO compared to UC82. Interestingly, several N transporters belonging to NRT and NPF families, such as <i>NRT2.3, NRT2.4, NPF1.2,</i> and <i>NPF8.3</i>, were found differentially expressed between RO and UC82 genotypes, which might explain the contrasting NUE performances. Transcription factors (TFs) belonging to several families, such as ERF, LOB, GLK, NFYB, ARF, Zinc-finger, and MYB, were differentially expressed between genotypes in response to LN. A complementary Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) allowed the identification of LN-responsive co-expression modules in RO shoot and root. The regulatory network analysis revealed candidate genes that might have key functions in short-term LN regulation. In particular, an asparagine synthetase (ASNS), a CBL-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (<i>CIPK1</i>), a cytokinin riboside 5'-monophosphate phosphoribohydrolase (LOG8), a glycosyltransferase (<i>UGT73C4</i>), and an ERF2 were identified in the shoot, while an LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase (<i>FEI1</i>) and two TFs <i>NF-YB5</i> and <i>LOB37</i> were identified in the root. Our results revealed potential candidate genes that independently and/or concurrently may regulate short-term low-N response, suggesting a key role played by cytokinin and ROS balancing in early LN regulation mechanisms adopted by the N-use efficient genotype RO.
