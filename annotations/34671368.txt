Numerous studies have confirmed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can promote plant nitrogen and phosphorus absorption, and prime systemic plant defense to plant pathogenic microbes. Despite that, the information on the interaction between AMF and plant pathogenic microbes is limited, especially the influence of plant pathogenic microbes on the effect of AMF promoting plant growth. In this study, 650 independent paired-wise observations from 136 published papers were collected and used to calculate the different effect of AMF with plant pathogenic microbes (DAPP) in promoting plant growth through meta-analysis. The results showed that AMF had a higher effect size on plant growth with pathogenic microbes comparing to without pathogenic microbes, including the significant effects in shoot and total fresh biomass, and shoot, root, and total dry biomass. The results of the selection models revealed that the most important factor determining the DAPP on plant dry biomass was the harm level of plant pathogenic microbes on the plant dry biomass, which was negatively correlated. Furthermore, the change of AMF root length colonization (RLC) was the sub-important factor, which was positively correlated with the DAPP. Taken together, these results have implications for understanding the potential and application of AMF in agroecosystems.
