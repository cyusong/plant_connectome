Jasmonic acid (JA) is a key regulator of plant defense responses. Although the transcription factor MYC2, the master regulator of the JA signaling pathway, orchestrates a hierarchical transcriptional cascade that regulates the JA responses, only a few transcriptional regulators involved in this cascade have been described. Here, we identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), METHYL JASMONATE (MeJA)-INDUCED GENE (SlJIG), the expression of which was strongly induced by MeJA treatment. Genetic and molecular biology experiments revealed that SlJIG is a direct target of MYC2. SlJIG knockout plants generated by gene editing had lower terpene contents than the wild type from the lower expression of TERPENE SYNTHASE (TPS) genes, rendering them more appealing to cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera). Moreover, SlJIG knockouts exhibited weaker JA-mediated induction of TPSs, suggesting that SlJIG may participate in JA-induced terpene biosynthesis. Knocking out SlJIG also resulted in attenuated expression of JA-responsive defense genes, which may contribute to the observed lower resistance to cotton bollworm and to the fungus Botrytis cinerea. We conclude that SlJIG is a direct target of MYC2, forms a MYC2-SlJIG module, and functions in terpene biosynthesis and resistance against cotton bollworm and B. cinerea.
