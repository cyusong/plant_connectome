Because light conditions in the forest understory are highly heterogeneous, photosynthetic acclimation to spatially variable irradiance within a crown is important for crown-level carbon assimilation. The effect of variation in irradiance within the crown on leaf nitrogen content and photosynthetic rate was examined for pinnate compound leaves in saplings of Cedrela sinensis, a pioneer deciduous tree. Five shading treatments, in which 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of leaves were shaded, were established by artificial heavy shading using shade screen umbrellas with 25% transmittance. Although the nitrogen content of leaves was constant regardless of shading treatment, ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) content and light-saturated photosynthetic capacity were lower in shade leaves within partially shaded crowns than within fully shaded crowns. Shade leaves within partially shaded crowns contained higher amount of amino acids. Most shade leaves died in partially shaded crowns, whereas more than half of shade leaves survived in totally shaded crowns. Assumptions on photosynthetic acclimation to local light conditions cannot explain why shade leaves have different photosynthetic capacities and survival rates in between partially and totally shaded crowns. Irradiance heterogeneity within the crown causes a distinct variation in photosynthetic activity between sun and shaded leaves within the crown.
