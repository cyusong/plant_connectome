['27502163', 'Ribosomal proteins are involved in numerous essential cell activities in plants.  However, the regulatory role in specific plant developmental processes has not  yet been fully elucidated. Here we identified the new ribosomal protein L18aB,  which is specifically involved in sexual reproduction and plays a critical role  in male gametophyte development and embryo pattern formation. In rpl18aB mutant  plants, the mature pollen grains can germinate normally, but their  competitiveness for growing in the style is significantly reduced. More  interestingly, RPL18aB is required in early embryogenesis. rpl18aB embryos  displayed irregular cell division orientations in the early pro-embryo and  arrested at the globular stage with possible, secondary pattern formation  defects. Further investigations revealed that the polar transportation of auxin  is disturbed in the rpl18aB mutant embryos, which may explain the observed  failure in embryo pattern formation. The cell type-specific complementation of  RPL18aB in rpl18aB was not able to recover the phenotype, indicating that RPL18aB  may play an essential role in early cell fate determination. This work unravels a  novel role in embryo development for a ribosomal protein, and provides insight  into regulatory mechanism of early embryogenesis.', '2016 Aug 9', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep31195', 'Peng']
