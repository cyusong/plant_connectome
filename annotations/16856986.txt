['16856986', 'In plants, excess reactive oxygen species are toxic molecules induced under  environmental stresses, including pathogen invasions and abiotic stresses. Many  anti-oxidant defense systems have been reported to require NADPH as an important  reducing energy equivalent. However, the sources of NADPH and the molecular  mechanisms of maintaining cytoplasmic redox balance are unclear. Here, we report  the biological function of a putative cytoplasmic NADH kinase (NADK3) in several  abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis. We found that cytoplasmic NADPH is  provided mostly by the product of the NADK3 gene in Arabidopsis. Expression of he  NADK3 gene is responsive to abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stress conditions,  including methyl violgen (MV), high salinity and osmotic shock. An NADK3 null  mutant showed hypersensitivity to oxidative stress in both seed germination and  seedling growth. Seed germination of the mutant plants also showed increased  sensitivity to ABA, salt and mannitol. Furthermore, stress-related target genes  were identified as upregulated in the mutant by mannitol and MV. Our study  indicates that this cytoplasmic NADH kinase, a key source of the cellular  reductant NADPH, is required for various abiotic stress responses.', '2006 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02816.x', 'Wang']
