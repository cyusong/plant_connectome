Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) is a good source of carbohydrates, an excellent raw material for starch-based industries, and a strong candidate for biofuel production due to its high starch content. However, the molecular basis of starch biosynthesis and accumulation in sweet potato is still insufficiently understood. Glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocators (GPTs) mediate the import of glucose-6-phosphate (Glc6P) into plastids for starch synthesis. Here, we report the isolation of a GPT-encoding gene, IbG6PPT1, from sweet potato and the identification of two additional IbG6PPT1 gene copies in the sweet potato genome. IbG6PPT1 encodes a chloroplast membrane-localized GPT belonging to the GPT1 group and highly expressed in storage root of sweet potato. Heterologous expression of IbG6PPT1 resulted in increased starch content in the leaves, root tips, and seeds and soluble sugar in seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, but a reduction in soluble sugar in the leaves. These findings suggested that IbG6PPT1 might play a critical role in the distribution of carbon sources in source and sink and the accumulation of carbohydrates in storage tissues and would be a good candidate gene for controlling critical starch properties in sweet potato.
