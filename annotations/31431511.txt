['31431511', 'The dual-affinity nitrate transceptor NITRATE TRANSPORTER1.1 (NRT1.1) has two  modes of transport and signaling, governed by Thr-101 (T101) phosphorylation.  NRT1.1 regulates lateral root (LR) development by modulating nitrate-dependent  basipetal auxin export and nitrate-mediated signal transduction. Here, using the  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) NRT1.1(T101D) phosphomimetic and NRT1.1(T101A)  nonphosphorylatable mutants, we found that the phosphorylation state of NRT1.1  plays a key role in NRT1.1 function during LR development. Single-particle  tracking revealed that phosphorylation affected NRT1.1 spatiotemporal dynamics.  The phosphomimetic NRT1.1(T101D) form showed fast lateral mobility and membrane  partitioning that facilitated auxin flux under low-nitrate conditions. By  contrast, nonphosphorylatable NRT1.1(T101A) showed low lateral mobility and  oligomerized at the plasma membrane (PM), where it induced endocytosis via the  clathrin-mediated endocytosis and microdomain-mediated endocytosis pathways under  high-nitrate conditions. These behaviors promoted LR development by suppressing  NRT1.1-controlled auxin transport on the PM and stimulating Ca(2+)-ARABIDOPSIS  NITRATE REGULATED1 signaling from the endosome.', '2019 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00346', 'ORCID:']
