E3-ubiquitin ligases are known to confer abiotic stress responses in plants. In the present study, <i>GmPUB21</i>, a novel U-box E3-ubiquitin ligase-encoding gene, was isolated from soybean and functionally characterized. The expression of <i>GmPUB21</i>, which possesses E3-ubiquitin ligase activity, was found to be significantly up-regulated by drought, salinity, and ABA treatments. The fusion protein GmPUB21-GFP was localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and plasma membrane. Transgenic lines of the <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> over-expressing <i>GmPUB21</i> showed more sensitive to osmotic, salinity stress and ABA in seed germination and inhibited mannitol/NaCl-mediated stomatal closure. Moreover, higher reactive oxygen species accumulation was observed in <i>GmPUB21</i> overexpressing plants after drought and salinity treatment than in wild-type (WT) plants. Contrarily, silencing of <i>GmPUB21</i> in soybean plants significantly enhanced the tolerance to drought and salinity stresses. Collectively, our results revealed that <i>GmPUB21</i> negatively regulates the drought and salinity tolerance by increasing the stomatal density and aperture via the ABA signaling pathway. These findings improved our understanding of the role of <i>GmPUB21</i> under drought and salinity stresses in soybean.
