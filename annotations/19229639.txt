['19229639', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana Tonoplast Intrinsic Protein 1;1 (AtTIP1;1) is a member  of the tonoplast aquaporin family. The tissue-specific expression pattern and  intracellular localization of AtTIP1;1 were characterized using GUS and GFP  fusion genes. Results indicate that AtTIP1;1 is expressed in almost all cell  types with the notable exception of meristematic cells. The highest level of  AtTIP1;1 expression was detected in vessel-flanking cells in vascular bundles.  AtTIP1;1-GFP fusion protein labelled the tonoplast of the central vacuole and  other smaller peripheral vacuoles. The fusion protein was not found evenly  distributed along the tonoplast continuum but concentrated in contact zones of  tonoplasts from adjacent vacuoles and in invaginations of the central vacuole.  Such invaginations may result from partially engulfed small vacuoles. A knockout  mutant was isolated and characterized to gain insight into AtTIP1;1 function. No  phenotypic alteration was found under optimal growth conditions indicating that  AtTIP1;1 function is not essential to the plant and that some members of the TIP  family may act redundantly to facilitate water flow across the tonoplast.  However, a conditional root phenotype was observed when mutant plants were grown  on a glycerol-containing medium.', '2009 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-009-9465-2', 'Bouhidel']
