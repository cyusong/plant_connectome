['23451828', 'The microtubule (MT)-associated putative kinase RUNKEL (RUK) is an important  component of the phragmoplast machinery involved in cell plate formation in  Arabidopsis somatic cytokinesis. Since loss-of-function ruk mutants display  seedling lethality, it was previously not known whether RUK functions in mature  sporophytes or during gametophyte development. In this study we utilized RUK  proteins that lack the N-terminal kinase domain to further examine biological  processes related to RUK function. Truncated RUK proteins when expressed in  wild-type Arabidopsis plants cause cellularization defects not only in seedlings  and adult tissues but also during male meiocyte development, resulting in  abnormal pollen and reduced fertility. Ultrastructural analysis of male tetrads  revealed irregular and incomplete or absent intersporal cell walls, caused by  disorganized radial MT arrays. Moreover, in ruk mutants endosperm cellularization  defects were also caused by disorganized radial MT arrays. Intriguingly, in  seedlings expressing truncated RUK proteins, the kinesin HINKEL, which is  required for the activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling  pathway regulating phragmoplast expansion, was mislocalized. Together, these  observations support a common role for RUK in both phragmoplast-based cytokinesis  in somatic cells and syncytial cytokinesis in reproductive cells.', '2013 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12160', 'Muller']
