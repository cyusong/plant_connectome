['28250068', 'Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as higher molecular  weight preproteins and imported via the translocons in the outer (TOC) and inner  (TIC) envelope membranes of chloroplasts. Toc159 functions as a primary receptor  and directly binds preproteins through its dimeric GTPase domain. As a first step  toward a molecular understanding of how Toc159 mediates preprotein import, we  mapped the preprotein-binding regions on the Toc159 GTPase domain (Toc159G) of  pea (Pisum sativum) using cleavage by bound preproteins conjugated with the  artificial protease FeBABE and cysteine-cysteine cross-linking. Our results show  that residues at the dimer interface and the switch II region of Toc159G are in  close proximity to preproteins. The mature portion of preproteins was observed  preferentially at the dimer interface, whereas the transit peptide was found at  both regions equally. Chloroplasts from transgenic plants expressing engineered  Toc159 with a cysteine placed at the dimer interface showed increased  cross-linking to bound preproteins. Our data suggest that, during preprotein  import, the Toc159G dimer disengages and the dimer interface contacts  translocating preproteins, which is consistent with a model in which  conformational changes induced by dimer-monomer conversion in Toc159 play a  direct role in facilitating preprotein import.', '2017 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.01952', 'ORCID:']
