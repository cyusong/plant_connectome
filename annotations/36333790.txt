Chrysanthemum seticuspe has emerged as a model plant species of cultivated chrysanthemums, especially for studies involving diploid and self-compatible pure lines (Gojo-0). Its genome was sequenced and assembled into chromosomes. However, the genome annotation of C. seticuspe still needs to be improved to elucidate the complex regulatory networks in this species. In addition to the 74,259 mRNAs annotated in the C. seticuspe genome, we identified 18,265 novel mRNAs, 51,425 novel lncRNAs, 501 novel miRNAs and 22,065 novel siRNAs. Two C-class genes and YABBY family genes were highly expressed in disc florets, while B-class genes were highly expressed in ray florets. A WGCNA was performed to identify the hub lncRNAs and mRNAs in ray floret- and disc floret-specific modules, and CDM19, BBX22, HTH, HSP70 and several lncRNAs were identified. ceRNA and lncNAT networks related to flower development were also constructed, and we found a latent functional lncNAT-mRNA combination, LXLOC_026470 and MIF2. The annotations of mRNAs, lncRNAs and small RNAs in the C. seticuspe genome have been improved. The expression profiles of flower development-related genes, ceRNA networks and lncNAT networks were identified, laying a foundation for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying disc floret and ray floret formation.
