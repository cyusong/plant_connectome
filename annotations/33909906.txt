Whole-genome duplication and post-polyploidization genome downsizing play key roles in the evolution of land plants; however, the impact of genomic diploidization on functional traits still remains poorly understood. Using Dianthus broteri as a model, we compared the ecophysiological behaviour of colchicine-induced neotetraploids (4xNeo) to diploids (2x) and naturally occurring tetraploids (4xNat). Leaf gas-exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence analyses were performed in order to asses to what extent post-polyploidization evolutionary processes have affected 4xNat. Genomic diploidization and phenotypic novelty were evident. Distinct patterns of variation revealed that post-polyploidization processes altered the phenotypic shifts directly mediated by genome doubling. The photosynthetic phenotype was affected in several ways but the main effect was phenotypic diploidization (i.e. 2x and 4xNat were closer to each other than to 4xNeo). Overall, our results show the potential benefits of considering experimentally synthetized versus naturally established polyploids when exploring the role of polyploidization in promoting functional divergence.
