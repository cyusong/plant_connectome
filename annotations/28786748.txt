Adaptor proteins (APs) mediate protein sorting within endomembrane compartments in eukaryotic cells. AP-3 is an ancient AP complex mediating vacuolar trafficking in different phyla. Only recently, a few tonoplast proteins have been identified as AP-3 cargos in Arabidopsis whereas the function of AP-3 was largely unexplored. Here, we summarize recent advances on AP-3 in Arabidopsis, pointing at the potential roles of AP-3 in plant development and cellular processes.
