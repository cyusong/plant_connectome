['16920782', 'The balance between cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation  needed to maintain the organogenetic program depends on the coordination of gene  expression, posttranslational modification, and specific proteolysis of cell  cycle regulators. The G1/S and G2/M transitions are critical checkpoints  controlled, in part, by cyclin-dependent kinases in the retinoblastoma  (RBR)/E2F/DP pathway. Arabidopsis thaliana DPB is regulated by phosphorylation  and targeted to proteasome-mediated proteolysis by the SCF(SKP2A) complex. In  addition, DPB interacts in vivo with E2FC, because ectopic coexpression of E2FC  and DPB produces severe developmental defects. To understand E2FC/DPB heterodimer  function, we analyzed the effect of reducing E2FC mRNA levels with RNA  interference. The e2fc-R plants developed organs with more but smaller cells and  showed increased cell cycle marker gene expression and increased proliferative  activity in developing leaves, meristems, and pericycle cells. This last feature  produces plants with more lateral roots, consistent with an E2FC role in  restricting lateral root initiation. The e2fc-R plants also show marked  reductions in ploidy levels of mature leaves. These results indicate that the  transition from cell division to the endocycle is sensitive to different  pathways, E2FC/DPB being one of them. Our results show that E2FC/DPB is a key  factor in controlling the balance between cell proliferation and the switch to  the endocycle program.', '2006 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.039651', 'Gutierrez']
