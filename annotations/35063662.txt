Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), an essential structural component of chlorophyll, is absorbed from the soil by roots and transported to shoots to support photosynthesis in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying root-to-shoot Mg<sup>2+</sup> translocation remain largely unknown. We describe here the identification of four plasma membrane (PM)-localized transporters, named Mg<sup>2+</sup> release transporters (MGRs), that are critical for root-to-shoot Mg transport in Arabidopsis. Functional complementation assays in a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-uptake-deficient bacterial strain confirmed that these MGRs conduct Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport. PM-localized MGRs (MGR4, MGR5, MGR6, and MGR7) were expressed primarily in root stellar cells and participated in the xylem loading step of the long-distance Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport process. In particular, MGR4 and MGR6 played a major role in shoot Mg homeostasis, as their loss-of-function mutants were hypersensitive to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> but tolerant to high Mg<sup>2+</sup> conditions. Reciprocal grafting analysis further demonstrated that MGR4 functions in the root to determine shoot Mg<sup>2+</sup> accumulation and physiological phenotypes caused by both low- and high-Mg<sup>2+</sup> stress. Taken together, our study has identified the long-sought transporters responsible for root-to-shoot Mg<sup>2+</sup> translocation in plants.
