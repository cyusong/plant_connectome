['12244056', 'Arabidopsis amino acid transporters (AAPs) show individual temporal and spatial  expression patterns. A new amino acid transporter, AAP8 was isolated by reverse  transcription-PCR. Growth and transport assays in comparison to AAP1-5  characterize AAP8 and AAP6 as high affinity amino acid transport systems from  Arabidopsis. Histochemical promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) studies identified  AAP6 expression in xylem parenchyma, cells requiring high affinity transport due  to the low amino acid concentration in xylem sap. AAP6 may thus function in  uptake of amino acids from xylem. Histochemical analysis of AAP8 revealed  stage-dependent expression in siliques and developing seeds. Thus AAP8 is  probably responsible for import of organic nitrogen into developing seeds. The  only missing transporter of the family AAP7 was nonfunctional in yeast with  respect to amino acid transport, and expression was not detectable. Therefore,  AAP6 and -8 are the only members of the family able to transport aspartate with  physiologically relevant affinity. AAP1, -6 and -8 are the closest AAP paralogs.  Although AAP1 and AAP8 originate from a duplicated region on chromosome I,  biochemical properties and expression pattern diverged. Overlapping substrate  specificities paired with individual properties and expression patterns point to  specific functions of each of the AAP genes in nitrogen distribution rather than  to mere redundancy.', '2002 Nov 22', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M207730200', 'Koch']
