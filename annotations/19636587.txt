ZmMRP-1 is a single MYB-domain transcription factor specifically expressed in the transfer cell layer of the maize endosperm, where it directly regulates the expression of a number of transfer cell specific genes and very likely contributes to the regulation of the transfer cell differentiation process. It is still a matter of debate, however, how this type of transcription factors interact with the promoter sequences they regulate. In this work we have investigated the existence of proteins interacting with ZmMRP-1 in the transfer cell nuclei. In a yeast double-hybrid screen we identified two related maize proteins, ZmMRPI-1 and ZmMRPI-2 belonging to the C(2)H(2) zinc finger protein family, which interact with ZmMRP-1 and modulate its activity on transfer cell specific promoters. Two ZmMRPI orthologous genes were also identified in the rice and Arabidopsis genomes. The expression pattern in maize and Arabidopsis suggest a role for these proteins in gene regulation at the exchange surfaces where ZmMRP-1 is expressed providing the first indication of their function. We show that this previously uncharacterized family of proteins encodes nuclear proteins that interact with MYB-related transcription factors through their C-terminal conserved domain.
