A sweet pepper cDNA clone, CaHSP26 encoding the chloroplast (CP)-localized small heat shock protein (sHSP), was isolated and characterized with regard to its sequence, response to various temperatures and function in transgenic tobacco plants. The deduced amino acid sequence contained three highly conserved regions, showing high identities with other plant sHSPs. Expression of the CaHSP26 gene showed that the mRNA accumulation of CaHSP26 was induced by heat stress. Higher transcript levels were observed when sweet pepper leaves were treated at 42 degrees C for 3h. However, the expression of the CaHSP26 gene was not induced by chilling stress (4 degrees C) in the absence of heat shock (HS). But the transcripts were still detected at 48h at 4 degrees C after HS while not at 25 degrees C. The photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) and the oxidizable P700 in transgenic tobacco overexpressing CaHSP26 were higher than that in wild type tobacco during chilling stress under low irradiance. These results suggest that CP sHSP protein plays an important role in protection of PSII and PSI during chilling stress under low irradiance.
