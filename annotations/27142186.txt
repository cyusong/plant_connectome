Protein import into chloroplasts has been a focus of research for several decades. The first publications dealing with this fascinating topic appeared in the 1970s. From the initial realization that many plastid proteins are being encoded for in the nucleus and require transport into their target organelle to the identification of import components in the cytosol, chloroplast envelopes, and stroma, as well as elucidation of some mechanistic details, more fascinating aspects are still being unraveled. With this overview, we present a survey of the beginnings of chloroplast protein import research, the first steps on this winding road, and end with a glimpse into the future.
