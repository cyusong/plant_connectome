Genetic improvement of plant architecture is one of the strategies for increasing the yield potential of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Although great progress has been made in the understanding of plant architecture regulation, the precise mechanism is still an urgent need to be revealed. Here, we report that over-expression of <i>OsMIR396d</i> in rice results in semidwarf and increased leaf angle, a typical phenotype of brassinosteroid (BR) enhanced mutant. OsmiR396d is involved in the interaction network of BR and gibberellin (GA) signaling. In <i>OsMIR396d</i> over-expression plants, BR signaling was enhanced. In contrast, both the signaling and biosynthesis of GA were impaired. BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1, a core transcription activator of BR signaling, directly promoted the accumulation of OsmiR396d, which controlled BR response and GA biosynthesis by regulating the expression of different target genes respectively. <i>GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR 6</i>, one of OsmiR396d targets, participated in GA biosynthesis and signal transduction but was not directly involved in BR signaling. This study provides a new insight into the understanding of interaction between BR and GA from multiple levels on controlling plant architecture.
