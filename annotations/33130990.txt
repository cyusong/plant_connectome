The Arabidopsis transcription factor NAC103 is up-regulated and its encoding protein is stabilized by ABA treatment, which positively regulates several ABA-responsive downstream genes during seed germination and seedlings growth. The Arabidopsis transcription factor NAC103 was previously found to be involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and DNA damage responses. In this study, we report the new biological function of NAC103 in abscisic acid (ABA) response during seed germination and seedling growth in Arabidopsis. The expression of NAC103 was up-regulated and the NAC103 protein was stabilized by ABA treatment. Both the loss-of-function mutants of NAC103, created by targeted gene-editing, and the over-expression plants of NAC103 have no obvious germination-related phenotype under normal growth conditions. However, under exogenous ABA treatment conditions, the NAC103 mutants were less sensitive to ABA during seed germination; in contrast, the NAC103 over-expression plants were more sensitive to ABA during seed germination and young seedling growth. Further, NAC103 regulated several ABA-responsive downstream genes including MYB78, MYB3, PLP3, AMY1, and RGL2. These results demonstrate that NAC103 positively regulates ABA response in Arabidopsis.
