Rice cultivars vary widely in their sensitivity to ultraviolet B (UVB) and this has been correlated with cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase mutations that alter the structure/function of this photorepair enzyme. Here, we tested whether CPD photolyase function determines the UVB sensitivity of rice (Oryza sativa) by generating transgenic rice plants bearing the CPD photolyase gene of the UV-resistant rice cultivar Sasanishiki in the sense orientation (S-B and S-C lines) or the antisense orientation (AS-D line). The S-B and S-C plants had 5.1- and 45.7-fold higher CPD photolyase activities than the wild-type, respectively, were significantly more resistant to UVB-induced growth damage, and maintained significantly lower CPD levels in their leaves during growth under elevated UVB radiation. Conversely, the AS-D plant had little photolyase activity, was severely damaged by elevated UVB radiation, and maintained higher CPD levels in its leaves during growth under UVB radiation. Notably, the S-C plant was not more resistant to UVB-induced growth inhibition than the S-B plant, even though it had much higher CPD photolyase activity. These results strongly indicate that UVB-induced CPDs are one of principal causes of UVB-induced growth inhibition in rice plants grown under supplementary UVB radiation, and that increasing CPD photolyase activity can significantly alleviate UVB-caused growth inhibition in rice. However, further protection from UVB-induced damage may require the genetic enhancement of other systems as well.
