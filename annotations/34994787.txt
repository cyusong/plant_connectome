Triacylglycerol is a key lipid compound involved in maintaining homeostasis of both membrane lipids and free fatty acids (FFA) in plant cells under adverse environmental conditions. However, its role in the process of lipid remodeling has not been fully recognized, especially in monocots, including grass species. For our study, two closely related introgression forms of Lolium multiflorum (Italian ryegrass) and Festuca arundinacea (tall fescue), distinct in their level of drought tolerance, were selected as plant models to study rearrangements in plant lipidome under water deficit and further re-watering. The low drought tolerant (LDT) form revealed an elevated level of cellular membrane damage accompanied by an increased content of polyunsaturated FFA and triacylglycerol under water deficit, compared with the high drought tolerant (HDT) form. However, the LDT introgression form demonstrated also the ability to regenerate its membranes after stress cessation. The obtained results clearly indicated that accumulation of triacylglycerol under advanced drought in the LDT form could serve as a cellular protective mechanism against overaccumulation of toxic polyunsaturated FFA and other lipid intermediates. Furthermore, accumulation of triacylglycerol under drought conditions could serve also as storage of substrates required for further regeneration of membranes after stress cessation. The rearrangements in triacylglycerol metabolism were supported by the upregulation of several genes, involved in a biosynthesis of triacylglycerol. With respect to this process, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase DGAT2 seems to play the most important role in the analyzed grasses.
