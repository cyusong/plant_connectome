Many medicinal plant species are currently threatened in their natural habitats because of the growing demand for phytochemicals worldwide. A sustainable alternative for the production of bioactive plant compounds are plant biofactories based on cell cultures and organs. In addition, plant extracts from biofactories have significant advantages over those obtained from plants, since they are free of contamination by microorganisms, herbicides and pesticides, and they provide more stable levels of active ingredients. In this context, we report the establishment of <i>Satureja khuzistanica</i> cell cultures able to produce high amounts of rosmarinic acid (RA). The production of this phytopharmaceutical was increased when the cultures were elicited with coronatine and scaled up to a benchtop bioreactor. <i>S. khuzistanica</i> extracts enriched in RA were found to reduce the viability of cancer cell lines, increasing the sub-G0/G1 cell population and the activity of caspase-8 in MCF-7 cells, which suggest that <i>S. khuzistanica</i> extracts can induce apoptosis of MCF-7 cells through activation of the extrinsic pathway. In addition, our findings indicate that other compounds in <i>S. khuzistanica</i> extracts may act synergistically to potentiate the anticancer activity of RA.
