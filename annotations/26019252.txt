Plant sexual reproduction involves highly structured and specialized organs: stamens (male) and gynoecia (female, containing ovules). These organs synchronously develop within protective flower buds, until anthesis, via tightly coordinated mechanisms that are essential for effective fertilization and production of viable seeds. The phytohormone auxin is one of the key endogenous signalling molecules controlling initiation and development of these, and other, plant organs. In particular, its uneven distribution, resulting from tightly controlled production, metabolism and directional transport, is an important morphogenic factor. In this review we discuss how developmentally controlled and localized auxin biosynthesis and transport contribute to the coordinated development of plants' reproductive organs, and their fertilized derivatives (embryos) via the regulation of auxin levels and distribution within and around them. Current understanding of the links between de novo local auxin biosynthesis, auxin transport and/or signalling is presented to highlight the importance of the non-cell autonomous action of auxin production on development and morphogenesis of reproductive organs and embryos. An overview of transcription factor families, which spatiotemporally define local auxin production by controlling key auxin biosynthetic enzymes, is also presented.
