Geminiviruses constitute one of the largest families of plant viruses and they infect many economically important crops. The proteins encoded by the single-stranded DNA genome of these viruses interact with a wide range of host proteins to cause global dysregulation of cellular processes and help establish infection in the host. Geminiviruses have evolved numerous mechanisms to exploit host epigenetic processes to ensure the replication and survival of the viral genome. Here, we review our current knowledge of diverse epigenetic processes that have been implicated in the regulation of geminivirus pathogenesis, including DNA methylation, histone post-transcriptional modification, chromatin remodelling, and nucleosome repositioning. In addition, we discuss the currently limited evidence of host epigenetic defence responses that are aimed at counteracting geminivirus infection, and the potential for exploiting these responses for the generation of resistance against geminiviruses in crop species.
