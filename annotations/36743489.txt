Membrane transporters encoded by <i>NITRATE TRANSPORTER 1/PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER</i> (<i>NPF</i>) genes, which play crucial roles in plant growth, development and resistance to various stresses, are involved in the transport of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>) and peptides. In several plant species, <i>NPF</i> genes are involved in the resistance to abiotic stresses; however, whether the whole <i>NPF</i> gene family in cotton contributes to this resistance has not been systematically investigated. Here, 201 genes encoding <i>NPF</i> proteins with a peptide transporter (PTR) domain were confirmed in three different <i>Gossypium</i> species, namely, <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>, <i>Gossypium arboreum</i> and <i>Gossypium raimondii</i>. The NPF proteins in these three <i>Gossypium</i> species and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> were classified into three different subfamilies <i>via</i> phylogenetic analysis. Among the genes that encode these proteins, most <i>GhNPF</i> genes in the same subfamily contained similar gene structures and conserved domains. Predictions of the promoters of these genes revealed that the cis-acting elements included phytohormone- and light-responsive elements, indicating that some of these genes might be expressed in response to abiotic stress. Furthermore, 52 common potential candidate genes in 98 <i>GhNPFs</i> were predicted to exhibit specific spatiotemporal expression patterns in different tissues based on two RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets. Finally, the gene expression profiles of abiotic stress indicated that 31 <i>GhNPF</i> genes were upregulated in at least one treatment period. Under abiotic stress for 12 and 24 h, the expression of <i>GhNPF8</i> was upregulated upon cold treatment but downregulated with heat treatment, salt treatment and drought treatment. Furthermore, the expression of genes <i>GhNPF8, GhNPF54</i> and <i>GhNPF43</i> peaked at 6 h after heat and salt treatment. These results indicated that these genes exhibit underlying characteristics related to responses to abiotic stress. The verification of <i>NPFs</i> and analysis of their expression profiles in different tissues and in response to different abiotic stresses of cotton provide a basis for further studying the relationship between abiotic stress resistance and nitrogen (N) transport in cotton, as well as identifying candidate genes to facilitate their functional identification.
