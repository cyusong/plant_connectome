Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) is one of essential mineral elements for plant growth and development. K<sup>+</sup> channels, especially AKT1-like channels, play crucial roles in K<sup>+</sup> uptake in plant roots. Maize is one of important crops; however, the K<sup>+</sup> uptake mechanism in maize is little known. Here, we report the physiological functions of K<sup>+</sup> channel ZMK1 in K<sup>+</sup> uptake and homeostasis in maize. <i>ZMK1</i> is a homolog of <i>Arabidopsis AKT1</i> channel in maize, and mainly expressed in maize root. Yeast complementation experiments and electrophysiological characterization in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes indicated that ZMK1 could mediate K<sup>+</sup> uptake. <i>ZMK1</i> rescued the low-K<sup>+</sup>-sensitive phenotype of <i>akt1</i> mutant and enhanced K<sup>+</sup> uptake in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Overexpression of <i>ZMK1</i> also significantly increased K<sup>+</sup> uptake activity in maize, but led to an oversensitive phenotype. Similar to AKT1 regulation, the protein kinase ZmCIPK23 interacted with ZMK1 and phosphorylated the cytosolic region of ZMK1, activating ZMK1-mediated K<sup>+</sup> uptake. <i>ZmCIPK23</i> could also complement the low-K<sup>+</sup>-sensitive phenotype of <i>Arabidopsis cipk23</i>/<i>lks1</i> mutant. These findings demonstrate that ZMK1 together with ZmCIPK23 plays important roles in K<sup>+</sup> uptake and homeostasis in maize.
