Allium sativum (garlic) is an economically important food source and medicinal plant rich in sulfides and other protective substances such as alliin, the precursor of allicin biosynthesis. Cysteine, serine and sulfur is the precursor of alliin biosynthesis. However, little is known about the alliin content under abiotic stress or the mechanism by which it is synthesized. The findings revealed that the content of alliin was lowest in the garlic roots, and highest in the buds. Furthermore, alliin levels decreased in mature leaves following wounding. Transcriptome data generated over time after wounding further revealed significant up-regulation of genes integral to the biosynthetic pathways of cysteine and serine in mature garlic leaves. The findings suggest that differential expression of cysteine, serine and sulfide-related genes underlies the accumulation of alliin and its precursors in garlic, providing a basis for further analyses of alliin biosynthesis.
