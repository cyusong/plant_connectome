Glucose is an important building component in organisms and a central molecule of energy metabolism. It is also a key signaling molecule involved in regulation of many physiologic processes, including organism morphogenesis, anabolism and catabolism, pest and disease stress, environmental stress response. The signal transduction pathway mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins is one of the most important pathways for <i>Arabidopsis</i> to recognize, perceive and transduce external stimuli. AtRGS1 (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> regulator of G-protein signaling) metabolism is currently thought to be through endosome.This paper introduces relationship between autophagy and RGS1.
