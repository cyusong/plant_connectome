Carotenoids play essential roles in various light-harvesting processes in plants and help protect the photosynthetic machinery from photo-oxidative damage. Orange genes, which play a role in carotenoid accumulation, have recently been isolated from several plant species, and their functions have been intensively investigated. The Orange gene (IbOr) of sweet potato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam] helps maintain carotenoid homeostasis to improve plant tolerance to environmental stress. IbOr, a protein with strong holdase chaperone activity, directly interacts with phytoene synthase, a key enzyme involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, in plants under stress conditions, resulting in increased carotenoid accumulation and abiotic stress tolerance. In addition, IbOr interacts with the oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 2-1, a member of a protein complex in photosystem II that is denatured under heat stress. Transgenic sweet potato plants overexpressing IbOr showed enhanced tolerance to high temperatures (47 °C). These findings indicate that IbOr protects plants from environmental stress not only by controlling carotenoid biosynthesis, but also by directly stabilizing photosystem II. In this review, we discuss the functions of IbOr and Or proteins in other plant species and their possible biotechnological applications for molecular breeding for sustainable development on marginal lands.
