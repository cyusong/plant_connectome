GH3 genes are main components of the hormonal mechanism regulating growth and development and, hence, are deeply involved in a broad range of physiological processes. They are implicated in hormonal homeostasis through the conjugation to amino acids of the free form of essential plant growth regulators such as indoleacetic and jasmonic acids. In this work, we showed that OsGH3.1 overexpression in rice caused dwarfism and significantly reduced both free auxin content and cell elongation. Functional classification of the transcriptomic profiling revealed that most genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and auxin signaling inhibition were induced and repressed, respectively. Many genes related to cell organization and biogenesis were also significantly downregulated. The survey also showed that, although the response to abiotic stresses was not clearly stimulated, OsGH3.1 overexpression did activate a significant number of defense-related genes. In successive bioassays, it was demonstrated that the resistance of rice plants to pathogen infection, evaluated with two different Magnaporthe grisea strains, was higher in the transformants overexpressing OsGH3.1. Taken together, these results indicate that OsGH3.1 overexpression reduces auxin content, inhibits cell growth and cell wall loosening, and enhances resistance to a fungal pathogen. Our results provide evidence that auxin homeostasis can regulate the activation of the defense response in rice.
