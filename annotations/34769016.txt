The genome is the most functional part of a cell, and genomic contents are organized in a compact three-dimensional (3D) structure. The genome contains millions of nucleotide bases organized in its proper frame. Rapid development in genome sequencing and advanced microscopy techniques have enabled us to understand the 3D spatial organization of the genome. Chromosome capture methods using a ligation approach and the visualization tool of a 3D genome browser have facilitated detailed exploration of the genome. Topologically associated domains (TADs), lamin-associated domains, CCCTC-binding factor domains, cohesin, and chromatin structures are the prominent identified components that encode the 3D structure of the genome. Although TADs are the major contributors to 3D genome organization, they are absent in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. However, a few research groups have reported the presence of TAD-like structures in the plant kingdom.
