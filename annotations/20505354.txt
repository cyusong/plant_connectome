We recently identified a new component of flavonoid transport pathways in Arabidopsis. The MATE protein FFT (Flower Flavonoid Transporter) is primarily found in guard cells and seedling roots, and mutation of the transporter results in floral and growth phenotypes. The nature of FFT's substrate requires further exploration but our data suggest that it is a kaempferol diglucoside. Here we discuss potential partner H(+)-ATPases and possible redundancy among the close homologues within the large Arabidopsis MATE family.
