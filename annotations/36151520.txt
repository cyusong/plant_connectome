Pinellia ternata is an important traditional medicine in China, and its growth is regulated by the transcriptome or proteome. Lysine crotonylation, a newly identified and important type of posttranslational modification, plays a key role in many aspects of cell metabolism. However, little is known about its functions in Pinellia ternata. In this study, we generated a global crotonylome analysis of Pinellia ternata and examined its overlap with lysine succinylation. A total of 2106 crotonylated sites matched on 1006 proteins overlapping in three independent tests were identified, and we found three specific amino acids surrounding crotonylation sites in Pinellia ternata: K<sup>cr</sup>F, K***Y**K<sup>cr</sup> and K<sup>cr</sup>****R. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that two crucial alkaloid biosynthesis-related enzymes and many stress-related proteins were also highly crotonylated. Furthermore, several enzymes participating in carbohydrate metabolism pathways were found to exhibit both lysine crotonylation and succinylation modifications. These results indicate that lysine crotonylation performs important functions in many biological processes in Pinellia ternata, especially in the biosynthesis of alkaloids, and some metabolic pathways are simultaneously regulated by lysine crotonylation and succinylation.
