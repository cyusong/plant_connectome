['22786886', 'Mutations in human (Homo sapiens) ETHYLMALONIC ENCEPHALOPATHY PROTEIN1 (ETHE1)  result in the complex metabolic disease ethylmalonic encephalopathy, which is  characterized in part by brain lesions, lactic acidemia, excretion of  ethylmalonic acid, and ultimately death. ETHE1-like genes are found in a wide  range of organisms; however, the biochemical and physiological role(s) of ETHE1  have not been examined outside the context of ethylmalonic encephalopathy. In  this study we characterized Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ETHE1 and  determined the effect of an ETHE1 loss-of-function mutation to investigate the  role(s) of ETHE1 in plants. Arabidopsis ETHE1 is localized in the mitochondrion  and exhibits sulfur dioxygenase activity. Seeds homozygous for a DNA insertion in  ETHE1 exhibit alterations in endosperm development that are accompanied by a  delay in embryo development followed by embryo arrest by early heart stage.  Strong ETHE1 labeling was observed in the peripheral and chalazal endosperm of  wild-type seeds prior to cellularization. Therefore, ETHE1 appears to play an  essential role in regulating sulfide levels in seeds.', '2012 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.201855', 'Makaroff']
