The increasing numbers of taxonomically unassigned phylotypes reported in molecular ecological studies contrast with the few formally described arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; Glomeromycota). Here, a species new to science with Glomus-like spores is phylogenetically, morphologically and ecologically characterized. From single spore isolates of a previously recognized member of the Diversisporaceae from Swiss agricultural grassland, 17 new nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS), large subunit (LSU) and small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences were determined and compared with 14 newly generated sequences of two close relatives and public database sequences, including environmental sequences, of known geographic origin. SSU ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence signatures and phylogenies based on ITS, LSU and SSU rDNA sequences show that the fungus belongs to the genus Diversispora. It is described as Diversispora celata sp. nov. Comparison with environmental sequences in the public domain confirmed its molecular genetic distinctiveness and revealed a cross-continental distribution of close relatives. The value of combining morphology and phylogeny to characterize AMF was reinforced by the morphological similarity to other species and the inconspicuous nature of D. celata spores and mycorrhizas. Inclusion of all three nuclear rDNA regions in species descriptions will facilitate species determination from environmental phylotypes.
