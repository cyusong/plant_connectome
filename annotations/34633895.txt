Seed germination is a vital initial stage in the life cycle of a plant, which determines subsequent vegetative growth and reproduction. Melatonin acts as a plant's master regulator and is also involved in the process of seed germination. In a recent study, we show that the high concentration melatonin inhibited seed germination in Arabidopsis. Transcriptome and phenotype analysis implied that melatonin-mediated seed germination interacted with phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), and auxin. In this short communication, we discuss the mechanism of phytomelatonin that inhibits seed germination through ABA, GA, and IAA in Arabidopsis.
