Wild-type tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Petit Havanna line SR1) and plants transformed with full-length alfalfa ferritin cDNA with the chloroplast transit peptide under the control of a Rubisco small subunit gene promoter (C3 and C8) were cold-treated at 0 degrees C with continuous light (250 micromol m(-2)s(-1)). These transgenic plants had higher chlorophyll content and higher F(v)/F(m) chlorophyll-a fluorescence induction parameters than wild-type plants after 2 or 3d of cold treatment in C3 and C8 transgenic plants, respectively. Thermoluminescence studies on the high-temperature bands suggest that these plants suffered less oxidative damage in comparison to the wild-type genotype. The present experiments provide evidence that transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing alfalfa ferritin, which is accumulated in the chloroplasts, may show higher tolerance to various stress factors, generating ROS including low temperature-induced photoinhibition.
