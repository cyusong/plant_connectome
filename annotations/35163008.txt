Drought is one of the major constraints to rain-fed agricultural production, especially under climate change conditions. Plants evolved an array of adaptive strategies that perceive stress stimuli and respond to these stress signals through specific mechanisms. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a premier signal for plants to respond to drought and plays a critical role in plant growth and development. ABA triggers a variety of physiological processes such as stomatal closure, root system modulation, organizing soil microbial communities, activation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression, and metabolic alterations. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of ABA-mediated drought responses in plants is critical for ensuring crop yield and global food security. In this review, we highlighted how plants adjust ABA perception, transcriptional levels of ABA- and drought-related genes, and regulation of metabolic pathways to alter drought stress responses at both cellular and the whole plant level. Understanding the synergetic role of drought and ABA will strengthen our knowledge to develop stress-resilient crops through integrated advanced biotechnology approaches. This review will elaborate on ABA-mediated drought responses at genetic, biochemical, and molecular levels in plants, which is critical for advancement in stress biology research.
