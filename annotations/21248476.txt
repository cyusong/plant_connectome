The multi-subunit complex Elongator interacts with elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and is thought to facilitate transcription through histone acetylation. Elongator is conserved in eukaryotes, yet functions in diverse kingdom-specific processes. In this mini-review, we discuss the known functions of Elongator in plants, including its roles in development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. We propose that Elongator functions in these processes by accelerating gene induction in response to changing cellular and environmental conditions.
