Isoprene and nitric oxide (NO) are two volatile molecules that are produced in leaves. Both compounds were suggested to have an important protective role against stresses. We tested, in two isoprene-emitting species, Populus nigra and Phragmites australis, whether: (1) NO emission outside leaves is measurable and is affected by oxidative stresses; and (2) isoprene and NO protect leaves against oxidative stresses, both singularly and in combination. The emission of NO was undetectable, and the compensation point was very low in control poplar leaves. Both emission and compensation point increased dramatically in stressed leaves. NO emission was inversely associated with stomatal conductance. More NO was emitted in leaves that were isoprene-inhibited, and more isoprene was emitted when NO was reduced by NO scavenger c-PTIO. Both isoprene and NO reduced oxidative damages. Isoprene-emitting leaves which were also fumigated with NO, or treated with NO donor, showed low damage to photosynthesis, a reduced accumulation of H(2)O(2) and a reduced membrane denaturation. We conclude that measurable amounts of NO are only produced and emitted by stressed leaves, that both isoprene and NO are effective antioxidant molecules and that an additional protection is achieved when both molecules are released.
