['14871316', 'We report characterization of SUPERROOT1 (SUR1) as the C-S lyase in glucosinolate  biosynthesis. This is evidenced by selective metabolite profiling of sur1, which  is completely devoid of aliphatic and indole glucosinolates. Furthermore,  following in vivo feeding with radiolabeled p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime to the  sur1 mutant, the corresponding C-S lyase substrate accumulated. C-S lyase  activity of recombinant SUR1 heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli was  demonstrated using the C-S lyase substrate djenkolic acid. The abolishment of  glucosinolates in sur1 indicates that the SUR1 function is not redundant and thus  SUR1 constitutes a single gene family. This suggests that the "high-auxin"  phenotype of sur1 is caused by accumulation of endogenous C-S lyase substrates as  well as aldoximes, including indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) that is channeled into  the main auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Thereby, the cause of the "high-auxin"  phenotype of sur1 mutant resembles that of two other "high-auxin" mutants,  superroot2 (sur2) and yucca1. Our findings provide important insight to the  critical role IAOx plays in auxin homeostasis as a key branching point between  primary and secondary metabolism, and define a framework for further dissection  of auxin biosynthesis.', '2004 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313x.2004.02002.x', 'Halkier']
