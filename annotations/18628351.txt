['18628351', 'We provide evidence on the localization, synthesis, transport, and effects of  auxin on the processes occurring late in Arabidopsis thaliana stamen development:  anther dehiscence, pollen maturation, and preanthesis filament elongation.  Expression of auxin-sensitive reporter constructs suggests that auxin effects  begin in anthers between the end of meiosis and the bilocular stage in the  somatic tissues involved in the first step of dehiscence as well as in the  microspores and in the junction region between anther and filament. In situ  hybridizations of the auxin biosynthetic genes YUC2 and YUC6 suggest that auxin  is synthesized in anthers. In agreement with the timing of auxin effects, the  TIR1, AFB1, AFB2, and AFB3 auxin receptor-encoding genes are transcribed in  anthers only during late stages of development starting at the end of meiosis. We  found that in tir1 afb triple and quadruple mutants, anther dehiscence and pollen  maturation occur earlier than in the wild type, causing the release of mature  pollen grains before the completion of filament elongation. We also assessed the  contribution of auxin transport to late stamen developmental processes. Our  results suggest that auxin synthesized in anthers plays a major role in  coordinating anther dehiscence and pollen maturation, while auxin transport  contributes to the independent regulation of preanthesis filament elongation.', '2008 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.057570', 'Cardarelli']
