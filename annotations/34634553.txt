Carbohydrate partitioning, the process of transporting carbohydrates from photosynthetic (source) tissues, such as leaves, to non-photosynthetic (sink) tissues, such as stems, roots, and reproductive structures, is vital not only for the growth and development of plants but also for withstanding biotic and abiotic stress. In many plants, sucrose is the primary form of carbohydrate loaded into the phloem for long-distance transport and unloaded into the sink tissues for utilization or storage. We highlight recent findings about 1) phloem loading in grasses, 2) the principal families of sugar transporters involved in sucrose transport, and 3) novel mechanisms by which the activities of sugar transporters are modulated. We discuss exciting discoveries from eudicot species that provide valuable insights regarding the regulation of these sugar transporters, which may be translatable to monocot species. As we better understand the intricate pathways that control the activities of various sugar transporters, we can utilize this knowledge for developing improved crop varieties.
