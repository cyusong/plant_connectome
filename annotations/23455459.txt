The Arabidopsis thaliana DDM1 (Decreased DNA Methylation) gene is necessary for the maintenance of DNA methylation and heterochromatin assembly. In Arabidopsis, ddm1 mutants exhibit strong but delayed morphological phenotypes. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress transcripts of two orthologous DDM1 paralogs in Populus trichocarpa and examined effects on whole plant phenotypes during perennial growth and seasonal dormancy. The RNAi-PtDDM1 transgenic poplars showed a wide range of DDM1 transcript suppression; the most strongly suppressed line had 37.5 % of the expression of the non-transgenic control. Genomic cytosine methylation (mC %) was 11.1 % in the non-transgenic control, compared with 9.1 % for the transgenic event with lowest mC %, a reduction of 18.1 %. An evaluation of greenhouse growth directly after acclimation of in vitro grown plants showed no developmental or growth rate abnormalities associated with the decrease in PtDDM1 expression. However, after a dormancy cycle and growth outdoors, a mottled leaf phenotype appeared in some of the transgenic insertion events that had strongly reduced PtDDM1 expression and DNA methylation. The phenotypic consequences of reduced DDM1 activity and DNA methylation appears to increase with cumulative plant propagation and growth.

DDM1: !maintains! DNA methylation
RNAi: !suppresses! DDM1 transcripts
PtDDM1: !reduces! mC %
mC %: !decreases! with PtDDM1 expression
PtDDM1: !causes! mottled leaf phenotype
