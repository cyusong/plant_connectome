Tillering is a critical agronomic trait of wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) that determines the shoot architecture and affects grain yield. <i>TERMINAL FLOWER 1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>), encoding a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, is implicated in the transition to flowering and shoot architecture in plant development. However, the roles of TFL1 homologs is little known in wheat development. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis was used in this study to generate a set of wheat (Fielder) mutants with single, double or triple-null <i>tatfl1-5</i> alleles. The wheat <i>tatfl1-5</i> mutations decreased the tiller number per plant in the vegetative growth stage and the effective tiller number per plant and spikelet number per spike at maturity in the field. RNA-seq analysis showed that the expression of the auxin signaling-related and cytokinin signaling-related genes was significantly changed in the axillary buds of <i>tatfl1-5</i> mutant seedlings. The results suggested that wheat <i>TaTFL1-5s</i> were implicated in tiller regulation by auxin and cytokinin signaling.
