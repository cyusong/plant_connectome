Xylem flow of water into fruits declines during fruit development, and the literature indicates a corresponding increase in hydraulic resistance in the pedicel. However, it is unknown how pedicel hydraulics change developmentally in relation to xylem anatomy and function. In this study on grape (Vitis vinifera), we determined pedicel hydraulic conductivity (kh) from pressure-flow relationships using hydrostatic and osmotic forces and investigated xylem anatomy and function using fluorescent light microscopy and x-ray computed microtomography. Hydrostatic kh (xylem pathway) was consistently 4 orders of magnitude greater than osmotic kh (intracellular pathway), but both declined before veraison by approximately 40% and substantially over fruit development. Hydrostatic kh declined most gradually for low (less than 0.08 MPa) pressures and for water inflow and outflow conditions. Specific kh (per xylem area) decreased in a similar fashion to kh despite substantial increases in xylem area. X-ray computed microtomography images provided direct evidence that losses in pedicel kh were associated with blockages in vessel elements, whereas air embolisms were negligible. However, vessel elements were interconnected and some remained continuous postveraison, suggesting that across the grape pedicel, a xylem pathway of reduced kh remains functional late into berry ripening.

Xylem flow: !declines! during fruit development
Hydraulic resistance: !increases! in pedicel
Hydraulic conductivity: !decreases! before veraison
Hydrostatic kh: !decreases! gradually for low pressures
Specific kh: !decreases! similarly to kh
Vessel elements: !blockages cause losses! in pedicel kh
Xylem pathway: !remains functional! late into berry ripening
