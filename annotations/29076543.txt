SARD1 is an activator of plant immunity that promotes production of the hormone salicylic acid (SA) and activation of defense gene expression. SARD1 itself is strongly inducible by infection. Here, we investigated the transcriptional control of SARD1. We used yeast one-hybrid assays to identify WRKY70. The WRKY70 binding site was defined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and its importance was investigated using an Arabidopsis thaliana protoplast system. The effect of wrky70 mutations was studied by measurements of pathogen growth, SA concentrations, and gene expression by RNA-seq. WRKY70 binds to a GACTTTT motif in the SARD1 promoter in yeast and Arabidopsis protoplasts. Plants with wrky70 mutations have elevated expression of SARD1 in the absence of pathogens, but not when infected. Expression profiling revealed that WRKY70 represses many pathogen-inducible genes in the absence of pathogens, yet is required for activation of many other pathogen-inducible genes in infected plants. The GACTTTT motif is enriched in the promoters of both these gene sets, and conserved in SARD1 orthologs within the Brassicaceae. WRKY70 represses SARD1 by binding the motif GACTTTT in the absence of pathogens. Conservation of the WRKY70 binding among the Brassicaceae suggests that WRKY70 repression of SARD1 is important for fitness.
