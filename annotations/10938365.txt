['10938365', 'A Ca(2+)-ATPase was purified from plasma membranes (PM) isolated from Arabidopsis  cultured cells by calmodulin (CaM)-affinity chromatography. Three tryptic  fragments from the protein were microsequenced and the corresponding cDNA was  amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers designed from the  microsequences of the tryptic fragments. At-ACA8 (Arabidopsis-autoinhibited  Ca(2+)-ATPase, isoform 8, accession no. AJ249352) encodes a 1,074 amino acid  protein with 10 putative transmembrane domains, which contains all of the  characteristic motifs of Ca(2+)-transporting P-type Ca(2+)-ATPases. The identity  of At-ACA8p as the PM Ca(2+)-ATPase was confirmed by immunodetection with an  antiserum raised against a sequence (valine-17 through threonine-31) that is not  found in other plant CaM-stimulated Ca(2+)-ATPases. Confocal fluorescence  microscopy of protoplasts immunodecorated with the same antiserum confirmed the  PM localization of At-ACA8. At-ACA8 is the first plant PM localized Ca(2+)-ATPase  to be cloned and is clearly distinct from animal PM Ca(2+)-ATPases due to the  localization of its CaM-binding domain. CaM overlay assays localized the  CaM-binding domain of At-ACA8p to a region of the N terminus of the enzyme around  tryptophan-47, in contrast to a C-terminal localization for its animal  counterparts. Comparison between the sequence of At-ACA8p and those of  endomembrane-localized type IIB Ca(2+)-ATPases of plants suggests that At-ACA8 is  a representative of a new subfamily of plant type IIB Ca(2+)-ATPases.', '2000 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.123.4.1495', 'De']
