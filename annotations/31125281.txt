<i>Alternaria alternata</i> is a generally saprophytic fungus. Its genome consists of 10 autosomes, while some strains have one or two additional chromosomes, called a conditionally dispensable chromosome (CDC). A CDC is not required for reproduction but confers host-specific pathogenicity. We sequenced the genome of the peach pathotype of <i>A. alternata</i> using Nanopore and assembled it into 20 sequences. The 10 largest sequences corresponded to 10 gapless sequences of <i>A. solani</i> autosomes, and 1 sequence was a mitochondrial genome. Nine other sequences may be derived from CDCs because of lack of similarity with autosomes of other <i>Alternaria</i> spp. The sequence information could provide novel insights into genomes of <i>Alternaria</i> spp. and on the biosynthesis of a novel host-specific toxin in the peach pathotype of <i>A. alternata</i>.
