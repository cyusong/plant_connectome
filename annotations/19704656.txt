MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 165 and 166 are able to cleave their target mRNAs of HD-ZIP III genes, thus regulating the functions of these genes. Although it is generally accepted that both miR165 and miR166 perform the same functions in the regulation of HD-ZIP III genes in Arabidopsis, no experimental data are available to support this notion. Recent work has shown that overexpression of miR166 downregulates the expression of three HD-ZIP III genes, ATHB-9/PHV, ATHB-14/PHB and ATHB-15, which in turn recapitulates the phenotypes of simultaneous loss-of-function mutations of these genes. In the March issue of Plant & Cell Physiology, we have demonstrated that overexpression of miR165 leads to the down-regulation of all five HD-ZIP III genes, and concomitantly recapitulates the phenotypes of loss-of-function mutation of IFL1/REV and those of simultaneous loss-of-function mutations of IFL1/REV, ATHB-9/PHV and ATHB-14/PHB. These results indicate that miR165 and miR166 differentially regulate the functions of HD-ZIP III genes in Arabidopsis. In this addendum, we show that overexpression of the antisense form of the miR165a gene leads to formation of amphivasal vascular bundles, a phenotype reminiscent of that of the dominant mutation of IFL1/REV. This finding provides direct evidence for a role of miR165 in regulation of vascular patterning.
