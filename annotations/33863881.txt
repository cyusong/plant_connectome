Vernalization genes underlying dramatic differences in flowering time between spring wheat and winter wheat have been studied extensively, but little is known about genes that regulate subtler differences in flowering time among winter wheat cultivars, which account for approximately 75% of wheat grown worldwide. Here, we identify a gene encoding an O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) that differentiates heading date between winter wheat cultivars Duster and Billings. We clone this TaOGT1 gene from a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for heading date in a mapping population derived from these two bread wheat cultivars and analyzed in various environments. Transgenic complementation analysis shows that constitutive overexpression of TaOGT1b from Billings accelerates the heading of transgenic Duster plants. TaOGT1 is able to transfer an O-GlcNAc group to wheat protein TaGRP2. Our findings establish important roles for TaOGT1 in winter wheat in adaptation to global warming in the future climate scenarios.
