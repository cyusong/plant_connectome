Osmotic stress caused by drought and high salinity is the key factor limiting plant growth. However, its underlying molecular regulatory mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we found the stress-related gene Zm00001d019704 (<i>ZmSRG7</i>) based on transcriptome sequencing results previously obtained in the laboratory and determined its biological function in maize. We found that <i>ZmSRG7</i> was significantly expressed in both roots and leaves under 10% PEG6000 or 150 mM NaCl. Subcellular localization showed that the gene was localized in the nucleus. The germination rate and root length of the <i>ZmSRG7</i> overexpressing lines were significantly increased under drought or salt stress compared with the control. However, after drought stress, the survival rate and relative water content of maize were increased, while the water loss rate was slowed down. Under salt stress, the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and Na<sup>+</sup>: K<sup>+</sup> ratio of maize was increased. In addition, the contents of antioxidant enzymes and proline in maize under drought or salt stress were higher than those in the control, while the contents of MDA, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> were lower than those in the control. The results showed that the <i>ZmSRG7</i> gene played its biological function by regulating the ROS signaling pathway. An interaction between ZmSRG7 and the Zmdhn1 protein was found using a yeast two-hybrid experiment. These results suggest that the <i>ZmSRG7</i> gene can improve maize tolerance to drought or salt by regulating hydrogen peroxide homeostasis.
