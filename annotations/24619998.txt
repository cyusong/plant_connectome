Plant cells have channel-like structures named plasmodesmata that allow for the symplastic molecular transport between neighbouring cells. The importance of plasmodesmata in whole plant development is well acknowledged. They mediate the cell-to-cell and vascular loading and unloading of metabolites, proteins, and other signalling molecules. However, it is still not clear how, mechanistically, these channels are regulated in response to developmental and environmental cues. This review aims to bring together knowledge acquired in recent years on plasmodesmata composition, regulation, and function. Progress in the discovery of factors that regulate symplastic transport and plant development in particular are discussed. This will hopefully highlight the challenges faced by the scientific community to unveil the mechanisms controlling symplastic communication during the formation and maintenance of plant meristems.
