As a precursor to a large variety of compounds, myo-inositol is a central molecule required for cell metabolism and plant growth. The de novo synthesis of myo-inositol requires the activity of the enzyme D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase (MIPS). MIPS cDNAs encoding one or more isoforms have been cloned from a number of species, nevertheless, little is known about the regulation of MIPS expression in developing seed. Seed-specific expression of a soybean isoform (GmMIPS-1) has been demonstrated, but tissue-specific localization during embryo development has not been reported. Using immunolocalization techniques, a specialized area of GmMIPS-1 expression was identified in the outer integumentary layer during early soybean seed development. In addition, localization data provided evidence that MIPS was associated with oxalate crystal idioblasts.
