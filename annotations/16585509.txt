['16585509', 'The Arabidopsis homolog of trithorax, ATX1, regulates numerous functions in  Arabidopsis beyond the homeotic genes. Here, we identified genome-wide targets of  ATX1 and showed that ATX1 is a receptor for a lipid messenger,  phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate, PI5P. PI5P negatively affects ATX1 activity,  suggesting a regulatory pathway connecting lipid-signaling with nuclear  functions. We propose a model to illustrate how plants may respond to stimuli  (external or internal) that elevate cellular PI5P levels by altering expression  of ATX1-controlled genes.', '2006 Apr 11', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0600944103', 'Avramova']
