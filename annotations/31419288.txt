Polyploidization is a significant source of genomic and organism diversification during plant evolution, and leads to substantial alterations in plant phenotypes and natural fitness. To help understand the phenotypic and molecular impacts of autopolyploidization, we conducted epigenetic and full-transcriptomic analyses of a synthesized autopolyploid accession of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) in order to interpret the molecular and phenotypic changes. We found that mCHH levels were decreased in both genic and transposable element (TE) regions, and that TE methylation near genes was decreased as well. Among 142 differentially expressed genes involved in cell division, cellulose biosynthesis, auxin response, growth, and reproduction processes, 75 of them were modified by 122 differentially methylated regions, 10 miRNAs, and 15 siRNAs. In addition, up-regulated PvTOE1 and suppressed PvFT probably contribute to later flowering time of the autopolyploid. The expression changes were probably associated with modification of nearby methylation sites and siRNAs. We also experimentally demonstrated that expression levels of PvFT and PvTOE1 were regulated by DNA methylation, supporting the link between alterations in methylation induced by polyploidization and the phenotypic changes that were observed. Collectively, our results show epigenetic modifications in synthetic autopolyploid switchgrass for the first time, and support the hypothesis that polyploidization-induced methylation is an important cause of phenotypic alterations and is potentially important for plant evolution and improved fitness.
