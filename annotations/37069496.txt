Casuarina equisetifolia is drought tolerant, salt tolerant, and able to grow in barren environments. It is often used to reduce wind damage, to prevent sand erosion, and to help establish plant communities in tropical and subtropical coastal zones. To determine the basis for its drought tolerance, we conducted transcriptomic and metabolic analyses of young branchlets under a non-drought treatment (D_0h) and 2-, 12-, and 24-h-long drought treatments (D_2h, D_12h, and D_24h). A total of 5033 and 8159 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in D_2h/D_0h and D_24h/D_0h. These DEGs were involved in plant hormone signal transduction, jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. A total of 148 and 168 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were identified in D_12h/D_0h and D_24h/D_0h, which were mainly amino acids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. In conclusion, C. equisetifolia responds to drought by regulating plant hormone signal transduction and the biosynthesis of JA, flavonoid, and phenylpropanoid. These results increase the understanding of drought tolerance in C. equisetifolia at both transcriptional and metabolic levels and provide new insights into coastal vegetation reconstruction and management.
