In Brassicaceae, hypersensitive-like programmed cell death (HR-like) is a central component of direct defenses triggered against eggs of the large white butterfly (Pieris brassicae). The signaling pathway leading to HR-like in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is mainly dependent on salicylic acid (SA) accumulation, but downstream components are unclear. Here, we found that treatment with P. brassicae egg extract (EE) triggered changes in expression of sphingolipid metabolism genes in Arabidopsis and black mustard (Brassica nigra). Disruption of ceramide (Cer) synthase activity led to a significant decrease of EE-induced HR-like whereas SA signaling and reactive oxygen species levels were unchanged, suggesting that Cer are downstream activators of HR-like. Sphingolipid quantifications showed that Cer with C16:0 side chains accumulated in both plant species and this response was largely unchanged in the SA-induction deficient2 (sid2-1) mutant. Finally, we provide genetic evidence that the modification of fatty acyl chains of sphingolipids modulates HR-like. Altogether, these results show that sphingolipids play a key and specific role during insect egg-triggered HR-like.

Cer with C16:0 side chains: !accumulate! in both plant species
sid2-1 mutant: !largely unchanged! in response to sphingolipids
Modification of fatty acyl chains of sphingolipids: !modulates! HR-like
