Water deficit is a major limiting condition for adaptation of maize in tropical environments. The aims of the current observations were to evaluate the kernel water relations for determining kernel developmental progress, rate, and duration of kernel filling, stem reserve mobilization in maize. In addition, canopy temperature, cell membrane stability, and anatomical adaptation under prolonged periods of pre- and post-anthesis water deficit in different hybrids was quantified to support observations related to kernel filling dynamics. In this context, two field experiments in two consecutive years were conducted with five levels of water regimes: control (D1), and four water deficit treatments [V10 to V13 (D2); V13 to V17 (D3); V17 to blister stage (D4); blisters to physiological maturity (D5)], on three maize hybrids (Pioneer 30B80, NK 40, and Suwan 4452) in Expt. 1. Expt. 2 had four water regimes: control (D1), three water deficit treatments [V10 to anthesis (D2); anthesis to milk stage (D3); milk to physiological maturity (D4)], and two maize hybrids (NK 40 and Suwan 4452). Water deficit imposed at different stages significantly reduced maximum kernel water content (MKWC), kernel filling duration (KFD), final kernel weight (FKW), and kernel weight ear<sup>-1</sup> while it increased kernel water loss rate (KWLR), kernel filling rate (KFR), and stem weight depletion (SWD) across maize hybrids in both experiments. The lowest MKWC under water deficit was at D3 in both experiments, indicating that lower KFR results in lowest FKW in maize. Findings indicate that the MKWC (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.85 and 0.41) and KFR (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.62 and 0.37) were positively related to FKW in Expt. 1 and 2, respectively. The KFD was reduced by 5, 7, 7, and 11 days under water deficit at D3, D4 in Expt. 2 and D4, D5 in Expt. 1 as compared to control, respectively. Water deficit at D5 in Expt. 1 and D4 in Expt. 2 increased KWLR, KFR, and SWD. In Expt. 2, lower canopy temperature and electrical conductivity indicated cell membrane stability across water regimes in NK 40. Hybrid NK 40 under water deficit had significantly higher cellular adaptation by increasing the number of xylem vessel while reducing vessel diameter in leaf mid-rib and attached leaf blade. These physiological adjustments improved efficient transport of water from root to the shoot, which in addition to higher kernel water content, MKWC, KFD, KFR, and stem reserve mobilization capacity, rendered NK 40 to be better adapted to water-deficit conditions under tropical environments.
