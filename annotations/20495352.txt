The in vitro tissue culture and micropropagation studies for Morus spp., a pivotal sericulture plant, are well established. The rapid and reproducible in vitro response to plant growth regulator treatments has emerged as an essential complement of transformation studies for this plant species. A major area of study is the use of protoplast culture and fusion techniques where advantages to mulberry improvement can be applied. The advancements in genetic transformation of mulberry are reviewed, and a section on strategy for transforming plastids (chloroplasts) of mulberry is included. A role for mulberry in "molecular farming" is envisioned. The conclusions and future prospects for improvement of this economically important tree species are proposed.
