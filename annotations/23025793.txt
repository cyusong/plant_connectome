['23025793', 'The central role of multisubunit tethering complexes in intracellular trafficking  has been established in yeast and mammalian systems. However, little is known  about their roles in the stress responses and the early secretory pathway in  Arabidopsis. In this study, Maigo2 (MAG2), which is equivalent to the yeast  Tip20p and mammalian Rad50-interacting protein, is found to be required for the  responses to salt stress, osmotic stress and abscisic acid in seed germination  and vegetative growth, and MAG2-like (MAG2L) is partially redundant with MAG2 in  response to environmental stresses. MAG2 strongly interacts with the central  region of ZW10, and both proteins are important as plant endoplasmic reticulum  (ER)-stress regulators. ER morphology and vacuolar protein trafficking are  unaffected in the mag2, mag2l and zw10 mutants, and the secretory marker to the  apoplast is correctly transported in mag2 plants, which indicate that MAG2  functions as a complex with ZW10, and is potentially involved in Golgi-to-ER  retrograde trafficking. Therefore, a new role for ER-Golgi membrane trafficking  in abiotic-stress and ER-stress responses is discovered.', '2013 Jun', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/j.1399-3054.2012.01704.x', 'Liu']
