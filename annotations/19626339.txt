Xylem differentiation in plants is under strict hormonal regulation. Auxins and cytokinins, together with brassinosteroids (BRs), appear to be the main hormones controlling vascular differentiation. In this report, we study the effect of these hormones on the basic peroxidase isoenzyme from Zinnia elegans (ZePrx), an enzyme involved in lignin biosynthesis. Results showed that auxins and cytokinins induce ZePrx, similarly to the way in which they induce seedling secondary growth (in particular, metaxylem differentiation). Likewise, the exogenous application of BR reduces the levels of ZePrx, in a similar way to their capacity to inhibit seedling secondary growth. Consistent with this notion, the exogenous application of BR reverses the auxin/cytokinin-induced ZePrx expression, but has no effect on the auxin/cytokinin-induced secondary growth. This differential hormonal response is supported by the analysis of the ZePrx promoter, which contains (a) cis-elements directly responsive to these hormones and (b) cis-elements targets of the plethora of transcription factors, such as NAC, MYB, AP2, MADS and class III HD Zip, which are up-regulated during the auxin- and cytokinin-induced secondary growth. Taken together, these results suggest that ZePrx is directly and indirectly regulated by the plethora of hormones that control xylem differentiation, supporting the role of ZePrx in xylem lignification.
