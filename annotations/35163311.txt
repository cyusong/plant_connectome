Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an endogenous gaseous molecule that plays an important role in the plant life cycle. The multiple transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4) was precisely regulated to participate in the abscisic acid (ABA) mediated signaling cascade. However, the molecular mechanisms of how H<sub>2</sub>S regulates ABI4 protein level to control seed germination and seedling growth have remained elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that ABI4 controls the expression of L-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE1 (DES1), a critical endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S-producing enzyme, and both ABI4 and DES1-produced H<sub>2</sub>S have inhibitory effects on seed germination. Furthermore, the ABI4 level decreased during seed germination while H<sub>2</sub>S triggered the enhancement of the persulfidation level of ABI4 and alleviated its degradation rate, which in turn inhibited seed germination and seedling establishment. Conversely, the mutation of ABI4 at Cys250 decreased ABI4 protein stability and facilitated seed germination. Moreover, ABI4 degradation is also regulated via the 26S proteasome pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest a molecular link between DES1 and ABI4 through the post-translational modifications of persulfidation during early seedling development.
