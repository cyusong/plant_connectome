Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> L.) future response to elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] has been shown to differ when inoculated with <i>B. japonicum</i> strains isolated at ambient or elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>]. Plants, inoculated with three <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> strains isolated at different [CO<sub>2</sub>], were grown in chambers at current and elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] (400 vs. 700 ppm). Together with nodule and leaf metabolomic profile, characterization of nodule N-fixation and exchange between organs were tested through <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-labeling analysis. Soybeans inoculated with SFJ14-36 strain (isolated at elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>]) showed a strong metabolic imbalance, at nodule and leaf levels when grown at ambient [CO<sub>2</sub>], probably due to an insufficient supply of N by nodules, as shown by <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-labeling. In nodules, due to shortage of photoassimilate, C may be diverted to aspartic acid instead of malate in order to improve the efficiency of the C source sustaining N<sub>2</sub>-fixation. In leaves, photorespiration and respiration were boosted at ambient [CO<sub>2</sub>] in plants inoculated with this strain. Additionally, free phytol, antioxidants, and fatty acid content could be indicate induced senescence due to oxidative stress and lack of nitrogen. Therefore, plants inoculated with <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> strain isolated at elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] may have lost their capacity to form effective symbiosis at ambient [CO<sub>2</sub>] and that was translated at whole plant level through metabolic impairment.
