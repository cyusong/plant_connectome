Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is essential for gene expression in most eukaryotic organisms. Previous studies from mammals, Drosophila, and yeast show that the majority of splicing events occurs co-transcriptionally. In plants, however, the features of co-transcriptional splicing (CTS) and its regulation still remain largely unknown. Here, we used chromatin-bound RNA sequencing to study CTS in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that CTS is widespread in Arabidopsis seedlings, with a large proportion of alternative splicing events determined co-transcriptionally. CTS efficiency correlated with gene expression level, the chromatin landscape and, most surprisingly, the number of introns and exons of individual genes, but is independent of gene length. In combination with enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis, we further showed that the hnRNP-like proteins RZ-1B and RZ-1C promote efficient CTS globally through direct binding, frequently to exonic sequences. Notably, this general effect of RZ-1B/1C on splicing promotion is mainly observed at the chromatin level, not at the mRNA level. RZ-1C promotes CTS of multiple-exon genes in association with its binding to regions both proximal and distal to the regulated introns. We propose that RZ-1C promotes efficient CTS of genes with multiple exons through cooperative interactions with many exons, introns, and splicing factors. Our work thus reveals important features of CTS in plants and provides methodologies for the investigation of CTS and RNA-binding proteins in plants.
