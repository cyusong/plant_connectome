Interactions occurring in a tritrophic system comprising plants, aphids and parasitoids are of great complexity. The generalist endoparasitoid Diaeretiella rapae (McIntosh) (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) displays specialist characteristics on brassica feeding aphids. Previously, we studied differential signalling to D. rapae by specialist and generalist Brassicaceae feeding aphids on turnip. We reported no differences in the attractiveness of volatile compounds from the two turnip/aphid complexes. However, we reported a significantly greater D. rapae attack rate on the specialist Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) than the generalist Myzus persicae (Sulzer). As a consequence we predicted that D. rapae would forage more efficiently and produce more offspring on L. erysimi. We present here some additional data collected in a more complex spatial/temporal environment in large experimental chambers and discuss this, drawing attention to the need for careful interpretation of mechanistic information in predicting the overall foraging process.
