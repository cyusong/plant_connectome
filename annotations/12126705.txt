['12126705', 'cDNA corresponding to a flavonol synthase gene from Arabidopsis thaliana was  cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was purified to  near-homogeneity and the catalytic properties of the enzyme were studied in  vitro. Together with kaempferol and apigenin the recombinant protein synthesised  the (2R,3S)-cis- and (2S,3S)-trans-isomers of dihydrokaempferol from the (2S)-  and (2R)-isomers of naringenin, respectively. Flavanones and dihydroflavanols  differing in degree of A- or B-ring hydroxylation were also accepted as  substrates.', '2002 Jul', 'Phytochemistry', '10.1016/s0031-9422(02)00155-3', 'Firmin']
