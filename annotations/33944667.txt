In the female gamete of flowering plants, sperm nuclear migration is controlled by a constant inward movement of actin filaments (F-actin) for successful fertilization. This dynamic F-actin movement is ARP2/3-independent, raising the question of how actin nucleation and polymerization is controlled in the female gamete. Using confocal microscopy live-cell imaging in combination with a pharmacological approach, we assessed the involvement of another group of actin nucleators, formins, in F-actin inward movement in the central cell of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We identify that the inhibition of the formin function, by formin inhibitor SMIFH2, significantly reduced the dynamic inward movement of F-actin in the central cell, indicating that formins play a major role in actin nucleation required for F-actin inward movement in the central cell.

ARP2/3: !controls! F-actin movement 
formins: !controls! F-actin movement 
SMIFH2: !inhibits! formin function 
formin: !nucleates! actin
