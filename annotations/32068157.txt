Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key phytohormone that mediates environmental stress responses. Vitamin C, or L-ascorbic acid (AsA), is the most abundant antioxidant protecting against stress damage in plants. How the ABA and AsA signaling pathways interact in stress responses remains elusive. In this study, we characterized the role of a previously unidentified gene, PTPN (PTP-like Nucleotidase) in plant drought tolerance. In Arabidopsis, (AtPTPN was expressed in multiple tissues and upregulated by ABA and drought treatments. Loss-of-function mutants of AtPTPN were hyposensitive to ABA but hypersensitive to drought stresses, whereas plants with enhanced expression of AtPTPN showed opposite phenotypes to . Overexpression of maize PTPN (ZmPTPN) promoted, while knockdown of ZmPTPN inhibited plant drought tolerance, indicating conserved and positive roles of PTPN in plant drought tolerance. We found that both AtPTPN and ZmPTPN release Pi by hydrolyzing GDP/GMP/dGMP/IMP/dIMP, and that AtPTPN positively regulated AsA production via endogenous Pi content control. Consistently, overexpression of VTC2, the rate-limiting synthetic enzyme in AsA biosynthesis, promoted AsA production and plant drought tolerance, and these effects were largely dependent on AtPTPN activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the heat shock transcription factor HSFA6a directly binds the AtPTPN promoter and activates AtPTPN expression. Genetic analyses showed that AtPTPN is required for HSFA6a to regulate ABA and drought responses. Taken together, our data indicate that PTPN-mediated crosstalk between the ABA signaling and AsA biosynthesis pathways positively controls plant drought tolerance.
