['18812498', 'COP1 (for CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1) and the four partially redundant SPA  (for SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA) proteins work in concert to repress photomorphogenesis  in Arabidopsis thaliana by targeting key transcription factors and phytochrome A  for degradation via the 26S proteasome. Here, we report a detailed biochemical  characterization of the SPA-COP1 complexes. The four endogenous SPA proteins can  form stable complexes with COP1 in vivo regardless of light conditions but  exhibit distinct expression profiles in different tissues and light conditions.  The SPA proteins can self-associate or interact with each other, forming a  heterogeneous group of SPA-COP1 complexes in which the exact SPA protein  compositions vary depending on the abundance of individual SPA proteins. The four  SPA proteins could be divided into two functional groups depending on their  interaction affinities, their regulation of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 degradation, and  their opposite effects on COP1 protein accumulation. Loss-of-function mutations  in a predominant SPA protein may cause a significant reduction in the overall  SPA-COP1 E3 ligase activity, resulting in a partial constitutive photomorphogenic  phenotype. This study thus provides an in-depth biochemical view of the SPA-COP1  E3 ligase complexes and offers new insights into the molecular basis for their  distinct roles in the light control of plant development.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.056580', 'Deng']
