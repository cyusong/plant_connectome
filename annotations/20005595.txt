The largest group of plant thioredoxins (TRXs) consists of the so-called h-type; their great number raises questions about their specific or redundant roles in plant cells. Pisum sativum thioredoxin h1 (PsTRXh1) and Pisum sativum thioredoxin h2 (PsTRXh2) are both h-type TRXs from pea (Pisum sativum) previously identified and biochemically characterized. While both are involved in redox regulation and show a high-sequence identity (60%), they display different behavior during in vitro and in vivo assays. In this work, we show that these two proteins display different specificity in the capturing of protein targets in vitro, by the use of a new stringent method. PsTRXh2 interacted with classical antioxidant proteins, whereas PsTRXh1 showed a completely different pattern of targeted proteins, and was able to capture a transcription factor. We also showed that the two proteins display very different thermal and chemical stabilities. We suggest that the differences in thermal and chemical stability point to a distinct and characteristic pattern of protein specificity.
