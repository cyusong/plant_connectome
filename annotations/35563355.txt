Root and tuber crops are of great importance. They not only contribute to feeding the population but also provide raw material for medicine and small-scale industries. The yield of the root and tuber crops is subject to the development of stem/root tubers, which involves the initiation, expansion, and maturation of storage organs. The formation of the storage organ is a highly intricate process, regulated by multiple phytohormones. Gibberellins (GAs) and abscisic acid (ABA), as antagonists, are essential regulators during stem/root tuber development. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the roles of GA and ABA during stem/root tuber development in various tuber crops.

GA: !regulates! stem/root tuber development
ABA: !regulates! stem/root tuber development
GAs: !antagonize! ABA
stem/root tuber development: !contributes to! yield of root and tuber crops
stem/root tuber development: !involves! initiation, expansion, and maturation of storage organs
