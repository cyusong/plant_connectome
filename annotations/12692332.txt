['12692332', 'Characterization of components 17 and 23 of the inner mitochondrial membrane  translocase (TIM17:23) from Arabidopsis indicated that there were three genes  present for TIM17 and TIM23 and two for TIM44. AtTIM17 differed from the yeast  (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammalian homologs in that two genes encoded  proteins that were longer and one gene encoded a shorter protein. All Arabidopsis  TIM23 predicted proteins appeared to lack the first 34 amino acids compared with  yeast TIM23. All AtTIM17 and AtTIM23 genes were expressed but displayed different  tissue and developmental profiles. Complementation of deletion mutants in yeast  indicated that for AtTIM17, the extension at the C terminus not present in yeast  had to be removed to achieve complementation, whereas for TIM23, a preprotein and  amino acid transporter domain had to be present for complementation. Import  assays with AtTIM17 and AtTIM23 indicated that they both contained internal  signals for integration into the inner mitochondrial membrane in a membrane  potential-dependent manner. The C terminus of imported AtTIM17-2 was susceptible  to degradation by externally added protease with intact mitochondria. Removal of  the 85 C-terminal amino acids resulted in import and full protection of the  truncated protein. This suggests that the novel extension at the C terminus of  AtTIM17-2 links the outer and inner membrane in a manner analogous to yeast  TIM23.', '2003 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.102.016808', 'Whelan']
