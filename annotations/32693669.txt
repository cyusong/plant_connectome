As the main active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicine <i>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</i> Fisch, liquiritin has multiple biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antihepatotoxicity, immune regulation, anti-virus and anti-cancer. In addition, liquiritin has been recognized as an allelochemical that displays markedly inhibitory effects on the growth of target plants, <i>G. uralensis</i> and lettuce. However, its phytotoxic mechanism remains unknown. In the present study, the mode of action of liquiritin against root growth of lettuce seedling was researched. After treatments with liquiritin, the cell division in root tips of lettuce seedlings was partly arrested, and the cell viability and root vitality were obviously lost. At the same time, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline (Pro) in lettuce seedlings were induced by liquiritin. The results indicated that the phytotoxic effects of liquiritin was probably dependent on the induction of ROS overproduction, resulting in membrane lipids peroxidation following with cell death and mitosis process disorder.
