The present review summarizes recent advances in the understanding of 6mA in DNA as an emergent epigenetic mark with distinctive characteristics, discusses its importance in plant genomes, and highlights its chemical nature and functions. Adenine methylation is an epigenetic modification present in DNA (6mA) and RNA (m6A) that has a regulatory function in many cellular processes. This modification occurs through a reversible reaction that covalently binds a methyl group, usually at the N<sup>6</sup> position of the purine ring. This modification carries biophysical properties that affect the stability of nucleic acids as well as their binding affinity with other molecules. DNA 6mA has been related to genome stability, gene expression, DNA replication, and repair mechanisms. Recent advances have shown that 6mA in plant genomes is related to development and stress response. In this review, we present recent advances in the understanding of 6mA in DNA as an emergent epigenetic mark with distinctive characteristics. We discuss the key elements of this modification, focusing mainly on its importance in plant genomes. Furthermore, we highlight its chemical nature and the regulatory effects that it exerts on gene expression and plant development. Finally, we emphasize the functions of 6mA in photosynthesis, stress, and flowering.
