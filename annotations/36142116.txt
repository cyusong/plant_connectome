CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing technologies, which allow the precise manipulation of plant genomes, have revolutionized plant science and enabled the creation of germplasms with beneficial traits. In order to apply these technologies, CRISPR/Cas reagents must be delivered into plant cells; however, this is limited by tissue culture challenges. Recently, viral vectors have been used to deliver CRISPR/Cas reagents into plant cells. Virus-induced genome editing (VIGE) has emerged as a powerful method with several advantages, including high editing efficiency and a simplified process for generating gene-edited DNA-free plants. Here, we briefly describe CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing. We then focus on VIGE systems and the types of viruses used currently for CRISPR/Cas9 cassette delivery and genome editing. We also highlight recent applications of and advances in VIGE in plants. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential for VIGE in plants.
