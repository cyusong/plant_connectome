Here, for the first time, a comprehensive transcriptomics study is presented of leaf senescence in the legume model Medicago truncatula, providing a broad overview of differentially expressed transcripts involved in this process. The cDNA-amplification fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was used to identify > 500 genes, which were cloned and sorted into functional categories according to their gene ontology annotation. Comparison between the datasets of Arabidopsis and M. truncatula leaf senescence reveals common physiological events but differences in the nitrogen metabolism and in transcriptional regulation. In addition, it was observed that a minority of the genes regulated during leaf senescence were equally involved in other processes leading to programmed cell death, such as nodule senescence and nitric oxide signalling. This study provides a wide transcriptional profile for the comprehension of key events of leaf senescence in M. truncatula and highlights a possible regulative role for MADS box transcription factors in the terminal phases of the process.
