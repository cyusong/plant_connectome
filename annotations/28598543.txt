Plant species exhibit substantial variation in leaf morphology. We isolated a recessive mutant gene termed small and cordate leaf 1 (scl1) that causes alteration in both leaf size and shape of cucumber. Compared to wild type leaves, the scl1 mutant had fewer numbers of epidermal pavement cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with this leaf phenotype, which occurred in a putative nucleoside bisphosphate phosphatase. RNA-seq analysis of the wild type and scl1 mutant leaves suggested that SCL1 regulation may not involve known hormonal pathways. Our work identified a candidate gene for SCL1 that may play a role in leaf development.
