['19759341', 'All plants produce suberin, a lipophilic barrier of the cell wall that controls  water and solute fluxes and restricts pathogen infection. It is often described  as a heteropolymer comprised of polyaliphatic and polyaromatic domains. Major  monomers include omega-hydroxy and alpha,omega-dicarboxylic fatty acids,  glycerol, and ferulate. No genes have yet been identified for the aromatic  suberin pathway. Here we demonstrate that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene  AT5G41040, a member of the BAHD family of acyltransferases, is essential for  incorporation of ferulate into suberin. In Arabidopsis plants transformed with  the AT5G41040 promoter:YFP fusion, reporter expression is localized to cell  layers undergoing suberization. Knockout mutants of AT5G41040 show almost  complete elimination of suberin-associated ester-linked ferulate. However, the  classic lamellar structure of suberin in root periderm of at5g41040 is not  disrupted. The reduction in ferulate in at5g41040-knockout seeds is associated  with an approximate stoichiometric decrease in aliphatic monomers containing  omega-hydroxyl groups. Recombinant AT5G41040p catalyzed acyl transfer from  feruloyl-coenzyme A to omega-hydroxyfatty acids and fatty alcohols, demonstrating  that the gene encodes a feruloyl transferase. CYP86B1, a cytochrome P450  monooxygenase gene whose transcript levels correlate with AT5G41040 expression,  was also investigated. Knockouts and overexpression confirmed CYP86B1 as an  oxidase required for the biosynthesis of very-long-chain saturated  alpha,omega-bifunctional aliphatic monomers in suberin. The seed suberin  composition of cyp86b1 knockout was surprisingly dominated by unsubstituted fatty  acids that are incapable of polymeric linkages. Together, these results challenge  our current view of suberin structure by questioning both the function of  ester-linked ferulate as an essential component and the existence of an extended  aliphatic polyester.', '2009 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.144907', 'Pollard']
