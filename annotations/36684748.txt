Injuries sustained by sugarbeet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i> L.) roots during harvest and postharvest operations seriously reduce the yield of white sugar produced from stored roots. Although wound healing is critically important to reduce losses, knowledge of these processes is limited for this crop as well as for roots in other species. To better understand the metabolic signals and changes that occur in wounded roots, dynamic changes in gene expression were determined by RNA sequencing and the activity of products from key genes identified in this analysis were determined in the 0.25 to 24 h following injury. Nearly five thousand differentially expressed genes that contribute to a wide range of cellular and molecular functions were identified in wounded roots. Highly upregulated genes included transcription factor genes, as well as genes involved in ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signaling and phenolic compound biosynthesis and polymerization. Enzyme activities for key genes in ethylene and phenolic compound biosynthesis and polymerization also increased due to wounding. Results indicate that wounding causes a major reallocation of metabolism in sugarbeet taproots. Although both ethylene and JA are likely involved in triggering wound responses, the greater and more sustained upregulation of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling genes relative to those of JA, suggest a preeminence of ethylene signaling in wounded sugarbeet roots. Changes in gene expression and enzymes involved in phenolic compound metabolism additionally indicate that barriers synthesized to seal off wounds, such as suberin or lignin, are initiated within the first 24 h after injury.
