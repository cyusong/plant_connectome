['35150931', 'Clustered organization of biosynthetic non-homologous genes is emerging as a  characteristic feature of plant genomes. The co-regulation of clustered genes  seems to largely depend on epigenetic reprogramming and three-dimensional  chromatin conformation. In this study, we identified the long non-coding RNA  (lncRNA) MARneral Silencing (MARS), localized inside the Arabidopsis marneral  cluster, which controls the local epigenetic activation of its surrounding region  in response to abscisic acid (ABA). MARS modulates the POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE  COMPLEX 1 (PRC1) component LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1) binding  throughout the cluster in a dose-dependent manner, determining H3K27me3  deposition and chromatin condensation. In response to ABA, MARS decoys LHP1 away  from the cluster and promotes the formation of a chromatin loop bringing together  the MARNERAL SYNTHASE 1 (MRN1) locus and a distal ABA-responsive enhancer. The  enrichment of co-regulated lncRNAs in clustered metabolic genes in Arabidopsis  suggests that the acquisition of novel non-coding transcriptional units may  constitute an additional regulatory layer driving the evolution of biosynthetic  pathways.', '2022 May 2', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2022.02.007', 'Blein']
