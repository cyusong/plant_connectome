Three papers, two in a recent issue of Nature and one in the July issue of Developmental Cell, identify a family of F box proteins as the long-sought receptors for the plant growth hormone auxin. The new studies reveal that auxin, a small molecule, regulates F box proteins, which are involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. This finding has profound implications for understanding plant physiology and development and for defining new modes of regulation of SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes.
