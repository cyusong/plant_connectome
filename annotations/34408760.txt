In flowering plants, mitochondrial genes contain approximately 20-26 introns. Splicing of these introns is essential for mitochondrial gene expression and function. Recent studies have revealed that both nucleus- and mitochondrion-encoded factors are required for intron splicing, but the mechanism of splicing remains largely unknown. Elucidation of the mechanism necessitates a complete understanding of the splicing factors. Here, we report the identification of a regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1)-domain protein DEK47 that is required for mitochondrial intron splicing and seed development in maize. Loss of function in <i>Dek47</i> severely arrests embryo and endosperm development, resulting in a <i>defective kernel (dek)</i> phenotype. DEK47 harbors seven RCC1 domains and is targeted to mitochondria. Null mutation of DEK47 causes a deficiency in the splicing of all four <i>nad2</i> introns, abolishing the production of mature <i>nad2</i> transcript and resulting in the disassembly and severely reduced activity of mitochondrial complex I. In response, the expression of the alternative oxidase <i>AOX2</i> is sharply increased in <i>dek47</i>. These results indicate that <i>Dek47</i> is required for the splicing of all the <i>nad2</i> introns in mitochondria, and essential for complex I assembly, and kernel development in maize.
