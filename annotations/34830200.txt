GDSL-type esterase/lipase proteins (GELPs) characterized by a conserved GDSL motif at their N-terminus belong to the lipid hydrolysis enzyme superfamily. In plants, GELPs play an important role in plant growth, development and stress response. The studies of the identification and characterization of the <i>GELP</i> gene family in Triticeae have not been reported. In this study, 193 <i>DvGELPs</i> were identified in <i>Dasypyrum villosum</i> and classified into 11 groups (clade A-K) by means of phylogenetic analysis. Most <i>DvGELPs</i> contain only one GDSL domain, only four <i>DvGELPs</i> contain other domains besides the GDSL domain. Gene structure analysis indicated 35.2% <i>DvGELP</i> genes have four introns and five exons. In the promoter regions of the identified <i>DvGELP</i><i>s</i>, we detected 4502 putative <i>cis</i>-elements, which were associated with plant hormones, plant growth, environmental stress and light responsiveness. Expression profiling revealed 36, 44 and 17 <i>DvGELPs</i> were highly expressed in the spike, the root and the grain, respectively. Further investigation of a root-specific expressing <i>GELP</i>, <i>DvGELP53</i>, indicated it was induced by a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. The knockdown of <i>DvGELP53</i> inhibited long-distance movement of BSMV in the tissue of <i>D. villosum</i>. This research provides a genome-wide glimpse of the <i>D. villosum GELP</i> genes and hints at the participation of <i>DvGELP53</i> in the interaction between virus and plants.
