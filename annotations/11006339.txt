['11006339', 'The salt tolerance gene SOS3 (for salt overly sensitive3) of Arabidopsis is  predicted to encode a calcium binding protein with an N-myristoylation signature  sequence. Here, we examine the myristoylation and calcium binding properties of  SOS3 and their functional significance in plant tolerance to salt. Treatment of  young Arabidopsis seedlings with the myristoylation inhibitor 2-hydroxymyristic  acid caused the swelling of root tips, mimicking the phenotype of the  salt-hypersensitive mutant sos3-1. In vitro translation assays with reticulocyte  showed that the SOS3 protein was myristoylated. Targeted mutagenesis of the  N-terminal glycine-2 to alanine prevented the myristoylation of SOS3. The  functional significance of SOS3 myristoylation was examined by expressing the  wild-type myristoylated SOS3 and the mutated nonmyristoylated SOS3 in the sos3-1  mutant. Expression of the myristoylated but not the nonmyristoylated SOS3  complemented the salt-hypersensitive phenotype of sos3-1 plants. No significant  difference in membrane association was observed between the myristoylated and  nonmyristoylated SOS3. Gel mobility shift and (45)Ca(2)+ overlay assays  demonstrated that SOS3 is a unique calcium binding protein and that the sos3-1  mutation substantially reduced the capacity of SOS3 to bind calcium. The  resulting mutant SOS3 protein was not able to interact with the SOS2 protein  kinase and was less capable of activating it. Together, these results strongly  suggest that both N-myristoylation and calcium binding are required for SOS3  function in plant salt tolerance.', '2000 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.9.1667', 'Zhu']
