['35080330', 'Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, complex II), which plays an essential role in  mitochondrial respiration and tricarboxylic acid metabolism, requires the  assembly of eight nuclear-encoded subunits and the insertion of various  cofactors. Here, we report on the characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana  leucine-tyrosine-arginine (LYR) protein family member SDHAF1, (At2g39725) is a  factor required for SDH activity. SDHAF1 is located in mitochondria and can fully  complement the yeast SDHAF1 deletion strain. Knockdown of SDHAF1 using RNA  interference resulted in a decrease in seedling hypocotyl elongation and reduced  SDH activity. Proteomic analyses revealed a decreased abundance of various SDH  subunits and assembly factors. Protein interaction assays revealed that SDHAF1  can interact exclusively with the Fe-S cluster-containing subunit SDH2 and HSCB,  a cochaperone involved in Fe-S cluster complex recruitment. Therefore, we propose  that in Arabidopsis, SDHAF1 plays a role in the biogenesis of SDH2 to form the  functional complex II, which is essential for mitochondrial respiration and  metabolism.', '2022 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.15684', 'ORCID:']
