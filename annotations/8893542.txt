['8893542', 'Novel Arabidopsis mutants with lowered levels of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA)  were isolated. These were selected in a screen for germination in the presence of  the gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol. Another mutant was isolated  in a screen for NaCl tolerance. The ABA-deficiency was caused by two monogenic,  recessive mutations, aba2 and aba3, that were both located on chromosome 1. The  mutants showed a phenotype that is known to be characteristic for ABA-deficiency:  a reduced seed dormancy and excessive water loss, leading to a wilty phenotype.  Double mutant analysis, combining different aba mutations, indicated the leaky  nature of the mutations.', '1996 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1996.10040655.x', 'Koornneef']
