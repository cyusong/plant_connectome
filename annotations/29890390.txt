Previous results have shown that hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), mainly catalyzed by l-cysteine desulfhydrase (DES) in plants, triggers adventitious rooting. The objective of this study was to test whether H<sub>2</sub>S is involved in methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)-induced adventitious root development in cucumber explants. First, we observed that the activities of DES, endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S production, and thereafter adventitious root development were induced by CH<sub>4</sub> and NaHS (an H<sub>2</sub>S donor). Some responses were sensitive to hypotaurine (HT; a scavenger of H<sub>2</sub>S), showing that endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S production and adventitious rooting were obviously blocked. The development of adventitious root primordia was also impaired. Further molecular evidence revealed that CH<sub>4</sub>-induced gene expression of CsDNAJ-1, CsCDPK1, CsCDPK5, CsCDC6 (a cell-division-related gene), CsAux22D-like, and CsAux22B-like (two auxin-signaling genes), several molecular markers responsible for adventitious rooting, were blocked by the co-treatment with HT. The occurrence of CH<sub>4</sub>-elicited S-sulfhydration during the above responses was also sensitive to the removal of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S, suggesting the requirement of H<sub>2</sub>S. Taken together, our results reveal a vital role of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S in CH<sub>4</sub>-triggered cucumber adventitious root development, and thus provide a comprehensive window into the complex signaling transduction pathway in CH<sub>4</sub>-mediated root organogenesis.
