Plant osmoprotectants protect against abiotic stresses. Introgression of osmoprotectant genes into crop plants via genetic engineering is an important strategy in developing more productive plants. Plants employ adaptive mechanisms to survive various abiotic stresses. One mechanism, the osmoprotection system, utilizes various groups of low molecular weight compounds, collectively known as osmoprotectants, to mitigate the negative effect of abiotic stresses. Osmoprotectants may include amino acids, polyamines, quaternary ammonium compounds and sugars. These nontoxic compounds stabilize cellular structures and enzymes, act as metabolic signals, and scavenge reactive oxygen species produced under stressful conditions. The advent of recent drastic fluctuations in the global climate necessitates the development of plants better adapted to abiotic stresses. The introgression of genes related to osmoprotectant biosynthesis from one plant to another by genetic engineering is a unique strategy bypassing laborious conventional and classical breeding programs. Herein, we review recent literature related to osmoprotectants and transgenic plants engineered with specific osmoprotectant properties.
