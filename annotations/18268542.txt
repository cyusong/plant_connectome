['18268542', 'Iron is an essential element for plant growth and development. Iron homeostasis  in plants is tightly regulated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional  level. Several bHLH transcription factors involved in iron homeostasis have been  identified recently. However, their regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. In this  work, we demonstrate that the transcription factor FIT interacted with AtbHLH38  and AtbHLH39 and directly conferred the expression regulation of iron uptake  genes for iron homeostasis in Arabidopsis. Yeast two-hybrid analysis and  transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that AtbHLH38 or AtbHLH39  interacted with FIT, a central transcription factor involved in iron homeostasis  in Arabidopsis. Expression of FIT/AtbHLH38 or FIT/AtbHLH39 in yeast cells  activated GUS expression driven by ferric chelate reductase (FRO2) and ferrous  transporter (IRT1) promoters. Overexpression of FIT with either AtbHLH38 or  AtbHLH39 in plants converted the expression of the iron uptake genes FRO2 and  IRT1 from induced to constitutive. Further analysis revealed that FRO2 and IRT1  were not regulated at the posttranscriptional level in these plants because IRT1  protein accumulation and high ferric chelate reductase activity were detected in  the overexpression plants under both iron deficiency and iron sufficiency. The  double overexpression plants accumulated more iron in their shoots than wild type  or the plants overexpressing either AtbHLH38, AtbHLH39 or FIT. Our data support  that ferric-chelate reductase FRO2 and ferrous-transporter IRT1 are the targets  of the three transcription factors and the transcription of FRO2 and IRT1 is  directly regulated by a complex of FIT/AtbHLH38 or FIT/AtbHLH39.', '2008 Mar', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2008.26', 'Ling']
