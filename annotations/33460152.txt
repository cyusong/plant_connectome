Pollination syndromes, recurring suites of floral traits appearing in connection with specific functional pollinator groups, have served for decades to organise floral diversity under a functional-ecological perspective. Some potential caveats, such as over-simplification of complex plant-animal interactions or lack of empirical observations, have been identified and discussed in recent years. Which of these caveats do indeed cause problems, which have been solved and where do future possibilities lie? I address these questions in a review of the pollination-syndrome literature of 2010 to 2019. I show that the majority of studies was based on detailed empirical pollinator observations and could reliably predict pollinators based on a few floral traits such as colour, shape or reward. Some traits (i.e. colour) were less reliable in predicting pollinators than others (i.e. reward, corolla width), however. I stress that future studies should consider floral traits beyond those traditionally recorded to expand our understanding of mechanisms of floral evolution. I discuss statistical methods suitable for objectively analysing the interplay of system-specific evolutionary constraints, pollinator-mediated selection and adaptive trade-offs at microecological and macroecological scales. I exemplify my arguments on an empirical dataset of floral traits of a neotropical plant radiation in the family Melastomataceae.

Pollination syndromes: !predict! Pollinators 
Floral traits: !reliably predict! Pollinators 
Colour: !less reliable than! Reward/Corolla width 
Future studies: !consider! Floral traits beyond traditionally recorded 
Statistical methods: !analyse! Interplay of evolutionary constraints/selection/trade-offs 
Empirical dataset: !exemplify! Arguments on neotropical plant radiation
