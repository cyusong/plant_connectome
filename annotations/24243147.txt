['24243147', 'Mannans are hemicellulosic polysaccharides that have a structural role and serve  as storage reserves during plant growth and development. Previous studies led to  the conclusion that mannan synthase enzymes in several plant species are encoded  by members of the cellulose synthase-like A (CSLA) gene family. Arabidopsis has  nine members of the CSLA gene family. Earlier work has shown that CSLA9 is  responsible for the majority of glucomannan synthesis in both primary and  secondary cell walls of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems. Little is known about  how expression of the CLSA9 gene is regulated. Sequence analysis of the CSLA9  promoter region revealed the presence of multiple copies of a cis-regulatory  motif (M46RE) recognized by transcription factor MYB46, leading to the hypothesis  that MYB46 (At5g12870) is a direct regulator of the mannan synthase CLSA9. We  obtained several lines of experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis.  First, the expression of CSLA9 was substantially upregulated by MYB46  overexpression. Second, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to  demonstrate the direct binding of MYB46 to the promoter of CSLA9 in vitro. This  interaction was further confirmed in vivo by a chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay. Finally, over-expression of MYB46 resulted in a significant increase in  mannan content. Considering the multifaceted nature of MYB46-mediated  transcriptional regulation of secondary wall biosynthesis, we reasoned that  additional transcription factors are involved in the CSLA9 regulation. This  hypothesis was tested by carrying out yeast-one hybrid screening, which  identified ANAC041 and bZIP1 as direct regulators of CSLA9. Transcriptional  activation assays and EMSA were used to confirm the yeast-one hybrid results.  Taken together, we report that transcription factors ANAC041, bZIP1 and MYB46  directly regulate the expression of CSLA9.', '2014 Mar', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-013-0154-9', 'Han']
