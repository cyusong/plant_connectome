The insertion of microelectrodes into plants to record electric potentials can generate electric potential responses due to disturbance of plant tissues. Here, the electric potential triggered by Ag/AgCl glass microelectrode insertion into the stele of <i>Myriophyllum aquaticum</i> (parrot feather) plants was recorded. A system potential was triggered upon the electrode insertion and was propagated along the stele of the stem. The microelectrode detected this electric potential that was triggered by its own insertion and the electric potential was identical among the plants assessed. The temporal variation in electric potential registered two prominent peaks at 31.9 ± 1.8 and 17.1 ± 4.3 mV. The electric potential was repolarized after approximately 50-70 min and the stabilized electric potential was 6.5 ± 2.5 mV higher than the initial electric potential of plants. Control experiments conducted using a non-biological spongy rod wetted with distilled water or 1 M KCl confirmed that the peaks were solely due to the electric potential in the stem. These signals can be recognized as system potentials. The systematic EP could develop stimuli responses in distant locations, which is to be tested in further studies.
