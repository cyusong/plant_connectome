The <i>NPR1</i> gene encodes a key component of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) signaling mediated by salicylic acid (SA). Overexpression of <i>NPR1</i> confers resistance to biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi in several plant species. The <i>NPR1</i> gene has also been shown to be involved in the crosstalk between SAR signaling and the jasmonic acid-ethylene (JA/Et) pathway, which is involved in the response to necrotrophic fungi. The aim of this research was to generate transgenic olive plants expressing the <i>NPR1</i> gene from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to evaluate their differential response to the hemibiotrophic fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> and the necrotroph <i>Rosellinia necatrix</i>. Three transgenic lines expressing the <i>AtNPR1</i> gene under the control of the constitutive promoter CaMV35S were obtained using an embryogenic line derived from a seed of cv. Picual. After maturation and germination of the transgenic somatic embryos, the plants were micropropagated and acclimated to <i>ex vitro</i> conditions. The level of <i>AtNPR1</i> expression in the transgenic materials varied greatly among the different lines and was higher in the <i>NPR1</i>-780 line. The expression of <i>AtNPR1</i> did not alter the growth of transgenic plants either <i>in vitro</i> or in the greenhouse. Different levels of transgene expression also did not affect basal endochitinase activity in the leaves, which was similar to that of control plants. Response to the hemibiotrophic pathogen <i>V. dahliae</i> varied with pathotype. All plants died by 50 days after inoculation with defoliating (D) pathotype V-138, but the response to non-defoliating (ND) strains differed by race: following inoculation with the V-1242 strain (ND, race 2), symptoms appeared after 44-55 days, with line <i>NPR1</i>-780 showing the lowest disease severity index. This line also showed good performance when inoculated with the V-1558 strain (ND, race 1), although the differences from the control were not statistically significant. In response to the necrotroph <i>R. necatrix</i>, all the transgenic lines showed a slight delay in disease development, with mean area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) values 7-15% lower than that of the control.
