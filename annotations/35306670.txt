Traits enabling seeds to survive post-dispersal desiccation and subsequently germinate are important aspects of plant regeneration for species with desiccation-sensitive seeds. However, how desiccation and germination-related traits co-vary and relate to patterns of climate variation are unknown. We investigated physiological traits related to desiccation and germination of desiccation-sensitive seeds from 19 Quercus species, which typically dominate subalpine, subtropical and temperate forests in China. The results demonstrate a strong relationship between climate and seed traits consistent with a hypothesis of minimizing seed death from desiccation. Seeds of subalpine species were most desiccation sensitive and died fastest when dried. These species avoided drought and cold by germinating rapidly. Subtropical and temperate oaks had more variable strategies to minimize the risk of mortality reflecting a continuum between traits that facilitate rapid germination (with the risk of rapid desiccation) and slow germination (and slow desiccation). Across the Quercus species, the relative level of seed desiccation sensitivity, which we predicted to be important for reducing the risk of drying related mortality, was independent of climate. For desiccation-sensitive seeds this suggests a more diverse range of strategies for minimizing desiccation risk than reported previously.
