Pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI) inhibits pectin methylesterase (PME) activity at post-translation level, which plays core roles in vegetative and reproductive processes and various stress responses of plants. However, the roles of PMEIs in tea plant are still undiscovered. Herein, a total of 51 <i>CsPMEIs</i> genes were identified from tea plant genome. <i>CsPMEI1</i>-<i>4</i> transcripts were varied in different tea plant tissues and regulated by various treatments, including biotic and abiotic stresses, sugar treatments, cold acclimation and bud dormancy. Overexpression of <i>CsPMEI4</i> slightly decreased cold tolerance of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> associated with lower electrolyte leakage, soluble sugars contents and transcripts of many cold-induced genes as compared to wild type plants. Under long-day and short-day conditions, <i>CsPMEI2</i>/<i>4</i> promoted early flowering phenotypes in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> along with higher expression levels of many flowering-related genes. Moreover, overexpression of <i>CsPMEI2</i>/<i>4</i> decreased PME activity, but increased sugars contents (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> as compared with wild type plants under short-day condition. These results indicate that <i>CsPMEIs</i> are widely involved in tea plant vegetative and reproductive processes, and also in various stress responses. Moreover, <i>CsPMEI4</i> negatively regulated cold response, meanwhile, <i>CsPMEI2</i>/<i>4</i> promoted early flowering of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> via the autonomous pathway. Collectively, these results open new perspectives on the roles of PMEIs in tea plant.
