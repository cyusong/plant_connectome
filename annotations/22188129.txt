['22188129', "Interactions with the (a)biotic environment play key roles in a plant's fitness  and vitality. In addition to direct surface-to-surface contact, volatile  chemicals can also affect the physiology of organism. Volatiles of Serratia  plymuthica and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia significantly inhibited growth and  induced H(2) O(2) production in Arabidopsis in dual culture. Within 1 day,  transcriptional changes were observed by promoter-GUS assays using a  stress-inducible W-box-containing 4xGST1 construct. Expression studies performed  at 6, 12 and 24 h revealed altered transcript levels for 889 genes and 655 genes  in response to Se. plymuthica or St. maltophilia volatiles, respectively.  Expression of 162 genes was altered in both treatments. Meta-analysis revealed  that specifically volatile-responsive genes were significantly overlapping with  those affected by abiotic stress. We use the term mVAMP (microbial  volatile-associated molecular pattern) to describe these volatile-specific  responses. Genes responsive to both treatments were enriched for W-box motifs in  their promoters, and were significantly enriched for transcription factors (ERF2,  ZAT10, MYB73 and WRKY18). The susceptibility of wrky18 mutant lines to volatiles  was significantly delayed, suggesting an indispensable role for WRKY18 in  bacterial volatile responses.", '2012 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04891.x', 'Piechulla']
