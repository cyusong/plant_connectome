The chloroplast is an organelle of prokaryotic origin that is situated in an eukaryotic cellular environment. As a result of this formerly endosymbiotic situation, the chloroplast houses a unique set of protein transport machineries. Among those are evolutionarily young transport pathways which are responsible for the import of the nuclear-encoded proteins into the organelle as well as ancient pathways operating in the 'export' of proteins from the stroma (the former cyanobacterial cytosol) across the thylakoid membrane into the thylakoid lumen. In this review, we have tried to address the main features of these various transport pathways.
