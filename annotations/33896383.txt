Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases play a critical role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the covalent attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. However, the role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in plants remains poorly understood. In this study, a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) glycyl-tRNA synthetase 3, OsGlyRS3, was found to impact heading date in rice. Flowering in <i>osglyrs3</i>, a mutant line containing a T-DNA insertion in <i>OsGlyRS3</i>, was advanced by approximately 2 weeks compared to wild type. Expression analysis of flowering regulator genes showed that transcript levels of <i>Heading date 1</i> (<i>Hd1), Heading date 3a</i> (<i>Hd3a</i>), and <i>OsMADS51</i> were elevated in <i>osglyrs3</i>. These data indicate that the loss of OsGlyRS3 activity induces the expression of flowering-activating genes, resulting in early flowering.
