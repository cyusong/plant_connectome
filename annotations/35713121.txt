<i>Aconitum carmichaelii</i> Debx. is used as traditional herbal medicine in China, Japan, and other Asian countries. <i>A. carmichaelii</i> has two modes for reproduction: sexual reproduction with seed and vegetative reproduction with vegetative propagules. The vegetative propagules are belowground and invisible. To date, only a handful of studies for the clonal growth are available. In this study, we investigated the clonal growth by anatomical and morphological changes. Results revealed that the axillary bud appeared on the rhizome. Furthermore, the axillary meristem in the axillary bud differentiated a bud upwards and an adventitious root (AR) downwards. The AR expanded to a tuberous root in order to provide the bud nutrients for the new plant. The AR branched LRs. In addition, some lateral roots (LRs) on the AR also swelled. Both the AR and LR were found to follow a similar pattern of development. However, high lignification in the stele region of LRs inhibited further expansion. AR development was attributed to activities of the cambium and meristem cell, starch accumulation, stele lignification, and a polyarch stele. Our study not only provides a better understanding of clonal growth but also provides clues to explore the regulatory mechanisms underlying AR development in <i>A. carmichaelii.</i>
