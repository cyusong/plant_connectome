['12609033', 'Cytochromes P450 of the CYP79 family catalyze the conversion of amino acids to  oximes in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates, a group of natural plant products  known to be involved in plant defense and as a source of flavor compounds,  cancer-preventing agents and bioherbicides. We report a detailed biochemical  analysis of the substrate specificity and kinetics of CYP79F1 and CYP79F2, two  cytochromes P450 involved in the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates in  Arabidopsis thaliana. Using recombinant CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 expressed in  Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively, we show that CYP79F1  metabolizes mono- to hexahomomethionine, resulting in both short- and long-chain  aliphatic glucosinolates. In contrast, CYP79F2 exclusively metabolizes long-chain  elongated penta- and hexahomomethionines. CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 are spatially and  developmentally regulated, with different gene expression patterns. CYP79F2 is  highly expressed in hypocotyl and roots, whereas CYP79F1 is strongly expressed in  cotyledons, rosette leaves, stems, and siliques. A transposon-tagged CYP79F1  knockout mutant completely lacks short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates, but has an  increased level of long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates, especially in leaves and  seeds. The level of long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates in a transposon-tagged  CYP79F2 knockout mutant is substantially reduced, whereas the level of  short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates is not affected. Biochemical  characterization of CYP79F1 and CYP79F2, and gene expression analysis, combined  with glucosinolate profiling of knockout mutants demonstrate the functional role  of these enzymes. This provides valuable insights into the metabolic network  leading to the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates, and into metabolic  engineering of altered aliphatic glucosinolate profiles to improve nutritional  value and pest resistance.', '2003 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01679.x', 'Halkier']
