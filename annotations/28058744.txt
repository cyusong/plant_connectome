The Arabidopsis UV-B photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) orchestrates the expression of hundreds of genes, many of which can be associated with UV-B tolerance. UV-B does not efficiently penetrate into tissues, yet UV-B regulates complex growth and developmental responses. To unravel to what extent and how UVR8 located in different tissues contributes to UV-B-induced responses, we expressed UVR8 fused to the YELLOW FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (YFP) under the control of tissue-specific promoters in a uvr8 null mutant background. We show that (1) UVR8 localized in the epidermis plays a major role in regulating cotyledon expansion, and (2) expression of UVR8 in the mesophyll is important to protect adult plants from the damaging effects of UV-B. We found that UV-B induces transcription of selected genes, including the key transcriptional regulator ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), only in tissues that express UVR8. Thus, we suggest that tissue-autonomous and simultaneous UVR8 signalling in different tissues mediates, at least partly, developmental and defence responses to UV-B.
