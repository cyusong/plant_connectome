Plant immunity largely relies on intracellular nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors. Some plant NLRs carry integrated domains (IDs) that mimic authentic pathogen effector targets. We report here the identification of a genetically linked NLR-ID/NLR pair: BnRPR1 and BnRPR2 in Brassica napus. The NLR-ID carries two ID fusions and the mode of action of the pair conforms to the proposed "integrated sensor/decoy" model. The two NLRs interact and the heterocomplex localizes in the plant-cell nucleus and nucleolus. However, the BnRPRs pair does not operate through a negative regulation as it was previously reported for other NLR-IDs. Cell death is induced only upon co-expression of the two proteins and is dependent on the helper genes, EDS1 and NRG1. The nuclear localization of both proteins seems to be essential for cell death activation, while the IDs of BnRPR1 are dispensable for this purpose. In summary, we describe a new pair of NLR-IDs with interesting features in relation to its regulation and the cell death activation.
