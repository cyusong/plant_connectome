['31203894', 'C2H2-type zinc finger proteins play important roles in plant growth, development,  and abiotic stress tolerance. Here, we explored the role of the C2H2-type zinc  finger protein SALT INDUCED ZINC FINGER PROTEIN1 (AtSIZ1; At3G25910) in  Arabidopsis thaliana under salt stress. AtSIZ1 expression was induced by salt  treatment. During the germination stage, the germination rate, germination  energy, germination index, cotyledon growth rate, and root length were  significantly higher in AtSIZ1 overexpression lines than in the wild type under  various stress treatments, whereas these indices were significantly reduced in  AtSIZ1 loss-of-function mutants. At the mature seedling stage, the overexpression  lines maintained higher levels of K(+), proline, and soluble sugar, lower levels  of Na(+) and MDA, and lower Na(+)/K(+) ratios than the wild type. Stress-related  marker genes such as SOS1, AtP5CS1, AtGSTU5, COR15A, RD29A, and RD29B were  expressed at higher levels in the overexpression lines than the wild type and  loss-of-function mutants under salt treatment. These results indicate that AtSIZ1  improves salt tolerance in Arabidopsis by helping plants maintain ionic  homeostasis and osmotic balance.', '2019 Aug', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.05.002', 'Wang']
