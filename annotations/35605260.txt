The RWP-RK protein family is a group of transcription factors containing the RWP-RK DNA-binding domain. This domain is an ancient motif that emerged before the establishment of the Viridiplantae-the green plants, consisting of green algae and land plants. The domain is mostly absent in other kingdoms but widely distributed in Viridiplantae. In green algae, a liverwort, and several angiosperms, RWP-RK proteins play essential roles in nitrogen responses and sexual reproduction-associated processes, which are seemingly unrelated phenomena but possibly interdependent in autotrophs. Consistent with related but diversified roles of the RWP-RK proteins in these organisms, the RWP-RK protein family appears to have expanded intensively, but independently, in the algal and land plant lineages. Thus, bryophyte RWP-RK proteins occupy a unique position in the evolutionary process of establishing the RWP-RK protein family. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the RWP-RK protein family in the Viridiplantae, and discuss the significance of bryophyte RWP-RK proteins in clarifying the relationship between diversification in the RWP-RK protein family and procurement of sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation to the terrestrial environment.
