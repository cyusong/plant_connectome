Aconitate isomerase (EC 5.3.3.7) interconverts cis- and trans-isomers of aconitic acid. Expression of the gene encoding this enzyme was studied in maize (Zea mays L.) leaves depending on light regime. Aconitate isomerase was induced by white and by red light indicating the involvement of phytochrome in the regulation of gene expression. The enzyme was partially purified from maize leaves. The value of Km was 0.75 mM with cis-aconitate and 0.92 mM with trans-aconitate, pH optimum was 8.0-8.2 with both substrates, citrate and malate suppressed its activity. It is concluded that aconitate isomerase actively participates in the interconversion of cis- and trans-aconitate in the light providing a possibility of using the pool of trans-aconitate for the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and mediating citrate/isocitrate supply for the biosynthetic and signaling purposes in photosynthetic cells.
