['20023146', 'Histidine (His) plays a critical role in plant growth and development, both as  one of the standard amino acids in proteins, and as a metal-binding ligand. While  genes encoding seven of the eight enzymes in the pathway of His biosynthesis have  been characterized from a number of plant species, the identity of the enzyme  catalyzing the dephosphorylation of histidinol-phosphate to histidinol has  remained elusive. Recently, members of a novel family of histidinol-phosphate  phosphatase proteins, displaying significant sequence similarity to known  myoinositol monophosphatases (IMPs) have been identified from several  Actinobacteria. Here we demonstrate that a member of the IMP family from  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), myoinositol monophosphatase-like2 (IMPL2;  encoded by At4g39120), has histidinol-phosphate phosphatase activity.  Heterologous expression of IMPL2, but not the related IMPL1 protein, was  sufficient to rescue the His auxotrophy of a Streptomyces coelicolor hisN mutant.  Homozygous null impl2 Arabidopsis mutants displayed embryonic lethality, which  could be rescued by supplying plants heterozygous for null impl2 alleles with  His. In common with the previously characterized HISN genes from Arabidopsis,  IMPL2 was expressed in all plant tissues and throughout development, and an  IMPL2:green fluorescent protein fusion protein was targeted to the plastid, where  His biosynthesis occurs in plants. Our data demonstrate that IMPL2 is the HISN7  gene product, and suggest a lack of genetic redundancy at this metabolic step in  Arabidopsis, which is characteristic of the His biosynthetic pathway.', '2010 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.150805', 'Ingle']
