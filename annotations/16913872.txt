The role of abscisic acid (ABA) and its possible interaction with ethylene in mediating leaf elongation response to soil water deficit are a matter of controversy. To address this question, we used a set of maize genotypes with various levels of ABA either due to natural variability or to genetic transformation targeted on NCED/VP14, a key enzyme of ABA synthesis. The transgenic lines yielded less strong phenotypes than available mutants, making it possible to use them under normal growing conditions. We focused on leaf elongation during night periods in order to avoid the confounding effect of ABA on leaf water status. Our results suggest that over a wide range, internal ABA level (measured in both leaf extracts or xylem sap) has no clear effect on leaf elongation response to soil water deficit, except in the case of an antisense line presenting the strongest reduction in ABA accumulation that showed a slight maintenance of leaf elongation during water deficit. Leaf ethylene production rate was variable and not related to water deficit except in the ABA-deficient transgenic lines where it was increased by water deficit on average but not systematically. Moreover, variability in ethylene production rate was not linked to variability in elongation rate. Our results thus suggest that neither ABA nor ethylene seems to play a major role in the control of leaf elongation response to soil water deficit.
