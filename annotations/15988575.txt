['15988575', 'Each photosynthetic complex within the thylakoid membrane consists of several  different subunits. During formation of these complexes, numerous regulatory  factors are required for the coordinated transport and assembly of the subunits.  Interactions between transport/assembly factors and their specific polypeptides  occur in a membraneous environment and are usually transient and short-lived.  Thus, a detailed analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms by biochemical  techniques is often difficult to perform. Here, we report on the suitability of a  genetic system, i.e. the yeast split-ubiquitin system, to investigate  protein-protein interactions of thylakoid membrane proteins. The data confirm the  previously established binding of the cpSec-translocase subunits, cpSecY and  cpSecE, and the interaction of the cpSec-translocase from Arabidopsis thaliana  with Alb3, a factor required for the insertion of the light-harvesting  chlorophyll-binding proteins into the thylakoid membrane. In addition, the  proposed interaction between D1, the reaction center protein of photosystem II  and the soluble periplasmic PratA factor from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was  verified. A more comprehensive analysis of Alb3-interacting proteins revealed  that Alb3 is able to form dimers or oligomers. Interestingly, Alb3 was also shown  to bind to the PSII proteins D1, D2 and CP43, to the PSI reaction center protein  PSI-A and the ATP synthase subunit CF(0)III, suggesting an important role of Alb3  in the assembly of photosynthetic thylakoid membrane complexes.', '2005 Dec', 'Appl Microbiol Biotechnol', '10.1007/s00253-005-0029-3', 'Schunemann']
