Plant malectin-like receptor kinases (MLRs), also known as Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinase-1-like proteins, are well known for their functions in pollen tube reception and tip growth, cell wall integrity sensing, and hormonal responses. Recently, mounting evidence has indicated a critical role for MLRs in plant immunity. Here we focus on the emerging functions of MLRs in modulating the two-tiered immune system mediated by cell-surface-resident pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs). MLRs complex with PRRs and NLRs and regulate immune receptor complex formation and stability. Rapid alkalinization factor peptide ligands, LORELEI-like glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and cell-wall-associated leucine-rich repeat extensins coordinate with MLRs to orchestrate PRR- and NLR-mediated immunity. We discuss the common theme and unique features of MLR complexes concatenating different branches of plant immune signalling.
