The comparative cytological analysis of the leaf/root growth of Lolium multiflorum has been performed. It revealed differences of the mentioned above/under-ground organs that express the whole plant's polarity. To perform accurate and simultaneous growth comparison a climatic-hydroponics system has been implemented. A sharp increase in the epidermis cell length of the leaf meristem has been detected for the first time. It allows the proposal of a new way to demarcate the boundary of the meristem and suggests a lengthed leaf meristem, that is 4 times longer than the root meristem. As the cell cycle duration in leaves and roots is similar, the prolonged leaf meristem and a higher leaf growth rate could be determined by the longer life span of cells in meristem, resulting in more cell cycles. The prolonged meristem provides a significantly higher leaf growth rate, ensuring a functional balance with roots. The elongation zone of the roots is significantly shorter than in leaves, which is caused by the larger relative root elongation rate and the slower meristemic root growth rate. The novelty formulated, i.e., the prolonged leaf meristem, opens theoretical perspectives in longitudinal zonation, in finding molecular markers and provides practical significance for the biology of productivity.
