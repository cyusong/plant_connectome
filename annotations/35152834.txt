Necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1 (Nep1) -like proteins (NLP) are secreted by multiple taxonomically unrelated plant pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and oomycete) and are best known for inducing cell death and immune responses in dicotyledonous plants. A group of putative <i>NLP</i> genes from obligate biotrophic oomycete <i>Plasmopara viticola</i> were predicted by RNA-Seq in our previous study, but their activity has not been established. Therefore, we analyzed the <i>P. viticola NLP</i> (<i>PvNLP</i>) family and identified seven <i>PvNLP</i> genes. They all belong to type 1 <i>NLP</i> genes and form a <i>P. viticola</i>-specific cluster when compared with other pathogen <i>NLP</i> genes. The expression of <i>PvNLPs</i> was induced during early infection process and the expression patterns could be categorized into two groups. <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated transient expression assays revealed that only PvNLP7 was cytotoxic and could induce <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> resistance in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Functional analysis showed that PvNLP4, PvNLP5, PvNLP7, and PvNLP10 significantly improved disease resistance of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i>. Moreover, the four genes caused an inhibition of plant growth which is typically associated with enhanced immunity when over-expressed in Arabidopsis. Further research found that PvNLP7 could activate the expression of defense-related genes and its conserved NPP1 domain was critical for cell death- and immunity-inducing activity. This record of <i>NLP</i> genes from <i>P. viticola</i> showed a functional diversification, laying a foundation for further study on pathogenic mechanism of the devastating pathogen.
