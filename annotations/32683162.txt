Changes of chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid (Car) contents and their ratio (Car/Chl) represent a sensitive indicator of vegetation photosynthetic activity, developmental changes, and stress responses. The goal of this study was to design methods for estimating Car/Chl in plants across species, seasonal changes and ontogenetic phases requiring no species-specific parameterization. Four tree species (maple, chestnut, beech, and elm), wild vine shrub, and two crops species (maize and soybean) featuring contrasting leaf structure and photosynthetic pathways, a wide variation of pigment content and composition were studied. Two models based on leaf pigment absorption coefficients retrieved from reflectance spectra were proposed and tested. The first model uses the ratio of absorption coefficients at 500 and 700 nm and the second one-the difference between absorption coefficients at 500 and 660 nm. Both models accurately described Car/Chl changes in the range from 0.15 to 0.6 with determination coefficients R<sup>2</sup> of 0.87 for the first model and 0.82 for the second; algorithms for Car/Chl estimation did not require parameterization for each species accurately assessing Car/Chl with normalized root mean square error below 11 % and 14 %, respectively. The findings of a close relationship between leaf absorption coefficients, retrieved from reflectance, and Car/Chl present the first step towards accurate generic quantification of pigment composition and hence the progression of developmental stages, impact of stresses, and potential photosynthetic activity.
