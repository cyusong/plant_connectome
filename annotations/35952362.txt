Climate change is predicted to increase the prevalence of vector-borne disease due to expansion of insect populations. '<i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter solanacearum' is a phloem-limited pathogen associated with multiple economically important diseases in solanaceous crops. Little is known about the strategies and pathogenicity factors '<i>Ca.</i> L. solanacearum' uses to colonize its vector and host. We determined the '<i>Ca.</i> L. solanacearum' effector repertoire by predicting proteins secreted by the general secretory pathway across four different '<i>Ca.</i> L. solanacearum' haplotypes, investigated effector localization in planta, and profiled effector expression in the vector and host. The localization of '<i>Ca.</i> L. solanacearum' effectors in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. revealed diverse eukaryotic subcellular targets. The majority of tested effectors were unable to suppress plant immune responses, indicating they possess unique activities. Expression profiling in tomato and the psyllid <i>Bactericera cockerelli</i> indicated '<i>Ca.</i> L. solanacearum' differentially interacts with its host and vector and can switch effector expression in response to these environments. This study reveals '<i>Ca.</i> L. solanacearum' effectors possess complex expression patterns, target diverse host organelles and the majority are unable to suppress host immune responses. A mechanistic understanding of '<i>Ca.</i> L. solanacearum' effector function will reveal novel targets and provide insight into phloem biology. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
