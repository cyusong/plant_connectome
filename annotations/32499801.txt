['32499801', 'Leaf senescence is a developmental process designed for nutrient recycling and  relocation to maximize growth competence and reproductive capacity of plants.  Thus, plants integrate developmental and environmental signals to precisely  control senescence. To genetically dissect the complex regulatory mechanism  underlying leaf senescence, we identified an early leaf senescence mutant, rse1.  RSE1 encodes a putative glycosyltransferase. Loss-of-function mutations in RSE1  resulted in precocious leaf yellowing and up-regulation of senescence marker  genes, indicating enhanced leaf senescence. Transcriptome analysis revealed that  salicylic acid (SA) and defense signaling cascades were up-regulated in rse1  prior to the onset of leaf senescence. We found that SA accumulation was  significantly increased in rse1. The rse1 phenotypes are dependent on  SA-INDUCTION DEFICIENT 2 (SID2), supporting a role of SA in accelerated leaf  senescence in rse1. Furthermore, RSE1 protein was localized to the cell wall,  implying a possible link between the cell wall and RSE1 function. Together, we  show that RSE1 negatively modulates leaf senescence through an SID2-dependent SA  signaling pathway.', '2020', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2020.00551', 'Kim']
