Detrimental effects of hyperaccumulation of the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) in animals, known as phenylketonuria, are mitigated by excretion of Phe derivatives; however, how plants endure Phe accumulating conditions in the absence of an excretion system is currently unknown. To achieve Phe hyperaccumulation in a plant system, we simultaneously decreased in petunia flowers expression of all three Phe ammonia lyase (PAL) isoforms that catalyze the non-oxidative deamination of Phe to trans-cinnamic acid, the committed step for the major pathway of Phe metabolism. A total decrease in PAL activity by 81-94% led to an 18-fold expansion of the internal Phe pool. Phe accumulation had multifaceted intercompartmental effects on aromatic amino acid metabolism. It resulted in a decrease in the overall flux through the shikimate pathway, and a redirection of carbon flux toward the shikimate-derived aromatic amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan. Accumulation of Phe did not lead to an increase in flux toward phenylacetaldehyde, for which Phe is a direct precursor. Metabolic flux analysis revealed this to be due to the presence of a distinct metabolically inactive pool of Phe, likely localized in the vacuole. We have identified a vacuolar cationic amino acid transporter (PhCAT2) that contributes to sequestering excess of Phe in the vacuole. In vitro assays confirmed PhCAT2 can transport Phe, and decreased PhCAT2 expression in PAL-RNAi transgenic plants resulted in 1.6-fold increase in phenylacetaldehyde emission. These results demonstrate mechanisms by which plants maintain intercompartmental aromatic amino acid homeostasis, and provide critical insight for future phenylpropanoid metabolic engineering strategies.
