The RAV (related to ABI3 and VP1) transcription factors are specific and exist in plants, which contain a B3 DNA binding domain and/or an APETALA2 (AP2) DNA binding domain. <i>RAVs</i> have been extensively studied in plants, and more and more evidences show that <i>RAVs</i> are involved in various aspects of plant growth and development, stress resistance and hormone signal transduction. However, the systematic analysis of <i>RAV</i> family in cucumber is rarely reported. In this study, eight <i>CsRAV</i> genes were identified in cucumber genome and we further comprehensively analyzed their protein physicochemical properties, conserved domains, gene structure and phylogenetic relationships. The synteny analysis and gene duplications of <i>CsRAV</i> genes were also analysed. <i>Cis</i>-element analysis revealed that the <i>CsRAVs</i> promoter contained several elements related to plant hormones and abiotic stress. Expression analysis showed that NaCl and ABA could significantly induce <i>CsRAV</i> genes expression. Subcellular localization revealed that all CsRAVs were localized in the nucleus. In addition, <i>35S</i>:<i>CsRAV1</i> transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> and cucumber seedlings enhanced NaCl and ABA tolerance, revealing <i>CsRAV1</i> may be an important regulator of abiotic stress response. In conclusion, comprehensive analysis of <i>CsRAVs</i> would provide certain reference for understanding the evolution and function of the <i>CsRAV</i> genes.
