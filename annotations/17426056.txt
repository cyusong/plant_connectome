Ultraviolet A (UV-A)-mediated regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis was investigated in swollen hypocotyls of the red turnip 'Tsuda'. The shaded swollen hypocotyls which contained negligible anthocyanin were exposed to artificial light sources including low fluence UV-B, UV-A, blue, red, far-red, red plus UV-A, far-red plus UV-A, and blue plus red. Among these lights, only UV-A induced anthocyanin biosynthesis and co-irradiation of red or far-red with UV-A did not affect the extent of UV-A-induced anthocyanin accumulation. The expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.1.5), chalcone synthase (CHS; EC 2.3.1.74), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H; EC 1.14.11.9), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR; EC 1.1.1.219), and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS; EC 1.14.11.19) genes was increased with time during a 24 h exposure to UV-A. In contrast, irradiation with red, blue, UV-B, and a combination of blue with red failed to induce CHS expression. Microarray analysis showed that only a few genes, including CHS and F3H, were induced significantly by UV-A, while a separate set of many genes was induced by low fluence UV-B. The UV-A-specific induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis and the unique gene expression profile upon UV-A irradiation as compared with blue and UV-B demonstrated that the observed induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in red turnips was mediated by a distinct UV-A-specific photoreceptor, but not by phytochromes, UV-A/blue photoreceptors, or UV-B photoreceptors.
