In contrast to animals, plants maintain highly plastic growth and development throughout their life, which enables them to adapt to environmental fluctuations. Phytohormones coordinately regulate these adaptations by integrating environmental inputs into a complex signalling network. In this review, the focus is on the rapid elongation that occurs in response to canopy shading or submergence, and current knowledge and recent advances in deciphering the network of phytohormone signalling that regulates this response are explored. The review concentrates on the involvement of the phytohormones auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, and ethylene. Despite the occurrence of considerable gaps in current understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, it was possible to identify a network of phytohormone signalling intermediates at multiple levels that regulates elongation growth in response to canopy shade or submergence. Based on the observations that there are spatial and temporal differences in the interactions of phytohormones, the importance of more integrative approaches for future studies is highlighted.
