The AVRPPHB SUSCEPTIBLE1 (PBS1) and RESISTANCE TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE 5 (RPS5) proteins are involved in signal transduction to evoke innate plant immune response. In Arabidopsis, PBS1 is cleaved by the AvrPphB (<i>Pseudomonas phaseolicola</i> Avirulence protein B) protease, activating RPS5 and turning in a hypersensitive response (HR). We searched for PBS1 orthologs to trace their origin and evolution. PBS1 orthologs were found in embryophytes and in other plant taxa but with lower similarity. PBS1 phylogenetic analysis indicates high divergence, suggesting that the decoy function described for Arabidopsis PBS1 might be associated with a small fraction of orthologs. Ancestral reconstruction analysis suggests an elevated diversity in the amino acid sequence within the described motifs. All the orthologs contain the conserved PBS1 kinase subdomains, whereas the cleavage motif is present in several embryophyte orthologs but absent in most other taxa. The putative resistance recognition motifs in PBS1 orthologs are highly diverse. PBS1 cleavage site motif is exposed in some 3D structure predictions, whereas it is not in others, suggesting different modes of regulation and functions in PBS1 orthologs. Our findings suggest that PBS1 originated in the lineage that gave rise to embryophytes, with the angiosperm sequences forming a separate clade from pteridophyte proteins.
