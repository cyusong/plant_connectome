As a key integrator of shoot branching, BRANCHED 1 (BRC1) coordinates and is orchestrated by endogenous and environmental signals involved in the regulation of axillary bud outgrowth. In the present study, we characterized the regulatory roles of five BRC gene members in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) using CRISPR site-directed mutagenesis and overexpression assays. It was shown that lateral branching was negatively regulated by NtBRC1A-1, 1B-1, and 1B-2, but was unexpectedly promoted by NtBRC2A. Suppression of bud growth may be attained by direct binding of NtBRCs to the Tassels Replace Upper Ears 1 (TRU1) genes. It was speculated that NtBRC2A probably confers a dominant negative effect by interfering with the branching-inhibitory BRC1 genes. Our results suggested that highly homologous gene family members may function antagonistically in the same signaling pathway. However, the molecular mechanism underlying NtBRC2A-mediated outgrowth of axillary buds needs to be further addressed. KEY MESSAGE: Axillary bud outgrowth in general is negatively regulated by the BRANCHED gene. Here we show that the BRANCHED genes play opposing regulatory roles in tobacco lateral branching.
