The mammalian <i>BREAST CANCER 2</i> (<i>BRCA2</i>) gene is a tumor suppressor that plays a crucial role in DNA repair and homologous recombination (HR). Here, we report the identification and characterization of <i>OsBRCA2</i>, the rice orthologue of human <i>BRCA2</i>. <i>Osbrca2</i> mutant plants exhibit normal vegetative growth but experience complete male and female sterility as a consequence of severe meiotic defects. Pairing, synapsis and recombination are impaired in <i>osbrca2</i> male meiocytes, leading to chromosome entanglements and fragmentation. In the absence of OsBRCA2, localization to the meiotic chromosome axes of the strand-invasion proteins OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 is severely reduced and <i>in vitro</i> OsBRCA2 directly interacts with OsRAD51 and OsDMC1. These results indicate that OsBRCA2 is essential for facilitating the loading of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 onto resected ends of programmed double-strand breaks (DSB) during meiosis to promote single-end invasions of homologous chromosomes and accurate recombination. In addition, treatment of <i>osbrca2-1</i> seedlings with mitomycin C (MMC) led to hypersensitivity. As MMC is a genotoxic agent that creates DNA lesions in the somatic cells that can only be repaired by HR, these results suggest that OsBRCA2 has a conserved role in DSB repair and HR in rice.
