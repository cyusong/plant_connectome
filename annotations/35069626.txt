Soybean pubescence plays an important role in insect resistance, drought tolerance, and other stresses. Hence, a deep understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying pubescence is a prerequisite to a deeper understanding of insect resistance and drought tolerance. In the present study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of pubescence traits was performed using a high-density inter-specific linkage map of one recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, designated NJRINP. It was observed that pubescence length (PL) was negatively correlated with pubescence density (PD). A total of 10 and 9 QTLs distributed on six and five chromosomes were identified with phenotypic variance (PV) of 3.0-9.9% and 0.8-15.8% for PL and PD, respectively, out of which, eight and five were novel. Most decreased PL (8 of 10) and increased PD (8 of 9) alleles were from the wild soybean <i>PI 342618B</i>. Based on gene annotation, Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships and literature search, 21 and 12 candidate genes were identified related to PL and PD, respectively. In addition, <i>Glyma.12G187200</i> from major QTLs <i>qPL-12-1</i> and <i>qPD-12-2</i>, was identified as <i>Ps</i> (sparse pubescence) before, having an expression level of fivefold greater in <i>NN 86-4</i> than in <i>PI 342618B</i>, hence it might be the candidate gene that is conferring both PL and PD. Based on gene expression and cluster analysis, three and four genes were considered as the important candidate genes of PL and PD, respectively. Besides, leaves with short and dense (SD) pubescence, which are similar to the wild soybean pubescence morphology, had the highest resistance to common cutworm (CCW) in soybean. In conclusion, the findings in the present study provide a better understanding of genetic basis and candidate genes information of PL and PD and the relationship with resistance to CCW in soybean.
