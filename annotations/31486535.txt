The structural and functional integrity of the cell wall needs to be constantly monitored and fine-tuned to allow for growth while preventing mechanical failure. Many studies have advanced our understanding of the pathways that contribute to cell wall biosynthesis and how these pathways are regulated by external and internal cues. Recent evidence also supports a model in which certain aspects of the wall itself may act as growth-regulating signals. Molecular components of the signaling pathways that sense and maintain cell wall integrity have begun to be revealed, including signals arising in the wall, sensors that detect changes at the cell surface, and downstream signal transduction modules. Abiotic and biotic stress conditions provide new contexts for the study of cell wall integrity, but the nature and consequences of wall disruptions due to various stressors require further investigation. A deeper understanding of cell wall signaling will provide insights into the growth regulatory mechanisms that allow plants to survive in changing environments.
