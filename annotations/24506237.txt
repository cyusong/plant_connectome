['24506237', 'Carotenoid pigments are indispensable for plant life. They are synthesized within  plastids where they provide essential functions in photosynthesis. Carotenoids  serve as precursors for the synthesis of the strigolactone phytohormones, which  are made from beta-carotene, and of abscisic acid (ABA), which is produced from  certain xanthophylls. Despite the significant progress that has been made in our  understanding of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, the synthesis of the  xanthophyll neoxanthin has remained unknown. We report here on the isolation of a  tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) mutant, neoxanthin-deficient 1 (nxd1), which lacks  neoxanthin, and on the cloning of a gene that is necessary for neoxanthin  synthesis in both tomato and Arabidopsis. The locus nxd1 encodes a gene of  unknown function that is conserved in all higher plants. The activity of NXD1 is  essential but cannot solely support neoxanthin synthesis. Lack of neoxanthin does  not significantly reduce the fitness of tomato plants in cultivated field  conditions and does not impair the synthesis of ABA, suggesting that in tomato  violaxanthin is a sufficient precursor for ABA production in vivo.', '2014 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12451', 'Hirschberg']
