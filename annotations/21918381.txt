In a large group of fungi, mating results in a dikaryon, a cell in which the two nuclei--one from each parent cell--share a single cytoplasm for a period of time without undergoing nuclear fusion. The dikaryon stage is typical in the life cycles of many fungal species primarily in the Basidiomycota, a large group that includes mushrooms, bracket fungi and many phytopathogenic fungi, such as the corn pathogen Ustilago maydis. Recently, we described that in U. maydis two conserved DNA-damage checkpoint kinases, Chk1 and Atr1, work together to control the dikaryon formation. However, how this pathway is activated during the dikaryon formation and how its activation/deactivation is coordinated with the different cell cycle phases is unknown. Here we propose and discuss several hypothesis to address these questions.

Chk1: !controls! dikaryon formation
Atr1: !controls! dikaryon formation
U. maydis: !contains! Chk1 and Atr1
U. maydis: !activates! Chk1 and Atr1
