Improving the overall production of rice with high quality is a major target of breeders. Mining potential yield-related loci have been geared towards developing efficient rice breeding strategies. In this study, one single-locus genome-wide association studies (SL-GWAS) method (MLM) in conjunction with five multi-locus genome-wide association studies (ML-GWAS) approaches (mrMLM, FASTmrMLM, pLARmEB, pKWmEB, and ISIS EM-BLASSO) were conducted in a panel consisting of 529 rice core varieties with 607,201 SNPs. A total of 152, 106, 12, 111, and 64 SNPs were detected by the MLM model associated with the five yield-related traits, namely grain length (GL), grain width (GW), grain thickness (GT), thousand-grain weight (TGW), and yield per plant (YPP), respectively. Furthermore, 74 significant quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were presented across at least two ML-GWAS methods to be associated with the above five traits successively. Finally, 20 common QTNs were simultaneously discovered by both SL-GWAS and ML-GWAS methods. Based on genome annotation, gene expression analysis, and previous studies, two candidate key genes (LOC_Os09g02830 and LOC_Os07g31450) were characterized to affect GW and TGW, separately. These outcomes will provide an indication for breeding high-yielding rice varieties in the immediate future.
