['15269331', 'The hypersensitive response (HR) is a programmed cell death that is commonly  associated with plant disease resistance. A novel lesion mimic mutant, vad1 (for  vascular associated death1), that exhibits light conditional appearance of  propagative HR-like lesions along the vascular system was identified. Lesion  formation is associated with expression of defense genes, production of high  levels of salicylic acid (SA), and increased resistance to virulent and avirulent  strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato. Analyses of the progeny from crosses  between vad1 plants and either nahG transgenic plants, sid1, nonexpressor of PR1  (npr1), enhanced disease susceptibility1 (eds1), or non-race specific disease  resistance1 (ndr1) mutants, revealed the vad1 cell death phenotype to be  dependent on SA biosynthesis but NPR1 independent; in addition, both EDS1 and  NDR1 are necessary for the proper timing and amplification of cell death as well  as for increased resistance to Pseudomonas strains. VAD1 encodes a novel putative  membrane-associated protein containing a GRAM domain, a lipid or protein binding  signaling domain, and is expressed in response to pathogen infection at the  vicinity of the hypersensitive lesions. VAD1 might thus represent a new potential  function in cell death control associated with cells in the vicinity of vascular  bundles.', '2004 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.022038', 'Roby']
