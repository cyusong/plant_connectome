Soil salinization is an important factor threatening the yield and quality of maize. Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a considerable role in regulating plant growth under salt stress. Herein, we examined the shoot Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, root Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and transport coefficients of seedlings in an association panel composed of 305 maize inbred lines under normal and salt conditions. A genome-wide association study was conducted by using the investigated phenotypes and 46,408 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the panel. As a result, 53 significant SNPs were specifically detected under salt treatment, and 544 genes were identified in the linkage disequilibrium regions of these SNPs. According to the expression data of the 544 genes, we carried out a weighted coexpression network analysis. Combining the enrichment analyses and functional annotations, four hub genes (GRMZM2G051032, GRMZM2G004314, GRMZM2G421669, and GRMZM2G123314) were finally determined, which were then used to evaluate the genetic variation effects by gene-based association analysis. Only GRMZM2G123314, which encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein, was significantly associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport and the haplotype G-CT was identified as the superior haplotype. Our study brings novel insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms of salt stress response and contributes to the development of salt-tolerant varieties in maize.
