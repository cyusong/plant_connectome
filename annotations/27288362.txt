['27288362', 'Seed dormancy controls the timing of germination, which regulates the adaptation  of plants to their environment and influences agricultural production. The time  of germination is under strong natural selection and shows variation within  species due to local adaptation. The identification of genes underlying dormancy  quantitative trait loci is a major scientific challenge, which is relevant for  agricultural and ecological goals. In this study, we describe the identification  of the DELAY OF GERMINATION18 (DOG18) quantitative trait locus, which was  identified as a factor in natural variation for seed dormancy in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). DOG18 encodes a member of the clade A of the type 2C  protein phosphatases family, which we previously identified as the REDUCED  DORMANCY5 (RDO5) gene. DOG18/RDO5 shows a relatively high frequency of  loss-of-function alleles in natural accessions restricted to northwestern Europe.  The loss of dormancy in these loss-of-function alleles can be compensated for by  genetic factors like DOG1 and DOG6, and by environmental factors such as low  temperature. RDO5 does not have detectable phosphatase activity. Analysis of the  phosphoproteome in dry and imbibed seeds revealed a general decrease in protein  phosphorylation during seed imbibition that is enhanced in the rdo5 mutant. We  conclude that RDO5 acts as a pseudophosphatase that inhibits dephosphorylation  during seed imbibition.', '2016 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.00525', 'Soppe']
