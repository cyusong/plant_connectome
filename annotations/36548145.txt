Plant root growth and developmental capacities reside in a few stem cells of the root apical meristem (RAM). Maintenance of these stem cells requires regenerative divisions of the initial stem cell niche (SCN) cells, self-maintenance, and proliferative divisions of the daughter cells. This ensures sufficient cell diversity to guarantee the development of complex root tissues in the plant. Damage in the root during growth involves the formation of a new post-embryonic root, a process known as regeneration. Post-embryonic root development and organogenesis processes include primary root (PR) development and SCN maintenance, plant regeneration and the development of adventitious and lateral roots. These developmental processes require a fine-tuned balance between cell proliferation and maintenance. An important regulator during root development and regeneration is the gasotransmitter nitric oxide (NO). In this review we have sought to compile how NO regulates cell rate proliferation, cell differentiation, and quiescence of SCNs, usually through interaction with phytohormones, or other molecular mechanisms involved in cellular redox homeostasis. NO exerts a role on molecular components of the auxin (Aux) and cytokinin (CK) signaling pathways in PR that affects cell proliferation and maintenance of the RAM. During root regeneration, a peak of Aux and CKs triggers specific molecular programs. Moreover, NO participates in adventitious root formation through its interaction with players of the brassinosteroids (BRs) and CKs signaling cascade. Lately, NO has been implicated in root regeneration under hypoxia conditions by regulating stem cell specification through phytoglobins.
