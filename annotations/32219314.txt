Carnivorous plants within the order Caryophyllales use jasmonates, a class of phytohormone, in the regulation of digestive enzyme activities. We used the carnivorous butterwort Pinguicula × Tina from the order Lamiales to investigate whether jasmonate signaling is a universal and ubiquitous signaling pathway that exists outside the order Caryophyllales. We measured the electrical signals, enzyme activities, and phytohormone tissue levels in response to prey capture. Mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins in the digestive secretion. We identified eight enzymes in the digestive secretion, many of which were previously found in other genera of carnivorous plants. Among them, alpha-amylase is unique in carnivorous plants. Enzymatic activities increased in response to prey capture; however, the tissue content of jasmonic acid and its isoleucine conjugate remained rather low in contrast to the jasmonate response to wounding. Enzyme activities did not increase in response to the exogenous application of jasmonic acid or coronatine. Whereas similar digestive enzymes were co-opted from plant defense mechanisms among carnivorous plants, the mode of their regulation differs. The butterwort has not co-opted jasmonate signaling for the induction of enzyme activities in response to prey capture. Moreover, the presence of alpha-amylase in digestive fluid of P. × Tina, which has not been found in other genera of carnivorous plants, might indicate that non-defense-related genes have also been co-opted for carnivory.
