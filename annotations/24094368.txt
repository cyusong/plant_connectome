Salinity is one of the major environmental limiting factors that affects growth and productivity of rice (Oryza sativa L.) worldwide. Rice is among the most sensitive crops to salinity, especially at early vegetative stages. In order to get a better understanding of molecular pathways affected in rice mutants showing contrasting responses to salinity, we exploited the power of 2-DE based proteomics to explore the proteome changes associated with salt stress response. Our physiological observations showed that standard evaluation system (SES) scores, Na+ and K+ concentrations in shoots and Na+/K+ ratio were significantly different in contrasting mutants under salt stress condition. Proteomics analysis showed that, out of 854 protein spots which were reproducibly detected, 67 protein spots showed significant responses to salt stress. The tandem mass spectrometry analysis of these significantly differentially accumulated proteins resulted in identification of 34 unique proteins. These proteins are involved in various molecular processes including defense to oxidative stresses, metabolisms, photosynthesis, protein synthesis and processing, signal transduction. Several of the identified proteins were emerged as key participants in salt stress tolerance. The possible implication of salt responsive proteins in plant adaptation to salt stress is discussed.
