In plants, SIZ1 regulates abiotic and biotic stress responses by promoting the SUMOylation of proteins. The apple MdSIZ1 protein has conserved domains similar to those of Arabidopsis AtSIZ1. Real-time fluorescent quantitative analysis showed that MdSIZ1 gene expression was induced by phosphate-deficient conditions. In addition, the level of SUMOylation was also significantly increased under these conditions. The MYB transcription factor MdPHR1 might be a target for the SUMO protein, which is a phosphorus starvation-dependent protein. Subsequently, an MdSIZ1 expression vector was constructed and transformed in Arabidopsis mutant siz1-2 and apple callus. The MdSIZ1 transgenic Arabidopsis partially complemented the defect phenotype of siz1-2 under phosphate-deficient conditions. The survival rate, length of primary root, and number or density of lateral roots were similar between the transgenic lines and wild type (WT). Under phosphate-deficient conditions, the SUMO conjugate and fresh weight of the MdSIZ1 transgenic apple callus were improved compared with WT. The MdSIZ1 transgenic apple callus grew under phosphate-deficient conditions, whereas the MdSIZ1 sense apple callus did not. Therefore, MdSIZ1 is involved in the regulation of the phosphate-deficiency response in apple.
