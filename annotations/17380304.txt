['17380304', 'Flowering is regulated by a network integrated from four major pathways,  including the photoperiod, vernalization, gibberellin, and autonomous pathways.  RNA processing within the autonomous pathway is well known to regulate  Arabidopsis thaliana flowering time. Here we identify a novel Arabidopsis gene,  designated AT PRP39-1, that affects flowering time. Based on observations that  homozygous at prp39-1 plants are late flowering under both long and short days  and responsive to GA and vernalization treatment, we tentatively conclude that AT  PRP39-1 may represent a new component of the autonomous pathway. Consistent with  previous studies on genes of the autonomous pathway, knockout of AT PRP39-1 in  Arabidopsis displays an upregulation of the steady state level of FLC, and  simultaneous downregulation of FT and SOC1 transcript levels in adult tissues. AT  PRP39-1 encodes a tetratricopeptide repeat protein with a similarity to a yeast  mRNA processing protein Prp39p, suggesting that the involvement of these  tetratricopeptide repeat proteins in RNA processing is conserved among yeast,  human, and plants. Structure modeling suggests that AT PRP39-1 has two TPR  superhelical domains suitable for target protein binding. We discuss how AT  PRP39-1 may function in the control of flowering in the context of the autonomous  pathway.', '2007 Aug', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-007-0336-5', 'Olsen']
