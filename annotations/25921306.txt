['25921306', 'Members of the universal stress protein (USP) family are conserved in a  phylogenetically diverse range of prokaryotes, fungi, protists, and plants and  confer abilities to respond to a wide range of environmental stresses.  Arabidopsis thaliana contains 44 USP domain-containing proteins, and USP domain  is found either in a small protein with unknown physiological function or in an  N-terminal portion of a multi-domain protein, usually a protein kinase. Here, we  report the first crystal structure of a eukaryotic USP-like protein encoded from  the gene At3g01520. The crystal structure of the protein At3g01520 was determined  by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method and refined to an R factor  of 21.8% (Rfree = 26.1%) at 2.5 A resolution. The crystal structure includes  three At3g01520 protein dimers with one AMP molecule bound to each protomer,  comprising a Rossmann-like alpha/beta overall fold. The bound AMP and conservation of  residues in the ATP-binding loop suggest that the protein At3g01520 also belongs  to the ATP-binding USP subfamily members.', '2015 Jul', 'Proteins', '10.1002/prot.24821', 'Phillips']
