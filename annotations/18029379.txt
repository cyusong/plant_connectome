To understand the autoregulation of nodulation (AON) system, in which leguminous plants control the nodule number, we examined the details of the characteristics of hypernodulation soybean mutants NOD1-3 and NOD3-7. A microscopic study showed that NOD1-3 and NOD3-7 produced small-size leaves due to the smaller number of leaf cells, compared with the Williams parent. These phenotypes were not affected by inoculation with bradyrhizobia or nitrate supply. The AON signaling might be related to the control system of leaf cell proliferation. This hypothesis was strongly supported by the finding that activation of AON in wild types by inoculation leads to an increase in the cell number of leaves.

NOD1-3: !produces! small-size leaves
NOD3-7: !produces! small-size leaves
AON: !controls! leaf cell proliferation
inoculation: !activates! AON
AON: !increases! cell number of leaves
