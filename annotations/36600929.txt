Powdery mildews (PM) are common and severe pathogen groups that threaten plants, and PM resistance is complex and polygenic in cucumbers. Previously <i>mlo</i>-based resistance was reported in various plants, including cucumber, with generated loss-of <i>CsaMLO</i> function mutants. However, <i>mlo</i>-based resistance in cucumber is also complex and involves additional mechanisms such as hypersensitive response (HR) and papillae formation. For this reason, we focused on determining the <i>mlo</i>-based powdery mildew resistance mechanism in cucumber. CRISPR/Cas9 was used in the present study to generate loss-of-function mutants for <i>CsaMLO1</i>, <i>CsaMLO8</i>, and <i>CsaMLO11</i> of PM susceptible ADR27 cucumber inbred lines and <i>CsaMLO</i> mutants were obtained and validated. Trypan Blue and DAB staining were performed to detect <i>Podosphaera xanthii</i> germination/penetration rates and accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Our results indicate that PM-susceptibility associated <i>CsaMLO</i>s in cucumber are negative regulators in different defense mechanisms against powdery mildew at early and late stages of infection. Further, the experiment results indicated that <i>CsaMLO8</i> mutation-based resistance was associated with the pre-invasive response, while <i>CsaMLO1</i> and <i>CsaMLO11</i> could be negative regulators in the post-invasive defense response in cucumber against <i>P</i>. <i>xanthii</i>. Although the loss-of <i>CsaMLO8</i> function confers the highest penetration resistance, <i>CsaMLO1</i> and <i>CsaMLO11</i> double mutations could be potential candidates for HR-based resistance against PM pathogen in cucumber. These results highlighted the crucial role of CRISPR/Cas9 to develop PM resistant cucumber cultivars, possessing strong pre-invasive defense with <i>CsaMLO8</i> or post-invasive with <i>CsaMLO1</i>/<i>CsaMLO11</i> mutations.
