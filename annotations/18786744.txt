The regulation of endogenous level of ascorbic acid in soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) by cryptic red light signal (CRS) was studied. CRS is a cellular signal induced by red light pre-irradiation that amplifies the action of phytochrome, and is known to enhance anthocyanin synthesis in sorghum. A phytochrome-enhanced endogenous level of ascorbic acid in soybean seedlings was amplified by CRS. The lifetime of CRS was from 0 to 2h and the peak of enhancement was between 16 and 24h of dark incubation after the end of treatment.
