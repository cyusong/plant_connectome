The gene balance hypothesis states that the stoichiometry of members of multisubunit complexes affects the function of the whole because of the kinetics and mode of assembly. Gene regulatory mechanisms also would be governed by these principles. Here, we review the impact of this concept with regard to the effects on the genetics of quantitative traits, the fate of duplication of genes following polyploidization events or segmental duplication, the basis of aneuploid syndromes, the constraints on cis and trans variation in gene regulation and the potential involvement in hybrid incompatibilities.

Gene: !affects! Function 
Stoichiometry: !governs! Kinetics 
Duplication: !follows! Polyploidization 
Aneuploidy: !causes! Syndromes 
Variation: !constrains! Regulation 
Hybrid: !involves! Incompatibilities
