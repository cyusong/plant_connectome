ArrayExpress is a public microarray repository founded on the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) principles that stores MIAME-compliant gene expression data. Plant-based data sets represent approximately one-quarter of the experiments in ArrayExpress. The majority are based on Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana); however, there are other data sets based on Triticum aestivum, Hordeum vulgare, and Populus subsp. AtMIAMExpress is an open-source Web-based software application for the submission of Arabidopsis-based microarray data to ArrayExpress. AtMIAMExpress exports data in MAGE-ML format for upload to any MAGE-ML-compliant application, such as J-Express and ArrayExpress. It was designed as a tool for users with minimal bioinformatics expertise, has comprehensive help and user support, and represents a simple solution to meeting the MIAME guidelines for the Arabidopsis community. Plant data are queryable both in ArrayExpress and in the Data Warehouse databases, which support queries based on gene-centric and sample-centric annotation. The AtMIAMExpress submission tool is available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/at-miamexpress/. The software is open source and is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/miamexpress/.
