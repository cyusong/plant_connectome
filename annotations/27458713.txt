DNA lesions such as crosslinks represent obstacles for the replication machinery. Nonetheless, replication can proceed via the DNA damage tolerance pathway also known as postreplicative repair pathway. SNF2 ATPase Rad5 homologs, such as RAD5A of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, are important for the error-free mode of this pathway. We able to demonstrate before, that RAD5A is a key factor in the repair of DNA crosslinks in Arabidopsis. Here, we show by in vitro analysis that AtRAD5A protein is a DNA translocase able to catalyse fork regression. Interestingly, replication forks with a gap in the leading strand are processed best, in line with its suggested function. Furthermore AtRAD5A catalyses branch migration of a Holliday junction and is furthermore not impaired by the DNA binding of a model protein, which is indicative of its ability to displace other proteins. Rad5 homologs possess HIRAN (Hip116, Rad5; N-terminal) domains. By biochemical analysis we were able to demonstrate that the HIRAN domain variant from Arabidopsis RAD5A mediates structure selective DNA binding without the necessity for a free 3'OH group as has been shown to be required for binding of HIRAN domains in a mammalian RAD5 homolog. The biological importance of the HIRAN domain in AtRAD5A is demonstrated by our result that it is required for its function in DNA crosslink repair in vivo.
