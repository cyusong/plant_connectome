We recently identified a novel R1 MYB transcription factor, GmMYB176, which regulates the CHS8 gene expression and influences isoflavonoid biosynthesis in soybeans. GmMYB176 recognizes a unique sequence motif [TAGT(T/A)(A/T)] in CHS8 promoter and binds with it. The in planta role of GmMYB176 was established by RNAi silencing of GmMYB176 in soybean hairy roots. Silencing of GmMYB176 reduced the expression of CHS8 gene expression and isoflavonoid accumulation in hairy roots. However, the overexpression of GmMYB176 did not lead to increase in both CHS8 expression and isoflavonoid level in hairy roots suggesting that GmMYB176 is essential but not sufficient for CHS8 gene activation.

GmMYB176: !influences! isoflavonoid biosynthesis
RNAi silencing: !reduces! GmMYB176 expression
RNAi silencing: !reduces! CHS8 expression
RNAi silencing: !reduces! isoflavonoid accumulation
Overexpression: !does not lead to increase! in CHS8 expression
