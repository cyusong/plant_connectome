['27264339', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important phytohormone that controls several plant  processes such as seed germination, seedling growth, and abiotic stress response.  Here, we report that AtYak1 plays an important role in ABA signaling and  postgermination growth in Arabidopsis. AtYak1 knockout mutant plants were  hyposensitive to ABA inhibition of seed germination, cotyledon greening, seedling  growth, and stomatal movement. atyak1-1 mutant plants display reduced drought  stress resistance, as evidenced by water loss rate and survival rate. Molecular  genetic analysis revealed that AtYak1 deficiency led to elevated expression of  stomatal-related gene, MYB60, and down-regulation of several stress-responsive  genes. Altogether, these results indicate that AtYak1 plays a role as a positive  regulator in ABA-mediated drought response in Arabidopsis.', '2016 Jul', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1002/1873-3468.12234', 'Xiong']
