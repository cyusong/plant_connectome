['12140326', 'ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling plays a central role in the regulation of  access to chromatin DNA. Swi/Snf remodeling complexes characterized in yeast,  Drosophila and mammals all contain a conserved set of core subunits composed of  homologs of yeast SNF2-type DNA-dependent ATPase, SNF5 and SWI3 proteins. So far,  no complete Swi/Snf-type complex has been characterized in plants. Arabidopsis  contains a single SNF5-type gene, BSH, which has been shown to complement the  yeast snf5 mutation. Here we describe the characterization of AtSWI3B, the  smallest of the four Arabidopsis homologs of SWI3. The gene encoding AtSWI3B is  expressed ubiquitously in the plant. AtSWI3B is localized to nuclei and is  associated mostly with the chromatin and soluble protein fractions. When  expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cDNA encoding AtSWI3B partially  complements the swi3 mutant phenotype. However, like BSH, AtSWI3B is unable to  activate transcription in yeast when tethered to DNA. The analysis by yeast  two-hybrid indicates that AtSWI3B is capable of forming homodimers and interacts  with BSH as well as with two other members of the Arabidopsis SWI3 family:  AtSWI3A and AtSWI3C. The results of phage display screen using recombinant  protein, confirmed by direct yeast two-hybrid analyses, indicate that AtSWI3B  interacts with FCA, a regulator of flowering time in Arabidopsis. This  interaction is through the C-terminal region of FCA, located outside the  conserved RNA- and protein-binding domains of this protein.', '2002 Aug 1', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkf458', 'Jerzmanowski']
