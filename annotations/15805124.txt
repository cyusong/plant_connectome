NodMl-V(C(18:1), Me, Cb, AcFuc) is a major component of lipo-chitin oligosaccharides (LCOs), or Nod factors, produced by Mesorhizobium loti. The presence of a 4-O-acetylated fucosyl residue (AcFuc) at the reducing end has been thought to be essential for symbiotic interactions with the compatible host plant, Lotus japonicus. We generated an M. loti mutant in which the nolL gene is disrupted; nolL has been shown to encode acetyltransferase that is responsible for acetylation of the fucosyl residue. The nolL disruptant Ml107 produced LCOs that lacked acetylation of fucosyl residues as expected, but exhibited nodulation performance on L. japonicus as efficiently as the wild-type M. loti strain MAFF303099. We show that LCOs without acetylation of a fucosyl residue purified from Ml107 are also able to induce abundant root hair deformation and nodule primordium formation. These results indicate that NolL-dependent acetylation of a fucosyl residue at the reducing end of M. loti LCOs is not essential for nodulation of L. japonicus.
