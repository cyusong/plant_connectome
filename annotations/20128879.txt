The integrity of the genome is a fundamental prerequisite for the well-being of all living organisms. Critical for the genomic integrity are effective DNA damage detection mechanisms that enable the cell to rapidly activate the necessary repair machinery. Here, we describe Arabidopsis thaliana ATCSA-1, which is an ortholog of the mammalian Cockayne Syndrome type-A protein involved in transcription-coupled DNA repair processes. ATCSA-1 is a critical component for initiating the repair of UV-B-induced DNA lesions, and, together with the damage-specific DNA binding protein 2 (DDB2), is necessary for light-independent repair processes in Arabidopsis. The transcriptional profile of both genes revealed that ATCSA-1 is strongly expressed in most tissues, whereas DDB2 is only weakly expressed, predominantly in the root tips and anthers of flowers. In contrast to ATCSA-1, DDB2 expression is rapidly inducible by UV treatment. Like DDB2, ATCSA-1 is localized to the nucleus, and assembles with DDB1 and CUL4 proteins into a complex. ATCSA-1 is an unstable protein that is degraded in a 26S proteasome-dependent manner. Overall, the results presented here form a functional description of a plant Cockayne syndrome factor A (CSA) ortholog, and demonstrate the importance of ATCSA-1 for UV-B tolerance.
