Citrus fruit are generally confronted with various fungal diseases that cause fruit deterioration and economic loss. Salicylic acid (SA), a plant hormone, is an important signal molecule required for stimulating the disease resistance of plants. However, there has been limited information about the molecular mechanism of SA biosynthesis involving biotic stress response in citrus fruit. In the present study, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor (CsMYB96) was identified to mediate SA signaling in response to fungal diseases. The transient overexpression assay revealed that CsMYB96 contributed to the strong tolerance of citrus fruit to Penicillium italicum along with an increase in SA content; meanwhile, CsMYB96 conferred resistance to Botrytis cinerea in Arabidopsis plants. Further metabolomic profiling of stable transgenic Arabidopsis revealed that CsMYB96 participated in the regulation of various metabolism pathways and enhanced the accumulation of phenolic acids. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that overexpression of CsMYB96 activated the expression of genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and SA signaling. Besides, CsMBY96 directly activated the transcription of calmodulin binding protein 60g (CsCBP60g), a predominant transcription factor required for the activation of SA signaling. In summary, our results reveal that CsMYB96 promotes SA biosynthesis and the accumulation of defense metabolites to enhance the fungal pathogen resistance of citrus fruit and Arabidopsis and provide new insights into the regulation of disease response.
