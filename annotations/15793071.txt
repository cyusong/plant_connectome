The soybean apyrase, GS52, was previously characterized as an early nodulin that is expressed in roots and localized to the plasma membrane. Transgenic Lotus japonicus plants were constructed constitutively expressing the GS52 apyrase. Segregation and Southern-blot analysis identified four single-copy sense lines, several double-copy sense lines, and one double-copy antisense line for further analysis. The single- and double-copy sense gs52 L. japonicus lines had enhanced nodulation that correlated with expression of the transgene. The sense transgenic lines were also found to have increased infection thread formation and enhanced infection zone length when infected by Mesorhizobium loti, the natural symbiont of L. japonicus. The data presented show that expression of the GS52 apyrase can enhance nodulation in L. japonicus and points to an important role for this group of enzymes in nodulation.
