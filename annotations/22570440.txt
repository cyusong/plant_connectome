Guard cell actin reorganization has been observed in stomatal responses to a wide array of stimuli. However, how the guard cell signaling machinery regulates actin dynamics is poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of an allele of the Arabidopsis thaliana ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN C2/DISTORTED TRICHOMES2 (ARPC2) locus (encoding the ARPC2 subunit of the ARP2/3 complex) designated high sugar response3 (hsr3). The hsr3 mutant showed increased transpirational water loss that was mainly due to a lesion in stomatal regulation. Stomatal bioassay analyses revealed that guard cell sensitivity to external stimuli, such as abscisic acid (ABA), CaCl(2), and light/dark transition, was reduced or abolished in hsr3. Analysis of a nonallelic mutant of the ARP2/3 complex suggested no pleiotropic effect of ARPC2 beyond its function in the complex in regard to stomatal regulation. When treated with ABA, guard cell actin filaments underwent fast disruption in wild-type plants, whereas those in hsr3 remained largely bundled. The ABA insensitivity phenotype of hsr3 was rescued by cytochalasin D treatment, suggesting that the aberrant stomatal response was a consequence of bundled actin filaments. Our work indicates that regulation of actin reassembly through ARP2/3 complex activity is crucial for stomatal regulation.
