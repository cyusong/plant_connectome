The SKU5 similar (SKS) genes encode a family of multi-copper-oxidase-like proteins with cupredoxin domains similar to those in laccase and ascorbate oxidase. Although SKS proteins are known to function in root growth and cotyledon vascular patterning in Arabidopsis, their role in plant reproductive processes is poorly understood. Here, we identified a seed mutant of maize (Zea mays), generated by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis, that we designated defective kernel-zk1 (dek-zk1). The mutant produced small, shriveled kernels with an aberrant basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) and placento-chalazal (PC) layer and irregular starch granules. Map-based cloning revealed that Dek-zk1 encodes an SKU5 similar 13 (GenBank: ONM36900.1), so it was named ZmSKS13. ZmSKS13 comprises a paralogous pair with Zm00001d012524, but the transcript abundance of ZmSKS13 in developing kernels is 15 times higher than that of Zm00001d012524, resulting in dek-zk1 mutation conveying a distinct kernel phenotype. ZmSKS13 loss of function led to overaccumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and severe DNA damage in the nucellus and BETL and PC layer cells, and exogenous antioxidants significantly alleviated the defects of the mutant kernels. Our results thus demonstrate that ZmSKS13 is a novel regulator that plays a crucial role in kernel development in maize through the modulation of ROS homeostasis.
