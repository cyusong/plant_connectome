The photosynthesis machinery in chloroplast thylakoid membranes is comprised of multiple protein complexes and supercomplexes<sup>1,2</sup>. Here, we show a novel supramolecular organization of photosystem I (PSI) in the moss Physcomitrella patens by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The moss-specific light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein Lhcb9 is involved in this PSI supercomplex, which has been shown to have a molecular density similar to that of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii<sup>3</sup>. Our results show that the structural organization is unexpectedly different-two rows of the LHCI belt exist as in C. reinhardtii<sup>4</sup>, but the outer one is shifted toward the PsaK side. Furthermore, one trimeric LHC protein and one monomeric LHC protein position alongside PsaL/K, filling the gap between these subunits and the outer LHCI belt. We provide evidence showing that Lhcb9 is a key factor, acting as a linkage between the PSI core and the outer LHCI belt to form the unique supramolecular organization of the PSI supercomplex in P. patens.
