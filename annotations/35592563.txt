The <i>far-red-impaired response 1</i> (<i>FAR1</i>) transcription family were initially identified as important factors for phytochrome A (phyA)-mediated far-red light signaling in <i>Arabidopsis</i>; they play crucial roles in controlling the growth and development of plants. The reported reference genome sequences of <i>Arachis</i>, including <i>A. duranensis</i>, <i>A. ipaensis</i>, <i>A. monticola</i>, and <i>A. hypogaea</i>, and its related species <i>Glycine max</i> provide an opportunity to systematically perform a genome-wide identification of <i>FAR1</i> homologous genes and investigate expression patterns of these members in peanut species. Here, a total of 650 <i>FAR1</i> genes were identified from four <i>Aarchis</i> and its closely related species <i>G. max</i>. Of the studied species, <i>A. hypogaea</i> contained the most (246) <i>AhFAR1</i> genes, which can be classified into three subgroups based on phylogenic relationships. The synonymous (<i>Ks</i>) and non-synonymous (<i>Ka</i>) substitution rates, phylogenetic relationship and synteny analysis of the <i>FAR1</i> family provided deep insight into polyploidization, evolution and domestication of peanut <i>AhFAR1</i> genes. The transcriptome data showed that the <i>AhFAR1</i> genes exhibited distinct tissue- and stage-specific expression patterns in peanut. Three candidate genes including <i>Ahy_A10g049543</i>, <i>Ahy_A06g026579</i>, and <i>Ahy_A10g048401</i>, specifically expressed in peg and pod, might participate in pod development in the peanut. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses confirmed that the three selected genes were highly and specifically expressed in the peg and pod. This study systematically analyzed gene structure, evolutionary characteristics and expression patterns of <i>FAR1</i> gene family, which will provide a foundation for the study of genetic and biological function in the future.
