The so-called afterglow, AG, thermoluminescence (TL) band is a useful indicator of the presence of cyclic electron flow (CEF), which is mediated by the NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex in higher plants. Although NDH-dependent CEF occurs also in cyanobacteria, the AG band has previously not been found in these organisms. In the present study, we tested various experimental conditions and could identify a TL component with ca. +40°C peak temperature in Synechocystis PCC 6803 cells, which were illuminated by far-red (FR) light at around -10°C. The +40°C band could be observed when WT cells were grown under ambient air level CO<sub>2</sub> , but was absent in the M55 mutant, which is deficient in the NDH-1 complex. These experimental observations match the characteristics of the AG band of higher plants. Therefore, we conclude that the newly identified +40°C TL component in Synechocystis PCC 6803 is the cyanobacterial counterpart of the plant AG band and originates from NDH-1-mediated CEF. The cyanobacterial AG band was most efficiently induced when FR illumination was applied at -10°C and its contribution to the total TL intensity declined when cells were illuminated above and below this temperature. Based on this phenomenon we also conclude that CEF is blocked by low temperatures at two different sites in Synechocystis PCC 6803: (1) Below -10°C at the level of NDH-1 and (2) below -30°C at the donor or acceptor side of Photosystem I.
