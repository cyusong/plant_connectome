Premature plant senescence induced by abiotic stresses is a major cause of agricultural losses worldwide. Tools for suppressing stress-induced plant senescence are limited. Here, we report that diacetyl, a natural compound emitted by the plant-beneficial bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, suppresses abscisic acid -mediated foliar senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana under various abiotic stress conditions. Our results establish diacetyl as an effective protector against stress-induced plant senescence and reveal a molecular mechanism for bacteria-enhanced plant stress resistance.
