['23043051', 'We surveyed the iron nutrition-responsive transcriptome of Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii using RNA-Seq methodology. Presumed primary targets were identified  in comparisons between visually asymptomatic iron-deficient versus iron-replete  cells. This includes the known components of high-affinity iron uptake as well as  candidates for distributive iron transport in C. reinhardtii. Comparison of  growth-inhibited iron-limited versus iron-replete cells revealed changes in the  expression of genes in chloroplastic oxidative stress response pathways, among  hundreds of other genes. The output from the transcriptome was validated at  multiple levels: by quantitative RT-PCR for assessing the data analysis pipeline,  by quantitative proteomics for assessing the impact of changes in RNA abundance  on the proteome, and by cross-species comparison for identifying conserved or  universal response pathways. In addition, we assessed the functional importance  of three target genes, Vitamin C 2 (VTC2), monodehydroascorbate reductase 1  (MDAR1), and conserved in the green lineage and diatoms 27 (CGLD27), by  biochemistry or reverse genetics. VTC2 and MDAR1, which are key enzymes in de  novo ascorbate synthesis and ascorbate recycling, respectively, are likely  responsible for the 10-fold increase in ascorbate content of iron-limited cells.  CGLD27/At5g67370 is a highly conserved, presumed chloroplast-localized pioneer  protein and is important for growth of Arabidopsis thaliana in low iron.', '2012 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.102491', 'Merchant']
