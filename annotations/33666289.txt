The floral nectary, first recognized and described by Carl Linnaeus, is a remarkable organ that serves to provide carbohydrate-rich nectar to visiting pollinators in return for gamete transfer between flowers. Therefore, the nectary has indispensable biological significance in plant reproduction and even in evolution. Only two genes, CRC and STY, have been reported to regulate floral nectary development. However, it is still unknown what genes contribute to extrafloral nectary development. Here, we report that a nectary development gene in Gossypium (GoNe), annotated as an APETALA 2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF), is responsible for the formation of both floral and extrafloral nectaries. GoNe plants that are silenced via virus-induced gene silencing technology and/or knocked out by Cas9 produce a nectariless phenotype. Point mutation and gene truncation simultaneously in duplicated genes Ne<sub>1</sub> Ne<sub>2</sub> lead to impaired nectary development in tetraploid cotton. There is no difference in the expression of the CRC and STY genes between the nectary TM-1 and the nectariless MD90ne in cotton. Therefore, the GoNe gene responsible for the formation of floral and extrafloral nectaries may be independent of CRC and STY. A complex mechanism might exist that restricts the nectary to a specific position with different genetic factors. Characterization of these target genes regulating nectary production has provided insights into the development, evolution, and function of nectaries and insect-resistant breeding.
