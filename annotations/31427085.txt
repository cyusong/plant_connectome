['31427085', 'Cys(2)/His(2) zinc-finger protein (C2H2-ZFP) is widely involved in the  reproductive development of plants, but its role in pollen development is still  elusive. Here, we identified a pollen-related C2H2-ZFP gene named as MALE  FERTILITY-ASSOCIATED ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 1 (MAZ1), which was first isolated from  Arabidopsis thaliana. MAZ1 showed a preferential expression pattern in early  anther development. Its mutation resulted in aberrant primexine deposition at the  tetrad stage, followed by a defective multiple-layer pattern of exine with  irregular baculum and no tectum. Furthermore, microspore development was  arrested, and no intine layer was formed. These developmental defects led to  fertility reduction and pollen abortion. This study reveals the essential role of  MAZ1 in pollen wall development.', '2019 Oct 15', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.08.050', 'Cao']
