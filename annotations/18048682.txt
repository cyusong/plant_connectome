['18048682', 'Reduced crop productivity due to soils containing toxic levels of boron (B) is a  worldwide problem in food production. It is estimated that up to 17% of the  barley yield losses in southern Australia are caused by B toxicity. We found that  the expression of AtBOR4, an Arabidopsis paralog of BOR1, the first identified  boron transporter gene, generates plants that are tolerant of high B levels. BOR4  is a polarly localized borate exporter that enhances B efflux from roots. The  present study is a foundation for the improvement of crop productivity in soils  containing excess B, which are distributed in arid areas of the world.', '2007 Nov 30', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1146634', 'Fujiwara']
