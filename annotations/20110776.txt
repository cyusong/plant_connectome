The plant cell wall is a complex polysaccharide network and performs important developmental and physiological functions far beyond supplying the physical constrains. Plant cells have the ability to react to cell wall defects as exhibited by changes in gene expression, accumulation of ectopic lignin, stress responses and growth arrest. It is a major challenge to understand how plants sense and respond to wall integrity since very little is known about the signaling involved in the responses. Cellulose synthase-like D (CSLD) proteins mediating the biosynthesis of a wall polysaccharide polymer make up a common subfamily to all plants. Recently, we have reported the functional characterization of <i>CSLD4</i> in rice. Mutations in <i>OsCSLD4</i> show morphological alterations and pleiotropic effects on wall compositions and structure. Our study demonstrates that <i>OsCSLD4</i> play a critical role in cell wall formation and plant growth. Here we show the subtle wall alterations by separating the culm residues into five fractions. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis further revealed that the expression of various genes involved in xylan synthesis and cell cycle regulation was altered in mutant plants, as the responses to <i>OsCSLD4</i> disruption. Therefore, plants may have fine sensory machinery to react to wall defects and modulate growth for adapting to the changes.
