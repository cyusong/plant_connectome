Light and temperature are two key environmental factors that coordinately regulate plant growth and development. Although the mechanisms that integrate signaling mediated by cold and red light have been unraveled, the roles of the blue light photoreceptors cryptochromes in plant responses to cold remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the CRYPTOCHROME2 (CRY2)-COP1-HY5-BBX7/8 module regulates blue light-dependent cold acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that phosphorylated forms of CRY2 induced by blue light are stabilized by cold stress and that cold-stabilized CRY2 competes with the transcription factor HY5 to attenuate the HY5-COP1 interaction, thereby allowing HY5 to accumulate at cold temperatures. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that B-BOX DOMAIN PROTEIN7 (BBX7) and BBX8 function as direct HY5 targets that positively regulate freezing tolerance by modulating the expression of a set of cold-responsive genes, which mainly occurs independently of the C-repeat-binding factor pathway. Our study uncovers a mechanistic framework by which CRY2-mediated blue-light signaling enhances freezing tolerance, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between cold and light signaling pathways in plants.
