The genus <i>Brachypodium</i> represents a model system that is advancing our knowledge of the biology of grasses, including small grains, in the postgenomics era. The most widely used species, <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, is a C<sub>3</sub> plant that is distributed worldwide. <i>B. distachyon</i> has a small genome, short life cycle, and small stature and is amenable to genetic transformation. Due to the intensive and thoughtful development of this grass as a model organism, it is well-suited for laboratory and field experimentation. The intent of this review is to introduce this model system genus and describe some key outcomes of nearly a decade of research since the first draft genome sequence of the flagship species, <i>B. distachyon</i>, was completed. We discuss characteristics and features of <i>B. distachyon</i> and its congeners that make the genus a valuable model system for studies in ecology, evolution, genetics, and genomics in the grasses, review current hot topics in <i>Brachypodium</i> research, and highlight the potential for future analysis using this system in the coming years.
