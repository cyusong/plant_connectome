['22427344', 'The flowering time of plants is affected by modest changes in ambient  temperature. However, little is known about the regulation of ambient  temperature-responsive flowering by small RNAs. In this study, we show that the  microRNA156 (miR156)-SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE3 (SPL3) module  directly regulates FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) expression in the leaf to control  ambient temperature-responsive flowering. Overexpression of miR156 led to more  delayed flowering at a lower ambient temperature (16 degrees C), which was associated  with down-regulation of FT and FRUITFULL expression. Among miR156 target genes,  SPL3 mRNA levels were mainly reduced, probably because miR156-mediated cleavage  of SPL3 mRNA was higher at 16 degrees C. Overexpression of miR156-resistant SPL3  [SPL3(-)] caused early flowering, regardless of the ambient temperature, which  was associated with up-regulation of FT and FRUITFULL expression. Reduction of  miR156 activity by target mimicry led to a phenotype similar to that of  SUC2::rSPL3 plants. FT up-regulation was observed after dexamethasone treatment  in GVG-rSPL3 plants. Misexpression and artificial microRNA-mediated suppression  of FT in the leaf dramatically altered the ambient temperature-responsive  flowering of plants overexpressing miR156 and SPL3(-). Chromatin  immunoprecipitation assay showed that the SPL3 protein directly binds to GTAC  motifs within the FT promoter. Lesions in TERMINAL FLOWER1, SHORT VEGETATIVE  PHASE, and EARLY FLOWERING3 did not alter the expression of miR156 and SPL3.  Taken together, our data suggest that the interaction between the miR156-SPL3  module and FT is part of the regulatory mechanism controlling flowering time in  response to ambient temperature.', '2012 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.192369', 'Ahn']
