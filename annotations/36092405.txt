Stone cells are sclerenchyma cells formed by deposition of lignin, which is the most significant factor limiting the quality of pears. Ca<sup>2+</sup> was known to inhibit stone cells in pear fruits, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Our study revealed that exogenous CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) treatment of "Nanguo" pear (<i>Pyrus ussuriensis</i>) suppressed the synthesis of lignin and stone cell production. We further analysed the transcriptomes using RNA-seq, identified a transcription factor, <i>PuDof2.5</i>, and its targets gene <i>PuPRX42-like</i> (lignin polymerase gene) expression decreased in CaCl<sub>2</sub>-treated samples, which are involved in suppressing lignin biosynthesis in pear fruit. <i>PuDof2.5</i> was found to bind directly to the <i>PuPRX42-like</i> promoter and induced its transcription. Taken together, our results revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> modulated the key lignin biosynthetic transcription factor <i>PuDof2.5</i> to suppress stone cell production in pear fruits.
