['8392411', 'The development of heterologous transposon tagging systems has been an important  objective for many laboratories. Here, we demonstrate the use of a Dissociation  (Ds) derivative of the maize transposable element Activator (Ac) to tag the DRL1  locus of Arabidopsis. The drl1 mutant shows highly abnormal development with  stunted roots, few root hairs, lanceolate leaves, and a highly enlarged,  disorganized shoot apex that does not produce an inflorescence. The mutation was  shown to be tightly linked to a transposed Ds, and somatic instability was  observed in the presence of the transposase source. Some plants showing somatic  reversion flowered and produced large numbers of wild-type progeny. These  revertant progeny always inherited a DRL1 allele from which Ds had excised.  Analysis of the changes in DNA sequence induced by the insertion and excision of  the Ds element showed that they were typical of those induced by Ac and Ds in  maize.', '1993 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.5.6.631', 'Dean']
