['18208522', 'Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play key regulatory roles in diverse cellular  functions, including cell-cycle progression, transcription and translation. In  plants, CDKs have been classified into several groups, named A through to G, but  the functions of most are poorly characterized. CDKCs are known to phosphorylate  the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), and therefore the  CDKC-cyclinT (CycT) complex may have a role similar to the animal CDK9-CycT  complex of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). However, we  found that the predicted structure of the Arabidopsis CDKC2 protein is more  similar to the mammalian cdc2-related kinase, CRK7, than to CDK9. CRK7 is  proposed to link transcription with splicing, and CDKC2 contains all the  structural features of CRK7 that make the latter distinct from CDK9. Consistent  with this, we show that GFP-CDKC2 fusion proteins co-localize with spliceosomal  components, that the expression of CDKC2 modifies the location of these  components, and that co-localization was dependent on the transcriptional status  of the cells and on CDKC2-kinase activity. We propose, therefore, that the  Arabidopsis CDKC2 combines the functions of both CRK7 and CDK9, and could also  couple splicing with transcription.', '2008 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03414.x', 'Doonan']
