Both glucose and ABA play crucial roles in the regulation of seed germination and post-germination development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, up-regulation of ABA biosynthesis is suggested as one of the possible mechanisms mediating the glucose-induced delay in seed germination. Since the endogenous ABA level is controlled by the equilibrium between ABA biosynthesis and catabolism, we investigated how this equilibrium is related to the regulation of seed germination by glucose in rice. When ABA biosynthesis was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of the ABA anabolic enzyme 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), rice seed germination showed no response. In contrast, inhibition of ABA catabolism by diniconazole significantly arrested seed germination, suggesting that the regulation of ABA catabolism plays a major role. Further experiments indicated that the expression of OsABA8ox3, a key gene in ABA catabolism and encoding ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice, was significantly increased during the first 6 h of imbibition, which was consistent with the decline of ABA content in the imbibed seeds. Expression of OsABA8ox genes, especially OsABA8ox2 and OsABA8ox3, was sensitively suppressed in the presence of exogenously supplied glucose. In contrast, the expression profiles of OsNCED genes that control the limiting step of ABA biosynthesis showed no significant changes in response to low levels of glucose. Our results demonstrated that the glucose-induced delay of seed germination is a result of the suppression of ABA catabolism rather than any enhancement of ABA biosynthesis during rice seed germination.
