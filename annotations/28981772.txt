Only a few transcription factors have been described in the regulation of the strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) fruit ripening process. Using a transcriptomic approach, we identified and functionally characterized FaDOF2, a DOF-type ripening-related transcription factor, which is hormonally regulated and specific to the receptacle, though high expression levels were also found in petals. The expression pattern of FaDOF2 correlated with eugenol content, a phenylpropanoid volatile, in both fruit receptacles and petals. When FaDOF2 expression was silenced in ripe strawberry receptacles, the expression of FaEOBII and FaEGS2, two key genes involved in eugenol production, were down-regulated. These fruits showed a concomitant decrease in eugenol content, which confirmed that FaDOF2 is a transcription factor that is involved in eugenol production in ripe fruit receptacles. By using the yeast two-hybrid system and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, we demonstrated that FaDOF2 interacts with FaEOBII, a previously reported regulator of eugenol production, which determines fine-tuning of the expression of key genes that are involved in eugenol production. These results provide evidence that FaDOF2 plays a subsidiary regulatory role with FaEOBII in the expression of genes encoding enzymes that control eugenol production. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the regulation of the volatile phenylpropanoid pathway in ripe strawberry receptacles.
