Lipid rafts in plasma membranes are hypothesized to play key roles in many cellular processes including signal transduction, membrane trafficking and entry of pathogens. We recently documented the biochemical characterization of lipid rafts, isolated as detergent-insoluble membranes, from Medicago truncatula root plasma membranes. We evidenced that the plant-specific lipid steryl-conjugates are among the main lipids of rafts together with free sterols and sphingolipids. An extensive proteomic analysis showed the presence of a specific set of proteins common to other lipid rafts, plus the presence of a redox system around a cytochrome b(561) not previously identified in lipid rafts of either plants or animals. Here, we discuss the similarities and differences between the lipids and proteins of plant and animal lipid rafts. Moreover we describe the potential biochemical functioning of the M. truncatula root lipid raft redox proteins and question whether they may play a physiological role in legume-symbiont interactions.
