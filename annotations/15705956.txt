['15705956', 'The WRKY proteins comprise a major family of transcription factors that are  essential in pathogen and salicylic acid responses of higher plants as well as a  variety of plant-specific reactions. They share a DNA binding domain, designated  as the WRKY domain, which contains an invariant WRKYGQK sequence and a  CX4-5CX22-23HXH zinc binding motif. Herein, we report the NMR solution structure  of the C-terminal WRKY domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY4 protein. The  structure consists of a four-stranded beta-sheet, with a zinc binding pocket  formed by the conserved Cys/His residues located at one end of the beta-sheet,  revealing a novel zinc and DNA binding structure. The WRKYGQK residues correspond  to the most N-terminal beta-strand, kinked in the middle of the sequence by the  Gly residue, which enables extensive hydrophobic interactions involving the Trp  residue and contributes to the structural stability of the beta-sheet. Based on a  profile of NMR chemical shift perturbations, we propose that the same strand  enters the DNA groove and forms contacts with the DNA bases.', '2005 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.026435', 'Yokoyama']
