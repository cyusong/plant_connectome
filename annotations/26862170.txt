['26862170', 'Eukaryotic cells require mechanisms to establish the proportion of cellular  volume devoted to particular organelles. These mechanisms are poorly understood.  From a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana,  we cloned a mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function  that is homologous to two other Arabidopsis genes of unknown function and to  FRIENDLY, which was previously shown to promote the normal distribution of  mitochondria in Arabidopsis. In contrast to FRIENDLY, these three homologs of  FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we  proposed that FRIENDLY expanded into a small gene family to help regulate the  energy metabolism of cells that contain both mitochondria and chloroplasts.  Indeed, we found that knocking out these genes caused a number of chloroplast  phenotypes, including a reduction in the proportion of cellular volume devoted to  chloroplasts to 50% of wild type. Thus, we refer to these genes as REDUCED  CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE (REC). The size of the chloroplast compartment was reduced  most in rec1 mutants. The REC1 protein accumulated in the cytosol and the  nucleus. REC1 was excluded from the nucleus when plants were treated with  amitrole, which inhibits cell expansion and chloroplast function. We conclude  that REC1 is an extraplastidic protein that helps to establish the size of the  chloroplast compartment, and that signals derived from cell expansion or  chloroplasts may regulate REC1.', '2016 Feb 23', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1515741113', 'Osteryoung']
