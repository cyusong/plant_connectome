Intracellular vesicular trafficking ensures the exchange of lipids and proteins between the membranous compartments. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) play a central role in membrane fusion and they are key factors for vesicular trafficking in plants, including crops economically important such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Taking advantage of the complete genome sequence available of S. lycopersicum, we identified 63 genes that encode putative SNARE proteins. Then, phylogenetic analysis allowed the classification of SNAREs in five main groups and recognizing their possible functions. A structure analysis of the genes, their syntenic relationships and their location in the chromosomes were also carried out for their characterization. In addition, the expression profiles of SNARE genes in different tissues were investigated using microarray-based analysis. The results indicated that specific SNAREs had a higher induction in leaf, root, flower and mature green fruit. S. lycopersicum is characterized for being a crop sensitive to saline stress unlike its wild relatives, such as Solanum pennellii, Solanum pimpinellifolium, Solanum habrochaites or Solanum chilense, which are tolerant. In this context, we analyzed different microarrays and evaluated and validated the transcript levels through qRT-PCR experiments. The results showed that SlGOS12.2, SlVAMP727 and SlSYP51.2 could have a positive relationship with salt stress and probably an important role in their tolerance. All these data increase our knowledge and can also be utilized to identify potential molecular targets for conferring tolerance to various stresses in tomato.
