Low temperature is one of the abiotic stressors that affect growth and productivity of rice. The plant hormone gibberellin not only regulates growth and development but is also involved in stress defense. Our rice seedling experiments demonstrated that overexpression of SLR1, a gene that encodes the rice DELLA protein, enhanced chilling tolerance. In contrast, overexpression of the active GA synthesis gene OsGA20ox1 reduced chilling tolerance, indicating that weakening GA signaling promoted plant defense against cold stress. CoIP-MS and BiFC assays showed that SLR1 physically interacted with OsGRF6. After cold treatment and recovery, the survival rates of OsGRF6-overexpression lines and an osgrf6 mutant and its complementary lines indicated that OsGRF6 is a negative regulator of chilling tolerance in rice. The yeast one-hybrid, qRT-PCR, and transactivation assays showed that both SLR1 and OsGRF6 can bind to the promoter of the active GA catabolic gene OsGA2ox1, where SLR1 promoted and OsGRF6 suppressed OsGA2ox1 expression. At normal temperature, OsGRF6 was responsible for maintaining active GA levels by inhibiting OsGA2ox1. When rice seedlings were subjected to chilling stress, the repressive effect of OsGRF6 on OsGA2ox1 was released by cold-induced SLR1, which activated OsGA2ox1 expression to decrease the active GA levels, enhancing chilling tolerance. These results suggest that OsGRF6 is an important regulator in the balance between growth and chilling tolerance in rice.
