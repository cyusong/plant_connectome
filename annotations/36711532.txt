['36711532', 'MOM1 is an Arabidopsis factor previously shown to mediate transcriptional  silencing independent of major DNA methylation changes. Here we found that MOM1  localizes with sites of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Tethering MOM1 with  artificial zinc finger to unmethylated FWA promoter led to establishment of DNA  methylation and FWA silencing. This process was blocked by mutations in  components of the Pol V arm of the RdDM machinery, as well as by mutation of  MORC6 . We found that at some endogenous RdDM sites, MOM1 is required to maintain  DNA methylation and a closed chromatin state. In addition, efficient silencing of  newly introduced FWA transgenes was impaired by mutation of MOM1 or mutation of  genes encoding the MOM1 interacting PIAL1/2 proteins. In addition to RdDM sites,  we identified a group of MOM1 peaks at active chromatin near genes that  colocalized with MORC6. These findings demonstrate a multifaceted role of MOM1 in  genome regulation.', '2023 Jan 10', 'bioRxiv', '10.1101/2023.01.10.523455', 'Jacobsen']
