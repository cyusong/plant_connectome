Two recent publications suggest that VPD drives stomatal conductance independent of ABA and that hydropassive and active stomatal movements are interlocked within a single, mechanistic framework.

VPD: !drives! stomatal conductance 
ABA: !independent of! VPD 
hydropassive: !interlocked with! active stomatal movements 
mechanistic framework: !contains! hydropassive and active stomatal movements
