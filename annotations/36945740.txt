The utilization of stabilized DELLA proteins Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b was crucial for increasing wheat (Triticum aestivum) productivity during the Green Revolution. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. Here, we cloned a gain-of-function allele of the GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase encoding gene GSK3 by characterizing a dwarf wheat mutant. Furthermore, we determined that GSK3 interacts with and phosphorylates the Green Revolution protein Rht-B1b to promote it to reduce plant height in wheat. Specifically, phosphorylation by GSK3 may enhance the activity and stability of Rht-B1b, allowing it to inhibit the activities of its target transcription factors. Taken together, we reveal a positive regulaory mechanism for the Green Revolution protein Rht-B1b by GSK3, which might have contributed to the Green Revolution in wheat.
