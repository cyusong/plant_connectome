Cold stress is a major factor limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide, especially at the seedling and booting stages. The identification of genes associated with cold tolerance (CT) in rice is important for sustainable food production. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study to identify the genetic loci associated with CT by using a 1,033-accession diversity panel. We identified five CT-related genetic loci at the booting stage. Accessions carrying multiple cold-tolerant alleles displayed a higher seed-setting rate than did accessions that had no cold-tolerant alleles or carried a single allele. At the seedling stage, eight genetic loci related to CT have been identified. Among these, <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> was identified as the candidate gene for the <i>qPSR10</i> genetic locus that is associated with CT in rice seedlings. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP2<sup>G</sup>, at position 343 in <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> is responsible for conferring CT at the seedling stage in rice. Further analysis of the haplotype network revealed that SNP2<sup>G</sup> was present in 80.08% of the temperate <i>japonica</i> accessions but only 3.8% of the <i>indica</i> ones. We used marker-assisted selection to construct a series of BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>3</sub> near-isogenic lines possessing the cold-tolerant allele SNP2<sup>G</sup> When subjected to cold stress, plants carrying SNP2<sup>G</sup> survived better as seedlings and showed higher grain weight than plants carrying the SNP2<sup>A</sup> allele. The CT-related loci identified here and the functional verification of <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> will provide genetic resources for breeding cold-tolerant varieties and for studying the molecular basis of CT in rice.
