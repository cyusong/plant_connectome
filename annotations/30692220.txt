DNA methylation plays an important role in diverse developmental processes in many eukaryotes, including the response to environmental stress. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone that is up-regulated under stress. The involvement of DNA methylation in the ABA response has been reported but is poorly understood. DNA demethylation is a reverse process of DNA methylation and often induces structural changes of chromatin leading to transcriptional activation. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana)</i>, active DNA demethylation depends on the activity of REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1), which directly excises 5-methylcytosine from DNA. Here we showed that <i>ros1</i> mutants were hypersensitive to ABA during early seedling development and root elongation. Expression levels of some ABA-inducible genes were decreased in <i>ros1</i> mutants, and more than 60% of their proximal regions became hypermethylated, indicating that a subset of ABA-inducible genes are under the regulation of ROS1-dependent DNA demethylation. Notable among them is <i>NICOTINAMIDASE 3</i> (<i>NIC3</i>) that encodes an enzyme that converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway. Many enzymes in this pathway are known to be involved in stress responses. The <i>nic3</i> mutants display hypersensitivity to ABA, whereas overexpression of <i>NIC3</i> restores normal ABA responses. Our data suggest that <i>NIC3</i> is responsive to ABA but requires ROS1-mediated DNA demethylation at the promoter as a prerequisite to transcriptional activation. These findings suggest that ROS1-induced active DNA demethylation maintains the active state of <i>NIC3</i> transcription in response to ABA.
