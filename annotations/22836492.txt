Higher plants adapt to phosphorus deficiency through a complex of biological processes. Among of them, two adaptive processes are very important for the response of higher plants to phosphorus deficiency. One is the enhancement of root growth by regulating carbohydrate metabolism and allocation, and the other is rhizosphere acidification to acquire phosphorus efficiently from soil. TFT6 and TFT7, two different members of tomato 14-3-3 gene family, play the distinct roles in the adaption of plants to phosphorus deficiency by taking part in the two processes respectively. TFT6 which acts mainly in leaves is involved in the systemic response to phosphorus deficiency by regulating leaf carbon allocation and increasing phloem sucrose transport to promote root growth, while TFT7 directly functions in root by activating root plasma membrane H (+) -ATPase to release more protons under phosphorus deficiency. Based on these results, we propose that 14-3-3 proteins play the smart role in response to phosphorus deficiency in higher plants.
