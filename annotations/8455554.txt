['8455554', 'We have examined the late-flowering behavior of two ecotypes of Arabidopsis  thaliana, Sf-2 and Le-0. The late-flowering trait segregates as a single dominant  gene in crosses with the early-flowering Columbia ecotype. This gene, which we  refer to as FLA, is located at one end of chromosome 4 between RFLP markers 506  and 3843 and is thus distinct from previously mapped genes that affect flowering  time. The extreme delay in flowering time caused by the FLA gene can be overcome  by vernalization in both the ecotypes in which it occurs naturally and in the  Columbia ecotype into which this gene has been introgressed.', '1993 Feb', 'Mol Gen Genet', '10.1007/BF00282798', 'Amasino']
