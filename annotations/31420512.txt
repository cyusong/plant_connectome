Organic waste, an inevitable byproduct of metabolism, increases in amount as metabolic rates (per capita power) of animals and plants rise. Most of it is recycled within aerobic ecosystems, but some is lost to the system and is sequestered in the crust for millions of years. Here, I identify and resolve a previously overlooked paradox concerning the long-term loss of organic matter. In this efficiency paradox, high-powered species are inefficient in that they release copious waste, but the ecosystems they inhabit lose almost no organic matter. Systems occupied by more efficient low-powered species suffer greater losses because of less efficient recycling. Over Phanerozoic time, ecosystems have become more productive and increasingly efficient at retaining and redistributing organic matter even as opportunistic and highly competitive producers and consumers gained power and became less efficient. These patterns and trends are driven by natural selection at the level of individuals and coherent groups, which favors winners that are more powerful, active, and wasteful. The activities of these competitors collectively create conditions that are increasingly conducive to more efficient recycling and retention of organic matter in the ecosystem.

Metabolic rate: !increases! Organic waste
Ecosystems: !retain! Organic matter
Natural selection: !favors! Winners
Competitors: !create conditions! Efficient recycling
