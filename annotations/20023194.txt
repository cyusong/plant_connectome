['20023194', 'Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are highly conserved transcription factors  critical for cell proliferation and differentiation. Recent studies have  implicated bHLH proteins in many plant signaling processes, including  brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Here, we report identification of two families of  atypical bHLH proteins capable of modulating BR signaling. We found that  activation-tagged bri1 suppressor 1-Dominant (atbs1-D), previously identified as  a dominant suppressor of a weak BR receptor mutant bri1-301, was caused by  overexpression of a 93-amino acid atypical bHLH protein lacking amino acids  critical for DNA binding. Interestingly, atbs1-D only suppresses weak BR mutants,  while overexpression of a truncated ATBS1 lacking the basic motif also rescues  bri1-301, suggesting that ATBS1 likely stimulates BR signaling by sequestering  negative BR signaling components. A yeast two-hybrid screen using ATBS1 as bait  discovered four ATBS1-Interacting Factors (AIFs) that are members of another  atypical bHLH protein subfamily. AIF1 exhibits an overlapping expression pattern  with ATBS1 and its homologs and interacts with ATBS1 in vitro and in vivo. AIF1  overexpression nullifies the suppressive effect of atbs1-D on bri1-301 and  results in dwarf transgenic plants resembling BR mutants. By contrast, silencing  of AIF1 partially suppressed the bri1-301 phenotype. Our results suggested that  plants use these atypical bHLH proteins to regulate BR signaling.', '2009 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.072504', 'Li']
