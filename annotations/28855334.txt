Root growth is modulated by environmental factors and depends on cell production in the root meristem (RM). New cells in the meristem are generated by stem cells and transit-amplifying cells, which together determine RM cell number. Transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling factors have been implicated in regulating the switch from stem cells to transit-amplifying cells. Here, we show that two <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> paralogs encoding plant-specific histone deacetylases, HDT1 and HDT2, regulate a second switch from transit-amplifying cells to expanding cells. Knockdown of <i>HDT1/2</i> (<i>hdt1,2i</i>) results in an earlier switch and causes a reduced RM cell number. Our data show that HDT1/2 negatively regulate the acetylation level of the <i>C<sub>19</sub>-GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE2</i> (<i>GA2ox2</i>) locus and repress the expression of <i>GA2ox2</i> in the RM and elongation zone. Overexpression of <i>GA2ox2</i> in the RM phenocopies the <i>hdt1,2i</i> phenotype. Conversely, knockout of <i>GA2ox2</i> partially rescues the root growth defect of <i>hdt1,2i</i> These results suggest that by repressing the expression of <i>GA2ox2</i>, HDT1/2 likely fine-tune gibberellin metabolism and they are crucial for regulating the switch from cell division to expansion to determine RM cell number. We propose that HDT1/2 function as part of a mechanism that modulates root growth in response to environmental factors.
