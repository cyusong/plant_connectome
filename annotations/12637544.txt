['12637544', '12-Hydroxyjasmonate, also known as tuberonic acid, was first isolated from  Solanum tuberosum and was shown to have tuber-inducing properties. It is derived  from the ubiquitously occurring jasmonic acid, an important signaling molecule  mediating diverse developmental processes and plant defense responses. We report  here that the gene AtST2a from Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a hydroxyjasmonate  sulfotransferase. The recombinant AtST2a protein was found to exhibit strict  specificity for 11- and 12-hydroxyjasmonate with K(m) values of 50 and 10 microm,  respectively. Furthermore, 12-hydroxyjasmonate and its sulfonated derivative are  shown to be naturally occurring in A. thaliana. The exogenous application of  methyljasmonate to A. thaliana plants led to increased levels of both  metabolites, whereas treatment with 12-hydroxyjasmonate led to increased level of  12-hydroxyjasmonate sulfate without affecting the endogenous level of jasmonic  acid. AtST2a expression was found to be induced following treatment with  methyljasmonate and 12-hydroxyjasmonate. In contrast, the expression of the  methyljasmonate-responsive gene Thi2.1, a marker gene in plant defense responses,  is not induced upon treatment with 12-hydroxyjasmonate indicating the existence  of independent signaling pathways responding to jasmonic acid and  12-hydroxyjasmonic acid. Taken together, the results suggest that the  hydroxylation and sulfonation reactions might be components of a pathway that  inactivates excess jasmonic acid in plants. Alternatively, the function of AtST2a  might be to control the biological activity of 12-hydroxyjasmonic acid.', '2003 May 16', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M211943200', 'Varin']
