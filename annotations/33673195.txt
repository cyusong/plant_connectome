Different types of anxiety disorders have become the number one mental health issue in developed countries. The search for new, safer and effective drug-like molecules among naturally derived substances faces two difficulties: an efficient method of isolation compounds with a high-purity and high-throughput animal model for activity assay. Thus, the aim of the present study was to isolate by liquid-liquid chromatography high-purity rare coumarins from the fruits of <i>Seseli devenyense</i> Simonk. and evaluate their anxiolytic effect (defined as reversed thimotaxis) using a 5-days post-fertilization (dpf) <i>Danio rerio</i> larvae model. Liquid-liquid chromatography enabled the isolation of one simple hydroxycoumarin (devenyol) and four pyranocoumarins (cis-khellactone, d-laserpitin, isolaserpitin and octanoyllomatin). The anxiolytic effect was defined as a decrease in the time spent in the boundaries of the living space (also described as reversed thigmotaxis). Our results show that all isolated courmarins exerted a significant influence on the anxiety behavior (anxiolytic activity) in the zebrafish larvae model. According to our knowledge, this is the first report of anxiolytic activity of pyranocoumarins and devenyol.
