['21597164', "Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (ENGase) is involved in the production of  high-mannose type free N-glycans during plant development and fruit maturation.  In a previous study (K. Nakamura et al. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 73, 461-464  (2009)), we identified the tomato ENGase gene and found that gene expression  remained relatively constant. In the present study, we constructed an Arabidopsis  thaliana mutant in which the expression of two putative ENGase genes was  suppressed. The mutant showed no ENGase activity, but produced high-mannose type  free N-glycans carrying the N,N'-acetylchitobiosyl unit that is produced by  peptide:N-glycanase, indicating that both these genes encode Arabidopsis ENGase.", '2011', 'Biosci Biotechnol Biochem', '10.1271/bbb.110148', 'Fujiyama']
