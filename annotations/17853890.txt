Plants and animals have evolved structurally related innate immune sensors inside cells to detect the presence of microbial molecules. An evolutionary ancient folding machinery becomes engaged for the synthesis of autorepressed receptor forms in both kingdoms. The receptors act as regulatory signal transduction switches and are activated upon direct or indirect perception of non-self structures. Recent findings indicate that nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning and nuclear activity is critical for the function of several plant immune sensors, thereby linking receptor function to transcriptional reprogramming of host cells for pathogen defense. This implies short signalling pathways and reveals parallels with regulatory control mechanisms of animal steroid receptors.
