Potassium (K) deficiency is a key limiting factor in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) production. By grafting two contrasting cotton cultivars, CCRI41 (more susceptible to K+ deficiency) and SCRC22 (more tolerant of K+ deficiency), we established that cotton shoot plays a vital role in the regulation of root K+ uptake. To identify the genetic basis of this finding, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of roots of CCRI41 self-grafts (CCRI41/CCRI41, scion/rootstock) and SCRC22/CCRI41 reciprocal-grafts exposed to K+ deficiency. We found that GhHAK5a, an orthologous of Arabidopsis thaliana high-affinity K+ transporter, AtHAK5, was significantly induced in the CCRI41 rootstock by the SCRC22 scion. This gene was mainly expressed in roots and was more highly induced by K+ deficiency in roots of SCRC22 than those of CCRI41. Agrobacterium-mediated virus-induced gene silencing and yeast complementary assay showed that GhHAK5a is a high-affinity K+ uptake transporter. Importantly, silencing of GhHAK5a in the CCRI41 rootstock almost completely inhibited the K+ uptake induced by SCRC22 scion in CCRI41 rootstock. We identified a key high-affinity K+ transporter, GhHAK5a in cotton, which is the essential target for shoot regulation of root K+ uptake under K+ deficiency.
