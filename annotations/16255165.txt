We isolated cDNAs encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH, EC 1.2.1.8) from the salt-tolerant Poaceae, Zoysia tenuifolia by polymerase chain reactions. Zoysia betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ZBD1) is 1892bp long and codes for 507 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of ZBD1 is 88% similar to the sequence of rice BADH. Ten cDNA clones were isolated from a cDNA Library of salt-treated Z. tenuifolia by using the ZBD1 fragment as a probe. The proteins coded in some clones were more homologous to BBD2, the cytosolic BADH of barley, than to ZBD1. To investigate their enzymatic properties, ZBD1 and spinach BADH were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The optimal pH of ZBD1 was 9.5, which was more alkaline than that of spinach BADH. ZBD1 was less tolerant to NaCl than spinach BADH. ZBD1 showed not only BADH activity but also aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The Km values of ZBD1 for betaine aldehyde, 4-aminobutyraldehyde (AB-ald), and 3-aminopropionaldehyde (AP-ald) were 291, 49, and 4.0 microM, respectively. ZBD1 showed higher specific activities for AB-ald and AP-ald than did spinach BADH.
