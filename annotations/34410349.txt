Xylem is a complex tissue that forms the bulk of tree bodies and has several functions, including to conduct water, store water and nutrients, and biomechanically support the plant body. We examined how xylem functional traits varied at different positions within 9-year-old Populus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa. Whole trees were excavated, and xylem samples were collected at 1-m increments along the main root-to-shoot axis of six trees, from root tip to shoot tip. We examined biomechanical and water-storage traits of the xylem, including using a non-invasive imaging technique to examine water content within long, intact branches (high-resolution computed tomography; microCT). Xylem density, strength, and stiffness were greater in shoots than roots. Along the main root-to-shoot axis, xylem strength and stiffness were greatest at shoot tips, and the tissue became linearly weaker and less stiff down the plant and through the root. Roots had greater water storage with lower biomechanical support, and shoots had biomechanically stronger and stiffer xylem with lower water storage. These findings support trade-offs among xylem functions between roots and shoots. Understanding how xylem functions differ throughout tree bodies is important in understanding whole-tree functioning and how terrestrial plants endure numerous environmental challenges over decades of growth.
