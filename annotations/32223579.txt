The family Sclerotiniaceae includes important phytopathogens, such as <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>, that activate plant immune responses to facilitate infection propagation. The mechanisms of plant resistance to these necrotrophic pathogens are still poorly understood. To discover mechanisms of resistance, we used the <i>Ciborinia camelliae</i> (Sclerotiniaceae)-<i>Camellia</i> spp. pathosystem. This fungus induces rapid infection of the blooms of susceptible cultivar Nicky Crisp (<i>Camellia japonica</i> × <i>Camellia pitardii</i> var. <i>pitardii</i>), while <i>Camellia lutchuensis</i> is highly resistant. Genome-wide analysis of gene expression in resistant plants revealed fast modulation of host transcriptional activity 6 h after ascospore inoculation. Ascospores induced the same defense pathways in the susceptible <i>Camellia</i> cultivar but much delayed and coinciding with disease development. We next tested the hypothesis that differences in defense timing influences disease outcome. We induced early defense in the susceptible cultivar using methyl jasmonate and this strongly reduced disease development. Conversely, delaying the response in the resistant species, by infecting it with actively growing fungal mycelium, increased susceptibility. The same plant defense pathways, therefore, contribute to both resistance and susceptibility, suggesting that defense timing is a critical factor in plant health, and resistance against necrotrophic pathogens may occur during the initial biotrophy-like stages.
