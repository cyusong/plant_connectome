Aldehyde dehydrogenases metabolise a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, which become cytotoxic at high levels. Family 7 aldehyde dehydrogenase genes, often described as antiquitins or turgor-responsive genes in plants, are broadly conserved across all domains. Despite the high conservation of the plant ALDH7 proteins and their importance in stress responses, their regulation has not been investigated. Here, we compared ALDH7 genes of different Brassicaceae and found that, in contrast to the gene organisation and protein coding sequences, similarities in the promoter sequences were limited to the first few hundred nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon. The function of this region was studied by isolating the core promoter of the Arabidopsis thaliana ALDH7B4 gene, taken as model. The promoter was found to be responsive to wounding in addition to salt and dehydration stress. Cis-acting elements involved in stress responsiveness were analysed and two conserved ACGT-containing motifs proximal to the translation start codon were found to be essential for the responsiveness to osmotic stress in leaves and in seeds. The integrity of an upstream ACGT motif and a dehydration-responsive element/C-repeat-low temperature-responsive element was found to be necessary for ALDH7B4 expression in seeds and induction by salt, dehydration and ABA in leaves. The comparison of the gene expression in selected Arabidopsis mutants demonstrated that osmotic stress-induced ALDH7B4 expression in leaves and seeds involves both ABA- and lipid-signalling components.
