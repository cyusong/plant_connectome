['19667208', 'A previously undescribed forward chemical genetic screen using hydrolases  affecting the extracellular matrix is introduced. The developed screen takes  advantage of the power of chemical genetics and combines it with the known  substrate specificity of glycosylhydrolases, resulting in the selection of  conditional mutants that exhibit structural defects in their extracellular  matrix. Identification of the responsible genetic locus in those mutants  significantly extends our knowledge of genes involved in the biosynthesis,  metabolism, signaling, and functionality of components of the extracellular  matrix. The method is exemplified by a screen of mutagenized Arabidopsis plants  subjected to growth in liquid culture in the presence of a xyloglucanase, an  enzyme acting on the major cross-linking glycan found in the extracellular matrix  of this plant. Using this hydrolase-based screen, dozens of plant cell wall  mutants (xeg mutants) were identified, leading to the identification of 23  genetic loci that affect plant cell walls. One of the identified loci is XEG113,  encoding a family 77 glycosyltransferase (GT77). Detailed analysis of the wall of  this mutant indicated that its extensins, structural glyocoproteins present in  walls, are underarabinosylated. Xeg-113 plants exhibit more elongated hypocotyls  than WT, providing genetic evidence that plant O-glycosylation--more  specifically, extensin arabinosylation--is important for cell elongation.', '2009 Aug 25', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0905434106', 'Pauly']
