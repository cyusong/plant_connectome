The tomato extreme resistance R-gene encodes Tm2/ Tm22 protein that interacts with the tobamovirus movement protein (MP) to induce hypersensitive response (HR) resulting in local resistance. R-gene mediated local resistance requires a functional RbCS that interacts with MP, restricting virus local infection. RbCS-MP interaction is also required for tobamovirus systemic infection. “Loss-of-function” RbCS allows local but not systemic infection. Thus, RbCS, a cellular gene, acts as a double surveillance agent to protect plant from pathogenic attack, suggesting a previously un-recognized defense strategy in plants.
