In the field, plants usually have to face the combined effects of abiotic and biotic stresses. In our study, two spring wheat cultivars-Septima and Quintus-were subjected to three water regimes [70%, 50%, and 40% soil water capacity (SWC)], aphid (<i>Metopolophium dirhodum</i>) infestation, or the combination of both stresses, i.e., water deficit (50%, 40% SWC) and aphids. The study has a 2 × 3 × 2 factorial design with three biological replicates. In the present study, the results of proteomic analysis using 2D-DIGE followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF protein identification are presented. Water deficit but also aphid infestation led to alterations in 113 protein spots including proteins assigned to a variety of biological processes ranging from signaling <i>via</i> energy metabolism, redox regulation, and stress and defense responses to secondary metabolism indicating a long-term adaptation to adverse conditions. The absence of specific proteins involved in plant response to herbivorous insects indicates a loss of resistance to aphids in modern wheat cultivars during the breeding process and is in accordance with the "plant vigor hypothesis." Septima revealed enhanced tolerance with respect to Quintus as indicated by higher values of morphophysiological characteristics (fresh aboveground biomass, leaf length, osmotic potential per full water saturation) and relative abundance of proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration and ATP biosynthesis.
