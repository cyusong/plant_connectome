Biotic stresses caused by microbial pathogens impair crop yield and quality if not restricted by expensive and often ecologically problematic pesticides. For a sustainable agriculture of tomorrow, breeding or engineering of pathogen-resistant crop varieties is therefore a major cornerstone. Maize is one of the four most important cereal crops in the world. The biotrophic fungal pathogen <i>Ustilago maydis</i> causes galls on all aerial parts of the maize plant. Biotrophic pathogens like <i>U. maydis</i> co-evolved with their host plant and depend during their life cycle on successful manipulation of the host's cellular machinery. Therefore, removing or altering plant susceptibility genes is an effective and usually durable way to obtain resistance in plants. Transcriptional time course experiments in <i>U. maydis</i>-infected maize revealed numerous maize genes being upregulated upon establishment of biotrophy. Among these genes is the maize <i>LIPOXYGENASE 3</i> (<i>LOX3</i>) previously shown to be a susceptibility factor for other fungal genera as well. Aiming to engineer durable resistance in maize against <i>U. maydis</i> and possibly other pathogens, we took a Cas endonuclease technology approach to generate loss of function mutations in <i>LOX3. lox3</i> maize mutant plants react with an enhanced PAMP-triggered ROS burst implicating an enhanced defense response. Based on visual assessment of disease symptoms and quantification of relative fungal biomass, homozygous <i>lox3</i> mutant plants exposed to <i>U. maydis</i> show significantly decreased susceptibility. <i>U. maydis</i> infection assays using a transposon mutant <i>lox3</i> maize line further substantiated that <i>LOX3</i> is a susceptibility factor for this important maize pathogen.
