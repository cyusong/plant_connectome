<i>Bacillus subtilis</i> is a Gram-positive plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium exerting many beneficial effects on plant health. Because they secrete antimicrobial compounds and elicit induced systemic resistance, <i>B. subtilis</i> and phylogenetically related species are of particular interest as antifungals in organic agriculture. These bacteria are also known for their capacity to differentiate phenotypically into endospores able to withstand many environmental stresses. However, although <i>B. subtilis</i> is often inoculated on plants as spores, dynamics of germination and sporulation on roots remain unexplored. Using a hydroponic culture system and a soil system for <i>Arabidopsis thaliana,</i> we observed that <i>B. subtilis</i> spores germinate rapidly on contact with plants. However, the vegetative cells are abundant on roots for only a few days before reversing back to spores. We observed that the germinant receptor GerK and sporulation kinases KinA and KinB identified in vitro control sporulation dynamics on plants. Surprisingly, when plants are inoculated with <i>B. subtilis,</i> free-living cells sporulate more rapidly than plant-associated cells. However, direct contact between plant and bacteria is required for the induction of sporulation in the surrounding <i>B. subtilis</i>. This study has fundamental implications for our understanding of interactions between <i>Bacillus</i> spp. and plants, and particularly for a more efficient usage of <i>B. subtilis</i> as a biofertilizer or biofungicide.
