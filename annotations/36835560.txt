Teak (<i>Tectona grandis</i>) is one of the most important wood sources, and it is cultivated in tropical regions with a significant market around the world. Abiotic stresses are an increasingly common and worrying environmental phenomenon because it causes production losses in both agriculture and forestry. Plants adapt to these stress conditions by activation or repression of specific genes, and they synthesize numerous stress proteins to maintain their cellular function. For example, APETALA2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) was found to be involved in stress signal transduction. A search in the teak transcriptome database identified an <i>AP2/ERF</i> gene named <i>TgERF1</i> with a key AP2/ERF domain. We then verified that the <i>TgERF1</i> expression is rapidly induced by Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), NaCl, and exogenous phytohormone treatments, suggesting a potential role in drought and salt stress tolerance in teak. The full-length coding sequence of <i>TgERF1</i> gene was isolated from teak young stems, characterized, cloned, and constitutively overexpressed in tobacco plants. In transgenic tobacco plants, the overexpressed TgERF1 protein was localized exclusively in the cell nucleus, as expected for a transcription factor. Furthermore, functional characterization of <i>TgERF1</i> provided evidence that <i>TgERF1</i> is a promising candidate gene to be used as selective marker on plant breeding intending to improve plant stress tolerance.
