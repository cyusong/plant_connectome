Sucrose synthase (SUS) plays a role in many contexts of sugar metabolism, including low-oxygen and low-ATP respiration and the synthesis of cellulose. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), as in many plants, SUS is encoded by genes at several independent loci. Here, we report the isolation of a novel tomato SUS (SlSUS) isoform, SlSUS4, that is homologous to potato SUS isoform 1 (StSUS1) and also shows greater homology to SUS isoforms of other plants than to the other tomato SUS isoforms. All three tomato isoforms are very similar in genomic structure and sequence, yet each is located on a separate chromosome. Real-time expression analysis of the three distinct isoforms revealed widely varying patterns of expression, in terms of both tissue specificity and overall magnitude of expression. Analysis of SlSUS expression along the tomato stem revealed opposing expression gradients for two of the SlSUS isoforms, in apparent correlation with vascular tissue maturation. Western-blot analysis of SlSUS protein showed an increasing SlSUS concentration gradient along the developmental axis of the tomato stem, with the protein concentrated mainly in the vascular tissue of the stem. These gene expression and protein accumulation patterns indicate that each isoform may play a discrete role in the development of tomato plants, most notably in the development of vascular tissue in the stem.
