['20460583', 'The final size of plant organs, such as leaves, is tightly controlled by  environmental and genetic factors that must spatially and temporally coordinate  cell expansion and cell cycle activity. However, this regulation of organ growth  is still poorly understood. The aim of this study is to gain more insight into  the genetic control of leaf size in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) by  performing a comparative analysis of transgenic lines that produce enlarged  leaves under standardized environmental conditions. To this end, we selected five  genes belonging to different functional classes that all positively affect leaf  size when overexpressed: AVP1, GRF5, JAW, BRI1, and GA20OX1. We show that the  increase in leaf area in these lines depended on leaf position and growth  conditions and that all five lines affected leaf size differently; however, in  all cases, an increase in cell number was, entirely or predominantly, responsible  for the leaf size enlargement. By analyzing hormone levels, transcriptome, and  metabolome, we provide deeper insight into the molecular basis of the growth  phenotype for the individual lines. A comparative analysis between these data  sets indicates that enhanced organ growth is governed by different, seemingly  independent pathways. The analysis of transgenic lines simultaneously  overexpressing two growth-enhancing genes further supports the concept that  multiple pathways independently converge on organ size control in Arabidopsis.', '2010 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.156018', 'Inze']
