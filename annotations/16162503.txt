['16162503', 'Cyanobacterial and plant genomes encode proteins with some similarity to the  folate and biopterin transporters of the trypanosomatid parasite Leishmania. The  Synechocystis slr0642 gene product and its closest Arabidopsis homolog, the  At2g32040 gene product, are representative examples. Both have 12 probable  transmembrane domains, and the At2g32040 protein has a predicted chloroplast  transit peptide. When expressed in Escherichia coli pabA pabB or folE, mutants,  which are unable to produce or take up folates, the slr0642 protein and a  modified At2g32040 protein (truncated and fused to the N terminus of slr0642)  enabled growth on 5-formyltetrahydrofolate or folic acid but not on  5-formyltetrahydrofolate triglutamate, demonstrating that both proteins mediate  folate monoglutamate transport. Both proteins also mediate transport of the  antifolate analogs methotrexate and aminopterin, as evidenced by their ability to  greatly increase the sensitivity of E. coli to these inhibitors. The full-length  At2g32040 polypeptide was translocated into isolated pea chloroplasts and, when  fused to green fluorescent protein, directed the passenger protein to the  envelope of Arabidopsis chloroplasts in transient expression experiments.  At2g32040 transcripts were present at similar levels in roots and aerial organs,  indicating that the protein occurs in non-green plastids as well as chloroplasts.  Insertional inactivation of At2g32040 significantly raised the total folate  content of chloroplasts and lowered the proportion of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate  but did not discernibly affect growth. These findings establish conservation of  function among folate and biopterin transporter family proteins from three  kingdoms of life.', '2005 Nov 18', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M507432200', 'Hanson']
