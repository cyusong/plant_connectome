As an important transcription factor family, <i>GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs</i> (<i>GRFs</i>) are involved in central development processes, including growth regulation, insect and disease resistance, and stress response. The <i>OsGRF7</i> has recently been shown involving in modulating leaf angle through regulating GA and IAA metabolism. Interestingly, we found that <i>OsGRF7</i> negatively regulates the tiller number. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of <i>OsGRF7</i> underlying the tiller number determination are still not understood. Here, we report that OsGRF7 directly targets the promoter of the <i>NODULATION SIGNALING PATHWAY2</i> (<i>OsNSP2</i>), a key factor involving in the strigolactone synthesis. Correspondingly, <i>OsGRF7</i> alters the expression level of <i>OsNSP2</i> and the endogenous strigolactone content, which rendered repression of the outgrowth of the axillary buds. These findings unveil a novel function of <i>OsGRF7</i> in rice tillering determination.
