The plant patellin (PATL) proteins are yeast Sec14 protein (Sec14p)-like phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs), which are widely distributed across the plant kingdom. The model plant Arabidopsis has six PATL members (designated as PATL1-PATL6). Accumulated evidence has indicated the involvement of Arabidopsis PATLs in various biological processes. This mini-review briefly summarizes our current knowledge on individual PATLs regarding their roles in plant development and stress tolerance regulation. The elucidation of PATLs' biological function in plants will provide new insights on plant membrane trafficking and its regulatory roles in either plant growth or environmental stress response signaling networks.
