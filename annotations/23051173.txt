The complex Rsv1 locus in soybean plant introduction (PI) 'PI96983' confers extreme resistance (ER) against Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) strain N but not SMV-G7 and SMV-G7d. Both the SMV helper-component proteinase (HC-Pro) and P3 cistrons can serve as avirulence factors recognized by Rsv1. To understand the genetics underlying recognition of the two cistrons, we have utilized two soybean lines (L800 and L943) derived from crosses between PI96983 (Rsv1) and Lee68 (rsv1) with distinct recombination events within the Rsv1 locus. L800 contains a single PI96983-derived member (3gG2) of an Rsv1-associated subfamily of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) genes. In contrast, although L943 lacks 3gG2, it contains a suite of five other NB-LRR genes belonging to the same family. L800 confers ER against SMV-N whereas L943 allows limited replication at the inoculation site. SMV-N-derived chimeras containing HC-Pro from SMV-G7 or SMV-G7d gained virulence on L943 but not on L800 whereas those with P3 replacement gained virulence on L800 but not on L943. In reciprocal experiments, SMV-G7- and SMV-G7d-derived chimeras with HC-Pro replacement from SMV-N lost virulence on L943 but retained virulence on L800 whereas those with P3 replacement lost virulence on L800 while remaining virulent on L943. These data demonstrate that distinct resistance genes at the Rsv1 locus, likely belonging to the NB-LRR class, mediate recognition of HC-Pro and P3.
