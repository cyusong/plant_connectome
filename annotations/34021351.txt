The chloroplasts and mitochondria of photosynthetic eukaryotes contain proteins that are closely related to cytosolic Guided Entry of Tail-anchored proteins3 (Get3). Get3 is a targeting factor that efficiently escorts tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the ER. Because other components of the cytosolic-targeting pathway appear to be absent in organelles, previous investigators have asserted that organellar Get3 homologs are unlikely to act as targeting factors. However, we show here both that the Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplast homolog designated as GET3B is structurally similar to cytosolic Get3 proteins and that it selectively binds a thylakoid-localized TA protein. Based on genetic interactions between a get3b mutation and mutations affecting the chloroplast signal recognition particle-targeting pathway, as well as changes in the abundance of photosynthesis-related proteins in mutant plants, we propose that GET3B acts primarily to direct proteins to the thylakoids. Furthermore, through molecular complementation experiments, we show that function of GET3B depends on its ability to hydrolyze ATP, and this is consistent with action as a targeting factor. We propose that GET3B and related organellar Get3 homologs play a role that is analogous to that of cytosolic Get3 proteins, and that GET3B acts as a targeting factor in the chloroplast stroma to deliver TA proteins in a membrane-specific manner.
