To better understand the nature of resistance of tomato to the whitefly (Bemisia tabaci, B biotype)-transmitted Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), whiteflies and TYLCV were considered as particular cases of biotic stresses and virus resistance as a particular case of successful response to these stresses. Two inbred tomato lines issued from the same breeding program that used Solanum habrochaites as a TYLCV resistance source, one susceptible and the other resistant, were used to compare the expression of key proteins involved at different stages of the plant response with stresses: mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), cellular heat shock proteins (HSPs, proteases), and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. The two biotic stresses-non-viruliferous whitefly feeding and virus infection with viruliferous insects--led to a slow decline in abundance of MAPKs, HSPs, and chloroplast protease FtsH (but not chloroplast protease ClpC), and induced the activities of the PR proteins, beta-1,3-glucanase, and peroxidase. This decline was less pronounced in virus-resistant than in virus-susceptible lines. Contrary to whitefly infestation and virus infection, inoculation with the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum induced a rapid accumulation of the stress proteins studied, followed by a decline; the virus-susceptible and -resistant tomato lines behaved similarly in response to the fungus.

MAPKs: !decline in abundance! biotic stresses
HSPs: !decline in abundance! biotic stresses
FtsH: !decline in abundance! biotic stresses
ClpC: !no decline in abundance! biotic stresses
beta-1,3-glucanase: !induced! biotic stresses
peroxidase: !induced! biotic stresses
biotic stresses: !less pronounced decline! virus-resistant lines
fungus: !rapid accumulation of stress proteins! virus-susceptible and -resistant tomato lines
