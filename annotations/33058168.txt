Sensing and response to high temperatures are crucial to prevent heat-related damage and to preserve cellular and metabolic functions. The response to heat stress is a complex and coordinated process that involves several subcellular compartments and multi-level regulatory networks that are synchronized to avoid cell damage while maintaining cellular homeostasis. In this review, we provide an insight into the most recent advances in elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in heat stress sensing and response in Marchantia polymorpha. Based on the signaling pathways and genes that were identified in Marchantia, our analyses indicate that although with specific particularities, the core components of the heat stress response seem conserved in bryophytes and angiosperms. Liverworts not only constitute a powerful tool to study heat stress response and signaling pathways during plant evolution, but also provide key and simple mechanisms to cope with extreme temperatures. Given the increasing prevalence of high temperatures around the world as a result of global warming, this knowledge provides a new set of molecular tools with potential agronomical applications.
