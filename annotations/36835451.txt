<i>Metarhizium anisopliae</i> is an entomopathogenic fungus which may enhance plant growth and resistance when acting as an endophyte in host plants. However, little is known about the protein interactions nor their activating mechanisms. Common in fungal extracellular membrane (CFEM) proteins have been identified as plant immune regulators that suppress or activate plant resistance responses. Here, we identified a CFEM domain-containing protein, MaCFEM85, which was mainly localized in the plasma membrane. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that MaCFEM85 interacted with the extracellular domain of a <i>Medicago sativa</i> (alfalfa) membrane protein, MsWAK16. Gene expression analyses showed that MaCFEM85 and MsWAK16 were significantly upregulated in <i>M. anisopliae</i> and <i>M. sativa</i>, respectively, from 12 to 60 h after co-inoculation. Additional yeast two-hybrid assays and amino acid site-specific mutation indicated that the CFEM domain and 52th cysteine specifically were required for the interaction of MaCFEM85 with MsWAK16. Defense function assays showed that JA was up-regulated, but <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> lesion size and <i>Myzus persicae</i> reproduction were suppressed by transient expression of MaCFEM85 and MsWAK16 in the model host plant <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Collectively, these results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions of <i>M. anisopliae</i> with host plants.
