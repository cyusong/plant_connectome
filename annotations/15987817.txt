['15987817', 'Splicing of rare, U12-type or AT-AC introns is mediated by a distinct spliceosome  that assembles from U11, U12, U4atac, U6atac, and U5 snRNPs. Although in human  cells the protein composition of minor and major snRNPs is similar, differences,  particularly in U11 and U12 snRNPs, have been recently described. We have  identified an Arabidopsis U11 snRNP-specific 35K protein as an interacting  partner of an RS-domain-containing cyclophilin. By using a transient expression  system in Arabidopsis protoplasts, we show that the 35K protein incorporates into  snRNP. Oligo affinity selection and glycerol gradient centrifugation revealed  that the Arabidopsis 35K protein is present in monomeric U11 snRNP and in  U11/U12-di snRNP. The interaction of the 35K protein with Arabidopsis SR proteins  together with its strong sequence similarity to U1-70K suggests that its function  in splicing of minor introns is analogous to that of U1-70K. Analysis of  Arabidopsis and Oryza sativa genome sequences revealed that all  U11/U12-di-snRNP-specific proteins are conserved in dicot and monocot plants. In  addition, we have identified an Arabidopsis gene encoding the homolog of U4atac  snRNA and a second Arabidopsis gene encoding U6atac snRNA. Secondary structure  predictions indicate that the Arabidopsis U4atac is able to form dimeric  complexes with both Arabidopsis U6atac snRNAs. As revealed by RNaseA/T1  protection assay, the U4atac snRNA gene is expressed as an ~160-nt RNA, whereas  the second U6atac snRNA gene seems to be a pseudogene. Taken together, our data  indicate that recognition and splicing of minor, AT-AC introns in plants is  highly similar to that in humans.', '2005 Jul', 'RNA', '10.1261/rna.2440305', 'Barta']
