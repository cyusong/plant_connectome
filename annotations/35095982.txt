Nitrate nitrogen ( <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mtext>NO</mtext> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </math> -N) in the soil is one of the important nutrients for growing crops. During the period of precipitation or irrigation, an excessive <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mtext>NO</mtext> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </math> -N readily causes its leaching or runoff from the soil surface to rivers due to inaccurate fertilization and water management, leading to non-point source pollution. In general, the measurement of the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mtext>NO</mtext> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </math> -N relies upon the laboratory-based absorbance, which is often time-consuming, therefore not suitable for the rapid measurements in the field directly. Ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) support the possibility of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mtext>NO</mtext> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </math> -N measurement by measuring the nitrate ( <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mtext>NO</mtext> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </math> ) ions in soil quickly and accurately due to the high water solubility and mobility of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mtext>NO</mtext> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </math> ions. However, such a method suffers from a complicated calibration to remove the influences caused by both temperature and other ions in the measured solution, thus limiting field use. In this study, a kind of all-solid ISE system combined with a temperature sensor and a pH electrode is proposed to automatically measure the concentrations of the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mtext>NO</mtext> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </math> -N. In this study, a soil water content calibration function was established, which significantly reduces a relative error (RE) by 13.09%. The experimental results showed that the stabilization time of this electrode system was less than 15 s with a slope of -51.63 mV/decade in the linear range of 10<sup>-5</sup>-10<sup>-2.2</sup> mol/L. Both the limit of detection of 0.5 ppm of the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mtext>NO</mtext> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </math> -N and a relative SD of less than 3% were obtained together with the recovery rate of 90-110%. Compared with the UV-Vis spectroscopy method, a correlation coefficient (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>) of 0.9952 was obtained. The performances of this all-solid ISE system are satisfied for measuring the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mtext>NO</mtext> <mn>3</mn> <mo>-</mo></msubsup> </math> -N in the field.
