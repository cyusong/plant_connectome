Cellular DNA is continually exposed to a large variety of external and internal DNA-damaging agents. Although lesions can be removed by different repair processes, damages often remain in the DNA during replication, and specialized DNA polymerases are needed to perform translesion synthesis past damaged sites. These enzymes, in contrast to replicative polymerases, operate at low processivity and fidelity. DNA polymerase eta and Rev 1 are two proteins found in eukaryotes that are involved in translesion replication past specific DNA damages. In Arabidopsis, DNA polymerase eta and Rev 1 are encoded by AtPOLH and AtREV1 genes, respectively. The beta-glucuronidase gene product under the control of AtPOLH and AtREV1 gene promoters was used to determine their expression in different tissues. The GUS assay showed a ubiquitous expression of the reporter gene in all tissues and during the complete life cycle. In addition, quantitative real-time RT-PCR confirmed the ubiquitous expression of AtPOLH and AtREV1, and showed that the average expression of AtREV1 was approximately five times higher than AtPOLH. Transcription of both genes did not increase in the presence of visible light or after UV irradiation.

AtREV1: !promotes! beta-glucuronidase gene product 
AtPOLH: !has average expression! 5x lower than AtREV1 
AtPOLH: !does not increase expression! in presence of visible light or after UV irradiation
