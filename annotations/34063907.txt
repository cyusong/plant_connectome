Plant mitochondria have large genomes to house a small number of key genes. Most mitochondria do not contain a whole genome. Despite these latter characteristics, the mitochondrial genome is faithfully maternally inherited. To maintain the mitochondrial genes-so important for energy production-the fusion and fission of mitochondria are critical. Fission in plants is better understood than fusion, with the dynamin-related proteins (DRP 3A and 3B) driving the constriction of the mitochondrion. How the endoplasmic reticulum and the cytoskeleton are linked to the fission process is not yet fully understood. The fusion mechanism is less well understood, as obvious orthologues are not present. However, there is a recently described gene, <i>MIRO2</i>, that appears to have a significant role, as does the ER and cytoskeleton. Massive mitochondrial fusion (MMF or hyperfusion) plays a significant role in plants. MMF occurs at critical times of the life cycle, prior to flowering, in the enlarging zygote and at germination, mixing the cells' mitochondrial population-the so-called "discontinuous whole". MMF in particular aids genome repair, the conservation of critical genes and possibly gives an energy boost to important stages of the life cycle. MMF is also important in plant regeneration, an important component of plant biotechnology.
