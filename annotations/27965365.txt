Secondary growth occurs in dicotyledons and gymnosperms, and results in an increased girth of plant organs. It is driven primarily by the vascular cambium, which produces thousands of cells throughout the life of several plant species. For instance, even in the small herbaceous model plant Arabidopsis, manual quantification of this massive process is impractical. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of current methods used to measure radial growth. We discuss the issues and problematics related to its quantification. We highlight recent advances and tools developed for automated cellular phenotyping and its future applications.
