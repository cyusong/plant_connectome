Drought stress is a considerable environmental factor that restrains photosynthesis. Lutein, the most prolific carotenoid in plant photosynthetic tissues, plays vital roles in the light-harvesting complexes. However, its biological functions under abiotic stresses remain unclear. In our research, transgenic tobacco plants were utilized to investigate the function of the tomato chloroplast-targeted carotenoid epsilon-ring hydroxylase (SlLUT1) in drought stress tolerance. The analysis of SlLUT1-pro-LUC and qRT-PCR showed that drought stress induced SlLUT1 expression. Transgenic tobacco plants exhibit higher lutein content than wild-type (WT) tobacco. Under drought stress, transgenic plants overexpressing SlLUT1 showed better growth performance, higher chlorophyll and relative water contents and more intact chloroplast and PSII supercomplex structures than WT tobacco. The Fv/Fm, Pn, NPQ, and content of D1 protein in transgenic plants were higher than those in WT plants under drought stress. The accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> decreased in transgenic tobacco plants. Moreover, transgenic plants exhibited lower MDA accumulation and REL. These results indicate that overexpression of SlLUT1 enhances tolerance to drought stress by maintaining photosynthesis and scavenging ROS in transgenic tobacco.
