['9121476', 'The putative RNA helicases of the DEAD-box protein family are involved in  pre-mRNA splicing, rRNA maturation, ribosome assembly, and translation. Members  of this protein family have been identified in organisms from Escherichia coli to  humans, but except for the translation initiation factor 4A, there have been no  reports on the characterization of other DEAD-box proteins from plants. Here we  report on a novel member of the DEAD-box protein family, the plant RNA helicase  75 (PRH75). PRH75 is localized in the nucleus and contains two domains for RNA  binding. One is located at the C terminus and is similar to RGG RNA-binding  domains of nucleus-localized RNA-binding proteins. The other one is located  between amino acids 308 and 622, a region containing the conserved motif VI  characteristic of DEAD-box proteins and known as the RNA-binding site of eIF-4A.  The N-terminal 81 amino acids are sufficient for nuclear targeting of the  protein. Northern and Western blot analyses show that PRH75 is mainly expressed  in young and rapidly developing tissues. The purified recombinant PRH75 has a  weak ATPase activity which is barely stimulated by RNA ligands. The fractionation  of spinach whole-cell extracts by glycerol gradient centrifugation and gel  filtration on a Superdex 200 column shows that the protein exists in a complex of  about 500 kDa. Possible biological functions of PRH75 as well as  structure-function relationships in the context of its modular primary structure  are discussed.', '1997 Apr', 'Mol Cell Biol', '10.1128/MCB.17.4.2257', 'Oelmuller']
