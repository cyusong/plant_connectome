The distribution of the endogenous PA fractions throughout the entire perennial woody grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) plant was studied, along with the expression profiles of the PA anabolic and catabolic genes and their substrates and secondary metabolites. Putrescine fractions increased with increasing leaf age, although the expression of its biosynthetic enzymes Arg and Orn decarboxylases decreased. Orn transport from young organs dramatically enhanced putrescine biosynthesis in older tissues, via the Orn decarboxylase pathway. S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and spermidine synthase genes were down-regulated during development in a tissue/organ-specific manner, as were spermidine and spermine levels. In contrast, amine oxidases, peroxidases and phenolics increased from the youngest to the fully developed vascular tissues; they also increased from the peripheral regions of leaves to the petioles. Hydrogen peroxide generated by amine oxidases accumulated for the covalent linkage of proteins via peroxidases during lignification. These results could be valuable for addressing further questions on the role of PAs in plant development.
