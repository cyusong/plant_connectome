Fibrillins (FBNs) are a family of genes in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. The proteins they encode possess a lipid-binding motif, exist in various types of plastids, and are associated with lipid bodies called plastoglobules, implicating them in lipid metabolism. FBNs present in the thylakoid and stroma are involved in the storage, transport, and synthesis of lipid molecules for photoprotective functions against high-light stress. In this review, the diversity of subplastid locations in the evolution of FBNs, regulation of FBNs expression by various stresses, and the role of FBNs in plastid lipid metabolism are comprehensively summarized and directions for future research are discussed.
