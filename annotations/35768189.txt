The N-terminus is a frequent site of protein modifications. Referring primarily to knowledge gained from land plants, here we review the modifications that change protein N-terminal residues and provide updated information about the associated machinery, including that in Archaeplastida. These N-terminal modifications include many proteolytic events as well as small group additions such as acylation or arginylation and oxidation. Compared with that of the mitochondrion, the plastid-dedicated N-terminal modification landscape is far more complex. In parallel, we extend this review to plastid-containing Chromalveolata including Stramenopiles, Apicomplexa, and Rhizaria. We report a well-conserved machinery, especially in the plastid. Consideration of the two most abundant proteins on Earth-Rubisco and actin-reveals the complexity of N-terminal modification processes. The progressive gene transfer from the plastid to the nuclear genome during evolution is exemplified by the N-terminus modification machinery, which appears to be one of the latest to have been transferred to the nuclear genome together with crucial major photosynthetic landmarks. This is evidenced by the greater number of plastid genes in Paulinellidae and red algae, the most recent and fossil recipients of primary endosymbiosis.
