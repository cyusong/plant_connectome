The effect of Nod factors on gas exchange characteristics and growth of soybean plants was studied. Soybean responded positively to some concentrations of Nod factors. Photosynthesis was increased up to 13% over the control, and this was accompanied by increases in stomatal conductance; plant dry weight was also increased. Near-fully expanded leaves responded more strongly to Nod factors than fully expanded leaves. Only Nod factor NodBj-V (C18:1, MeFuc) had significant effects on soybean. The finding suggests that Nod factors can affect photosynthesis, possibly indirectly, by stimulating sink strength.
