Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) produces an important reduction in the accumulation of proteins related to energy metabolism. The treatment of hairy roots (HR) with MeJA increased the accumulation of H2O2 during the first 48 h and this H2O2 accumulation was also observed in isolated mitochondria. Peroxidase and catalase activities decreased in the presence of MeJA, and this decrease directly correlated with the increase of H2O2 in HR treated with MeJA. This suggests that the H2O2 burst due to MeJA is the initial response to mitochondria disruption in the roots.

MeJA: !produces! reduction in energy metabolism proteins 
MeJA: !increases! H2O2 accumulation 
H2O2: !correlates with! decrease in peroxidase and catalase activities 
MeJA: !disrupts! mitochondria
