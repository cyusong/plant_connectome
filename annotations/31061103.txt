['31061103', 'Photomorphogenesis is a critical plant developmental process that involves  light-mediated transcriptome and histone modification changes. The transcription  factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) acts downstream of multiple families of  photoreceptors to promote photomorphogenesis by regulating the expression of  light-responsive genes. However, the molecular mechanism for HY5-mediated  transcriptional regulation remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that  HY5 directly interacts with a Reduced Potassium Dependence3/Histone Deacetylase1  (HDA1)-type histone deacetylase, HDA15, both in vitro and in vivo. Phenotypic  analysis revealed that HDA15 is a negative regulator of hypocotyl cell elongation  under both red and far-red light conditions in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  seedlings. The enzymatic activity of HDA15 is required for inhibition of  hypocotyl elongation. Furthermore, HDA15 and HY5 act interdependently in the  repression of hypocotyl cell elongation in photomorphogenesis. Genome-wide  transcriptome analysis revealed that HDA15 and HY5 corepress the transcription of  a subset of cell wall organization and auxin signaling-related genes. In  addition, HDA15 is required for the function of HY5 in the repression of genes  related to hypocotyl cell elongation in Arabidopsis seedlings. Moreover, HY5  recruits HDA15 to the promoters of target genes and represses gene expression by  decreasing the levels of histone H4 acetylation in a light-dependent manner. Our  study revealed a key transcription regulatory node in which HY5 interacts with  HDA15 involved in repressing hypocotyl cell elongation to promote  photomorphogenesis.', '2019 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00055', 'ORCID:']
