Auxins play important roles in the nodulation of legumes. However, the mechanism by which auxin signaling regulates root nodulation is largely unknown. In particular, the role of auxin receptors and their regulation in determinate nodule development remains elusive. We checked the expression pattern of the auxin receptor GmTIR1/GmAFB3 genes in soybean. We analyzed the functions of GmTIR1/AFB3 in the regulation of rhizobial infection and nodule number, and also tested the functions of miR393 during nodulation and its relationship with GmTIR1/AFB3. The results showed that GmTIR1 and GmAFB3 genes exhibit diverse expression patterns during nodulation and overexpression of GmTIR1 genes significantly increased inflection foci and eventual nodule number. GmTIR1/AFB3 genes were post-transcriptionally cleaved by miR393 family and knock-down of the miR393 family members significantly increased rhizobial infection and the nodule number. Overexpression of the mutated form of GmTIR1C at the miR393 cleavage site that is resistant to miR393 cleavage led to a further increase in the number of infection foci and nodules, suggesting that miR393s modulate nodulation by directly targeting GmTIR1C. This study demonstrated that GmTIR1- and GmAFB3-mediated auxin signaling, that is spatio-temporally regulated by miR393, plays a crucial role in determinate nodule development in soybean.
