Plant root growth is indeterminate but continuously responds to environmental changes. We previously reported on the severe root growth defect of a double mutant in <i>bZIP17</i> and <i>bZIP28</i> (<i>bz1728</i>) modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR). To elucidate the mechanism by which <i>bz1728</i> seedlings develop a short root, we obtained a series of <i>bz1728</i> suppressor mutants, called <i>nobiro</i>, for rescued root growth. We focused here on <i>nobiro6</i>, which is defective in the general transcription factor component TBP-ASSOCIATED FACTOR 12b (TAF12b). The expression of hundreds of genes, including the bZIP60-UPR regulon, was induced in the <i>bz1728</i> mutant, but these inductions were markedly attenuated in the <i>bz1728nobiro6</i> mutant. In view of this, we assigned transcriptional cofactor activity via physical interaction with bZIP60 to NOBIRO6/TAF12b. The single <i>nobiro6</i>/<i>taf12b</i> mutant also showed an altered sensitivity to endoplasmic reticulum stress for both UPR and root growth responses, demonstrating that NOBIRO6/TAF12b contributes to environment-responsive root growth control through UPR.
