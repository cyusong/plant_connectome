['20023196', 'Asn-linked glycans, or the glycan code, carry crucial information for protein  folding, transport, sorting, and degradation. The biochemical pathway for  generating such a code is highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms and consists  of ordered assembly of a lipid-linked tetradeccasaccharide. Most of our current  knowledge on glycan biosynthesis was obtained from studies of yeast  asparagine-linked glycosylation (alg) mutants. By contrast, little is known about  biosynthesis and biological functions of N-glycans in plants. Here, we show that  loss-of-function mutations in the Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of the yeast ALG12  result in transfer of incompletely assembled glycans to polypeptides. This  metabolic defect significantly compromises the endoplasmic reticulum-associated  degradation of bri1-9 and bri1-5, two defective transmembrane receptors for  brassinosteroids. Consequently, overaccumulated bri1-9 or bri1-5 proteins  saturate the quality control systems that retain the two mutated receptors in the  endoplasmic reticulum and can thus leak out of the folding compartment, resulting  in phenotypic suppression of the two bri1 mutants. Our results strongly suggest  that the complete assembly of the lipid-linked glycans is essential for  successful quality control of defective glycoproteins in Arabidopsis.', '2009 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.070284', 'Li']
