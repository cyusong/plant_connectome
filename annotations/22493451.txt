['22493451', 'Leucine aminopeptidases (LAPs) are present in animals, plants, and microbes. In  plants, there are two classes of LAPs. The neutral LAPs (LAP-N and its orthologs)  are constitutively expressed and detected in all plants, whereas the  stress-induced acidic LAPs (LAP-A) are expressed only in a subset of the  Solanaceae. LAPs have a role in insect defense and act as a regulator of the late  branch of wound signaling in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato). Although the  mechanism of LAP-A action is unknown, it has been presumed that LAP peptidase  activity is essential for regulating wound signaling. Here we show that plant  LAPs are bifunctional. Using three assays to monitor protein protection from  heat-induced damage, it was shown that the tomato LAP-A and LAP-N and the  Arabidopsis thaliana LAP1 and LAP2 are molecular chaperones. Assays using LAP-A  catalytic site mutants demonstrated that LAP-A chaperone activity was independent  of its peptidase activity. Furthermore, disruption of the LAP-A hexameric  structure increased chaperone activity. Together, these data identify a new class  of molecular chaperones and a new function for the plant LAPs as well as  suggesting new mechanisms for LAP action in the defense of solanaceous plants  against stress.', '2012 May 25', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M111.309500', 'Walling']
