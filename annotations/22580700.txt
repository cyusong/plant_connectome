Spatial organ arrangement plays an important role in flower development. The position and the identity of floral organs is influenced by various processes, in particular the expression of MADS-box transcription factors for identity and dynamics of the plant hormone auxin for positioning. We are currently integrating patterning processes of MADS and auxin into our computational models, based on interactions that are known from experiments, in order to get insight in how these define the floral body plan. The resulting computational model will help to explore hypothetical interactions between the MADS and auxin regulation networks in floral organ patterning.
