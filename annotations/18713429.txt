Cormels pieces of four Fusarium susceptible Gladiolus cultivars (Friendship, Peter Pears, Victor Borge and Novalux) formed friable calli when cultured in vitro on Murashige and Skoog basal medium containing various concentrations of auxin and cytokinin. The friable calli established cell suspensions. Plantlet regeneration was obtained from the control callus, control cell suspension derived callus and in vitro selected Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht. resistant cell-lines of Friendship. The in vitro cormlets showed 85-95% germination after breaking dormancy of 8 weeks at 4 degrees C. Cell suspensions of all four Gladiolus cultivars were found to be highly sensitive to fusaric acid. Gradual increase in fusaric acid concentrations to the cell-suspension cultures decreased cell growth considerably. One albino plant was found from the second generation of the in vitro selected cell line of Friendship. The albino plant was found to be highly susceptible to F. oxysporum. The cormlets of all in vitro selected cell lines of Friendship were inoculated with a conidial suspension of the F. oxysporum before planting and were also sprayed with the same spore suspension for further characterization when the height of plants was about 6 cm. The four selected cell lines showed the same response whether or not they were inoculated with conidia of the F. oxysporum. Plantlets of all of the selected cell lines exhibited significant growth as compared with the control after application of conidia of the F. oxysporum.
