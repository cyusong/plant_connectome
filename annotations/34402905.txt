PIN-FORMED (PIN)-mediated polar auxin transport (PAT) is involved in key developmental processes in plants. Various internal and external cues influence plant development via the modulation of intracellular PIN polarity and, thus, the direction of PAT, but the mechanisms underlying these processes remain largely unknown. PIN proteins harbor a hydrophilic loop (HL) that has important regulatory functions; here, we used the HL as bait in protein pulldown screening for modulators of intracellular PIN trafficking in Arabidopsis thaliana. Calcium-dependent protein kinase 29 (CPK29), a Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, was identified and shown to phosphorylate specific target residues on the PIN-HL that were not phosphorylated by other kinases. Furthermore, loss of CPK29 or mutations of the phospho-target residues in PIN-HLs significantly compromised intracellular PIN trafficking and polarity, causing defects in PIN-mediated auxin redistribution and biological processes such as lateral root formation, root twisting, hypocotyl gravitropism, phyllotaxis, and reproductive development. These findings indicate that CPK29 directly interprets Ca2+ signals from internal and external triggers, resulting in the modulation of PIN trafficking and auxin responses.
