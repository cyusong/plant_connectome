DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) genes are related to AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE genes of arabidopsis and are differentially regulated coordinately with endodormancy induction and release in buds of several perennial plant species. DAM genes were first shown to directly impact endodormancy in peach where a deletion of a series of DAM resulted in loss of endodormancy induction. We have cloned and characterized several MADS box genes from the model perennial weed leafy spurge. Leafy spurge DAM genes are preferentially expressed in shoot tips and buds in response to cold temperatures and day length in a manner that is relative to the level of endodormancy induced by various environmental conditions. Over-expression of one DAM gene in arabidopsis delays flowering. Additionally, we show that at least one DAM gene is differentially regulated by chromatin remodeling. Comparisons of the DAM gene promoters between poplar and leafy spurge have identified several conserved sequences that may be important for their expression patterns in response to dormancy-inducing stimuli.
