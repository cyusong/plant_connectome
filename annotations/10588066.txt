['10588066', 'The Arabidopsis mutant npq1, which cannot accumulate zeaxanthin because of a  defective violaxanthin deepoxidase, was used to investigate the role of  zeaxanthin in the stomatal response to blue light. Neither dark-adapted nor  light-treated guard cells or mesophyll cells of the npq1 mutant contained  detectable zeaxanthin. In contrast, wild-type guard cells had a significant  zeaxanthin content in the dark and accumulated large amounts of zeaxanthin when  illuminated. The well-documented red light enhancement of blue light-stimulated  stomatal opening, in which increasing fluence rates of background red light  result in increased response to blue light, was used to probe the specific blue  light response of Arabidopsis stomata. Stomata from the npq1 mutant did not have  a specific blue light response under all fluence rates of background red light  tested. On the other hand, stomata from leaves of hy4 (cry 1), an Arabidopsis  mutant lacking blue light-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, had a  typical enhancement of the blue light response by background red light. The lack  of a specific blue light response in the zeaxanthinless npq1 mutant provides  genetic evidence for the role of zeaxanthin as a blue light photoreceptor in  guard cells.', '1999 Sep', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029627', 'Zeiger']
