It is assumed that the refilling of drought-induced embolism requires the creation of an osmotic gradient between xylem parenchyma cells and vessel lumens to generate the water efflux needed to fill the void. To assess the mechanism of embolism repair, it is crucial to determine if plants can up-regulate the efflux of osmotically active substances into embolized vessels and identify the major components of the released osmoticum. Here, we introduce a new approach of sap collection designed to separate water from nonembolized (functional) and embolized (nonfunctional) vessels. This new approach made possible the chemical analysis of liquid collected from both types of vessels in plants subjected to different levels of water stress. The technique also allowed us to determine the water volumes in nonfunctional vessels as a function of stress level. Overall, with the increase of water stress in plants, the osmotic potential of liquid collected from nonfunctional vessels increased while its volume decreased. These results revealed the presence of both sugars and ions in nonfunctional vessels at elevated levels in comparison with liquid collected from functional vessels, in which only traces of sugars were found. The increased sugar concentration was accompanied by decreased xylem sap pH. These results provide new insight into the biology of refilling, underlining the role of sugar and sugar transporters, and imply that a large degree of hydraulic compartmentalization must exist in the xylem during the refilling process.
