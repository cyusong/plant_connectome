The enzymes called lipoxygenases (LOXs) can dioxygenate unsaturated fatty acids, which leads to lipoperoxidation of biological membranes. This process causes synthesis of signaling molecules and also leads to changes in cellular metabolism. LOXs are known to be involved in apoptotic (programmed cell death) pathway, and biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Here, the members of LOX gene family in Arabidopsis and rice are identified. The Arabidopsis and rice genomes encode 6 and 14 LOX proteins, respectively, and interestingly, with more LOX genes in rice. The rice LOXs are validated based on protein alignment studies. This is the first report wherein LOXs are identified in rice which may allow better understanding the initiation, progression and effects of apoptosis, and responses to bitoic and abiotic stresses and signaling cascades in plants.
