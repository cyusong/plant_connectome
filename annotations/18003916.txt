['18003916', 'Molybdenum (Mo) is a trace element essential for living organisms, however no  molybdate transporter has been identified in eukaryotes. Here, we report the  identification of a molybdate transporter, MOT1, from Arabidopsis thaliana. MOT1  is expressed in both roots and shoots, and the MOT1 protein is localized, in  part, to plasma membranes and to vesicles. MOT1 is required for efficient uptake  and translocation of molybdate and for normal growth under conditions of limited  molybdate supply. Kinetics studies in yeast revealed that the K(m) value of MOT1  for molybdate is approximately 20 nM. Furthermore, Mo uptake by MOT1 in yeast was  not affected by coexistent sulfate, and MOT1 did not complement a sulfate  transporter-deficient yeast mutant strain. These data confirmed that MOT1 is  specific for molybdate and that the high affinity of MOT1 allows plants to obtain  scarce Mo from soil.', '2007 Nov 20', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0706373104', 'Fujiwara']
