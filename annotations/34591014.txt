['34591014', 'Pollen apertures, the characteristic gaps in pollen wall exine, have emerged as a  model for studying the formation of distinct plasma membrane domains. In each  species, aperture number, position, and morphology are typically fixed; across  species they vary widely. During pollen development, certain plasma membrane  domains attract specific proteins and lipids and become protected from exine  deposition, developing into apertures. However, how these aperture domains are  selected is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that patterns of aperture domains in  Arabidopsis are controlled by the members of the ancient ELMOD protein family,  which, although important in animals, has not been studied in plants. We show  that two members of this family, MACARON (MCR) and ELMOD_A, act upstream of the  previously discovered aperture proteins and that their expression levels  influence the number of aperture domains that form on the surface of developing  pollen grains. We also show that a third ELMOD family member, ELMOD_E, can  interfere with MCR and ELMOD_A activities, changing aperture morphology and  producing new aperture patterns. Our findings reveal key players controlling  early steps in aperture domain formation, identify residues important for their  function, and open new avenues for investigating how diversity of aperture  patterns in nature is achieved.', '2021 Sep 30', 'Elife', '10.7554/eLife.71061', 'ORCID:']
