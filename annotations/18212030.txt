Ethylene and gibberellins (GAs) are known to influence plant growth by mutual cross-talk and by interaction with other hormones. Transcript meta-analysis shows that GA and ethylene metabolism genes are expressed in the majority of plant organs. Both GAs and the ethylene precursor 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) may thus be synthesized ubiquitously. Transport of both hormones has been described and might hence lead to a controlled distribution. Transcript meta-analysis also suggests that applying exogenous ethylene to plants represses the expression of GA metabolism genes. Conversely, upon treatment with GAs, the expression of some ethylene synthesis genes is up-regulated. The analysis further shows that the genes coding for signalling components of these hormones are expressed throughout the entire plant. However, a tissue-specific transcript meta-analysis of ethylene synthesis and signalling genes in Arabidopsis roots suggests a more localized function of ethylene in the fast elongation and specialization zone, while GA seems to act in the (pro)meristematic zone and in the transition zone. Recent research has shown that brassinosteroids and auxins exert their function at the epidermis, consequently driving organ growth. From transcript meta-analysis data of Arabidopsis roots, it appears that GAs might also act in a cell type-specific manner.
