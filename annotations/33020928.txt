Ethylene and reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate seed dormancy alleviation, but the molecular basis of their action and crosstalk remains largely unknown. Here we studied the mechanism of Arabidopsis seed dormancy release by ethylene using cell imaging, and genetic and transcriptomics approaches, in order to tackle its possible interaction with ROS homeostasis. We found that the effect of ethylene on seed germination required ROS production by the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Seed response to ethylene involved a mitochondrial retrograde response (MRR) through nuclear ROS production and upregulation of the MRR components AOX1a and ANAC013, but also required the activation of the ethylene canonical pathway. Together our data allowed deciphering of the mode of action of ethylene on seed germination and the associated dynamics of ROS production. Our findings highlight the occurrence of retrograde signalling in seed germination.
