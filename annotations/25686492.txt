['25686492', 'Four different isoforms of the Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) have been  identified in Arabidopsis plant cells. The electrophysiological characteristics  of several VDAC channels from animal as well as plant cells are well documented,  but those of this model plant are unknown. One isoform, AtVDAC-3 was obtained  either directly by cell-free synthesis or produced in Escherichia coli, as  inclusion bodies, and re-natured. An electrophysiological study of the purified  proteins in planar lipid bilayers showed that both methods yielded proteins with  similar channel activity. The characteristics of AtVDAC-3 are that of a bona fide  VDAC-like channel.', '2015 Mar 27', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.02.034', 'Ghazi']
