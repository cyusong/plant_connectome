Genetic transformation is a powerful tool to study gene function, secondary metabolism pathways, and molecular breeding in crops. Cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L.) is one of the most important economic crops in the world. Current cotton transformation methods take at least seven to culture and are labor-intensive and limited to some cultivars. In this study, we first time achieved plantlet regeneration of cotton via embryogenesis from transformed hairy roots. We inoculated the cotyledon explants of a commercial cultivar Zhongmian-24 with <i>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</i> strain AR1193, harboring a binary vector pBI-35S::GFP that contained the <i>NPT II</i> (neomycin phosphotransferase) gene and the <i>GFP</i> (green fluorescent protein) gene as a fluorescent marker in the T-DNA region. 82.6% explants produced adventitious roots, of which 53% showed GFP expression after transformation. 82% of transformed hairy roots produced embryonic calli, 12% of which regenerated into stable transformed cotton plants after 7 months of culture. The integration of <i>GFP</i> in the transformed cotton genomes were confirmed by PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) and Southern blot analysis as well as the stable expression of GFP were also detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The resultant transformed plantlets were phenotypically, thus avoiding Ri syndrome. Here we report a stable and reproducible method for <i>A. rhizogenes</i>-mediated transformation of <i>cotton</i> using cotyledon as explants, which provides a useful and reliable platform for gene function analysis of cotton.
