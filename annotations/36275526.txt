The soil-borne yellow mosaic virus disease, which is caused by the bymoviruses barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV) and/or barley mild mosaic virus (BaMMV), seriously threatens winter barley production in Europe and East Asia. Both viruses are transmitted by the soil-borne plasmodiophorid <i>Polymyxa graminis</i> and are difficult to eliminate through chemical or physical measures in the field, making breeding for resistant cultivars the optimal strategy for disease control. The resistance locus <i>rym1/11</i> was cloned encoding the host factor gene <i>Protein Disulfide Isomerase Like 5-1</i> (<i>PDIL5-1</i>), whose loss-of-function variants confer broad-spectrum resistance to multiple strains of BaMMV/BaYMV. Most resistance-conferring variants have been identified in six-rowed barley landraces/historic cultivars, and their introgression into modern two-rowed malting cultivars is difficult because <i>PDIL5-1</i> is located in a peri-centromeric region with suppressed recombination. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to modify <i>PDIL5-1</i> in the BaYMV/BaMMV-susceptible elite malting barley cv. 'Golden Promise' and obtained the mutants <i>pdil5-1-a</i> and <i>pdil5-1-b</i>. <i>PDIL5-1</i> in the <i>pdil5-1-a</i> mutant encodes a protein lacking a cysteine residue, and <i>pdil5-1-b</i> contains a protein-coding frameshift. Both mutants were completely resistant to BaYMV. The knockout mutant <i>pdil5-1-b</i> showed complete BaMMV resistance, while <i>pdil5-1-a</i> showed decreased viral accumulation but no disease symptoms if compared to 'Golden Promise'. Both <i>PDIL5-1</i> edited lines, as well as the previously produced EMS-induced <i>pdil5-1</i> mutant '10253-1-5' in the elite malting barley cv. 'Barke' background, displayed no growth or yield penalties in garden experiments or bymovirus-free field trials. Line '10253-1-5' showed improved resistance and yield performance compared to the wild-type and its sibling line when grown in infectious fields. Therefore, genome editing of the host factor gene <i>PDIL5-1</i> could facilitate the breeding of barley varieties with resistance to bymoviruses.
