Germinated plants grow in darkness until they emerge above the soil. To help the seedling penetrate the soil, most dicot seedlings develop an etiolated apical structure consisting of an apical hook and folded, unexpanded cotyledons atop a rapidly elongating hypocotyl. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are necessary for etiolated apical development, but their precise role and mechanisms remain unclear. Arabidopsis thaliana SMALL AUXIN UP RNA17 (SAUR17) is an apical-organ-specific regulator that promotes production of an apical hook and closed cotyledons. In darkness, ethylene and BRs stimulate SAUR17 expression by transcription factor complexes containing PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs), ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3), and its homolog EIN3-LIKE 1 (EIL1), and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 (BZR1). BZR1 requires EIN3 and PIFs for enhanced DNA-binding and transcriptional activation of the SAUR17 promoter; while EIN3, PIF3, and PIF4 stability depends on BR signaling. BZR1 transcriptionally downregulates EIN3-BINDING F-BOX 1 and 2 (EBF1 and EBF2), which encode ubiquitin ligases mediating EIN3 and PIF3 protein degradation. By modulating the EBF-EIN3/PIF protein-stability circuit, BRs induce EIN3 and PIF3 accumulation, which underlies BR-responsive expression of SAUR17 and HOOKLESS1 and ultimately apical hook development. We suggest that in the etiolated development of apical structures, BRs primarily modulate plant sensitivity to darkness and ethylene.
