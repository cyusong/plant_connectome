Stem bending or lodging caused by insufficient stem strength is an important limiting factor for plant production. Secondary cell walls play a crucial role in plant stem strength, but whether WRKY transcription factors can positively modulate secondary cell wall thickness are remain unknown. Here, we characterized a WRKY transcription factor PlWRKY41a from herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora), which was highly expressed in stems. PlWRKY41a functioned as a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator and enhanced stem strength by positively modulating secondary cell wall thickness. Moreover, PlWRKY41a bound to the promoter of the XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE4 (PlXTH4) and activated the expression of PlXTH4. PlXTH4-overexpressing tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) had thicker secondary cell walls, resulting in enhanced stem strength, while PlXTH4-silenced P. lactiflora had thinner secondary cell walls, showing decreased stem strength. Additionally, PlWRKY41a directly interacted with PlMYB43 to form a protein complex, and their interaction induced the expression of PlXTH4. These data support that the PlMYB43-PlWRKY41a protein complex can directly activate the expression of PlXTH4 to enhance stem strength by modulating secondary cell wall thickness in P. lactiflora. The results will enhance our understanding of the formation mechanism of stem strength and provide a candidate gene to improve stem straightness in plants.
