Metalliferous soils are characterized by a high content of metal compounds that can hamper plant growth. The pseudometallophyte <i>Noccaea caerulescens</i> is able to grow on metalliferous substrates by implementing both tolerance and accumulation of usually toxic metal ions. Expression of particular transmembrane transporter proteins (e.g., members of the ZIP and NRAMP families) leads to metal tolerance and accumulation, and its comparison between hyperaccumulator <i>N. caerulescens</i> with non-accumulator relatives <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Thlaspi arvense</i> has deepened our knowledge on mechanisms adopted by plants to survive in metalliferous soils. In this work, two transporters, <i>ZNT1</i> and <i>NRAMP4,</i> expressed in a serpentinic population of <i>N. caerulescens</i> identified on the Monte Prinzera (Italy) are considered, and their expression has been induced in yeast and in <i>A. thaliana</i>. In the latter, single transgenic lines were crossed to test the effect of the combined over-expression of the two transporters. An enhanced iron and manganese translocation towards the shoot was induced by overexpression of <i>NcZNT1</i>. The combined overexpression of <i>NcZNT1</i> and <i>NcNRAMP4</i> did perturb the metal accumulation in plants.
