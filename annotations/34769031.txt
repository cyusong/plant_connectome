Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) are the most important proteins in mitochondria. They localize to the outer mitochondrial membrane and contribute to the metabolite transport between the mitochondria and cytoplasm, which aids plant growth regulation. Here, we report that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> VDAC1 is involved in the floral transition, with the loss of <i>AtVDAC1</i> function, resulting in an early-flowering phenotype. <i>AtVDAC1</i> is expressed ubiquitously in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. To identify the flowering pathway integrators that may be responsible for AtVDAC1's function during the floral transition, an RNA-seq analysis was performed. In total, 106 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between wild-type and <i>atvdac1-5</i> mutant seedlings. However, none were involved in flowering-related pathways. In contrast, AtVDAC1 physically associated with FLOWERING LOCUS T. Thus, in the floral transition, AtVDAC1 may function partly through the FLOWERING LOCUS T protein.
