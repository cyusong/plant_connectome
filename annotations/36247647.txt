Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are obligate symbionts that transfer mineral nutrients to host plants through arbuscules, a fungal structure specialized for exchange for photosynthetic products. <i>MtNF-YC6</i> and <i>MtNF-YC11</i>, which encode the C subunits of nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> are induced specifically by arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS). A previous study showed that <i>MtNF-YC6</i> and <i>MtNF-YC11</i> are activated in cortical cells of mycorrhizal roots, but the gene functions were unknown. Herein, we identified both MtNF-YB17 and MtNF-YB12 as the interacting partners of MtNF-YC6 and MtNF-YC11 in yeast and plants. <i>MtNF-YB17</i> was highly induced by AMS and activated in cortical cells only in mycorrhizal roots but <i>MtNF-YB12</i> was not affected. The formation of B/C heterodimers led the protein complexes to transfer from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Silencing <i>MtNF-YC6</i> and <i>C11</i> by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in decreased colonization efficiency and arbuscule richness. Coincidently, genes associated with arbuscule development and degeneration in RNAi roots were also downregulated. <i>In silico</i> analysis showed CCAAT-binding motifs in the promoter regions of downregulated genes, further supporting the involvement of NF-Y complexes in transcriptional regulation of symbiosis. Taken together, this study identifies MtNF-YC6- or MtNF-YC11-containing protein complexes as novel transcriptional regulators of symbiotic program and provides a list of potential downstream target genes. These data will help to further dissect the AMS regulatory network.
