Leguminous plants develop root nodules in symbiosis with soil rhizobia. Nodule formation occurs following rhizobial infection of the host root that induces dedifferentiation of some cortical cells and the initiation of a new developmental program to form nodule primordia. In a recent study, we identified a novel gene, TRICOT (TCO), that acts as a positive regulator of nodulation in Lotus japonicus. In addition to its role in nodulation, tco mutant plants display pleiotropic defects including abnormal shoot apical meristem formation. Here, we investigated the effect of the tco mutation on nodulation using a grafting approach. The results strongly indicate that the nodulation-deficient phenotype of the mutant results from malfunction of the TCO gene in the root.
