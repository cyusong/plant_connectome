Roots anchor plants to the soil, providing them with nutrients and water while creating a defence network and facilitating beneficial interactions with a multitude of living organisms and climatological conditions. To facilitate morphological and molecular studies, root research has been conducted using in vitro systems. However, under natural conditions, roots grow in the dark, mainly in the absence of illumination, except for the relatively low illumination of the upper soil surface, and this has been largely ignored. Here, we discuss the results found over the last decade on how experimental exposure of roots to light may bias root development and responses through the alteration of hormonal signalling, cytoskeleton organization, reactive oxygen species or the accumulation of flavonoids, among other factors. Illumination alters the uptake of nutrients or water, and also affects the response of the roots to abiotic stresses and root interactions with the microbiota. Furthermore, we review in vitro systems created to maintain roots in darkness, and provide a comparative analysis of root transcriptomes obtained with these devices. Finally, we identify other experimental variables that should be considered to better mimic soil conditions, whose improvement would benefit studies using in vitro cultivation or enclosed ecosystems.
