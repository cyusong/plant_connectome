Sulfur deficiency in plant cells has not been considered as a potential abiotic factor that can induce oxidative stress. We studied the antioxidant defense system of Chlorella sorokiniana cultured under sulfur (S) deficiency, imposed for a maximum period of 24 h, to evaluate the effect of an S shortage on oxidative stress. S deprivation induced an immediate (30 min) but transient increase in the intracellular H2O2 content, which suggests that S limitation can lead to a temporary redox disturbance. After 24 h, S deficiency in Chlorella cells decreased the glutathione content to <10% of the value measured in cells that were not subjected to S deprivation. Consequently, we assumed that the cellular antioxidative mechanisms could be altered by a decrease in the total glutathione content. The total ascorbate pool increased within 2 h after the initiation of S depletion, and remained high until 6 h; however, ascorbate regeneration was inhibited under limited S conditions, indicated by a significant decrease in the ascorbate/dehydroascorbate (AsA/DHA) ratios. Furthermore, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were activated under S deficiency, but we assumed that these enzymes were involved in maintaining the cellular H2O2 balance for at least 4 h after the initiation of S starvation. We concluded that S deprivation triggers redox changes and induces antioxidant enzyme activities in Chlorella cells. The accumulation of total ascorbate, changes in the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratios and an increase in the activity of SOD and APX enzymes indicate that oxidative perturbation occurs during S deprivation.
