SignificanceTo adapt to arboreal lifestyles, treefrogs have evolved a suite of complex traits that support vertical movement and gliding, thus presenting a unique case for studying the genetic basis for traits causally linked to vertical niche expansion. Here, based on two de novo-assembled Asian treefrog genomes, we determined that genes involved in limb development and keratin cytoskeleton likely played a role in the evolution of their climbing systems. Behavioral and morphological evaluation and time-ordered gene coexpression network analysis revealed the developmental patterns and regulatory pathways of the webbed feet used for gliding in <i>Rhacophorus kio</i>.
