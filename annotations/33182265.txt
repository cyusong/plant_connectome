Soil salinization and a degraded ecological environment are challenging agricultural productivity and food security. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the staple food of much of the world's population, is categorized as a salt-susceptible crop. Improving the salt tolerance of rice would increase the potential of saline-alkali land and ensure food security. Salt tolerance is a complex quantitative trait. Biotechnological efforts to improve the salt tolerance of rice hinge on a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying salt stress tolerance. In this review, we summarize progress in the breeding of salt-tolerant rice and in the mapping and cloning of genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with salt tolerance in rice. Furthermore, we describe biotechnological tools that can be used to cultivate salt-tolerant rice, providing a reference for efforts aimed at rapidly and precisely cultivating salt-tolerance rice varieties.
