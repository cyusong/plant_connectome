Live and deep imaging play a significant role in the physiological and biological study of organisms. Two-photon excitation microscopy (2PEM), also known as multiphoton excitation microscopy, is a fluorescent imaging technique that allows deep imaging of living tissues. Two-photon lasers use near-infrared (NIR) pulse lasers that are less invasive and permit deep tissue penetration. In this review, recent advances in two-photon imaging and their applications in plant studies are discussed. Compared to confocal microscopy, NIR 2PEM exhibits reduced plant-specific autofluorescence, thereby achieving greater depth and high-resolution imaging in plant tissues. Fluorescent proteins with long emission wavelengths, such as orange-red fluorescent proteins, are particularly suitable for two-photon live imaging in plants. Furthermore, deep- and high-resolution imaging was achieved using plant-specific clearing methods. In addition to imaging, optical cell manipulations can be performed using femtosecond pulsed lasers at the single cell or organelle level. Optical surgery and manipulation can reveal cellular communication during development. Advances in in vivo imaging using 2PEM will greatly benefit biological studies in plant sciences.
