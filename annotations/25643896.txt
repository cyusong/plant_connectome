With increasing winter temperatures, Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) is expected to become an increasing problem in maize cultivation in Germany. Earlier studies revealed that BYDV has a negative impact on maize performance. Molecular markers would accelerate the development of BYDV resistant maize. Therefore, the objectives of this study were (i) the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for BYDV resistance in five connected segregating maize populations in a field experiment and (ii) their comparison with the QTL detected under greenhouse conditions. In linkage analyses of the traits virus extinction, infection rate, and the symptom red edges, a highly associated major QTL was identified on chromosome 10. This QTL explained 45% of the phenotypic variance for the traits virus extinction and infection rate and 30% for the symptom red edges. We could show that BYDV resistance traits are oligogenically inherited. The QTL on chromosome 10 could be observed in the connected linkage analyses and in the single population analyses. Furthermore, this QTL could also be confirmed in the greenhouse experiment. Our results let suggest that this QTL is involved in multiple virus resistance and the markers are promising for marker assisted selection.
