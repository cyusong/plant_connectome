RNA-seq analysis of a transgenic tobacco plant, i-hpHSP90C, in which chloroplast HSP90C genes can be silenced in an artificially inducible manner resulting in the development of chlorosis, revealed the up- and downregulation of 2746 and 3490 genes, respectively. Gene ontology analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated the upregulation of ROS-responsive genes; the activation of the innate immunity and cell death pathways; and the downregulation of genes involved in photosynthesis, plastid organization, and cell cycle. Cell death was confirmed by trypan blue staining and electrolyte leakage assay, and the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production was confirmed by diaminobenzidine staining. The results collectively suggest that the reduced levels of HSP90C chaperone lead the plant to develop chlorosis primarily through the global downregulation of chloroplast- and photosynthesis-related genes and additionally through the light-dependent production of ROS, followed by the activation of immune responses, including cell death.
