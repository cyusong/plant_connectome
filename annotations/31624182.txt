Bastin <i>et al</i>'s estimate (Reports, 5 July 2019, p. 76) that tree planting for climate change mitigation could sequester 205 gigatonnes of carbon is approximately five times too large. Their analysis inflated soil organic carbon gains, failed to safeguard against warming from trees at high latitudes and elevations, and considered afforestation of savannas, grasslands, and shrublands to be restoration.

Tree planting: !inflates! Soil organic carbon gains
Tree planting: !fails to safeguard against! Warming from trees at high latitudes and elevations
Tree planting: !considers! Afforestation of savannas, grasslands, and shrublands as restoration
