From the perspective of wheat yield improvement, the coleoptile is vital for successful crop establishment, and long coleoptile lengths (CLs) are preferred in wheat-growing regions where deep planting is practiced. To determine the genetic basis of CL, we performed a genome-wide association study on a set of 707 Chinese wheat landraces using 18,594 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 38,678 diversity array technology sequencing markers. We accordingly detected a total of 29 significant markers [-log<sub>10</sub> <sup>(P)</sup> > 4.76] distributed on chromosomes 2B, 2D, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 6B, 6D, and 7B. Based on linkage disequilibrium decay distance, we identified a total of 17 quantitative trait loci associated with CL, among which <i>QCl.sicau-6B.2</i>, located at 508.17-509.26 Mb on chromosome 6B, was recognized as a novel major locus. We subsequently developed a high-resolution melt marker for <i>QCl.sicau-6B.2</i>, which was validated in an <i>F</i> <sub>2</sub> <sub>:</sub> <sub>3</sub> population. Our findings provide important insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying coleoptile growth and could be applied to marker-assisted wheat selection.
