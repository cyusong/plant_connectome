In the present paper, we based a search for candidates underlying different levels of salinity tolerance during germination in the Oregon Wolfe Barley mapping population (DOM x REC) by proteomic profiling of the mature grain of lines showing differing levels of salinity tolerance. By contrasting the parents DOM and REC, displaying divergent stress responses, and two tolerant and two sensitive segregants, six protein spots were identified that showed a differential abundance between the tolerant and the sensitive lines. The tolerant lines expressed a higher level of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and glucose/ribitol dehydrogenase (Glc/RibDH). Both proteins were heterologously over-expressed in an osmo-sensitive yeast strain and over-expression of Glc/RibDH resulted in an enhanced ability of yeast transformants to grow on salt containing media. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of the population germinating at different salt concentrations led to the identification of two chromosome regions on 5H and one on 7H associated with salt stress response. A dense barley transcript map was employed to map the genomic region of all identified proteins. Two of these, heat-shock protein 70 and Glc/RibDH, co-localized with the identified QTL on chromosome 5H. The putative functional role of the candidates is discussed.
