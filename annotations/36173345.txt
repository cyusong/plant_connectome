Regulation of seed germination is important for plant survival and propagation. ABSCISIC ACID (ABA) INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5), the central transcription factor in the ABA signaling pathway, plays a fundamental role in the regulation of ABA-responsive gene expression during seed germination; however, how ABI5 transcriptional activation activity is regulated remains to be elucidated. Here, we report that C-type Cyclin1;1 (CycC1;1) is an ABI5-interacting partner affecting the ABA response and seed germination in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The CycC1;1 loss-of-function mutant is hypersensitive to ABA, and this phenotype was rescued by mutation of ABI5. Moreover, CycC1;1 suppresses ABI5 transcriptional activation activity for ABI5-targeted genes including ABI5 itself by occupying their promoters and disrupting RNA polymerase II recruitment; thus the cycc1;1 mutant shows increased expression of ABI5 and genes downstream of ABI5. Furthermore, ABA reduces the interaction between CycC1;1 and ABI5, while phospho-mimic but not phospho-dead mutation of serine-42 in ABI5 abolishes CycC1;1 interaction with ABI5 and relieves CycC1;1 inhibition of ABI5-mediated transcriptional activation of downstream target genes. Together, our study illustrates that CycC1;1 negatively modulates the ABA response by interacting with and inhibiting ABI5, while ABA relieves the CycC1;1 interaction with and inhibition of ABI5 to activate ABI5 activity for the ABA response, thereby inhibiting seed germination.
