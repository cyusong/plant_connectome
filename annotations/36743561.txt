Cotton is one of the most important crops in the world. GDSL-type esterases/lipases (GELPs) are widely present in all kingdoms and play an essential role in regulating plant growth, development, and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this functional diversity remain unclear. Here, based on the identification of the <i>GELP</i> gene family, we applied genetic evolution and molecular simulation techniques to explore molecular mechanisms in cotton species. A total of 1502 <i>GELP</i> genes were identified in 10 cotton species. Segmental duplication and differences in evolutionary rates are the leading causes of the increase in the number and diversity of <i>GELP</i> genes during evolution for ecological adaptation. Structural analysis revealed that the GELP family has high structural diversity. Moreover, molecular simulation studies have demonstrated significant differences in the properties of the binding pockets among cotton GELPs. In the process of adapting to the environment, GELPs not only have segmental duplication but also have different evolutionary rates, resulting in gene diversity. This diversity leads to significant differences in the 3D structure and binding pocket properties and, finally, to functional diversity. These findings provide a reference for further functional analyses of plant GELPs.
