Several nitrogen compounds were identified and quantified in the apoplastic and symplastic sap of sugarcane stems. The sap of stems was composed mainly of soluble sugars, which constituted 95% of the total organic compounds detected. Sap also contained nitrogen compounds, with amino acids (50-70% of N) and proteins (20-30% of N), being the main nitrogenous substances, as well as inorganic forms as ammonium, nitrite and nitrate, in low concentrations (<20% of N). Serine, proline, alanine and aspartic acid together represented around 60% of the amino acids of the sap of both field grown and high nitrogen fertilized plants, and non-nitrogen fertilized plants inoculated with Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus. The total amino acid content of apoplastic sap was six to nine times lower in non-nitrogen fertilized plants than in fertilized ones. The possible roles of these substances to regulate endophytic associations with sugarcane are also discussed.
