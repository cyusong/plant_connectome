Root-associated bacteria strongly affect plant growth and development by synthesizing growth regulators and stress-relieving metabolites. The present study is mainly focused on assessing aerial root-associated bacteria of <i>Rhynchostylis retusa</i> (L.) Blume is an endemic epiphytic orchid responsible for auxin production and influencing plant growth. A bacterial isolate, <i>Microbacterium testaceum</i> Y411, was found to be the most active producer of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The maximum IAA production (170µg/mL) was recorded with the bacterium at optimum process parameters such as pH 7, temperature 30°C, and tryptophan 1000 µg/mL in a culture medium for 48 h. The extracted auxin was purified and analyzed by FT-IR, HPLC, and HR-MS, indicating bacterial auxin has a similar mass value to 4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid auxin. Furthermore, the bacterial auxin was tested on <i>in vitro</i> propagation of orchid, <i>Cymbidium aloifolium</i>, and 90% seed germination was recorded in Murashige and Skoog's medium supplemented with bacterial auxin. The novel results obtained in this study are used for agricultural applications and the <i>Microbacterium testaceum</i> Y411 is a valuable biotechnological resource for a natural auxin.
