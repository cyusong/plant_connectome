['35519820', 'Secreted peptide-mediated cell-to-cell communication plays a crucial role in the  development of multicellular organisms. A large number of secreted peptides have  been predicated by bioinformatic approaches in plants. However, only a few of  them have been functionally characterized. In this study, we show that two  CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED (CLE) peptides CLE16/17 are required  for both stem cell differentiation and lateral root (LR) emergence in  Arabidopsis. We further demonstrate that the CLE16/17 peptides act through the  CLAVATA1-ARABIDOPSIS CRINKLY4 (CLV1-ACR4) protein kinase complex in columella  stem cell (CSC) differentiation, but not in LR emergence. Furthermore, we show  that CLE16/17 promote LR emergence probably via activating the expression of  HAESA/HAESA-LIKE2 (HAE/HSL2) required for cell wall remodeling. Collectively, our  results reveal a CLV1-ACR4-dependent and -independent dual-function of the  CLE16/17 peptides in root development.', '2022', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2022.869888', 'Pi']
