['27021284', 'Chlorophyll (Chl) degradation occurs during leaf senescence, embryo degreening,  bud breaking, and fruit ripening. The Chl catabolic pathway has been intensively  studied and nearly all the enzymes involved are identified and characterized;  however, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of this pathway are largely unknown.  In this study, we performed yeast one-hybrid screening using a transcription  factor cDNA library to search for factors controlling the expression of Chl  catabolic genes. We identified ANAC046 as a common regulator that directly binds  to the promoter regions of NON-YELLOW COLORING1, STAY-GREEN1 (SGR1), SGR2, and  PHEOPHORBIDE a OXYGENASE. Transgenic plants overexpressing ANAC046 exhibited an  early-senescence phenotype and a lower Chl content in comparison with the  wild-type plants, whereas loss-of-function mutants exhibited a delayed-senescence  phenotype and a higher Chl content. Microarray analysis of ANAC046 transgenic  plants showed that not only Chl catabolic genes but also senescence-associated  genes were positively regulated by ANAC046. We conclude that ANAC046 is a  positive regulator of Arabidopsis leaf senescence and exerts its effect by  controlling the expression of Chl catabolic genes and senescence-associated  genes.', '2016 Mar 29', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep23609', 'Ohmiya']
