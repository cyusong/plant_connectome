Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a highly Al-resistant species among small grain crops, but the mechanism responsible for the high Al resistance has not been elucidated. In this study, rice mutants sensitive to Al were isolated from M(3) lines derived from an Al-resistant cultivar, Koshihikari, irradiated with gamma-rays. Relative root elongation was used as a parameter for evaluating Al resistance. After initial screening plus two rounds of confirmatory testing, a mutant (als1) was isolated from a total of 560 lines. This mutant showed a phenotype similar to the wild-type plant in the absence of Al. However, in the presence of 10 microM Al, root elongation was inhibited 70% in the mutant, but only 8% in the wild-type plant. The mutant also showed poorer root growth in acid soil. The Al content of root apices (0-1 cm) was much lower in the wild-type plant. The sensitivity to other metals including Cd and La did not differ between the mutant and the wild-type plants. A small amount of citrate was secreted from the roots of the mutant in response to Al stress, but there was no difference from that secreted by the wild-type plant. Genetic analysis of F(2) populations between als1 and wild-type plants showed that the Al-resistant seedlings and Al-sensitive seedlings segregated at a 3 : 1 ratio, indicating that the high sensitivity to Al in als1 is controlled by a single recessive gene. The gene was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6, flanked by InDel markers MaOs0619 and MaOs0615.
