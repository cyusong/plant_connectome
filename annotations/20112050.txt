Strigolactones have recently been identified as the long sought-after signal required to inhibit shoot branching (Gomez-Roldan et al. 2008; Umehara et al. 2008; reviewed in Dun et al. 2009). Here we briefly describe the evidence for strigolactone inhibition of shoot branching and, more extensively, the broader context of this action. We address the central question of why strigolactone mutants exhibit a varied branching phenotype across a wide range of experimental conditions. Where knowledge is available, we highlight the role of other hormones in dictating these phenotypes and describe those instances where our knowledge of known plant hormones and their interactions falls considerably short of explaining the phenotypes. This review will focus on bud outgrowth in herbaceous species because knowledge on the role of strigolactones in shoot branching to date barely extends beyond this group of plants.
