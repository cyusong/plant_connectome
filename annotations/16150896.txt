We examined the acid-facilitated yielding properties of cell walls of soybean hypocotyls and the effects of Ca(2+) upon the properties by stress-strain analyses using glycerinated hollow cylinders (GHCs) from the elongating regions of the hypocotyls. Stress-extension rate curves of native GHCs showed characteristic changes with pH, all indicating the existence of yield threshold tension (y) as well as wall extensibility (phi), i.e. a downward shift of y and an increase in phi with wall acidification. The acid-induced downward shift of y was inhibited by boiling of GHCs. In contrast, a considerable increase in phi with acidification remained even after boiling. This indicates that phi consists of two components, i.e. heat-sensitive and heat-resistant, both being pH sensitive. A Ca(2+) chelator (Quin 2) dramatically increased phi at a neutral pH. Subsequent addition of Ca(2+) or ruthenium red suppressed the chelator-induced increase in phi. These findings suggest that wall Ca(2+) plays an important role in the regulation of wall extensibility during the acid-induced wall extension by reacting with carboxyl groups of wall pectin.
