['21756272', 'Botrytis cinerea is a major pre- and post-harvest necrotrophic pathogen with a  broad host range that causes substantial crop losses. The plant hormone jasmonic  acid (JA) is involved in the basal resistance against this fungus. Despite basal  resistance, virulent strains of B. cinerea can cause disease on Arabidopsis  thaliana and virulent pathogens can interfere with the metabolism of the host in  a way to facilitate infection of the plant. However, plant genes that are  required by the pathogen for infection remain poorly described. To find such  genes, we have compared the changes in gene expression induced in A. thaliana by  JA with those induced after B. cinerea using genome-wide microarrays. We have  identified genes that are repressed by JA but that are induced by B. cinerea. In  this study, we describe one candidate gene, ATGRXS13, that encodes for a putative  glutaredoxin and that exhibits such a crossed expression. In plants that are  infected by this necrotrophic fungus, ATGRXS13 expression was negatively  controlled by JA and TGA transcription factors but also through a JA-salicylic  acid (SA) cross-talk mechanism as B. cinerea induced SA production that  positively controlled ATGRXS13 expression. Furthermore, plants impaired in  ATGRXS13 exhibited resistance to B. cinerea. Finally, we present a model whereby  B. cinerea takes advantage of defence signalling pathways of the plant to help  the colonization of its host.', '2011 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04706.x', 'Lamotte']
