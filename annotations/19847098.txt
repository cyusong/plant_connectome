During the early stages of Arabidopsis seed development, the endosperm is syncytial and proliferates rapidly through multiple rounds of mitosis in the absence of cytokinesis and cell wall formation. This stage of endosperm development is important in determining seed viability and size. To identify genes involved in syncytial endosperm development, we analyzed the endosperm transcriptome, obtained using laser capture microdissection of developing seeds at four days after pollination. Our results support the idea that similar sets of genes are required for conventional somatic mitosis with cytokinesis and syncytial proliferation. Furthermore, we identify cytoskeleton associated genes that may act to facilitate syncytial development thereby providing an important resource for further characterization of the processes involved in syncytial endosperm development.
