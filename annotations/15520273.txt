['15520273', 'The winter-annual habit (which typically involves a requirement for exposure to  the cold of winter to flower in the spring) in Arabidopsis thaliana is mainly due  to the repression of flowering by relatively high levels of FLC expression.  Exposure to prolonged cold attenuates FLC expression through a process known as  vernalization and thus permits flowering to occur in the spring. Here we show  that the elevated FLC expression characteristic of nonvernalized winter annuals  requires two genes, EARLY FLOWERING 7 (ELF7) and EARLY FLOWERING 8 (ELF8), that  are homologs of components of the PAF1 complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Furthermore, ELF7 and ELF8 are also required for the expression of other genes in  the FLC clade of flowering repressors such as MAF2 and FLM. FLC, FLM, and MAF2  are involved in multiple flowering pathways that account for the broad effects of  elf7 and elf8 mutations on flowering behavior. ELF7 and ELF8 are required for the  enhancement of histone 3 trimethylation at Lys 4 in FLC chromatin. This  modification of FLC chromatin appears to be required to elevate FLC expression to  levels that can delay flowering in plants that have not been vernalized. A model  of the role of ELF7, ELF8, and other previously described genes in the  modification of the chromatin of flowering repressors is presented.', '2004 Nov 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1244504', 'Amasino']
