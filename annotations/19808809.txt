Oligopeptide transporters (OPTs) are found in fungi, bacteria and plants. The nine Arabidopsis thaliana OPT genes are expressed mainly in the vasculature and are thought to transport tetra- and pentapeptides, and peptide-like substrates such as glutathione. Expression of AtOPT6 in Xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrated that AtOPT6 transports many tetra- and pentapeptides. In addition, AtOPT6 transported reduced glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide, but not oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Recent data showed that Candida albicans OPTs can transport peptides up to eight amino acids in length. AtOPT6 transported mammalian signaling peptides up to 10 amino acids in length and, in addition, known plant development- and nematode pathogenesis-associated peptides up to 13 amino acids long. AtOPT6 displayed high affinity for penta- and dodecapeptides, but low affinity for GSH. In comparison the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ScOPT1 was incapable of transporting any of the longer peptides tested. These data demonstrate the necessity of experimentally determining substrate specificity of individual OPTs, and lay a foundation for structure/function studies. Characterization of the AtOPT6 substrate range provides a basis for investigating the possible physiological function of AtOPT6 in peptide signaling and thiol transport in response to stress.
