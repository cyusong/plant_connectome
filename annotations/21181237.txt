An international workshop on ''Induction and Suppression of RNA Silencing: Insights from Plant Viral Infections'' was sponsored by the United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD) and organized in Eilat, Israel in March 2010. The focus of this workshop was on molecular mechanisms employed by viruses or their hosts, and their interactions, for the regulation of virus-induced silencing and suppression. Several of the talks also served as potent reminders of scientific hubris and the need to be attentive to earlier results, both for analyses and perspective regarding new findings.

Virus: !induces! RNA Silencing 
Host: !suppresses! RNA Silencing 
Virus: !interacts with! Host 
Virus: !regulates! Virus-induced Silencing 
Scientific Hubris: !reminds of! Need to be Attentive
