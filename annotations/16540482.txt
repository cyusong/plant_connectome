UPF1 RNA helicase plays a central role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which specifically recognizes aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination codons and targets them for degradation. Although NMD factors are highly conserved among eukaryotes, little is known about the role of NMD in plant growth and development. The lba1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana with a Gly(851)-->Glu missense mutation in AtUPF1 yielded seeds that were on average 22% longer in the long axis and 35% heavier than the wild-type Col seeds. Expression of the wild-type AtUPF1 in this mutant reduced the seeds to a normal size. During early stages of seed development, globular to torpedo stages of the embryos were contained within seed sacs that were larger in lba1 than in Col. Furthermore, the distance between seeds in siliques was greater in lba1 than in Col, suggesting that the lba1 mutation may affect ovule development. Self-pollinated atupf1-3(+/-) plants heterozygous for AtUPF1 disrupted by T-DNA insertion developed atupf1-3(-/-) seeds with a size and shape similar to those of Col seeds. However, the atupf1-3(-/-) seedlings stopped growing after radicle emergence from the seed coat, and this seedling lethality was rescued by expressing the wild-type AtUPF1. These results suggest that the lba1 mutation in AtUPF1 maternally affects seed development and that AtUPF1 is essential for seedling growth.
