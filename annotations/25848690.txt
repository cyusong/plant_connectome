Sec18p/N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) is a conserved eukaryotic ATPase, which primarily functions in vesicle membrane fusion from yeast to human. However, the function of the OsSec18 gene, a homologue of NSF in rice, remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the function of OsSec18 in rice and found that OsSec18 complements the temperature-sensitive phenotype and interferes with vacuolar morphogenesis in yeast. Overexpression of OsSec18 in rice decreased the plant height and 1000-grain weight and altered the morphology of the protein bodies. Further examination revealed that OsSec18 presented as a 290-kDa complex in rice endosperm cells. Moreover, Os60sP0 was identified a component of this complex, demonstrating that the OsSec18 complex contains another complex of P0(P1-P2)2 in rice endosperm cells. Furthermore, we determined that the N-terminus of OsSec18 can interact with the N- and C-termini of Os60sP0, whereas the C-terminus of OsSec18 can only interact with the C-terminus of Os60sP0. Our results revealed that the OsSec18 regulates vacuolar morphology in both yeast and rice endosperm cell and the OsSec18 interacts with P0(P1-P2)2 complex in rice endosperm cell.
