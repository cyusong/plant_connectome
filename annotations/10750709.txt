['10750709', 'When mutations in CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1) and CUC2 are combined, severe  defects involving fusion of sepals and of stamens occur in Arabidopsis flowers.  In addition, septa of gynoecia do not fuse along the length of the ovaries and  many ovules have their growth arrested. CUC2 is expressed at the tips of septal  primordia during gynoecium development and at the boundary between nucellus and  chalaza during ovule development. These expression patterns are partially  consistent with the phenotype of the mutant gynoecium. CUC2 mRNA is also shown to  be expressed at the boundaries between meristems and organ primordia during both  the vegetative and reproductive phases. This expression pattern indicates that  CUC2 is generally involved in organ separation in shoot and floral meristems.', '2000 Jan', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/41.1.60', 'Tasaka']
