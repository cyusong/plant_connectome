Plant molecular farming, that is, using plants as hosts for production of therapeutic proteins and high-value compounds, has gained substantial interest in recent years. Chloroplasts in particular are an attractive subcellular compartment for expression of foreign genes. Here, we present a new method for transgene introduction and expression in chloroplasts that, unlike classically used approaches, does not require transgene insertion into the chloroplast genome. Instead, the transgene is amplified as a physically independent entity termed a 'minichromosome'. Amplification occurs in the presence of a helper protein that initiates the replication process via recognition of specific sequences flanking the transgene, resulting in accumulation of extremely high levels of transgene DNA. Importantly, we demonstrate that such amplified transgenes serve as a template for foreign protein expression, are maintained stably during plant development and are maternally transmitted to the progeny. These findings indicate that the minichromosome-based approach is an attractive tool for transgene expression in chloroplasts and for organelle genome engineering.
