Two novel rice cold shock domain (CSD) proteins were cloned and characterized under different stress treatments and during various stages of development. OsCSP1 and OsCSP2 (Oryza sativa CSD protein) encode putative proteins consisting of an N-terminal CSD and glycine-rich regions that are interspersed by 4 and 2 CX(2)CX(4)HX(4)C (CCHC) retroviral-like zinc fingers, respectively. In vivo functional analysis confirmed that OsCSPs can complement a cold-sensitive bacterial strain which lacks four endogenous cold shock proteins. In vitro ssDNA binding assays determined that recombinant OsCSPs are capable of functioning as nucleic acid-binding proteins. Both OsCSP transcripts are transiently up-regulated in response to low-temperature stress and rapidly return to a basal level of gene expression. Protein blot analysis determined that OsCSPs are maintained at a constant level subsequent to a cold treatment lasting over a period of several days. Both the transcript and protein data are in sharp contrast to those previously obtained for winter wheat WCSP1. A time-coursed study through various stages of rice development confirmed that both OsCSP proteins and transcripts are highly accumulated in reproductive tissues and tissues which exhibit meristematic activity.

OsCSP1: !complements! cold-sensitive bacterial strain
OsCSPs: !bind! ssDNA
OsCSPs: !up-regulate! in response to low-temperature stress
OsCSPs: !maintain constant level! after cold treatment
OsCSP proteins/transcripts: !accumulate! in reproductive tissues/tissues with meristematic activity
