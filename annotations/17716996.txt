Linolenic acid (18:3) is the most abundant fatty acid in plant membrane lipids and is a source for various oxidized metabolites, called oxylipins. 18:3 and oxylipins play important roles in the induction of defense responses to pathogen infection and wound stress in Arabidopsis. However, in rice, endogenous roles for 18:3 and oxylipins in disease resistance have not been confirmed. We generated 18:3-deficient transgenic rice plants (F78Ri) with co-suppression of two omega-3 fatty acid desaturases, OsFAD7 and OsFAD8. that synthesize 18:3. The F78Ri plants showed enhanced resistance to the phytopathogenic fungus Magnaporthe grisea. A typical 18:3-derived oxylipin, jasmonic acid (JA), acts as a signaling molecule in defense responses to fungal infection in Arabidopsis. However, in F78Ri plants, the expression of JA-responsive pathogenesis-related genes, PBZ1 and PR1b, was induced after inoculation with M. grisea, although the JA-mediated wound response was suppressed. Furthermore, the application of JA methyl ester had no significant effect on the enhanced resistance in F78Ri plants. Taken together, our results indicate that, although suppression of fatty acid desaturases involves the concerted action of varied oxylipins via diverse metabolic pathways, 18:3 or 18:3-derived oxylipins, except for JA, may contribute to signaling on defense responses of rice to M. grisea infection.
