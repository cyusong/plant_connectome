NADPH is an essential cofactor in many physiological processes. Fruit ripening is caused by multiple biochemical pathways in which, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) metabolism is involved. Previous studies have demonstrated the differential modulation of nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub> S) content during sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) fruit ripening, both of which regulate NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. To gain a deeper understanding of the potential functions of other NADPH-generating components, we analyzed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), which are involved in the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway (OxPPP) and NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME). During fruit ripening, G6PDH activity diminished by 38%, while 6PGDH and NADP-ME activity increased 1.5- and 2.6-fold, respectively. To better understand the potential regulation of these NADP-dehydrogenases by H<sub>2</sub> S, we obtained a 50-75% ammonium-sulfate-enriched protein fraction containing these proteins. With the aid of in vitro assays, in the presence of H<sub>2</sub> S, we observed that, while NADP-ME activity was inhibited by up to 29-32% using 2 and 5 mM Na<sub>2</sub> S as H<sub>2</sub> S donor, G6PDH and 6PGDH activities were unaffected. On the other hand, NO donors, S-nitrosocyteine (CysNO) and DETA NONOate also inhibited NADP-ME activity by 35%. These findings suggest that both NADP-ME and 6PGDH play an important role in maintaining the supply of NADPH during pepper fruit ripening and that H<sub>2</sub> S and NO partially modulate the NADPH-generating system.
