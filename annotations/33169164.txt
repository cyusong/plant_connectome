Plant plasma membrane-type plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) aquaporins are classified into two groups, PIP1s and PIP2s. In this study, we focused on HvPIP1;2, a PIP1 in barley (Hordeum vulgare), to dissect the molecular mechanisms that evoke HvPIP1-mediated water transport. No HvPIP1;2 protein was localized to the plasma membrane when expressed alone in Xenopus laevis oocytes. By contrast, a chimeric HvPIP1;2 protein (HvPIP1;2_24NC), in which the N- and C-terminal regions were replaced with the corresponding regions from HvPIP2;4, was found to localize to the plasma membrane of oocytes. However, HvPIP1;2_24NC showed no water transport activity in swelling assays. These results suggested that the terminal regions of PIP2 proteins direct PIP proteins to the plasma membrane, but the relocalization of PIP1 proteins was not sufficient to PIP1s functionality as a water channel in a membrane. A single amino acid replacement of threonine by methionine in HvPIP2;4 (HvPIP2;4T229M) abolished water transport activity. Co-expression of HvPIP1;2_24NC either with HvPIP2;4_12NC or with HvPIP2;4TM_12NC, in which the N- and C-terminal regions were replaced with the corresponding regions of HvPIP1;2, increased the water transport activity in oocytes. These data provided evidence that the HvPIP1;2 molecule has own water transport activity and an interaction with the middle part of the HvPIP2;4 protein (except for the N- and C-termini) is required for HvPIP1;2 functionality as a water channel. This molecular mechanism could be applied to other PIP1s and PIP2s in addition to the known mechanism that the terminal regions of some PIP2s lead some PIP1s to the plasma membrane.
