Arabidopsis thaliana Cell Growth Defect factor 1 (Cdf1) has been implicated in promotion of proapoptotic Bax-like cell death via the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we report a conserved function of a chloroplast-targeting Cdf-related gene Responsive to Senescence (CRS) using CRS overexpression and loss of function in plants as well as CRS heterologous expression in yeast. CRS expression was strongly induced in senescent leaves, suggesting its main functions during plant senescence. CRS expression in yeast mitochondria increased the ROS level and led to cell death in a manner similar to Cdf1. In whole plants, overexpression of CRS caused the loss of chlorophylls (Chls) and the rapid onset of leaf senescence, while the lack of CRS led to the delay of leaf senescence in a loss-of-function mutant, crs. The higher and lower accumulation of H(2)O(2) was correlated with early and late senescence in CRS-overexpressing and crs mutant plants, respectively. Furthermore, expression of senescence-related marker genes and metacaspase genes was induced in CRS-overexpressing plants in response to dark. Our findings suggest that CRS plays a key role in the leaf senescence process that accompanies H(2)O(2) accumulation resulting in cell death promotion.
