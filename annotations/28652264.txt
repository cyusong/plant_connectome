['28652264', 'Plants depend on innate immunity to prevent disease. Plant pathogenic bacteria,  like Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas campestris, use the type III secretion  system as a molecular syringe to inject type III secreted effector (T3SE)  proteins in plants. The primary function of most T3SEs is to suppress immunity;  however, the plant can evolve nucleotide-binding domain-leucine-rich repeat  domain-containing proteins to recognize specific T3SEs. The AtZAR1 NLR induces  strong defense responses against P. syringae and X. campestris The P. syringae  T3SE HopZ1a is an acetyltransferase that acetylates the pseudokinase AtZED1 and  triggers recognition by AtZAR1. However, little is known about the molecular  mechanisms that lead to AtZAR1-induced immunity in response to HopZ1a. We  established a transient expression system in Nicotiana benthamiana to study  detailed interactions among HopZ1a, AtZED1, and AtZAR1. We show that the AtZAR1  immune pathway is conserved in N. benthamiana and identify AtZAR1 domains, and  residues in AtZAR1 and AtZED1, that are important for immunity and  protein-protein interactions in planta and in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).  We show that the coiled-coil domain of AtZAR1 oligomerizes, and this domain acts  as a signal to induce immunity. This detailed analysis of the AtZAR1-AtZED1  protein complex provides a better understanding of the immune signaling hub  controlled by AtZAR1.', '2017 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.00441', 'ORCID:']
