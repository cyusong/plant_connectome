Communication of mitochondria with other cell compartments is essential for the coordination of cellular functions. Mitochondria send retrograde signals through metabolites, redox changes, direct organelle contacts and protein trafficking. Accumulating evidence indicates that, in animal systems, changes in mitochondrial function also trigger responses in other, either neighbouring or distantly located, cells. Although not clearly established, there are indications that this type of communication may also be operative in plants. Grafting experiments suggested that the translocation of entire mitochondria or submitochondrial vesicles between neighbouring cells is possible in plants, as already documented in animals. Changes in mitochondrial function also regulate cell-to-cell communication via plasmodesmata and may be transmitted over long distances through plant hormones acting as mitokines to relay mitochondrial signals to distant tissues. Long-distance movement of transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in crucial aspects of metabolism and retrograde signalling was also described. Finally, changes in mitochondrial reactive species (ROS) production may affect the 'ROS wave' that triggers systemic acquired acclimation throughout the plant. In this review, we summarise available evidence suggesting that mitochondria establish sophisticated communications not only within the cell but also with neighbouring cells and distant tissues to coordinate plant growth and stress responses in a cell nonautonomous manner.
