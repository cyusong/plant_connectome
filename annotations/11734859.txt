['11734859', 'Salicylic acid (SA) mediates plant defences against pathogens, accumulating in  both infected and distal leaves in response to pathogen attack.  Pathogenesis-related gene expression and the synthesis of defensive compounds  associated with both local and systemic acquired resistance (LAR and SAR) in  plants require SA. In Arabidopsis, exogenous application of SA suffices to  establish SAR, resulting in enhanced resistance to a variety of pathogens.  However, despite its importance in plant defence against pathogens, SA  biosynthesis is not well defined. Previous work has suggested that plants  synthesize SA from phenylalanine; however, SA could still be produced when this  pathway was inhibited, and the specific activity of radiolabelled SA in feeding  experiments was often lower than expected. Some bacteria such as Pseudomonas  aeruginosa synthesize SA using isochorismate synthase (ICS) and pyruvate lyase.  Here we show, by cloning and characterizing an Arabidopsis defence-related gene  (SID2) defined by mutation, that SA is synthesized from chorismate by means of  ICS, and that SA made by this pathway is required for LAR and SAR responses.', '2001 Nov 29', 'Nature', '10.1038/35107108', 'Ausubel']
