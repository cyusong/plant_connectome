Ramularia collo-cygni causes Ramularia leaf spot (RLS) disease of barley. The fungus develops asymptomatically within its host until late in the growing season, when necrotic lesions become visible on upper leaves. Fungal secondary metabolites (SM) have been proposed as important factors in RLS lesion formation but the biosynthetic pathways involved remain largely unknown. Mining the R. collo-cygni genome revealed the presence of 10 polyketide synthases (PKS), 10 nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and 3 hybrid PKS-NRPS (HPS) identified within clusters of genes with predicted functions associated with secondary metabolism. SM core genes along with their predicted transcriptional regulators exhibited transcriptional coexpression during infection of barley plants. Moreover, their expression peaked during early stages of host colonization and preceded or overlapped with the appearance of disease symptoms, suggesting that SM may manipulate the host to promote colonization or protect R. collo-cygni from competing organisms. Accordingly, R. collo-cygni inhibited the growth of several fungi in vitro, indicating that it synthesized and excreted antifungal agents. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the R. collo-cygni genome contains the genetic architecture to synthesize a wide range of SM and suggests that coexpression of PKS and HPS is associated with competitive colonization of the host and early symptom development.
