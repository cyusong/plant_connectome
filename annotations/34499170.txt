Trichomes are specialized glandular or non-glandular structures that provide physical or chemical protection against insect and pathogen attack. Trichomes in Arabidopsis have been extensively studied as typical non-glandular structures. By contrast, the molecular mechanism underlying glandular trichome formation and elongation remains largely unknown. We previously demonstrated that Hair is essential for the formation of type I and type VI trichomes. Here, we found that overexpression of Hair increased the density and length of tomato trichomes. Biochemical assays revealed that Hair physically interacts with its close homolog SlZFP8-like (SlZFP8L), and SlZFP8L also directly interacts with Woolly. SlZFP8L-overexpressing plants showed increased trichome density and length. We further found that the expression of SlZFP6, which encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein, is positively regulated by Hair. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, yeast one-hybrid, and dual-luciferase assays we identified that SlZFP6 is a direct target of Hair. Similar to Hair and SlZFP8L, the overexpression of SlZFP6 also increased the density and length of tomato trichomes. Taken together, our results suggest that Hair interacts with SlZFP8-like to regulate the initiation and elongation of trichomes by modulating SlZFP6 expression in tomato.
