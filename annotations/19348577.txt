Late blight, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, is one of the most devastating diseases of potato. Resistance (R) genes from the wild species Solanum demissum have been used by breeders to generate late-blight-resistant cultivars but resistance was soon overcome by the pathogen. A more recent screening of a large number of wild species has led to the identification of novel sources of resistance, many of which are currently being characterized further. Here, we report on the cloning of dominant Rpi genes from S. venturii. Rpi-vnt1.1 and Rpi-vnt1.3 were mapped to chromosome 9 using nucleotide binding site (NBS) profiling. Subsequently, a Tm-2(2)-based allele mining strategy was used to clone both genes. Rpi-vnt1.1 and Rpi-vnt1.3 belong to the coiled-coil NBS leucine-rich repeat (LRR) class of plant R genes and encode predicted peptides of 891 and 905 amino acids (aa), respectively, which share 75% amino acid identity with the Tomato mosaic virus resistance protein Tm-2(2) from tomato. Compared with Rpi-vnt1.1, Rpi-vnt1.3 harbors a 14-aa insertion in the N-terminal region of the protein and two different amino acids in the LRR domain. Despite these differences, Rpi-vnt1.1 and Rpi-vnt1.3 genes have the same resistance spectrum.
