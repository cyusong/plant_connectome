Fusarium head blight (FHB), mainly occurring upon <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> infection in a wide variety of small-grain cereals, is supposed to be controlled by a range of processes diverted by the fungal pathogen, the so-called susceptibility factors. As a mean to provide relevant information about the molecular events involved in FHB susceptibility in bread wheat, we studied an extensive proteome of more than 7,900 identified wheat proteins in three cultivars of contrasting susceptibilities during their interaction with three <i>F. graminearum</i> strains of different aggressiveness. No cultivar-specific proteins discriminated the three wheat genotypes, demonstrating the establishment of a core proteome regardless of unequivocal FHB susceptibility differences. Quantitative protein analysis revealed that most of the FHB-induced molecular adjustments were shared by wheat cultivars and occurred independently of the <i>F. graminearum</i> strain aggressiveness. Although subtle abundance changes evidenced genotype-dependent responses to FHB, cultivar distinction was found to be mainly due to basal abundance differences, especially regarding the chloroplast functions. Integrating these data with previous proteome mapping of the three <i>F. graminearum</i> strains facing the three same wheat cultivars, we demonstrated strong correlations between the wheat protein abundance changes and the adjustments of fungal proteins supposed to interfere with host molecular functions. Together, these results provide a resourceful dataset that expands our understanding of the specific molecular events taking place during the wheat-<i>F. graminearum</i> interaction.
