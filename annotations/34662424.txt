Single-cell genomics has the potential to revolutionize the study of plant development and tissue-specific responses to environmental stimuli by revealing heretofore unknown players and gene regulatory processes. Here, I focus on the current state of single-cell genomics in plants, emerging technologies and applications, in addition to outlining possible future directions for experiments. I describe approaches to enable cheaper and larger experiments and technologies to measure multiple types of molecules to better model and understand cell types and their different states and trajectories throughout development. Lastly, I discuss the inherent limitations of single-cell studies and the technological hurdles that need to be overcome to widely apply single-cell genomics in crops to generate the greatest possible knowledge gain.
