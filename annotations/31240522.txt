['31240522', 'Apical actin filaments are highly dynamic structures that are crucial for rapid  pollen tube growth, but the mechanisms regulating their dynamics and spatial  organization remain incompletely understood. We here identify that AtAIP1-1 is  important for regulating the turnover and organization of apical actin filaments  in pollen tubes. AtAIP1-1 is distributed uniformly in the pollen tube and loss of  function of AtAIP1-1 affects the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in the  pollen tube. Specifically, actin filaments became disorganized within the apical  region of aip1-1 pollen tubes. Consistent with the role of apical actin filaments  in spatially restricting vesicles in pollen tubes, the apical region occupied by  vesicles becomes enlarged in aip1-1 pollen tubes compared to WT. Using ADF1 as a  representative actin-depolymerizing factor, we demonstrate that AtAIP1-1 enhances  ADF1-mediated actin depolymerization and filament severing in vitro, although  AtAIP1-1 alone does not have an obvious effect on actin assembly and disassembly.  The dynamics of apical actin filaments are reduced in aip1-1 pollen tubes  compared to WT. Our study suggests that AtAIP1-1 works together with ADF to act  as a module in regulating the dynamics of apical actin filaments to facilitate  the construction of the unique "apical actin structure" in the pollen tube.', '2020 Feb', 'Sci China Life Sci', '10.1007/s11427-019-9532-0', 'Huang']
