Heterosis has been widely accepted as an effective strategy to increase yields in plant breeding. Notably, the chemical hybridization agent SQ-1 induces male sterility in wheat, representing a critical potential tool in hybrid seed production. However, the mechanisms underlying the male sterility induced by SQ-1 still remain poorly understood. In this study, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene, <i>TaICK1</i>, which encodes a 229 amino acid protein, was identified as a potential contributor to male sterility in common wheat. The expression of <i>TaICK1</i> was upregulated during the development of anthers in Xinong1376 wheat treated with SQ-1. Meanwhile, the seed setting rate was found to be significantly decreased in <i>TaICK1</i> transgenic rice. Furthermore, we identified two cyclin proteins, <i>TaCYCD2;1</i> and <i>TaCYCD6;1</i>, as interactors through yeast two-hybrid screening using TaICK1 as the bait, which were validated using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Subcellular localization revealed that the proteins encoded by <i>TaICK1</i>, <i>TaCYCD2;1,</i> and <i>TaCYCD6;1</i> were localized in the cell nucleus. The expression levels of <i>TaCYCD2;1</i> and <i>TaCYCD6;1</i> were lower in Xinong1376 treated with SQ-1. A further analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of <i>OsCYCD2;1</i> and <i>OsCYCD6;1</i> were lower in transgenic <i>TaICK1</i> rice lines as well. Taken together, these results suggest that the upregulation of <i>TaICK1,</i> induced by SQ-1, may subsequently suppress the expression of <i>TaCYCD2;1</i> and <i>TaCYCD6;1</i> in anthers, resulting in male sterility. This study provides new insights into the understanding of SQ-1-induced wheat male sterility, as well as the developmental mechanisms of anthers.
