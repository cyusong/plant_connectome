Iron is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and development. Under low iron conditions, Arabidopsis plants take up soil iron using the root iron transporter IRT1. In addition to iron, IRT1 also transports others divalent metals, including cadmium, which consequently accumulates into plant tissues and enters the food chain. IRT1 expression was shown to be regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels by its essential metal substrates to maximize iron uptake while limiting the accumulation of zinc, manganese, or cobalt. Here, we characterized the regulation of IRT1 by cadmium. A short-term exposure to cadmium decreased the cell surface levels of IRT1 through endocytosis and degradation, but with a lower efficiency than observed for other IRT1 metal substrates. We demonstrated that IRT1 endocytosis in response to cadmium is mediated through the direct binding of cadmium to histidine residues within the regulatory loop of IRT1. However, we revealed that the affinity of the metal sensing motif is much lower for cadmium compared to other metal substrates of IRT1. Finally, we proved that cadmium-induced IRT1 degradation takes place through ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis driven by the UBC35/36 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and the IDF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Altogether, this work sheds light on the mechanisms of cadmium-mediated downregulation of IRT1 and provides an additional molecular basis for cadmium accumulation and toxicity in plants.
