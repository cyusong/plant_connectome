The discovery and deployment of new broad-spectrum resistance (<i>R</i>) genes from cultivated rice and its wild relatives is a strategy to broaden the genetic basis of modern rice cultivars to combat rice blast disease. <i>Oryza glaberrima</i> possessing many valuable traits for tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, is an elite gene pool for improvement of Asian cultivated rice. An introgression line IL106 derived from <i>O. glaberrima</i> (Acc. IRGC100137) confers complete resistance to <i>Magnaporthe oryza</i>e in blast nursery. Genetic analysis using 2185 BC<sub>6</sub>F<sub>2</sub> progenies derived from a cross between IL106 and the recurrent parent Dianjingyou 1 showed that IL106 harbors a single dominant resistance gene against <i>M. oryzae</i> strain 09BSH-10-5A. This gene was preliminarily mapped on the long arm of chromosome 6 of rice in a region of ca. 0.9 cM delimited by two SSR markers (RM20650 and RM20701). In order to finely map this gene, 17,100 additional progenies were further analyzed. As a result, this gene was further narrowed down to a region flanked by two molecular markers STS69-15 and STS69-7, and co-segregated with 3 molecular markers, RM20676, STS69-21 and STS69-22 on the long arm of chromosome 6. Based on reference genome sequences, this <i>R</i> gene was mapped in silico in 76.1-Kb and 67.7-Kb physical intervals, and containing 4 and 3 NBS-LRR candidate genes in <i>O. sativa</i> cultivar Nipponbare and <i>O. glaberrima</i> cultivar CG14, respectively. Because no blast resistance gene was finely mapped in this physical interval before, this <i>R</i> gene was considered as not described yet and designated as <i>Pi69</i>(t), which is the first identified and finely mapped blast <i>R</i> gene from <i>O. glaberrima</i>, as far as we know. Evaluation of IL106 with 151 blast strains collected from 6 countries in Asia showed that 148 strains are avirulent on IL106, suggesting that <i>Pi69</i>(t) is a broad-spectrum blast <i>R</i> gene, and a promising resistant resource for improvement of Asian cultivated rice.
