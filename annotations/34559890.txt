Maize kernel weight is influenced by the unloading of nutrients from the maternal placenta and their passage through the transfer tissue of the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) and the basal intermediate zone (BIZ) to the upper part of the endosperm. Here, we show that Small kernel 10 (Smk10) encodes a choline transporter-like protein 1 (ZmCTLP1) that facilitates choline uptake and is located in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Its loss of function results in reduced choline content, leading to smaller kernels with a lower starch content. Mutation of ZmCTLP1 disrupts membrane lipid homeostasis and the normal development of wall in-growths. Expression levels of Mn1 and ZmSWEET4c, two kernel filling-related genes, are downregulated in the smk10, which is likely to be one of the major causes of incompletely differentiated transfer cells. Mutation of ZmCTLP1 also reduces the number of plasmodesmata (PD) in transfer cells, indicating that the smk10 mutant is impaired in PD formation. Intriguingly, we also observed premature cell death in the BETL and BIZ of the smk10 mutant. Together, our results suggest that ZmCTLP1-mediated choline transport affects kernel development, highlighting its important role in lipid homeostasis, wall in-growth formation and PD development in transfer cells.
