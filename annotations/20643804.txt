['20643804', 'Mature pollen is very sensitive to cold stress in chilling-sensitive plants.  Plant WRKY DNA-binding transcription factors are key regulators in plant  responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Previous studies have suggested that  WRKY34 (At4g26440) gene might be involved in pollen viability, although the  mechanism involved is unclear. In this study, it is shown that cold treatment  increased WRKY34 expression in the wild type, and promoter-GUS analysis revealed  that WRKY34 expression is pollen-specific. Enhanced green fluorescent  protein-tagged WRKY34 was localized in the nuclei. Pollen harbouring the wrky34  allele showed higher viability than pollen with the WRKY34 allele after cold  treatment. Further functional analysis indicated that the WRKY34 transcription  factor was involved in pollen development regulated by the pollen-specific MIKC*  class of MADS-domain transcription factors under cold stress, and  cold-insensitivity of mature wrky34 pollen might be partly attributable to the  enhanced expression of transcriptional activator CBFs in the mutants. Thus, the  WRKY34 transcription factor negatively mediated cold sensitivity of mature  Arabidopsis pollen and might be involved in the CBF signal cascade in mature  pollen.', '2010 Sep', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erq204', 'Yu']
