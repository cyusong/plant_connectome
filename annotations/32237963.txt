<i>Peronospora destructor</i> is an obligate biotrophic oomycete that causes downy mildew on onion (<i>Allium cepa</i>). Onion is an important crop worldwide, but its production is affected by this pathogen. We sequenced the genome of <i>P. destructor</i> using the PacBio sequencing platform, and de novo assembly resulted in 74 contigs with a total contig size of 29.3 Mb and 48.48% GC content. Here, we report the first high-quality genome sequence of <i>P. destructor</i> and its comparison with the genome assemblies of other oomycetes. The genome is a very useful resource to serve as a reference for analysis of <i>P. destructor</i> isolates and for comparative genomic studies of the biotrophic oomycetes.
