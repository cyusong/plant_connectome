Transcriptomic analyses identified anther-expressed genes in wheat likely to contribute to heat tolerance and hence provide useful genetic markers. The genes included those involved in hormone biosynthesis, signal transduction, the heat shock response and anther development. Pollen development is particularly sensitive to high temperature heat stress. In wheat, heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive cultivars have been identified, although the underlying genetic causes for these differences are largely unknown. The effects of heat stress on the developing anthers of two heat-tolerant and two heat-sensitive wheat cultivars were examined in this study. Heat stress (35 °C) was found to disrupt pollen development in the two heat-sensitive wheat cultivars but had no visible effect on pollen or anther development in the two heat-tolerant cultivars. The sensitive anthers exhibited a range of developmental abnormalities including an increase in unfilled and clumped pollen grains, abnormal pollen walls and a decrease in pollen viability. This subsequently led to a greater reduction in grain yield in the sensitive cultivars following heat stress. Transcriptomic analyses of heat-stressed developing wheat anthers of the four cultivars identified a number of key genes which may contribute to heat stress tolerance during pollen development. Orthologs of some of these genes in Arabidopsis and rice are involved in regulation of the heat stress response and the synthesis of auxin, ethylene and gibberellin. These genes constitute candidate molecular markers for the breeding of heat-tolerant wheat lines.
