In grasslands, the loss of structural carbon (C) from nonharvested plant parts is a primary C source for the soil. The amount of input depends not only on the size of structural C pools but also on their loss rates. In the field, we examined the effects of elevated atmospheric partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2) and nitrogen (N) supply on pool size and rates of structural C loss in stubble and roots of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) by using multiple-pulse labelling and steady-state labelling. Stubble retained structural C for roughly half the time it was retained in roots. Elevated pCO2 combined with low N supply enlarged the pools of roots and stubble. These conditions also stimulated the rate of structural C loss from stubble and, thus, the amounts available for further transformation. The potential of multiple-pulse labelling as a field technique is highlighted. The stimulation of structural C loss from stubble by elevated pCO2 at low N provides a missing link between increased C assimilation and low yield response and indicates a potentially higher input of structural C into the soil.

pCO2: !enlarges! structural C pools 
pCO2: !stimulates! structural C loss from stubble 
N supply: !affects! pool size and rates of structural C loss 
N supply: !combines with! pCO2 to enlarge pools 
stubble: !retains! structural C for half the time as roots 
roots: !retain! structural C for twice as long as stubble
