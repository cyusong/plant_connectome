Canola exhibits an extensive genetic variation for resistance to blackleg disease, caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Leptosphaeria maculans</i>. Despite the identification of several <i>Avr</i> effectors and <i>R</i> (race-specific) genes, specific interactions between <i>Avr-R</i> genes are not yet fully understood in the <i>Brassica napus-L. maculans</i> pathosystem. In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of resistance in an F<sub>2</sub> <sub>:</sub> <sub>3</sub> population derived from Australian canola varieties CB-Telfer (<i>Rlm4</i>)/ATR-Cobbler (<i>Rlm4</i>) using a single-spore isolate of <i>L. maculans</i>, PHW1223. A genetic linkage map of the CB-Telfer/ATR-Cobbler population was constructed using 7,932 genotyping-by-sequencing-based DArTseq markers and subsequently utilized for linkage and haplotype analyses. Genetic linkage between DArTseq markers and resistance to PHW1223 isolate was also validated using the <i>B. napus</i> 60K Illumina Infinium array. Our results revealed that a major locus for resistance, designated as <i>Rlm13</i>, maps on chromosome C03. To date, no <i>R</i> gene for resistance to blackleg has been reported on the C subgenome in <i>B. napus</i>. Twenty-four candidate <i>R</i> genes were predicted to reside within the quantitative trait locus (QTL) region. We further resequenced both the parental lines of the mapping population (CB-Telfer and ATR-Cobbler, > 80 × coverage) and identified several structural sequence variants in the form of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions (InDels), and presence/absence variations (PAVs) near <i>Rlm13</i>. Comparative mapping revealed that <i>Rlm13</i> is located within the homoeologous A03/C03 region in ancestral karyotype block "R" of <i>Brassicaceae</i>. Our results provide a "target" for further understanding the <i>Avr-Rlm13</i> gene interaction as well as a valuable tool for increasing resistance to blackleg in canola germplasm.
