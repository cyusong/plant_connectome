d-type cyclins (CYCDs) are a special class of cyclins and play extremely important roles in plant growth and development. In the plant kingdom, most of the existing studies on CYCDs have been done on herbaceous plants, with few on perennial woody plants. Here, we identified a <i>Populus</i>&nbsp;d-type cyclin gene, <i>PsnCYCD1;1</i>, which is mainly transcribed in leaf buds and stems. The promoter of <i>PsnCYCD1;1</i> activated <i>GUS</i> gene expression and transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines were strongly GUS stained in whole seedlings and mature anthers. Moreover, subcellular localization analysis showed the fluorescence signal of PsnCYCD1;1-GFP fusion protein is present in the nucleus. Furthermore, overexpression of the <i>PsnCYCD1;1</i> gene in <i>Arabidopsis</i> can promote cell division and lead to small cell generation and cytokinin response, resulting in curved leaves and twisted inflorescence stems. Moreover, the transcriptional levels of endogenous genes, such as <i>ASs</i>, <i>KNATs</i>, <i>EXP10</i>, and <i>PHB</i>, were upregulated by <i>PsnCYCD1;1</i>. Together, our results indicated that <i>PsnCYCD1;1</i> participates in cell division by cytokinin response, providing new information on controlling plant architecture in woody plants.
