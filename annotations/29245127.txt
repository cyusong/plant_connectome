Allantoin is a nitrogenous compound derived from purine catabolism that contributes to nitrogen recycling in plants. Accumulation of allantoin in plant tissues and a potential role in protection of plants from abiotic stress conditions has been identified. The present work shows that application of exogenous allantoin increased stress tolerance of Arabidopsis seedlings when germinated on, or subjected to the media containing NaCl. Allantoin-induced tolerance to NaCl stress was associated with decreased production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in seedlings. To understand the molecular mechanism, the effect of exogenous allantoin treatment on expression of several stress-related genes was investigated. Exogenous allantoin altered the expression of several antioxidant encoding genes and upregulated the expression of two genes involved in oxidative stress tolerance, SOS1 and RCD1, in the presence or absence of NaCl. Allantoin increased the NaCl tolerance of abscisic acid insensitive mutants, suggesting that it can function independently of abscisic acid signaling. These results provide additional evidence for the role of allantoin in enhancing plants tolerance to oxidative stress.
