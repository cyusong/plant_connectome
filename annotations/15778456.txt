Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) stem elongation is strongly reduced by a pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris) infestation. As pea aphid is a phloem feeder that does not transmit virus or toxins, assimilate withdrawal is generally considered as the main mechanism responsible for growth reduction. Using a kinematic analysis, we investigated the spatial distributions of relative elemental growth rates of control and infested alfalfa stems. The water, carbon, and nitrogen contents per unit stem length were measured along the growth zone. Deposition rates and growth-sustaining fluxes were estimated from these patterns. Severe short-term aphid infestation (200 young adults over a 24-h period) induced a strong and synchronized reduction in rates of elongation and of water and carbon deposition. Reduced nitrogen content and associated negative nitrogen deposition rates were observed in some parts of the infested stems, especially in the apex. This suggested a mobilization of nitrogen from the apical part of the growth zone, converted from a sink tissue into a source tissue by aphids. Calculation of radial growth rates suggested that aphid infestation led to a smaller reduction in radial expansion than in elongation. Together with earlier observations of long-lasting effects of a short-term infestation, this supports the hypothesis that in addition to nutrient withdrawal, a thigmomorphogenesis-like mechanism is involved in the effect of aphid infestation on stem growth.

Aphid: !induces! Reduction in stem elongation
Aphid: !mobilizes! Nitrogen from apical part of growth zone
Aphid: !converts! Sink tissue to source tissue
Aphid: !leads to! Smaller reduction in radial expansion
