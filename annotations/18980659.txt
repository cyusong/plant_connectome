The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains hundreds of genes essential for seed development. Because null mutations in these genes cause embryo lethality, their specific molecular and developmental functions are largely unknown. Here, we identify a role for EMB1611/MEE22, an essential gene in Arabidopsis, in shoot apical meristem maintenance. EMB1611 encodes a large, novel protein with N-terminal coiled-coil regions and two putative transmembrane domains. We show that the partial loss-of-function emb1611-2 mutation causes a range of pleiotropic developmental phenotypes, most dramatically a progressive loss of shoot apical meristem function that causes premature meristem termination. emb1611-2 plants display disorganization of the shoot meristem cell layers early in development, and an associated stem cell fate change to an organogenic identity. Genetic and molecular analysis indicates that EMB1611 is required for maintenance of the CLV-WUS stem cell regulatory pathway in the shoot meristem, but also has WUS-independent activity. In addition, emb1611-2 plants have reduced shoot and root growth, and their rosette leaves form trichomes with extra branches, a defect we associate with an increase in endoreduplication. Our data indicate that EMB1611 functions to maintain cells, particularly those in the shoot meristem, roots and developing rosette leaves, in a proliferative or uncommitted state.
