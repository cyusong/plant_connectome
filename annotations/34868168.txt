The rind appearance of melon is one of the most vital commercial quality traits which determines the preferences and behavior of consumers toward the consumption of melon. In this study, we constructed an F<sub>2</sub> population derived from SC (mottled rind) and MG (non-mottled rind) lines for mapping the mottled rind gene(s) in melon. Genetic analysis showed that there were two dominant genes (<i>CmMt1</i> and <i>CmMt2</i>) with evidence of epistasis controlling the mottled rind. Meanwhile, the phenotypic segregation ratio implied that the immature rind color had an epistatic effect on the mottled rind, which was regulated by <i>CmAPRR2</i>. A Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) DNA marker (<i>CmAPRR2</i> <sup><i>SNP(G/T)</i></sup> ) was developed and shown to co-segregate with rind color, confirming that <i>CmAPRR2</i> was <i>CmMt1</i>. Using bulked segregant analysis sequencing and KASP assays, <i>CmMt2</i> was fine-mapped to an interval of 40.6 kb with six predicted genes. Functional annotation, expression analysis, and sequence variation analyses confirmed that <i>AtCPSFL1</i> homolog, <i>MELO3C026282</i>, was the most likely candidate gene for <i>CmMt2</i>. Moreover, pigment content measurement and transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that <i>CmMt2</i> might participate in the development of chloroplast, which, in turn, decreases the accumulation of chlorophyll. These results provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying rind appearance and reveal valuable information for marker-assisted selection breeding in melon.
