Programmed meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), necessary for proper chromosomal segregation and viable gamete formation, are repaired by homologous recombination (HR) as crossovers (COs) or non-crossovers (NCOs). The mechanisms regulating the number and distribution of COs are still poorly understood. The regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1) DNA helicase was previously shown to enforce the number of meiotic COs in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> but its function in plants has been studied only in the vegetative phase. Here, we characterised barley <i>RTEL1</i> gene structure and expression using RNA-seq data previously obtained from vegetative and reproductive organs and tissues. Using RNAi, we downregulated <i>RTEL1</i> expression specifically in reproductive tissues and analysed its impact on recombination using a barley 50k iSelect SNP Array. Unlike in <i>C. elegans</i>, in a population segregating for <i>RTEL1</i> downregulated by RNAi, high resolution genome-wide genetic analysis revealed a significant increase of COs at distal chromosomal regions of barley without a change in their total number. Our data reveal the important role of RTEL1 helicase in plant meiosis and control of recombination.
