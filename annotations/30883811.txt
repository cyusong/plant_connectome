Recent progress in observing sun-induced Chl fluorescence (SIF) provides an unprecedented opportunity to advance photosynthesis research in natural environments. However, we still lack an analytical framework to guide SIF studies and integration with the well-developed active fluorescence approaches. Here, we derive a set of coupled fundamental equations to describe the dynamics of SIF and its relationship with C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. These equations show that, although SIF is dynamically as complex as photosynthesis, the measured SIF simplifies photosynthetic modeling from the perspective of light reactions by integrating over the dynamic complexities of photosynthesis. Specifically, the measured SIF contains direct information about the actual electron transport from photosystem II to photosystem I, giving a quantifiable link between light and dark reactions. With much-reduced requirements on inputs and parameters, the light-reactions-centric, SIF-based biophysical model complements the traditional, dark-reactions-centric biochemical model of photosynthesis. The SIF-photosynthesis relationship, however, is nonlinear. This is because photosynthesis saturates at high light whereas SIF has a stronger tendency to keep increasing, as fluorescence quantum yield has a relatively muted sensitivity to light levels. Successful applications of the SIF-based model of photosynthesis will depend on a predictive understanding of several previously underexplored physiological and biophysical processes. Advances can be facilitated by coordinated efforts in plant physiology, remote sensing, and eddy covariance flux observations.
