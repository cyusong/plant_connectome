Cytosolic glutamine synthetase 1;2 plays an important role in the primary nitrogen assimilation in roots. Based on characterization of the knockout mutant gln1;2 we have recently demonstrated that Gln1;2 is also essential for ammonium handling in shoots. Here we built reciprocally grafted plants between wild type (Wt) and gln1;2 in order to separate the root and shoot roles of Gln1;2. Significant reduction in silique number and seed yield were observed in the grafted plants 1;2<sub>shoot</sub>/Wt<sub>root</sub> relative to Wt<sub>shoot</sub>/1;2<sub>root</sub> and Wt<sub>shoot</sub>/Wt<sub>root</sub>. Shoot Gln1;2 thus played a crucial role for seed production. Tracing experiments with <sup>15</sup>N showed that the relative nitrogen remobilization from vegetative organs to seeds in gln1;2 was just as efficient as in the Wt plants. This was the case although the total quantity of nitrogen in gln1;2 was significantly lower compared to that in the Wt. We conclude that the functions of shoot Gln1;2 are primarily associated with internal N signaling for establishment of seed yield capacity rather than with nitrogen remobilization.
