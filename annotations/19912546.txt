Precise chromosome segregation is vital for polyploid speciation. Here, we highlight recent findings that revitalize the old question of the genetic control of diploid-like meiosis behaviour in polyploid species. We first review new information on the genetic control of autopolyploid and allopolyploid cytological diploidization, notably in wheat and Brassica. These major advances provide new opportunities for speculating about the adaptation of meiosis during polyploid evolution. Some of these advances are discussed, and it is suggested that research on polyploidy and on meiosis should no longer be unlinked.
