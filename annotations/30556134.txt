Development of adventitious roots (ARs) at the base of the shoot is an important adaptation of plants to waterlogging stress; however, its physiological mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the regulation of AR formation under waterlogged conditions by hormones and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Cucumis sativus L., an agriculturally and economically important crop in China. We found that ethylene, auxin, and ROS accumulated in the waterlogged cucumber plants. On the other hand, application of the ethylene receptor inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), the auxin transport inhibitor 1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), or the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) decreased the number of ARs induced by waterlogging. Auxin enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes, which led to ethylene entrapment in waterlogged plants. Both ethylene and auxin induced the generation of ROS. Auxin-induced AR formation was inhibited by 1-MCP, although ethylene-induced AR formation was not inhibited by NPA. Both ethylene- and auxin-induced AR formation were counteracted by DPI. These results indicate that auxin-induced AR formation is dependent on ethylene, whereas ethylene-induced AR formation is independent of auxin. They also show that ROS signals mediate both ethylene- and auxin-induced AR formation in cucumber plants.
