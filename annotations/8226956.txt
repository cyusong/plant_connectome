['8226956', 'Mutations at the fad7 locus of Arabidopsis thaliana (previously called fadD)  cause decreased desaturation of dienoic fatty acids in chloroplast lipids in  plants grown at elevated temperatures. This suggested that the fad7 locus encodes  a chloroplast omega-3 desaturase that catalyzes the desaturation of lipid-linked  18:2 and 16:2 fatty acids. In order to clone the fad7 gene, it was first  genetically mapped relative to the flanking restriction fragment length  polymorphism markers 4547 and 2488A on chromosome 3, and yeast artificial  chromosomes covering the locus were identified. A putative desaturase cDNA clone  that was isolated by low stringency heterologous probing with a cDNA for an  endoplasmic reticulum-localized omega-3 desaturase (fad3) hybridized to the yeast  artificial chromosomes and could not be resolved from the locus by restriction  fragment length polymorphism mapping. Expression of the cDNA in transgenic fad7  mutant plants resulted in restoration of wild type fatty acid composition and  suppression of a previously observed effect of the fad7 mutation on chloroplast  number, indicating genetic complementation. The structural gene contained seven  introns within a coding sequence of 1338 base pairs, which encodes a 446-amino  acid polypeptide of 51,172 daltons. The amino-terminal region of the fad7 gene  product contained a consensus chloroplast transit peptide. Except for the  amino-terminal domain, the deduced amino acid sequence of the fad7 gene product  had high homology to the fad3 gene product, indicating that fad7 encodes an  omega-3 desaturase and that the two genes arose from a common ancestral gene.  There was no apparent effect of growth temperature on the steady-state levels of  fad7 mRNA in wild type plants.', '1993 Nov 15', 'J Biol Chem', 'S0021-9258(20)80498-0', 'Somerville']
