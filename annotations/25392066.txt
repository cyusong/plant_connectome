['25392066', 'Arabidopsis thaliana xyloglucan has an XXXG structure, with branches of xylosyl  residues, beta-D-galacosyl-(1,2)-alpha-d-xylosyl motifs and fucosylated  beta-D-galactosyl-(1,2)-alpha-D-xylosyl motifs. Most of the enzymes involved in  xyloglucan biosynthesis in Arabidopsis have been identified, including the glucan  synthase CSLC4 (cellulose synthase-like C4), three xylosyltransferases (XXT1,  XXT2 and XXT5), two galactosyltransferases (MUR3 and XLT2) and the  fucosyltransferase FUT1. The XXTs and CSLC4 form homo- and heterocomplexes and  were proposed to co-localize in the same complex, but the organization of the  other xyloglucan-synthesizing enzymes remains unclear. Here we investigate  whether the glycosyltransferases MUR3, XLT2 and FUT1 interact with the XXT-CSLC4  complexes in the Arabidopsis Golgi. We used co-immunoprecipitation and  bimolecular fluorescence complementation, with signal quantification by flow  cytometry, to demonstrate that CSLC4 interacts with MUR3, XLT2 and FUT1. FUT1  forms homocomplexes and interacts with MUR3, XLT2, XXT2 and XXT5. XLT2 interacts  with XXT2 and XXT5, but MUR3 does not. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that  FUT1 forms a homocomplex through disulfide bonds, and formation of the  heterocomplexes does not involve covalent interactions. In vitro pull-down assays  indicated that interactions in the FUT1-MUR3 and FUT1-XXT2 complexes occur  through the protein catalytic domains. We propose that enzymes involved in  xyloglucan biosynthesis are functionally organized in multiprotein complexes  localized in the Golgi.', '2015 Feb', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcu161', 'Zabotina']
