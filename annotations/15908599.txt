['15908599', 'Plants have mechanisms for repairing and tolerating detrimental effects by  various DNA damaging agents. A tolerance pathway that has been predicted to be  present in higher plants is translesion synthesis (TLS), which is catalyzed by  polymerases. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), however, the only gene known  to be involved in TLS is the Arabidopsis homolog of REV3, AtREV3, which is a  putative catalytic subunit of Arabidopsis DNA polymerase zeta. A disrupted mutant  of AtREV3, rev3, was previously found to be highly sensitive to ultraviolet-B  (UV-B) and various DNA damaging agents. REV1 and REV7 are thought to be  components of translesion synthesis in plants. In this study, we identified the  Arabidopsis homologs of REV1 and REV7 (AtREV1 and AtREV7). Several mutants  carrying disrupted AtREV1 and AtREV7 genes were isolated from Arabidopsis  T-DNA-inserted lines. An AtREV1-disrupted mutant, rev1, was found to be  moderately sensitive to UV-B and DNA cross-linkers. A rev1rev3 double mutant,  like rev3, showed high sensitivity to UV-B, gamma-rays, and DNA cross-linkers. An  AtREV7-disrupted mutant, rev7, was possibly sensitive to  cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), a kind of DNA cross-linker, but it was not  sensitive to acute UV-B and gamma-ray irradiation. On the other hand, the aerial  growth of rev7, like the aerial growth of rev1 and rev3, was inhibited by  long-term UV-B. These results suggest that a TLS mechanism exists in a higher  plant and show that AtREV1 and AtREV7 have important roles in tolerating exposure  to DNA-damaging agents.', '2005 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.060236', 'Tanaka']
