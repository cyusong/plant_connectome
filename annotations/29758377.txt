Cold stress (CS) as one of the unfavorable abiotic tensions proceeds different aspects of plant responses. These responses are generated through CS effects on crucial processes such as photosynthesis, energy metabolism, ROS homeostasis, membrane fluidity and cell wall architecture. As a tolerance response, plants apply proteins in various strategies such as transferring the message of cold entrance named as signaling, producing defensive and protective molecules against the stress and degrading some unfavorable or unnecessary proteins to produce other required ones. A change in one part of these networks can irritate alternations in others. These strategies as acclimation mechanisms are conducted through gene expression reprogramming to provide a new adjusted metabolic homeostasis dependent on the stress severity and duration and plant species. Investigating protein alterations in metabolic pathways and their role in adjusting cellular components from upstream to downstream levels can provide a profound knowledge of plants tolerance mechanism against the damaging effects of CS. In this review, we summarized the activity of some cold-responsive proteins from the perception phase to tolerance response against CS.
