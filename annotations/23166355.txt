['23166355', 'The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) body, a large compartment specific to the  Brassicales, accumulates beta-glucosidase and possibly plays a role in the defense  against pathogens and herbivores. Although the ER body is a subdomain of the ER,  it is unclear whether any ER body-specific membrane protein exists. In this  study, we identified two integral membrane proteins of the ER body in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) and termed them MEMBRANE PROTEIN OF ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM  BODY1 (MEB1) and MEB2. In Arabidopsis, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription  factor, NAI1, and an ER body component, NAI2, regulate ER body formation. The  expression profiles of MEB1 and MEB2 are similar to those of NAI1, NAI2, and ER  body beta-glucosidase PYK10 in Arabidopsis. The expression of MEB1 and MEB2 was  reduced in the nai1 mutant, indicating that NAI1 regulates the expression of MEB1  and MEB2 genes. MEB1 and MEB2 proteins localize to the ER body membrane but not  to the ER network, suggesting that these proteins are specifically recruited to  the ER body membrane. MEB1 and MEB2 physically interacted with ER body component  NAI2, and they were diffused throughout the ER network in the nai2 mutant, which  has no ER body. Heterologous expression of MEB1 and MEB2 in yeast (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae) suppresses iron and manganese toxicity, suggesting that MEB1 and MEB2  are metal transporters. These results indicate that the membrane of ER bodies has  specific membrane proteins and suggest that the ER body is involved in defense  against metal stress as well as pathogens and herbivores.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.207654', 'Nishimura']
