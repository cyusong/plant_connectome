Wheat founder parents have been important in the development of new wheat cultivars. Understanding the effects of specific genome regions on yield-related traits in founder variety derivatives can enable more efficient use of these genetic resources through molecular breeding. In this study, the genetic regions related to field grain number per spike (GNS) from the founder parent Linfen 5064 were analyzed using a doubled haploid (DH) population developed from a cross between Linfen 5064 and Nongda 3338. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for five spike-related traits over nine experimental locations/years were identified, namely, total spikelet number per spike (TSS), base sterile spikelet number per spike (BSSS), top sterile spikelet number per spike (TSSS), fertile spikelet number per spike (FSS), and GNS. A total of 13 stable QTL explaining 3.91-19.51% of the phenotypic variation were found. The effect of six of these QTL, <i>Qtss.saw-2B.1, Qtss.saw-2B.2, Qtss.saw-3B, Qfss.saw-2B.2, Qbsss.saw-5A.1</i>, and <i>Qgns.saw-1A</i>, were verified by another DH population (Linfen 5064/Jinmai 47), which showed extreme significance (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in more than three environments. No homologs of reported grain number-related from grass species were found in the physical regions of <i>Qtss.saw-2B.1</i> and <i>Qtss.saw-3B</i>, that indicating both of them are novel QTL, or possess novel-related genes. The positive alleles of <i>Qtss.saw-2B.2</i> from Linfen 5064 have the larger effect on TSS (3.30%, 0.62) and have 66.89% in Chinese cultivars under long-term artificial selection. This study revealed three key regions for GNS in Linfen 5064 and provides insights into molecular marker-assisted breeding.
