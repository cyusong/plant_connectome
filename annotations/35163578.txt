Nitric oxide (NO) is a versatile signaling molecule with diverse roles in plant biology. The NO-mediated signaling mechanism includes post-translational modifications (PTMs) of target proteins. There exists a close link between NO-mediated PTMs and the proteasomal degradation of proteins via ubiquitylation. In some cases, ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of target proteins is followed by an NO-mediated post-translational modification on them, while in other cases NO-mediated PTMs can regulate the ubiquitylation of the components of ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal machinery for promoting their activity. Another pathway that links NO signaling with the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of proteins is the N-degron pathway. Overall, these mechanisms reflect an important mechanism of NO signal perception and transduction that reflect a close association of NO signaling with proteasomal degradation via ubiquitylation. Therefore, this review provides insight into those pathways that link NO-PTMs with ubiquitylation.
