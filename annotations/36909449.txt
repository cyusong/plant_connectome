Sucrose non-fermenting1-related protein kinase-2 (SnRK2) is a plant-specific protein kinase family and an important component of the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway. However, there is a lack of relevant studies in blueberry (<i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i>). In this study, we identified six SnRK2 family members (from <i>VcSnRK2.1</i> to <i>VcSnRK2.6</i>) in blueberries for the first time. In addition, we found that <i>VcSnRK2.3</i> expression was not only positively correlated with fruit ripening but was also induced by ABA signaling. Transient expression in blueberry fruits also proved that <i>VcSnRK2.3</i> promoted anthocyanin accumulation and the expression of anthocyanin synthesis-related genes such as <i>VcF3H</i>, <i>VcDFR</i>, <i>VcANS</i>, and <i>VcUFGT</i>. Transgenic <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> seeds and seedlings overexpressing <i>VcSnRK2.3</i> showed anthocyanin pigmentation. Yeast two-hybrid assays (Y2H) and Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays (BiFC) demonstrated that <i>VcSnRK2.3</i> could interact with the anthocyanin positive regulator <i>VcMYB1</i>. Finally, <i>VcSnRK2.3</i> was able to enhance the binding of <i>VcMYB1</i> to the <i>VcDFR</i> promoter. <i>Via</i> regulation transcription of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, <i>VcSnRK2.3</i> promoted anthocyanin accumulation in blueberry. The above results suggest that <i>VcSnRK2.3</i> plays an important role in blueberry anthocyanin synthesis, is induced by ABA, and can interact with <i>VcMYB1</i> to promote anthocyanin biosynthesis in blueberry.
