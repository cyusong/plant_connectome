['26662602', 'Under saline conditions, higher plants restrict the accumulation of chloride ions  (Cl(-)) in the shoot by regulating their transfer from the root symplast into the  xylem-associated apoplast. To identify molecular mechanisms underpinning this  phenomenon, we undertook a transcriptional screen of salt stressed Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots. Microarrays, quantitative RT-PCR, and promoter-GUS  fusions identified a candidate gene involved in Cl(-) xylem loading from the  Nitrate transporter 1/Peptide Transporter family (NPF2.4). This gene was highly  expressed in the root stele compared to the cortex, and its expression decreased  after exposure to NaCl or abscisic acid. NPF2.4 fused to fluorescent proteins,  expressed either transiently or stably, was targeted to the plasma membrane.  Electrophysiological analysis of NPF2.4 in Xenopus laevis oocytes suggested that  NPF2.4 catalyzed passive Cl(-) efflux out of cells and was much less permeable to  NO3(-). Shoot Cl(-) accumulation was decreased following NPF2.4 artificial  microRNA knockdown, whereas it was increased by overexpression of NPF2.4. Taken  together, these results suggest that NPF2.4 is involved in long-distance  transport of Cl(-) in plants, playing a role in the loading and the regulation of  Cl(-) loading into the xylem of Arabidopsis roots during salinity stress.', '2016 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.01163', 'ORCID:']
