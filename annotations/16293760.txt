['16293760', 'Nonhost resistance describes the immunity of an entire plant species against  nonadapted pathogen species. We report that Arabidopsis PEN2 restricts pathogen  entry of two ascomycete powdery mildew fungi that in nature colonize grass and  pea species. The PEN2 glycosyl hydrolase localizes to peroxisomes and acts as a  component of an inducible preinvasion resistance mechanism. Postinvasion fungal  growth is blocked by a separate resistance layer requiring the EDS1-PAD4-SAG101  signaling complex, which is known to function in basal and resistance (R)  gene-triggered immunity. Concurrent impairment of pre- and postinvasion  resistance renders Arabidopsis a host for both nonadapted fungi.', '2005 Nov 18', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1119409', 'Schulze-Lefert']
