['26100864', "Histone phosphorylation plays key roles in stress-induced transcriptional  reprogramming in metazoans but its function(s) in land plants has remained  relatively unexplored. Here we report that an Arabidopsis mutant defective in  At3g03940 and At5g18190, encoding closely related Ser/Thr protein kinases, shows  pleiotropic phenotypes including dwarfism and hypersensitivity to osmotic/salt  stress. The double mutant has reduced global levels of phosphorylated histone H3  threonine 3 (H3T3ph), which are not enhanced, unlike the response in the wild  type, by drought-like treatments. Genome-wide analyses revealed increased H3T3ph,  slight enhancement in trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), and a modest  decrease in histone H3 occupancy in pericentromeric/knob regions of wild-type  plants under osmotic stress. However, despite these changes in heterochromatin,  transposons and repeats remained transcriptionally repressed. In contrast, this  reorganization of heterochromatin was mostly absent in the double mutant, which  exhibited lower H3T3ph levels in pericentromeric regions even under normal  environmental conditions. Interestingly, within actively transcribed  protein-coding genes, H3T3ph density was minimal in 5' genic regions,  coincidental with a peak of H3K4me3 accumulation. This pattern was not affected  in the double mutant, implying the existence of additional H3T3 protein kinases  in Arabidopsis. Our results suggest that At3g03940 and At5g18190 are involved in  the phosphorylation of H3T3 in pericentromeric/knob regions and that this  repressive epigenetic mark may be important for maintaining proper  heterochromatic organization and, possibly, chromosome function(s).", '2015 Jul 7', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1423325112', 'Cerutti']
