['18784284', 'Trichome initiation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is controlled by the  TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) network that consists of R2R3- and R1-type  MYB-related transcription factors, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, and  the WD40 protein TTG1. An experimental method was designed to investigate the  molecular mechanisms by which jasmonates, cytokinins, and gibberellins modulate  Arabidopsis leaf trichome formation. All three phytohormones provoked a seemingly  common effect on cell patterning by promoting trichome initiation but caused  strikingly distinct effects on cell and trichome maturation. The phytohormonal  control was mediated by transcriptional regulation of the established TTG1  complex and depended on the R2R3-MYB factor GLABRA1. However, unsuspected degrees  of functional specialization of the bHLH factors and a resultant differential  molecular regulation of trichome initiation on leaf lamina and leaf margins were  revealed. Trichome formation on leaf lamina relied entirely on GLABRA3 and  ENHANCER OF GLABRA3. Conversely, TRANSPARENT TESTA8 (TT8) was particularly  important for marginal trichome development. This hitherto unknown role for TT8  in trichome formation further underscored the functional redundancy between the  three TTG1-dependent bHLH proteins.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.125385', 'Goossens']
