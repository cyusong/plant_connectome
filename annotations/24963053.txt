In Arabidopsis thaliana, seven cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors have been identified, designated interactors of CDKs or Kip-related proteins (KRPs). Here, the function of KRP6 was investigated during cell cycle progression in roots infected by plant-parasitic root-knot nematodes. Contrary to expectations, analysis of Meloidogyne incognita-induced galls of KRP6-overexpressing lines revealed a role for this particular KRP as an activator of the mitotic cell cycle. In accordance, KRP6-overexpressing suspension cultures displayed accelerated entry into mitosis, but delayed mitotic progression. Likewise, phenotypic analysis of cultured cells and nematode-induced giant cells revealed a failure in mitotic exit, with the appearance of multinucleated cells as a consequence. Strong KRP6 expression upon nematode infection and the phenotypic resemblance between KRP6 overexpression cell cultures and root-knot morphology point toward the involvement of KRP6 in the multinucleate and acytokinetic state of giant cells. Along these lines, the parasite might have evolved to manipulate plant KRP6 transcription to the benefit of gall establishment.
