Cellular processes rely on the intimate interplay of different molecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites. Obtaining and integrating data on their abundance and dynamics at high temporal and spatial resolution are essential for our understanding of plant growth and development. In the past decade, enzymatic proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a powerful tool to study local protein and nucleotide ensembles, discover protein-protein and protein-nucleotide interactions, and resolve questions about protein localization and membrane topology. An ever-growing number and continuous improvement of enzymes and methods keep broadening the spectrum of possible applications for PL and make it more accessible to different organisms, including plants. While initial PL experiments in plants required high expression levels and long labeling times, recently developed faster enzymes now enable PL of proteins on a cell type-specific level, even with low-abundant baits, and in different plant species. Moreover, expanding the use of PL for additional purposes, such as identification of locus-specific gene regulators or high-resolution electron microscopy may now be in reach. In this review, we give an overview of currently available PL enzymes and their applications in mammalian cell culture and plants. We discuss the challenges and limitations of PL methods and highlight open questions and possible future directions for PL in plants.
