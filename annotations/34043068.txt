This review highlights the most recent updated information available about Zn phytotoxicity at physiological, biochemical and molecular levels, uptake mechanisms as well as excess Zn homeostasis in plants. Zinc (Zn) is a natural component of soil in terrestrial environments and is a vital element for plant growth, as it performs imperative functions in numerous metabolic pathways. However, potentially noxious levels of Zn in soils can result in various alterations in plants like reduced growth, photosynthetic and respiratory rate, imbalanced mineral nutrition and enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species. Zn enters into soils through various sources, such as weathering of rocks, forest fires, volcanoes, mining and smelting activities, manure, sewage sludge and phosphatic fertilizers. The rising alarm in environmental facet, as well as, the narrow gap between Zn essentiality and toxicity in plants has drawn the attention of the scientific community to its effects on plants and crucial role in agricultural sustainability. Hence, this review focuses on the most recent updates about various physiological and biochemical functions perturbed by high levels of Zn, its mechanisms of uptake and transport as well as molecular aspects of surplus Zn homeostasis in plants. Moreover, this review attempts to understand the mechanisms of Zn toxicity in plants and to present novel perspectives intended to drive future investigations on the topic. The findings will further throw light on various mechanisms adopted by plants to cope with Zn stress which will be of great significance to breeders for enhancing tolerance to Zn contamination.
