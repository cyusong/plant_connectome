Protein post-translational modifications play critical roles in cellular processes, development and stress response. The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to proteins is one of the essential modifications in eukaryotes, but its function remains largely unknown in plant pathogenic fungi. We present a comprehensive analysis combined with proteomic, molecular and cellular approaches to explore the roles of sumoylation in the model plant fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae. We found the SUMO pathway plays key roles in colony growth, conidia formation and virulence to the host, as well as cell-cycle-related phenotypes. Sumoylation is also involved in responding to different stresses. Affinity purification identified 940 putative SUMO substrates, many of which were reported to be involved in development, stress response and infection. Interestingly, four septins were also shown to be sumoylated. Mutation of consensus sumoylation sites in each septin all resulted in reduced virulence to the host and dislocation of septins in appressoria. Moreover, sumoylation is also involved in extracellular secretion of different effector proteins. Our study on the functions of sumoylation provides novel insight into development and infection of the rice blast fungus.
