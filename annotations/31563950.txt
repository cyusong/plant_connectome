Primary physicochemical steps in microwounding of plants were investigated using electrochemical nano- and microprobes, with a focus on the role of oxygen in the wounding responses of individual plant cells. Electrochemical measurements of cell oxygen content were made with carbon-filled quartz micropipettes with platinum-coated tips (oxygen nanosensors). These novel platinum nanoelectrodes are useful for understanding cell oxygen metabolism and can be employed to study the redox biochemistry and biology of cells, tissues and organisms. We show here that microinjury of Chara corallina internodal cells with the tip of a glass micropipette is associated with a drastic decrease in oxygen concentration at the vicinity of the stimulation site. This decrease is reversible and lasts for up to 40 minutes. Membrane stretching, calcium influx, and cytoskeleton rearrangements were found to be essential for the localized oxygen depletion induced by cell wall microwounding. Inhibition of electron transport in chloroplasts or mitochondria did not affect the magnitude or timing of the observed response. In contrast, the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity caused a significant reduction in the amplitude of the decrease in oxygen concentration. We suggest that the observed creation of localized anoxic conditions in response to cell wall puncture might be mediated by NADPH oxidase.
