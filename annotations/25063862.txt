Carbon monoxide (CO), one of the haem oxygenase (HO) products, plays important roles in plant development and stress adaptation. However, the function of CO involved in wounding responses is seldom studied. A wound-inducible gene, ipomoelin (IPO), of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas cv. Tainung 57) was used as a target to study the regulation of CO in wounding responses. After wounding for 1h, the endogenous CO content and IbHO expression level were significantly reduced in leaves. IPO expression upon wounding was prohibited by the HO activator hemin, whereas the HO inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX elevated IPO expression. The IPO expression induced by wounding, H2O2, or methyl jasmonate was inhibited by CO. CO also affected the activities of ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and peroxidase, and largely decreased H2O2 content in leaves. CO inhibited the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation induced by wounding. IbMAPK, the ERK of sweet potato, was identified by immunoblotting, and the interaction with its upstream activator, IbMEK1, was further confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation. Conclusively, wounding in leaves repressed IbHO expression and CO production, induced H2O2 generation and ERK phosphorylation, and then stimulated IPO expression.
