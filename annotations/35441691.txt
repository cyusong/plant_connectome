Flower opening is important for successful pollination in many plant species, and some species repeatedly open and close their flowers. This is thought to be due to turgor pressure changes caused by water influx/efflux, which depends on osmotic oscillations in the cells. In some ornamental plants, water-transporting aquaporins, also known as plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), may play an important role in flower opening. However, the molecular mechanism(s) involved in corolla movement are largely unknown. Gentian (Gentiana spp.) flowers undergo reversible movement in response to temperature and light stimuli; using gentian as a model, we showed that the Gentiana scabra aquaporins GsPIP2;2 and GsPIP2;7 regulate repeated flower opening. In particular, phosphorylation of a C-terminal serine residue of GsPIP2;2 is important for its transport activity and relates closely to the flower re-opening rate. Furthermore, GsPIP2;2 is phosphorylated and activated by the calcium (Ca2+)-dependent protein kinase GsCPK16, which is activated by elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels in response to temperature and light stimuli. We propose that GsCPK16-dependent phosphorylation and activation of GsPIP2;2 regulate gentian flower re-opening, with stimulus-induced Ca2+ signals acting as triggers.
