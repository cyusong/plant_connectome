['15998312', 'Ferritins are multimeric iron storage proteins encoded by a four-member gene  family in Arabidopsis (AtFer1-4). To investigate whether iron sequestration in  ferritins is a part of an iron-withholding defense system induced in response to  bacterial invasion, we used Arabidopsis thaliana as a susceptible host for the  pathogenic bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi. In this study, we used a T-DNA  insertion mutant line to show that the lack of a functional AtFer1 gene resulted  in an enhanced susceptibility of Arabidopsis plants to E. chrysanthemi. We found  that the AtFer1 gene is upregulated during infection, with a biphasic  accumulation of the transcript at critical time points 0.5 and 24 h  post-infection (p.i.). The activation of AtFer1 expression observed at 24 h p.i.  was independent of the iron-dependent regulatory sequence (IDRS) known to mediate  the transcriptional response of the AtFer1 gene to iron excess and to nitric  oxide. Upregulation of AtFer1 gene expression was compromised after inoculation  with an E. chrysanthemi siderophore null mutant. Infiltration of the purified  siderophores chrysobactin and desferrioxamine strongly increased AtFer1  transcript abundance and it did not occur with the iron-loaded forms of these  siderophores. We found that neither oxidative stress nor nitric oxide was  involved in the plant response to chrysobactin. Our data show that ferritin  accumulation during infection of Arabidopsis by E. chrysanthemi is a basal  defense mechanism which is mainly activated by bacterial siderophores. The  potential role of siderophores in this process is discussed.', '2005 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02451.x', 'Expert']
