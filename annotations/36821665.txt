De Souza <i>et al.</i> (Research Articles, 19 Aug 2022, adc9831) recently claimed major soybean yield increases resulting from transformation of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism of photosynthesis. However, there is little basis for the premise that such a transformation would result in yield increase. The field experiment was flawed and does not provide evidence for increases in crop yield.

Gene: !affects! Photosynthesis
Gene: !enhances! Yield Increase
