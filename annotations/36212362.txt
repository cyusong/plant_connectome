Rhododendron × <i>pulchrum</i>, an important horticultural species, is widely distributed in Europe, Asia, and North America. To analyze the phylogenetic and organelle genome information of <i>R.</i> × <i>pulchrum</i> and its related species, the organelle genome of <i>R.</i> × <i>pulchrum</i> was sequenced and assembled. The complete mitochondrial genome showed lineage DNA molecules, which were 816,410 bp long and contained 64 genes, namely 24 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, 3 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, and 37 protein-coding genes. The chloroplast genome of <i>R.</i> × <i>pulchrum</i> was reassembled and re-annotated; the results were different from those of previous studies. There were 42 and 46 simple sequence repeats (SSR) identified from the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of <i>R.</i> × <i>pulchrum</i>, respectively. Five genes (<i>nad1</i>, <i>nad2</i>, <i>nad4</i>, <i>nad7</i>, and <i>rps3</i>) were potentially useful molecular markers. The <i>R.</i> × <i>pulchrum</i> mitochondrial genome collinear alignment among five species of the Ericaceae showed that the mitochondrial genomes of these related species have a high degree of homology with <i>R.</i> × <i>pulchrum</i> in this gene region, and the most conservative genes were <i>trnC-GCA</i>, <i>trnD-GUC</i>, <i>trnM-CAU</i>, <i>trnN-GUU</i>, <i>trnY-GUA</i>, <i>atp4</i>, <i>nad4</i>, <i>nad2</i>, <i>nad5</i>, <i>ccmC</i>, and <i>rrn26</i>. The phylogenetic trees of mitochondrial genome showed that <i>R</i>. <i>simsii</i> was a sister to <i>R.</i> × <i>pulchrum</i>. The results verified that there was gene rearrangement between <i>R.</i> × <i>pulchrum</i> and <i>R</i>. <i>simsii</i> mitochondrial genomes. The codon usage bias of 10 Ericaceae mitochondrial genes and 7 <i>Rhododendron</i> chloroplast genes were influenced by mutation, while other genes codon usages had undergone selection. The study identified 13 homologous fragments containing gene sequences between the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of <i>R.</i> × <i>pulchrum</i>. Overall, our results illustrate the organelle genome information could explain the phylogenetics of plants and could be used to develop molecular markers and genetic evolution. Our study will facilitate the study of population genetics and evolution in <i>Rhododendron</i> and other genera in Ericaceae.
