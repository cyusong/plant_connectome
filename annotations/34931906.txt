The lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of gram-negative bacteria trigger a nitrosative and oxidative burst in both animals and plants during pathogen invasion. <i>Liberibacter crescens</i> strain BT-1 is a surrogate for functional genomic studies of the uncultured pathogenic '<i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter' spp. that are associated with severe diseases such as citrus greening and potato zebra chip. Structural determination of <i>L. crescens</i> LPS revealed the presence of a very long chain fatty acid modification. <i>L. crescens</i> LPS pretreatment suppressed growth of X<i>anthomonas perforans</i> on nonhost tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) and <i>X. citri</i> subsp. <i>citri</i> on host orange (<i>Citrus sinensis</i>), confirming bioactivity of <i>L. crescens</i> LPS in activation of systemic acquired resistance (SAR). <i>L. crescens</i> LPS elicited a rapid burst of nitric oxide (NO) in suspension cultured tobacco cells. Pharmacological inhibitor assays confirmed that arginine-utilizing NO synthase (NOS) activity was the primary source of NO generation elicited by <i>L. crescens</i> LPS. LPS treatment also resulted in biological markers of NO-mediated SAR activation, including an increase in the glutathione pool, callose deposition, and activation of the salicylic acid and azelaic acid (AzA) signaling networks. Transient expression of '<i>Ca</i>. L. asiaticus' bacterioferritin comigratory protein (BCP) peroxiredoxin in tobacco compromised AzA signaling, a prerequisite for LPS-triggered SAR. Western blot analyses revealed that '<i>Ca</i>. L. asiaticus' BCP peroxiredoxin prevented peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration in tobacco. '<i>Ca</i>. L. asiaticus' BCP peroxiredoxin (i) attenuates NO-mediated SAR signaling and (ii) scavenges peroxynitrite radicals, which would facilitate repetitive cycles of '<i>Ca</i>. L. asiaticus' acquisition and transmission by fecund psyllids throughout the limited flush period in citrus.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
