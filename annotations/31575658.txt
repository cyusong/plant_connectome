['31575658', 'To modulate responses to developmental or environmental cues, plants use Gretchen  Hagen 3 (GH3) acyl acid amido synthetases to conjugate an amino acid to a plant  hormone, a reaction that regulates free hormone concentration and downstream  responses. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has 19 GH3 proteins, of which 8  have confirmed biochemical functions. One Brassicaceae-specific clade of GH3  proteins was predicted to use benzoate as a substrate and includes AtGH3.7 and  AtGH3.12/PBS3. Previously identified as a 4-hydroxybenzoic acid-glutamate  synthetase, AtGH3.12/PBS3 influences pathogen defense responses through salicylic  acid. Recent work has shown that AtGH3.12/PBS3 uses isochorismate as a substrate,  forming an isochorismate-glutamate conjugate that converts into salicylic acid.  Here, we show that AtGH3.7 and AtGH3.12/PBS3 can also conjugate chorismate to  cysteine and glutamate, which act as precursors to aromatic amino acids and  salicylic acid, respectively. The X-ray crystal structure of AtGH3.12/PBS3 in  complex with AMP and chorismate at 1.94 A resolution, along with site-directed  mutagenesis, revealed how the active site potentially accommodates this  substrate. Examination of Arabidopsis knockout lines indicated that the gh3.7  mutants do not alter growth and showed no increased susceptibility to the  pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, unlike gh3.12 mutants, which were more susceptible  than WT plants, as was the gh3.7/gh3.12 double mutant. The findings of our study  suggest that GH3 proteins can use metabolic precursors of aromatic amino acids as  substrates.', '2019 Nov 8', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.RA119.009949', 'Jez']
