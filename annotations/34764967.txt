A phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle at tyrosine 428 of CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (CERK1) plays an essential role in chitin triggered immunity in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. In this study, we used a differential peptide pull-down (PPD) assay to identify factors that could participate downstream of this cycle. We identified ZYGOTIC ARREST 1 (ZAR1) and showed that it interacts with CERK1 specifically when the tyrosine 428 (Y428) residue of CERK1 is dephosphorylated. ZAR1 was originally characterized as an integrator for calmodulin and G-protein signals to regulate zygotic division in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Our current results established that ZAR1 also negatively contributed to defense against the fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and played a redundant role with its homolog ZAR2 in this process. The <i>zar1-3 zar2-1</i> double mutant exhibited stronger resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i> compared with <i>zar1-3</i> single mutant, <i>zar2-1</i> single mutant, and wild-type plants. Moreover, the inducible expression of numerous defense response genes upon <i>B. cinerea</i> infection was increased in the <i>zar1-3zar2-1</i> double mutant, consistent with a repressive role for ZAR proteins in the defense response. Therefore, our findings provided insight into the function of ZAR1 in multiple defenses and developmental regulation pathways.
