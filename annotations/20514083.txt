['20514083', "Potassium transporters play crucial roles in K(+) uptake and translocation in  plants. However, so far little is known about the regulatory mechanism of  potassium transporters. Here, we show that a Shaker-like potassium channel AtKC1,  encoded by the AtLKT1 gene cloned from the Arabidopsis thaliana low-K(+)  (LK)-tolerant mutant Atlkt1, significantly regulates AKT1-mediated K(+) uptake  under LK conditions. Under LK conditions, the Atkc1 mutants maintained their root  growth, whereas wild-type plants stopped their root growth. Lesion of AtKC1  significantly enhanced the tolerance of the Atkc1 mutants to LK stress and  markedly increased K(+) uptake and K(+) accumulation in the Atkc1-mutant roots  under LK conditions. Electrophysiological results showed that AtKC1 inhibited the  AKT1-mediated inward K(+) currents and negatively shifted the voltage dependence  of AKT1 channels. These results demonstrate that the 'silent' K(+) channel  alpha-subunit AtKC1 negatively regulates the AKT1-mediated K(+) uptake in  Arabidopsis roots and consequently alters the ratio of root-to-shoot under LK  stress conditions.", '2010 Jul', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2010.74', 'Wu']
