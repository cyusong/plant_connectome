Plants acquire enhanced tolerance to intermittent abiotic stress by employing information obtained during prior exposure to an environmental disturbance, a process known as acclimation or defense priming. The capacity for stress memory is a critical feature in this process. The number of reports related to plant stress memory (PSM) has recently increased, but few studies have focused on the mechanisms that maintain PSM. Identifying the components involved in maintaining PSM is difficult due in part to the lack of clear criteria to recognize these components. In this review, based on what has been learned from genetic studies on heat acclimation memory, we propose criteria for identifying components of the regulatory networks that maintain PSM. We provide examples of the regulatory circuits formed by effectors and regulators of PSM. We also highlight strategies for assessing PSMs, update the progress in understanding the mechanisms of PSM maintenance, and provide perspectives for the further development of this exciting research field.
