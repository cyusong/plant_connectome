A laticifer is a cell involved in plant defense against biotic stresses such as herbivores and microorganisms; however, its gene expression is poorly understood. We compared protein accumulation and transcriptomes among laticifers of lignified and unlignified organs of mulberry (Morus alba), which has a non-articulated, branched type of laticifer. LA-a (equivalent to MLX56) and its homolog LA-b (insecticidal chitinase-like proteins containing two chitin-binding domains) were major proteins in laticifers of unlignified organs, and another protein (LA-c) was a major protein in laticifers of lignified organs. Purification, cDNA cloning, and bioassay of LA-c revealed that LA-c was an acidic class I chitinase having antifungal but not insecticidal activity. Comparative mRNA-Seq analysis using a GS-FLX revealed transcripts of other possible defense-related proteins. Jacalin-like lectin, galacturonase-inhibitor, and pathogenesis-related proteins were also abundant; however, the relative amounts differed among laticifers of lignified and unlignified organs. The results suggest a discontinuous laticifer network in planta and adaptation to different potential enemies among these organs.
