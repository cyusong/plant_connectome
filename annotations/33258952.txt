Light and high temperature promote plant cell elongation. PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4, a typical basic helix-loop-helix [bHLH] transcriptional activator) and the non-DNA binding atypical HLH inhibitors PHYTOCHROME RAPIDLY REGULATED1 (PAR1) and LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED 1 (HFR1) competitively regulate cell elongation in response to light conditions and high temperature. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully clarified. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, the bHLH transcription factor CRYPTOCHROME-INTERACTING BASIC HELIX-LOOP-HELIX 1 (CIB1) positively regulates cell elongation under the control of PIF4, PAR1, and HFR1. Furthermore, PIF4 directly regulates CIB1 expression by interacting with its promoter, and PAR1 and HFR1 interfere with PIF4 binding to the CIB1 promoter. CIB1 activates genes that function in cell elongation, and PAR1 interferes with the DNA binding activity of CIB1, thus suppressing cell elongation. Hence, two antagonistic HLH/bHLH systems, the PIF4-PAR1/HFR1 and CIB1-PAR1 systems, regulate cell elongation in response to light and high temperature. We thus demonstrate the important role of non-DNA binding small HLH proteins in the transcriptional regulation of cell elongation in plants.
