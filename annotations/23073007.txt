Recently, we have identified circadian clock genes as targets of Histone Monoubiquitination1 (HUB1) in Arabidopsis from a transcriptome comparison between the hub1-1 mutant and HUB1 overexpression lines. HUB1 affected the amplitudes of the circadian clock gene expression profiles in the hub1-1 mutant that coincided with reduced monoubiquitination of histone H2B at their coding regions. Here we showed that parameters for plant fitness are altered in HUB1 mutant and overexpression lines, suggesting that the histone H2B monoubiquitination status affects plant fitness.

HUB1: !affects! circadian clock gene expression
HUB1: !monoubiquitinates! histone H2B
circadian clock genes: !alter! plant fitness
histone H2B: !alters! plant fitness
