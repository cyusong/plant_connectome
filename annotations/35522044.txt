['35522044', 'Heterotrimeric G-proteins are signal transduction complexes that comprised three  subunits, Galpha, Gbeta, and Ggamma, and are involved in many aspects of plant life. The  noncanonical Galpha subunit EXTRA LARGE G-PROTEIN2 (XLG2) mediates  pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-induced reactive oxygen species  (ROS) generation and immunity downstream of pattern recognition receptors. A  mutant of the chitin receptor component CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE1 (CERK1),  cerk1-4, maintains normal chitin signaling capacity but shows excessive cell  death upon infection with powdery mildew fungi. We identified XLG2 mutants as  suppressors of the cerk1-4 phenotype. Mutations in XLG2 complex partners  ARABIDOPSIS Gbeta1 (AGB1) and Ggamma1 (AGG1) have a partial cerk1-4 suppressor effect.  Contrary to its role in PAMP-induced immunity, XLG2-mediated control of ROS  production by RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOGUE D (RBOHD) is not critical for  cerk1-4-associated cell death and hyperimmunity. The cerk1-4 phenotype is also  independent of the co-receptor/adapter kinases BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1  (BAK1) and SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1 1 (SOBIR1), but requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase  PLANT U-BOX 2 (PUB2). XLG2 localizes to both the cell periphery and nucleus, and  the cerk1-4 cell death phenotype is mediated by the cell periphery pool of XLG2.  Integrity of the XLG2 N-terminal domain, but not its phosphorylation, is  essential for correct XLG2 localization and formation of the cerk1-4 phenotype.  Our results support a model in which XLG2 acts downstream of an unknown cell  surface receptor that activates an NADPH oxidase-independent cell death pathway  in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).', '2022 Aug 1', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiac214', 'ORCID:']
