Saline-alkali stress is a widespread adversity that severely affects plant growth and productivity. Saline-alkaline soils are characterized by high salt content and high pH values, which simultaneously cause combined damage from osmotic stress, ionic toxicity, high pH and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> stress. In recent years, many determinants of salt tolerance have been identified and their regulatory mechanisms are fairly well understood. However, the mechanism by which plants respond to comprehensive saline-alkali stress remains largely unknown. This review summarizes recent advances in the physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms of plants tolerance to salinity or salt- alkali stress. Focused on the progress made in elucidating the regulation mechanisms adopted by plants in response to saline-alkali stress and present some new views on the understanding of plants in the face of comprehensive stress. Plants generally promote saline-alkali tolerance by maintaining pH and Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, while the plants responding to HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> stress are not exactly the same as high pH stress. We proposed that pH-tolerant or sensitive plants have evolved distinct mechanisms to adapt to saline-alkaline stress. Finally, we highlight the areas that require further research to reveal the new components of saline-alkali tolerance in plants and present the current and potential application of key determinants in breed improvement and molecular breeding.
