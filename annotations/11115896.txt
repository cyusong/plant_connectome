['11115896', 'Several lines of evidence suggest that regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels  is crucial for adaptation of plants to environmental stress. We have cloned and  characterized Arabidopsis auto-inhibited Ca(2+)-ATPase, isoform 4 (ACA4), a  calmodulin-regulated Ca(2+)-ATPase. Confocal laser scanning data of a green  fluorescent protein-tagged version of ACA4 as well as western-blot analysis of  microsomal fractions obtained from two-phase partitioning and Suc density  gradient centrifugation suggest that ACA4 is localized to small vacuoles. The N  terminus of ACA4 contains an auto-inhibitory domain with a binding site for  calmodulin as demonstrated through calmodulin-binding studies and complementation  experiments using the calcium transport yeast mutant K616. ACA4 and PMC1, the  yeast vacuolar Ca(2+)-ATPase, conferred protection against osmotic stress such as  high NaCl, KCl, and mannitol when expressed in the K616 strain. An N-terminally  modified form of ACA4 specifically conferred increased NaCl tolerance, whereas  full-length ATPase had less effect.', '2000 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.124.4.1814', 'Palmgren']
