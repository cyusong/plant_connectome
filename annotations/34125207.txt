['34125207', 'Pollen wall assembly is crucial for pollen development and plant fertility. The  durable biopolymer sporopollenin and the constituents of the tryphine coat are  delivered to developing pollen grains by the highly coordinated secretory  activity of the surrounding tapetal cells. The role of membrane trafficking in  this process, however, is largely unknown. In this study, we used Arabidopsis  thaliana to characterize the role of two late-acting endosomal sorting complex  required for transport (ESCRT) components, ISTL1 and LIP5, in tapetal function.  Plants lacking ISTL1 and LIP5 form pollen with aberrant exine patterns, leading  to partial pollen lethality. We found that ISTL1 and LIP5 are required for  exocytosis of plasma membrane and secreted proteins in the tapetal cells at the  free microspore stage, contributing to pollen wall development and tryphine  deposition. Whereas the ESCRT machinery is well known for its role in endosomal  trafficking, the function of ISTL1 and LIP5 in exocytosis is not a typical ESCRT  function. The istl1 lip5 double mutants also show reduced intralumenal vesicle  concatenation in multivesicular endosomes in both tapetal cells and developing  pollen grains as well as morphological defects in early endosomes/trans-Golgi  networks, suggesting that late ESCRT components function in the early endosomal  pathway and exocytosis.', '2021 Aug 31', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab132', 'ORCID:']
