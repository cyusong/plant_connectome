APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI) are B-class MADS-box floral homeotic genes of Arabidopsis and are involved in specifying the identity of petals and stamens. In the present work, IiAP3 and IiPI, the respective orthologous genes of AP3 and PI, were cloned from Isatis indigotica. By expressing in ap3-6 and pi-1 homozygous mutant and in wild-type Arabidopsis under the control of AP3 promoter or CaMV 35S promoter, we demonstrated that IiAP3 and IiPI were functionally equivalent to AP3 and PI of Arabidopsis. Referring to previous reports and the research results in the present work, expression patterns of AP3 and PI homologs are not the same in different angiosperms possessing diverse floral structures. It suggests that the alterations in expression may contribute to the changing morphology of flowers. To further determine the relationship between IiAP3 and IiPI, the coding sequences of the different structural regions in these two proteins were swapped with each other, and the data collected from transgenic Arabidopsis plants of the chimeric constructs suggested that MADS domain was irreplaceable for the function of IiAP3, K domain of IiAP3 was involved in specifying the identity of stamens, K domain of IiPI was mainly related to the formation of petals, and C-terminal region of IiPI was involved in characterization of stamens. In addition, a complete KC region of these two proteins was more effective in phenotypic complementation of the mutants.
