Nitrogen (N) is a vital mineral component that can restrict the growth and development of plants if supplied inappropriately. In order to benefit their growth and development, plants have complex physiological and structural responses to changes in their nitrogen supply. As higher plants have multiple organs with varying functions and nutritional requirements, they coordinate their responses at the whole-plant level based on local and long-distance signaling pathways. It has been suggested that phytohormones are signaling substances in such pathways. The nitrogen signaling pathway is closely associated with phytohormones such as auxin (AUX), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinins (CKs), ethylene (ETH), brassinosteroid (BR), strigolactones (SLs), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA). Recent research has shed light on how nitrogen and phytohormones interact to modulate physiology and morphology. This review provides a summary of the research on how phytohormone signaling affects root system architecture (RSA) in response to nitrogen availability. Overall, this review contributes to identifying recent developments in the interaction between phytohormones and N, as well as serving as a foundation for further study.
