Morphotypes of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, <i>Arum</i>, <i>Paris</i>, and Intermediate types, are mainly determined by host plant lineages. It was reported that the phytohormone gibberellin (GA) inhibits the establishment of <i>Arum</i>-type AM symbiosis in legume plants. In contrast, we previously reported that GA promotes the establishment of <i>Paris</i>-type AM symbiosis in <i>Eustoma grandiflorum</i>, while suppressing <i>Arum</i>-type AM symbiosis in a legume model plant, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>. This raises a hitherto unexplored possibility that GA-mediated transcriptional reprogramming during AM symbiosis is different among plant lineages as the AM morphotypes are distinct. Here, our comparative transcriptomics revealed that several symbiosis-related genes were commonly upregulated upon AM fungal colonization in <i>L. japonicus</i> (<i>Arum</i>-type), <i>Daucus carota</i> (Intermediate-type), and <i>E. grandiflorum</i> (<i>Paris</i>-type). Despite of the similarities, the fungal colonization levels and the expression of symbiosis-related genes were suppressed in <i>L. japonicus</i> and <i>D. carota</i> but were promoted in <i>E. grandiflorum</i> in the presence of GA. Moreover, exogenous GA inhibited the expression of genes involved in biosynthetic process of the pre-symbiotic signal component, strigolactone, which resulted in the reduction of its endogenous accumulation in <i>L. japonicus</i> and <i>E. grandiflorum</i>. Additionally, differential regulation of genes involved in sugar metabolism suggested that disaccharides metabolized in AM roots would be different between <i>L. japonicus</i> and <i>D. carota</i>/<i>E. grandiflorum</i>. Therefore, this study uncovered the conserved transcriptional responses during mycorrhization regardless of the distinct AM morphotype. Meanwhile, we also found diverse responses to GA among phylogenetically distant AM host plants.
