Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient for plant growth. Following uptake from the soil or assimilation within the plant, organic nitrogen compounds are transported between organelles, from cell to cell and over long distances in support of plant metabolism and development. These translocation processes require the function of integral membrane transporters. The review summarizes our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of organic nitrogen transport processes, with a focus on amino acid, ureide and peptide transporters.
