Leaf senescence is induced by various internal and external stimuli. Dark-induced senescence has been extensively investigated, but the detailed mechanism underlying it is not well understood. The red light/far-red light receptor phytochrome B and its downstream transcription factors, PYHTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) 4 and 5, are known to play an important role in dark-induced senescence. Furthermore, the senescence-inducing phytohormones, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) are reported to be involved in dark-induced senescence. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between ethylene, ABA and PIFs in dark-induced leaf senescence. A triple mutant of the core ABA signaling components; SNF1-related protein kinases 2D (SRK2D), SRK2E, and SRK2I, displayed an ABA insensitive phenotype in ABA-induced senescence, whilst the ethylene insensitive mutant <i>ein2</i> demonstrated low sensitivity to ABA, suggesting that ethylene signaling is involved in ABA-induced senescence. However, the <i>pif4 pif5</i> mutant did not display low sensitivity to ABA, suggesting that PIF4 and PIF5 act upstream of ABA signaling. Although PIF4 and PIF5 reportedly regulate ethylene production, the triple mutant <i>ein2 pif4 pif5</i> showed a stronger delayed senescence phenotype than <i>ein2</i> or <i>pif4 pif5</i>, suggesting that EIN2 and PIF4/PIF5 partially regulate leaf senescence independently of each other. While direct target genes for PIF4 and PIF5, such as <i>LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED1</i> (<i>HFR1</i>) and <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE 1</i> (<i>PIL1</i>), showed transient upregulation under dark conditions (as is seen in the shade avoidance response), expression of <i>STAY GREEN1</i> (<i>SGR1</i>), <i>ORESARA1</i> (<i>ORE1</i>) and other direct target genes of PIF5, continued to increase during dark incubation. It is possible that transcription factors other than PIF4 and PIF5 are involved in the upregulation of <i>SGR1</i> and <i>ORE1</i> at a later stage of dark-induced senescence. Possible candidates are senescence-induced senescence regulators (SIRs), which include the NAC transcription factors ORE1 and AtNAP. In fact, ORE1 is known to bind to the <i>SGR1</i> promoter and promotes its expression. It is therefore inferred that the phytochrome-PIF pathway regulates initial activation of senescence and subsequently, induced SIRs reinforce leaf senescence during dark-induced senescence.
