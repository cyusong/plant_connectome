Heavy metal pollution not only decreases crop yield and quality, but also affects human health via the food chain. Ubiquitination-dependent protein degradation is involved in plant growth, development, and environmental interaction, but the functions of ubiquitin-ligase (E3) genes are largely unknown in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Here, we functionally characterized a RING E3 ligase gene, SlRING1, which positively regulates cadmium (Cd) tolerance in tomato plants. An in vitro ubiquitination experiment shows that SlRING1 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The determination of the subcellular localization reveals that SlRING1 is localized at both the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Overexpression of SlRING1 in tomato increased the chlorophyll content, the net photosynthetic rate, and the maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), but reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species and relative electrolyte leakage under Cd stress. Moreover, SlRING1 overexpression increased the transcript levels of CATALASE (CAT), DEHYDROASCORBATE REDUCTASE (DHAR), MONODEHYDROASCORBATE REDUCTASE (MDHAR), GLUTATHIONE (GSH1), and PHYTOCHELATIN SYNTHASE (PCS), which contribute to the antioxidant and detoxification system. Crucially, SlRING1 overexpression also reduced the concentrations of Cd in both shoots and roots. Thus, SlRING1-overexpression-induced enhanced tolerance to Cd is ascribed to reduced Cd accumulation and alleviated oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that SlRING1 is a positive regulator of Cd tolerance, which can be a potential breeding target for improving heavy metal tolerance in horticultural crops.
