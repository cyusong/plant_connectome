Brassinosteroid (BR), a growth-promoting phytohormone, regulates many plant growth processes including cell development. However, the mechanism by which BR regulates fiber growth is poorly understood. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibers are an ideal single-cell model in which to study cell elongation due to their length. Here we report that BR controls cotton fiber elongation by modulating very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) biosynthesis. BR deficiency reduces the expression of 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthases (GhKCSs), the rate-limiting enzymes involved in VLCFA biosynthesis, leading to lower saturated VLCFAs contents in pagoda1 (pag1) mutant fibers. In vitro ovule culture experiments show that BR acts upstream of VLCFAs. Silencing of BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESOR 1.4 (GhBES1.4), encoding a master transcription factor (TF) of the BR signaling pathway, significantly reduces fiber length, whereas GhBES1.4 over-expression produces longer fibers. GhBES1.4 regulates endogenous VLCFA contents and directly binds to BR RESPONSE ELEMENTS (BRREs) in the GhKCS10_At promoter region, which in turn regulates GhKCS10_At expression to increase endogenous VLCFA contents. GhKCS10_At overexpression promotes cotton fiber elongation, whereas GhKCS10_At silencing inhibits cotton fiber growth, supporting a positive regulatory role for GhKCS10_At in fiber elongation. Overall, these results uncover a mechanism of fiber elongation through crosstalk between BR and VLCFAs at the single-cell level.
