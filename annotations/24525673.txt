['24525673', 'Processing (P)-bodies are cytoplasmic RNA protein aggregates responsible for the  storage, degradation, and quality control of translationally repressed messenger  RNAs in eukaryotic cells. In mammals, P-body-related RNA and protein exchanges  are actomyosin dependent, whereas P-body movement requires intact microtubules.  In contrast, in plants, P-body motility is actin based. In this study, we show  the direct interaction of the P-body core component DECAPPING PROTEIN1 (DCP1)  with the tails of different unconventional myosins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana). By performing coexpression studies with AtDCP1, dominant-negative  myosin fragments, as well as functional full-length myosin XI-K, the association  of P-bodies and myosins was analyzed in detail. Finally, the combination of  mutant analyses and characterization of P-body movement patterns showed that  myosin XI-K is essential for fast and directed P-body transport. Together, our  data indicate that P-body movement in plants is governed by myosin XI members  through direct binding to AtDCP1 rather than through an adapter protein, as known  for membrane-coated organelles. Interspecies and intraspecies interaction  approaches with mammalian and yeast protein homologs suggest that this mechanism  is evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes.', '2014 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.233031', 'Jakoby']
