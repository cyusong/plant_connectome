Functional diversification of transcription factors allows the precise regulation of transcriptomic changes under different environmental conditions. The NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) transcription factor comprises three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, and is broadly diversified in plant species, whereas Humans (<i>Homo sapiens</i>) have one protein for each subunit. However, there remains much to be learned about the diversified functions of each subunit in plants. Here, we found that NF-YB2 and NF-YB3, which have the greatest sequence similarity to each other among NF-YB family proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), are functionally diversified and specifically activate dehydration-inducible and heat-inducible genes, according to environmental conditions. Overexpression of <i>NF-YB2</i> and <i>NF-YB3</i> specifically enhanced drought and heat stress tolerance, respectively, and each single knockout mutant showed adverse stress-sensitive phenotypes. Transcriptomic analyses confirmed that overexpression of <i>NF-YB2</i> and <i>NF-YB3</i> largely affected the transcriptomic changes under dehydration and heat stress conditions, respectively. The DNA-binding profiles of each protein in planta also suggested that dehydration and heat stress increased the DNA-binding activity of NF-YB2 and NF-YB3 to dehydration-inducible and heat stress-inducible target genes, respectively. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis suggested that the NF-YB proteins of angiosperm plants belong to divergent NF-YB2 and NF-YB3 subgroups. These results demonstrate the functional diversification of NF-Y through evolutionary processes and how plants adapt to various abiotic stresses under fluctuating environments.
