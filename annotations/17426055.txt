['17426055', 'The ECTOPICALLY PARTING CELLS 1 (EPC1) gene encodes a putative retaining  glycosyltransferase of the GT64 family, and epc1-1 mutant plants have a severely  dwarfed phenotype. A new mutant allele of this gene, epc1-2, has been isolated.  Reduced cell adhesion that has previously been reported for the epc1-1 mutant was  not observed for either the epc1-1 or epc1-2 mutants grown in our conditions,  suggesting that EPC1 does not affect cell adhesion but is involved in some other  process affecting plant growth and development. It is shown that the epc1-2  mutant exhibits hypersensitivity to the phytohormone abscisic acid in germination  and root elongation assays, however it shows an unaltered response to  gibberellin, epi-brassinosteroid, auxin, or ethylene. An EPC1:YFP fusion protein  is localized to small motile structures within the cytosol that are similar in  size and number to the Golgi apparatus. Analysis of cell wall pectins revealed  that levels of beta-(1,4)-galactan in the epc1-2 mutant are reduced by 50%,  whilst other pectic polysaccharides (homogalacturonan, arabinan, and  rhamnogalacturonan II) are unchanged.', '2007', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erm040', 'Jackson']
