Malate impacts fruit acidity and plays a vital role in stress tolerance. Malate accumulation is induced by salinity in various plants as a metabolite in coping with this stress. However, the exact molecular mechanism responsible for salinity-induced malate accumulation remains unclear. Here, we determined that salinity treatment induces malate accumulation in pear (Pyrus spp.) fruit, calli and plantlets compared to the control. Genetic and biochemical analyses established the key roles of PpWRKY44 and ABRE-BINDING FACTOR3 (PpABF3) transcription factors in promoting malate accumulation in response to salinity. We found that PpWRKY44 is involved in salinity-induced malate accumulation by directly binding to a W-box on the promoter of malate-associated gene aluminum-activated malate transporter 9 (PpALMT9) to activate its expression. A series of in-vivo and in-vitro assays revealed that the G-box cis-element in the promoter of PpWRKY44 was targeted by PpABF3, which further enhanced salinity-induced malate accumulation. Taken together, these findings suggest that PpWRKY44 and PpABF3 play positive roles in salinity-induced malate accumulation in pears. This research provides insights into the molecular mechanism by which salinity affects malate accumulation and fruit quality.
