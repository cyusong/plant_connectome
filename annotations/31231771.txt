Sulfated peptides are plant hormones that are active at nanomolar concentrations. The sulfation at one or more tyrosine residues is catalysed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST), which is encoded by a single-copy gene. The sulfate group is provided by the co-substrate 3´-phosphoadenosine 5´-phosphosulfate (PAPS), which links synthesis of sulfated signaling peptides to sulfur metabolism. The precursor proteins share a conserved DY-motif that is implicated in specifying tyrosine sulfation. Several sulfated peptides undergo additional modification such as hydroxylation of proline and glycosylation of hydroxyproline. The modifications render the secreted signaling molecules active and stable. Several sulfated signaling peptides have been shown to be perceived by leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) but have signaling pathways that, for the most part, are yet to be elucidated. Sulfated peptide hormones regulate growth and a wide variety of developmental processes, and intricately modulate immunity to pathogens. While basic research on sulfated peptides has made steady progress, their potential in agricultural and pharmaceutical applications has yet to be explored.
