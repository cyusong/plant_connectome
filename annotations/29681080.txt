Drought is the most serious abiotic stress, and causes crop losses on a worldwide scale. The present study identified a previously unknown microRNA (designated as hvu-miRX) of 21 nucleotides (nt) in length in barley. Its precursor (designated pre-miRX) and primary transcript (designated pri-miRX) were also identified, with lengths of 73 and 559 nt, respectively. The identified upstream sequence of pri-miRX contained both the TATA box and the CAAT box, which are both required for initiation of transcription. Transient promoter activation assays showed that the core promoter region of pri-miRX ranged 500 nt from the transcription start site. In transgenic barley overexpression of the wheat DREB3 transcription factor (TaDREB3) caused hvu-miRX to be highly expressed as compared with the same miRNA in non-transgenic barley. However, the high expression was not directly associated with TaDREB3. Genomic analysis revealed that the hvu-miRX gene was a single copy located on the short arm of chromosome 2 and appeared to be only conserved in Triticeae, but not in other plant species. Notably, transgenic barley that overexpressed hvu-miRX showed drought tolerance. Degradome library analysis and other tests showed that hvu-miRX targeted various genes including transcription factors via the cleavage mode. Our data provides an excellent opportunity to develop drought stress tolerant cereals using hvu-miRX.
