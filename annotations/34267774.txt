Bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV) is a major disease in common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.). Host plant resistance is the primary disease control. We sought to identify candidate genes to better understand the host-pathogen interaction and develop tools for marker-assisted selection (MAS). A genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach using 182 lines from a race Durango Diversity Panel (DDP) challenged by BCMNV isolates NL-8 [Pathogroup (PG)-III] and NL-3 (PG-VI), and genotyped with 1.26 million <i>single-nucleotide polymorphisms</i> (SNPs), revealed significant peak regions on chromosomes Pv03 and Pv05, which correspond to <i>bc-1</i> and <i>bc-u</i> resistance gene loci, respectively. Three candidate genes were identified for NL-3 and NL-8 resistance. Side-by-side receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs), Phvul.003G038700 and Phvul.003G038800 were candidate genes for <i>bc-1</i>. These RLKs were orthologous to linked RLKs associated with virus resistance in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). A basic Leucine Zipper (bZIP) transcription factor protein is the candidate gene for <i>bc-u</i>. bZIP protein gene Phvul.005G124100 carries a unique non-synonymous mutation at codon 14 in the first exon (Pv05: 36,114,516 bases), resulting in a premature termination codon that causes a nonfunctional protein. SNP markers for <i>bc-1</i> and <i>bc-u</i> and new markers for <i>I</i> and <i>bc-3</i> genes were used to genotype the resistance genes underpinning BCMNV phenotypes in the DDP, host group (HG) differentials, and segregating F<sub>3</sub> families. Results revealed major adjustments to the current host-pathogen interaction model: (i) there is only one resistance allele <i>bc-1</i> for the <i>Bc-1</i> locus, and differential expression of the allele is based on presence vs. absence of <i>bc-u</i>; (ii) <i>bc-1</i> exhibits dominance and incomplete dominance; (iii) <i>bc-1</i> alone confers resistance to NL-8; (iv) <i>bc-u</i> was absent from HGs 2, 4, 5, and 7 necessitating a new gene symbol <i>bc-u</i> <sup>d</sup> to reflect this change; (v) <i>bc-u</i> <sup>d</sup> alone delays susceptible symptoms, and when combined with <i>bc-1</i> enhanced resistance to NL-3; and (vi) <i>bc-u</i> <sup>d</sup> is on Pv05, not Pv03 as previously thought. These candidate genes, markers, and adjustments to the host-pathogen interaction will facilitate breeding for resistance to BCMNV and related Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) in common bean.
