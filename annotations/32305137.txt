['32305137', 'Pollen wall characteristics are dramatically changed during pollen maturation.  Many genes have been identified as regulators of such changes in pollen wall  characteristics, but mechanisms of such changes have not been completely  understood. Here, a GDSL-type esterase/lipase gene, GELP77, is shown to regulate  such changes in Arabidopsis thaliana. GELP77-deficient (gelp77) plants exhibited  male sterility, and this phenotype was suppressed by introduction of a GELP77  genomic fragment. Mature pollen grains of wild-type Arabidopsis plants have an  organized reticulate surface structure and are dissociated from each other. In  contrast, pollen grains of gelp77 lacked such a structure and were shrunken and  stuck to each other. Nuclei were not detectable in gelp77 microspores at a  putative uninucleate stage, suggesting that GELP77 is required as early as this  stage. In plants that have the GELP77 promoter-GELP77-GFP transgene, the  GELP77-GFP fusion protein was detected in microspores, tapetal cells and middle  layer cells in anthers at post-meiotic stages, whereas not anthers at pre-meiotic  stages. Analysis of amino acid sequences suggests that GELP77 is phylogenetically  distant from the other 104 GDSL-type esterase/lipase genes in Arabidopsis and  that GELP77 orthologs are present in various plant species. Together, these  results indicate that GELP77 regulates pollen wall characteristics in  Arabidopsis.', '2020 Jun 11', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.179', 'Takano']
