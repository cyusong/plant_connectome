Plant defense responses include the extracellular release of defense-related molecules, such as pathogenesis-related proteins and secondary metabolites, as well as cell wall materials. This primarily depends on the trafficking of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, where they discharge their contents into the apoplastic space via soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor-assisted exocytosis. However, some pathogenic and symbiotic microbes have developed strategies to manipulate host plant exocytic pathways. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which plant exocytic pathways function in immunity and how microbes have evolved to manipulate those pathways.
