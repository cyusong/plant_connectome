['9177318', 'An Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding a new RNA-binding protein (RBP37) was  cloned from a silique cDNA library. The predicted amino acid sequence corresponds  to a RBP containing two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and a basic domain. An  affinity for nucleic acids was confirmed in binding assays using in vitro  synthesised AtRBP37 protein. In situ hybridisation experiments on sections of  flowers and siliques showed expression only in growing organs: gynoecium, petals,  filaments and during early-embryogenesis expression is located in the embryo  proper and the suspensor up to late heart stage. Expression is not detected in  the embryo during maturation. This results suggests an expression pattern  correlated with dividing cells.', '1997 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1005834402536', 'Gallois']
