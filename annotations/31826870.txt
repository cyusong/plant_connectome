['31826870', 'Methylation of lysine 4 in histone 3 (H3K4) is a post-translational modification  that promotes gene expression. H3K4 methylation can be reversed by specific  demethylases with an enzymatic Jumonji C domain. In Arabidopsis thaliana,  H3K4-specific JUMONJI (JMJ) proteins distinguish themselves by the association  with an F/Y-rich (FYR) domain. Here, we report that jmj14 mutations partially  suppress reduced root meristem size and growth vigor of brevis radix (brx)  mutants. Similar to its close homologs, JMJ15, JMJ16 and JMJ18, the JMJ14  promoter confers expression in mature root vasculature. Yet, unlike jmj14,  neither jmj16 nor jmj18 mutation markedly suppresses brx phenotypes.  Domain-swapping experiments suggest that the specificity of JMJ14 function  resides in the FYR domain. Despite JMJ14 promoter activity in the mature  vasculature, jmj14 mutation affects root meristem size. However, JMJ14 protein is  observed throughout the meristem, suggesting that the JMJ14 transcript region  contributes substantially to the spatial aspect of JMJ14 expression. In summary,  our data reveal a role for JMJ14 in root growth in sensitized genetic backgrounds  that depends on its FYR domain and regulatory input from the JMJ14 cistron.', '2019 Dec 11', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.183905', 'ORCID:']
