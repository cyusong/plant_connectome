To understand the color formation mechanism in eggplant (<i>Solanum melongena</i> L.) peel, a metabolomic analysis was performed in six cultivars with different peel colors. A total of 167 flavonoids, including 16 anthocyanins, were identified based on a UPLC-MS/MS approach. Further analysis revealed that the delphinidins/flavonoids ratio was consistent with the purple coloration of eggplant peels, and <i>SmF3'5'H</i> expression level was consistent with the delphinidin 3-O-glucoside and delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside contents, the main anthocyanins in the purple-peels eggplant cultivars identified in this study. <i>SmMYB113</i> overexpression promoted anthocyanins accumulation in eggplant peels and pulps. Metabolomic analysis revealed that delphinidins were still the main anthocyanins class in the peels and pulps of <i>SmMYB113</i>-OE4, but most anthocyanins were glycosylated at the 5-position of the B-ring. Our results provide new insights into the anthocyanin composition of eggplant peels and demonstrate the importance of <i>SmMYB113</i> in stimulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in eggplant fruits.
