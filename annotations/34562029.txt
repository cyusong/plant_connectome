Environmental heterogeneity is a major driver of plant-microbiome assembly, but the specific climate and soil conditions that are involved remain poorly understood. To better understand plant microbiome formation, we examined the bacteria and fungi that colonize wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca) plants in North American and European populations. Using transects as replicates, we found strong overlap among the environmental conditions that best predict the overall similarity and richness of the plant microbiome, including soil nutrients that replicate across continents. Temperature is also among the main predictors of diversity for both bacteria and fungi in both the leaf and, unexpectedly, the root microbiome. Our results indicate that a small number of environmental factors, and their interactions, consistently contribute to plant microbiome formation, which has implications for predicting the contributions of microbes to plant productivity in ever-changing environments.
