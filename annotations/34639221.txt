<i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation is one of the most commonly used genetic transformation method that involves transfer of foreign genes into target plants. Agroinfiltration, an <i>Agrobacterium</i>-based transient approach and the breakthrough discovery of CRISPR/Cas9 holds trending stature to perform targeted and efficient genome editing (GE). The predominant feature of agroinfiltration is the abolishment of Transfer-DNA (T-DNA) integration event to ensure fewer biosafety and regulatory issues besides showcasing the capability to perform transcription and translation efficiently, hence providing a large picture through pilot-scale experiment via transient approach. The direct delivery of recombinant agrobacteria through this approach carrying CRISPR/Cas cassette to knockout the expression of the target gene in the intercellular tissue spaces by physical or vacuum infiltration can simplify the targeted site modification. This review aims to provide information on <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation and implementation of agroinfiltration with GE to widen the horizon of targeted genome editing before a stable genome editing approach. This will ease the screening of numerous functions of genes in different plant species with wider applicability in future.
