Here, we present the first complete chromosome-level genome assembly of the smut fungus strain <i>Sporisorium panici-leucophaei</i> SPL10A, the causal agent of the sourgrass (<i>Digitaria insularis</i>) smut disease. Combining Illumina paired-end and Nanopore long reads, we generated a final assembly composed of 23 chromosomes (22 nuclear and one mitochondrial) with 18,915,934 bp. Gene prediction accomplished using extrinsic evidence from the sugarcane smut fungus <i>Sporisorium scitamineum</i> originated a total of 6,402 protein-encoding genes. The secretome (388 proteins) and the effectorome repertoires (68 candidates) were also predicted, given their crucial roles in plant-pathogen interactions. The complete telomere-to-telomere chromosome sequences of this poorly studied fungus will provide a valuable resource for future comparative genomic studies among smuts to unravel their underlying pathogenicity mechanisms.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
