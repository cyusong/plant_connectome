['16538523', 'Glutathione S-transferases (GST) are multifunctional proteins encoded by a large  gene family, divided on the basis of sequence identity into phi, tau, theta, zeta  and lambda classes. The phi and tau classes are present only in plants. GSTs  appear to be ubiquitous in plants and are involved in herbicide detoxification  and stress response, but little is known about the precise role of GSTs in normal  plant physiology and during biotic and abiotic stress response. Two cDNAs  representing the two plant classes tau and phi, AtGSTF9 and AtGSTU26, were  expressed in vitro and the corresponding proteins were analysed. Both GSTs were  able to catalyse a glutathione conjugation to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB),  but they were inactive as transferases towards p-nitrobenzylchloride (pNBC).  AtGSTF9 showed activity towards benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) and an activity as  glutathione peroxidase with cumene hydroperoxide (CumHPO). AtGSTU26 was not  active as glutathione peroxidase and towards BITC. RT-PCR analysis was used to  evaluate the expression of the two genes in response to treatment with herbicides  and safeners, chemicals, low and high temperature. Our results reveal that  AtGSTU26 is induced by the chloroacetanilide herbicides alachlor and metolachlor  and the safener benoxacor, and after exposure to low temperatures. In contrast,  AtGSTF9 seems not to be influenced by the treatments employed.', '2006 Sep', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-006-0146-1', 'De']
