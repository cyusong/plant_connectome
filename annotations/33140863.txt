Esca is a complex grapevine trunk disease caused by wood-rotting ascomycetes and basidiomycetes and leading to several foliar and wood symptoms. Given that the esca expression can be influenced by several environmental, physiological, and genetic factors, foliar symptoms are inconsistent in incidence and prevalence and may appear 1 year but not the following. We have previously reported a clone-dependent expression of the disease in cv Chardonnay. Owing to metabolome analysis, we could discriminate the metabolite fingerprint of green leaves collected on diseased vines of clones 76 and 95. These clone-dependent fingerprints were year-dependent in intensity and nature. The present work was conducted to determine if the clone-dependent disease expression observed is specific to Chardonnay or if it also occurs in another cultivar. A plot located in the Jura vineyard (France) and planted with both 1004 and 1026 clones of Trousseau, a cultivar highly susceptible to esca, was thus selected and studied during 2017 and 2018. A year-dependent variation of the symptoms expression was first observed and a possible relationship with rainfall is hypothesized and discussed. Moreover, a higher percentage of the clone 1026 vines expressed disease, compared to the 1004 ones, suggesting the higher susceptibility of this clone. Finally, metabolomic analyses of the remaining green leaves (i.e, without symptom expression) of partial esca-apoplectic vines allowed us to confirm a clone-dependent metabolic response to the disease. The metabolite fingerprints obtained differed in nature and intensity to those previously reported for Chardonnay and also between years.
