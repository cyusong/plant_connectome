Nitrogen fixation is crucial for plants as it is utilized for the biosynthesis of almost all biomolecules. Most of our atmosphere consists of nitrogen, but plants cannot straightforwardly assimilate this from the air, and natural nitrogen fixation is inadequate to meet the extreme necessities of global nutrition. In this study, nitrogen fixation in water was achieved by an AC-driven non-thermal atmospheric pressure nitrogen plasma jet. In addition, Mg, Al, or Zn was immersed in the water, which neutralized the plasma-treated water and increased the rate of nitrogen reduction to ammonia due to the additional hydrogen generated by the reaction between the plasma-generated acid and metal. The effect of the plasma-activated water, with and without metal ions, on germination and growth in corn plants (<i>Zea Mays</i>) was investigated. The germination rate was found to be higher with plasma-treated water and more efficient in the presence of metal ions. Stem lengths and germination rates were significantly increased with respect to those produced by DI water irrigation. The plants responded to the abundance of nitrogen by producing intensely green leaves because of their increased chlorophyll and protein contents. Based on this report, non-thermal plasma reactors could be used to substantially enhance seed germination and seedling growth.
