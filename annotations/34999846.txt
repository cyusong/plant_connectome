Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are vital for plant immunity and regulation of their production is crucial for plant health. While the mechanisms that elicit ROS production have been relatively well studied, those that repress ROS generation are less well understood. Here, via screening Brachypodium distachyon RNA interference mutants, we identified BdWRKY19 as a negative regulator of ROS generation whose knockdown confers elevated resistance to the rust fungus Puccinia brachypodii. The three wheat paralogous genes TaWRKY19 are induced during infection by virulent P. striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) and have partially redundant roles in resistance. The stable overexpression of TaWRKY19 in wheat increased susceptibility to an avirulent Pst race, while mutations in all three TaWRKY19 copies conferred strong resistance to Pst by enhancing host plant ROS accumulation. We show that TaWRKY19 is a transcriptional repressor that binds to a W-box element in the promoter of TaNOX10, which encodes an NADPH oxidase and is required for ROS generation and host resistance to Pst. Collectively, our findings reveal that TaWRKY19 compromises wheat resistance to the fungal pathogen and suggest TaWRKY19 as a potential target to improve wheat resistance to the commercially important wheat stripe rust fungus.
