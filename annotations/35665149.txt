P<sub>2</sub>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases are responsible for cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport, which plays an important role in plant development and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the role of P<sub>2</sub>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases in stress response and stomatal regulation is still elusive in soybean. In this study, a total of 12 P<sub>2</sub>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases genes (<i>GmACAs</i> and <i>GmECAs</i>) were identified from the genome of <i>Glycine max</i>. We analyzed the evolutionary relationship, conserved motif, functional domain, gene structure and location, and promoter elements of the family. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging analysis showed that vegetable soybean leaves are damaged to different extents under salt, drought, cold, and shade stresses. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis demonstrated that most of the <i>GmACAs</i> and <i>GmECAs</i> are up-regulated after drought, cold, and NaCl treatment, but are down-regulated after shading stress. Microscopic observation showed that different stresses caused significant stomatal closure. Spatial location and temporal expression analysis suggested that <i>GmACA8, GmACA9, GmACA10, GmACA12, GmACA13</i>, and <i>GmACA11</i> might promote stomatal closure under drought, cold, and salt stress. <i>GmECA1</i> might regulate stomatal closure in shading stress. <i>GmACA1</i> and <i>GmECA3</i> might have a negative function on cold stress. The results laid an important foundation for further study on the function of P<sub>2</sub>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase genes <i>GmACAs</i> and <i>GmECAs</i> for breeding abiotic stress-tolerant vegetable soybean.
