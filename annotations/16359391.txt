In Impatiens balsamina a lack of commitment of the meristem during floral development leads to the continuous requirement for a leaf-derived floral signal. In the absence of this signal the meristem reverts to leaf production. Current models for Arabidopsis state that LEAFY (LFY) is central to the integration of floral signals and regulates flowering partly via interactions with TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) and AGAMOUS (AG). Here we describe Impatiens homologues of LFY, TFL1 and AG (IbLFY, IbTFL1 and IbAG) that are highly conserved at a sequence level and demonstrate homologous functions when expressed ectopically in transgenic Arabidopsis. We relate the expression patterns of IbTFL1 and IbAG to the control of terminal flowering and floral determinacy in Impatiens. IbTFL1 is involved in controlling the phase of the axillary meristems and is expressed in axillary shoots and axillary meristems which produce inflorescences, but not in axillary flowers. It is not involved in maintaining the terminal meristem in either an inflorescence or indeterminate state. Terminal flowering in Impatiens appears therefore to be controlled by a pathway that uses a different integration system than that regulating the development of axillary flowers and branches. The pattern of ovule production in Impatiens requires the meristem to be maintained after the production of carpels. Consistent with this morphological feature IbAG appears to specify stamen and carpel identity, but is not sufficient to specify meristem determinacy in Impatiens.
