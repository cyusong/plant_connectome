The RAB GTPase is an evolutionarily conserved machinery component of membrane trafficking, which is the fundamental system for cell viability and higher order biological functions. The composition of RAB GTPases in each organism is closely related to the complexity and organization of the membrane trafficking pathway, which has been developed uniquely to realize the organism-specific membrane trafficking system. Comparative genomics has suggested that terrestrialization and/or multicellularization were associated with the expansion of membrane trafficking pathways in green plants, which has yet to be validated in basal land plant lineages. To obtain insight into the diversification of membrane trafficking systems in green plants, we analyzed RAB GTPases encoded in the genome of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha in a comprehensive manner. We isolated all genes for RAB GTPases in Marchantia and analyzed their expression patterns and subcellular localizations in thallus cells. While a majority of MpRAB GTPases exhibited a ubiquitous expression pattern, specific exceptions were also observed; MpRAB2b, which contains a sequence similar to an intraflagellar transport protein at the C-terminal region; and MpRAB23, which has been secondarily lost in angiosperms, were specifically expressed in the male reproductive organ. MpRAB21, which is another RAB GTPase whose homolog is absent in Arabidopsis, exhibited endosomal localization with RAB5 members in Marchantia. These results suggest that Marchantia possesses unique membrane trafficking pathways involving a unique repertoire of RAB GTPases.
