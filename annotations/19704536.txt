Plasmodesmata (Pd) are symplastic channels between neighboring plant cells and are key in plant cell-cell signaling. Viruses of proteins, nucleic acids, and a wide range of signaling macromolecules move across Pd. Protein transport Pd is regulated by development and biotic signals. Recent investigations utilizing the Arrhenius equation or Coefficient of conductivity showed that fundamental energetic measurements used to describe transport of proteins across membrane pores or the nuclear pore can also apply to protein movement across Pd. As leaves continue to expand, Pd transport of proteins declines which may result from changes in cell volume, Pd density or Pd structure.
