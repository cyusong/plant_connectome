Grape ripe rot is an important disease that has seriously damaged the yield and quality of grape worldwide. The disease is caused by <i>Colletotrichum viniferum</i>, a hemibiotrophic fungus that belongs to the Glomerellaceae family of Sordariomycetes class. Here, we present the genome of <i>C. viniferum</i> CvYL2a from grape, based on Illumina HiSeq 2500 and PacBio RS II. The high-quality genome consists of 70 contigs with a 73.41 Mb genome size and encodes 14,668 protein-coding genes. These genes were annotated using Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups, Nonredundant Protein, and Swiss-Prot databases. In addition, we identified a series of genes involved in pathogenicity, including 909 carbohydrate-active enzymes, 67 secondary metabolite gene clusters, and 307 cytochrome P450 enzymes. This genome sequence provides a valuable reference for research on grape-<i>C. viniferum</i> interactions, the pathogenesis of <i>C. viniferum</i>, and comparative genome analyses.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
