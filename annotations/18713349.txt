For elucidating the regulatory mechanism of ethylene on carotenoid-related volatiles (open chain) compounds and the relationship between lycopene and carotenoid-related volatiles, transgenic tomato fruits in which ACC synthase was suppressed were used. The transgenic tomato fruit showed a significant reduction of lycopene and aroma volatiles with low ethylene production. 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol and geranylacetone, which were suspected to be lycopene degradation products, were lower than those in wild type tomato fruits. In order to identify whether lycopene accumulation effects the biosynthesis of some carotenoid-related volatiles independent of ethylene in tomato or not, the capability of both wild type and transgenic tomato fruits discs to convert lycopene into carotenoid-related volatiles was evaluated. The data showed that external lycopene could convert into 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol in vivo, indicating that the strong inhibition of ethylene production had no effect on enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway of some carotenoid-related volatiles. Therefore, in ACS-suppression transgenic tomato fruits, the low levels of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol was due to decreased lycopene accumulation, not ethylene production. Ethylene only affected the accumulation of lycopene, and then indirectly influenced the level of lycopene-related volatiles.
