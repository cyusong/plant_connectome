['34403491', 'Necrosis- and ethylene-inducing peptide 1 (Nep1)-like proteins (NLPs) constitute  a superfamily of proteins toxic to dicot plants, but the molecular basis of this  toxicity remains obscure. Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis we  investigated the genetic variation underlying ion leakage in Arabidopsis plants  elicited with MoNLP1 derived from Magnaporthe oryzae. The QTL conditioning MoNLP1  toxicity was positionally cloned and further characterized to elucidate its mode  of action. MoNLP1-triggered cell death varied significantly across > 250  Arabidopsis accessions and three QTLs were identified conferring the observed  variation. The QTL on chromosome 4 was uncovered to encode a leucine-rich repeat  (LRR)-only protein designated as NTCD4, which shares high sequence identity with  a set of nucleotide-binding LRR proteins. NTCD4 was secreted into the apoplast  and physically interacted with multiple NLPs. Apoplastic NTCD4 facilitated the  oligomerization of NLP, which was closely associated with toxicity in planta. The  natural genetic variation causing D3N change in NTCD4 reduced the secretion  efficiency of NTCD4 and the infection of Botrytis cinerea on Arabidopsis plants.  These observations demonstrate that the plant-derived NTCD4 is recruited by NLPs  to promote toxicity via facilitating their oligomerization, which extends our  understanding of a key step in the toxic mode of action of NLPs.', '2021 Nov', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.17680', 'ORCID:']
