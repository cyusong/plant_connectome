JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) transcriptional repressors are key regulators of jasmonate (JA) signaling in plants. At the resting stage, the C-terminal Jas motifs of JAZ proteins bind the transcription factor MYC2 to repress JA signaling. Upon hormone elicitation, the Jas motif binds the hormone receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1, which mediates proteasomal degradation of JAZs and thereby allowing the Mediator subunit MED25 to activate MYC2. Subsequently, plants desensitize JA signaling by feedback generation of dominant JAZ splice variants that repress MYC2. Here we report the mechanistic function of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MED25 in regulating the alternative splicing of <i>JAZ</i> genes through recruiting the splicing factors PRE-mRNA-PROCESSING PROTEIN 39a (PRP39a) and PRP40a. We demonstrate that JA-induced generation of JAZ splice variants depends on MED25 and that MED25 recruits PRP39a and PRP40a to promote the full splicing of <i>JAZ</i> genes. Therefore, MED25 forms a module with PRP39a and PRP40a to prevent excessive desensitization of JA signaling mediated by JAZ splice variants.
