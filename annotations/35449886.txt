<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> causes rice blast disease and is responsible for major losses in rice production worldwide. Although numerous studies have focused on the interactions between <i>Oryza sativa</i> and <i>M. oryzae</i>, to date, the conserved mechanisms remain in part unclear. In this study, a comparative analysis of transcriptomes of <i>O. sativa</i> L. ssp. <i>japonica</i> cv. 'Nipponbare' interacting with three <i>M. oryzae</i> strains (248, 235, and 163) were performed to explore the conserved molecular mechanisms. Differentially expressed genes with similar expression patterns in the interactions between cultivar 'Nipponbare' and three <i>M. oryzae</i> strains were defined as Conserved Differentially Expressed Genes (CDEGs). These included 3,647 <i>O. sativa</i> CDEGs and 3,655 <i>M. oryzae</i> CDEGs. Four rice CDEGs (<i>LOC_Os03g19270</i>, <i>LOC_Os07g36600</i>, <i>LOC_Os05g28740</i>, and <i>LOC_Os01g32780</i>) encoding universal stress protein (USP) were induced within 24 h post-inoculation (hpi) by three <i>M. oryzae</i> strains. Meanwhile, overexpression of <i>LOC_Os07g36600</i> resulted in enhanced rice resistance against <i>M. oryzae</i>. Furthermore, four rice genes coding light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding (LHC) protein (<i>LOC_Os02g52650</i>, <i>LOC_Os09g12540</i>, <i>LOC_Os11g13850</i>, <i>LOC_Os05g22730</i>) were also identified as CDEGs and were induced at 48 hpi, which might contribute to blast resistance through reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. <i>MoCDIP4</i> is <i>M. oryzae</i> effector inducing rice cell death and were verified that include AA9 CAZy domain (namely GH61 domain). In this study, we found seven <i>MoCDIP4-</i>homologous genes coding proteins with signal peptides and AA9 CAZy domains, which were continuously up-regulated across all infection stages relative to uninoculated control. This study uncovered that genes are required for conserved mechanisms of rice-<i>M. oryzae</i> interaction, which includes rice genes encoding USP proteins and LHC proteins, as well as <i>M. oryzae</i> genes encoding AA9 proteins. This study will help us to understand how <i>O. sativa</i> responds to <i>M. oryzae</i> infections and the molecular mechanisms of <i>M. oryzae</i> pathogenicity.
