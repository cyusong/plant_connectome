['8618839', 'In most plants amino acids represent the major transport form for organic  nitrogen. A sensitive selection system in yeast mutants has allowed  identification of a previously unidentified amino acid transporter in  Arabidopsis. AAT1 encodes a hydrophobic membrane protein with 14  membrane-spanning regions and shares homologies with the ecotropic murine  leukemia virus receptor, a bifunctional protein serving also as a cationic amino  acid transporter in mammals. When expressed in yeast, AAT1 mediates high-affinity  transport of basic amino acids, but to a lower extent also recognizes acidic and  neutral amino acids. AAT1-mediated histidine transport is sensitive to  protonophores and occurs against a concentration gradient, indicating that AAT1  may function as a proton symporter. AAT1 is specifically expressed in major veins  of leaves and roots and in various floral tissues--i.e., and developing seeds.', '1995 Dec 19', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.92.26.12036', 'Ninnemann']
