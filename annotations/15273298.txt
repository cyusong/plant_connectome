['15273298', 'The 65-kD microtubule-associated protein (MAP65) family is a family of plant  microtubule-bundling proteins. Functional analysis is complicated by the  heterogeneity within this family: there are nine MAP65 genes in Arabidopsis  thaliana, AtMAP65-1 to AtMAP65-9. To begin the functional dissection of the  Arabidopsis MAP65 proteins, we have concentrated on a single isoform, AtMAP65-1,  and examined its effect on the dynamics of mammalian microtubules. We show that  recombinant AtMAP65-1 does not promote polymerization and does not stabilize  microtubules against cold-induced microtubule depolymerization. However, we show  that it does induce microtubule bundling in vitro and that this protein forms  25-nm cross-bridges between microtubules. We further demonstrate that the  microtubule binding region resides in the C-terminal half of the protein and that  Ala409 and Ala420 are essential for the interaction with microtubules. Ala420 is  a conserved amino acid in the AtMAP65 family and is mutated to Val in the  cytokinesis-defective mutant pleiade-4 of the AtMAP65-3/PLEIADE gene. We show  that AtMAP65-1 can form dimers and that a region in the N terminus is responsible  for this activity. Neither the microtubule binding region nor the dimerization  region alone could induce microtubule bundling, strongly suggesting that  dimerization is necessary to produce the microtubule cross-bridges. In vivo,  AtMAP65-1 is ubiquitously expressed both during the cell cycle and in all plant  organs and tissues with the exception of anthers and petals. Moreover, using an  antiserum raised to AtMAP65-1, we show that AtMAP65-1 binds microtubules at  specific stages of the cell cycle.', '2004 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.023937', 'Hussey']
