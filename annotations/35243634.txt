Connected ramets of colonal plants often suffer from different environmental conditions such as light, nutrient, and stress. Colonal Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon [L.] Pers.) can form interconnected ramets and this connection facilitates the tolerance to abiotic stress, which is a kind of physiological integration. However, how bermudagrass responds to heterogeneously distributed salt stress needs to be further elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that severance of stolons aggravated the damage of salt-stressed ramets, displaying higher relative electrolytic leakage (EL), lower content of chlorophyll, higher accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> , and serious oxidative damages. This finding implied the positive effects of the physiological integration of bermudagrass on salt tolerance. The unstressed ramets connected with the stressed one were mildly injured, implying the supporting and sacrifice function of the unstressed ramets. Physiological integration did not mediate the translocation of Na<sup>+</sup> among ramets, but induced a higher expression of salt overly sensitive (SOS) genes in the stressed ramets, consequently reducing the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in leaves and roots. In addition, physiological integration upregulated the genes expression and enzymes activity of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) in both stressed and unstressed ramets. This granted a stronger antioxidant ability of the whole clonal plants under salt stress. Enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> transfer and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging are mechanisms that likely contribute to the physiological integration leading to the salt tolerance of bermudagrass.
