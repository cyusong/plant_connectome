['15635403', 'Local accumulation of the plant growth regulator auxin mediates pattern formation  in Arabidopsis roots and influences outgrowth and development of lateral root-  and shoot-derived primordia. However, it has remained unclear how auxin can  simultaneously regulate patterning and organ outgrowth and how its distribution  is stabilized in a primordium-specific manner. Here we show that five PIN genes  collectively control auxin distribution to regulate cell division and cell  expansion in the primary root. Furthermore, the joint action of these genes has  an important role in pattern formation by focusing the auxin maximum and  restricting the expression domain of PLETHORA (PLT) genes, major determinants for  root stem cell specification. In turn, PLT genes are required for PIN gene  transcription to stabilize the auxin maximum at the distal root tip. Our data  reveal an interaction network of auxin transport facilitators and root fate  determinants that control patterning and growth of the root primordium.', '2005 Jan 6', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature03184', 'Scheres']
