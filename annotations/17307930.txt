In response to iron deficiency, cyanobacteria synthesize the iron stress-induced chlorophyll binding protein IsiA. This protein protects cyanobacterial cells against iron stress. It has been proposed that the protective role of IsiA is related to a blue light-induced nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) mechanism. In iron-replete cyanobacterial cell cultures, strong blue light is known to induce a mechanism that dissipates excess absorbed energy in the phycobilisome, the extramembranal antenna of cyanobacteria. In this photoprotective mechanism, the soluble Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) plays an essential role. Here, we demonstrate that in iron-starved cells, blue light is unable to quench fluorescence in the absence of the phycobilisomes or the OCP. By contrast, the absence of IsiA does not affect the induction of fluorescence quenching or its recovery. We conclude that in cyanobacteria grown under iron starvation conditions, the blue light-induced nonphotochemical quenching involves the phycobilisome OCP-related energy dissipation mechanism and not IsiA. IsiA, however, does seem to protect the cells from the stress generated by iron starvation, initially by increasing the size of the photosystem I antenna. Subsequently, the IsiA converts the excess energy absorbed by the phycobilisomes into heat through a mechanism different from the dynamic and reversible light-induced NPQ processes.
