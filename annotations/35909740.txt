Soil salinity is an important abiotic stress factor that seriously affects the crop growth and yield. Use of plant-derived microorganisms is a promising strategy to alleviate salt stress. In a previous study, the endophytic strain <i>Bacillus altitudinis</i> WR10 isolated from wheat roots showed high salt resistance. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of WR10 in improving the salt tolerance of wheat and its potential mechanisms using a hydroponic test. Under salt stress, WR10 inoculation significantly increased the lengths and dry weights of the roots and shoots, indicating that WR10 improves wheat salt tolerance at the seedling stage. WR10 inoculation significantly reduced Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation and enhanced K<sup>+</sup>, P, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in salt-stressed plants, which can be attributed to the upregulated gene expression of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase as well as the P-solubilizing and biofilm-producing characteristics of WR10. At the transcriptional level, L-ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione (GSH) synthetase related to GSH biosynthesis, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes (CYP73A, 4CL, and CAD) were significantly upregulated, whereas those of GSH metabolism genes (glutathione S-transferase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase) were significantly downregulated in WR10-applied wheat roots under salt stress. These changes increased the APX activity and GSH levels and resulted in a decrease in hydrogen peroxide levels. Additionally, a decrease in proline content was observed in WR10-inoculated plants under salt stress because of WR10-induced upregulation of proline dehydrogenase gene expression. These results provide supporting evidence that WR10 improves wheat salt tolerance via more than one mechanism and open a window of opportunity for WR10 application in salinized soil.
