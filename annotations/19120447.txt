['19120447', 'An approach based on an in silico analysis predicted that CYP77A4, a cytochrome  P450 that so far has no identified function, might be a fatty acid-metabolizing  enzyme. CYP77A4 was heterologously expressed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain  (WAT11) engineered for cytochrome P450 expression. Lauric acid (C(12:0)) was  converted into a mixture of hydroxylauric acids when incubated with microsomes  from yeast expressing CYP77A4. A variety of physiological C(18) fatty acids were  tested as potential substrates. Oleic acid (cis-Delta(9)C(18:1)) was converted  into a mixture of omega-4- to omega-7-hydroxyoleic acids (75%) and  9,10-epoxystearic acid (25%). Linoleic acid (cis,cis-Delta(9),Delta(12)C(18:2))  was exclusively converted into 12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9-enoic acid, which was then  converted into diepoxide after epoxidation of the Delta(9) unsaturation. Chiral  analysis showed that 9,10-epoxystearic acid was a mixture of 9S/10R and 9R/10S in  the ratio 33 : 77, whereas 12,13-epoxyoctadeca-9-enoic acid presented a strong  enantiomeric excess in favor of 12S/13R, which represented 90% of the epoxide.  Neither stearic acid (C(18:0)) nor linolelaidic acid  (trans,trans-Delta(9),Delta(12)C(18:2)) was metabolized, showing that CYP77A4  requires a double bond, in the cis configuration, to metabolize C(18) fatty  acids. CYP77A4 was also able to catalyze the in vitro formation of the three  mono-epoxides of alpha-linolenic acid  (cis,cis,cis-Delta(9),Delta(12),Delta(15)C(18:3)), previously described as  antifungal compounds. Epoxides generated by CYP77A4 are further metabolized to  the corresponding diols by epoxide hydrolases located in microsomal and cytosolic  subcellular fractions from Arabidopsis thaliana. The concerted action of CYP77A4  with epoxide hydrolases and hydroxylases allows the production of compounds  involved in plant-pathogen interactions, suggesting a possible role for CYP77A4  in plant defense.', '2009 Feb', 'FEBS J', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06819.x', 'Pinot']
