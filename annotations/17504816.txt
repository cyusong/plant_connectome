We expressed recombinant Arabidopsis myosin XI (MYA1), in which the motor domain of MYA1 was connected to an artificial lever arm composed of triple helical repeats of Dictyostelium alpha-actinin, in order to understand its motor activity and intracellular function. The V(max) and K(actin) of the actin-activated Mg(2+) ATPase activity of the recombinant MYA1 were 50.7 Pi head(-1) s(-1) and 30.2 microM, respectively, at 25 degrees C. The recombinant MYA1 could translocate actin filament at the maximum velocity of 1.8 microm s(-1) at 25 degrees C in the in vitro motility assay. The value corresponded to a motility of 3.2 microm s(-1) for native MYA1 if we consider the difference in the lever arm length, and this value was very close to the velocity of cytoplasmic streaming in Arabidopsis hypocotyl epidermal cells. The extent of inhibition by ADP of the motility of MYA1 was similar to that of the well-known processive motor, myosin V, suggesting that MYA1 is a processive motor. The dissociation rate of the actin-MYA1-ADP complex induced by ATP (73.5 s(-1)) and the V(max) value of the actin-activated Mg(2+) ATPase activity revealed that MYA1 stays in the actin-bound state for about 70% of its mechanochemical cycle time. This high ratio of actin-bound states is also a characteristic of processive motors. Our results strongly suggest that MYA1 is a processive motor and involved in vesicle transport and/or cytoplasmic streaming.
