<i>Phytophthora infestans</i> causes the severe late blight disease of potato. During its infection process, <i>P. infestans</i> delivers hundreds of RXLR (Arg-x-Leu-Arg, x behalf of any one amino acid) effectors to manipulate processes in its hosts, creating a suitable environment for invasion and proliferation. Several effectors interact with host proteins to suppress host immunity and inhibit plant growth. However, little is known about how <i>P. infestans</i> regulates the host transcriptome. Here, we identified an RXLR effector, <i>PITG_15718.2</i>, which is upregulated and maintains a high expression level throughout the infection. Stable transgenic potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) lines expressing <i>PITG_15718.2</i> show enhanced leaf colonization by <i>P. infestans</i> and reduced vegetative growth. We further investigated the transcriptional changes between three <i>PITG_15718.2</i> transgenic lines and the wild type Désirée by using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Compared with Désirée, 190 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 158 upregulated genes and 32 downregulated genes in <i>PITG_15718.2</i> transgenic lines. Eight upregulated and nine downregulated DEGs were validated by real-time RT-PCR, which showed a high correlation with the expression level identified by RNA-Seq. These DEGs will help to explore the mechanism of PITG_15718.2-mediated immunity and growth inhibition in the future.
