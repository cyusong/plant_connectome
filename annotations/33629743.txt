Iron (Fe) deficiency chlorosis (IDC) affects the growth of several crops, especially when growing in alkaline soils. The application of synthetic Fe-chelates is one of the most commonly used strategies in IDC amendment, despite their associated negative environmental impacts. In a previous work, the Fe-chelate tris(3-hydroxy-1-(H)-2-methyl-4-pyridinonate) iron(III) [Fe(mpp)<sub>3</sub> ] has shown great potential for alleviating IDC in soybean (Glycine max) in the early stages of plant development under hydroponic conditions. Herein, its efficacy was verified under soil conditions in soybean grown from seed to full maturity. Chlorophyll levels, plant growth, root and shoot mineral accumulation (K, Mg, Ca, Na, P, Mn, Zn, Ni, and Co) and FERRITIN expression were accessed at V5 phenological stage. Compared to a commonly used Fe chelate, FeEDDHA, supplementation with [Fe(mpp)<sub>3</sub> ] led to a 29% higher relative chlorophyll content, 32% higher root biomass, 36% higher trifoliate Fe concentration, and a twofold increase in leaf FERRITIN gene expression. [Fe(mpp)<sub>3</sub> ] supplementation also resulted in increased accumulation of P, K, Zn, and Co. At full maturity, the remaining plants were harvested and [Fe(mpp)<sub>3</sub> ] application led to a 32% seed yield increase when compared to FeEDDHA. This is the first report on the use of [Fe(mpp)<sub>3</sub> ] under alkaline soil conditions for IDC correction, and we show that its foliar application has a longer-lasting effect than FeEDDHA, induces efficient root responses, and promotes the uptake of other nutrients.
