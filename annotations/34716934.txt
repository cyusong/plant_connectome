Increasing soil salinization largely impacts crop yield worldwide. To deal with salinity stress, plants exhibit an array of responses, including root system architecture remodelling. Here, we review recent progress in physiological, developmental and cellular mechanisms of root growth responses to salinity. Most recent research in modulation of root branching, root tropisms, as well as in root cell wall modifications under salinity stress, is discussed in the context of the contribution of these responses to overall plant performance. We highlight the power of natural variation approaches revealing novel potential pathways responsible for differences in root salt stress responses. Together, these new findings promote our understanding of how salt shapes the root phenotype, which may provide potential avenues for engineering crops with better yield and survival in saline soils.
