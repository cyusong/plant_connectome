Plasma membrane NADPH oxidases (NOXs), also named respiratory burst oxidase homologues (Rbohs), are critical generators of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which as signal molecules regulate growth and development, and adaptation to various biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. NOXs-dependent ROS production is frequently induced by diverse phytohormones. The ROS commonly function downstream of, and interplay with hormone signalings, coordinately modulating plant development and stress tolerance. In this review, we summarize recent advances on the roles and molecular mechanisms of Rbohs in mediating signalings of multiple hormones including auxin, gibberellins, abscisic acid, ethylene and brassinosteroids in plants.
