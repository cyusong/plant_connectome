Aquaporins play a major role in plant water uptake at both optimal and environmentally stressed conditions. However, the functional specificity of aquaporins under cold remains obscure. To get a better insight to the role of aquaporins in cold acclimation and freezing tolerance, we took an integrated approach of physiology, transcript profiling and cell biology in Arabidopsis thaliana. Cold acclimation resulted in specific upregulation of PIP1;4 and PIP2;5 aquaporin (plasma membrane intrinsic proteins) expression, and immunoblotting analysis confirmed the increase in amount of PIP2;5 protein and total amount of PIPs during cold acclimation, suggesting that PIP2;5 plays a major role in tackling the cold milieu. Although single mutants of pip1;4 and pip2;5 or their double mutant showed no phenotypic changes in freezing tolerance, they were more sensitive in root elongation and cell survival response under freezing stress conditions compared with the wild type. Consistently, a single mutation in either PIP1;4 or PIP2;5 altered the expression of a number of aquaporins both at the transcriptional and translational levels. Collectively, our results suggest that aquaporin members including PIP1;4 and PIP2;5 function in concert to regulate cold acclimation and freezing tolerance responses.
