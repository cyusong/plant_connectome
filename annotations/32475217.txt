The transcription factor <i>MYB15</i> plays an important role in grape basal immunity, and its promoter can be used as a potential target in resistance breeding. However, the regulatory mechanisms of <i>cis</i>-elements in its promoter region under a variety of stresses remain unclear. In this study, we identified some putative <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements present upstream of <i>MYB15</i> in <i>Vitis quinquangularis</i> Shanyang (<i>pVqMYB15</i>_SY) and subsequently characterized the function of these elements using reporter assays. Our results showed that TCA-elements 1 and 2, ABRE, MYC and 3-AF1 binding site 1 are key <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements in <i>pVqMYB15</i>_SY and play important roles in plant bio/abiotic stress resistance.
