Accumulation of glucosinolates, a class of defense-related secondary metabolites found almost exclusively in the Capparales, is induced in response to a variety of biological stresses. It is often assumed that elevated glucosinolate levels result from de novo biosynthesis, but glucosinolate transport from other parts of the plant to the site of herbivory or pathogen infection can also contribute to the defense response. Several studies with Arabidopsis and other crucifers have demonstrated that glucosinolates from vegetative tissue are transported to developing seeds. Here we discuss evidence that long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates are transported to the site of herbivory in response to Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) feeding on Arabidopsis.
