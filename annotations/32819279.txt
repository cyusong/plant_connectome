Hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is involved in regulating physiological processes in plants. We investigated how H<sub>2</sub>S ameliorates iron (Fe) deficiency in soybean (Glycine max L.) seedlings. Multidisciplinary approaches including physiological, biochemical and molecular, and transcriptome methods were used to investigate the H<sub>2</sub>S role in regulating Fe availability in soybean seedlings. Our results showed that H<sub>2</sub>S completely prevented leaf interveinal chlorosis and caused an increase in soybean seedling biomass under Fe deficiency conditions. Moreover, H<sub>2</sub>S decreased the amount of root-bound apoplastic Fe and increased the Fe content in leaves and roots by regulating the ferric-chelate reductase (FCR) activities and Fe homeostasis- and sulphur metabolism-related gene expression levels, thereby promoting photosynthesis in soybean seedlings. In addition, H<sub>2</sub>S changed the plant hormone concentrations by modulating plant hormone-related gene expression abundances in soybean seedlings grown in Fe-deficient solution. Furthermore, organic acid biosynthesis and related genes expression also played a vital role in modulating the H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated alleviation of Fe deficiency in soybean seedlings. Our results indicated that Fe deficiency was alleviated by H<sub>2</sub>S through enhancement of Fe acquisition and assimilation, thereby regulating plant hormones and organic acid synthesis in plants.
