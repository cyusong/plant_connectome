Anion channels/transporters appear as key players in signaling pathways leading to the adaptation of plant cells to abiotic and biotic environmental stresses, in the control of metabolism and in the maintenance of electrochemical gradients. Focusing on the most recent advances, this review aims at providing a description of the role of these channels in various physiological functions such as control of stomatal movements, plant-pathogen interaction, xylem loading, compartmentalization of metabolites and coupling with proton gradients. These functions have been demonstrated by a combination of electrophysiology, pharmacology and genetics approaches, the key issue being to identify the corresponding proteins and genes.
