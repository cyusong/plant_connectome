A general distribution of tandem repeats (TRs) in the wheat genome was predicted and a new web page combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments, and the newly developed Oligo probes will improve the resolution for wheat chromosome identification. Comprehensive sequence analysis of tandem repeats (TR) in the wheat reference genome permits discovery and application of TRs for chromosome identification. Genome-wide localization of TRs was identified in the reference sequences of Chinese Spring using Tandem Repeat Finder (TRF). A database of repeats unit size, array number, and physical coverage length of TRs in the wheat genome was built. The distribution of TRs occupied 3-5% of the wheat chromosomes, with non-random dispersal across the A, B, and D genomes. Three classes of TRs surrounding the predicted genes were compared. An optimized computer-assisted website page B2DSC was constructed for the general distribution and chromosomally enriched zones of TR sequences to be displayed graphically. The physical distribution of predicted TRs in the wheat genome by B2DSC matched well with the corresponding hybridization signals obtained with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We developed 20 oligonucleotide probes representing 20-60 bp lengths of high copy number of TRs and verified by FISH. An integrated physical map of TR-Oligo probes for wheat chromosome identification was constructed. Our results suggest that the combination of both molecular cytogenetics and genomic research will significantly benefit wheat breeding through chromosome manipulation and engineering.
