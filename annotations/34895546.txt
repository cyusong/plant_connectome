['34895546', 'The MEDIATOR complex influences the transcription of genes acting as a RNA pol II  co-activator. The MED16 subunit has been related to low phosphate sensing in  roots, but how it influences the overall plant growth and root development  remains unknown. In this study, we compared the root growth of Arabidopsis  wild-type (WT), and two alleles of MED16 (med16-2 and med16-3) mutants in vitro.  The MED16 loss-of-function seedlings showed longer primary roots with higher cell  division capacity of meristematic cells, and an increased number of lateral roots  than WT plants, which correlated with improved biomass accumulation. The auxin  response reported by DR5:GFP fluorescence was comparable in WT and med16-2 root  tips, but strongly decreased in pericycle cells and lateral root primordia in the  mutants. Dose-response analysis supplementing indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), or the  auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), indicated normal  responses to auxin in the med16-2 and med16-3 mutants regarding primary root  growth and lateral root formation, but strong resistance to NPA in primary roots,  which could be correlated with cell division and elongation. Expression analysis  of pPIN1::PIN1::GFP, pPIN3::PIN3::GFP, pIAA14:GUS, pIAA28:GUS and 35S:MED16-GFP  suggests that MED16 could mediate auxin signaling. Our data imply that an altered  auxin response in the med16 mutants is not necessarily deleterious for overall  growth and developmental patterning and may instead directly regulate basic  cellular programmes.', '2022 Jan', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.111117', 'Lopez-Bucio']
