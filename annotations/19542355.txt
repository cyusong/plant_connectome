Plant organs are generated from meristems throughout development. Patterning and elaboration of organ primordia occur as a result of organized cell division and expansion, processes that are likely to be controlled, in part, by meristem-derived signals. Communication between the meristem and lateral organs is crucial for meristem maintenance and organ patterning, and organ boundaries are thought to be important for mediating this communication. Arabidopsis thaliana LATERAL ORGAN FUSION1 (LOF1) encodes a MYB-domain transcription factor that is expressed in organ boundaries. lof1 mutants display defects in organ separation as a result of abnormal cell division and expansion during early boundary formation. lof1 mutants also fail to form accessory shoot meristems. Mutations in the closely related LATERAL ORGAN FUSION2 (LOF2) gene enhance the lof1 phenotype, such that lof1 lof2 double mutants display additional fusion defects. Genetic interactions with the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON genes CUC2 and CUC3 revealed a role for LOF1 in both organ separation and axillary meristem formation. Expression of the meristem determinant STM was reduced in lof1 mutant paraclade junctions and lof1 enhanced the weak stm-10 mutant, such that double mutants had severe defects in meristem maintenance and organ separation. Our data implicate LOF1 and LOF2 in boundary specification, meristem initiation and maintenance, and organ patterning.
