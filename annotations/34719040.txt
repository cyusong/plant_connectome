Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are among the most important macronutrients for plant growth and development, and the most widely used as fertilizers. Understanding how plants sense and respond to N and P deficiency is essential to optimize and reduce the use of chemical fertilizers. Strigolactones (SLs) are phytohormones acting as modulators and sensors of plant responses to P deficiency. In the present work, we assess the potential role of SLs in N starvation and in the N-P signalling interplay. Physiological, transcriptional and metabolic responses were analysed in wild-type and SL-deficient tomato plants grown under different P and N regimes, and in plants treated with a short-term pulse of the synthetic SL analogue 2'-epi-GR24. The results evidence that plants prioritize N over P status by affecting SL biosynthesis. We also show that SLs modulate the expression of key regulatory genes of phosphate and nitrate signalling pathways, including the N-P integrators PHO2 and NIGT1/HHO. The results support a key role for SLs as sensors during early plant responses to both N and phosphate starvation and mediating the N-P signalling interplay, indicating that SLs are involved in more physiological processes than so far proposed.
