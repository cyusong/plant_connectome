Phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC), a promising long-term biogeochemical carbon sequestration mode, plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle and the regulation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Previous studies mostly focused on the estimation of the content and storage of PhytOC, while it remains unclear about how the management practices affect the PhytOC content and whether it varies with stand age. Moso bamboo (<i>Phyllostachys heterocycla</i> var. <i>pubescens</i>) has a great potential in carbon sequestration and is rich in PhytOC. Here, we selected four management treatments, including control (CK), compound fertilization (CF), silicon (Si) fertilization (SiF) (monosilicic acid can form phytoliths through silicification), and cut to investigate the variation of phytoliths and PhytOC contents in soil, leaves, and litters, and their storage in Moso bamboo forests. In soil, the SiF fertilizer treatment significantly (<i>P</i> < 0.05) increased phytolith content, PhytOC content, and storage compared to CK, while there were no significant differences between the treatments of CF and cut. In leaf, compared with CK, phytolith content of the second-degree leaves under SiF and the first-degree leaves under cut treatment significantly increased, and the three treatments significantly increased PhytOC storage for leaves with three age classes. In litter, the phytolith and PhytOC contents under the three treatments were not significantly different from that under the CK treatment. The PhytOC storage increased by 19.33% under SiF treatment, but significantly decreased by 40.63% under the CF treatment. For the entire Moso bamboo forest ecosystems, PhytOC storage of all the three management treatments increased compared with CK, with the largest increase by 102% under the SiF treatment. The effects of management practices on the accumulation of PhytOC varied with age. Our study implied that Si fertilization has a greater potential to significantly promote the capacity of sequestration of carbon in Moso bamboo forests.
