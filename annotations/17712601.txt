The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains two nearly identical genes which encode proteins showing similarity with the yeast metal chaperone Cox19p, involved in cytochrome c oxidase biogenesis. One of these genes (AtCOX19-1) produces two transcript forms that arise from an alternative splicing event and encode proteins with different N-terminal portions. Both AtCOX19 isoforms are imported into mitochondria in vitro and are found attached to the inner membrane facing the intermembrane space. The smaller AtCOX19-1 isoform, but not the larger one, is able to restore growth on non-fermentable carbon sources when expressed in a yeast cox19 null mutant. AtCOX19 transcript levels increase by treatment with copper or compounds that produce reactive oxygen species. Young roots and anthers are highly stained in AtCOX19-1::GUS plants. Expression in leaves is only observed when cuts are produced, suggesting an induction by wounding. Infection of plants with the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato also induces AtCOX19 gene expression. The results suggest that AtCOX19 genes encode functional homologues of the yeast metal chaperone. Induction by biotic and abiotic stress factors may indicate a relevant role of this protein in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase to replace damaged forms of the enzyme or a more general role in the response of plants to stress.
