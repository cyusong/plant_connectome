['15990873', 'Arabidopsis MAP kinase 4 (MPK4) functions as a regulator of pathogen defense  responses, because it is required for both repression of salicylic acid  (SA)-dependent resistance and for activation of jasmonate (JA)-dependent defense  gene expression. To understand MPK4 signaling mechanisms, we used yeast  two-hybrid screening to identify the MPK4 substrate MKS1. Analyses of transgenic  plants and genome-wide transcript profiling indicated that MKS1 is required for  full SA-dependent resistance in mpk4 mutants, and that overexpression of MKS1 in  wild-type plants is sufficient to activate SA-dependent resistance, but does not  interfere with induction of a defense gene by JA. Further yeast two-hybrid  screening revealed that MKS1 interacts with the WRKY transcription factors WRKY25  and WRKY33. WRKY25 and WRKY33 were shown to be in vitro substrates of MPK4, and a  wrky33 knockout mutant was found to exhibit increased expression of the  SA-related defense gene PR1. MKS1 may therefore contribute to MPK4-regulated  defense activation by coupling the kinase to specific WRKY transcription factors.', '2005 Jul 20', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7600737', 'Mundy']
