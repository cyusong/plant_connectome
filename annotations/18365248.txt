Trehalose plays a protective role in yeast and microorganisms under abiotic stresses. However, little is known about its role in higher plants when subjected to environmental challenges. A systematic search of rice databases discovered a large TPS/TPP gene family in the rice genome, which is similar to that found in Arabidopsis thaliana, especially in the gene family structure. Expression analysis demonstrated that OsTPP1 was initially and transiently up-regulated after salt, osmotic and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments but slowly up-regulated under cold stress. OsTPP1 overexpression in rice enhanced tolerance to salt and cold stress. Analysis of the overexpression lines revealed that OsTPP1 triggered abiotic stress response genes, which suggests a possible transcriptional regulation pathway in stress induced reprogramming initiated by OsTPP1. The current study revealed the mechanism of an OsTPP gene involved in stress tolerance in rice and also suggested the use of OsTPP1 in abiotic stress engineering of crops.
