['9490740', 'The recessive rga mutation is able to partially suppress phenotypic defects of  the Arabidopsis gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic mutant ga1-3. Defects in stem  elongation, flowering time, and leaf abaxial trichome initiation are suppressed  by rga. This indicates that RGA is a negative regulator of the GA signal  transduction pathway. We have identified 10 additional alleles of rga from a  fast-neutron mutagenized ga1-3 population and used them to isolate the RGA gene  by genomic subtraction. Our data suggest that RGA may be functioning as a  transcriptional regulator. RGA was found to be a member of the VHIID regulatory  family, which includes the radial root organizing gene SCARECROW and another GA  signal transduction repressor, GAI. RGA and GAI proteins share a high degree of  homology, but their N termini are more divergent. The presence of several  structural features, including homopolymeric serine and threonine residues, a  putative nuclear localization signal, leucine heptad repeats, and an LXXLL motif,  indicates that the RGA protein may be a transcriptional regulator that represses  the GA response. In support of the putative nuclear localization signal, we  demonstrated that a transiently expressed green fluorescent protein-RGA fusion  protein is localized to the nucleus in onion epidermal cells. Because the rga  mutation abolished the high level of expression of the GA biosynthetic gene GA4  in the ga1-3 mutant background, we conclude that RGA may also play a role in  controlling GA biosynthesis.', '1998 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.2.155', 'Sun']
