Senescence is a vital aspect of fruit life cycles, and directly affects fruit quality and resistance to pathogens. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), as the primary mediators of oxidative damage in plants, are involved in senescence. Mitochondria are the main ROS and free radical source. Oxidative damage to mitochondrial proteins caused by ROS is implicated in the process of senescence, and a number of senescence-related disorders in a variety of organisms. However, the specific sites of ROS generation in mitochondria remain largely unknown. Recent discoveries have ascertained that fruit senescence is greatly related to ROS and incidental oxidative damage of mitochondrial protein. Special mitochondrial proteins involved in fruit senescence have been identified as the targets of ROS. We focus in discussion on our recent advances in exploring the mechanisms of how ROS regulate fruit senescence and fungal pathogenicity.
