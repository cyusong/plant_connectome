<i>Mikania micrantha</i>, recognized as one of the world's top 10 pernicious weeds, is a rapidly spreading tropical vine that has invaded the coastal areas of South China, causing serious economic losses and environmental damage. Rapid stem growth is an important feature of <i>M. micrantha</i> which may be related to its greater number of genes involved in auxin signaling and transport pathways and its ability to synthesize more auxin under adverse conditions to promote or maintain stem growth. Plant growth and development is closely connected to the regulation of endogenous hormones, especially the polar transport and asymmetric distribution of auxin. The PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carrier gene family plays a key role in the polar transport of auxin and then regulates the growth of different plant tissues, which could indicate that the rapid growth of <i>M. micrantha</i> is closely related to this PIN-dependent auxin regulation. In this study, 11 PIN genes were identified and the phylogenetic relationship and structural compositions of the gene family in <i>M. micrantha</i> were analyzed by employing multiple bioinformatic methods. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the PIN proteins could be divided into five distinct clades. The structural analysis revealed that three putative types of PIN (canonical, noncanonical and semi-canonical) exist among the proteins according to the length and the composition of the hydrophilic domain. The majority of the PINs were involved in the process of axillary bud differentiation and stem response under abiotic stress, indicating that <i>M. micrantha</i> may regulate its growth, development and stress response by regulating PIN expression in the axillary bud and stem, which may help explain its strong growth ability and environmental adaptability. Our study emphasized the structural features and stress response patterns of the PIN gene family and provided useful insights for further study into the molecular mechanism of auxin-regulated growth and control in <i>M. micrantha</i>.
