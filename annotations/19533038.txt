['19533038', 'Pyrophosphate: fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (PFP) catalyzes the  reversible interconversion of fructose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate,  a key step in the regulation of the metabolic flux toward glycolysis or  gluconeogenesis. To examine the role of PFP in plant growth, we have generated  transgenic Arabidopsis plants that either overexpress or repress Arabidopsis PFP  sub-unit genes. The overexpressing lines displayed increased PFP activity and  slightly faster growth relative to wild type plants, although their  photosynthetic activities and the levels of metabolites appeared not to have  significantly changed. In contrast, the RNAi lines showed significantly retarded  growth in parallel with the reduced PFP activity. Analysis of photosynthetic  activity revealed that the growth retardation phenotype of the RNAi lines was  accompanied by the reduced rates of CO(2) assimilation. Microarray analysis of  our transgenic plants further revealed that the altered expression of AtPFPbeta  affects the expression of several genes involved in diverse physiological  processes. Our current data thus suggest that PFP is important in carbohydrate  metabolism and other cellular processes.', '2009 Jun 30', 'Mol Cells', '10.1007/s10059-009-0085-0', 'Hahn']
