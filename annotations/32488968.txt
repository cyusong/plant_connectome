Drought is an environmental factor that can severely influence plant development and distribution, and greatly affect the yield and economic value of crops. We characterized CmBBX19, a BBX family subgroup IV member gene, from the transcriptome database of Chrysanthemum morifolium in response to drought stress. Drought stress and ABA treatments downregulated the expression of CmBBX19. We generated CmBBX19-overexpressing (CmBBX19-OX) lines and CmBBX19-suppressing lines (CmBBX19-RNAi), and found that suppressed expression of CmBBX19 led to enhanced drought tolerance compared with the wild-type (WT) controls, while CmBBX19-OX lines exhibited reduced drought tolerance. Downstream gene analysis showed that CmBBX19 modulates drought tolerance mainly through inducing changes in the expression of ABA-dependent pathway genes, including protective protein, redox balance and cell wall biogenesis genes, such as responsive to ABA 18, peroxidase 12, and cellulose synthase-like protein G2. Moreover, CmBBX19 was shown to interact with CmABF3, a master ABA signaling component, to suppress expression of these downstream genes. We conclude that BBX19-ABF3 module functions in the regulation of drought tolerance of chrysanthemum through an ABA-dependent pathway.
