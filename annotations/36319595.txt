Powdery mildew (Pm), caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt), is one of the most important wheat diseases. Heavy-metal-associated isoprenylated plant protein (HIPP1) has been proved playing important roles in response to biotic and a biotic stress. In present study, we proved HIPP1-V from Haynalidia villosa is a positive regulator in Pm resistance. HIPP1-V was rapidly induced by Bgt. Transiently or stably heterologous overexpressing HIPP1-V in wheat suppressed the haustorium formation and enhanced Pm resistance. HIPP1-V isoprenylation was critical for plasma membrane (PM) localization, interaction with E3-ligase CMPG1-V and function in Pm resistance. Bgt infection recruited the isoprenylated HIPP1-V and CMPG1s on PM; blocking the HIPP1 isoprenylation reduced such recruitment and compromised the resistance of OE-CMPG1-V and OE-HIPP1-V. Overexpressing HIPP1-VC<sup>148G</sup> could not enhance Pm resistance. These indicated the Pm resistance was dependent on HIPP1-V's isoprenylation. DGEs related to the ROS and SA pathways were remarkably enriched in OE-HIPP1-V, revealing their involvement in Pm resistance. Our results provide evidence on the important role of protein isoprenylation in plant defense.
