NAC transcription factors are widespread in the plant kingdom and play essential roles in the transcriptional regulation of defense responses. In this study, we isolated a novel NAC transcription factor gene, TaNAC30, from a cDNA library constructed from wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants inoculated with the stripe rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). TaNAC30 contains a typical NAM domain and localizes to the nucleus. Yeast one-hybrid assays revealed that TaNAC30 exhibits transcriptional activity and that its C-terminus is necessary for the activation of transcription. Expression of TaNAC30 increased when host plants were infected with a virulent race (CYR31) of the rust fungus Pst. Silencing of TaNAC30 by virus-induced gene silencing inhibited colonization of the virulent Pst isolate CYR31. Moreover, detailed histological analyses showed that silencing of TaNAC30 enhanced resistance to Pst by inducing a significant increase in the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> . Finally, we overexpressed TaNAC30 in fission yeast and determined that cell viability was severely reduced in TaNAC30-transformed cells grown on medium containing H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> . These results suggest that TaNAC30 negatively regulates plant resistance in a compatible wheat-Pst interaction.
