['16339850', 'CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that represses  photomorphogenesis in the dark. Therefore, proteins interacting with COP1 could  be important regulators of light-dependent development. Here, we identify  CONSTANS-LIKE3 (COL3) as a novel interaction partner of COP1. A green fluorescent  protein-COL3 fusion protein colocalizes with COP1 to nuclear speckles when  transiently expressed in plant cells. This localization requires the B-box  domains in COL3, indicating a novel function of this domain. A loss-of-function  col3 mutant has longer hypocotyls in red light and in short days. Unlike  constans, the col3 mutant flowers early and shows a reduced number of lateral  branches in short days. The mutant also exhibits reduced formation of lateral  roots. The col3 mutation partially suppresses the cop1 and deetiolated1 (det1)  mutations in the dark, suggesting that COL3 acts downstream of both of these  repressors. However, the col3 mutation exerts opposing effects on cop1 and det1  in terms of lateral roots and anthocyanin accumulation, suggesting that COL3 also  has activities that are independent of COP1 and DET1. In conclusion, we have  identified COL3 as a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis that acts  downstream of COP1 but can promote lateral root development independently of COP1  and also function as a daylength-sensitive regulator of shoot branching.', '2006 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.038182', 'Holm']
