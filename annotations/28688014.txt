Proteins involved in membrane transport and trafficking, stress and defense, iron uptake and metabolism, as well as proteolytic enzymes, were remarkably up-regulated in the salinity-tolerant strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Excessive concentration of NaCl in the environment can cause adverse effects on plants and microalgae. Successful adaptation of plants to long-term salinity stress requires complex cellular adjustments at different levels from molecular, biochemical and physiological processes. In this study, we developed a salinity-tolerant strain (ST) of the model unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, capable of growing in medium containing 300 mM NaCl. Comparative proteomic analyses were performed to assess differential protein expression pattern between the ST and the control progenitor cells. Proteins involved in membrane transport and trafficking, stress and defense, iron uptake and metabolism, as well as protein degradation, were remarkably up-regulated in the ST cells, suggesting the importance of these processes in acclimation mechanisms to salinity stress. Moreover, 2-DE-based proteomic also revealed putative salinity-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs) on several important housekeeping proteins. Discussions were made regarding the roles of these differentially expressed proteins and the putative PTMs in cellular adaptation to long-term salinity stress.
