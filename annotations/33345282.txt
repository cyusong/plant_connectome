Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a vital role in coordinating physiological processes during fresh fruit ripening. Binding of ABA to receptors facilitates the interaction and inhibition of type 2C phosphatase (PP2C) co-receptors. However, the exact mechanism of PP2C during fruit ripening is unclear. In this study, we determined the role of the tomato ABA co-receptor type 2C phosphatase SlPP2C3, a negative regulator of ABA signaling and fruit ripening. SlPP2C3 selectively interacted with monomeric ABA receptors and SlSnRK2.8 kinase in both yeast and tobacco epidermal cells. Expression of SlPP2C3 was ABA-inducible, which was negatively correlated with fruit ripening. Tomato plants with suppressed SlPP2C3 expression exhibited enhanced sensitivity to ABA, while plants overexpressing SlPP2C3 were less sensitive to ABA. Importantly, lack of SlPP2C3 expression accelerated the onset of fruit ripening and affected fruit glossiness by altering the outer epidermis structure. There was a significant difference in the expression of cuticle-related genes in the pericarp between wild-type and SlPP2C3-suppressed lines based on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that SlPP2C3 plays an important role in the regulation of fruit ripening and fruit glossiness in tomato.
