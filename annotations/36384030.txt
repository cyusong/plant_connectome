Most of the <i>Pythium</i> species are pathogenic to a wide range of economically important crops and, sometimes, can even cause diseases in animals and humans. An exception is that the soil-inhabiting <i>P. oligandrum</i> is an effective biocontrol agent against a diverse suite of pathogens and promotes plant growth. In this work, we sequenced the whole genome of <i>P. oligandrum</i> PO-1, isolated from rhizosphere soils of Chinese <i>Angelica sinensis</i>, using a combination of long-read single-molecule real-time sequencing technology (Pacific Biosciences [PacBio]) and Illumina sequencing. The 2.5-Gb and 5.2-Gb bases were generated respectively. The sequencing depths were 93× with PacBio and 145× with Illumina sequencing. With the PacBio sequencing results further corrected by Illumina sequencing, the genome was assembled into 71 scaffolds with a total size of 39.10 Mb (N<sub>50</sub> = 1.45 Mb; L<sub>50</sub> = 9)and the longest scaffold is 3.49 Mb. Genome annotation identifies 15,632 protein-coding genes and 0.47 Mb of transposable elements. Our genomic assembly and annotation have been greatly improved compared with the already released three genomes of <i>P. oligandrum.</i> This genomic data will provide valuable information to understand the mechanism underlying its biocontrol potentials and will also facilitate the dissection of genome evolution and environmental adaptation within the genus <i>Pythium</i>.
