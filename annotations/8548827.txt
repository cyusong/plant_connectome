['8548827', 'The embryo of the flowering plant Arabidopsis develops by a regular pattern of  cell divisions and cell shape changes. Mutations in the KNOLLE (KN) gene affect  the rate and plane of cell divisions as well as cell morphology, resulting in  mutant seedlings with a disturbed radial organization of tissue layers. At the  cellular level, mutant embryos are characterized by incomplete cross walls and  enlarged cells with polyploid nuclei. The KN gene was isolated by positional  cloning. The predicted KN protein has similarity to syntaxins, a protein family  involved in vesicular trafficking. During embryogenesis, KN transcripts are  detected in patches of single cells or small cell groups. Our results suggest a  function for KN in cytokinesis.', '1996 Jan 12', 'Cell', '10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80993-9', 'Jurgens']
