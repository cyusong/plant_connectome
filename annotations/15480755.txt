['15480755', 'Plastids are known to be able to synthesize their own iron-sulfur clusters, but  the biochemical machinery responsible for this process is not known. In this  study it is investigated whether CpNifS, the chloroplastic NifS-like cysteine  desulfurase of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. is responsible for the release of  sulfur from cysteine for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in  chloroplasts. Using an in vitro reconstitution assay it was found that purified  CpNifS was sufficient for Fe-S cluster formation in ferredoxin in the presence of  cysteine and a ferrous iron salt. Antibody-depletion experiments using stromal  extract showed that CpNifS is also essential for the Fe-S cluster formation  activity of chloroplast stroma. The activity of CpNifS in the stroma was 50- to  80-fold higher than that of purified CpNifS on a per-protein basis, indicating  that other stromal factors cooperate in Fe-S cluster formation. When stromal  extract was separated on a gel-filtration column, most of the CpNifS eluted as a  dimer of 86 kDa, but a minor fraction of the stromal CpNifS eluted at a molecular  weight of approx. 600 kDa, suggesting the presence of a multi-protein complex.  The possible nature of the interacting proteins is discussed.', '2005 Feb', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-004-1388-1', 'Pilon']
