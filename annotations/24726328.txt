['24726328', 'Rrp6-mediated nuclear RNA surveillance tunes eukaryotic transcriptomes through  noncoding RNA degradation and mRNA quality control, including exosomal RNA decay  and transcript retention triggered by defective RNA processing. It is unclear  whether Rrp6 can positively regulate noncoding RNAs and whether RNA retention  occurs in normal cells. Here we report that AtRRP6L1, an Arabidopsis Rrp6-like  protein, controls RNA-directed DNA methylation through positive regulation of  noncoding RNAs. Discovered in a forward genetic screen, AtRRP6L1 mutations  decrease DNA methylation independently of exosomal RNA degradation. Accumulation  of Pol V-transcribed scaffold RNAs requires AtRRP6L1 that binds to RNAs in vitro  and in vivo. AtRRP6L1 helps retain Pol V-transcribed RNAs in chromatin to enable  their scaffold function. In addition, AtRRP6L1 is required for genome-wide Pol  IV-dependent siRNA production that may involve retention of Pol IV transcripts.  Our results suggest that AtRRP6L1 functions in epigenetic regulation by helping  with the retention of noncoding RNAs in normal cells.', '2014 May 8', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/j.molcel.2014.03.019', 'Zhu']
