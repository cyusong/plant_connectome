Fruit development is orchestrated by a complex network of interactions between hormone signaling pathways. The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) is known to regulate a diverse range of developmental processes; however, the mechanisms of GA action in perennial fruit species are yet to be elucidated. In the current study, a GA signaling gene PslSLY1, encoding a putative F-box protein that belongs to the SLY1 (SLEEPY1)/GID2 (gibberellin-insensitive dwarf2) gene family, was isolated from Japanese plum (Prunus salicina). PslSLY1 transcript abundance declined as fruit development progressed, along with potential negative feedback regulation of PslSLY1 by GA. Subcellular localization and protein-protein interaction assays suggested that PslSLY1 functions as an active GA signaling component that interacts with the ASK1 (Arabidopsis SKP1) subunit of an SCF-ubiquitin ligase complex and with PslDELLA repressors, in a GA-independent manner. By using a domain omission strategy, we illustrated that the F-box and C-terminal domains of PslSLY1 are essential for its interactions with the downstream GA signaling components. PslSLY1 overexpression in wild-type and Arabidopsissly1.10 mutant backgrounds resulted in a dramatic enhancement in overall plant growth, presumably due to triggered GA signaling. This includes germination characteristics, stem elongation, flower structure, and fertility. Overall, our findings shed new light on the GA strategy and signaling network in commercially important perennial crops.
