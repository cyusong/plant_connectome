Salinity is one of the most decisive environmental factors threatening the productivity of crop plants. Understanding the mechanisms of plant salt tolerance is critical to be able to maintain or improve crop yield under these adverse environmental conditions. Plant membranes act as biological barriers, protecting the contents of cells and organelles from biotic and abiotic stress, including salt stress. Alterations in membrane lipids in response to salinity have been observed in a number of plant species including both halophytes and glycophytes. Changes in membrane lipids can directly affect the properties of membrane proteins and activity of signaling molecules, adjusting the fluidity and permeability of membranes, and activating signal transduction pathways. In this review, we compile evidence on the salt stress responses of the major membrane lipids from different plant tissues, varieties, and species. The role of membrane lipids as signaling molecules in response to salinity is also discussed. Advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques have largely expanded our knowledge of salt-induced changes in lipids, however only a handful studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of membrane lipidome regulation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent works that have been carried out on lipid remodeling of plant membranes under salt treatment. Challenges and future perspectives in understanding the mechanisms of salt-induced changes to lipid metabolisms are proposed.
