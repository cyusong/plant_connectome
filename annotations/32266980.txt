Species coexistence in grasslands is regulated by several environmental factors and interactions with the soil microbial community. Here, the development of the Basidiomycetes fungus Agaricus arvensis, forming fairy rings, in a species-rich Mediterranean grassland, is described. Effects of the mycelial front on plants, fungi and bacteria were assessed by vegetation survey and next generation sequencing approaches. Our results showed a fungal-dependent shift in the community structure operated by a wave-like spread of fairy rings that decreased plant, fungal and bacterial diversity, indicating a detrimental effect of fairy rings on most species. The fairy rings induced successional processes in plants that enhanced the replacement of a community dominated by perennial plants with short-living and fast-growing plant species. In parallel, fungal and bacterial communities showed evident differences in species composition with several taxa associated within distinct sampling zone across the fairy rings. Notably, bacteria belonging to the Burkholderia genus and fungi of the genus Trichoderma increased in response to the advancing mycelium of A. arvensis. The profound changes in community composition and the overall increase in taxa diversity at ecosystemic scale suggest that fairy ring-forming fungi may act as ecosystem engineer species in Mediterranean grasslands.
