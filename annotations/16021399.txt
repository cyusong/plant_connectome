['16021399', 'Callose, a beta-1,3-glucan that is widespread in plants, is synthesized by  callose synthase. Arabidopsis thaliana contains a family of 12 putative callose  synthase genes (GSL1-12). The role of callose and of the individual genes in  plant development is still largely uncertain. We have now used TILLING and T-DNA  insertion mutants (gsl1-1, gsl5-2 and gsl5-3) to study the role of two closely  related and linked genes, GSL1 and GSL5, in sporophytic development and in  reproduction. Both genes are expressed in all parts of the plant. Sporophytic  development was nearly normal in gsl1-1 homozygotes and only moderately defective  in homozygotes for either of the two gsl5 alleles. On the other hand, plants that  were gsl1-1/+ gsl5/gsl5 were severely defective, with smaller leaves, shorter  roots and bolts and smaller flowers. Plants were fertile when the sporophytes had  either two wild-type GSL1 alleles, or one GSL5 allele in a gsl1-1 background, but  gsl1-1/+ gsl5/gsl5 plants produced an extremely reduced number of viable seeds. A  chromosome with mutations in both GSL1 and GSL5 rendered pollen infertile,  although such a chromosome could be transmitted via the egg. As a result, it was  not possible to obtain plants that were homozygous for mutations in both the GSL  genes. Pollen grain development was severely affected in double mutant plants.  Many pollen grains were collapsed and inviable in the gsl1-1/gsl1-1 gsl5/+ and  gsl1-1/+ gsl5/gsl5 plants. In addition, gsl1-1/+ gsl5/gsl5 plants produced  abnormally large pollen with unusual pore structures, and had problems with  tetrad dissociation. In this particular genotype, while the callose wall formed  around the pollen mother cells, no callose wall separated the resulting tetrads.  We conclude that GSL1 and GSL5 play important, but at least partially redundant  roles in both sporophytic development and in the development of pollen. They are  responsible for the formation of the callose wall that separates the microspores  of the tetrad, and also play a gametophytic role later in pollen grain  maturation. Other GSL genes may control callose formation at different steps  during pollen development.', '2005 Jun', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-005-4526-7', 'Cleland']
