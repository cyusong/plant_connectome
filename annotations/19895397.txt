gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a four-carbon non-protein amino acid presented in a wide range of organisms. In this study, a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) library was constructed using roots of a legume shrub, Caragana intermedia, with the combined treatment of 300 mm NaCl and 300 mm NaCl + 10 mm GABA. We obtained 224 GABA-regulated unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs) including signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, hormone biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and polyamine metabolism, etc. The key H(2)O(2)-generated genes, NADPH oxidase (CaGR60), peroxidase (CaGR61) and amine oxidase (CaGR62), were regulated at the mRNA level by 10 mm GABA, which clearly inhibited H(2)O(2) accumulation brought about by NaCl stress in roots and leaves with the observation of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. Similarly, 10 mm GABA also regulated the expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase (ACO) genes (CaGR30 and CaGR31) and ethylene production in NaCl-treated roots. Surprisingly, these H(2)O(2)-generated genes were enhanced at the mRNA level by a lower concentration of GABA, at 0.25 mm, but not other alternative nitrogen sources, and endogenous GABA accumulated largely just by the application of GABA at either concentration. Our results further proved that GABA, as a signal molecule, participates in regulating the expression of genes in plants under salt stress.
