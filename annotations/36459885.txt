The lateral organ boundaries domain (LBD), a unique family of transcription factors in higher plants, plays a key role in plant growth and development, and stress response. Here, we report on the novel lateral organ boundaries domain (LBD) gene PheLBD29, a nuclear localization protein that can bind the conserved GCCCCG sequence, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). PheLBD29 was highly expressed in blade leaf and significantly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG). Overexpression of PheLBD29 leads to small and abaxially rolled leaves in Arabidopsis, and anatomically, 35S:PheLBD29 Arabidopsis leaves showed transformation of adaxial cells into abaxial cells. Moreover, overexpression of PheLBD29 in Arabidopsis increased plant tolerance to drought stress, by accumulation of more soluble sugars, less malondialdehyde (MDA), and had lower REL levels under drought stress. Transient expression assay revealed PheLBD29 directly bound to the promoter region of RAB18. In addition, 35S:PheLBD29 Arabidopsis showed higher sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) than the wild type. Therefore, we conclude that PheLBD29 may participate in the ABA-dependent signaling pathway to improve drought tolerance. Our study provides new evidence for a Moso bamboo LBD protein regulatory module in leaf curvature and drought resistance.
