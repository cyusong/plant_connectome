['15659096', 'Chloroplast development requires coordinated expression of both nuclear- and  chloroplast-encoded genes. To better understand the roles played by  nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins in chloroplast biogenesis, we isolated an  Arabidopsis mutant, egy1-1, which has a dual phenotype, reduced chlorophyll  accumulation and abnormal hypocotyl gravicurvature. Subsequent map-based cloning  and DNA sequencing of the mutant gene revealed a 10-bp deletion in an EGY1 gene,  which encodes a 59-kDa metalloprotease that contains eight trans-membrane domains  at its C-terminus, and carries out beta-casein degradation in an ATP-independent  manner. EGY1 protein accumulation varies between tissue types, being most  prominent in leaf and stem tissues, and is responsive to light and ethylene.  EGY1-GFP hybrid proteins are localized in the chloroplast. egy1 mutant  chloroplasts had reduced granal thylakoids and poorly developed lamellae  networks. Furthermore, the accumulation of chlorophyll a/b binding proteins of  the light-harvesting complexes I and II (Lhca and Lhcb) are significantly  decreased in three separate loss-of-function egy1 mutants. Taken together, these  results suggest that EGY1 metalloprotease is required for chloroplast development  and, hence, a defective EGY1 gene has pleiotropic effects both on chloroplast  development and on ethylene-dependent gravitropism of light-grown hypocotyls.', '2005 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02308.x', 'Li']
