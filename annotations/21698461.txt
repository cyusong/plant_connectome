['21698461', 'The majority of phosphorus (P) in seeds is found in phytic acid (InsP(6)) which  accumulates as the mixed salt phytate. InsP(6) is generally considered to be an  anti-nutrient and the development of low phytic acid (lpa) seed crops is of  significant interest. We have employed a reverse genetics approach to examine the  impact of disrupting genes involved in inositol phosphate metabolism on  Arabidopsis seed InsP(6) levels. Our analysis revealed that knockout mutations in  three genes (AtITPK1, AtITPK4, and AtMIK/At5g58730) reduced seed InsP(6) in  addition to knockouts of four previously reported genes (AtIPK1, AtIPK2beta, AtMRP5,  and At5g60760). Seeds of these lpa mutants also exhibited reduced germination  under various stress conditions. The greatest reduction in InsP(6) (>70%) was  observed in atmrp5 seeds which were also among the least sensitive to the  stresses examined. Expression analysis of the lpa genes revealed three distinct  patterns in developing siliques consistent with their presumed roles. Disruption  of each lpa gene resulted in changes in the expression in some of the other lpa  genes indicating that transcription of lpa genes is modulated by other  constituents of InsP(6) metabolism. While all the lpa genes represent possible  targets for genetic engineering of low phytate seed crops, mutations in AtMRP5,  AtMIK, and At5g60760 may be most successful for conventional approaches such as  mutation breeding.', '2011 Aug', 'Mol Genet Genomics', '10.1007/s00438-011-0631-2', 'Tai']
