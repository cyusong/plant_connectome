Perception of vegetation proximity or plant shade informs of potential competition for resources by the neighboring vegetation. As vegetation proximity impacts on both light quantity and quality, perception of this cue by plant photoreceptors reprograms development to result in responses that allow plants to compete with the neighboring vegetation. Developmental reprogramming involves massive and rapid changes in gene expression, with the concerted action of photoreceptors and downstream transcription factors. Changes in gene expression can be modulated by epigenetic processes that alter chromatin compaction, influencing the accessibility and binding of transcription factors to regulatory elements in the DNA. However, little is known about the epigenetic regulation of plant responses to the proximity of other plants. In this manuscript, we review what is known about plant shade effects on chromatin changes at the cytological level, that is, changes in nuclear morphology and high order chromatin density. We address which are the specific histone post-transcriptional modifications that have been associated with changes in shade-regulated gene expression, such as histone acetylation and histone methylation. Furthermore, we explore the possible mechanisms that integrate shade signaling components and chromatin remodelers to settle epigenetic marks at specific loci. This review aims to be a starting point to understand how a specific environmental cue, plant shade, integrates with chromatin dynamics to implement the proper acclimation responses.
