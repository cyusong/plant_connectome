Although leaves are considered the main site for photosynthesis, other green nonfoliar tissues can carry out considerable amounts of photosynthetic carbon assimilation. With photosynthesis, a potential target for improving crop productivity, physiology and contribution of nonfoliar tissues to overall plant carbon acquisition is gaining increasing attention. This review will provide an overview of nonfoliar photosynthesis, the role of stomata in these tissues and methodologies for quantification and the contribution to overall carbon gain.

Gene: !affects! Photosynthesis 
Stomata: !regulate! Nonfoliar photosynthesis 
Methodologies: !quantify! Contribution to carbon gain
