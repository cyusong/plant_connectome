Physiological studies on aging in perennials are mainly focused either on the primary metabolism or the hormonal regulation of the process. However, to our knowledge, the involvement of the secondary metabolism in this process has not yet been explored. Cistus clusii, a Mediterranean sclerophyllous evergreen bush, shows considerable amounts of flavan-3-ols in leaves. In the present study, we aimed at determining the impact of environmental conditions and plant aging in the flavan-3-ol content in C. clusii plants grown in field conditions, which included summer drought and recovery periods. Six-year-old plants suffered more from photo-oxidative stress, especially during excess light periods, and showed lower maximum photosynthetic rates than 1-year-old plants. C. clusii leaves accumulated (-)-epigallocatechin gallate in early summer, in a strong positive correlation with both the photon flux density and the photoperiod, but not with the plant water status. Moreover, C. clusii plants accumulated proanthocyanidins (polymeric flavan-3-ols) in leaves during summer. Older plants showed higher levels of proanthocyanidins and (-)-epicatechin, but only during late spring and summer. From the result of the present study, we conclude that excess light enhances flavan-3-ol content in C. clusii, a process enhanced as plants age due to increased excess light stress.
