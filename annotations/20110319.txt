['20110319', 'The establishment of the primary meristems through proliferation after  germination is essential for plant post-embryonic development. Cytokinins have  long been considered a key regulator of plant cell division. Here we show that  cytokinins are essential for early seedling development of Arabidopsis. Loss of  cytokinin perception leads to a complete failure of meristem establishment and  growth arrest after germination. We also present evidence that cytokinin  signaling is involved in activation of the homeobox gene STIMPY (STIP or WOX9)  expression in meristematic tissues, which is essential for maintaining the  meristematic fate. Cytokinin-independent STIP expression is able to partially  compensate for the shoot apical meristem growth defects in mutants that cannot  sense cytokinin. These findings identify a new branch of the cytokinin signaling  network, linking cytokinin to the process of meristem and seedling establishment.', '2010 Feb', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.041426', 'Wu']
