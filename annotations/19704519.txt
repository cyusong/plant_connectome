Environmental and developmental signals can elicit differential activation of membrane proton (H(+)) fluxes as one of the primary responses of plant and fungal cells. In recent work,1 we could determine that during the presymbiotic growth of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi specific domains of H(+) flux are activated by clover root factors, namely host root exudates or whole root system. Consequently, activation on hyphal growth and branching were observed and the role of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase was investigated. The specific inhibitors differentially abolished most of hyphal H(+) effluxes and fungal growth. As this enzyme can act in signal transduction pathways, we believe that spatial and temporal oscillations of the hyphal H(+) fluxes could represent a pH signature for both early events of the AM symbiosis and fungal ontogeny.
