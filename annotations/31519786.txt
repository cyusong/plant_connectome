Hybrid rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) has been cultivated commercially for 42 years in China. However, poor grain filling still limits the development of hybrid <i>japonica</i> rice. We report here the map-based cloning and characterization of the <i>GRAIN-FILLING RATE1</i> (<i>GFR1</i>) gene present at a major-effect quantitative trait locus. We elucidated and confirmed the function of <i>GFR1</i> via genetic complementation experiments and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing in combination with genetic and molecular biological analyses. In addition, we conducted haplotype association analysis to mine the elite alleles of <i>GFR1</i> among 117 rice accessions. We observed that <i>GFR1</i> was constitutively expressed and encoded a membrane-localized protein. The allele of the rice accession Ludao (<i>GFR1</i> <sup>Ludao</sup>) improved the grain-filling rate of rice by increasing Rubisco initial activity in the Calvin cycle. Moreover, the increased expression of the cell wall invertase gene <i>OsCIN1</i> in the near isogenic line NIL-<i>GFR1</i> <sup>Ludao</sup> promoted the unloading of Suc during the rice grain-filling stage. A yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that the Rubisco small subunit interacts with GFR1, possibly in the regulation of the rice grain-filling rate. Evaluation of the grain-filling rate and grain yield of F1 plants harboring <i>GFR1</i> <sup>Ludao</sup> and the alleles of 20 hybrids widely cultivated commercially confirmed that favorable alleles of <i>GFR1</i> can be used to further improve the grain-filling rate of hybrid <i>japonica</i> rice.
