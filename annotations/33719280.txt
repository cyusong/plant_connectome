Leaf size is a crucial component of sesame (<i>Sesamum indicum</i> L.) plant architecture and further influences yield potential. Despite that it is well known that leaf size traits are quantitative traits controlled by large numbers of genes, quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes for sesame leaf size remain poorly understood. In the present study, we combined the QTL-seq approach and SSR marker mapping to identify the candidate genomic regions harboring QTL controlling leaf size traits in an RIL population derived from a cross between sesame varieties Zhongzhi No. 13 (with big leaves) and ZZM2289 (with small leaves). The QTL mapping revealed 56 QTL with phenotypic variation explained (PVE) from 1.87 to 27.50% for the length and width of leaves at the 1/3 and 1/2 positions of plant height. <i>qLS15-1</i>, a major and environmentally stable pleiotropic locus for both leaf length and width explaining 5.81 to 27.50% phenotypic variation, was located on LG15 within a 408-Kb physical genomic region flanked by the markers ZMM6185 and ZMM6206. In this region, a combination of transcriptome analysis with gene annotations revealed three candidate genes <i>SIN_1004875</i>, <i>SIN_1004882</i>, and <i>SIN_1004883</i> associated with leaf growth and development in sesame. These findings provided insight into the genetic characteristics and variability for sesame leaf and set up the foundation for future genomic studies on sesame leaves and will serve as gene resources for improvement of sesame plant architecture.
