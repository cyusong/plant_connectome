The molecular and physiological mechanisms of glycinebetaine stabilizing photosystem II complex under abiotic stresses are discussed, helping to address food shortage problems threatening the survival of growing population. In the backdrop of climate change, the frequency, dimensions and duration of extreme events have increased sharply, which may have unintended consequences for agricultural. The acclimation of plants to a constantly changing environment involves the accumulation of compatible solutes. Various compatible solutes enable plants to tolerate abiotic stresses, and glycinebetaine (GB) is one of the most-studied. The biosynthesis and accumulation of GB appear in numerous plant species, especially under environmental stresses. The exogenous application of GB and GB-accumulating transgenic plants have been proven to further promote plant development under stresses. Early research on GB focused on the maintenance of osmotic potential in plants. Subsequent experimental evidence demonstrated that it also protects proteins including the photosystem II complex (PSII) from denaturation and deactivation. As reviewed here, multiple experimental evidences have indicated considerable progress in the roles of GB in stabilizing PSII under abiotic stresses. Based on these advances, we've concluded two effects of GB on PSII: (1) it stabilizes the structure of PSII by protecting extrinsic proteins from dissociation or by promoting protein synthesize; (2) it enhances the oxygen-evolving activity of PSII or promotes the repair of the photosynthetic damage of PSII.
