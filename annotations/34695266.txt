Drought stress constitutes one of the major constraints to agriculture all over the world, and its devastating effect is only expected to increase in the following years due to climate change. Concurrently, the increasing food demand in a steadily growing population requires a proportional increase in yield and crop production. In the past, research aimed to increase plant resilience to severe drought stress. However, this often resulted in stunted growth and reduced yield under favorable conditions or moderate drought. Nowadays, drought tolerance research aims to maintain plant growth and yield under drought conditions. Overall, recently deployed strategies to engineer drought tolerance in the lab can be classified into a 'growth-centered' strategy, which focuses on keeping growth unaffected by the drought stress, and a 'drought resilience without growth penalty' strategy, in which the main aim is still to boost drought resilience, while limiting the side effects on plant growth. In this review, we put the scope on these two strategies and some molecular players that were successfully engineered to generate drought-tolerant plants: abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, ethylene, ROS scavenging genes, strigolactones, and aquaporins. We discuss how these pathways participate in growth and stress response regulation under drought. Finally, we present an overview of the current insights and future perspectives in the development of new strategies to improve drought tolerance in the field.
