Root-mediated CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, O<sub>2</sub> release and their effects on O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> dynamics in the rhizosphere of Lobelia dortmanna were investigated. Novel planar optode technology, imaging CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> distribution around single roots, provided insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of gas exchange between roots, sediment and microbial community. In light, O<sub>2</sub> release and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake were pronounced, resulting in a distinct oxygenated zone (radius: c. 3 mm) and a CO<sub>2</sub> -depleted zone (radius: c. 2 mm) around roots. Simultaneously, however, microbial CO<sub>2</sub> production was stimulated within a larger zone around the roots (radius: c. 10 mm). This gave rise to a distinct pattern with a CO<sub>2</sub> minimum at the root surface and a CO<sub>2</sub> maximum c. 2 mm away from the root. In darkness, CO<sub>2</sub> uptake ceased, and the CO<sub>2</sub> -depleted zone disappeared within 2 h. By contrast, the oxygenated root zone remained even after 8 h, but diminished markedly over time. A tight coupling between photosynthetic processes and the spatiotemporal dynamics of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> in the rhizosphere of Lobelia was demonstrated, and we suggest that O<sub>2</sub> -induced stimulation of the microbial community in the sediment increases the supply of inorganic carbon for photosynthesis by building up a CO<sub>2</sub> reservoir in the rhizosphere.
