['9661674', 'Sulfite reductase (SIR) represents a key enzyme in sulfate assimilation in higher  plants. The genomic DNA sequence of the sir gene from Arabidopsis thaliana  including regulatory and structural regions was isolated and characterized. The  sequence of a 6 kb fragment encoding SIR revealed a coding region of 2891  basepairs (bp) that consists of eight exons separated by seven introns between 83  and 139 bp in length. The transcription start point was determined 272 bp  upstream of the translation start site. Southern analysis indicates a single  locus for the sir gene that gives rise to a 2.4 (kb) mRNA in leaves and in roots.  The promoter region was verified by functional expression of the gusA reporter  gene in transgenic A. thaliana plants and was shown to provide correct expression  in root and leaf.', '1998 May 28', 'Gene', '10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00155-3', 'Hell']
