YABBY genes play important roles in the growth and polar establishment of lateral organs such as leaves and floral organs in angiosperms. However, the functions of YABBY homologous genes are largely unknown in soybean. In this study, we identified GmFILa encoding a YABBY transcription factor belonging to FIL subfamily. In situ mRNA hybridization analysis indicated that GmFILa had specific expression patterns in leaf as well as in flower bud primordia. Ectopic expression of GmFILa in Arabidopsis thaliana altered the partial abaxialization of the adaxial epidermises of leaves. Besides, GmFILa transgenic plants also exhibited longer flowering period and inhibition of shoot apical meristem (SAM) development compared to the wild type plants. Digital expression data and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that the expression of GmFILa was induced by biotic and abiotic stresses and hormone treatments. Transcriptome analysis suggested that overexpressing GmFILa yielded 82 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Arabidopsis leaves, which can be classified into transcription factors, transporters, and genes involved in growth and development, metabolism, signal transduction, redox reaction and stress response. These results not only demonstrate the roles of GmFILa involved in leaf adaxial-abaxial polarity in Arabidopsis, but also help to reveal the molecular regulatory mechanism of GmFILa based on the transcriptomic data.
