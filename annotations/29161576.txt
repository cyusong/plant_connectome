Olive (Olea europaea L.) is an economically important crop for the Mediterranean basin, where prolonged drought and soil salinization may occur. This plant has developed a series of mechanisms to tolerate and grow under these adverse conditions. By using an integrated approach, we described in Chétoui olive cultivar the changes in plant growth, oxidative damage and osmolyte accumulation in leaves, in combination with corresponding changes in physiological parameters and proteome. Our results showed, under both stress conditions, a greater growth reduction of the aboveground plant organs than of the underground counterparts. This was associated with a reduction of all photosynthetic parameters, the integrity of photosystem II and leaf nitrogen content, and corresponding representation of photosynthetic apparatus proteins, Calvin-Benson cycle and nitrogen metabolism. The most significant changes were observed under the salinity stress condition. Oxidative stress was also observed, in particular, lipid peroxidation, which could be tentatively balanced by a concomitant photoprotective/antioxidative increase of carotenoid levels. At the same time, various compensative mechanisms to cope with nitrogen source demands and to control plant cell osmolarity were also shown by olive plants under these stresses. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Chétoui variety is moderately sensitive to both drought and salt stress, although it has greater ability to tolerate water depletion.
