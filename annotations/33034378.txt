Plants that grow in high density communities activate shade avoidance responses to consolidate light capture by individuals. Although this is an evolutionary successful strategy, it may not enhance performance of the community as a whole. Resources are invested in shade responses at the expense of other organs and light penetration through the canopy is increased, allowing invading competitors to grow better. Here we investigate if suppression of shade avoidance responses would enhance group performance of a monoculture community that is invaded by a competitor. Using different Arabidopsis genotypes, we show that suppression of shade-induced upward leaf movement in the pif7 mutant increases the pif7 communal performance against invaders as compared to a wild-type canopy. The invaders were more severely suppressed and the community grew larger as compared to wild type. Using computational modelling, we show that leaf angle variations indeed strongly affect light penetration and growth of competitors that invade the canopy. Our data thus show that modifying specific shade avoidance aspects can improve plant community performance. These insights may help to suppress weeds in crop stands.
