Two large protein-cofactor complexes, photosystem I and photosystem II, are the central components of photosynthesis in the thylakoid membranes. Here, we report the 2.37-Å structure of a tetrameric photosystem I complex from a heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. Four photosystem I monomers, organized in a dimer of dimer, form two distinct interfaces that are largely mediated by specifically orientated polar lipids, such as sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol. The structure depicts a more closely connected network of chlorophylls across monomer interfaces than those seen in trimeric PSI from thermophilic cyanobacteria, possibly allowing a more efficient energy transfer between monomers. Our physiological data also revealed a functional link of photosystem I oligomerization to cyclic electron flow and thylakoid membrane organization.
