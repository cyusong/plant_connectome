Proteolysis-related genes have diverse functions across taxa and have long been considered as key players for intracellular protein turnover. Growing evidence indicates the biological significance of peptidases in degradation, maturation and modulation of bioactive peptides/proteins. By screening T-DNA tagged lines and functional analysis approaches we unraveled the Arabidopsis leucine aminopeptidase (AtLAP2) function in amino acid turnover. Transcriptomics and metabolomics profiling data suggested involvement of AtLAP2 in specific metabolic pathways. Loss-of-function of AtLAP2 resulted in early-leaf senescent and stress-sensitive phenotypes. Our work indicates an important in planta role for AtLAP2 contributing to a further understanding of the proteases having several implications in higher plants.
