The transcription machinery of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes has been investigated extensively in human cell-free systems, but its physiological function in vivo has not been addressed. This paper demonstrates the physiological role of an activator of snRNA transcription using a temperature-sensitive mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, srd2. Phenotypic characteristics of the srd2 mutant suggest that the SRD2 gene participates in the control of competence in cell proliferation. The SRD2 gene encodes a nuclear protein that shares sequence similarity with the human SNAP50 protein, which is a subunit of SNAPc and is required for snRNA transcription in vitro. Our results, obtained from analysis of snRNA expression in the srd2 mutant, indicate that the SRD2 protein functions in the upregulation of transcription of snRNA genes, the promoters of which contain the upstream sequence element, to elevate cell proliferation competence.
