High salinity, an adverse environmental factor affecting about 20% of irrigated arable land worldwide, inhibits plant growth and development by causing oxidative stress, damaging cellular components, and disturbing global metabolism. However, whether and how reactive oxygen species disturb the metabolism of salt-stressed plants remain elusive. Here, we report that salt-induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) inhibits the activity of plastid triose phosphate isomerase (pdTPI) to promote methylglyoxal (MG) accumulation and stimulates the sulfenylation of pdTPI at cysteine 74. We also show that MG is a key factor limiting plant growth, as a decrease in MG levels completely rescued the stunted growth and repressed salt stress tolerance of the pdtpi mutant. Furthermore, targeting CATALASE 2 (CAT2) into chloroplasts to prevent salt-induced overaccumulation of H2O2 conferred salt stress tolerance, revealing a role for chloroplastic H2O2 in salt-caused plant damage. In addition, we demonstrate that the H2O2-mediated accumulation of MG in turn induces H2O2 production, thus forming a regulatory loop that further inhibits pdTPI activity in salt-stressed plants. Our findings therefore illustrate how salt stress induces MG production to inhibit plant growth.
