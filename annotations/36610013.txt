Asymmetric cell division (ACD) is a fundamental process that generates new cell types during development in eukaryotic species. In plant development, post-embryonic organogenesis driven by ACD is universal and more important than in animals, in which organ pattern is preset during embryogenesis. Thus, plant development provides a powerful system to study molecular mechanisms underlying ACD. During the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of the key components and mechanisms involved in this important process in plants. Here, we present an overview of how ACD is determined and regulated in multiple biological processes in plant development and compare their conservation and specificity among different model cell systems. We also summarize the molecular roles and mechanisms of the phytohormones in the regulation of plant ACD. Finally, we conclude with the overarching paradigms and principles that govern plant ACD and consider how new technologies can be exploited to fill the knowledge gaps and make new advances in the field.
