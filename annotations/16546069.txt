Complex machinery has evolved to recognise and import nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria. Recent work now shows that the plant Tom20 mitochondrial protein import receptor has a similar tertiary structure to animal Tom20, although the proteins are evolutionarily distinct, representing an elegant example of convergent evolution.

Tom20: !evolutionarily distinct! Plant/Animal
Tom20: !similar tertiary structure! Plant/Animal
Tom20: !recognise and import! Nuclear-encoded proteins
Tom20: !import receptor! Mitochondria
