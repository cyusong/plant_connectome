['26169197', 'Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenases oxidize betaine aldehyde to glycine betaine in  species that accumulate glycine betaine as a compatible solute under stress  conditions. In contrast, the physiological function of betaine aldehyde  dehydrogenase genes is at present unclear in species that do not accumulate  glycine betaine, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. To address this question, we  overexpressed the Arabidopsis ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 genes, which were identified  to code for betaine aldehyde dehydrogenases, in wild-type A. thaliana. We  analysed changes in metabolite contents of transgenic plants in comparison with  the wild type. Using exogenous or endogenous choline, our results indicated that  ALDH10A8 and ALDH10A9 are involved in the synthesis of glycine betaine in  Arabidopsis. Choline availability seems to be a factor limiting glycine betaine  synthesis. Moreover, the contents of diverse metabolites including sugars  (glucose and fructose) and amino acids were altered in fully developed transgenic  plants compared with the wild type. The plant metabolic response to salt and the  salt stress tolerance were impaired only in young transgenic plants, which  exhibited a delayed growth of the seedlings early after germination. Our results  suggest that a balanced expression of the betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase genes is  important for early growth of A. thaliana seedlings and for salt stress  mitigation in young seedlings.', '2015 Sep', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcv105', 'Bartels']
