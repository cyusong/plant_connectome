The recessive Arabidopsis thalianafumonisin B1-resistant (fbr6) mutant was identified by its ability to survive in the presence of a programmed cell death (PCD)-inducing fungal toxin FB1. The fbr6 mutant also displays altered plant architecture in the absence of FB1, most notably elongated petioles and enhanced leaf margin serration. These phenotypes are a result of a T-DNA insertion in the SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein (SBP) domain gene, AtSPL14. AtSPL14 encodes a plant-specific protein with features characteristic of a transcriptional regulator, including a nuclear localization signal sequence, a plant-specific DNA binding domain (the SBP box), and a protein interaction motif (ankyrin repeats). A transiently expressed fusion of the AtSPL14 protein to green fluorescent protein is directed to the plant nucleus. DNA sequences immediately upstream of the translation start site direct expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene primarily in the vascular tissues, consistent with the phenotypes of the fbr6 mutant. AtSPL14 activates transcription in yeast, with a transactivation domain residing within the N-terminal region of the protein. Recombinant AtSPL14 protein binds A. thaliana genomic DNA in vitro in the absence of other proteins. These results indicate that FBR6/SPL14 functions as a transcriptional regulator that plays a role not only in sensitivity to FB1, but also in the development of normal plant architecture.
