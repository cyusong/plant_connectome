Peptide aptamers are artificial short peptides that potentially interfere with the biological roles of their target proteins; however, this technology has not yet been applied to plant functional genomics. MAGO and Y14, the two core subunits of the exon junction complex (EJC), form obligate heterodimers in eukaryotes. In Oryza sativa L. (rice), each of the two genes has two homologs, designated OsMAGO1 and OsMAGO2, and OsY14a and OsY14b, respectively. Here, we characterized a 16-amino acida peptide aptamer (PAP) for the rice MAGO proteins. PAP and rice Y14 bound competitively to rice MAGO proteins. Specifically targeting the MAGO proteins by expressing the aptamer in transgenic rice plants did not affect the endogenous synthesis and accumulation of MAGO proteins; however, the phenotypic variations observed in multiple organs phenocopied those of transgenic rice plants harboring RNA interference (RNAi) constructs in which the accumulation of MAGO and/or OsY14a transcripts and MAGO proteins was downregulated severely. Morphologically, the aptamer transgenic plants were short with abnormally developed flowers, and the stamens exhibited reduced degradation and absorption of both the endothecium and tapetum, thus confirming that EJC core heterodimers play essential roles in rice development, growth and reproduction. This study reveals that as a complementary approach of RNAi, peptide aptamers are powerful tools for interfering with the function of proteins in higher plants.
