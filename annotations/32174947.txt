Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating wheat disease worldwide. To decipher the genetic architecture of FHB resistance in Chinese germplasm, a Wheat Association Panel for Scab Research (WAPS) consisting of 240 leading Chinese wheat cultivars and elite lines was genotyped using the 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. The FHB response was evaluated in the field nurseries in Wuhan in Hubei Province over four consecutive years from 2014 to 2017. Five quantitative trait loci (QTL) were consistently identified on chromosome arms 1AS, 2DL, 5AS, 5AL, and 7DS using a mixed linear model (MLM), explaining 5.6, 10.3, 5.7, 5.4, and 5.6% of phenotypic variation, respectively. The QTL on 5AS, 5AL, and 7DS QTL are probably novel. The allelic frequency analysis indicated that cultivars from the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Valleys harbored more favorable alleles and were therefore more resistant than those from other regions. To facilitate in-house germplasm screening and marker-assisted selection (MAS), SNP-derived PCR markers were developed for the QTL regions on 1AS, 5AS, and 5AL QTL. In addition to the above five QTL, the WAPS population had a very low frequency of <i>Fhb1</i>, confirming that the gene is not widely used in Chinese wheat breeding programs. The resistant lines and molecular markers developed in this study are resources and information for enhancing FHB resistance in breeding populations by marker-assisted recurrent selection and gene stacking.
