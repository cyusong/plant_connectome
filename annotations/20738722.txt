The (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) fingerprints of fractionated non-polar and polar extracts (control substance for plant drug [CSPD] A and B) from the roots of 12 specimens of Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz.) Schischk were achieved with Fourier Transform (FT)-NMR spectrometer and assigned by comparison to each other and to the (1)H NMR spectra of the isolated individual compounds. These fingerprints were found to be uniform in terms of the specificity for the implication of all 12 specimens being systematically of the same origin. The uniformity was further affirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which also revealed exactly identical specificity for the identified S. divaricata species with the (1)H NMR appearances of corresponding CSPD on the part of the composition of characteristic constituents when comparing to corresponding individual compounds. This investigation unambiguously shows that the specific signals from the chemotaxonomically significant compounds of chromones and coumarins in S. divaricata are exhibited distinctively in the composite features of both (1)H NMR fingerprints and HPLC profiles. The (1)H NMR and HPLC profiles established can successfully be used as reference for the authentication of the origin of S. divaricata species as well as for chemotaxonomic studies.
