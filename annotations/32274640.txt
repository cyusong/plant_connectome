In this manuscript, we disclosed the influence of light on the accumulation of storage reserves in B. napus embryos.1.Light induced the gene expression in the developing embryos of B. napus.2.Light promoted the starch synthesis in chloroplasts of B. napus embryos.3.Light enhanced the metabolic activity of storage reserve synthesis in B. napus embryos. Light influences the accumulation of storage reserves in embryos, but the molecular mechanism was not fully understood. Here, we monitored the effects of light on reserve biosynthesis in Brassica napus by comparing embryos from siliques grown in normal light conditions to those that were shaded or masked (i.e., darkened completely). Masked embryos developed more slowly, weighed less, and contained fewer proteins and lipids than control embryos. They also had fewer and smaller oil bodies than control embryos and lacked chloroplasts, where starch grains are usually synthesized. The levels of most amino acids, carbohydrates, and fatty acids were higher in masked embryos than in control or shaded embryos, whereas the levels of these metabolites in the masked endosperms were lower than those in control and shaded endosperm. Transcriptome analysis indicated that genes involved in photosynthesis (42 genes), amino acid biosynthesis (51 genes), lipid metabolism (61 genes), and sugar transport (13 genes) were significantly repressed in masked embryos. Our results suggest that light contributes to reserve accumulation in embryos by inducing the expression of metabolic genes, thereby enhancing the biosynthesis of storage reserves.
