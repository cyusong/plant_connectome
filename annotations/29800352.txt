Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments in plants. They confer both economic and healthy profits for humans. To gain a deeper insight into the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in octoploid strawberry (Fragariaï¿½ananassa; Fa), a widely consumed economically important fruit, we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis of red- and white-fleshed strawberry cultivars in two ripening stages. In total, 365,455 non-redundant transcripts were assembled from the RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data. Of this collection, 377 were annotated as putative anthocyanin-related transcripts. Differential expression analysis revealed that 57 anthocyanin biosynthesis transcripts were down-regulated, and 89 transcription factors (TFs) were either down- or up-regulated under anthocyanin deficiency. Additionally, amongst the 50,601 putative long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) identified here, 68 lncRNAs were differentially expressed and co-expressed with differentially expressed anthocyanin-related mRNAs; 2,070 co-expressing lncRNA-mRNA pairs were generated. Expression profile analysis revealed that it was the limited expression of FaF3'H (flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase) that blocked the cyanidin 3-glucoside accumulation in the two investigated strawberry cultivars. This was further supported by a transient overexpression experiment with FaMYB10. The down-regulated lncRNAs might participate in anthocyanin regulation by acting as targets for microRNAs (miRNAs). The level of competitive intensity in miRNA and lncRNA for the same mRNA targets was probably lower in the white-fleshed strawberries, which can release the repression effect of the mRNAs in red-fleshed strawberry as a result. This study for the first time presents lncRNAs related to anthocyanins in strawberries, provides new insights into the anthocyanin regulatory network and also lays the foundation for identifying new anthocyanin regulators in strawberry.
