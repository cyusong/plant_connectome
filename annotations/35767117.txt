This minireview details the impact of iron-phosphate and zinc-phosphate interactions in plants and provides perspectives for further areas of research regarding nutrient homeostasis. Iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) are among the most important micronutrients for plant growth and have numerous implications for human health and agriculture. While plants have developed efficient uptake and transport mechanisms for Fe and Zn, emerging research has shown that the availability of other nutrients in the environment influences the homeostasis of Fe and Zn within plants. In this minireview, we present the current knowledge regarding homeostatic interactions of Fe and Zn with the macronutrient phosphorous (P) and the resulting physiological responses to combined deficiencies of these nutrients. Fe and P interactions have been shown to influence root development, photosynthesis, and biological processes aiding Fe uptake. Zn and P interactions also influence root growth, and coordination of Zn-dependent transcriptional regulation contributes to phosphate (Pi) transport in the plant. Understanding homeostatic interactions among these different nutrients is of critical importance to obtain a more complete understanding of plant nutrition in complex soil environments.
