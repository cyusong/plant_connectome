Leaf and panicle are important nutrient and yield organs in rice, respectively. Although several genes controlling lesion mimic leaf and panicle abortion have been identified, a few studies have reported the involvement of a single gene in the production of both the traits. In this study, we characterized a panicle abortion mutant, <i>lesion mimic leaf and panicle apical abortion</i> (<i>lmpa</i>), which exhibits lesions on the leaf and causes degeneration of apical spikelets. Molecular cloning revealed that <i>LMPA</i> encodes a proton pump ATPase protein that is localized in the plasma membrane and is highly expressed in leaves and panicles. The analysis of promoter activity showed that the insertion of a fragment in the promoter of <i>lmpa</i> caused a decrease in the transcription level. Cellular and histochemistry analysis indicated that the ROS accumulated and cell death occurred in lmpa. Moreover, physiological experiments revealed that <i>lmpa</i> was more sensitive to high temperatures and salt stress conditions. These results provide a better understanding of the role of <i>LMPA</i> in panicle development and lesion mimic formation by regulating ROS homeostasis.
