Because they are tethered in space, plants have to make the most of their local growth environment. In order to grow in an ever-changing environment, plants constantly remodel their shapes. This adaptive attribute requires the orchestration of complex environmental signals at the cellular and organismal levels. A battery of small molecules, classically known as phytohormones, allows plants to change their body plan by using highly integrated signaling networks and transcriptional cascades. Amongst these hormones, brassinosteroids (BRs), the polyhydroxylated steroid of plants, influence plant responsiveness to the local environment and exquisitely promote, or interfere with, many aspects of plant development. The molecular circuits that wire steroid signals at the cell surface to the promoters of thousands of genes in the nucleus have been defined in the past decade. This review recapitulates how the transduction of BR signals impacts the temporally unfolding programs of plant growth. First, we summarize the paradigmatic BR signaling pathway acting primarily in cellular expansion. Secondly, we describe the current wiring diagram and the temporal dynamics of the BR signal transduction network. And finally we provide an overview of how key players in BR signaling act as molecular gates to transduce BR signals onto other signaling pathways.
