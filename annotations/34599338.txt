Immune responses are triggered when pattern recognition receptors recognize microbial molecular patterns. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE1 (BIK1) acts as a signaling hub of plant immunity. BIK1 homeostasis is maintained by a regulatory module in which CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE28 (CPK28) regulates BIK1 turnover via the activities of two E3 ligases. Immune-induced alternative splicing of CPK28 attenuates CPK28 function. However, it remained unknown whether CPK28 is under proteasomal control. Here, we demonstrate that CPK28 undergoes ubiquitination and 26S proteasome-mediated degradation, which is enhanced by flagellin treatment. Two closely related ubiquitin ligases, ARABIDOPSIS TÓXICOS EN LEVADURA31 (ATL31) and ATL6, specifically interact with CPK28 at the plasma membrane; this association is enhanced by flagellin elicitation. ATL31/6 directly ubiquitinate CPK28, resulting in its proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, ATL31/6 promotes the stability of BIK1 by mediating CPK28 degradation. Consequently, ATL31/6 positively regulate BIK1-mediated immunity. Our findings reveal another mechanism for attenuating CPK28 function to maintain BIK1 homeostasis and enhance immune responses.
