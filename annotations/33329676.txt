The plant hormone cytokinin, existing in several molecular forms, is perceived by membrane-localized histidine kinases. The signal is transduced to transcription factors of the type-B response regulator family localized in the nucleus by a multi-step histidine-aspartate phosphorelay network employing histidine phosphotransmitters as shuttle proteins across the nuclear envelope. The type-B response regulators activate a number of primary response genes, some of which trigger in turn further signaling events and the expression of secondary response genes. Most genes activated in both rounds of transcription were identified with high confidence using different transcriptomic toolkits and meta analyses of multiple individual published datasets. In this review, we attempt to summarize the existing knowledge about the primary and secondary cytokinin response genes in order to try connecting gene expression with the multitude of effects that cytokinin exerts within the plant body and throughout the lifespan of a plant.
