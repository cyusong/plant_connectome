Two independent studies converge on similar causes for olfactory loss-of-function mutants in evolutionary transitions to scentless flowers. This molecular déjà vu may reflect selection to minimize negative pleiotropy in a complex biosynthetic pathway.

Gene: !affects! Olfactory loss-of-function
Gene: !minimizes! Negative pleiotropy
