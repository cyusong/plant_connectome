Phosphorus (P) is one of the essential macronutrients, whose deficiency limits the growth and development of plants. In this study, we investigated the possible role of <i>GmWRKY46</i> in the phosphate (Pi) starvation stress tolerance of soybean. GmWRKY46 belonged to the group III subfamily of the WRKY transcription factor family, which was localized in the nucleus and had transcriptional activator activity. <i>GmWRKY46</i> could be strongly induced by Pi starvation, especially in soybean roots. Overexpression of <i>GmWRKY46</i> significantly enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation and lateral root development in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>. RNA-seq analysis showed that overexpression of <i>GmWRKY46</i> led to change in many genes related to energy metabolisms, stress responses, and plant hormone signal transduction in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Among these differential expression genes, we found that overexpression of <i>AtAED1</i> alone could enhance the tolerance of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> to Pi starvation. Y1H and ChIP-qPCR analyses showed that GmWRKY46 could directly bind to the W-box motif of the <i>AtAED1</i> promoter <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Furthermore, results from intact soybean composite plants with <i>GmWRKY46</i> overexpression showed that <i>GmWRKY46</i> was involved in hairy roots development and subsequently affected plant growth and Pi uptake. These results provide a basis for the molecular genetic breeding of soybean tolerant to Pi starvation.
