Understanding the effects of spaceflight on plant flowering regulation is important to setup a life support system for long-term human space exploration. However, the way in which plant flowering is affected by spaceflight remains unclear. Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the Chinese spacelab Tiangong-2, in which Arabidopsis wild-type and transgenic plants <i>pFT::GFP</i> germinated and grew as normally as their controls on the ground, but the floral initiation under the long-day condition in space was about 20 days later than their controls on the ground. Time-course series of digital images of <i>pFT::GFP</i> plants showed that the expression rhythm of <i>FT</i> in space did not change, but the peak appeared later in comparison with those of their controls on the ground. Whole-genome microarray analysis revealed that approximately 16% of Arabidopsis genes at the flowering stage changed their transcript levels under spaceflight conditions in comparison with their controls on the ground. The GO terms were enriched in DEGs with up-regulation of the response to temperature, wounding, and protein stabilization and down-regulation of the function in circadian rhythm, gibberellins, and mRNA processes. <i>FT</i> and <i>SOC1</i> could act as hubs to integrate spaceflight stress signals into the photoperiodic flowering pathway in Arabidopsis in space.
