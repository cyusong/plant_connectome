['16169964', 'Rad51 is a homolog of the bacterial RecA recombinase, and a key factor in  homologous recombination in eukaryotes. Rad51 paralogs have been identified from  yeast to vertebrates. Rad51 paralogs are thought to play an important role in the  assembly or stabilization of Rad51 that promotes homologous pairing and strand  exchange reactions. We previously characterized two RAD51 paralogous genes in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) named AtRAD51C and AtXRCC3, which are homologs  of human RAD51C and XRCC3, respectively, and described the interaction of their  products in a yeast two-hybrid system. Recent studies showed the involvement of  AtXrcc3 in DNA repair and functional role in meiosis. To determine the role of  RAD51C in meiotic and mitotic recombination in higher plants, we characterized a  T-DNA insertion mutant of AtRAD51C. Although the atrad51C mutant grew normally  during vegetative developmental stage, the mutant produced aborted siliques, and  their anthers did not contain mature pollen grains. Crossing of the mutant with  wild-type plants showed defective male and female gametogeneses as evidenced by  lack of seed production. Furthermore, meiosis was severely disturbed in the  mutant. The atrad51C mutant also showed increased sensitivity to  gamma-irradiation and cisplatin, which are known to induce double-strand DNA  breaks. The efficiency of homologous recombination in somatic cells in the mutant  was markedly reduced relative to that in wild-type plants.', '2005 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.065243', 'Toki']
