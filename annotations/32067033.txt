Many plants synchronize their life cycles in response to changing seasons and initiate flowering under favourable environmental conditions to ensure reproductive success. To confer a robust seasonal response, plants use diverse genetic programmes that integrate environmental and endogenous cues and converge on central floral regulatory hubs. Technological advances have allowed us to understand these complex processes more completely. Here, we review recent progress in our understanding of genetic and molecular mechanisms that control flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana.
