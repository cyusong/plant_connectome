['16081412', 'Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) regulates the level of the second messenger  diacylglycerol and produces phosphatidic acid (PA), another signaling molecule.  The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes seven putative diacylglycerol kinase  isozymes (named AtDGK1 to -7), structurally falling into three major clusters. So  far, enzymatic activity has not been reported for any plant Cluster II DGK. Here,  we demonstrate that a representative of this cluster, AtDGK7, is biochemically  active when expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli. AtDGK7,  encoded by gene locus At4g30340, contains 374 amino acids with an apparent  molecular mass of 41.2 kDa. AtDGK7 harbors an N-terminal catalytic domain, but in  contrast to various characterized DGKs (including AtDGK2), it lacks a  cysteine-rich domain at its N terminus, and, importantly, its C-terminal DGK  accessory domain is incomplete. Recombinant AtDGK7 expressed in E. coli exhibits  Michaelis-Menten type kinetics with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol as substrate. AtDGK7  activity was affected by pH, detergents, and the DGK inhibitor R59022. We  demonstrate that both AtDGK2 and AtDGK7 phosphorylate diacylglycerol molecular  species that are typically found in plants, indicating that both enzymes convert  physiologically relevant substrates. AtDGK7 is expressed throughout the  Arabidopsis plant, but expression is strongest in flowers and young seedlings.  Expression of AtDGK2 is transiently induced by wounding. R59022 at approximately  80 mum inhibits root elongation and lateral root formation and reduces plant  growth, indicating that DGKs play an important role in plant development.', '2005 Oct 14', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M506859200', 'Mueller-Roeber']
