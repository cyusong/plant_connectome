['29702752', 'Melatonin has been detected in plants in 1995; however, the function and  signaling pathway of this putative phytohormone are largely undetermined due to a  lack of knowledge about its receptor. Here, we discovered the first  phytomelatonin receptor (CAND2/PMTR1) in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that  melatonin governs the receptor-dependent stomatal closure. The application of  melatonin induced stomatal closure through the heterotrimeric G protein alpha  subunit-regulated H(2) O(2) and Ca(2+) signals. The Arabidopsis mutant lines  lacking AtCand2 that encodes a candidate G protein-coupled receptor were  insensitive to melatonin-induced stomatal closure. Accordingly, the  melatonin-induced H(2) O(2) production and Ca(2+) influx were completely  abolished in cand2. CAND2 is a membrane protein that interacts with GPA1 and the  expression of AtCand2 was tightly regulated by melatonin in various organs and  guard cells. CAND2 showed saturable and specific (125) I-melatonin binding, with  apparent K(d) (dissociation constant) of 0.73 +/- 0.10 nmol/L (r(2)  = .99),  demonstrating this protein is a phytomelatonin receptor (PMTR1). Our results  suggest that the phytomelatonin regulation of stomatal closure is dependent on  its receptor CAND2/PMTR1-mediated H(2) O(2) and Ca(2+) signaling transduction  cascade.', '2018 Sep', 'J Pineal Res', '10.1111/jpi.12500', 'ORCID:']
