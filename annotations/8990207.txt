['8990207', 'AtKCBP is a calcium-dependent calmodulin-binding protein from Arabidopsis that  contains a conserved kinesin microtubule motor domain. Calmodulin has been shown  previously to bind to heavy chains of the unconventional myosins, where it is  required for in vitro motility of brush border myosin I, but AtKCBP is the first  kinesin-related heavy chain reported to be capable of binding specifically to  calmodulin. Other kinesin proteins have been identified in Arabidopsis, but none  of these binds to calmodulin, and none has been demonstrated to be a microtubule  motor. We have tested bacterially expressed AtKCBP for the ability to bind  microtubules to a glass surface and induce gliding of microtubules across the  glass surface. We find that AtKCBP is a microtubule motor protein that moves on  microtubules toward the minus ends, with the opposite polarity as kinesin. In the  presence of calcium and calmodulin, AtKCBP no longer binds microtubules to the  coverslip surface. This contrasts strikingly with the requirement of calmodulin  for in vitro motility of brush border myosin I. Calmodulin could regulate AtKCBP  binding to microtubules in the cell by inhibiting the binding of the motor to  microtubules. The ability to bind to calmodulin provides an evolutionary link  between the kinesin and myosin motor proteins, but our results indicate that the  mechanisms of interaction and regulation of kinesin and myosin heavy chains by  calmodulin are likely to differ significantly.', '1997 Jan 7', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.94.1.322', 'Endow']
