['19293369', 'Glucosinolates are defensive secondary compounds that display large structural  diversity in Arabidopsis thaliana and related plants. Much attention has been  paid to variation in the biosynthesis of Met-derived aliphatic glucosinolates and  its ecological consequences, but little is known about the genes that cause  qualitative and quantitative differences in Trp-derived indole glucosinolates. We  use a combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) fine-mapping and  microarray-based transcript profiling to identify CYP81F2 (At5g57220), encoding a  cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, as the gene underlying Indole Glucosinolate  Modifier1 (IGM1), a metabolic QTL for the accumulation of two modified indole  glucosinolates, 4-hydroxy-indole-3-yl-methyl and 4-methoxy-indole-3-yl-methyl  glucosinolate. We verify CYP81F2 function with two SALK T-DNA insertion lines and  show that CYP81F2 catalyzes the conversion of indole-3-yl-methyl to  4-hydroxy-indole-3-yl-methyl glucosinolate. We further show that the IGM1 QTL is  largely caused by differences in CYP81F2 expression, which results from a  combination of cis- and trans-acting expression QTL different from known  regulators of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis. Finally, we elucidate a  potential function of CYP81F2 in plant-insect interactions and find that CYP81F2  contributes to defense against the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) but not to  resistance against herbivory by larvae from four lepidopteran species.', '2009 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.063115', 'Kroymann']
