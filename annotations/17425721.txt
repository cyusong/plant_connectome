['17425721', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana lysyl tRNA synthetase (AtKRS) structurally and  functionally resembles the well-characterized prokaryotic class IIb KRS,  including the propensity to aminoacylate tRNA(Lys) with suboptimal identity  elements, as well as non-cognate tRNAs. Transient expression of AtKRS in carrot  cells promotes aminoacylation of such tRNAs in vivo and translational recoding of  lysine at nonsense codons. Stable expression of AtKRS in Zea mays causes  translational recoding of lysine into zeins, significantly enriching the lysine  content of grain.', '2007 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03076.x', 'Folk']
