['22404109', 'It is now emerging that many proteins are regulated by a variety of covalent  modifications. Using microcystin-affinity chromatography we have purified  multiple protein phosphatases and their associated proteins from Arabidopsis  thaliana. One major protein purified was the histone deacetylase HDA14. We  demonstrate that HDA14 can deacetylate alpha-tubulin, associates with alpha/beta-tubulin and  is retained on GTP/taxol-stabilized microtubules, at least in part, by direct  association with the PP2A-A2 subunit. Like HDA14, the putative histone  acetyltransferase ELP3 was purified on microcystin-Sepharose and is also enriched  at microtubules, potentially functioning in opposition to HDA14 as the alpha-tubulin  acetylating enzyme. Consistent with the likelihood of it having many substrates  throughout the cell, we demonstrate that HDA14, ELP3 and the PP2A A-subunits A1,  A2 and A3 all reside in both the nucleus and cytosol of the cell. The association  of a histone deacetylase with PP2A suggests a direct link between protein  phosphorylation and acetylation.', '2012 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04984.x', 'Moorhead']
