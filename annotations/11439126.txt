['11439126', 'In Arabidopsis, the closely related APETALA1 (AP1) and CAULIFLOWER (CAL) MADS-box  genes share overlapping roles in promoting flower meristem identity. Later in  flower development, the AP1 gene is required for normal development of sepals and  petals. Studies of MADS-domain proteins in diverse species have shown that they  often function as heterodimers or in larger ternary complexes, suggesting that  additional proteins may interact with AP1 and CAL during flower development. To  identify proteins that may interact with AP1 and CAL, we used the yeast  two-hybrid assay. Among the five MADS-box genes identified in this screen, the  SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) gene was chosen for further study. Mutations in the SEP3 gene,  as well as SEP3 antisense plants that have a reduction in SEP3 RNA, display  phenotypes that closely resemble intermediate alleles of AP1. Furthermore, the  early flowering phenotype of plants constitutively expressing AP1 is  significantly enhanced by constitutive SEP3 expression. Taken together, these  studies suggest that SEP3 interacts with AP1 to promote normal flower  development.', '2001 May', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2001.2641042.x', 'Yanofsky']
