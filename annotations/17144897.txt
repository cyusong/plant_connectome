['17144897', 'CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its homolog p300 possess histone acetyltransferase  activity and function as key transcriptional co-activators in the regulation of  gene expression that controls differentiation and development in animals.  However, the role of CBP/p300-like genes in plants has not yet been elucidated.  Here, we show that Arabidopsis CBP/p300-like genes promote flowering by affecting  the expression of a major floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Although  animal CBP and p300 generally function as co-activators, Arabidopsis  CBP/p300-like proteins are required for the negative regulation of FLC. This  CBP/p300-mediated FLC repression may involve reversible protein acetylation  independent of histone modification within FLC chromatin.', '2007 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02939.x', 'Noh']
