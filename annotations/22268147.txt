['22268147', 'Drought is one of the most severe environmental stresses affecting plant growth  and limiting crop production. Although many genes involved in adaptation to  drought stress have been disclosed, the relevant molecular mechanisms are far  from understood. This study describes an Arabidopsis gene, ASPG1 (ASPARTIC  PROTEASE IN GUARD CELL 1), that may function in drought avoidance through  abscisic acid (ABA) signalling in guard cells. Overexpression of the ASPG1 gene  enhanced ABA sensitivity in guard cells and reduced water loss in ectopically  overexpressing ASPG1 (ASPG1-OE) transgenic plants. In ASPG1-OE plants, some  downstream targets in ABA and/or drought-signalling pathways were altered at  various levels, suggesting the involvement of ASPG1 in ABA-dependent drought  avoidance in Arabidopsis. By analysing the activities of several antioxidases  including superoxide dismutase and catalase in ASPG1-OE plants, the existence was  demonstrated of an effective detoxification system for drought avoidance in these  plants. Analysis of ProASPG1-GUS lines showed a predominant guard cell expression  pattern in various aerial tissues. Moreover, the protease activity of ASPG1 was  characterized in vitro, and two aspartic acid sites, D180 and D379, were found to  be key residues for ASPG1 aspartic protease activity in response to ABA. In  summary, these findings suggest that functional ASPG1 may be involved in  ABA-dependent responsiveness and that overexpression of the ASPG1 gene can confer  drought avoidance in Arabidopsis.', '2012 Apr', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/err433', 'Wu']
