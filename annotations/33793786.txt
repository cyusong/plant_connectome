Ethylene is an important phytohormone with pleotropic roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2) mediates the transduction of the ethylene signal from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane to the nucleus, where its C-terminus (EIN2-C) regulates histone acetylation to mediate transcriptional regulation by EIN3. However, no direct interaction between EIN2-C and EIN3 has been detected. To determine how EIN2-C and EIN3 act together, we followed a synthetic approach and engineered a chimeric EIN2-C with EIN3 DNA-binding activity but lacking its transactivation activity (EIN2C-EIN3DB). The overexpression of EIN2C-EIN3DB in either wild-type or in the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein3-1 eil1-1 led to a partial constitutive ethylene response. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing showed that EIN2C-EIN3DB has DNA-binding activity, indicating that EIN3DB is functional in EIN2C-EIN3DB. Furthermore, native EIN3 protein levels determine EIN2C-EIN3DB binding activity and binding targets in a positive feedback loop by interacting with EIN2C-EIN3DB to form a heterodimer. Additionally, although EIN3 does not direct affect histone acetylation levels in the absence of EIN2, it is required for the ethylene-induced elevation of H3K14Ac and H3K23Ac in the presence of EIN2. Together, we reveal efficient and specific DNA-binding by dimerized EIN3 in the presence of ethylene to mediate positive feedback regulation, which is required for EIN2-directed elevation of histone acetylation to integrate into an EIN3-dependent transcriptional activation.
