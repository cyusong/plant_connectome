Association of RNA polymerase V (Pol V) with chromatin is a critical step for RNA- directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in plants. Although the methylated DNA-binding proteins SUVH2 and SUVH9 and the chromatin remodeler-containing complex DRD1-DMS3-RDM1 are known to be required for the association of Pol V with chromatin, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association of Pol V with different chromatin environments remain largely unknown. Here we found that SUVH9 interacts with FVE, a homolog of the mammalian retinoblastoma-associated protein, which has been previously identified as a shared subunit of the histone deacetylase complex and the polycomb-type histone H3K27 trimethyltransferase complex. We demonstrated that FVE facilitates the association of Pol V with chromatin and thus contributes to DNA methylation at a substantial subset of RdDM target loci. Compared with FVE-independent RdDM target loci, FVE-dependent RdDM target loci are more abundant in gene-rich chromosome arms than in pericentromeric heterochromatin regions. This study contributes to our understanding of how the association of Pol V with chromatin is regulated in different chromatin environments.
