Auxin response factors (ARFs) are important regulators modulating the expression of auxin-responsive genes in various biological processes in plants. In the <i>Populus</i> genome, a total of 39 ARF members have been identified, but their detailed functions are still unclear. In this study, six poplar auxin response factor 2 (PtrARF2) members were isolated from <i>P. trichocarpa.</i> Expression pattern analysis showed that <i>PtrARF2.1</i> is highly expressed in leaf tissues compared with other <i>PtrARF2</i> genes and significantly repressed by exogenous auxin treatment. PtrARF2.1 is a nuclear-localized protein without transcriptional activation activity. Knockdown of <i>PtrARF2.1</i> by RNA interference (RNAi) in poplars led to the dwarf plant, altered leaf shape, and reduced size of the leaf blade, while overexpression of <i>PtrARF2.1</i> resulted in a slight reduction in plant height and the similar leaf phenotype in contrast to the wildtype. Furthermore, histological staining analysis revealed an ectopic deposition of lignin in leaf veins and petioles of <i>PtrARF2.1-RNAi</i> lines. RNA-Seq analysis showed that 74 differential expression genes (DEGs) belonging to 12 transcription factor families, such as NAM, ATAF and CUC (NAC), v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB), ethylene response factors (ERF) and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), were identified in <i>PtrARF2.1-RNAi</i> leaves and other 24 DEGs were associated with the lignin biosynthetic pathway. Altogether, the data indicate that PtrARF2.1 plays an important role in regulating leaf development and influences the lignin biosynthesis in poplars.
