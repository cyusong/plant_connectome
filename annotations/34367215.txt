<i>Sapindus mukorossi</i> Gaertn., an important oleaginous woody plant, has garnered increasing research attention owing to its potential as a source of renewable energy (biodiesel). Leaf structural traits are closely related to plant size, and they affect the fruit yield and oil quality. However, plant size factors that predominantly contribute to leaf structural traits remain unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand the associations between leaf structural traits and plant size factors in even-aged stands of <i>S. mukorossi</i>. Results showed that leaf length (LL) and leaf area (LA) markedly increased with the increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (TH), although other leaf structural traits did not show noticeable changes. Difference in slopes also indicated that the degree of effect of plant size factors on leaf structural traits was in the order of TH > DBH. Leaf structural traits showed no systematic variation with crown width (CW). LA was significantly positively correlated with LL, leaf width (LW), LL/LW, and leaf thickness (LT) and was significantly but negatively correlated with leaf tissue density (LTD) and leaf dry mass content (LDMC). Specific leaf area showed a significantly negative correlation with LT, LDMC, and LTD. LTD showed a significantly positive correlation with LDMC, but a negative correlation with LT. The results were critical to understand the variability of leaf structural traits with plant size, can provide a theoretical foundation for further study in the relationship between leaf structural traits and fruit yield, and regulate leaf traits through artificial management measures to promote plant growth and fruit yield.
