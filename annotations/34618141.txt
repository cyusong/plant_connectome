Plant leaves have evolved into diverse shapes and LATE MERISTEM IDENTITY1 (LMI1) and its putative paralogous genes encode homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factors that are proposed evolutionary hotspots for the regulation of leaf development in plants. However, the LMI1-mediated regulatory mechanism underlying leaf shape formation is largely unknown. MtLMI1a and MtLMI1b are putative orthologs of LMI1 in the model legume barrelclover (Medicago truncatula). Here, we investigated the role of MtLMI1a and MtLMI1b in leaf margin morphogenesis by characterizing loss-of-function mutants. MtLMI1a and MtLMI1b are expressed along leaf margin in a near-complementary pattern, and they redundantly promote development of leaf margin serrations, as revealed by the relatively smooth leaf margin in their double mutants. Moreover, MtLMI1s directly activate expression of SMOOTH LEAF MARGIN1 (SLM1), which encodes an auxin efflux carrier, thereby regulating auxin distribution along the leaf margin. Further analysis indicates that MtLMI1s genetically interact with NO APICAL MERISTEM (MtNAM) and the ARGONAUTE7 (MtAGO7)-mediated trans-acting short interfering RNA3 (TAS3 ta-siRNA) pathway to develop the final leaf margin shape. The participation of MtLMI1s in auxin-dependent leaf margin formation is interesting in the context of functional conservation. Furthermore, the diverse expression patterns of LMI1s and their putative paralogs within key domains are important drivers for functional specialization, despite their functional equivalency among species.
