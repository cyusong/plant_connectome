We investigated the role of gibberellins (GAs) in the phenotype of parthenocarpic fruit (pat), a recessive mutation conferring parthenocarpy in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Novel phenotypes that parallel those reported in plants repeatedly treated with gibberellic acid or having a GA-constitutive response indicate that the pat mutant probably expresses high levels of GA. The retained sensitivity to the GA-biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol reveals that this condition is dependent on GA biosynthesis. Expression analysis of genes encoding key enzymes involved in GA biosynthesis shows that in normal tomato ovaries, the GA20ox1 transcript is in low copy number before anthesis and only pollination and fertilization increase its transcription levels and, thus, GA biosynthesis. In the unpollinated ovaries of the pat mutant, this mechanism is de-regulated and GA20ox1 is constitutively expressed, indicating that a high GA concentration could play a part in the parthenocarpic phenotype. The levels of endogenous GAs measured in the floral organs of the pat mutant support such a hypothesis. Collectively, the data indicate that transcriptional regulation of GA20ox1 mediates pollination-induced fruit set in tomato and that parthenocarpy in pat results from the mis-regulation of this mechanism. As genes involved in the control of GA synthesis (LeT6, LeT12 and LeCUC2) and response (SPY) are also altered in the pat ovary, it is suggested that the pat mutation affects a regulatory gene located upstream of the control of fruit set exerted by GAs.
