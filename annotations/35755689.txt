<i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i> Georgi. (Chinese skullcap or Huang-qin) is an extremely crucial medicinal plant in the Labiate family, and the color of its flowers naturally appears purple. However, during the long-term cultivation of <i>S</i>. <i>baicalensis</i>, very few plants of <i>S</i>. <i>baicalensis</i> also present white and purple-red flower colors under the same ecological conditions. However, the complex metabolic and transcriptional networks underlying color formation in white, purple-red, and purple flowers of <i>S</i>. <i>baicalensis</i> remain largely unclarified. To gain an insight into this issue, we conducted transcriptome and metabolomic profiling to elucidate the anthocyanin synthesis metabolic pathway in the flowers of <i>S</i>. <i>baicalensis</i>, and to identify the differentially expressed candidate genes potentially involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins. The results showed that 15 anthocyanins were identified, among which cyanidin 3-rutinoside and delphin chloride were the primary anthocyanins, and accumulation was significantly related to the flower color changes of <i>S</i>. <i>baicalensis</i>. Furthermore, the down-regulation of <i>SbDFR</i> (<i>Sb02g31040</i>) reduced the anthocyanin levels in the flowers of <i>S</i>. <i>baicalensis</i>. The differential expression of the <i>Sb3GT</i> (<i>Sb07g04780</i> and <i>Sb01g72290</i>) gene in purple and purple-red flowers affected anthocyanin accumulation, suggesting that anthocyanin levels were closely associated with the expression of <i>SbDFR</i> and <i>Sb3GT</i>, which play important roles in regulating the anthocyanin biosynthesis process of <i>S</i>. <i>baicalensis</i> flowers. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that transcription factors WRKY, bHLH, and NAC were also highly correlated with anthocyanin accumulation, especially for NAC35, which positively regulated <i>SbDFR</i> (<i>Sb02g31040</i>) gene expression and modulated anthocyanin biosynthesis in flower color variation of <i>S</i>. <i>baicalensis</i>. Overall, this study presents the first experimental evidence for the metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles of <i>S</i>. <i>baicalensis</i> in response to flower coloration, which provides a foundation for dynamic metabolic engineering and plant breeding, and to understand floral evolution in <i>S</i>. <i>baicalensis</i> plants.
