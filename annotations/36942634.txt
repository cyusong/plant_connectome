Root hairs are epidermal cell extensions that increase the root surface for water and nutrient acquisition. Thus, both the initiation and elongation of root hairs are critical for soil exploration and plant adaptation to ever changing growth conditions. Here, we describe the critical roles of two subunits of the Mediator complex, MED12 and MED13, in root hair growth in response to sucrose and abscisic acid, which are tightly linked to abiotic stress resistance. When compared to the WT, <i>med12</i> and <i>med13</i> mutants showed increased sensitivity to sucrose and ABA treatments on root meristem and elongation zones that were accompanied with alterations in root hair length and morphology, leading to the isodiametric growth of these structures. The swollen root hair phenotype appeared to be specific, since <i>med8</i> or <i>med16</i> mutants did not develop rounded hairs when supplied with 4.8% sucrose. Under standard growth medium, MED12 and MED13 were mainly expressed in root vascular tissues and cotyledons, and their expression was repressed by sucrose or ABA. Interestingly, <i>med12</i> and <i>med13</i> mutants manifested exacerbated levels of nitric oxide under normal growth conditions, and upon sucrose supplementation in trichoblast cells, which coincided with root hair deformation. Our results indicate that MED12 and MED13 play non-redundant functions for maintenance of root hair integrity in response to sucrose and ABA and involve nitric oxide as a cellular messenger in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.
