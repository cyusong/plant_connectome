The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen induces intracellular signaling mediated by the ER stress sensor protein IRE1. Our recent study identified a new common cis-element of ER stress-responsive genes (such as rice BiP paralogs and WRKY45) that were regulated via an IRE1-dependent pathway. ER stress-responsive cis-elements had been expected to be conserved between plants and mammals. However, contrary to expectations, sequences of the plant cis-element, pUPRE-II, were not identical to those of its mammalian counterpart. Additionally, pUPRE-II also interacted with another ER stress sensor protein and mediated multiple signaling pathways. Here, we provide a summary of the results that suggest the complicated mechanism underlying the regulation of ER stress-responsive gene expression in plants.

IRE1: !mediates! Intracellular signaling
pUPRE-II: !interacts with! IRE1
pUPRE-II: !interacts with! Another ER stress sensor protein
ER stress-responsive genes: !regulated by! IRE1-dependent pathway
ER stress-responsive cis-elements: !not conserved between! Plants and mammals
