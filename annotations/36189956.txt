Photosystem II (PSII) contains many lipid molecules that are essential for the function and maintenance of PSII. Under strong light conditions, PSII complexes are dynamically modified during the repair process; however, the molecular mechanism of the dynamic changes in the PSII structure is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of a lipase in the repair of PSII in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We identified a protein encoded by the sll1969 gene, previously named lipase A (lipA), in the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genome as a candidate for the lipase involved in PSII repair. Recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli cells hydrolyzed fatty acids at the sn-1 position of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol as well as triacylglycerol esterified with stearic acids. PSII repair in a disrupted mutant of the lipA gene was suppressed by the slow degradation of damaged D1 protein under strong light. The level of the PSII dimer remained higher in lipA mutant cells than wild-type (WT) cells under strong light. LipA protein was associated with the PSII dimer in vivo, and recombinant LipA protein decomposed PSII dimers purified from WT cells to monomers by reducing MGDG content in the PSII complex. These results indicate that LipA reacts with PSII dimers, dissociates them into monomers by digesting MGDG, and enhances D1 degradation during PSII repair.
