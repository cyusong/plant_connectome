['16507085', "We have investigated the relationship between seed dormancy and abscisic acid  (ABA) metabolism in the monocot barley and the dicot Arabidopsis. Whether dormant  (D) or non-dormant (ND), dry seed of Arabidopsis and embryos of dry barley grains  all had similarly high levels of ABA. ABA levels decreased rapidly upon  imbibition, although they fell further in ND than in D. Gene expression profiles  were determined in Arabidopsis for key ABA biosynthetic [the 9-cis  epoxycarotenoid dioxygenasegene family] and ABA catabolic [the ABA 8'-hydroxylase  gene family (CYP707A)] genes. Of these, only the AtCYP707A2 gene was  differentially expressed between D and ND seeds, being expressed to a much higher  level in ND seeds. Similarly, a barley CYP707 homologue, (HvABA8'OH-1) was  expressed to a much higher level in embryos from ND grains than from D grains.  Consistent with this, in situ hybridization studies showed HvABA8'OH-1 mRNA  expression was stronger in embryos from ND grains. Surprisingly, the signal was  confined in the coleorhiza, suggesting that this tissue plays a key role in  dormancy release. Constitutive expression of a CYP707A gene in transgenic  Arabidopsis resulted in decreased ABA content in mature dry seeds and a much  shorter after-ripening period to overcome dormancy. Conversely, mutating the  CYP707A2 gene resulted in seeds that required longer after-ripening to break  dormancy. Our results point to a pivotal role for the ABA 8'-hydroxylase gene in  controlling dormancy and that the action of this enzyme may be confined to a  particular organ as in the coleorhiza of cereals.", '2006 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02659.x', 'Gubler']
