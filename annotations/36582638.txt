Sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) is a class of plant-specific serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase that plays an important role in rice stress tolerance, growth and development. However, systematic bioinformatics and expression pattern analysis have not been reported. In the current study, ten <i>OsSnRK2</i> genes were identified in the rice genome and located on 7 chromosomes, which can be classified into three subfamilies (I, II, and III). Many <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements were identified in the promoter region of <i>OsSnRK2</i> genes, including hormone response elements, defense and stress responsive elements, indicating that the <i>OsSnRK2</i> family may play a crucial role in response to hormonal and abiotic stress. Quantitative tissue analysis showed that <i>OsSnRK2</i> genes expressed in all tissues of rice, but the expression abundance varied from different tissues and showed varietal variability. In addition, expression pattern of <i>OsSnRK2</i> were analyzed under abiotic stress (salt, drought, salt and drought) and showed obvious difference in diverse abiotic stress. In general, these results provide useful information for understanding the <i>OsSnRK2</i> gene family and analyzing its functions in rice in response to ABA, salt and drought stress, especially salt-drought combined stress.
