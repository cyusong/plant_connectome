Glutathione and phytochelatins are sulfur containing compounds playing an important role in cadmium (Cd) detoxification. We examined the Cd-induced changes in the percentage of sulfur containing compounds to total sulfur in wild-type and sulfate transporter 1;2 knockout mutant, sel1-10. Cd treatment increased the proportion of sulfate and thiols in the total sulfur content. Among the thiols analyzed, the proportion of cysteine and glutathione were decreased by the Cd treatment and that of the phytochelatins were increased. Although the total sulfur content in sel1-10 was decreased compared with that in wild-type, the percentages of individual thiol in the total thiol content were similarly maintained between sel1-10 and wild-type, suggesting that plants tightly controlled the balance of each thiol under Cd treatment.

Cd: !increases! Proportion of sulfate and thiols
Cd: !decreases! Proportion of cysteine and glutathione
Cd: !increases! Proportion of phytochelatins
sel1-10: !decreases! Total sulfur content
sel1-10: !maintains! Balance of each thiol
