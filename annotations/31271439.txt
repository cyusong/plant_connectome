Photosynthetic induction, a gradual increase in photosynthetic rate on a transition from darkness or low light to high light, has ecological significance, impact on biomass accumulation in fluctuating light and relevance to photoprotection in strong light. However, the experimental quantification of the component electron fluxes in and around both photosystems during induction has been rare. Combining optimized chlorophyll fluorescence, the redox kinetics of P700 [primary electron donor in Photosystem I (PSI)] and membrane inlet mass spectrometry in the absence/presence of inhibitors/mediator, we partially estimated the components of electron fluxes in spinach leaf disks on transition from darkness to 1,000 �mol photons�m-2�s-1 for up to 10 min, obtaining the following findings: (i) the partitioning of energy between both photosystems did not change noticeably; (ii) in Photosystem II (PSII), the combined cyclic electron flow (CEF2) and charge recombination (CR2) to the ground state decreased gradually toward 0 in steady state; (iii) oxygen reduction by electrons from PSII, partly bypassing PSI, was small but measurable; (iv) cyclic electron flow around PSI (CEF1) peaked before becoming somewhat steady; (v) peak magnitudes of some of the electron fluxes, all probably photoprotective, were in the descending order: CEF1 > CEF2 + CR2 > chloroplast O2 uptake; and (vi) the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex appeared to aid the antimycin A-sensitive CEF1. The results are important for fine-tuning in silico simulation of in vivo photosynthetic electron transport processes; such simulation is, in turn, necessary to probe partial processes in a complex network of interactions in response to environmental changes.
