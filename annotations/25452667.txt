['25452667', 'Iron uptake and metabolism are tightly regulated in both plants and animals. In  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), BRUTUS (BTS), which contains three  hemerythrin (HHE) domains and a Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain,  interacts with basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that are capable of  forming heterodimers with POPEYE (PYE), a positive regulator of the iron  deficiency response. BTS has been shown to have E3 ligase capacity and to play a  role in root growth, rhizosphere acidification, and iron reductase activity in  response to iron deprivation. To further characterize the function of this  protein, we examined the expression pattern of recombinant  ProBTS::beta-GLUCURONIDASE and found that it is expressed in developing embryos and  other reproductive tissues, corresponding with its apparent role in reproductive  growth and development. Our findings also indicate that the interactions between  BTS and PYE-like (PYEL) basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors occur within  the nucleus and are dependent on the presence of the RING domain. We provide  evidence that BTS facilitates 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of PYEL  proteins in the absence of iron. We also determined that, upon binding iron at  the HHE domains, BTS is destabilized and that this destabilization relies on  specific residues within the HHE domains. This study reveals an important and  unique mechanism for plant iron homeostasis whereby an E3 ubiquitin ligase may  posttranslationally control components of the transcriptional regulatory network  involved in the iron deficiency response.', '2015 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.250837', 'Long']
