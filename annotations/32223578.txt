<i>Bacillus</i> sp. strain WR11 isolated from the root of wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) possesses abiotic stress alleviating properties and produces several types of enzymes. However, its genomic information is lacking. The study described the complete genome sequence of the bacterium. The size of the genome was 4 202 080 base pairs that consisted of 4 405 genes in total. The G+C content of the circular genome was 43.53% and there were 4 170 coding genes, 114 pseudo genes, 30 ribosome RNAs, 86 tRNAs, and 5 ncRNAs, based on the Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP). Many genes were related to the stress-alleviating properties and 124 genes existed in the CAZy database. The complete genome data of strain WR11 will provide valuable resources for genetic dissection of its plant growth-promoting function and symbiotic interaction with plant.
