['12586887', 'Tocopherols are essential components of the human diet and are synthesized  exclusively by photosynthetic organisms. These lipophilic antioxidants consist of  a chromanol ring and a 15-carbon tail derived from homogentisate (HGA) and phytyl  diphosphate, respectively. Condensation of HGA and phytyl diphosphate, the  committed step in tocopherol biosynthesis, is catalyzed by HGA phytyltransferase  (HPT). To investigate whether HPT activity is limiting for tocopherol synthesis  in plants, the gene encoding Arabidopsis HPT, HPT1, was constitutively  overexpressed in Arabidopsis. In leaves, HPT1 overexpression resulted in a  10-fold increase in HPT specific activity and a 4.4-fold increase in total  tocopherol content relative to wild type. In seeds, HPT1 overexpression resulted  in a 4-fold increase in HPT specific activity and a total seed tocopherol content  that was 40% higher than wild type, primarily because of an increase in  gamma-tocopherol content. This enlarged pool of gamma-tocopherol was almost  entirely converted to alpha-tocopherol by crossing HPT1 overexpressing plants  with lines constitutively overexpressing gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase. Seed  of the resulting double overexpressing lines had a 12-fold increase in vitamin E  activity relative to wild type. These results indicate that HPT activity is  limiting in various Arabidopsis tissues and that total tocopherol levels and  vitamin E activity can be elevated in leaves and seeds by combined overexpression  of the HPT1 and gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase genes.', '2003 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.015222', 'DellaPenna']
