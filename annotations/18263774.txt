['18263774', 'The infection of plants by obligate parasitic nematodes constitutes an  interesting model for investigating plant cytoskeleton functions. Root knot  nematodes have evolved the ability to manipulate host functions to their own  advantage by redifferentiating root cells into multinucleate and hypertrophied  feeding cells. These giant cells result from repeated rounds of karyokinesis  without cell division. Detailed functional analyses demonstrated that Arabidopsis  thaliana Microtubule-Associated Protein65-3 (MAP65-3) was essential for giant  cell ontogenesis and that cytokinesis was initiated but not completed in giant  cells. In developing giant cells, MAP65-3 was associated with a novel kind of  cell plate-the giant cell mini cell plate-that separates daughter nuclei. In the  absence of functional MAP65-3, giant cells developed but failed to fully  differentiate and were eventually destroyed. These defects in giant cells  impaired the maturation of nematode larvae. Thus, MAP65-3 is essential for giant  cell development during root knot nematode infection. Subcellular localization of  MAP65-3 and analysis of microtubule organization in the dyc283 T-DNA map65-3  mutant demonstrated that MAP65-3 played a critical role in organizing the mitotic  microtubule array during both early and late mitosis in all plant organs. Here,  we propose a model for the role of MAP65-3 in giant cell ontogenesis.', '2008 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.057422', 'Favery']
