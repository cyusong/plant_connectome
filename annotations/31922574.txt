Stem cells undergo cell division and differentiation to ensure organized tissue development. Because plant cells are immobile, plant stem cells ought to decide their cell fate prior to differentiation, to locate specialized cells in the correct position. In this study, based on a chemical screen, we isolated a novel secondary cell wall indicator BF-170, which binds to lignin and can be used to image in vitro and in situ xylem development. Use of BF-170 to observe the vascular differentiation pattern in the in vitro vascular cell induction system, VISUAL, revealed that adaxial mesophyll cells of cotyledons predominantly generate ectopic xylem cells. Moreover, phloem cells are abundantly produced on the abaxial layer, suggesting the involvement of leaf adaxial-abaxial polarity in determining vascular cell fate. Analysis of abaxial polarity mutants highlighted the role of YAB3, an abaxial cell fate regulator, in suppressing xylem and promoting phloem differentiation on the abaxial domains in VISUAL. Furthermore, YABBY family genes affected in vivo vascular development during the secondary growth. Our results denoted the possibility that such mediators of spatial information contribute to correctly determine the cell fate of vascular stem cells, to conserve the vascular pattern of land plants.
