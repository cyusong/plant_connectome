['20377688', 'Carbohydrate metabolism is central to plant growth and development. However,  little is known about its role in embryogenesis. Here, we report the  characterization of multiple alleles of the BRANCHING ENZYME1 (BE1) gene (also  known as EMB2729). The weak allele of be1-3, characterized by positional cloning,  carries a single-nucleotide substitution in an exon-intron junction and shows  various developmental defects during post-germination growth. This mutation  causes a reduced level of BE1 mRNA that, likely generated from cryptically  spliced pre-mRNA, contains a Glu-to-Lys substitution at codon 366. In four null  alleles, BE1 is disrupted by T-DNA insertions, causing embryo developmental  arrests at the heart stage. Light microscopy reveals reduced cell divisions and  abnormal cell differentiation, thereby leading to defects in setting up the shoot  apical meristem, embryonic vascular tissues and cotyledons. Overexpression of BE1  results in a pleiotropic phenotype, indicating that the fine-tuned BE1 level is  crucial for plant growth and development. BE1 encodes a putative glycoside  hydrolase that is highly conserved in higher plants. A BE1-GFP fusion protein,  which is fully functional in complementing be1 mutants, is localized in plastids.  The be1-3 phenotype can be partially rescued by glucose, fructose or sucrose,  implying the involvement of BE1 in carbohydrate metabolism in plastids.', '2010 Mar', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/j.1744-7909.2010.00930.x', 'Zuo']
