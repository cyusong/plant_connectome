This study is aimed to understand the role of life-history traits in determining the genetic structure of populations. We used Erythroxylum havanense, a distylous shrub with synchronous and massive patterns of flowering and fruiting. We suggest that the high concentration of ephemeral resources produced by mass flowering satiates both pollinators and frugivores, restricting gene flow and leading to genetic differentiation among populations. Using random amplified polymorphic DNAs as genetic markers, we estimated genetic diversity and structure statistics to quantify the amount and distribution of genetic variation within and among five populations from the Pacific coast of Mexico. High levels of genetic variation within populations and significant differentiation among populations located very near to each other were found. Furthermore, spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated the presence of significant genetic structure at short spatial distances. We suggest that by influencing the foraging behavior of pollinators and frugivores, mass flowering may produce the observed patterns of genetic structure, while small differences in flowering or fruiting phenology could further reinforce the isolation of nearby populations.
