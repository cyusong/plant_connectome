Plant laccases, as multicopper oxidases, play an important role in monolignol polymerization, and participate in the resistance response of plants to multiple biotic/abiotic stresses. However, little is currently known about the role of laccases in the cold stress response of plants. In this study, the laccase activity and lignin content of <i>C. sinensis</i> leaves increased after the low-temperature treatment, and cold treatment induced the differential regulation of 21 <i>CsLACs</i>, with 15 genes being upregulated and 6 genes being downregulated. Exceptionally, the relative expression level of <i>CsLAC18</i> increased 130.17-fold after a 48-h treatment. The full-length coding sequence of <i>CsLAC18</i> consists of 1743 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 580 amino acids, and is predominantly expressed in leaves and fruits. CsLAC18 was phylogenetically related to AtLAC17, and was localized in the cell membrane. Overexpression of <i>CsLAC18</i> conferred enhanced cold tolerance on transgenic tobacco; however, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)-mediated suppression of <i>CsLAC18</i> in <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i> significantly impaired resistance to cold stress. As a whole, our findings revealed that <i>CsLAC18</i> positively regulates a plant's response to cold stress, providing a potential target for molecular breeding or gene editing.
