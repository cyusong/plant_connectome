Entomopathogenic fungi are gaining acceptance in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems as effective and environmental safety biological control agents to protect a great variety of crops against pest insects. Many of these insect-pathogenic fungi can establish themselves as endophytes and thereby may induce the plant immune system. The activation of plant defenses by the fungal endophytic colonization can have a direct impact on herbivores and plant pathogens. An integral component of many plant defense responses is also the release of volatile organic compounds, which may serve as an indirect defense by attracting the natural enemies of herbivores. Here we investigated the effect of endophytic colonization by the entomopathogenic fungus <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> on the volatile emission by melon and cotton plants, either unharmed or after being damaged by sap-sucking aphids or leaf chewing caterpillars. We found that when the plants are colonized by <i>B. bassiana</i> they emit a different blend of volatile compounds compared to uncolonized control plants. Some of the emitted compounds have been reported previously to be released in response to herbivory and have been implicated in natural enemy attraction. Several of the compounds are also known to have antimicrobial properties. Therefore, endophytic colonization by <i>B. bassiana</i> might help to not only direct control insect pests but also increase the resistance of plants against agronomically important pests and phytopathogens.

Beauveria bassiana: !colonizes! Melon and Cotton plants
Melon and Cotton plants: !emit! Different volatile compounds
Different volatile compounds: !attract! Natural enemies of herbivores
Different volatile compounds: !have antimicrobial properties!
