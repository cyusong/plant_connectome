In natural growth habitats, plants face constant, unpredictable changes in light conditions. To avoid damage to the photosynthetic apparatus on thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts, and to avoid wasteful reactions, it is crucial to maintain a redox balance both within the components of photosynthetic electron transfer chain and between the light reactions and stromal carbon metabolism under fluctuating light conditions. This requires coordinated function of the photoprotective and regulatory mechanisms, such as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and reversible redistribution of excitation energy between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI). In this paper, we show that the NADPH-dependent chloroplast thioredoxin system (NTRC) is involved in the control of the activation of these mechanisms. In plants with altered NTRC content, the strict correlation between lumenal pH and NPQ is partially lost. We propose that NTRC contributes to downregulation of a slow-relaxing constituent of NPQ, whose induction is independent of lumenal acidification. Additionally, overexpression of NTRC enhances the ability to adjust the excitation balance between PSII and PSI, and improves the ability to oxidize the electron transfer chain during changes in light conditions. Thiol regulation allows coupling of the electron transfer chain to the stromal redox state during these changes.
