Jackfruit (<i>Artocarpus heterophyllus</i> Lam.) is the national fruit of Bangladesh and produces fruit in the summer season only. However, jackfruit is not commercially grown in Bangladesh because of an extremely high variation in fruit quality, short seasonal fruiting (June-August) and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Conversely, a year-round high yielding (ca. 4-fold higher than the seasonal variety) jackfruit variety, BARI Kanthal-3 developed by the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) derived from a wild accession found in Ramgarh of Chattogram Hiltracts of Bangladesh, provides fruits from September to June. This study aimed to generate a draft whole-genome sequence (WGS) of BARI Kanthal-3 to obtain molecular insights including genes associated with year-round fruiting trait of this important unique variety. The estimated genome size of BARI Kanthal-3 was 1.04-gigabase-pair (Gbp) with a heterozygosity rate of 1.62%. <i>De novo</i> assembly yielded a scaffolded 817.7 Mb genome while a reference-guided approach, yielded 843 Mb of genome sequence. The estimated GC content was 34.10%. Variant analysis revealed that BARI Kanthal-3 included 5.7 M (35%) and 10.4 M (65%) simple and heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and about 90% of all these polymorphisms are in inter-genic regions. Through BUSCO assessment, 97.2% of the core genes were represented in the assembly with 1.3% and 1.5% either fragmented or missing, respectively. By comparing identified orthologous gene groups in BARI Kanthal-3 with five closely and one distantly related species of 10,092 common orthogroups were found across the genomes of the six species. The phylogenetic analysis of the shared orthogroups showed that <i>A. heterophyllus</i> was the closest species to BARI Kanthal-3 and orthogroups related to flowering time were found to be more highly prevalent in BARI Kanthal-3 compared to the other <i>Arctocarpus</i> spp. The findings of this study will help better understanding the evolution, domestication, phylogenetic relationships, year-round fruiting of this highly nutritious fruit crop as well as providing a resource for molecular breeding.
