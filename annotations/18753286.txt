['18753286', 'Transporters for di- and tripeptides belong to the large and poorly characterized  PTR/NRT1 (peptide transporter/nitrate transporter 1) family. A new member of this  gene family, AtPTR5, was isolated from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).  Expression of AtPTR5 was analyzed and compared with tissue specificity of the  closely related AtPTR1 to discern their roles in planta. Both transporters  facilitate transport of dipeptides with high affinity and are localized at the  plasma membrane. Mutants, double mutants, and overexpressing lines were exposed  to several dipeptides, including toxic peptides, to analyze how the modified  transporter expression affects pollen germination, growth of pollen tubes, root,  and shoot. Analysis of atptr5 mutants and AtPTR5-overexpressing lines showed that  AtPTR5 facilitates peptide transport into germinating pollen and possibly into  maturating pollen, ovules, and seeds. In contrast, AtPTR1 plays a role in uptake  of peptides by roots indicated by reduced nitrogen (N) levels and reduced growth  of atptr1 mutants on medium with dipeptides as the sole N source. Furthermore,  overexpression of AtPTR5 resulted in enhanced shoot growth and increased N  content. The function in peptide uptake was further confirmed with toxic  peptides, which inhibited growth. The results show that closely related members  of the PTR/NRT1 family have different functions in planta. This study also  provides evidence that the use of organic N is not restricted to amino acids, but  that dipeptides should be considered as a N source and transport form in plants.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.123844', 'Rentsch']
