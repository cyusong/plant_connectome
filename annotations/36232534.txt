With the aim of searching for phytochemicals with aromatase inhibitory activity, five new prenylcoumarins, mammeasins K (<b>1</b>), L (<b>2</b>), M (<b>3</b>), N (<b>4</b>), and O (<b>5</b>), were isolated from the methanolic extract of <i>Mammea siamensis</i> (Miq.) T. Anders. flowers (fam. Calophyllaceae), originating in Thailand. The stereostructures of <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> were elucidated based on their spectroscopic properties. Among the new compounds, <b>1</b> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7.6 然) and <b>5</b> (9.1 然) possessed relatively strong inhibitory activity against aromatase, which is a target of drugs already used in clinical practice for the treatment and prevention of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. The analysis through Lineweaver-Burk plots showed that they competitively inhibit aromatase (<b>1</b>, <i>K</i>i = 3.4 然 and <b>5</b>, 2.3 然). Additionally, the most potent coumarin constituent, mammea B/AB cyclo D (<b>31</b>, <i>K</i>i = 0.84 然), had a competitive inhibitory activity equivalent to that of aminoglutethimide (0.84 然), an aromatase inhibitor used in therapeutics.
