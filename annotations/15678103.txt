In recent years, considerable progress has been made in unraveling the control mechanisms operating on the plant cell cycle and most of the key regulators have now been identified, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), cyclins, CDK-inhibitory proteins, the WEE kinase and proteins of the retinoblastoma-related protein (RBR)/E2F/DP pathway. The review discusses recent developments in our understanding of the plant cell cycle machinery and highlights the role of the cell cycle in plant development.

CDKs: !regulate! Cyclins
Cyclins: !activate! CDKs
CDK-inhibitory proteins: !inhibit! CDKs
WEE kinase: !regulates! RBR/E2F/DP pathway
RBR/E2F/DP pathway: !controls! Cell cycle
