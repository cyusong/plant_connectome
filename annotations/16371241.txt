['16371241', "RecQ helicases are conserved throughout all kingdoms of life regarding their  overall structure and function. They are 3'-5' DNA helicases resolving different  recombinogenic DNA structures. The RecQ helicases are key factors in a number of  DNA repair and recombination pathways involved in the maintenance of genome  integrity. In eukaryotes the number of RecQ genes and the structure of RecQ  proteins vary strongly between organisms. Therefore, they have been named  RecQ-like genes. Knockouts of several RecQ-like genes cause severe diseases in  animals or harmful cellular phenotypes in yeast. Until now the largest number of  RecQ-like genes per organism has been found in plants. Arabidopsis and rice  possess seven different RecQ-like genes each. In the almost completely sequenced  genome of the moss Physcomitrella patens at least five RecQ-like genes are  present. One of the major present and future research aims is to define putative  plant-specific functions and to assign their roles in DNA repair and  recombination pathways in relation to RecQ genes from other eukaryotes. Regarding  their intron positions, the structures of six RecQ-like genes of dicots and  monocots are virtually identical indicating a conservation over a time scale of  150 million years. In contrast to other eukaryotes one gene (RecQsim) exists  exclusively in plants. It possesses an interrupted helicase domain but  nevertheless seems to have maintained the RecQ function. Owing to a recent gene  duplication besides the AtRecQl4A gene an additional RecQ-like gene (AtRecQl4B)  exists in the Brassicaceae only. Genetic studies indicate that a AtRecQl4A  knockout results in sensitivity to mutagens as well as an hyper-recombination  phenotype. Since AtRecQl4B was still present, both genes must have non-redundant  roles. Analysis of plant RecQ-like genes will not only increase the knowledge on  DNA repair and recombination, but also on the evolution and radiation of protein  families.", '2006 Feb', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2005.10.013', 'Puchta']
