After harvest, cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) storage roots undergo rapid postharvest physiological deterioration, producing blue-brown discoloration in the vasculature due to the production of polyphenolics (mainly quinones and coumarins) by enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Here, we report the application of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL), a natural PPO inhibitor, in transgenic cassava to repress the symptoms of postharvest physiological deterioration. The HEWL-expressing transgenic plants had lower levels of the two main cassava coumarins tested, scopoletin and scopolin, compared with wild type. HEWL-expressing cassava also showed increased tolerance of oxidative stress. Overall, the lysozyme-PPO system proved to be functional in plants for repressing PPO-mediated commercial product browning.

HEWL: !represses! PPO
HEWL: !inhibits! Postharvest physiological deterioration
PPO: !produces! Polyphenolics
Polyphenolics: !cause! Blue-brown discoloration
HEWL: !lowers! Scopoletin and scopolin
HEWL: !increases! Tolerance of oxidative stress
