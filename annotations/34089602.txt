Brassinosteroid-insensitive-1 (BRI1) plays important roles in various signalling pathways controlling plant growth and development. However, the regulatory mechanism of BRI1 in brassinosteroid (BR)-mediated signalling for shoot growth and wood formation in woody plants is largely unknown. In this study, PtBRI1.2, a brassinosteroid-insensitive-1 gene, was overexpressed in poplar. Shoot growth and wood formation of transgenic plants were examined and the regulatory genes involved were verified. PtBRI1.2 was localized to the plasma membrane, with a predominant expression in leaves. Ectopic expression of PtBRI1.2 in Arabidopsis bri1-201 and bri1-5 mutants rescued their retarded-growth phenotype. Overexpression of PtBRI1.2 in poplar promoted shoot growth and wood formation in transgenic plants. Further studies revealed that overexpression of PtBRI1.2 promoted the accumulation of PtBZR1 (BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1) in the nucleus, which subsequently activated PtWNDs (WOOD-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN transcription factors) to up-regulate expression of secondary cell wall biosynthesis genes involved in wood formation. Our results suggest that PtBRI1.2 plays a crucial role in regulating shoot growth and wood formation by activating BR signalling.
