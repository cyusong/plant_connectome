Plant root systems are essential for the uptake of water and nutrients from soil and are positively correlated to yield in many crops including the sweetpotato, <i>Ipomoea batatas</i> (L.) Lam. Here, we isolated and functionally characterized <i>IbRAP2.4</i>, a novel nuclear-localized gene encoding the AP2/ERF transcription factor, from sweetpotato. <i>IbRAP2.4</i> was responsive to NaCl, PEG8000, ethylene, and Indole 3-acetic acid treatments. As revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and dual luciferase assay, IbRAP2.4 could bind to both DRE and GCC-box elements and acted as a transcription activator. <i>IbRAP2.4</i> overexpression significantly promoted lateral root formation and enhanced the drought tolerance in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, while it inhibited storage root formation in transgenic sweetpotato by comprehensively upregulating lignin biosynthesis pathway genes. Results suggested that <i>IbRAP2.4</i> may be a useful potential target for further molecular breeding of high yielding sweetpotato.
