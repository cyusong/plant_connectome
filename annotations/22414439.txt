In its simplicity and testability, Flor's gene-for-gene hypothesis has been a powerful driver in plant immunity research for decades. Once the molecular underpinnings of gene-for-gene resistance had come into sharper focus, there was a reassessment of Flor's hypothesis and a name change to effector-triggered immunity. As implied by the name change and exemplified by pioneering studies, plant immunity is increasingly described in terms of protein rather than genetic interactions. This progress leads to a reinterpretation of old concepts of pathogen recognition and resistance signaling and, of course, opens up new questions. Here, we provide a brief historical overview of resistance gene function and how a new focus on protein interactions can lead to a deeper understanding of the logic of plant innate immunity signaling.
