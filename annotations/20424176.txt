['20424176', 'The role of sulfite reductase (SiR) in assimilatory reduction of inorganic  sulfate to sulfide has long been regarded as insignificant for control of flux in  this pathway. Two independent Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA insertion lines (sir1-1  and sir1-2), each with an insertion in the promoter region of SiR, were isolated.  sir1-2 seedlings had 14% SiR transcript levels compared with the wild type and  were early seedling lethal. sir1-1 seedlings had 44% SiR transcript levels and  were viable but strongly retarded in growth. In mature leaves of sir1-1 plants,  the levels of SiR transcript, protein, and enzymatic activity ranged between 17  and 28% compared with the wild type. The 28-fold decrease of incorporation of  (35)S label into Cys, glutathione, and protein in sir1-1 showed that the  decreased activity of SiR generated a severe bottleneck in the assimilatory  sulfate reduction pathway. Root sulfate uptake was strongly enhanced, and steady  state levels of most of the sulfur-related metabolites, as well as the expression  of many primary metabolism genes, were changed in leaves of sir1-1. Hexose and  starch contents were decreased, while free amino acids increased. Inorganic  carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur composition was also severely altered, demonstrating  strong perturbations in metabolism that differed markedly from known sulfate  deficiency responses. The results support that SiR is the only gene with this  function in the Arabidopsis genome, that optimal activity of SiR is essential for  normal growth, and that its downregulation causes severe adaptive reactions of  primary and secondary metabolism.', '2010 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.074088', 'Hell']
