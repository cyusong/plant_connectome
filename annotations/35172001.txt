The hormone gibberellin (GA) is crucial for internode elongation in sugarcane. DELLA proteins are critical negative regulators of the GA signaling pathway. ScGAI encodes a DELLA protein that was previously implicated in the regulation of sugarcane culm development. Here, we characterized ScGAI-like (ScGAIL) in sugarcane, which lacked the N-terminal region but was otherwise homologous to ScGAI. ScGAIL differed from ScGAI in its chromosomal location, expression patterns, and cellular localization. Although transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing ScGAIL were insensitive to GAs, GA synthesis was affected in these plants, suggesting that ScGAIL disrupted the GA signaling pathway. After GA treatment, the expression patterns of GA-associated genes differed between ScGAIL-overexpressing and wild-type Arabidopsis, and the degradation of AtDELLA proteins in transgenic lines was significantly inhibited compared with wild-type lines. A sugarcane GID1 gene (ScGID1) encoding a putative GA receptor was isolated and interacted with ScGAIL in a GA-independent manner. Five ScGAIL-interacting proteins were verified by yeast two-hybrid assays, and only one interacted with ScGAI. Therefore, ScGAIL may inhibit plant growth by modulating the GA signaling pathway.
