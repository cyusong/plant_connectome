['16928780', "SU(VAR)3-9 proteins are key regulators of heterochromatin structure and function  in plants, mammals, Drosophila, and yeast. In contrast to animals and fungi,  plants contain numerous Su(var)3-9 homologues (SUVH), the members of which form a  discrete subfamily. The SU(VAR)3-9 and SUVH proteins associate with  heterochromatin and possess histone methyltransferase activity, indicating that  they participate in the organization of transcriptionally repressive chromatin.  The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 10 SUVH genes, belonging to four  phylogenetically distinct subgroups: SUVH1, SUVH2, SUVH4, and SUVH5. The  structure and expression of SUVH3, a member of the SUVH1 subgroup was  investigated. SUVH3 was shown to be broadly expressed during plant development  with the highest levels found in proliferating cells. The encoded protein  localized in subnuclear foci and remained associated with condensed chromosomes  throughout mitosis. A deletion analysis of the SUVH3 upstream region further  revealed that an intron located in the 5' UTR is a key regulator of strong and  constitutive SUVH3 expression.", '2006', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erl093', 'Kavanagh']
