['29691313', 'Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) is a phosphate donor and energy source. Many  metabolic reactions that generate PPi are suppressed by high levels of PPi. Here,  we investigated how proper levels of cytosolic PPi are maintained, focusing on  soluble pyrophosphatases (AtPPa1 to AtPPa5; hereafter PPa1 to PPa5) and vacuolar  H(+)-pyrophosphatase (H(+)-PPase, AtVHP1/FUGU5) in Arabidopsis thaliana In  planta, five PPa isozymes tagged with GFP were detected in the cytosol and  nuclei. Immunochemical analyses revealed a high abundance of PPa1 and the absence  of PPa3 in vegetative tissue. In addition, the heterologous expression of each  PPa restored growth in a soluble PPase-defective yeast strain. Although the  quadruple knockout mutant plant ppa1 ppa2 ppa4 ppa5 showed no obvious phenotypes,  H(+)-PPase and PPa1 double mutants (fugu5 ppa1) exhibited significant phenotypes,  including dwarfism, high PPi concentrations, ectopic starch accumulation,  decreased cellulose and callose levels, and structural cell wall defects. Altered  cell arrangements and weakened cell walls in the root tip were particularly  evident in fugu5 ppa1 and were more severe than in fugu5 Our results indicate  that H(+)-PPase is essential for maintaining adequate PPi levels and that the  cytosolic PPa isozymes, particularly PPa1, prevent increases in PPi  concentrations to toxic levels. We discuss fugu5 ppa1 phenotypes in relation to  metabolic reactions and PPi homeostasis.', '2018 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00911', 'ORCID:']
