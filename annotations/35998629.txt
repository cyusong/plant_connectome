The extracellular pH is a vital regulator of various biological processes in plants. However, how plants perceive extracellular pH remains obscure. Here, we report that plant cell-surface peptide-receptor complexes can function as extracellular pH sensors. We found that pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) dramatically alkalinizes the acidic extracellular pH in root apical meristem (RAM) region, which is essential for root meristem growth factor 1 (RGF1)-mediated RAM growth. The extracellular alkalinization progressively inhibits the acidic-dependent interaction between RGF1 and its receptors (RGFRs) through the pH sensor sulfotyrosine. Conversely, extracellular alkalinization promotes the alkaline-dependent binding of plant elicitor peptides (Peps) to its receptors (PEPRs) through the pH sensor Glu/Asp, thereby promoting immunity. A domain swap between RGFR and PEPR switches the pH dependency of RAM growth. Thus, our results reveal a mechanism of extracellular pH sensing by plant peptide-receptor complexes and provide insights into the extracellular pH-mediated regulation of growth and immunity in the RAM.
