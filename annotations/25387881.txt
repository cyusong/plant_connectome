['25387881', 'Chromatin is a major determinant in the regulation of virtually all DNA-dependent  processes. Chromatin architectural proteins interact with nucleosomes to modulate  chromatin accessibility and higher-order chromatin structure. The evolutionarily  conserved DEK domain-containing protein is implicated in important  chromatin-related processes in animals, but little is known about its DNA targets  and protein interaction partners. In plants, the role of DEK has remained  elusive. In this work, we identified DEK3 as a chromatin-associated protein in  Arabidopsis thaliana. DEK3 specifically binds histones H3 and H4. Purification of  other proteins associated with nuclear DEK3 also established DNA topoisomerase 1alpha  and proteins of the cohesion complex as in vivo interaction partners. Genome-wide  mapping of DEK3 binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep  sequencing revealed enrichment of DEK3 at protein-coding genes throughout the  genome. Using DEK3 knockout and overexpressor lines, we show that DEK3 affects  nucleosome occupancy and chromatin accessibility and modulates the expression of  DEK3 target genes. Furthermore, functional levels of DEK3 are crucial for stress  tolerance. Overall, data indicate that DEK3 contributes to modulation of  Arabidopsis chromatin structure and function.', '2014 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.129254', 'Jonak']
