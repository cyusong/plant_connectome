Arabidopsis MAP KINASE17 (MPK17) was recently identified as a novel regulator of peroxisome division in response to salt stress. Further, the known peroxisome division factor PEROXISOME AND MITOCHONDRIAL DIVISION FACTOR1 (PMD1) genetically acts downstream of MPK17. We previously showed that mutants defective in either MPK17 or PMD1 fail to proliferate peroxisomes in response to NaCl stress. Here, we show that, unlike their abnormal NaCl responses, mpk17 and pmd1 mutants display wild type responses to other stresses known to alter peroxisome proliferation, suggesting that plants distinguish among peroxisome division-inducing stresses and alter the peroxisome division pathway based on the stress applied.
