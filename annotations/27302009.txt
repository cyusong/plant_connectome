Ureides are nitrogenous compounds derived from purine catabolism which contribute to nitrogen recycling in plants. Accumulation of ureide compounds has been reported in a number of plant species under stress conditions, suggesting their involvement in plants' response to stress. In this research a biochemical and molecular approach was applied to address the ureide accumulation under abiotic stress conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana. Ureide concentration and changes in expression of ureide metabolic genes were examined in response to drought, NaCl and mannitol treatments. Additionally, an Arabidopsis allantoinase (ALN) mutant with constitutive accumulation of a ureide compound, allantoin, was used to investigate the impact of high levels of this compound on drought and NaCl stress responses. In the leaf tissue of adult plants allantoin accumulated in response to soil drying. Transcription of urate oxidase (UO), involved in allantoin production, was highly up-regulated under the same conditions. Allantoin and allantoate also accumulated in seedlings following treatment with NaCl or mannitol. aln mutants with enhanced levels of allantoin exhibited higher tolerance to drought and NaCl. Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide did not accumulate in the aln mutant leaves to the same degree in response to drought when compared to the wild-type. Our results suggest that ureide metabolism and accumulation contribute to the abiotic stress response which is regulated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. Higher concentrations of allantoin in the mutant elevates abiotic stress tolerance, possibly by reducing oxidative damage.

UO: !up-regulates! allantoin
allantoin: !enhances! abiotic stress tolerance
aln mutant: !accumulates! allantoin
allantoin: !reduces! oxidative damage
