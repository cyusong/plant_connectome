['9560288', 'In Arabidopsis thaliana, signal transduction of the hormone ethylene involves at  least two receptors, ETR1 and ERS, both of which are members of the two-component  histidine protein kinase family that is prevalent in prokaryotes. The pathway  also contains a negative regulator of ethylene responses, CTR1, which closely  resembles members of the Raf protein kinase family. CTR1 is thought to act at or  downstream of ETR1 and ERS based on double mutant analysis; however, the  signaling mechanisms leading from ethylene perception to the regulation of CTR1  are unknown. By using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we detected a specific  interaction between the CTR1 amino-terminal domain and the predicted histidine  kinase domain of ETR1 and ERS. We subsequently verified these interactions by  using an in vitro protein association assay(s). In addition, we determined that  the amino-terminal domain of CTR1 can associate with the predicted receiver  domain of ETR1 in vitro. Based on deletion analysis, the portion of CTR1 that  interacts with ETR1 roughly aligns with the regulatory region of Raf kinases.  These physical associations support the genetic evidence that CTR1 acts in the  pathway of ETR1 and ERS and suggest that these interactions could be involved in  the regulation of CTR1 activity.', '1998 Apr 28', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.95.9.5401', 'Chang']
