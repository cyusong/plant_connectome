['21828289', 'The root stem cell niche defines the area that specifies and maintains the stem  cells and is essential for the maintenance of root growth. Here, we characterize  and examine the functional role of a quiescent center (QC)-expressed RAC/ROP  GTPase activator, RopGEF7, in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that RopGEF7  interacts with At RAC1 and overexpression of a C-terminally truncated  constitutively active RopGEF7 (RopGEF7DeltaC) activates RAC/ROP GTPases. Knockdown of  RopGEF7 by RNA interference causes defects in embryo patterning and maintenance  of the QC and leads to postembryonic loss of root stem cell population. Gene  expression studies indicate that RopGEF7 is required for root meristem  maintenance as it regulates the expression of PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2, which  are key transcription factors that mediate the patterning of the root stem cell  niche. Genetic analyses show that RopGEF7 interacts with PLT genes to regulate QC  maintenance. Moreover, RopGEF7 is induced transcriptionally by auxin while its  function is required for the expression of the auxin efflux protein PIN1 and  maintenance of normal auxin maxima in embryos and seedling roots. These results  suggest that RopGEF7 may integrate auxin-derived positional information in a  feed-forward mechanism, regulating PLT transcription factors and thereby  controlling the maintenance of root stem cell niches.', '2011 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.085514', 'Tao']
