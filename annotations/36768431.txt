Extensive research has been conducted for decades to elucidate the molecular and regulatory mechanisms for phytochrome-mediated light signaling in plants. As a result, tens of downstream signaling components that physically interact with phytochromes are identified, among which negative transcription factors for photomorphogenesis, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs), are well known to be regulated by phytochromes. In addition, phytochromes are also shown to inactivate an important E3 ligase complex consisting of CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and SUPPRESSORs OF <i>phyA-105</i> (SPAs). This inactivation induces the accumulation of positive transcription factors for plant photomorphogenesis, such as ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5). Although many downstream components of phytochrome signaling have been studied thus far, it is not fully elucidated which intrinsic activity of phytochromes is necessary for the regulation of these components. It should be noted that phytochromes are autophosphorylating protein kinases. Recently, the protein kinase activity of phytochrome A (phyA) has shown to be important for its function in plant light signaling using <i>Avena sativa</i> phyA mutants with reduced or increased kinase activity. In this review, we highlight the function of phyA as a protein kinase to explain the regulation of plant photoresponses by phyA.
