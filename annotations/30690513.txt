Studies have indicated that the carbon starvation response leads to the reprogramming of the transcriptome and metabolome, and many genes, including several important regulators, such as the group S1 basic leucine zipper transcription factors (TFs) bZIP1, bZIP11 and bZIP53, the SNAC-A TF ATAF1, etc., are involved in these physiological processes. Here, we show that the SNAC-A TF ANAC032 also plays important roles in this process. The overexpression of ANAC032 inhibits photosynthesis and induces reactive oxygen species accumulation in chloroplasts, thereby reducing sugar accumulation and resulting in carbon starvation. ANAC032 reprograms carbon and nitrogen metabolism by increasing sugar and amino acid catabolism in plants. The ChIP-qPCR and transient dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that ANAC032 regulates trehalose metabolism via the direct regulation of TRE1 expression. Taken together, these results show that ANAC032 is an important regulator of the carbon/energy status that represses photosynthesis to induce carbon starvation.
