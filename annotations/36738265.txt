Biological membranes are highly dynamic, in particular due to the constant exchange of vesicles between the different compartments of the cell. In addition, the dynamic nature of membranes is also caused by their inherently fluid properties, with the diffusion of both proteins and lipids within their leaflets. Lipid diffusion is particularly difficult to study in vivo but recent advances in optical microscopy and lipid visualization now enable the characterization of lipid lateral motion, and here we review these methods in plants. We then discuss the parameters that affect lipid diffusion in membranes and explore their consequences on the formation of membrane domains at different scales. Finally, we consider how controlled lipid diffusion affects membrane functions during cell signaling, development, and environmental interactions.
