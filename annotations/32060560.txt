Deschampsia antarctica has managed to colonize the maritime Antarctic. One of the main factors associated with its tolerance to low temperatures is the presence of apoplastic proteins with antifreeze activity. This work focuses on the effect of cold acclimation of D. antarctica on the accumulation of apoplastic proteins with antifreeze activity. Antifreeze proteins present in apoplastic extracts were purified by ice affinity purification, and their identity was determined by protein sequencing. D. antarctica plants were subjected to 22 days of cold acclimation at 4 °C. The highest content of apoplastic proteins with antifreeze activity was obtained at between 12 and 16 days of acclimation. Protein sequencing allowed their identification with >95% probability. Percentage coverage was 74% with D. antarctica ice recrystallization inhibition protein 1 (DaIRIP1) and 55% with DaIRIP3. Cold acclimation of D. antarctica improved the yield of apoplastic proteins, and resulted in an increase in the antifreeze activity of apoplastic extracts. An in silico analysis suggested that the fluctuations presented by the three-dimensional structures of DaIRIPs help to explain the presence of certain DaIRIPs in apoplastic extracts under the cold acclimation conditions evaluated.
