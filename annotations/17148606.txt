['17148606', 'Pathogenic bacterial effectors suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern  (PAMP)-triggered host immunity, thereby promoting parasitism. In the presence of  cognate resistance genes, it is proposed that plants detect the virulence  activity of bacterial effectors and trigger a defense response, referred to here  as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). However, the link between effector  virulence and ETI at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we show that the  Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrB suppresses PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI)  through RAR1, a co-chaperone of HSP90 required for ETI. AvrB expressed in plants  lacking the cognate resistance gene RPM1 suppresses cell wall defense induced by  the flagellar peptide flg22, a well known PAMP, and promotes the growth of  nonpathogenic bacteria in a RAR1-dependent manner. rar1 mutants display enhanced  cell wall defense in response to flg22, indicating that RAR1 negatively regulates  PTI. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RAR1 and AvrB  interact in the plant. The results demonstrate that RAR1 molecularly links PTI,  effector virulence, and ETI. The study supports that both pathogen virulence and  plant disease resistance have evolved around PTI.', '2006 Dec 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0607279103', 'Zhou']
