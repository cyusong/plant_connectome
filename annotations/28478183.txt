['28478183', 'Overexpression of AtPAP2, a phosphatase located on the outer membranes of  chloroplasts and mitochondria, leads to higher energy outputs from these  organelles. AtPAP2 interacts with seven MORF proteins of the editosome complex.  RNA-sequencing analysis showed that the editing degrees of most sites did not  differ significantly between OE and WT, except some sites on the transcripts of  several cytochrome c maturation (Ccm) genes. Western blotting of 2D BN-PAGE  showed that the patterns of CcmF(N1) polypeptides were different between the  lines. We proposed that AtPAP2 may influence cytochrome c biogenesis by  modulating RNA editing through its interaction with MORF proteins.', '2017 Jul', 'Mitochondrion', '10.1016/j.mito.2017.04.006', 'Lim']
