<i>BT4</i> gene was identified to play an important role in <i>Arabidopsis</i> resistance to <i>pst</i> DC3000 in preliminary studies. However, the specific function and molecular mechanism of <i>BT4</i> gene in regulation of <i>Arabidopsis</i> resistance to <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> had not been described to date. In this study, we found that the expression of <i>BT4</i> was induced by wounding and <i>B. cinerea</i> inoculation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. After inoculated with <i>B. cinerea</i>, T-DNA insertion mutants of the <i>BT4</i> gene, <i>bt4</i>, showed significant susceptibility symptoms, whereas no significant symptoms were found in wild-type (WT), the complemented transgenic plants (CE), and the overexpression transgenic plants (OE). After inoculated with <i>B. cinerea</i>, the expression levels of <i>JAR1</i> and <i>PDF1.2</i> genes in <i>bt4</i> mutant were induced; however, the expression levels of these genes in <i>bt4</i> mutant were significantly lower than those in the WT, CE, and OE. These results indicated that the <i>BT4</i> positively regulate the expression of genes in JA/ET signaling pathways. Therefore, the <i>BT4</i> may be involved in the regulation of JA/ET signaling pathways to affect <i>Arabidopsis</i> resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i>.
