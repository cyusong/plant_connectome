Stomatal density is an important factor that determines the efficiency of plant gas exchange and water transpiration. Through forward genetics, we screened a mutant <i>rice stomata developmental defect 1</i> (<i>rsd1-1</i>) with decreased stomatal density and clustered stomata in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). After the first asymmetric division, some of the larger sister cells undergo an extra asymmetric division to produce a small cell neighboring guard mother cell. Some of these small cells develop into stomata, which leads to stomatal clustering, and the rest arrested or developed into pavement cell. After map-based cloning, we found the protein encoded by this gene containing DUF630 and DUF632 domains. Evolutionary analysis showed that the <i>DUF630/632</i> gene family differentiated earlier in land plants. It was found that the deletion of <i>RSD1</i> would lead to the disorder of gene expression regarding stomatal development, especially the expression of <i>stomatal density and distribution 1</i> (<i>OsSDD1</i>). Through the construction of <i>OsSDD1</i> deletion mutants by CRISPR-Cas9, we found that, similar to <i>rsd1</i> mutants, the <i>ossdd1</i> mutants have clustered stomata and extra small cells adjacent to the stomata. <i>OsSDD1</i> and <i>RSD1</i> are both required for inhibiting ectopic asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) and clustered stomata. By dehydration stress assay, the decreased stomatal density of <i>rsd1</i> mutants enhanced their dehydration avoidance. This study characterized the functions of <i>RSD1</i> and <i>OsSDD1</i> in rice stomatal development. Our findings will be helpful in developing drought-resistant crops through controlling the stomatal density.
