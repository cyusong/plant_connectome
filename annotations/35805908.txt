Nitric oxide (NO) is a widely distributed gaseous signaling molecule in plants that can be synthesized through enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways and plays an important role in plant growth and development, signal transduction, and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal pollutant widely found in the environment, which not only inhibits plant growth but also enters humans through the food chain and endangers human health. To reduce or avoid the adverse effects of Cd stress, plants have evolved a range of coping mechanisms. Many studies have shown that NO is also involved in the plant response to Cd stress and plays an important role in regulating the resistance of plants to Cd stress. However, until now, the mechanisms by which Cd stress regulates the level of endogenous NO accumulation in plant cells remained unclear, and the role of exogenous NO in plant responses to Cd stress is controversial. This review describes the pathways of NO production in plants, the changes in endogenous NO levels in plants under Cd stress, and the effects of exogenous NO on regulating plant resistance to Cd stress.
