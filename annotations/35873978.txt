Winter wheat cultivar Pindong 34 has both adult-plant resistance (APR) and all-stage resistance (ASR) to stripe rust, which is caused by <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>). To map the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for stripe rust resistance, an F<sub>6-10</sub> recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a cross of Mingxian 169 × Pingdong 34 was phenotyped for stripe rust response over multiple years in fields under natural infection conditions and with selected <i>Pst</i> races under controlled greenhouse conditions, and genotyping was performed with a 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array chip. Inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) identified 12 APR resistance QTLs and 3 ASR resistance QTLs. Among the 12 APR resistance QTLs, <i>QYrpd.swust-1BL</i> (explaining 9.24-13.33% of the phenotypic variation), <i>QYrpd.swust-3AL.1</i> (11.41-14.80%), <i>QYrpd.swust</i>-<i>3AL.2</i> (11.55-16.10%), <i>QYrpd.swust-6BL</i> (9.39-12.78%), <i>QYrpd.swust-6DL</i> (9.52-16.36%), <i>QYrpd.swust-7AL</i> (9.09-17.0%), and <i>QYrpd.swust-7DL</i> (8.87-11.38%) were more abundant than in the five tested environments and <i>QYrpd.swust-1AS</i> (11.05-12.72%), <i>QYrpd.swust-1DL</i> (9.81-13.05%), <i>QYrpd.swust-2BL.1</i> (9.69-10.57%), <i>QYrpd.swust-2BL.2</i> (10.36-12.97%), and <i>QYrpd.swust-2BL.3</i> (9.54-13.15%) were significant in some of the tests. The three ASR resistance QTLs <i>QYrpd.swust-2AS</i> (9.69-13.58%), <i>QYrpd.swust-2BL.4</i> (9.49-12.07%), and <i>QYrpd.swust-7AS</i> (16.16%) were detected based on the reactions in the seedlings tested with the CYR34 <i>Pst</i> race. Among the 15 QTLs detected in Pindong 34, the ASR resistance gene <i>QYrpd.swust-7AS</i> mapped on the short arm of chromosome 7A was likely similar to the previously reported QTL <i>Yr61</i> in the region. The QTLs identified in the present study and their closely linked molecular markers could be useful for developing wheat cultivars with durable resistance to stripe rust.
