Plants count on a wide variety of metabolic, physiological, and developmental responses to adapt their growth to variations in mineral nutrient availability. To react to such variations plants have evolved complex sensing and signaling mechanisms that allow them to monitor the external and internal concentration of each of these nutrients, both in absolute terms and also relatively to the status of other nutrients. Recent evidence has shown that hormones participate in the control of these regulatory networks. Conversely, mineral nutrient conditions influence hormone biosynthesis, further supporting close interrelation between hormonal stimuli and nutritional homeostasis. In this review, we summarize these evidences and analyze possible transcriptional correlations between hormonal and nutritional responses, as a means to further characterize the role of hormones in the response of plants to limiting nutrients in soil.
