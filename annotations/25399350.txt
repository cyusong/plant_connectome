Continuous light induces a potentially lethal injury in domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants. Recently, continuous-light tolerance was reported in several wild tomato species, yet the molecular mechanisms underpinning tolerance/sensitivity are still elusive. Here, we investigated from which part of the plant continuous-light tolerance originates and whether this trait acts systemically within the plant. By exposing grafted plants bearing both tolerant and sensitive shoots, the trait was functionally located in the shoot rather than the roots. Additionally, an increase in continuous-light tolerance was observed in sensitive plants when a continuous-light-tolerant shoot was grafted on it. Cultivation of greenhouse tomatoes under continuous light promises high yield increases. Our results show that to pursuit this, the trait should be bred into scion rather than rootstock lines. In addition, identifying the nature of the signal/molecule(s) and/or the mechanism of graft-induced, continuous-light tolerance can potentially result in a better understanding of important physiological processes like long-distance signaling.
