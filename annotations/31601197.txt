Post-embryonic growth of land plants originates from meristems. Genetic networks in meristems maintain the stem cells and direct acquisition of cell fates. WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) transcription factors involved in meristem networks have only been functionally characterized in two evolutionarily distant taxa, mosses and seed plants. This report characterizes a WOX gene in a fern, which is located phylogenetically between the two taxa. CrWOXB transcripts were detected in proliferating tissues, including gametophyte and sporophyte meristems of Ceratopteris richardii. In addition, CrWOXB is expressed in archegonia but not the antheridia of gametophytes. Suppression of CrWOXB expression in wild-type RN3 plants by RNAi produced abnormal morphologies of gametophytes and sporophytes. The gametophytes of RNAi lines produced fewer cells, and fewer female gametes compared to wild-type. In the sporophyte generation, RNAi lines produced fewer leaves, pinnae, roots and lateral roots compared to wild-type sporophytes. Our results suggest that CrWOXB functions to promote cell divisions and organ development in the gametophyte and sporophyte generations, respectively. CrWOXB is the first intermediate-clade WOX gene shown to function in both generations in land plants.
