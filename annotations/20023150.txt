['20023150', 'Plants possess many metabolic genes for the production of a wide variety of  phytochemicals in a tissue-specific manner. However, the metabolic systems behind  the diversity and tissue-dependent regulation still remain unknown due to  incomplete characterization of phytochemicals produced in a single plant species.  Thus, having a metabolome dataset in addition to the genome and transcriptome  information resources would enrich our knowledge of plant secondary metabolism.  Here we analyzed phytochemical accumulation during development of the model plant  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  in samples covering many growth stages and organs. We also obtained tandem mass  spectrometry spectral tags of many metabolites as a resource for elucidation of  metabolite structure. These are part of the AtMetExpress metabolite accumulation  atlas. Based on the dataset, we detected 1,589 metabolite signals from which the  structures of 167 metabolites were elucidated. The integrated analyses with  transcriptome data demonstrated that Arabidopsis produces various phytochemicals  in a highly tissue-specific manner, which often accompanies the expression of key  biosynthesis-related genes. We also found that a set of biosynthesis-related  genes is coordinately expressed among the tissues. These data suggested that the  simple mode of regulation, transcript to metabolite, is an origin of the dynamics  and diversity of plant secondary metabolism.', '2010 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.148031', 'Saito']
