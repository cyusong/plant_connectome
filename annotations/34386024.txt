The plant metabolome is considered as a bridge between the genome and the phenome and is essential for the interaction between plant growth and the plant environment. Here, we used the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to perform a widely targeted metabolomics analysis of 150 millet germplasm and simultaneous identification and quantification of 330 annotated metabolites. Comparing the metabolic content of different millets revealed significant natural variation of both primary and secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, phenolamides, hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives, nucleotides, and lipids, in the millets from India and the north and south of China; among them, some of the flavonoids are the most prominent. A total of 2.2 TB sequence data were obtained by sequencing 150 accessions of foxtail millet using the Illumina platform. Further digging into the genetic basis of metabolites by mGWAS analysis found that cyanidin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside and quercetin <i>O</i>-acetylhexside are concentratedly located at 43.55 Mb on chromosome 5 and 26.9 Mb on chromosome 7, and two Lc were mined as candidate genes, respectively. However, the signals of luteolin 7-<i>O</i>-glucoside and kaempferol 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside were also detected at 14.36 Mb on chromosome 3, and five glycosyltransferase genes on this loci were deemed to regulate their content. Our work is the first research to use mGWAS in millet, and it paves the way for future dissection of complex physiological traits in millet.
