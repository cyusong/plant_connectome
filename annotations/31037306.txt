Terpenoids, the biggest class of plant secondary metabolites, have a wide range of significant physiological roles, while many of them are important natural drugs. Biosynthesis of pharmaceutical terpenoids in plants is a fairly complex process, most of which involves cytochrome P450 (CYP450) monooxygenases. CYP450 enzymes are versatile biocatalysts that play critical roles in terpenoid skeleton modification and structural diversity. Therefore, the discovery and identification of CYP450 genes is significant for elucidating the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. This review summarizes the progress and cloning strategies relating to CYP450s in pharmaceutical terpenoid biosynthesis of the past decade.
