['11976332', '4-Hydroxyproline is found in collagens and collagen-like proteins in animals and  in many glycoproteins in plants. Animal prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) have been  cloned and characterized from many sources, but no plant P4H has been cloned so  far. We report here that the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes six P4H-like  polypeptides, one of which, a 283-residue soluble monomer, was cloned and  characterized here as a recombinant protein. Catalytically critical residues  identified in animal P4Hs are conserved in this P4H, and their mutagenesis led to  complete or almost complete inactivation. The recombinant P4H effectively  hydroxylated poly(l-proline) and many synthetic peptides corresponding to  proline-rich repeats present in plant glycoproteins and other proteins.  Surprisingly, collagen-like peptides were also good substrates, the V(max) with  (Pro-Pro-Gly)(10) being similar to that with poly(l-proline). The enzyme acted in  this peptide preferentially on prolines in Y positions in the X-Y-Gly triplets.  Correspondingly, (Gly-Pro-4Hyp)(5) and (Pro-Ala-Gly)(5) were poor substrates,  with V(max) values less than 5 and 20% of that obtained with (Pro-Pro-Gly)(10),  respectively, the K(m) for the latter also being high. Peptides representing the  N- and C-terminal hydroxylation sites present in hypoxia-inducible transcription  factor alpha also served as substrates. As these peptides contain only one  proline residue, a poly(l-proline) type II conformation was clearly not required  for hydroxylation.', '2002 Jun 28', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M201865200', 'Myllyharju']
