Diel root extension was observed for Serianthes grandiflora, Serianthes kanehirae, and Serianthes nelsonii plants ranging in size from seedlings to 2-m tall saplings. The percentage of daily root extension that occurred at night declined from 65% for seedlings to 51% for 200-cm tall plants for S. grandiflora, from 58% for seedlings to 54% for 200-cm tall plants for S. kanehirae, and from 72% for seedlings to 55% for 200-cm tall plants for S. nelsonii. These results indicate the timing of root extension rates throughout a diel cycle may be included in the list of phenology and physiology traits that change as plants increase in size.
