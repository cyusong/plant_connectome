Two essential residues playing critical roles in determining the substrate specificities of cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1) have been identified from the alignment of high-affinity (GLN1;1 and GLN1;4) and low-affinity (GLN1;2 and GLN1;3) GS1 isoenzymes in Arabidopsis, and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. The results indicated that either K49Q or A174S mutation is sufficient to increase the catalytic efficiencies of GLN1;3 by decreasing its Km values for ammonium. In contrast, replacement of Gln49 and Ser174 by lysine and alanine, respectively, was detrimental to glutamine synthetic activities in GLN1;4. The results suggested that Gln49 and Ser174 in the high-affinity GS1 isoenzymes are interchangeable with Lys49 and Ala174 in the low-affinity variants at the corresponding positions.

K49Q: !increases! catalytic efficiency 
A174S: !increases! catalytic efficiency 
Gln49: !interchangeable with! Lys49 
Ser174: !interchangeable with! Ala174
