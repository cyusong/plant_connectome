Flower shapes, colors, sizes and fragrances are shaped mostly for pollinator attraction. Flower phenotypes are, however, subjected to conflicting selection directed by both pollinators and non-pollinating agents. We investigated flower attractiveness to a model pollinator in the snowdrop (<i>Galanthus nivalis</i> L.) under laboratory conditions. Naïve bumblebees (<i>Bombus terrestris</i> L.) showed strong, innate preferences for experimentally altered upward positioned flowers, suggesting that the natural, downward orientation did not evolve to attract pollinators. Experimentally treated green marks on inner tepals decreased pollinator attraction compared with flowers expressing intact marks, suggesting that green marks serve to guide/attract pollinators. Attractiveness of green marks was significantly compromised by flower orientation; green marks were attractive only for untreated downward-oriented flowers, but they did not improve the attractiveness of upward-oriented flowers. Our results suggest that downward flowers in snowdrop evolved under conflicting selection directed by biotic and abiotic factors, and that green marks on inner tepals could evolve later to enhance flower attractiveness.
