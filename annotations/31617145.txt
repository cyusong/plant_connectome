MMDH2 gene negatively regulates Cd tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the ROS-mediated signaling, thus, affecting the expression of PDR8. The molecular mechanism by which plants respond to stress caused by cadmium (Cd), one of the most toxic heavy metals to plants, is not well understood. Here, we show that MMDH2, a gene encoding mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, is involved in Cd stress tolerance in Arabidopsis. The expression of MMDH2 was repressed by Cd stress. The mmdh2 knockdown mutants showed enhanced Cd tolerance, while the MMDH2-overexpressing lines were sensitive to Cd. Under normal and Cd stress conditions, lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were detected in mmdh2 mutant plants than in wild-type plants. In contrast, higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were found in MMDH2-overexpressing lines, and they were negatively correlated with malondialdehyde levels. In addition, the expression of the PDR8, a gene encoding a Cd efflux pump, increased and decreased in the mmdh2 mutant and MMDH2-overexpressing lines, in association with lower and higher Cd concentrations, respectively. These results suggest that the MMDH2 gene negatively regulates Cd tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the ROS-mediated signaling, thus, affecting the expression of PDR8.
