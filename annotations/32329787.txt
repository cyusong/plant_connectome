['32329787', "A homolog of the mitochondrial succinate/fumarate carrier from yeast (Sfc1p) has  been found in the Arabidopsis genome, named AtSFC1. The AtSFC1 gene was expressed  in Escherichia coli, and the gene product was purified and reconstituted in  liposomes. Its transport properties and kinetic parameters demonstrated that  AtSFC1 transports citrate, isocitrate and aconitate and, to a lesser extent,  succinate and fumarate. This carrier catalyzes a fast counter-exchange transport  as well as a low uniport of substrates, exhibits a higher transport affinity for  tricarboxylates than dicarboxylates, and is inhibited by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate  and other inhibitors of mitochondrial carriers to various degrees. Gene  expression analysis indicated that the AtSFC1 transcript is mainly present in  heterotrophic tissues, and fusion with a green-fluorescent protein localized  AtSFC1 to the mitochondria. Furthermore, 35S-AtSFC1 antisense lines were  generated and characterized at metabolic and physiological levels in different  organs and at various developmental stages. Lower expression of AtSFC1 reduced  seed germination and impaired radicle growth, a phenotype that was related to  reduced respiration rate. These findings demonstrate that AtSFC1 might be  involved in storage oil mobilization at the early stages of seedling growth and  in nitrogen assimilation in root tissue by catalyzing citrate/isocitrate or  citrate/succinate exchanges.", '2020 May 15', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BCJ20190785', 'Nunes-Nesi']
