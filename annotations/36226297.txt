Systematic genome-wide analysis of <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> revealed the identification of a total of 48 homologous genes comprising 21 proline-rich proteins (<i>PRPs</i>) and 27 hybrid proline-rich proteins (<i>HyPRPs</i>). Comprehensive scrutiny of these gene homologs was conducted for gene structure, phylogenetic investigations, chromosome mapping, and subcellular localization of proteins. Promoter analysis uncovered the regions rich with phosphorous- (BIHD), ammonium-, sulfur-responsive (SURE), and iron starvation-responsive (IRO2) along with biotic, abiotic, and development-specific <i>cis</i>-elements. Further, PRPs exhibit more methylation and acetylation sites in comparison with HyPRPs. miRNAs have been predicted which might play a role in cleavage and translation inhibition. Several of the <i>SbPRP</i> genes were stimulated in a tissue-specific manner under drought, salt, heat, and cold stresses. Additionally, exposure of plants to abscisic acid (ABA) and zinc (Zn) also triggered PRP genes in a tissue-dependent way. Among them, <i>SbPRP17</i> has been found upregulated markedly in all tissues irrespective of the stress imposed. The expressions of <i>SbHyPRPs</i>, especially <i>SbHyPRP2</i>, <i>SbHyPRP6</i>, and <i>SbHyPRP17</i> were activated under all stresses in all three tissues. On the other hand, <i>SbHyPRP8</i> (root only) and <i>SbHyPRP12</i> (all three tissues) were highly responsive to cold stress and ABA while <i>SbHyPRP26</i> was induced by drought and Zn in the stem. Taken together, this study indicates the critical roles that <i>SbPRPs</i> and <i>SbHyPRPs</i> play during diverse abiotic stress conditions and notably the plausible roles that these genes play upon exposure to zinc, the crucial micronutrient in plants.
