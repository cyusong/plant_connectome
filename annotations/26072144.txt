Pectin, which is enriched in primary cell walls and middle lamellae, is an essential polysaccharide in all higher plants. Homogalacturonans (HGA), a major form of pectin, are synthesized and methylesterified by enzymes localized in the Golgi apparatus and transported into the cell wall. Depending on cell type, the degree and pattern of pectin methylesterification are strictly regulated by cell wall-localized pectin methylesterases (PMEs). Despite its importance in plant development and growth, little is known about the physiological functions of pectin in rice, which contains 43 different types of PME. The presence of pectin in rice cell walls has been substantiated by uronic acid quantification and immunodetection of JIM7 monoclonal antibodies. We performed PME activity assays with cell wall proteins isolated from different rice tissues. In accordance with data from Arabidopsis, the highest activity was observed in germinating tissues, young culm, and spikelets, where cells are actively elongating. Transcriptional profiling of OsPMEs by real-time PCR and meta-analysis indicates that PMEs exhibit spatial- and stress-specific expression patterns during rice development. Based on in silico analysis, we identified subcellular compartments, isoelectric point, and cleavage sites of OsPMEs. Our findings provide an important tool for further studies seeking to unravel the functional importance of pectin modification during plant growth and abiotic and biotic responses of grass plants.
