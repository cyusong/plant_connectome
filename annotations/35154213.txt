Abscisic acid (ABA) largely promotes leaf senescence and inhibits seed germination in plants. Endogenous ABA content is finely tuned by many transcription factors. In this study, we showed that <i>OsWRKY53</i> is a positive regulator of leaf senescence and a negative regulator of seed germination in rice. <i>OsWRKY53</i> expression was induced in leaves under aging, dark, and ABA treatment. The <i>OsWRKY53</i>-overexpressing (<i>OsWRKY53</i>-oe) plants showed early yellowing leaves, while the <i>OsWRKY53</i> (<i>oswrky53</i>) knockout mutants maintained green leaves than the wild type under natural, dark-induced, and ABA-induced senescence conditions. Transcriptional analysis revealed that ABA catabolic genes, namely, <i>OsABA8ox1</i> and <i>OsABA8ox2</i>, two key genes participating in ABA catabolism harboring ABA 8'-hydroxylase activity, were markedly downregulated in <i>OsWRKY53</i>-oe leaves. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and protoplast transient assays revealed that OsWRKY53 directly bound to the promoters of <i>OsABA8ox1</i> and <i>OsABA8ox2</i> to repress their transcription, resulting in elevated endogenous ABA contents that promoted premature leaf senescence in the <i>OsWRKY53</i>-oe plants. It indicates that OsWRKY53 is a positive regulator through regulating ABA accumulation to promote leaf senescence. In addition, accumulated ABA simultaneously inhibited seed germination and post-germination growth in <i>OsWRKY53</i>-oe plants. Taken together, OsWRKY53 suppresses the transcript of ABA catabolic genes to promote ABA accumulation to modulate ABA-induced leaf senescence and ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination.
