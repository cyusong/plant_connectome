The collection and analysis of large amounts of information on a plant-by-plant basis contributes to the development of precision fertigation and may be achieved by combining remote-sensing technology with high-throughput phenotyping methods. Here, lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa) were grown under optimal and suboptimal nitrogen and irrigation treatments from seedlings to harvest. A Plantarray system was used to calculate and log weights, daily transpiration, and momentary transpiration rates throughout the experiment. From 15 d after planting until experiment termination, the entire array of plants was imaged hourly (from 09.00 h to 14.00 h) using a hyperspectral moving camera. Three vegetation indices were calculated from the plants' reflectance signal: red-edge chlorophyll index (RECI), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), and water index (WI), and combined treatments, physiological measurements, and vegetation indices were compared. RECI values differed significantly between nitrogen treatments from the first day of imaging, and WI values distinguished well-irrigated from drought-treated groups before detecting significant differences in daily transpiration rate. The PRI, calculated hourly during the drought-treatment phase, changed with the momentary transpiration rate. Thus, hyperspectral imaging might be used in growing facilities to detect nitrogen or water shortages in plants before their physiological response affects yields.
