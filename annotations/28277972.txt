Plant activators activate systemic acquired resistance-like defense responses or induced systemic resistance, and thus protect plants from pathogens. We screened a chemical library composed of structurally diverse small molecules. We isolated six plant immune-inducing thienopyrimidine-type compounds and their analogous compounds. It was observed that the core structure of thienopyrimidine plays a role in induced resistance in plants. Furthermore, we highlight the protective effect of thienopyrimidine-type compounds against both hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen, Colletotrichum higginsianum, and bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola, in Arabidopsis thaliana. We suggest that thienopyrimidine-type compounds could be potential lead compounds as novel plant activators, and can be useful and effective agrochemicals against various plant diseases.
