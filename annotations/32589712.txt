The nuclear envelope delineates the eukaryotic cell nucleus. The membrane system of the nuclear envelope consists of an outer nuclear membrane and an inner nuclear membrane separated by a perinuclear space. It serves as more than just a static barrier, since it regulates the communication between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm and provides the anchoring points where chromatin is attached. Fewer nuclear envelope proteins have been identified in plants in comparison with animals and yeasts. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of the nuclear envelope in plants, focusing on its role as a chromatin organizer and regulator of gene expression, as well as on the modifications that it undergoes to be efficiently disassembled and reassembled with each cell division. Advances in knowledge concerning the mitotic role of some nuclear envelope constituents are also presented. In addition, we summarize recent progress on the contribution of the nuclear envelope elements to telomere tethering and chromosome dynamics during the meiotic division in different plant species.
