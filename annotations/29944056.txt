Downy mildew disease, caused by the obligate oomycete pathogen Peronospora effusa, is the most important economic constraint for spinach production. Three races (races 12, 13, and 14) of P. effusa have been sequenced and assembled. The draft genomes of these three races have been deposited to GenBank and provide useful resources for dissecting the interaction between the host and the pathogen and may provide a framework for determining the mechanism by which new races of the pathogen are rapidly emerging.
