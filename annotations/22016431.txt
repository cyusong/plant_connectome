Plant growth and development is largely influenced by ubiquitin-mediated regulation of protein stability. Specificity of the ubiquitination pathway is controlled mainly by the substrate-recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligases, and consequently, E3 ligases control numerous cellular processes. Recent evidence that ubiquitination plays a critical role in regulating plant responses to abiotic stresses has launched intensive efforts to identify E3 ligases that mediate plant tolerance of adverse environmental conditions. Most stress-related E3 ligases identified to date facilitate responses to environmental stimuli by modulating the abundance of key downstream stress-responsive transcription factors. In this review, the regulatory roles of ubiquitin during the plant's response to abiotic stress are summarized and highlighted.

E3 ligases: !control! Ubiquitination pathway 
Ubiquitination: !regulates! Plant growth and development 
E3 ligases: !mediate! Plant tolerance of adverse environmental conditions 
E3 ligases: !modulate! Abundance of key downstream stress-responsive transcription factors
