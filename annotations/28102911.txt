['28102911', 'Glutathione peroxidase-like enzymes (GPXLs) constitute a family of eight  peroxidases in Arabidopsis thaliana. In contrast to the eponymous selenocysteine  glutathione peroxidases in mammalian cells that use glutathione as electron  donor, GPXLs rely on cysteine instead of selenocysteine for activity and depend  on the thioredoxin system for reduction. Although plant GPXLs have been  implicated in important agronomic traits such as drought tolerance,  photooxidative tolerance and immune responses, there remain major ambiguities  regarding their subcellular localization. Because their site of action is a  prerequisite for an understanding of their function, we investigated the  localization of all eight GPXLs in stable Arabidopsis lines expressing N-terminal  and C-terminal fusions with redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein 2 (roGFP2)  using confocal microscopy. GPXL1 and GPXL7 were found in plastids, while GPXL2  and GPXL8 are cytosolic nuclear. The N-terminal target peptide of GPXL6 is  sufficient to direct roGFP2 into mitochondria. Interestingly, GPXL3, GPXL4 and  GPXL5 all appear to be membrane bound. GPXL3 was found exclusively in the  secretory pathway where it is anchored by a single N-terminal transmembrane  domain. GPXL4 and GPXL5 are anchored to the plasma membrane. Presence of an  N-terminal myristoylation motif and genetic disruption of membrane association  through targeted mutagenesis point to myristoylation as essential for membrane  localization.', '2017 Aug', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.12919', 'ORCID:']
