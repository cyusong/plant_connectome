Twenty-day-old sunflower plants (Helianthus annuus L. cv Sun-Gro 380) grown hydroponically under controlled conditions were used to study the effect of transpiration on Na(+) compartmentalization in roots. The plants were exposed to low Na(+) concentrations (25 mM NaCl) and different environmental humidity conditions over a short time period (8.5 h). Under these conditions, Na(+) was accumulated primarily in the root, but only the Na(+) accumulated in the root symplast was dependent on transpiration, while the Na(+) accumulated in both the shoot and the root apoplast exhibited a low transpiration dependence. Moreover, Na(+) content in the root apoplast was reached quickly (0.25 h) and increased little with time. These results suggest that, in sunflower plants under moderate salinity conditions, Na(+) uptake in the root symplast is mediated by a transport system whose activity is enhanced by transpiration.
