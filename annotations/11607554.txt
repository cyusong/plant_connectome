['11607554', 'We have employed Arabidopsis thaliana as a model host plant to genetically  dissect the molecular pathways leading to disease resistance. A. thaliana  accession Col-0 is susceptible to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv.  tomato strain DC3000 but resistant in a race-specific manner to DC3000 carrying  any one of the cloned avirulence genes avrB, avrRpm1, avrRpt2, and avrPph3.  Fast-neutron-mutagenized Col-0 M2 seed was screened to identify mutants  susceptible to DC3000(avrB). Disease assays and analysis of in planta bacterial  growth identified one mutant, ndr1-1 (nonrace-specific disease resistance), that  was susceptible to DC3000 expressing any one of the four avirulence genes tested.  Interestingly, a hypersensitive-like response was still induced by several of the  strains. The ndr1-1 mutation also rendered the plant susceptible to several  avirulent isolates of the fungal pathogen Peronospora parasitica. Genetic  analysis of ndr1-1 demonstrated that the mutation segregated as a single  recessive locus, located on chromosome III. Characterization of the ndr1-1  mutation suggests that a common step exists in pathways of resistance to two  unrelated pathogens.', '1995 Jul 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.92.14.6597', 'Staskawicz']
