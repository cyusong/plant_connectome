['29616060', 'The function of human Golgi antiapoptotic proteins (GAAPs) resembles that of BAX  inhibitor-1, with apoptosis inhibition triggered by intrinsic and extrinsic  stimuli. However, little is known about the function of GAAP-related proteins in  plants. Here, we studied Arabidopsis GAAP1 and GAAP3 and found that they were  localized on the cellular membrane, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  membrane. The function of GAAP1/GAAP3 in ER-stress response was tested, and  results showed that single or double mutation in GAAP1 and GAAP3 reduced plant  survival and enhanced cell death under ER stress. The expression of both genes  was induced by various abiotic stress signals. Quantitative real-time polymerase  chain reaction analysis showed that GAAP1/GAAP3 level affected the expression  pattern of the unfolded-protein response (UPR) signaling pathway genes upon  prolonged ER stress. The mutation in both GAAP1 and GAAP3 genes promoted and  enhanced UPR signaling when confronted with mild ER stress. Moreover, GAAP1/GAAP3  inhibited cell death caused by ER stress and promoted plant-growth recovery by  turning down inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) signaling after ER stress had  been relieved. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-Ip) and BiFC assays showed that  GAAP1/GAAP3 interacted with IRE1. These data suggested that GAAP1/GAAP3 played  dual roles in the negative regulation of IRE1 activity and anti-programmed cell  death.', '2018', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2018.00348', 'Li']
