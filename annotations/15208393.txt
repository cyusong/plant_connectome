['15208393', 'Reversible protein phosphorylation regulates many cellular processes, including  the dynamics and organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, but the events  mediating it are poorly understood. A semidominant phs1-1 allele of the  Arabidopsis thaliana PROPYZAMIDE-HYPERSENSITIVE 1 locus exhibits phenotypes  indicative of compromised cortical microtubule functions, such as left-handed  helical growth of seedling roots, defective anisotropic growth at low doses of  microtubule-destabilizing drugs, enhancement of the temperature-sensitive  microtubule organization1-1 phenotype, and less ordered and more fragmented  cortical microtubule arrays compared with the wild type. PHS1 encodes a novel  protein similar to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatases. In  phs1-1, a conserved Arg residue in the noncatalytic N-terminal region is  exchanged with Cys, and the mutant PHS1 retained considerable phosphatase  activity in vitro. In mammalian MAPK phosphatases, the corresponding region  serves as a docking motif for MAPKs, and analogous Arg substitutions severely  inhibit the kinase-phosphatase association. Transgenic studies indicate that the  phs1-1 mutation acts dominant negatively, whereas the null phs1-2 allele is  recessive embryonic lethal. We propose that the PHS1 phosphatase regulates more  than one MAPK and that a subset of its target kinases is involved in the  organization of cortical microtubules.', '2004 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.021865', 'Hashimoto']
