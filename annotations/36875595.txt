The Mediterranean Basin is one of the most biodiverse areas in the world, harboring 25,000 plant species, of which 60% are endemic. Some of them have narrow distributions, such as <i>Euphorbia orphanidis</i>, which is only known from alpine screes on Mt. Parnassos in Greece. Its exact distribution in this mountain was, however, poorly known, and its phylogenetic origin was also unclear. We performed extensive field work in Mt. Parnassos and could register <i>E. orphanidis</i> only in five patches of limestone screes in the eastern part of this mountain range, emphasizing its very narrow distribution, which is likely limited by topography influencing water availability as indicated by environmental modeling. We also registered 31 accompanying species and thus characterized its habitat. Using nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer and plastid <i>ndhF-trnL</i> and <i>trnT-trnF</i> sequences, we show that it belongs to <i>E.</i> sect. <i>Patellares</i>, despite not having connate raylet leaves typical for this section, and not to <i>E.</i> sect. <i>Pithyusa</i> as previously suggested. The relationships among the species of <i>E.</i> sect. <i>Patellares</i> are poorly resolved, suggesting their simultaneous divergence that dated to the late Pliocene, which coincided with the establishment of the Mediterranean climate. The relative genome size of <i>E. orphanidis</i> is in the range of that for the other members of <i>E.</i> sect. <i>Patellares</i>, suggesting that it is diploid. Finally, we performed multivariate morphological analyses to generate a comprehensive description of <i>E. orphanidis</i>. Based on its narrow distribution and the anticipated negative impact of global warming, we consider this species endangered. Our study demonstrates how microrelief can limit the distribution of plants in topographically heterogeneous mountain environments and likely plays an important, yet neglected, role in shaping the distribution patterns of plants in the Mediterranean Basin.
