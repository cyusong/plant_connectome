Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are spherical endosomal organelles containing small vesicles formed by inward budding of the limiting membrane into the endosomal lumen. In mammalian red cells and cells of immune system, MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane in an exocytic manner, leading to release their contents including internal vesicles into the extracellular space. These released vesicles are termed exosomes. Transmission electron microscopy studies have shown that paramural vesicles situated between the plasma membrane and the cell wall occur in various cell wall-associated processes and are similar to exosomes both in location and in morphology. Our recent studies have revealed that MVBs and paramural vesicles proliferate when cell wall appositions are rapidly deposited beneath fungal penetration attempts or during plugging of plasmodesmata between hypersensitive cells and their intact neighboring cells. This indicates a potential secretion of exosome-like vesicles into the extracellular space by fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane. This MVB-mediated secretion pathway was proposed on the basis of pioneer studies of MVBs and paramural vesicles in plants some forty years ago. Here, we recall the attention to the occurrence of MVB-mediated secretion of exosomes in plants.
