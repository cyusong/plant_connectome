Stomata not only control the important balance between gaseous fluxes and water loss, but also act as a route of invading pathogen entry into the plant. Here, the stomatal opening was observed to be induced by a necrotrophic pathogen <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> at the early stages of infection. In contrast to uninfected control, the stomatal pores were still opened in <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>-infected regions after dark adaption. Mutation of violaxanthin de-epoxidase, a key enzyme in the xanthophyll cycle, could partially restore the <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>-induced stomatal opening. Further studies showed that <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> invasion led to a decrease in electron transport rate, but a significant increase in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The decay kinetics of NPQ revealed that zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP, also known as ABA1) was continuous deactivation in <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>-infected region. HPLC-MS/MS analysis showed a slight increase of jasmonate acid (JA), but a great decrease of abscisic acid (ABA) content in <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>-inoculated tissue. Exogenous application of ABA but not JA could rescue the abnormal stomatal opening. Together, these results suggested that the <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>-induced decrease of ABA biosynthesis reduced stomatal closing via dysfunction of the xanthophyll cycle during early pathogenesis.
