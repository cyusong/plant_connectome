The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), as a part of the MAPKKK-MAPKK-MAPK cascade, play crucial roles in plant development as an intracellular signal transduction pathway to respond various environmental signals. However, few MAPKK have been functionally characterized in grapevine. In the study, five MAPKK (MKK) members were identified in grapevine (cultivar 'Pinot Noir'), cloned and designated as VvMKK1-VvMKK5. A phylogenetic analysis grouped them into four sub-families based on the similarity of their conserved motifs and gene structure to Arabidopsis MAPKK members. qRT-PCR results indicated that the expression of VvMKK1, VvMKK2, VvMKK4, and VvMKK5 were up-regulated in mature leaf and young blades, and roots, but exhibited low expression in leaf petioles. VvMKK2, VvMKK3, and VvMKK5 genes were differentially up-regulated when grapevine leaves were inoculated with spores of Erisyphe necator, or treated with salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ETH), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> or exposed to drought, indicating that these genes may be involved in a variety of signaling pathways. Over expression of VvMKK2 and VvMKK4 genes in transgenic Arabidopsis plants resulted in the production of seeds with a significantly higher germination and survival rate, and better seedling growth under stress conditions than wild-type plants. Overexpression of VvMKK2 in Arabidopsis improved salt and drought stress tolerance while overexpression of VvMKK4 only improved salt stress tolerance. Results of the present investigation provide a better understanding of the interaction and function of MAPKKK-MAPKK-MAPK genes at the transcriptional level in grapevine and led to the identification of candidate genes for drought and salt stress in grapes.
