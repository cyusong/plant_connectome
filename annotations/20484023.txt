Soybean (Glycine max) RPG1-B (for resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea) mediates species-specific resistance to P. syringae expressing the avirulence protein AvrB, similar to the nonorthologous RPM1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). RPM1-derived signaling is presumably induced upon AvrB-derived modification of the RPM1-interacting protein, RIN4 (for RPM1-interacting 4). We show that, similar to RPM1, RPG1-B does not directly interact with AvrB but associates with RIN4-like proteins from soybean. Unlike Arabidopsis, soybean contains at least four RIN4-like proteins (GmRIN4a to GmRIN4d). GmRIN4b, but not GmRIN4a, complements the Arabidopsis rin4 mutation. Both GmRIN4a and GmRIN4b bind AvrB, but only GmRIN4b binds RPG1-B. Silencing either GmRIN4a or GmRIN4b abrogates RPG1-B-derived resistance to P. syringae expressing AvrB. Binding studies show that GmRIN4b interacts with GmRIN4a as well as with two other AvrB/RPG1-B-interacting isoforms, GmRIN4c and GmRIN4d. The lack of functional redundancy among GmRIN4a and GmRIN4b and their abilities to interact with each other suggest that the two proteins might function as a heteromeric complex in mediating RPG1-B-derived resistance. Silencing GmRIN4a or GmRIN4b in rpg1-b plants enhances basal resistance to virulent strains of P. syringae and the oomycete Phytophthora sojae. Interestingly, GmRIN4a- or GmRIN4b-silenced rpg1-b plants respond differently to AvrB-expressing bacteria. Although both GmRIN4a and GmRIN4b function to monitor AvrB in the presence of RPG1-B, GmRIN4a, but not GmRIN4b, negatively regulates AvrB virulence activity in the absence of RPG1-B.
