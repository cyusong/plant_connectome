['17526732', 'Transcription corepressors are general regulators controlling the expression of  genes involved in multiple signaling pathways and developmental programs.  Repression is mediated through mechanisms including the stabilization of a  repressive chromatin structure over control regions and regulation of Mediator  function inhibiting RNA polymerase II activity. Using whole-genome arrays we show  that the Arabidopsis thaliana corepressor LEUNIG, a member of the GroTLE  transcription corepressor family, regulates the expression of multiple targets in  vivo. LEUNIG has a role in the regulation of genes involved in a number of  different physiological processes including disease resistance, DNA damage  response, and cell signaling. We demonstrate that repression of in vivo LEUNIG  targets is achieved through histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent and -independent  mechanisms. HDAC-dependent mechanisms involve direct interaction with HDA19, a  class 1 HDAC, whereas an HDAC-independent repression activity involves  interactions with the putative Arabidopsis Mediator components AtMED14/SWP and  AtCDK8/HEN3. We suggest that changes in chromatin structure coupled with  regulation of Mediator function are likely to be utilized by LEUNIG in the  repression of gene transcription.', '2007 Aug', 'Mol Cell Biol', '10.1128/MCB.01912-06', 'Conlan']
