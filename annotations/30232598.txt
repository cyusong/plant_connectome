The combination of genotypic selection, targeted and improved cultivation, and processing techniques for specific applications gives C. ladanifer the potential to be used as a valuable resource in Mediterranean areas with poor agronomic advantages. Cistus ladanifer (rockrose) is a perennial shrub, well adapted to the Mediterranean climate and possibly to upcoming environmental changes. As a sequence to a thorough review on taxonomic, morphological, chemical and competitive aspects of C. ladanifer, the research team focuses here on the economic potential of C. ladanifer: from production to applications, highlighting also known biological activities of extracts and their compounds. The use of this natural resource may be a viable solution for poor and contaminated soils with no need for large agricultural techniques, because this species is highly resistant to pests, diseases and extreme environmental factors. In addition, this species reveals interesting aptitudes that can be applied to food, pharmaceutical, phytochemical and biofuel industries. The final synthesis highlights research lines toward the exploitation of this neglected resource, such as selection of plant lines for specific applications and development of agronomic and processing techniques.
