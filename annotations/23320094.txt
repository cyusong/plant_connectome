['23320094', "Cajal bodies (CBs) are dynamic subnuclear compartments involved in the biogenesis  of ribonucleoproteins. Coilin is a major structural scaffolding protein necessary  for CB formation, composition and activity. The predicted secondary structure of  Arabidopsis thaliana coilin (Atcoilin) suggests that the protein is composed of  three main domains. Analysis of the physical properties of deletion mutants  indicates that Atcoilin might consist of an N-terminal globular domain, a central  highly disordered domain and a C-terminal domain containing a presumable  Tudor-like structure adjacent to a disordered C terminus. Despite the low  homology in amino acid sequences, a similar type of domain organization is likely  shared by human and animal coilin proteins and coilin-like proteins of various  plant species. Atcoilin is able to bind RNA effectively and in a non-specific  manner. This activity is provided by three RNA-binding sites: two sets of basic  amino acids in the N-terminal domain and one set in the central domain.  Interaction with RNA induces the multimerization of the Atcoilin molecule, a  consequence of the structural alterations in the N-terminal domain. The  interaction with RNA and subsequent multimerization may facilitate coilin's  function as a scaffolding protein. A model of the N-terminal domain is also  proposed.", '2013', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0053571', 'Kalinina']
