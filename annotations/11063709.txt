['11063709', 'A central question in biology is how genes control the expression of quantitative  variation. We used statistical methods to estimate genetic variation in eight  Arabidopsis thaliana floral characters (fresh flower mass, petal length, petal  width, sepal length, sepal width, long stamen length, short stamen length, and  pistil length) in a cosmopolitan sample of 15 ecotypes. In addition, we used  genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to evaluate the genetic basis  of variation in these same traits in the Landsberg erecta x Columbia recombinant  inbred line population. There was significant genetic variation for all traits in  both the sample of naturally occurring ecotypes and in the Ler x Col recombinant  inbred line population. In addition, broad-sense genetic correlations among the  traits were positive and high. A composite interval mapping (CIM) analysis  detected 18 significant QTL affecting at least one floral character. Eleven QTL  were associated with several floral traits, supporting either pleiotropy or tight  linkage as major determinants of flower morphological integration. We propose  several candidate genes that may underlie these QTL on the basis of positional  information and functional arguments. Genome-wide QTL mapping is a promising tool  for the discovery of candidate genes controlling morphological development, the  detection of novel phenotypic effects for known genes, and in generating a more  complete understanding of the genetic basis of floral development.', '2000 Nov', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/156.3.1379', 'Mackay']
