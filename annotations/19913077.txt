['19913077', 'Cytokinin is an essential regulator of numerous plant growth and developmental  processes. However, less is known about the mechanisms of cytokinin-regulated  floral development. In the present study, we found that flower-specific elevation  of cytokinin through transgenic expression of an Arabidopsis ATP/ADP  isopentenyltransferase 4 (AtIPT4) gene under the control of the APETALA1 (AP1)  promoter lead to floral developmental alterations. These changes included  promotion of the number of flowers and abnormal development of flowers, which  were correlated with enlarged inflorescence and flower meristems. Genome-wide  expression profiling revealed that a large number of genes were responsive to  increased cytokinin levels, including this first report that the expression of  CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) and CUC3 is elevated by cytokinin. Further analysis  showed that mutation of cuc2 or cuc3 attenuates the phenotypes caused by the  AP1Colon, two colonsAtIPT4 transgene. Mutation of the cytokinin receptors  Arabidopsis histidine kinase 2 (AHK2) and AHK3 nearly abolished the transgene  phenotypes and the enhanced CUC2 and CUC3 transcription induced by cytokinin. Our  results indicate that the overproduced cytokinin in flower primordia results in  alteration of floral development mainly through AHK2 and AHK3 signaling leading  to increased expression of the effector genes CUC2 and CUC3. Thus, it is likely  that the CUC2 and CUC3 expression mediated by AHK2 and AHK3 signaling may play  roles in regulation of flower development.', '2010 Jan 15', 'Gene', '10.1016/j.gene.2009.11.003', 'Zhang']
