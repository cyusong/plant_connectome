Soybean [<i>Glycine max</i> (L.) Merr. ] is one of the most strategical oilseed crops that provides sustainable source of protein and oil worldwide. Cultivation of soybean is severely affected by root-knot nematode (RKN). However, the mechanism of RKN parasitism to soybeans is largely unknown. In this study, we identify <i>GmLMM1</i>, which encodes a homolog of FERONIA-like receptor kinase in soybean, as a susceptible gene toward nematode. Mutations of <i>GmLMM1</i> exhibit enhanced resistance against the RKN <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis reveals a similar differential expression pattern for genes regulated by <i>GmLMM1</i> (<i>Gmlmm1</i> vs. wild-type) and <i>M. incognita</i> (<i>M. incognita</i> vs. mock), supporting the role of <i>GmLMM1</i> in <i>M. incognita</i> infection. Unlike FERONIA in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, GmLMM1 specifically binds to <i>Mi</i>RALF1 and <i>At</i>RALF23 that suppress plant immunity, but not <i>Mi</i>RALF3 and <i>At</i>RALF1. Moreover, we found that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in <i>GmLMM1</i> leads to the natural resistance against RKNs in soybeans. Collectively, these findings uncover GmLMM1 as a susceptible target of nematode RALF-like 1 and provide new genetic resource for nematode resistant breeding.
