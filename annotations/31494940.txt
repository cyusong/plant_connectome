Interactions between mutualists, competitors, and antagonists have contrasting ecological effects that, sustained over generations, can influence micro- and macroevolution. Dissimilar benefits and costs for these interactions should cause contrasting co-diversification patterns between interacting clades, with prevalent co-speciation by mutualists, association loss by competitors, and host switching by antagonists. We assessed these expectations for a local assemblage of 26 fig species (Moraceae: Ficus), 26 species of mutualistic (pollinating), and 33 species of parasitic (galling) wasps (Chalcidoidea). Using newly acquired gene sequences, we inferred the phylogenies for all three clades. We then compared the three possible pairs of phylogenies to assess phylogenetic congruence and the relative frequencies of co-speciation, association duplication, switching, and loss. The paired phylogenies of pollinators with their mutualists and competitors were significantly congruent, unlike that of figs and their parasites. The distributions of macroevolutionary events largely agreed with expectations for mutualists and antagonists. By contrast, that for competitors involved relatively frequent association switching, as expected, but also unexpectedly frequent co-speciation. The latter result likely reflects the heterogeneous nature of competition among fig wasps. These results illustrate the influence of different interspecific interactions on co-diversification, while also revealing its dependence on specific characteristics of those interactions.
