The cellular and subcellular localization of FtsZ, a bacterial cell division protein, were investigated in vegetative cells of the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc/Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. We show by using immunogold-transmission electron microscopy that FtsZ forms a ring structure in a filamentous cyanobacterium, similar to observations in unicellular bacteria and chloroplasts. This finding, that the FtsZ in a filamentous cyanobacterium accumulates at the growing edge of the division septa leading to the formation of the typical prokaryotic Z-ring arrangement, is novel. Moreover, an apparent cytoplasmic distribution of FtsZ occurred in vegetative cells. During the transition of vegetative cells into terminally differentiated heterocysts the cytoplasmic FtsZ levels decreased substantially. These findings suggest a conserved function of FtsZ among prokaryotes, including filamentous cyanobacteria with cell differentiation capacity, and possibly a role of FtsZ as a cytoskeletal component in the cytoplasm.
