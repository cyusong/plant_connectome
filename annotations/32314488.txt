['32314488', 'The sugar status of a plant acts as a signal affecting growth and development.  The phenomenon by which high levels of sugars inhibit seedling establishment has  been widely used to gain insight into sugar-signaling pathways. Natural allelic  variation has been identified at the ANAC060 locus. The Arabidopsis Columbia  ecotype produces a short ANAC060 protein without a transmembrane domain that is  constitutively located to the nucleus, causing sugar insensitivity when  overexpressed. In this study, we generated a genome-wide DNA-binding map of  ANAC060 via chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing using transgenic lines that  express a functional ANAC060-GFP fusion protein in an anac060 background. A total  of 3282 genes associated with ANAC060-binding sites were identified. These genes  were enriched in biotic and abiotic stress responses, and the G-box binding motif  was highly enriched in ANAC060-bound genomic regions. Expression microarray  analysis resulted in the identification of 8350 genes whose activities were  altered in the anac060 mutant and upon sugar treatment. Cluster analysis revealed  that ANAC060 attenuates sugar-regulated gene expression. Direct target genes of  ANAC060 included equivalent numbers of genes that were upregulated or  downregulated by ANAC060. The various functions of these target genes indicate  that ANAC060 has several functions. Our results demonstrate that ANAC060 directly  binds to the promoter of ABI5 and represses the sugar-induced transcription of  ABI5. Genetic data indicate that ABI5 is epistatic to ANAC060 in both sugar and  abscisic acid responses.', '2020 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14777', 'ORCID:']
