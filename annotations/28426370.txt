Cotton fibers are differentiated ovule epidermal cells that provide an ideal model to study cell differentiation and elongation. Establishment of auxin maximum in fiber cells is crucial for cotton-fiber protrusion from ovule surface. However, it is unclear where the auxin originates from and how the auxin accumulates in fiber cells. Our recent results indicate that the auxin is mainly imported from the outside of ovules, and transported to fiber cells through GhPIN (homolog of PIN-formed proteins in cotton) -mediated polar auxin transport, rather than in situ synthesis. Based on our finding in GhPINs, we discuss here briefly how auxin flow to fiber cells and auxin gradient in ovule epidermis is established mainly by GhPIN3a protein.

GhPIN3a: !mediates! polar auxin transport 
auxin: !imported from! outside of ovules 
GhPIN3a: !establishes! auxin gradient in ovule epidermis 
auxin: !accumulates in! fiber cells
