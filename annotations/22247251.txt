['22247251', 'In plants, reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with the response to pathogen  attack are generated by NADPH oxidases or apoplastic peroxidases. Antisense  expression of a heterologous French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) peroxidase (FBP1)  cDNA in Arabidopsis thaliana was previously shown to diminish the expression of  two Arabidopsis peroxidases (peroxidase 33 [PRX33] and PRX34), block the  oxidative burst in response to a fungal elicitor, and cause enhanced  susceptibility to a broad range of fungal and bacterial pathogens. Here we show  that mature leaves of T-DNA insertion lines with diminished expression of PRX33  and PRX34 exhibit reduced ROS and callose deposition in response to  microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), including the synthetic peptides  Flg22 and Elf26 corresponding to bacterial flagellin and elongation factor Tu,  respectively. PRX33 and PRX34 knockdown lines also exhibited diminished  activation of Flg22-activated genes after Flg22 treatment. These MAMP-activated  genes were also downregulated in unchallenged leaves of the peroxidase knockdown  lines, suggesting that a low level of apoplastic ROS production may be required  to preprime basal resistance. Finally, the PRX33 knockdown line is more  susceptible to Pseudomonas syringae than wild-type plants. In aggregate, these  data demonstrate that the peroxidase-dependent oxidative burst plays an important  role in Arabidopsis basal resistance mediated by the recognition of MAMPs.', '2012 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.093039', 'Bolwell']
