The alternation between diploid and haploid generations is fundamental in the life cycles of both animals and plants. The meiotic cell cycle is common to both animals and plants gamete formation, but in animals the products of meiosis are gametes, whereas for most plants, subsequent mitotic cell cycles are needed for their formation. Clarifying the regulatory mechanisms of mitotic cell cycle progression during gametophyte development will help understanding of sexual reproduction in plants. Many mutants defective in gametophyte development and, in particular, many meiotic and mitotic cell cycle mutants in Arabidopsis male and female gametophyte development were identified through both forward and reverse genetics approaches.
