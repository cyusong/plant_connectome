['23609044', 'We previously reported on the A. thaliana gene EDM2, which is required for  several developmental processes and race-specific immunity. Although EDM2 encodes  a nuclear protein with features commonly observed in epigenetic factors, its role  in chromatin silencing remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that silencing states  of several transposons in edm2 mutants are altered. Levels of their transcripts  anti-correlate with those of the repressive epigenetic marks H3K27me1, H3K9me2,  and DNA-methylation at CHG sites. In addition, double mutant analysis revealed  epistasis between EDM2 and the major histone H3K9-methyltransferase gene  KRYPTONITE/SUVH4 in the control of H3K9me2 and CHG methylation. Moreover, we  found that the expressivity of several mutant edm2 phenotypes exhibits stochastic  variation reminiscent of mutants of known epigenetic modifiers. We propose that  EDM2 affects the expression of transposons and developmentally important genes by  modulating levels of repressive chromatin marks in a locus dependent manner.', '2013', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep01701', 'Eulgem']
