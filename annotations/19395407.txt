['19395407', "Ascorbic acid (AsA) biosynthesis in plants occurs through a complex,  interconnected network with mannose (Man), myoinositol, and galacturonic acid as  principal entry points. Regulation within and between pathways in the network is  largely uncharacterized. A gene that regulates the Man/l-galactose (l-Gal) AsA  pathway, AMR1 (for ascorbic acid mannose pathway regulator 1), was identified in  an activation-tagged Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ozone-sensitive mutant  that had 60% less leaf AsA than wild-type plants. In contrast, two independent  T-DNA knockout lines disrupting AMR1 accumulated 2- to 3-fold greater foliar AsA  and were more ozone tolerant than wild-type controls. Real-time reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of steady-state transcripts of  genes involved in AsA biosynthesis showed that AMR1 negatively affected the  expression of GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase, GDP-l-Gal phosphorylase,  l-Gal-1-phosphate phosphatase, GDP-Man-3',5'-epimerase, l-Gal dehydrogenase, and  l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase, early and late enzymes of the Man/l-Gal  pathway to AsA. AMR1 expression appears to be developmentally and environmentally  controlled. As leaves aged, AMR1 transcripts accumulated with a concomitant  decrease in AsA. AMR1 transcripts also decreased with increased light intensity.  Thus, AMR1 appears to play an important role in modulating AsA levels in  Arabidopsis by regulating the expression of major pathway genes in response to  developmental and environmental cues.", '2009 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.138453', 'Nessler']
