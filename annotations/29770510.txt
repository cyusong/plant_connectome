['29770510', 'In mammals, tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factors (TRAFs) are  signaling adaptors that regulate diverse physiological processes, including  immunity and stress responses. In Arabidopsis, MUSE13 and MUSE14 are redundant  TRAF proteins serving as adaptors in the SCF(CRP1) complex to facilitate the  turnover of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeats (NLR) immune  receptors. Degradation of MUSE13 is inhibited by proteasome inhibitor, suggesting  that the MUSE13 stability is controlled by the 26S proteasome. However, the E3  ligase that regulates MUSE13 level is unknown. Here we report the identification  of an F-box protein, SNIPER4 that regulates the turnover of MUSE13 and MUSE14.  Protein levels of MUSE13 and MUSE14 are reduced by SNIPER4 overexpression, while  higher accumulation of MUSE13 and MUSE14 is observed when dominant-negative  SNIPER4 is expressed. Furthermore, SNIPER4 associates with MUSE13 or MUSE14.  Taken together, the SCF(SNIPER4) complex controls the turnover of TRAF proteins  for an optimum immune output.', '2018 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13965', 'Li']
