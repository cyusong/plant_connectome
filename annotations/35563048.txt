Plant diseases caused by fungi are one of the major threats to global food security and understanding the interactions between fungi and plants is of great significance for plant disease control. The interaction between pathogenic fungi and plants is a complex process. From the perspective of pathogenic fungi, pathogenic fungi are involved in the regulation of pathogenicity by surface signal recognition proteins, MAPK signaling pathways, transcription factors, and pathogenic factors in the process of infecting plants. From the perspective of plant immunity, the signal pathway of immune response, the signal transduction pathway that induces plant immunity, and the function of plant cytoskeleton are the keys to studying plant resistance. In this review, we summarize the current research progress of fungi-plant interactions from multiple aspects and discuss the prospects and challenges of phytopathogenic fungi and their host interactions.
