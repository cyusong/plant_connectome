['12446847', 'The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), synthesized in response to water-deficit  stress, induces stomatal closure via activation of complex signaling cascades.  Recent work has established that nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule  mediating ABA-induced stomatal closure. However, the biosynthetic origin of NO in  guard cells has not yet been resolved. Here, we provide pharmacological,  physiological, and genetic evidence that NO synthesis in Arabidopsis guard cells  is mediated by the enzyme nitrate reductase (NR). Guard cells of wild-type  Arabidopsis generate NO in response to treatment with ABA and nitrite, a  substrate for NR. Moreover, NR-mediated NO synthesis is required for ABA-induced  stomatal closure. However, in the NR double mutant, nia1, nia2 that has  diminished NR activity, guard cells do not synthesize NO nor do the stomata close  in response to ABA or nitrite, although stomatal opening is still inhibited by  ABA. Furthermore, by using the ABA-insensitive (ABI) abi1-1 and abi2-1 mutants,  we show that the ABI1 and ABI2 protein phosphatases are downstream of NO in the  ABA signal-transduction cascade. These data demonstrate a previously  uncharacterized signaling role for NR, that of mediating ABA-induced NO synthesis  in Arabidopsis guard cells.', '2002 Dec 10', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.252461999', 'Neill']
