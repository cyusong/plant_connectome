['27288222', 'RAB5 GTPases act as molecular switches that regulate various endosomal functions  in animal cells, including homotypic fusion of early endosomes, endosomal  motility, endosomal signaling, and subcompartmentalization of the endosomal  membrane. RAB5 proteins fulfill these diverse functions through interactions with  downstream effector molecules. Two canonical RAB5 members, ARA7 and RAB HOMOLOG1  (RHA1), are encoded in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. ARA7 and RHA1 play  crucial roles in endocytic and vacuolar trafficking pathways. Plant RAB5 GTPases  function via interactions with effector molecules, whose identities and functions  are currently unclear. In this study, we searched for canonical RAB5 effector  molecules of Arabidopsis and identified a candidate, which we called ENDOSOMAL  RAB EFFECTOR WITH PX-DOMAIN (EREX). The intimate genetic interaction between EREX  and RAB5 members, the results from subcellular colocalization experiments, and  the direct interaction observed in an in vitro pull-down assay strongly suggest  that EREX is a genuine effector of canonical RAB5s in Arabidopsis. We further  found that close homologs of EREX play partially redundant functions with EREX in  the transport of seed storage proteins. Our results indicate that canonical plant  RAB5s acquired distinct effector molecules from those of non-plant systems to  fulfill their functions.', '2016 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00326', 'Ueda']
