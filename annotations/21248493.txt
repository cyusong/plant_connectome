We recently evidenced that plant response to cold stress includes a rapid formation of nitric oxide (NO) that participates in the control of cold-responsive gene expression. Unexpectedly we also shed light on a novel downstream element of NO signalling that is phosphosphingolipid (PS) metabolism. Indeed, two phosphosphingolipid species, phytosphingosine phosphate (PHS-P) and a ceramide phosphate (Cer-P) are specifically synthesized upon cold exposure. Manipulating NO levels by pharmacological or genetic means dramatically modified the cold-triggered synthesis of PHS-P and Cer-P, but did not affect the cold-responsive formation of phosphatidic acid (PtdOH), a ubiquitous lipid signal derived from phospholipid degradation. So far no crosstalk between NO and PS signalling had been reported in plants. How NO might modulate PS formation and whether this regulation might be extended to other physiological processes are further discussed.
