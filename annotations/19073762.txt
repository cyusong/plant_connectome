['19073762', 'We have identified the novel protein Glycine max PEROXISOMAL ADENINE NUCLEOTIDE  CARRIER (Gm PNC1) by proteomic analyses of peroxisomal membrane proteins using a  blue native/SDS-PAGE technique combined with peptide mass fingerprinting. Gm  PNC1, and the Arabidopsis thaliana orthologs At PNC1 and At PNC2, were targeted  to peroxisomes. Functional integration of Gm PNC1 and At PNC2 into the  cytoplasmic membranes of intact Escherichia coli cells revealed ATP and ADP  import activities. The amount of Gm PNC1 in cotyledons increased until 5 d after  germination under constant darkness and then decreased very rapidly in response  to illumination. We investigated the physiological functions of PNC1 in  peroxisomal metabolism by analyzing a transgenic Arabidopsis plant in which At  PNC1 and At PNC2 expression was suppressed using RNA interference. The pnc1/2i  mutant required sucrose for germination and suppressed the degradation of storage  lipids during postgerminative growth. These results suggest that PNC1 contributes  to the transport of adenine nucleotides that are consumed by reactions that  generate acyl-CoA for peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation during  postgerminative growth.', '2008 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.062877', 'Nishimura']
