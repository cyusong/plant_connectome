Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is characterized by its diverse and flexible sexual types. Here, we evaluated the effect of low temperature (LT) exposure on cucumber femaleness under short-day conditions. Shoot apices were subjected to whole-genome bisulfate sequencing (WGBS), mRNA-seq, and sRNA-seq. The results showed that temperature had a substantial and global impact on transposable element (TE)-related small RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) mechanisms, resulting in large amounts of CHH-type cytosine demethylation. In the cucumber genome, TEs are common in regions near genes that are also subject to DNA demethylation. TE-gene interactions showed very strong reactions to LT treatment, as nearly 80% of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were distributed in genic regions. Demethylation near genes led to the co-ordinated expression of genes and TEs. More importantly, genome-wide de novo methylation changes also resulted in small amounts of CG- and CHG-type DMRs. Methylation changes in CG-DMRs located <600 bp from the transcription start and end sites (TSSs/TESs) negatively correlated with transcription changes in differentially expressed genes (DEGs), probably indicating epiregulation. Ethylene is called the 'sex hormone' of cucumbers. We observed the up-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis-related CsACO3 and the down-regulation of an Arabidopsis RAP2.4-like ethylene-responsive (AP2/ERF) transcription factor, demonstrating the inferred epiregulation. Our study characterized the response of the apex methylome to LT and predicted the possible epiregulation of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in cucumber.
