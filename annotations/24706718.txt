To complement N2 fixation through symbiosis, legumes can efficiently acquire soil mineral N through adapted root architecture. However, root architecture adaptation to mineral N availability has been little studied in legumes. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of nitrate availability on root architecture in Medicago truncatula and assessed the N-uptake potential of a new highly branched root mutant, TR185. The effects of varying nitrate supply on both root architecture and N uptake were characterized in the mutant and in the wild type. Surprisingly, the root architecture of the mutant was not modified by variation in nitrate supply. Moreover, despite its highly branched root architecture, TR185 had a permanently N-starved phenotype. A transcriptome analysis was performed to identify genes differentially expressed between the two genotypes. This analysis revealed differential responses related to the nitrate acquisition pathway and confirmed that N starvation occurred in TR185. Changes in amino acid content and expression of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway were associated with differences in root architecture between the mutant and the wild type.
