Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) has long been viewed as toxic gas and air pollutant, but now is being verified as a signaling molecule in mammalian cells. SO<sub>2</sub> can be endogenously produced and rapidly transformed into sulfur-containing compounds (e.g., hydrogen sulfide, cysteine, methionine, glutathione, glucosinolate, and phytochelatin) to maintain its homeostasis in plant cells. Exogenous application of SO<sub>2</sub> in the form of gas or solution can trigger the expression of thousands of genes. The physiological functions of these genes are involved in the antioxidant defense, osmotic adjustment, and synthesis of stress proteins, secondary metabolites, and plant hormones, thus modulating numerous plant physiological processes. The modulated physiological processes by SO<sub>2</sub> are implicated in seed germination, stomatal action, postharvest physiology, and plant response to environmental stresses. However, the review on the signaling role of SO<sub>2</sub> in plants is little. In this review, the anabolism and catabolism of SO<sub>2</sub> in plants were summarized. In addition, the signaling role of SO<sub>2</sub> in seed germination, stomatal movement, fruit fresh-keeping, and plant response to environmental stresses (including drought, cold, heavy metal, and pathogen stresses) was discussed. Finally, the research direction of SO<sub>2</sub> in plants is also proposed.
