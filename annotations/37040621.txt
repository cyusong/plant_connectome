SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1 (SOS1) is a key component of plant salt tolerance. However, how SOS1 transcription is dynamically regulated in plant response to different salinity conditions remains elusive. Here, we report that C-type Cyclin1; 1 (CycC1; 1) negatively regulates salt tolerance by interfering with WRKY75-mediated transcriptional activation of SOS1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Disruption of CycC1; 1 promotes SOS1 expression and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis because CycC1; 1 interferes with RNA polymerase II recruitment by occupying the SOS1 promoter. Enhanced salt tolerance of the cycc1; 1 mutant was completely compromised by an SOS1 mutation. Moreover, CycC1; 1 physically interacts with the transcription factor WRKY75, which can bind to the SOS1 promoter and activate SOS1 expression. In contrast to the cycc1; 1 mutant, the wrky75 mutant has attenuated SOS1 expression and salt tolerance, whereas overexpression of SOS1 rescues the salt sensitivity of wrky75. Intriguingly, CycC1; 1 inhibits WRKY75-mediated transcriptional activation of SOS1 via their interaction. Thus, increased SOS1 expression and salt tolerance in cycc1; 1 was abolished by WRKY75 mutation. Our findings demonstrate that CycC1; 1 forms a complex with WRKY75 to inactivate SOS1 transcription under low salinity conditions. By contrast, under high salinity conditions, SOS1 transcription and plant salt tolerance is activated at least partially by increased WRKY75 expression but decreased CycC1; 1 expression.
