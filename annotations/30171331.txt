Stress induction followed by excessive calcium influx causes multiple changes in microspores resulting in chromatin remodeling, epigenetic modifications, and removal of unwanted gametophytic components via autophagy, switching microspores towards ME. In Brassica, isolated microspores that are placed under specific external stresses can switch their default developmental pathway towards an embryogenic state. Microspore embryogenesis is a unique system that speeds up breeding programs and, in the context of developmental biology, provides an excellent tool for embryogenesis to be investigated in greater detail. The last few years have provided ample evidence that has allowed Brassica researchers to markedly increase their understanding of the molecular and sub-cellular changes underlying this process. We review recent advances in this field, focusing mainly on the perception to inductive stresses, signal transduction, molecular and structural alterations, and the involvement of programmed cell death at the onset of embryogenic induction.
