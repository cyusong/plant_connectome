An inducible post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) system was established in Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana Mill.) cells. This system is based on the activation of an antisense gfp gene construct by a chimeric transcriptional activator GVG (Gal4-binding domain-VP16 activation domain-glucocorticoid receptor fusion) upon application of the inducer to gfp transgenic cell lines. A detailed characterization of the inducible PTGS system in transgenic cell lines demonstrated that this system is stringently controlled. The degree of silencing with this construct could be regulated by the concentration of inducer and the time of treatment. Such transgenic cell lines may provide a useful system to study signaling mechanisms of gene silencing in transgenic pine cells. The inducible system could be a useful tool for functional discovery of novel plant genes.
