Ethylene-responsive factors play important roles in the biotic and abiotic stresses. Only some <i>ERF</i> genes from <i>Capsicum annuum</i> have been characterized. In the study, the <i>CaERF1A</i> gene is characterized in response to biotic stress. <i>CaERF1A</i> transcripts were induced by various plant defense-related hormone treatments. Knockdown of <i>CaERF1A</i> in hot pepper plants are negatively affected <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-P<sub>0</sub>-mediated hypersensitive response cell death, resulting in reduced gene expression of pathogenesis-related genes and ethylene and jasmonic acid synthesis-related gene. Overexpressing <i>CaERF1A</i> transgenic plants show enhanced resistance to fungal pathogen via regulating ethylene and jasmonic acid synthesis-related gene expression. Thus, CaERF1A is a positive regulator of plant defense by modulating ethylene and jasmonic acid synthesis-related gene expressions.
