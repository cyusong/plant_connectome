Although high pollinator visitation is crucial to ensure the yields of pollinator-dependent crops, the quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling nectar volume in sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i> L.), a pollinator preference trait, have yet to be identified. To address this, a recombinant inbred line mapping population, derived from lines with contrasting nectar volume, was used to identify loci responsible for the phenotype. As a result, linkage mapping and QTL analysis discovered major loci on chromosomes 2 and 16 that are associated with variation in nectar volume in sunflower. Increased nectar volume is also associated with increased sugars and total energy available per floret. The regions on chromosomes 2 and 16 associated with the nectar phenotype exhibit indications of chromosome structural variation, such that the phenotype is associated with rearrangements affecting regions containing hundreds of genes. Candidate genes underlying QTL on chromosomes 9 and 16 are homologous to genes with nectary function in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. These results have implications for sunflower breeding, to enhance pollination efficiency in sunflower, as well as current and future studies on sunflower evolution.
