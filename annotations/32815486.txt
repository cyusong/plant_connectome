Due to irrigation practices and industrial pollution, large areas of the lands in the world are simultaneously affected by salinity and heavy metal contamination. It has been considered that halophytes have adapted to salinity, and can be used to remediate heavy metal-contaminated saline soils. <i>Suaeda salsa</i> L. (<i>S. salsa</i>) is a high salt-resistance plant, which can efficiently absorb and accumulate salt and toxic metals from saline soils, suggesting that this may be potential plant species that can be used for the restoration of saline soils contaminated with heavy metals. The present brief review sheds light on the characteristics of <i>S. salsa</i> in the uptake and accumulation of high levels of heavy metals. Furthermore, the physiological and molecular mechanisms for heavy metal tolerance were highlighted. The potential values of <i>S. salsa</i> in the remediation of saline soils were also summarized.
