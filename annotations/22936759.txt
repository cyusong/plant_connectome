Bayon et al. (Reports, 9 March 2012, p. 1219) claim that the "rainforest crisis" in Central Africa centered around 2500 years before the present "was not triggered by natural climatic factors" and that it was caused by widespread deforestation resulting from the arrival of the Bantu colonists. However, there is a consensus among palaeoecologists that this landscape change and the related physical erosion it caused was due mainly to a shift to more seasonal rainfall regime.

Bantu colonists: !caused! Deforestation
Deforestation: !led to! Landscape change
Landscape change: !resulted in! Physical erosion
Rainfall regime: !shifted to! More seasonal
