['25490919', 'DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) is a key transcription  factor for drought and heat stress tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. DREB2A  induces the expression of dehydration- and heat stress-inducible genes under the  corresponding stress conditions. Target gene selectivity is assumed to require  stress-specific posttranslational regulation, but the mechanisms of this process  are not yet understood. Here, we identified DNA POLYMERASE II SUBUNIT B3-1  (DPB3-1), which was previously annotated as NUCLEAR FACTOR Y, SUBUNIT C10  (NF-YC10), as a DREB2A interactor, through a yeast two-hybrid screen. The  overexpression of DPB3-1 in Arabidopsis enhanced the expression of a subset of  heat stress-inducible DREB2A target genes but did not affect  dehydration-inducible genes. Similarly, the depletion of DPB3-1 expression  resulted in reduced expression of heat stress-inducible genes. Interaction and  expression pattern analyses suggested the existence of a trimer comprising  NF-YA2, NF-YB3, and DPB3-1 that could synergistically activate a promoter of the  heat stress-inducible gene with DREB2A in protoplasts. These results suggest that  DPB3-1 could form a transcriptional complex with NF-YA and NF-YB subunits and  that the identified trimer enhances heat stress-inducible gene expression during  heat stress responses in cooperation with DREB2A. We propose that the identified  trimer contributes to the target gene selectivity of DREB2A under heat stress  conditions.', '2014 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.132928', 'ORCID:']
