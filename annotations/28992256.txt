Epistasis and genetic variance heterogeneity are two non-additive genetic inheritance patterns that are often, but not always, related. Here we use theoretical examples and empirical results from earlier analyses of experimental data to illustrate the connection between the two. This includes an introduction to the relationship between epistatic gene action, statistical epistasis, and genetic variance heterogeneity, and a brief discussion about how genetic processes other than epistasis can also give rise to genetic variance heterogeneity.
