['34233164', 'Many organisms evolved strategies to survive desiccation. Plant seeds protect  dehydrated embryos from various stressors and can lay dormant for millennia.  Hydration is the key trigger to initiate germination, but the mechanism by which  seeds sense water remains unresolved. We identified an uncharacterized  Arabidopsis thaliana prion-like protein we named FLOE1, which phase separates  upon hydration and allows the embryo to sense water stress. We demonstrate that  biophysical states of FLOE1 condensates modulate its biological function in vivo  in suppressing seed germination under unfavorable environments. We find  intragenic, intraspecific, and interspecific natural variation in FLOE1  expression and phase separation and show that intragenic variation is associated  with adaptive germination strategies in natural populations. This combination of  molecular, organismal, and ecological studies uncovers FLOE1 as a tunable  environmental sensor with direct implications for the design of drought-resistant  crops, in the face of climate change.', '2021 Aug 5', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2021.06.009', 'Rhee']
