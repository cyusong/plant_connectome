['21682783', "The exosome is a conserved protein complex that is responsible for essential  3'-->5' RNA degradation in both the nucleus and the cytosol. It is composed of a  nine-subunit core complex to which co-factors confer both RNA substrate  recognition and ribonucleolytic activities. Very few exosome co-factors have been  identified in plants. Here, we have characterized a putative RNA helicase,  AtMTR4, that is involved in the degradation of several nucleolar exosome  substrates in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that AtMTR4, rather than its closely  related protein HEN2, is required for proper rRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis.  AtMTR4 is mostly localized in the nucleolus, a subcellular compartmentalization  that is shared with another exosome co-factor, RRP6L2. AtMTR4 and RRP6L2  cooperate in several steps of rRNA maturation and surveillance, such as  processing the 5.8S rRNA and removal of rRNA maturation by-products.  Interestingly, degradation of the Arabidopsis 5' external transcribed spacer (5'  ETS) requires cooperation of both the 5'-->3' and 3'-->5' exoribonucleolytic  pathways. Accumulating AtMTR4 targets give rise to illegitimate small RNAs;  however, these do not affect rRNA metabolism or contribute to the phenotype of  mtr4 mutants. Plants lacking AtMTR4 are viable but show several developmental  defects, including aberrant vein patterning and pointed first leaves. The mtr4  phenotype resembles that of several ribosomal protein and nucleolin mutants, and  may be explained by delayed ribosome biogenesis, as we observed a reduced rate of  rRNA accumulation in mtr4 mutants. Taken together, these data link AtMTR4 with  rRNA biogenesis and development in Arabidopsis.", '2011 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04675.x', 'Gagliardi']
