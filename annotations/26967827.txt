['26967827', 'Peptide signaling in plants is involved in regulating development, (1,2) ensuring  cross pollination through initiation of self-incompatibility (4) and assisting  with recognition of beneficial (nitrogen fixing bacteria (5)) or unfavorable  organisms (pathogens (6) or herbivores (7)). Peptides function to help plants to  respond to a changing environment and improve their chances of survival.  Constitutive expression of the gene encoding a novel cysteine rich peptide  TAXIMIN1 (TAX1) resulted in fusion of lateral organs and in abnormal fruit  morphology. TAX1 signaling functions independently from transcription factors  known to play a role in this process such as LATERAL ORGAN FUSION1 (LOF1). Here,  we report that the TAX1 promoter is not induced by the LOF1 transcription factor  and that the TAX1 peptide neither interferes with transcriptional activation by  LOF1.1 or transcriptional repression by LOF1.2. Furthermore, we found that TAX1  overexpressing lines were hypersensitive to continuous light, which may be  reflected by a decreased accumulation of the UV-B protecting compound  sinapoyl-malate. Finally, adding the antibiotic cefotaxime to the medium  surprisingly countered the light hypersensitivity phenotype of TAX1  overexpressing seedlings.', '2016', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.1080/15592324.2016.1143998', 'Goossens']
