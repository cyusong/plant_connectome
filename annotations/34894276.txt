Elevated temperatures suppress cell division in developing petunia buds leading to smaller flowers, mediated by ABA. Flower size is one of the most important showy traits in determining pollinator attraction, and a central factor determining the quality of floricultural products. Whereas the adverse effects of elevated temperatures on showy traits have been described in detail, its underlining mechanisms is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the physiological mechanism responsible for the reduction of flower size in petunia under elevated temperatures. We found that the early stages of flower-bud development were most sensitive to elevated temperatures, resulting in a drastic reduction of flower diameter that was almost independent of flower load. We demonstrated that the temperature-mediated flower size reduction occurred due to a shorter growth period, and a lower rate of corolla cell division. Consistently, local application of cytokinin, a phytohormone that promotes cell division, resulted in recovery of flower dimensions when grown under elevated temperatures. Hormone analysis of temperature-inhibited flower buds revealed no significant changes in levels of cytokinin, and a specific increase of abscisic acid (ABA) levels, known to inhibit cell division. Moreover, local application of ABA on flower buds caused a reduction of flower dimensions as a result of lower levels of cell division, suggesting that ABA mediates the reduction of flower size at elevated temperatures. Taken together, our results shed light on the mechanism by which elevated temperatures decrease petunia flower size, and show that temperature-mediated reduction of flower size can be alleviated by increasing the cytokinin/ABA ratio.
