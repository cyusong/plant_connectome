A lack of complete resistance in the current germplasm complicates the management of Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) caused by <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> in soybean. In this study, we used bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) as a vehicle to down-regulate expression of a key enzyme in the production of an important virulence factor in <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>, oxalic acid (OA). Specifically, we targeted a gene encoding oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase (<i>Ssoah1</i>), because <i>Ssoah1</i> deletion mutants are OA deficient and non-pathogenic on soybean. We first established that <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> can uptake environmental RNAs by monitoring the translocation of Cy3-labeled double-stranded and small interfering RNA (ds/siRNAs) into fungal hyphae using fluorescent confocal microscopy. This translocation led to a significant decrease in <i>Ssoah1</i> transcript levels <i>in vitro</i>. Inoculation of soybean plants with BPMV vectors targeting <i>Ssoah1</i> (pBPMV-OA) also led to decreased expression of <i>Ssoah1</i>. Importantly, pBPMV-OA inoculated plants showed enhanced resistance to <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> compared to empty-vector control plants. Our combined results provide evidence supporting the use of HIGS and exogenous applications of ds/siRNAs targeting virulence factors such as OA as viable strategies for the control of SSR in soybean and as discovery tools that can be used to identify previously unknown virulence factors.
