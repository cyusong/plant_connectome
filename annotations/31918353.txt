Infection with Cowpea severe mosaic virus (CPSMV) represents one of the main limitations for cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) productivity due to the severity of the disease symptoms, frequency of incidence, and difficulties in dissemination control. This study aimed to identify the proteins and metabolic pathways associated with the susceptibility and resistance of cowpea plants to CPSMV. Therefore, we treated the seeds of a naturally susceptible cowpea genotype (CE-31) with the mutagenic agent ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and compared the secondary leaf proteomic profile of the mutagenized resistant plants inoculated with CPSMV (MCPI plant group) to those of the naturally susceptible cowpea genotype CE-31 inoculated (CPI) and noninoculated (CPU) with CPSMV. MCPI responded to CPSMV by accumulating proteins involved in the oxidative burst, increasing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation, promoting leaf cell death (LCD), increasing the synthesis of defense proteins, and decreasing host factors important for the establishment of CPSMV infection. In contrast, CPI accumulated several host factors that favor CPSMV infection and did not accumulate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or present LCD, which allowed CPSMV replication and systemic dissemination. Based on these results, we propose that the differential abundance of defense proteins and proteins involved in the oxidative burst, LCD, and the decrease in cowpea protein factors required for CPSMV replication are associated with the resistance trait acquired by the MCPI plant group.
