The linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex is a protein complex spanning the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope. Outer nuclear membrane KASH proteins interact in the nuclear envelope lumen with inner nuclear membrane SUN proteins. The paralogous Arabidopsis KASH proteins SINE1 and SINE2 function during stomatal dynamics induced by light-dark transitions and ABA. Previous studies have shown F-actin organization, cytoplasmic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) oscillations, and vacuolar morphology changes are involved in ABA-induced stomatal closure. Here, we show that SINE1 and SINE2 are both required for actin pattern changes during ABA-induced stomatal closure, but influence different, temporally distinguishable steps. External Ca<sup>2+</sup> partially overrides the mutant defects. ABA-induced cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are diminished in <i>sine2-1</i> but not <i>sine1-1</i>, and this defect can be rescued by both exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> and F-actin depolymerization. We show first evidence for nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations during ABA-induced stomatal closure, which are disrupted in <i>sine2-1</i>. Vacuolar fragmentation is impaired in both mutants and is partially rescued by F-actin depolymerization. Together, these data indicate distinct roles for SINE1 and SINE2 upstream of this network of players involved in ABA-based stomatal closure, suggesting a role for the nuclear surface in guard cell ABA signaling.
