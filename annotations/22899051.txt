SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) is important in determining flowering time as well as floral organ identity. Although much is known about the regulation of floral organ identity by SEP3, its role as a downstream gene of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) for the regulation of ambient temperature-responsive flowering is poorly understood. Here, we show that SEP3 as a downstream gene of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE3 (SPL3) and FT modulates the flowering time in response to different ambient temperatures. SEP3 overexpression showed temperature-insensitive flowering at 23°C and 16°C. This suggests that altered SEP3 activity affects ambient temperature-responsive flowering. However, a lesion in SEP3 did not obviously affect ambient temperature-responsive flowering. SEP3 expression was affected by altered SPL3 and FT activities in the leaf and shoot apical regions at different temperatures. These results suggest that the miR156-SPL3-FT circuitry directly or indirectly regulates SEP3 expression for the regulation of ambient temperature-responsive flowering in Arabidopsis.
