In plants, highly reactive singlet oxygen (1O2) is known to inhibit photosynthesis and to damage the cell as a cytotoxin. However, more recent studies have also proposed 1O2 as a signal. In plants under stress, not only 1O2 but also other reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated simultaneously, thus making it difficult to link a particular response to the release of 1O2 and establish a signaling role for this ROS. This obstacle has been overcome by the identification of conditional mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana that selectively generate 1O2 and trigger various 1O2-mediated responses. In chloroplasts of these mutants, chlorophyll or its biosynthetic intermediates may act as a photosensitizer and generate 1O2. These 1O2-mediated responses are not only dependent on the dosage of 1O2 but also are determined by the timing and suborganellar localization of its production. This spatial- and temporal-dependent variability of 1O2-mediated responses emphasizes the importance of 1O2 as a highly versatile and short-lived signal that acts throughout the life cycle of a plant.
