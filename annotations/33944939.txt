Trichomes are potentially important for absorption of foliar fertilizers. A study has shown that the non-glandular trichromes (NGTs) of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) accumulated high concentrations of foliar-applied zinc (Zn); however, the mechanisms of Zn accumulation in the NGTs and the fate of this Zn are unclear. Here we investigated how foliar-applied Zn accumulates in the NGTs and the subsequent translocation of this Zn. Time-resolved synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy and transcriptional analyses were used to probe the movement of Zn in the NGTs, with the cuticle composition of the NGTs examined using confocal Raman microscopy. The accumulation of Zn in the NGTs is both an initial preferential absorption process and a subsequent translocation process. This preferred absorption is likely because the NGT base has a higher hydrophilicity, whilst the subsequent translocation is due to the presence of plasmodesmata, Zn-chelating ligands, and Zn transporters in the NGTs. Furthermore, the Zn sequestered in the NGTs was eventually translocated out of the trichome once the leaf Zn concentration had decreased, suggesting that the NGTs are also important in maintaining leaf Zn homeostasis. This study demonstrates for the first time that trichomes have a key structural and functional role in the absorption and translocation of foliar-applied Zn.
