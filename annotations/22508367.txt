['22508367', 'The functional characterization of novel transcription factors identified by  systematic analysis remains a major challenge due to insufficient data to  interpret their specific roles in signaling networks. Here we present a  DNA-binding sequence discovery method to in vitro identify a G-rich, 11-bp  DNA-binding motif of a novel potential transcription factor AtYY1, a zinc finger  protein in Arabidopsis, by using polymerase chain reaction-assisted in vitro  selection and surface plasmon resonance analysis. Further mutational analysis of  the conserved G bases of the potential motif confirmed that AtYY1 specifically  bound to these conserved G sites. Additionally, genome-wide target gene analysis  revealed that AtYY1 was involved in diverse cellular pathways, including glucose  metabolism, photosynthesis, phototropism, and stress response.', '2012 Jun', 'Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai)', '10.1093/abbs/gms020', 'Liu']
