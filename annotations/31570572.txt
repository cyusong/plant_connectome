Mexico is recognized as the center of origin and domestication of maize. Introduction of modern maize varieties (MVs) into Mexico raised concerns regarding the possible effects of gene flow from MVs into maize landraces (LRs) and their wild relatives (WRs), teosintes. However, after more than 60 y from the release of the first MVs, the impact of the sympatry with LRs and their WRs has not been explored with genetic data. In this work, we assessed changes in the genomes of 7 maize LRs and 2 WR subspecies from collections spanning over 70 y. We compared the genotypes obtained by genotyping by sequencing (GBS) for LRs and WRs before and after the adoption of MVs, and observed introgression from sympatric MVs into LRs and into the WR <i>Zea mays</i> ssp. <i>mexicana</i> sampled after the year 2000. We also found a decrease in the paired divergence index (<i>F</i><sub><i>ST</i></sub> ) between MV-LR and MV-WR over the same time frame. Moreover, we determined that LR genetic diversity increased after 2000, probably as a result of gene flow from MVs introduced in the 1990s. Our findings allowed us to identify ongoing changes in the domesticated and wild maize genetic pools, and concur with previous works that have evaluated short-term gene flow from MVs into LRs in other crops. Our approach represents a useful tool for tracking evolutionary change in wild and domesticated genetic resources, as well as for developing strategies for their conservation.
