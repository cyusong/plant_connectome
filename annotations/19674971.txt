Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is a cell death suppressor protein conserved across a variety of organisms. The Arabidopsis atbi1-1 plant is a mutant in which the C-terminal 6 amino acids of the expressed BI-1 protein have been replaced by T-DNA insertion. This mutant BI-1 protein (AtBI-CM) produced in Escherichia coli can no longer bind to calmodulin. A promoter-reporter assay demonstrated compartmentalized expression of BI-1 during hypersensitive response, introduced by the inoculation of Pseudomonas syringae possessing the avrRTP2 gene, Pst(avrRPT2). In addition, both BI-1 knockdown plants and atbi1-1 showed increased sensitivity to Pst(avrRPT2)-induced cell death. The results indicated that the loss of calmodulin binding reduces the cell death suppressor activity of BI-1 in planta.
