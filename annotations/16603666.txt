['16603666', 'Four genes of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) monosaccharide  transporter-like superfamily share significant homology with transporter genes  previously identified in the common ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum), a  model system for studies on salt tolerance of higher plants. These ice plant  transporters had been discussed as tonoplast proteins catalyzing the  inositol-dependent efflux of Na(+) ions from vacuoles. The subcellular  localization and the physiological role of the homologous proteins in the  glycophyte Arabidopsis were unclear. Here we describe Arabidopsis INOSITOL  TRANSPORTER4 (AtINT4), the first member of this subgroup of Arabidopsis  monosaccharide transporter-like transporters. Functional analyses of the protein  in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Xenopus laevis oocytes characterize this  protein as a highly specific H(+) symporter for myoinositol. These activities and  analyses of the subcellular localization of an AtINT4 fusion protein in  Arabidopsis and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) reveal that AtINT4 is located in the  plasma membrane. AtINT4 promoter-reporter gene plants demonstrate that AtINT4 is  strongly expressed in Arabidopsis pollen and phloem companion cells. The  potential physiological role of AtINT4 is discussed.', '2006 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.077123', 'Sauer']
