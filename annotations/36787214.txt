The root cap is a small tissue located at the tip of the root with critical functions for root growth. Present in nearly all vascular plants, the root cap protects the root meristem, influences soil penetration, and perceives and transmits environmental signals that are critical for root branching patterns. To perform these functions, the root cap must remain a relatively stable size and must integrate endogenous developmental pathways with environmental signals, yet how it does so is not clear. We previously showed that low pH conditions alter root cap development, and these changes are mediated by the NIN LIKE PROTEIN 7 (NLP7) transcription factor, a master regulator of nitrate signaling. Here we show that NLP7 integrates nitrate signaling with auxin pathways to regulate root cap development. We find that low nitrate conditions promote aberrant release of root cap cells in Arabidopsis. Nitrate deficiency impacts auxin pathways in the last layer of the root cap, and this is mediated in part by NLP7. Mutations in NLP7 abolish the auxin minimum in the last layer of the root cap and alter root cap expression of the auxin carriers PIN-LIKES 3 (PILS3) and PIN-FORMED 7 (PIN7) as well as transcription factors that regulate PIN expression. Together, our data reveal NLP7 as a link between endogenous auxin pathways and nitrate signaling in the root cap.
