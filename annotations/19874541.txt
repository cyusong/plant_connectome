['19874541', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) mediates resistance to abiotic stress and controls  developmental processes in plants. The group-A PP2Cs, of which ABI1 is the  prototypical member, are protein phosphatases that play critical roles as  negative regulators very early in ABA signal transduction. Because redundancy is  thought to limit the genetic dissection of early ABA signalling, to identify  redundant and early ABA signalling proteins, we pursued a proteomics approach. We  generated YFP-tagged ABI1 Arabidopsis expression lines and identified in vivo  ABI1-interacting proteins by mass-spectrometric analyses of ABI1 complexes. Known  ABA signalling components were isolated including SnRK2 protein kinases. We  confirm previous studies in yeast and now show that ABI1 interacts with the  ABA-signalling kinases OST1, SnRK2.2 and SnRK2.3 in plants. Interestingly, the  most robust in planta ABI1-interacting proteins in all LC-MS/MS experiments were  nine of the 14 PYR/PYL/RCAR proteins, which were recently reported as ABA-binding  signal transduction proteins, providing evidence for in vivo PYR/PYL/RCAR  interactions with ABI1 in Arabidopsis. ABI1-PYR1 interaction was stimulated  within 5 min of ABA treatment in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, in contrast, PYR1  and SnRK2.3 co-immunoprecipitated equally well in the presence and absence of  ABA. To investigate the biological relevance of the PYR/PYLs, we analysed  pyr1/pyl1/pyl2/pyl4 quadruple mutant plants and found strong insensitivities in  ABA-induced stomatal closure and ABA-inhibition of stomatal opening. These  findings demonstrate that ABI1 can interact with several PYR/PYL/RCAR family  members in Arabidopsis, that PYR1-ABI1 interaction is rapidly stimulated by ABA  in Arabidopsis and indicate new SnRK2 kinase-PYR/PYL/RCAR interactions in an  emerging model for PYR/PYL/RCAR-mediated ABA signalling.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04054.x', 'Schroeder']
