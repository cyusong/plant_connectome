Griffith <i>et al</i> do not question the quality of our analysis, but they question our results with respect to the definition of forest we employed. In our response, we explain why the differences we report result from a difference of technique and not of definition, and how anyone can adapt-as we did-our data set to any forest definition and tree cover threshold of interest.
