Riboswitches are RNA elements that sense metabolites and control gene expression. Recently, the yybP-ykoY riboswitches were found to sense manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) and regulate the expression of diverse genes. Here, we show that the leader RNA (a yybP-ykoY RNA) of yebN in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae also functions as a sensor of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. This leader RNA detects Mn<sup>2+</sup> levels in plants and is essential to X. oryzae pv. oryzae virulence. Our data also indicate that Mn<sup>2+</sup> is not only required as a microelement for plant growth but also acts as a defense molecule to inhibit pathogen growth. This finding highlights that Mn<sup>2+</sup> plays important roles in pathogen-plant interactions and that the yebN leader RNA can be a target candidate for anti-X. oryzae pv. oryzae drug development.
