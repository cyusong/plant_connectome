Soybean is one of the four major crops in China. The occurrence of viruses in soybean causes significant economic losses. In this study, the soybean leaves from stay-green plants showing crinkle were collected for metatranscriptomic sequencing. A novel geminivirus, tentatively named soybean geminivirus A (SGVA), was identified in soybean stay-green plants. Sequence analysis of the full-length SGVA genome revealed a genome of 2762 nucleotides that contain six open reading frames. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that SGVA was located adjacent to the clade of begomoviruses in both the full genome-based and C1-based phylogenetic tree, while in the CP-based phylogenetic tree, SGVA was located adjacent to the clade of becurtoviruses. SGVA was proposed as a new recombinant geminivirus. Agroinfectious clone of SGVA was constructed. Typical systemic symptoms of curly leaves were observed at 11 dpi in Nicotiana benthamiana plants and severe dwarfism was observed after 3 weeks post inoculation. Expression of the SGVA encoded V2 and C1 proteins through a potato virus X (PVX) vector caused severe symptoms in N. benthamiana. The V2 protein inhibited local RNA silencing in co-infiltration assays in GFP transgenic 16C N. benthamiana plants. Further study revealed mild symptoms in N. benthamiana plants inoculated with SGVA-ZZ <sub>V2-STOP</sub> and SGVA-ZZ <sub>V2-3738AA</sub> mutants. Both the relative viral DNA and CP protein accumulation levels significantly decreased when compared with SGVA-inoculated plants. This work identified a new geminivirus in soybean stay-green plants and determined V2 as a pathogenicity factor and silencing suppressor.
