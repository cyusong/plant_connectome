['11351099', 'Repetitive rounds of differential subtraction screening, followed by nucleotide  sequence determination and northern-blot analysis, identified 84 salt-regulated  (160 mM NaCl for 4 h) genes in Arabidopsis wild-type (Col-0 gl1) seedlings.  Probes corresponding to these 84 genes and ACP1, RD22BP1, MYB2, STZ, and PAL were  included in an analysis of salt responsive gene expression profiles in gl1 and  the salt-hypersensitive mutant sos3. Six of 89 genes were expressed  differentially in wild-type and sos3 seedlings; steady-state mRNA abundance of  five genes (AD06C08/unknown, AD05E05/vegetative storage protein 2 [VSP2],  AD05B11/S-adenosyl-L-Met:salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase [SAMT],  AD03D05/cold regulated 6.6/inducible2 [COR6.6/KIN2], and salt tolerance zinc  finger [STZ]) was induced and the abundance of one gene (AD05C10/circadian  rhythm-RNA binding1 [CCR1]) was reduced in wild-type plants after salt treatment.  The expression of CCR1, SAMT, COR6.6/KIN2, and STZ was higher in sos3 than in  wild type, and VSP2 and AD06C08/unknown was lower in the mutant. Salt-induced  expression of VSP2 in sos1 was similar to wild type, and AD06C08/unknown, CCR1,  SAMT, COR6.6/KIN2, and STZ were similar to sos3. VSP2 is regulated presumably by  SOS2/3 independent of SOS1, whereas the expression of the others is SOS1  dependent. AD06C08/unknown and VSP2 are postulated to be effectors of salt  tolerance whereas CCR1, SAMT, COR6.6/KIN2, and STZ are determinants that must be  negatively regulated during salt adaptation. The pivotal function of the SOS  signal pathway to mediate ion homeostasis and salt tolerance implicates  AD06C08/unknown, VSP2, SAMT, 6.6/KIN2, STZ, and CCR1 as determinates that are  involved in salt adaptation.', '2001 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.126.1.363', 'Hasegawa']
