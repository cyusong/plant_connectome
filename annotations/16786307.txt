['16786307', 'Through activation tagging mutagenesis, we isolated a kidari-D (kdr-D) mutant,  which exhibited a defect in blue and far-red light mediated photomorphogenesis.  Under continuous blue light, the kdr-D mutant showed long hypocotyl phenotype,  whereas it showed normal cotyledon opening and expansion. In addition, the kdr-D  showed slightly longer hypocotyl under continuous far-red light, suggesting that  KDR functions in a branch of cry signaling and mediates a cross-talk between cry  and phyA. In the kdr-D mutant, a gene encoding a putative basic/Helix-Loop-Helix  (bHLH) protein was overexpressed by the insertion of 35S enhancer into 10 kb  upstream of the gene. Consistently, overexpression of this gene recapitulated the  phenotype of kdr-D. KDR is composed of 94 amino acids with non-DNA binding HLH  domain, a structure found in human Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id-1) which  functions as a negative regulator of bHLH proteins through heterodimerization  with them. The KDR specifically interacted with HFR1, a bHLH protein regulating  photomorphogenesis, in yeast two hybrid assay and the kdr-D was epistatic to  35S::HFR1 in the hypocotyl phenotype. Thus, it shows that KDR functions as a  negative regulator of HFR1, similar to Id-1 in human. The KDR exhibited circadian  expression pattern with an increase during the day. Taken together, our results  suggest that KDR attenuates light mediated responses in day light condition  through inhibition of the activity of bHLH proteins involved in light signaling.', '2006 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-006-0010-2', 'Lee']
