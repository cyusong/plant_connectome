Drought is a complex stress which elicits a wide variety of plant responses. As such, genetic studies of drought are particularly difficult. Elucidation of the genetic basis of components contributing to drought tolerance is likely to be more tractable than that of overall drought tolerance. Certain of the traits which contribute to drought tolerance in plants and the high-throughput phenotyping techniques available to measure those traits are described in this paper. On the basis of the dynamic nature of drought, plant development, and the resulting stress response, the focus is on non-destructive imaging techniques which allow a temporal resolution and monitoring of the same plants throughout the experiment. Information on the physiological changes in response to drought over time is vital in order to identify and characterize different drought-tolerance mechanisms. High-throughput imaging provides a valuable new tool which allows the dissection of plant responses to drought into a series of component traits.
