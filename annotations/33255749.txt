Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted by plants as a consequence of their interaction with biotic and abiotic factors, and have a very important role in plant evolution. Floral VOCs are often involved in defense and pollinator attraction. These interactions often change rapidly over time, so a quick response to those changes is required. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, which regulate both genes and transcription factors, might trigger adaptive responses to these evolutionary pressures as well as regulating the rhythmic emission of VOCs through circadian clock regulation. In addition, transgenerational epigenetic effects and whole genome polyploidy could modify the generation of VOCs' profiles of offspring, contributing to long-term evolutionary shifts. In this article, we review the available knowledge about the mechanisms that may act as epigenetic regulators of the main VOC biosynthetic pathways, and their importance in plant evolution.
