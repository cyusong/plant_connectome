In order to explore the physiological mechanism of different yield of summer maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) hybrids with different growth duration, a field experiment was conducted to study the growth stage, leaf photosynthetic characteristics, dry matter accumulation (DMA), transport and distribution characteristics and yield of the early maturity hybrid Denghai 518 (DH518) and the mid-late maturity hybrid Denghai 605 (DH605) from 2017 to 2021. The results showed that the yield of DH605 was significantly higher than that of DH518. The growth period of DH518 was 7-10 days shorter and the days of the growth stage of the sowing-silking stage (R1) were 5-6 days shorter compared to that of DH605. The contribution to grain dry matter by leaf and stalk dry matter remobilization (DMRC) of DH518 was significantly higher than that of DH605. There was a significant negative correlation between pre-silking growth days and harvest index (HI). The <sup>13</sup>C distribution to grains of DH518 was significantly higher than that of DH605, and the HI and the corresponding contribution of HI to yield was also higher than that of DH605. The light and temperature resource use efficiency from silking to physiological maturity stage of DH605 was significantly higher than that of DH518. The yield per GDD of DH605 increased by 7.25% than that of DH518. At post-silking, the duration of higher leaf area index (DLAI) (>56 days) and active photosynthesis duration (APD) (>50 days) of DH605 were longer compared with that of DH518, and the average plant growth rate was 7.15% higher than that of DH518, which significantly increased the DMA of DH605. Therefore, the significant reduction of DH518 yield compared with DH605 was not due to the shortening of the growth stage of sowing-R1, but the lower light and temperature resource use efficiency from silking to physiological maturity stage.
