['16002616', 'Coordinated spacing and patterning of stomata allow efficient gas exchange  between plants and the atmosphere. Here we report that three ERECTA (ER)-family  leucine-rich repeat-receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) together control stomatal  patterning, with specific family members regulating the specification of stomatal  stem cell fate and the differentiation of guard cells. Loss-of-function mutations  in all three ER-family genes cause stomatal clustering. Genetic interactions with  a known stomatal patterning mutant too many mouths (tmm) revealed stoichiometric  epistasis and combination-specific neomorphism. Our findings suggest that the  negative regulation of ER-family RLKs by TMM, which is an LRR receptor-like  protein, is critical for proper stomatal differentiation.', '2005 Jul 8', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1109710', 'Torii']
