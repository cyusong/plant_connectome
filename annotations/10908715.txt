['10908715', 'The enzyme dehydrodolichyl diphosphate (dedol-PP) synthase is a  cis-prenyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of dedol-PP, the long-chain  polyprenyl diphosphate used as a precursor for the synthesis of dolichyl  phosphate. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a cDNA from  Arabidopsis thaliana encoding dedol-PP synthase. The identity of the cloned  enzyme was confirmed by functional complementation of a yeast mutant strain  defective in dedol-PP synthase activity together with the detection of high  levels of dedol-PP synthase activity in the transformed yeast mutant. The A.  thaliana dedol-PP synthase mRNA was detected at high levels in roots but was  hardly detected in flowers, leaves, stems and in A. thaliana suspension-cultured  cells.', '2000 Jul 21', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(00)01798-1', 'Ferrer']
