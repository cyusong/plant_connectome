Plant protease inhibitors (PIs) are a diverse group of proteins which have been intensely investigated due to their potential function in protecting plants against herbivorous insects by inhibiting digestive proteases. Although this mechanism has been well documented for a number of single PIs and their target enzymes, whether this mechanism protects plants in nature remains unclear. Moreover, many plants express a number of different PIs and it was unknown if these proteins work synergistically as defenses or if they also have other functions. We recently identified four serine PIs (SPI) of Solanum nigrum and demonstrated that they differ substantially in substrate specificity, accumulation patterns, and their effect against different natural herbivorous insects in field- and glasshouse experiments. These differences suggest that SPIs have at least partially diversified to provide protection against different attackers. Although we could not detect effects on plant development or growth when silencing SPIs, gene- and tissue-specific expression patterns suggest multiple functions in generative tissues, including a possible involvement in development.
