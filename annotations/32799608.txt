has attracted tremendous interest because of its high contents of glucomannan and starch. Very few genes regulating glucomannan and starch were reported in <i>Amorphophallus</i>. In this study, an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (<i>AGP</i>) gene that plays a significant role in plant starch synthesis was cloned from <i>Amorphophallus muelleri</i>. It was shown that it encoded a predicted protein containing a conserved plant ADP-Glucose-PP repeat domain and seven potential ligand-binding sites. The real-time quantitative PCR showed that <i>AmAGP</i> was most abundant in tubers, and it was positively correlated with starch content. Additionally, its influencers about temperature and exogenous plant hormone were also discussed, showing that <i>AmAGP</i> expressed highly in tubers under treatments using 25°C and IAA. Furthermore, starch content was closely related to <i>AmAGP</i> expression level, suggesting that <i>AmAGP</i> was involved in the regulation of starch synthesis in <i>A. muelleri</i>. Therefore, identifying the sequence of <i>AmAGP</i> and its expression pattern during tuber enlarging and the changes of its transcript levels in response to temperature and plant hormones would contribute to a better understanding of starch synthesis, and also providing a reference information for future preferable breeding for obtaining more starch or more glucomannan in <i>Amorphophallus</i>.
