['15960623', 'In the current studies, we examined sugar-inducible gene expression using the  Arabidopsis thaliana line sGsL, which carries luciferase (LUC) and  beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter genes under the control of a 210-bp promoter  derived from the sweet potato sporamin gene (Spo(min)). We isolated an enhancer  activation-tagged mutant of this line that showed high-level expression of LUC  and GUS under non-inducing low-sugar conditions. The Activator ofSpo(min)::LUC2  (ASML2) gene located close to the enhancer encodes a protein belonging to a  previously uncharacterized class of CCT (CONSTANS, CONSTANS-like, TOC1) domain  proteins. Overexpression of ASML2 cDNA in the sGsL line resulted in enhanced  expression of not only LUC and GUS reporters but also several endogenous  sugar-inducible genes, including Atbeta-Amy, ApL3, and VSP2. Transient  co-expression of 35S::ASML2 with the Spo(min)::LUC or Atbeta-Amy::LUC reporter in  protoplasts resulted in an approximately 2.4 or 5.6-fold transactivation of LUC  expression, respectively. Expression of ASML2 was high in reproductive organs,  and expression in seedlings was slightly enhanced by sugars, but not by abscisic  acid. These results suggest that ASML2 functions as a transcriptional activator  and regulates the expression of at least a subset of sugar-inducible genes.', '2005 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02439.x', 'Nakamura']
