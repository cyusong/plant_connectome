Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) induces various defence responses in seed plants, but for early plant lineages, information on the potential of jasmonates to elicit stress signalling and trigger physiological modifications is limited. The spikemoss Selaginella martensii was exposed to a range of MeJA concentrations (0, 10, 25, and 50 mM), and biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, photosynthetic rate (A), and stomatal conductance (gs) were continuously measured. In addition, changes in phytohormone concentrations and gene expression were studied. Enhancement of methanol, lipoxygenase pathway volatiles and linalool emissions, and reductions in A and gs, were MeJA dose-dependent. Before MeJA treatment, the concentration of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) was 7-fold higher than jasmonic acid (JA). MeJA treatment rapidly increased OPDA and JA concentrations (within 30 min), with the latter more responsive. Some genes involved in BVOC biosynthesis and OPDA-specific response were up-regulated at 30 min after MeJA spraying, whereas those in the JA signalling pathway were not affected. Although JA was synthesized in S. martensii, OPDA was prioritized as a signalling molecule upon MeJA application. MeJA inhibited primary and enhanced secondary metabolism; we propose that fast-emitted linalool could serve as a marker of elicitation of stress-induced metabolism in lycophytes.
