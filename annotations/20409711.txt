['20409711', 'DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification associated with gene silencing. In  Arabidopsis, DNA methylation is established by DOMAINS REARRANGED  METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2), which is targeted by small interfering RNAs through a  pathway termed RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Recently, RdDM was shown to  require intergenic noncoding (IGN) transcripts that are dependent on the Pol V  polymerase. These transcripts are proposed to function as scaffolds for the  recruitment of downstream RdDM proteins, including DRM2, to loci that produce  both siRNAs and IGN transcripts. However, the mechanism(s) through which Pol V is  targeted to specific genomic loci remains largely unknown. Through affinity  purification of two known RdDM components, DEFECTIVE IN RNA-DIRECTED DNA  METHYLATION 1 (DRD1) and DEFECTIVE IN MERISTEM SILENCING 3 (DMS3), we found that  they copurify with each other and with a novel protein, RNA-DIRECTED DNA  METHYLATION 1 (RDM1), forming a complex we term DDR. We also found that DRD1  copurified with Pol V subunits and that RDM1, like DRD1 and DMS3, is required for  the production of Pol V-dependent transcripts. These results suggest that the DDR  complex acts in RdDM at a step upstream of the recruitment or activation of Pol  V.', '2010 May 25', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2010.03.062', 'Jacobsen']
