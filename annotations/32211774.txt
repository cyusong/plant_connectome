Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) are progressively affecting vineyard longevity and productivity worldwide. To be able to understand and combat these diseases, we need a different concept of the signals exchanged between the grapevine and fungi than the well-studied pathogen-associated molecular pattern and effector concepts. We screened extracts from fungi associated with GTDs for their association with basal defence responses in suspension cells of grapevine. By activity-guided fractionation of the two selected extracts, O-methylmellein was identified as a candidate modulator of grapevine immunity. O-Methylmellein could not induce immune responses by itself (i.e. does not act as an elicitor), but could amplify some of the defence responses triggered by the bacterial elicitor flg22, such as the induction level of defence genes and actin remodelling. These findings show that Eutypa lata, exemplarily selected as an endophytic fungus linked with GTDs, can secrete compounds that act as amplifiers of basal immunity. Thus, in addition to elicitors that can trigger basal immunity, and effectors that down-modulate antibacterial basal immunity, once it had been activated, E. lata seems to secrete a third type of chemical signal that amplifies basal immunity and may play a role in the context of consortia of mutually competing microorganisms.
