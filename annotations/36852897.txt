The effect of crop domestication on photosynthetic productivity has been well-studied, but at present, none examines its impacts on leaf anatomy and, consequently, light use efficiency in cotton. We investigated leaf and vein anatomy traits, light use efficiency (LUE) and gas exchange in 26 wild and 30 domesticated genotypes of cotton grown under field conditions. The results showed that domestication resulted in a higher photosynthetic rate, higher stomatal conductance, and lower lamina mass per area. Higher LUE was underpinned by the thicker leaves, greater vein volume, elongated palisade and higher chlorophyll content, although there was no difference in the apparent quantum yield. The lower vein mass per area in domesticated genotypes contributed to the reduction of lamina mass per area, but there was no decrease in vein length per area. Our study suggests that domestication has triggered a considerable shift in physiological and anatomical traits to support the increase in LUE. This article is protected by copyright.
