The glycine-rich domain proteins (<i>GRDP</i>) have been functionally implicated in the cell wall structure, biotic, and abiotic stress responses. However, little is known about <i>GRDP</i> genes in female gametophyte development of <i>Arabidopsis</i>. This study shows that <i>GRDP2</i>, a <i>GRDP</i>, plays a crucial role in female gametophyte development. In <i>GRDP2</i> overexpression lines, <i>grdp2-3</i>, the embryo sacs were arrested at FG1 and no nucleus stages. Furthermore, callose staining shows that cell plate formation during megasporogenesis is disturbed in <i>grdp2-3</i>. In contrast, the pollen development is not affected in <i>grdp2-3</i>. The expression patterns of auxin-specific marker lines in female gametophytes showed that the auxin distribution and transport were significantly changed during megagametogenesis in <i>grdp2-3</i>. In addition, compared with the membrane-localized pattern of <i>PIN1</i>, <i>PIN2</i>, and <i>PIN7</i> in WT, the signals were detected in the cytoplasm in <i>grdp2-3</i>. Together, our data suggest that <i>GRDP2</i> plays an essential role in auxin-mediated female gametophyte development.
