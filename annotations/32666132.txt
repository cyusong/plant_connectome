Complete plastome sequence of Tropaeolum pentaphyllum revealed molecular markers, hotspots of nucleotide polymorphism, RNA editing sites and phylogenetic aspects Tropaeolaceae Juss. ex DC. comprises approximately 95 species across North and South Americas. Tropaeolum pentaphyllum Lam. is an unconventional and endangered species with occurrence in some countries of South America. Although this species presents nutritional, medicinal and ornamental uses, genetic studies involving natural populations or promising genotypes are practically non-existent. Here, we report the nucleotide sequence of T. pentaphyllum plastome. It represents the first complete plastome sequence of the family Tropaeolaceae to be fully sequenced and analyzed in detail. The sequencing data revealed that the T. pentaphyllum plastome is highly similar to the plastomes of other Brassicales. Notwithstanding, our analyses detected some specific features concerning events of IR expansion and structural changes in some genes such as matK, rpoA, and rpoC2. We also detected 251 SSR loci, nine hotspots of nucleotide polymorphism, and two specific RNA editing sites in the plastome of T. pentaphyllum. Moreover, plastid phylogenomic inference indicated a closed relationship between the families Tropaeolaceae and Akaniaceae, which formed a sister group to Moringaceae-Caricaceae. Finally, our data bring new molecular markers and evolutionary features to be applied in the natural population, germplasm collection, and genotype selection aiming conservation, genetic diversity evaluation, and exploitation of this endangered species.
