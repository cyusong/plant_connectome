['8664502', 'Two biotrophic parasites of the wild crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh,  are being used to explore the molecular basis and evolution of genotype-spcific  recognition and host defense. Genes for recognition of Peronospora parasitica  (downy mildew) are numerous in A. thaliana and located on four of the five  chromosomes as described previously. Genes for recognition of the closely related  parasite Albugo candida (white blister) are described here. In contrast to teh  former parasite, less than 15% of the host accessions tested were capable of  recognizing either of two isolates of A. candida. The geographic regions  represented by these accessions included countries in eastern and western Europe,  Asia, North America and Africa. Extensive collections from England and Germany  were required to identify examples of incompatible interactions. Phenotypic  variation among incompatible interactions included reduced blister formations of  complete lack of asexual reproduction by the parasite. Variation in the extent of  the host response was also observed. Three host genes for recognition of A.  candida (RAC), each associated with different interactions phenotypes, were  identified through inheritance studies with three accessions. One of these genes  at locus RAC1 appeared to be completely dominant, whereas the other two genes  were only partially dominant or recessive under certain conditions, possibly  including the effect of genetic background. One of the later two genes defined a  second locus RAC2. RAC1 was mapped to the top arm of chromosome 1 in the 1 cM  interval between RFLP markers M254 and M253.', '1995 Nov-Dec', 'Mol Plant Microbe Interact', '10.1094/mpmi-8-0916', 'Beynon']
