Plants have the regenerative ability to reconnect cut organs, which is physiologically important to survive severe tissue damage. The ability to reconnect organs is utilized as grafting to combine two different individuals. Callus formation at the graft junction facilitates organ attachment and vascular reconnection. While it is well documented that local wounding signals provoke callus formation, how callus formation is differentially regulated at each cut end remains elusive. Here, we report that callus formation activity is asymmetrical between the top and bottom cut ends and is regulated by differential auxin accumulation. Gene expression analyses revealed that cellular auxin response is preferentially upregulated in the top part of the graft. Disruption of polar auxin transport inhibited callus formation from the top, while external application of auxin was sufficient to induce callus formation from the bottom, suggesting that asymmetric auxin accumulation is responsible for active callus formation from the top end. We further found that the expression of a key regulator of callus formation, WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 13 (WOX13), is induced by auxin. The ectopic callus formation from the bottom end, which is triggered by locally supplemented auxin, requires WOX13 function, demonstrating that WOX13 plays a pivotal role in auxin-dependent callus formation. The asymmetric WOX13 expression is observed both in grafted petioles and incised inflorescence stems, underscoring the generality of our findings. We propose that efficient organ reconnection is achieved by a combination of local wounding stimuli and disrupted long-distance signaling.
