Tobacco target spot disease is caused by a ubiquitous soil-borne phytopathogen <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>; the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the effects of <i>R. solani</i> remain unclear. Deeper understanding of the functional responses to <i>R. solani</i> during host plant infection would help identify the molecular mechanisms essential for successful host invasion. In this study, we performed global transcriptional analysis of <i>R. solani</i> during various stages (12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h) of tobacco infection <i>via</i> an RNA sequencing method, while utilizing the pathosystem model <i>R. solani</i> AG3-tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> L.). After <i>R. solani</i> inoculation, the number of differentially expressed genes of <i>R. solani</i> differed at the various time points. Moreover, several gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways were unique in different infection stages, especially with respect to the genes involved in plant cell wall degradation and catalysis of biotransformation reactions, such as the pectin metabolic process and pectin catabolic process. The overexpressing-PD8 <i>N. benthamiana</i> plants enhanced the susceptibility to <i>R. solani.</i> In addition, we found that large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated in tobacco after infected by <i>R. solani</i>. <i>R. solani</i> encoding <i>FAD/NAD binding oxidoreductase</i> and <i>peroxidase gene</i> family to eliminating ROS and counteract oxidative stress. Moreover, <i>Perox3</i> was validated that can enhance the ability of scavenging ROS by co-injecting. Overall, our findings show that pectin-degrading enzymes and cytochrome P450 genes are critical for plant infection. These results provide comprehensive insights into <i>R. solani</i> AG3 transcriptome responses during tobacco invasion.
