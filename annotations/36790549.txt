Specific sound patterns can affect plant development. Plants are responsive to environmental stimuli such as sound. However, little is known about their sensory apparatus, mechanisms, and signaling pathways triggered by these stimuli. Thus, it is important to understand the effect of sounds on plants and their technological potential. This review addresses the effects of sounds on plants, the sensory elements inherent to sound detection by the cell, as well as the triggering of signaling pathways that culminate in plant responses. The importance of sound standardization for the study of phytoacoustics is demonstrated. Studies on the sounds emitted or reflected by plants, acoustic stress in plants, and recognition of some sound patterns by plants are also explored.
