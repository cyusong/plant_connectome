['23803743', 'The CULLIN family of E3 ubiquitin ligases are important regulators of plant  development and function. A newly identified class of CULLIN4-RING-E3 ligases  (CRL4s) interacts with substrate receptors referred to as DDB1-CUL4 ASSOCIATED  FACTORS (DCAFs) via a DDB1 linker protein. We have previously reported that the  WD40 protein WDR55 interacts with DDB1A and is thus a putative DCAF. Mutants of  WDR55 are embryo lethal, suggesting that a DDB1(WDR55) complex could regulate  embryo and endosperm development. Here we report that a weak allele homozygous  for wdr55 display pleiotropic phenotypes in the seedling and adult stages,  suggesting a novel regulatory role for WDR55 in vegetative development.', '2013 Sep', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.25347', 'Grini']
