The mechanism of exogenous Spd-induced Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> stress tolerance in cucumber was studied by proteomics and physiological analyses. Protein-protein interaction network revealed 13 key proteins involved in Spd-induced Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> stress resistance. Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> stress is one of the major reasons for secondary salinization that limits cucumber plant development in greenhouse. The conferred protective role of exogenous Spd on cucumber in response to Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> stress cues involves changes at the cellular and physiological levels. To investigate the molecular foundation of exogenous Spd in Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> stress tolerance, a proteomic approach was performed in our work. After a 9 days period of Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> stress and/or exogenous Spd, 71 differential protein spots were confidently identified. The resulting proteins were enriched in seven different categories of biological processes, including protein metabolism, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, ROS homeostasis and stress defense, cell wall related, transcription, others and unknown. Protein metabolism (31.2%), carbohydrate and energy metabolism (15.6%), ROS homeostasis and stress defense (32.5%) were the three largest functional categories in cucumber root and most of them were significantly increased by exogenous Spd. The Spd-responsive protein interaction network revealed 13 key proteins, whose accumulation changes could be critical for Spd-induced resistance; all 13 proteins were upregulated by Spd at transcriptional and protein levels in response to Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> stress. Furthermore, accumulation of antioxidant enzymes, non-enzymatic antioxidant and polyamines, along with reduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA, were detected after exogenous Spd application during Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> stress. The results of these proteomic and physiological analyses in cucumber root may facilitate a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> stress tolerance mediated by exogenous Spd.
