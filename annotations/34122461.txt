In lacustrine wetlands connected to rivers, the changes in flood regimes caused by hydrological projects lead to changes in the community traits of dominant macrophytes and, consequently, influence the structure and function of wetland vegetation. However, community trait responses of macrophytes to the timing and duration of flood disturbance have been rarely quantified. In 2011-2019, we investigated plant species diversity, density, and biomass in three dominant macrophyte communities (<i>Carex brevicuspis</i> C.B. Clarke, <i>Miscanthus sacchariflorus</i> (Maxim.) Hackel, and <i>Polygonum hydropiper</i> L.) through monthly field surveys in Dongting Lake wetlands. Partial least squares regressions were used to analyze how the variations in hydrological regimes affected plant community traits. Apparent inter-annual fluctuations in plant community traits were detected during 2011-2019. The species richness and Shannon index of diversity of <i>Miscanthus</i> and <i>Polygonum</i> communities increased, whereas the Shannon index of diversity of <i>Carex</i> community decreased. Variation in flooding had a greater effect on <i>Polygonum</i> and <i>Carex</i> community traits than on <i>Miscanthus</i> community traits. Flooding disturbed all plant communities, especially when the duration and timing varied. Shorter inundation periods caused the biomass of <i>Miscanthus</i> community to decline, and that of <i>Carex</i> and <i>Polygonum</i> communities to increase. Earlier flood recession caused the species richness and Shannon index of diversity of <i>Polygonum</i> and <i>Miscanthus</i> community to increase, and those of <i>Carex</i> community to decrease. These findings imply that shorter inundation durations and earlier flood recession generated by the operation of the Three Gorges Dam have changed the macrophyte growth pattern.

Flooding: !affects! Plant communities 
Shorter inundation: !causes! Miscanthus biomass to decline 
Earlier flood recession: !increases! Species richness and Shannon index of diversity of Polygonum and Miscanthus 
Earlier flood recession: !decreases! Species richness and Shannon index of diversity of Carex
