Plant fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases terminate the process of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in plastids by hydrolyzing the acyl-ACP intermediates, and determine the chain length and levels of free fatty acids. They are of interest due to their roles in fatty acid synthesis and their potential to modify plant seed oils through biotechnology. Fatty acyl-ACP thioesterases (FAT) are divided into two families, i.e., FATA and FATB, according to their amino acid sequence and substrate specificity. The high oil content in <i>Jatropha curcas</i> L. seed has attracted global attention due to its potential for the production of biodiesel. However, the detailed effects of <i>JcFATA</i> and <i>JcFATB</i> on fatty acid biosynthesis and plant growth and development are still unclear. In this study, we found that <i>JcFATB</i> transcripts were detected in all tissues and organs examined, with especially high accumulation in the roots, leaves, flowers, and some stages of developing seeds, and <i>JcFATA</i> showed a very similar expression pattern. Subcellular localization of the JcFATA-GFP and JcFATB-GFP fusion protein in <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaf protoplasts showed that both JcFATA and JcFATB localized in chloroplasts. Heterologous expression of <i>JcFATA</i> and <i>JcFATB</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> individually generated transgenic plants with longer roots, stems and siliques, larger rosette leaves, and bigger seeds compared with those of the wild type, indicating the overall promotion effects of <i>JcFATA</i> and <i>JcFATB</i> on plant growth and development while <i>JcFATB</i> had a larger impact. Compositional analysis of seed oil revealed that all fatty acids except 22:0 were significantly increased in the mature seeds of <i>JcFATA</i>-transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines, especially unsaturated fatty acids, such as the predominant fatty acids of seed oil, 18:1, 18:2, and 18:3. In the mature seeds of the <i>JcFATB</i>-transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines, most fatty acids were increased compared with those in wild type too, especially saturated fatty acids, such as 16:0, 18:0, 20:0, and 22:0. Our results demonstrated the promotion effect of <i>JcFATA</i> and <i>JcFATB</i> on plant growth and development, and their possible utilization to modify the seed oil composition and content in higher plants.
