Pathogens utilize a repertoire of effectors to facilitate pathogenesis, but when the host recognizes one of them, it causes effector-triggered immunity. The <i>Pseudomonas</i> type III effector AvrRps4 is a bipartite effector that is processed in planta into a functional 133-amino acid N-terminus (AvrRps4-N) and 88-amino acid C-terminus (AvrRps4-C). Previous studies found AvrRps4-C to be sufficient to trigger the hypersensitive response (HR) in turnip. In contrast, our recent work found that AvrRps4-N but not AvrRps4-C triggered HR in lettuce, whereas both were required for resistance induction in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Here, we initially compared AvrRps4 recognition by turnip and lettuce using transient expression. By serial truncation, we identified the central conserved region consisting of 37 amino acids as essential for AvrRps4-N recognition, whereas the putative type III secretion signal peptide or the C-terminal 13 amino acids were dispensable. Surprisingly, the conserved arginine at position 112 (R112) that is required for full-length AvrRps4 processing is also required for the recognition of AvrRps4-N by lettuce. Mutating R112 to hydrophobic leucine or negatively charged glutamate abolished the HR-inducing capacity of AvrRps4-N, while a positively charged lysine at this position resulted in a slow and weak HR. Together, our results suggest an AvrRps4-N recognition-specific role of R112 in lettuce.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
