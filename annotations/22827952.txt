Light is one of the most important environmental signal for plants. Involvement of hormones, such as gibberellic acid, in light regulated development has been known for many years, though the molecular mechanisms remain still largely unknown. To shed light on possible interactions between phyto-hormones and photoperceptive photoreceptors of tomato, in a recent work we investigated the molecular effects of exogenous gibberellin to cryptochrome and phytochrome transcripts in wild type tomato as well as in a mutant genotype with a non-functional cryptochrome 1a and in a transgenic line overexpressing cryptochrome 2. Results highlight that following addition of gibberellin, cryptochrome and phytochrome transcription patterns are strongly modified, especially in cryptochrome 1a deficient plants. Our results suggest that cryptochrome mediated light responses can be modulated by gibberellin accumulation level, in tomato plants.
