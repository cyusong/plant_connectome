['12354106', 'The present study reports the first purification and kinetic characterization of  two plant arogenate dehydrogenases (EC 1.3.1.43), an enzyme that catalyses the  oxidative decarboxylation of arogenate into tyrosine in presence of NADP. The two  Arabidopsis thaliana arogenate dehydrogenases TyrAAT1 and TyrAAT2 were  overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Biochemical  comparison of the two forms revealed that at low substrate concentration TyrAAT1  is four times more efficient in catalyzing the arogenate dehydrogenase reaction  than TyrAAT2. Moreover, TyrAAT2 presents a weak prephenate dehydrogenase activity  whereas TyrAAT1 does not. The mechanism of the dehydrogenase reaction catalyzed  by these two forms has been investigated using steady-state kinetics. For both  enzymes, steady-state velocity patterns are consistent with a rapid equilibrium,  random mechanism in which two dead-end complexes, E-NADPH-arogenate and  E-NADP-tyrosine, are formed.', '2002 Oct', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03172.x', 'Matringe']
