The allocation patterns of foliar phosphorus (P) fractions across various vegetation types generally reflect the adaptability to P-impoverished environments. However, the allocation of foliar-P fractions within the desert herb <i>Karelinia caspia</i> (<i>K. caspica</i>) and shrub <i>Tamarix ramosissima</i> (<i>T. ramosissima</i>) in soils with different environment-P availability and the impact of soil and groundwater properties on foliar-P fractions allocation remain unclear. The foliar-P fractions (metabolites-P, nucleic acid-P, structural-P, and residual-P) of <i>K. caspica</i> and <i>T. ramosissima</i> and the properties of 0-60 cm deep soil under their canopy and groundwater were determined at four different environment-P sites. Results found that as environment-P availability decreased, both plants allocated the higher proportions of foliar-P to nucleic acid-P than to metabolites-P and structural-P. With the exception of residual-P, foliar-P fractions were markedly higher for <i>K. caspica</i> than <i>T. ramosissima</i>. Soil Olsen-P, NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>-N, soil water content, electrical conductivity (EC), groundwater EC, and total dissolved solids (TDSs) played an important role in allocating foliar P-fractions for both <i>K. caspica</i> and <i>T. ramosissima</i>. Compared with <i>K. caspica</i>, the foliar-P fractions of <i>T. ramosissima</i> were more tightly bounded to groundwater than soil properties. Overall, these findings show how desert plants flexibility take advantage of the foliar-P in low environment-P availability and illustrate the foliar-P fractions allocation of desert plants is driven by soil and groundwater properties.
