Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are highly conserved signal transduction modules, which transmit environmental signals in plant cells through stepwise phosphorylation and play indispensable roles in a wide range of physiological and biochemical processes. Here, we isolated and characterized a gene encoding MKK2 protein from poplar through the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length <i>PeMKK2a</i> gene was 1571 bp, including a 1068 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 355 amino acids, and the putative PeMKK2a protein belongs to the PKc_like (protein kinase domain) family (70-336 amino acids) in the PKc_MAPKK_plant subfamily and contains 62 sites of possible phosphorylation and two conserved domains, DLK and S/T-xxxxx-S/T. Detailed information about its gene structure, sequence similarities, subcellular localization, and transcript profiles under salt-stress conditions was revealed. Transgenic poplar lines overexpressing <i>PeMKK2a</i> exhibited higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) than non-transgenic poplar under salt stress conditions. These results will provide insight into the roles of MAPK signaling cascades in poplar response to salt stress.
