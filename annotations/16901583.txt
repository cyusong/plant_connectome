Treatment of Silybum marianum cell cultures with methyl jasmonate elicits the production of the antihepatotoxic drug silymarin and its release into the culture medium. In this work, we investigated the involvement of peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.7; donor hydrogen peroxidase oxido-reductase) in silymarin turnover in cell cultures as well as the influence of elicitation on the activity towards several substrates. Peroxidases from cell extracts and, to a higher degree from the spent medium, used the silymarin precursors taxifolin and coniferyl alcohol as substrates. Silymarin compounds were also degraded by suspension culture peroxidases; however, the oxidation efficiency was not modified by elicitation. S. marianum peroxidases were able to catalyse the oxidative coupling of taxifolin and coniferyl alcohol to silybinins. The synthetic activity was mainly associated with the extracellular compartment and as before, methyl jasmonate did not modify oxidative coupling activity. Changes in the isoenzyme profiles were not observed in elicited cultures.

Peroxidases: !oxidatively couple! taxifolin and coniferyl alcohol to silybinins
Methyl jasmonate: !elicits! production of silymarin
Methyl jasmonate: !does not modify! oxidative coupling activity
