Conclusions 1233 Acknowledgements 1233 References 1233 SUMMARY: To deal with the ever-changing environment, sessile plants adapt diverse and plastic organ structures during postembryonic development. Among these, the apical hook forms shortly after seed germination of most dicots, and protects the delicate shoot meristem from mechanical damage during soil emergence. For decades, this structure has been taken as an excellent model for the investigation of the mechanisms underlying the differential growth of plant tissues. Here, we summarize recent advances in the investigation of the hormonal regulation of apical hook development, focusing on the convergence to auxin and a central regulator HOOKLESS1 (HLS1). We propose the revisitation of hook curvature kinematics at suborgan and single-cell resolution, and further pursuance of the mechanistics of apical hook development through combinatorial approaches of automated imaging and multidimensional modeling.
