Intertidal macroalgae Fucus and Laminaria experience seasonally fluctuating inorganic N supply. This study examined the effects of long-term N deprivation, recovery following N resupply, and effects of elevated ammonium and nitrate exposure on N acquisition in intertidal algae using manipulations of N supply in tank culture. Over 15 weeks of N deprivation, internal N and nitrate reductase activity (NRA) declined, but maximum quantum yield of PSII was unaffected in Fucus serratus and Fucus vesiculosus. Low NRA was maintained despite no external nitrate availability and depletion of internal pools, suggesting a constitutive NRA, insensitive to N supply. Nitrate resupplied to N-starved thalli was rapidly taken up and internal nitrate pools and NRA increased. Exposure to elevated (50 microM) nitrate over 4 days stimulated nitrate uptake and NRA in Laminaria digitata and F. serratus. Exposure to elevated ammonium suppressed NRA in L. digitata but not in F. serratus. This novel insensitivity of NRA to ammonium in Fucus contrasts with regulation of NRA in other algae and higher plants. Ammonium suppression of NRA in L. digitata was not via inhibition of nitrate uptake and was independent of nitrate availability. L. digitata showed a higher capacity for internal nitrate storage when exposed to elevated ambient nitrate, but NRA was lower than in Fucus. All species maintained nitrate assimilation capacity in excess of nitrate uptake capacity. N uptake and storage strategies of these intertidal macroalgae are adaptive to life in fluctuating N supply, and distinct regulation of N metabolism in Fucus vs Laminaria may relate to position in the intertidal zone.
