['27109472', 'The plant seeds formation are crucial parts in reproductive process in seed  plants as well as food source for humans. Proper embryo development ensure viable  seed formation. Here, we showed an Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant slow embryo  development1 (sed1) which exhibited retarded embryogenesis, led to aborted seeds.  Embryo without SED1 developed slower compared to normal one and could be  recognized at early globular stage by its white appearance. In later development  stage, storage accumulated poorly with less protein and lipid body production.  In vitro culture did not rescue albino embryo. SED1 encoded a protein targeted to  mitochondria. Transmission electron microscopic analysis revealed that  mitochondria developed abnormally, and more strikingly plastid failed to  construct grana in time in sed1/sed1 embryo. These data indicated that SED1 is  indispensable for embryogenesis in Arabidopsis, and the mitochondria may be  involved in the regulation of many aspects of seed development.', '2016 May 27', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.04.114', 'Sodmergen']
