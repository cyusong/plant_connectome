Plant viruses typically cause severe pathogenicity in plants, even resulting in the death of plants. Many pathogenic plant viruses are transmitted in a persistent manner via insect vectors. Interestingly, unlike in the plant hosts, persistent viruses are either nonpathogenic or show limited pathogenicity in their insect vectors, while taking advantage of the cellular machinery of insect vectors for completing their life cycles. This review discusses why persistent plant viruses are nonpathogenic or have limited pathogenicity to their insect vectors while being pathogenic to plants hosts. Current advances in cell biology of virus-insect vector interactions are summarized, including virus-induced inclusion bodies, changes of insect cellular ultrastructure, and immune response of insects to the viruses, especially autophagy and apoptosis. The corresponding findings of virus-plant interactions are compared. An integrated view of the balance strategy achieved by the interaction between viral attack and the immune response of insect is presented. Finally, we outline progress gaps between virus-insect and virus-plant interactions, thus highlighting the contributions of cultured cells to the cell biology of virus-insect interactions. Furthermore, future prospects of studying the cell biology of virus-vector interactions are presented.
