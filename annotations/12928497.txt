['12928497', 'Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous multifunctional calcium sensor in all eukaryotes,  mediates calcium action by regulating the activity/function of many unrelated  proteins. Although calcium and CaM are known to play a crucial role in pollen  germination and pollen tube growth, the proteins that mediate their action have  not been identified. We isolated three closely related CaM-binding proteins  (NPG1, NPGR1, and NPGR2) from Arabidopsis. NPG1 (No Pollen Germination1) is  expressed only in pollen, whereas the NPG-related proteins (NPGR1 and NPGR2) are  expressed in pollen and other tissues. The bacterially expressed NPG1 bound three  isoforms of Arabidopsis CaM in a calcium-dependent manner. To analyze the  function of NPG1, we performed a reverse genetics screen and isolated a mutant in  which NPG1 is disrupted by a T-DNA insertion. Segregation and molecular analyses  of the NPG1 knockout mutant and a cross with a male sterile mutant indicate that  the mutated NPG1 is not transmitted through the male gametophyte. Expression of  NPG1 in the knockout mutant complemented the mutant phenotype. Analysis of pollen  development in the knockout mutant by light microscopy showed normal pollen  development. Pollen from NPG1 mutant in the quartet background has confirmed that  NPG1 is dispensable for pollen development. However, germination studies with  pollen from the mutant in the quartet background indicate that pollen carrying a  mutant allele does not germinate. Our genetic, histological, and pollen  germination studies with the knockout mutant line indicate that NPG1 is not  necessary for microsporogenesis and gametogenesis but is essential for pollen  germination.', '2003 Sep 2', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1734110100', 'Reddy']
