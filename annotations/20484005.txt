['20484005', 'Tudor-SN (TSN) copurifies with the RNA-induced silencing complex in animal cells  where, among other functions, it is thought to act on mRNA stability via the  degradation of specific dsRNA templates. In plants, TSN has been identified  biochemically as a cytoskeleton-associated RNA binding activity. In eukaryotes,  it has recently been identified as a conserved primary target of programmed cell  death-associated proteolysis. We have investigated the physiological role of TSN  by isolating null mutations for two homologous genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The  double mutant tsn1 tsn2 displays only mild growth phenotypes under nonstress  conditions, but germination, growth, and survival are severely affected under  high salinity stress. Either TSN1 or TSN2 alone can complement the double mutant,  indicating their functional redundancy. TSN accumulates heterogeneously in the  cytosol and relocates transiently to a diffuse pattern in response to salt  stress. Unexpectedly, stress-regulated mRNAs encoding secreted proteins are  significantly enriched among the transcripts that are underrepresented in tsn1  tsn2. Our data also reveal that TSN is important for RNA stability of its  targets. These findings show that TSN is essential for stress tolerance in plants  and implicate TSN in new, potentially conserved mechanisms acting on mRNAs  entering the secretory pathway.', '2010 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.070680', 'Bianchi']
