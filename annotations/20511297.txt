['20511297', 'Here, we characterize a plastidial thioredoxin (TRX) isoform from Arabidopsis  thaliana that defines a previously unknown branch of plastidial TRXs lying  between x- and y-type TRXs and thus was named TRX z. An Arabidopsis knockout  mutant of TRX z had a severe albino phenotype and was inhibited in chloroplast  development. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of the mutant suggested that  the expressions of genes that depend on a plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP)  were specifically decreased. Similar results were obtained upon virus-induced  gene silencing (VIGS) of the TRX z ortholog in Nicotiana benthamiana. We found  that two fructokinase-like proteins (FLN1 and FLN2), members of the  pfkB-carbohydrate kinase family, were potential TRX z target proteins and  identified conserved Cys residues mediating the FLN-TRX z interaction. VIGS in N.  benthamiana and inducible RNA interference in Arabidopsis of FLNs also led to a  repression of PEP-dependent gene transcription. Remarkably, recombinant FLNs  displayed no detectable sugar-phosphorylating activity, and amino acid  substitutions within the predicted active site imply that the FLNs have acquired  a new function, which might be regulatory rather than metabolic. We were able to  show that the FLN2 redox state changes in vivo during light/dark transitions and  that this change is mediated by TRX z. Taken together, our data strongly suggest  an important role for TRX z and both FLNs in the regulation of PEP-dependent  transcription in chloroplasts.', '2010 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.071001', 'Bornke']
