['27002025', 'Drought stress induces stomatal closure and inhibits stomatal opening  simultaneously. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still largely  unknown. Here we show that S-type anion channels SLAC1 and SLAH3 mainly inhibit  inward K+ (K+in) channel KAT1 by protein-protein interaction, and consequently  prevent stomatal opening in Arabidopsis. Voltage-clamp results demonstrated that  SLAC1 inhibited KAT1 dramatically, but did not inhibit KAT2. SLAH3 inhibited KAT1  to a weaker degree relative to SLAC1. Both the N terminus and the C terminuses of  SLAC1 inhibited KAT1, but the inhibition by the N terminus was stronger. The C  terminus was essential for the inhibition of KAT1 by SLAC1. Furthermore, drought  stress strongly up-regulated the expression of SLAC1 and SLAH3 in Arabidopsis  guard cells, and the over-expression of wild type and truncated SLAC1  dramatically impaired K+in currents of guard cells and light-induced stomatal  opening. Additionally, the inhibition of KAT1 by SLAC1 and KC1 only partially  overlapped, suggesting that SLAC1 and KC1 inhibited K+in channels using different  molecular mechanisms. Taken together, we discovered a novel regulatory mechanism  for stomatal movement, in which singling pathways for stomatal closure and  opening are directly coupled together by protein-protein interaction between  SLAC1/SLAH3 and KAT1 in Arabidopsis.', '2016 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.01050', 'Wang']
