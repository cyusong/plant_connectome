Soil water transported via the petiole is a primary rehydration pathway for leaves of water-stressed plants. Leaves may also rehydrate by absorbing water via their epidermal surfaces. The mechanisms and physiological relevance of this water pathway, however, remain unclear, as the associated hydraulic properties are unknown. To gain insight into the foliar water absorption process, we compared rehydration kinetics via the petiole and surface of Prunus dulcis and Quercus lobata leaves. Petiole rehydration could be described by a double exponential function suggesting that 2 partly isolated water pools exist in leaves of both species. Surface rehydration could be described by a logistic function, suggesting that leaves behave as a single water pool. Whereas full leaf rehydration via the petiole required approximately 20 min, it took over 150 and 300 min via the surface of P. dulcis and Q. lobata, respectively. Such differences were attributed to the high resistance imposed by the leaf surface and especially the cuticle. The minimum resistance to surface rehydration was estimated to be 6.6 × 10<sup>2</sup> (P. dulcis) and 2.6 × 10<sup>3</sup>  MPa·m<sup>2</sup> ·s·g<sup>-1</sup> (Q. lobata), which is remarkably higher than estimated for petiole rehydration. These results are discussed in a physiological context.
