The presence of 2 mM bicarbonate in the incubation medium induced stomatal closure in abaxial epidermis of Arabidopsis. Exposure to 2 mM bicarbonate elevated the levels of H(2)O(2) in guard cells within 5 min, as indicated by the fluorescent probe, dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCF-DA). Bicarbonate-induced stomatal closure as well as H(2)O(2) production were restricted by exogenous catalase or diphenylene iodonium (DPI, an inhibitor of NAD(P)H oxidase). The reduced sensitivity of stomata to bicarbonate and H(2)O(2) production in homozygous atrbohD/F double mutant of Arabidopsis confirmed that NADP(H) oxidase is involved during bicarbonate induced ROS production in guard cells. The production of H(2)O(2) was quicker and greater with ABA than that with bicarbonate. Such pattern of H(2)O(2) production may be one of the reasons for ABA being more effective than bicarbonate, in promoting stomatal closure. Our results demonstrate that H(2)O(2) is an essential secondary messenger during bicarbonate induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis.

Bicarbonate: !induces! H2O2 production 
H2O2: !promotes! stomatal closure 
NADPH oxidase: !mediates! bicarbonate-induced ROS production 
ABA: !produces! quicker, greater H2O2 production
