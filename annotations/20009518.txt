The activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway in plants by environmental stimuli is one of the most universal biochemical stress responses known. In tomato plant, rubbing applied to a young internode inhibit elongation of the rubbed internode and his neighboring one. These morphological changes were correlated with an increase in lignification enzyme activities, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidases (POD), 24 hours after rubbing of the forth internode. Furthermore, a decrease in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content was detected in the rubbed internode and the upper one. Taken together, our results suggest that decrease in rubbed internode length is a consequence of IAA oxidation, increases in enzyme activities (PAL, CAD and POD), and cell wall rigidification associated with induction of lignification process.

rubbing: !inhibits! elongation 
PAL, CAD, POD: !increase! 24 hours after rubbing 
IAA: !decreases! in rubbed internode 
IAA: !oxidizes! decrease in rubbed internode length 
enzyme activities: !induce! cell wall rigidification 
lignification process: !enhances! cell wall rigidification
