Plants under conditions of essential mineral deficiency trigger signaling mechanisms that involve common components. Among these components, nitric oxide (NO) has been identified as a key participant in responses to changes in nutrient availability. Usually, nutrient imbalances affect the levels of NO in specific plant tissues, via modification of its rate of synthesis or degradation. Changes in the level of NO affect plant morphology and/or trigger responses associated with nutrient homeostasis, mediated by its interaction with reactive oxygen species, phytohormones, and through post-translational modification of proteins. NO-related events constitute an exciting field of research to understand how plants adapt and respond to conditions of nutrient shortage. This review summarizes the current knowledge on NO as a component of the multiple processes related to plant performance under conditions of deficiency in mineral nutrients, focusing on macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, and magnesium, as well as micronutrients such as iron and zinc.
