In agricultural soils, amino acids can represent vital nitrogen (N) sources for crop growth and yield. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying amino acid uptake and allocation are poorly understood in crop plants. This study shows that rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots can acquire aspartate at soil concentration, and that japonica subspecies take up this acidic amino acid 1.5-fold more efficiently than indica subspecies. Genetic association analyses with 68 representative japonica or indica germplasms identified rice Lysine-Histidine-type Transporter 1 (OsLHT1) as a candidate gene associated with the aspartate uptake trait. When expressed in yeast, OsLHT1 supported cell growth on a broad spectrum of amino acids, and effectively transported aspartate, asparagine and glutamate. OsLHT1 is localized throughout the rice root, including root hairs, epidermis, cortex and stele, and to the leaf vasculature. Knockout of OsLHT1 in japonica resulted in reduced root uptake of amino acids. Furthermore, in <sup>15</sup> N-amino acid-fed mutants versus wild-type, a higher percentage of <sup>15</sup> N remained in roots instead of being allocated to the shoot. <sup>15</sup> N-ammonium uptake and subsequently the delivery of root-synthesized amino acids to Oslht1 shoots were also significantly decreased, which was accompanied by reduced shoot growth. These results together provide evidence that OsLHT1 functions in both root uptake and root to shoot allocation of a broad spectrum of amino acids in rice.
