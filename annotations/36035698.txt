Proper timing of flowering, a phase transition from vegetative to reproductive development, is crucial for plant fitness. The floral repressor <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) is the major determinant of flowering in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. In rapid-cycling <i>A. thaliana</i> accessions, which bloom rapidly, <i>FLC</i> is constitutively repressed by autonomous pathway (AP) genes, regardless of photoperiod. Diverse AP genes have been identified over the past two decades, and most of them repress <i>FLC</i> through histone modifications. However, the detailed mechanism underlying such modifications remains unclear. Several recent studies have revealed novel mechanisms to control <i>FLC</i> repression in concert with histone modifications. This review summarizes the latest advances in understanding the novel mechanisms by which AP proteins regulate <i>FLC</i> repression, including changes in chromatin architecture, RNA polymerase pausing, and liquid-liquid phase separation- and ncRNA-mediated gene silencing. Furthermore, we discuss how each mechanism is coupled with histone modifications in <i>FLC</i> chromatin.
