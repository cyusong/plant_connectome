['17425712', 'Pectins are a family of complex cell-wall polysaccharides, the biosynthesis of  which remains poorly understood. We identified dwarf mutants with reduced cell  adhesion at a novel locus, QUASIMODO2 (QUA2). qua2-1 showed a 50% reduction in  homogalacturonan (HG) content compared with the wild type, without affecting  other cell-wall polysaccharides. The remaining HG in qua2-1 showed an unaltered  degree of methylesterification. Positional cloning and GFP fusions showed that  QUA2, consistent with a role in HG synthesis, encodes a Golgi-localized protein.  In contrast to QUA1, another Golgi-localized protein required for HG-synthesis,  QUA2 does not show sequence similarity to glycosyltransferases, but instead  contains a putative methyltransferase (MT) domain. The Arabidopsis genome encodes  29 QUA2-related proteins. Interestingly, the transcript profiles of QUA1 and QUA2  are correlated and other pairs of QUA1 and QUA2 homologues with correlated  transcript profiles can be identified. Together, the results lead to the  hypothesis that QUA2 is a pectin MT, and that polymerization and methylation of  homogalacturonan are interdependent reactions.', '2007 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03086.x', 'Hofte']
