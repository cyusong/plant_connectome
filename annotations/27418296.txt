Retention or loss of paralogs following duplication correlates strongly with the function of the gene and whether the gene was duplicated by whole-genome duplication (WGD) or by small-scale duplication. Selection on relative gene dosage (to maintain proper stoichiometry among interacting proteins) has been invoked to explain these patterns of duplicate gene retention and loss. In order for gene dosage to be visible to natural selection, there must necessarily be a correlation between gene copy number and gene expression level (transcript abundance), but this has rarely been examined. We used RNA-Seq data from seven Glycine subgenus Glycine species (three recently formed allotetraploids and their four diploid progenitors) to determine if expression patterns and gene dosage responses at the level of transcription are consistent with selection on relative gene dosage. As predicted, metabolic pathways and gene ontologies that are putatively dosage-sensitive based on duplication history exhibited reduced expression variance across species, and more coordinated expression responses to recent WGD, relative to putatively dosage-insensitive networks. We conclude that selection on relative dosage has played an important role in shaping gene networks in Glycine.
