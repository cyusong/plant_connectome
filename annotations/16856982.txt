['16856982', "Using activation tagging in the Arabidopsis Col-0 rps2-101C background, we  identified a mutant (FMO1-3D) that showed virtually no symptoms after inoculation  with virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 bacteria. The dominant,  gain-of-function phenotype of the FMO1-3D mutant is due to over-expression of a  class 3 flavin-containing mono-oxygenase (FMO). We recapitulated the FMO1-3D  mutant phenotype in independent transgenic Col-0 lines over-expressing the FMO1  cDNA under the control of the 35S CaMV promoter. The increased basal resistance  observed in the FMO1-3D mutant was also effective against the taxonomically  unrelated downy mildew-causing pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica. By  investigating the progeny from crosses of the FMO1-3D mutant with the NahG  transgenic line, we showed that the enhanced basal resistance phenotype was  dependent on the accumulation of salicylic acid. FMO1-3D plants showed wild-type  resistant reactions after inoculation with avirulent bacteria, indicating that  the R-gene-mediated defence physiology was not compromised by FMO1  over-expression. Transcripts of the class 3 FMO1 gene accumulated within 6 h  after inoculation of wild-type Col-0 plants with avirulent Pst + avrRpt2 cells.  Moreover, a T-DNA insertion into the FMO1 gene resulted in enhanced  susceptibility to virulent Pseudomonas and Hyaloperonospora parasitica,  suggesting that expression of the FMO1 gene is a hitherto undescribed component  of the plant's resistance repertoire. We discuss the possibility that the FMO may  participate in the detoxification of virulence factors produced by pathogens.", '2006 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02813.x', 'Schlaich']
