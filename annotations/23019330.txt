['23019330', 'In this study, we investigated which enzymes are involved in debranching  amylopectin during transient starch degradation. Previous studies identified two  debranching enzymes, isoamylase 3 (ISA3) and limit dextrinase (LDA), involved in  this process. However, plants lacking both enzymes still degrade substantial  amounts of starch. Thus, other enzymes/mechanisms must contribute to starch  breakdown. We show that the chloroplastic alpha-amylase 3 (AMY3) also participates in  starch degradation and provide evidence that all three enzymes can act directly  at the starch granule surface. The isa3 mutant has a starch excess phenotype,  reflecting impaired starch breakdown. In contrast, removal of AMY3, LDA, or both  enzymes together has no impact on starch degradation. However, removal of AMY3 or  LDA in addition to ISA3 enhances the starch excess phenotype. In plants lacking  all three enzymes, starch breakdown is effectively blocked, and starch  accumulates to the highest levels observed so far. This provides indirect  evidence that the heteromultimeric debranching enzyme ISA1-ISA2 is not involved  in starch breakdown. However, we illustrate that ISA1-ISA2 can hydrolyze small  soluble branched glucans that accumulate when ISA3 and LDA are missing, albeit at  a slow rate. Starch accumulation in the mutants correlates inversely with plant  growth.', '2012 Dec 7', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M112.395244', 'Zeeman']
