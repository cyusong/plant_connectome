Molecular identification of species is especially important where traditional taxonomic methods fail. The genus <i>Calypogeia</i> belongs to one of the tricky taxons. The simple morphology of these species and a tendency towards environmental plasticity make them complicated in identification. The finding of the universal single-locus DNA barcode in plants seems to be 'the Holy Grail'; therefore, researchers are increasingly looking for multiloci DNA barcodes or super-barcoding. Since the mitochondrial genome has low sequence variation in plants, species delimitation is usually based on the chloroplast genome. Unexpectedly, our research shows that super-mitobarcoding can also work! However, our outcomes showed that a single method of molecular species delimitation should be avoided. Moreover, it is recommended to interpret the results of molecular species delimitation alongside other types of evidence, such as ecology, population genetics or comparative morphology. Here, we also presented genetic data supporting the view that <i>C. suecica</i> is not a homogeneous species.
