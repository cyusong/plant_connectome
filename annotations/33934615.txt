The long noncoding RNA <i>ENOD40</i> is required for cortical cell division during root nodule symbiosis (RNS) of legumes, though it is not essential for actinorhizal RNS. Our objective was to understand whether <i>ENOD40</i> was required for aeschynomenoid nodule formation in <i>Arachis hypogaea</i>. <i>AhENOD40</i> express from chromosome 5 (chr5) (<i>AhENOD40-1</i>) and chr15 (<i>AhENOD40-2</i>) during symbiosis, and RNA interference of these transcripts drastically affected nodulation, indicating the importance of <i>ENOD40</i> in <i>A. hypogaea</i>. Furthermore, we demonstrated several distinct characteristics of <i>ENOD40</i>. (i) Natural antisense transcript (NAT) of <i>ENOD40</i> was detected from the <i>AhENOD40-1</i> locus (designated as NAT-<i>AhDONE40</i>). (ii) Both <i>AhENOD40-1</i> and <i>AhENOD40-2</i> had two exons, whereas NAT-<i>AhDONE40</i> was monoexonic. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR analysis indicated both sense and antisense transcripts to be present in both cytoplasm and nucleus, and their expression increased with the progress of symbiosis. (iii) RNA pull-down from whole cell extracts of infected roots at 4 days postinfection indicated NAT-<i>AhDONE40</i> to interact with the SET (Su(var)3-9, enhancer of Zeste and Trithorax) domain containing absent small homeotic disc (ASH) family protein AhASHR3 and this interaction was further validated using RNA immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. (iv) Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicate deposition of ASHR3-specific histone marks H3K36me3 and H3K4me3 in both of the <i>ENOD40</i> loci during the progress of symbiosis. ASHR3 is known for its role in optimizing cell proliferation and reprogramming. Because both ASHR3 and <i>ENOD40</i> from legumes cluster away from those in actinorhizal plants and other nonlegumes in phylogenetic distance trees, we hypothesize that the interaction of <i>DONE40</i> with ASHR3 could have evolved for adapting the nodule organogenesis program for legumes.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
