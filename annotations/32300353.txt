Increased temperatures caused by global warming threaten agricultural production, as warmer conditions can inhibit plant growth and development or even destroy crops in extreme circumstances. Extensive research over the past several decades has revealed that chloroplasts, the photosynthetic organelles of plants, are highly sensitive to heat stress, which affects a variety of photosynthetic processes including chlorophyll biosynthesis, photochemical reactions, electron transport, and CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation. Important mechanisms by which plant cells respond to heat stress to protect these photosynthetic organelles have been identified and analyzed. More recent studies have made it clear that chloroplasts play an important role in inducing the expression of nuclear heat-response genes during the heat stress response. In this review, we summarize these important advances in plant-based research and discuss how the sensitivity, responses, and signaling roles of chloroplasts contribute to plant heat sensitivity and tolerance.
