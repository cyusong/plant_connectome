['17933900', 'Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that regulate growth and  development throughout the life cycle of plants. DELLA proteins are conserved  growth repressors that modulate all aspects of GA responses. These GA-signaling  repressors are nuclear localized and likely function as transcriptional  regulators. Recent studies demonstrated that GA, upon binding to its receptor,  derepresses its signaling pathway by binding directly to DELLA proteins and  targeting them for rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.  Therefore, elucidating the signaling events immediately downstream of DELLA is  key to our understanding of how GA controls plant development. Two sets of  microarray studies followed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis allowed us to  identify 14 early GA-responsive genes that are also early DELLA-responsive in  Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Chromatin immunoprecipitation provided evidence  for in vivo association of DELLA with promoters of eight of these putative DELLA  target genes. Expression of all 14 genes was downregulated by GA and upregulated  by DELLA. Our study reveals that DELLA proteins play two important roles in GA  signaling: (1) they help establish GA homeostasis by direct feedback regulation  on the expression of GA biosynthetic and GA receptor genes, and (2) they promote  the expression of downstream negative components that are putative transcription  factors/regulators or ubiquitin E2/E3 enzymes. In addition, one of the putative  DELLA targets, XERICO, promotes accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) that  antagonizes GA effects. Therefore, DELLA may restrict GA-promoted processes by  modulating both GA and ABA pathways.', '2007 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.054999', 'Sun']
