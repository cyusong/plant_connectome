Global warming is one of the most detrimental aspects of climate change, affecting plant growth and development across the entire life cycle. This Review explores how different stages of development are influenced by elevated temperature in both wild plants and crops. Starting from seed development and germination, global warming will influence morphological adjustments, termed thermomorphogenesis, and photosynthesis primarily during the vegetative phase, as well as flowering and reproductive development. Where applicable, we distinguish between moderately elevated temperatures that affect all stages of plant development and heat waves that often occur during the reproductive phase when they can have devastating consequences for fruit development. The parallel occurrence of elevated temperature with other abiotic and biotic stressors, particularly the combination of global warming and drought or increased pathogen pressure, will potentiate the challenges for both wild and cultivated plant species. The key components of the molecular networks underlying the physiological processes involved in thermal responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana are highlighted. In crops, temperature-sensitive traits relevant for yield are illustrated for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.), representing cultivated species adapted to temperate vs. warm climate zones, respectively. While the fate of wild plants depends on political agendas, plant breeding approaches informed by mechanistic understanding originating in basic science can enable the generation of climate change-resilient crops.
