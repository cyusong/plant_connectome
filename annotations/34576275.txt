Plants have remarkable regenerative capacity, which allows them to survive tissue damage after exposure to biotic and abiotic stresses. Some of the key transcription factors and hormone crosstalk mechanisms involved in wound-induced organ regeneration have been extensively studied in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. However, little is known about the role of metabolism in wound-induced organ formation. Here, we performed detailed transcriptome analysis and used a targeted metabolomics approach to study de novo organ formation in tomato hypocotyl explants and found tissue-specific metabolic differences and divergent developmental pathways. Our results indicate that successful regeneration in the apical region of the hypocotyl depends on a specific metabolic switch involving the upregulation of photorespiratory pathway components and the differential regulation of photosynthesis-related gene expression and gluconeogenesis pathway activation. These findings provide a useful resource for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in wound-induced organ formation in crop species such as tomato.
