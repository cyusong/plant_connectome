Scientific progress in recent years has significantly unraveled several unique structural and functional aspects of the plasmodesmata (PD), such as demonstrating the presence of detergent-insoluble membrane microdomains enriched in sterols and sphingolipids. A recent study now shows that one of the sphingolipids, t18:0 phytoshinganine, binds to PD localizing protein 5 (PDLP5) and increases retention of PDLP5 at PD, which is known to be associated with reduced PD permeability. The dynamic interaction between lipids and PD-associated proteins assemble yet another piece of the PD puzzle.
