['18718758', 'Seasonal changes in day length influence flowering time in many plant species. In  Arabidopsis, flowering is accelerated by exposure to long day (LD). Those  inductive photoperiods are perceived in leaves [1] and initiate a long-distance  signaling mediated by CO and FT. CO is expressed in the phloem according to a  circadian rhythm [2-4]. Only under LD does CO induce FT expression as high levels  of CO in the evening coincide with the external light that stabilizes CO protein  [4, 5]. Subsequently, FT protein travels through the phloem to the shoot apex  where, together with FD, it initiates flowering [6-12]. Despite the photoperiodic  induction, a mechanism of floral repression is needed to avoid precocious  flowering. We show that TEMPRANILLO genes (TEM1 and TEM2) act as novel direct FT  repressors. Molecular and genetic analyses suggest that a quantitative balance  between the activator CO and the repressor TEM determines FT levels. Moreover,  developmental TEM downregulation marks the timing of flowering, as it shifts the  CO/TEM balance in favor of CO activity, allowing FT transcript to reach the  threshold level required to trigger flowering. We envision that this might be a  general mechanism between long-day plants to ensure a tight regulation of  flowering time.', '2008 Sep 9', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.075', 'Pelaz']
