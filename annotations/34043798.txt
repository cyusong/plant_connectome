Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are unstable reactive molecules that are toxic to cells. Regulation of ROS homeostasis is crucial to protect cells from dysfunction, senescence, and death. In plant leaves, ROS are mainly generated from chloroplasts and are tightly temporally restricted by the circadian clock. However, little is known about how ROS homeostasis is regulated in nonphotosynthetic organs, such as petals. Here, we showed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels exhibit typical circadian rhythmicity in rose (Rosa hybrida) petals, consistent with the measured respiratory rate. RNA-seq and functional screening identified a B-box gene, RhBBX28, whose expression was associated with H2O2 rhythms. Silencing RhBBX28 accelerated flower senescence and promoted H2O2 accumulation at night in petals, while overexpression of RhBBX28 had the opposite effects. RhBBX28 influenced the expression of various genes related to respiratory metabolism, including the TCA cycle and glycolysis, and directly repressed the expression of SUCCINATE DEHYDROGENASE 1, which plays a central role in mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) homeostasis. We also found that PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR8 (RhPIF8) could activate RhBBX28 expression to control H2O2 levels in petals and thus flower senescence. Our results indicate that the circadian-controlled RhPIF8-RhBBX28 module is a critical player that controls flower senescence by governing mtROS homeostasis in rose.
