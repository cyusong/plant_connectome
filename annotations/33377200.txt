The phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is triggered by internal and external signals that participate in circadian clock in plants. We identified a rice floral inhibitor OsPRR73 encoding a CONSTANS protein. Overexpression of OsPRR73 resulted in late heading under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions. Knockout mutants led to early heading under LD conditions but no change under SD. OsPRR73 mRNA accumulated at noon and exhibited a robust oscillation under constant light (LL) and constant darkness (DD) conditions. OsPRR73 overexpression exerted negative feedback on endogenous OsPRR73 expression and altered diurnal expressions of key flowering genes and circadian clock genes. OsPRR73 bound to the promoters of the floral gene Ehd1 and the circadian gene OsLHY, and significantly suppressed their expression at dawn. In LL and DD, the oscillatory patterns of the circadian genes OsLHY, OsTOC1, OsGI and OsELF3 were varied in OsPRR73OX and osprr73 mutants. OsPRR73 expression was decreased in osphyb mutants, and overexpression of OsPRR73 complemented the early heading date phenotype of osphyb, indicating OsPRR73 works downstream of OsPhyB. Therefore, OsPRR73 is involved in a feedback loop of the rice clock and connects the photoperiod flowering pathway by binding to the Ehd1 promoter in rice.
