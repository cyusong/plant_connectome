The cap-binding protein complex (CBC) binds to the caps of all RNA polymerase II transcripts, and plays an important role in RNA metabolism. We characterized interactions, localization and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of two subunits of the Arabidopsis thaliana cap-binding protein complex (AtCBC): AtCBP20 and AtCBP80. Using CFP/YFP-tagged proteins, we show that transport of AtCBC from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in the plant cell is different from that described in other eukaryotic cells. We show that the smaller subunit of the complex, AtCBP20, plays a crucial role in the nuclear import of AtCBC. The C-terminal part of AtCBP20 contains two functionally independent nuclear localization signals (NLSs). At least one of these two NLSs is required for the import of CBC into the plant nucleus. The interaction between the A. thaliana CBP20 and CBP80 was also analyzed in detail, using the yeast two-hybrid system and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays. The N-terminal part of AtCBP20 is essential for interaction with AtCBP80. Furthermore, AtCBP80 is important for the protein stability of the smaller subunit of CBC. Based on these data, we propose a model for the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of the CBC complex in plants.
