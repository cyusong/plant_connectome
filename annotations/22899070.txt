Plant defense mechanisms respond to diverse environmental factors and play key roles in signaling pathways. The phospholipidic signaling pathway forms part of the plant response to several phytoregulators, such as salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MJ), which have been widely used to stimulate secondary metabolite production in cell cultures. ( 1) Furthermore, it has been reported that the levels of such phytoregulators as SA and MJ can increase in response to stressful conditions. ( 2) (,) ( 3) The phospholipidic signal transduction system involves the generation of second messengers by the hydrolysis of phospholipids. In this study, we examined how phospholipidic signaling can be modulated depending on the growth stage of the culture, and we focused on two key lipases having relevant roles in the signaling cascades in plants. An evaluation was made of the effects of SA and MJ on the phospholipase activities in Capsicum chinense Jacq. suspension cells at different phases of the culture cycle. The treatment with SA differentially modified the phospholipase C (PLC) (EC: 3.1.4.3) and phospholipase D (PLD) (EC: 3.1.4.4) activities in a dose-dependent manner that also depended on the day of the culture cycle. In contrast, the treatment with MJ resulted in a biphasic behavior of the PLC and PLD activities. We conclude that the enzymatic activities in the phospholipidic signaling pathways are modified differentially depending on the day of the culture's growth cycle; accordingly, the response capacity to such environmental factors as phytoregulators is variable at different stages of growth and the physiology of the cells.
