['22868784', 'Plants possess an innate immune system enabling them to defend themselves against  pathogen attack. The accumulation of newly synthesized pathogenesis-related  proteins (PRs) is one of the most studied inducible plant defence response. In  this paper, we report on the characterization of a class I PR4 vacuolar protein  from Arabidopsis, named AtHEL. The protein has a modular structure consisting of  an N-terminal hevein-like domain (CB-HEL) and a C-terminal domain (CD-HEL) that  are posttranslationally processed. Both domains show a strong antifungal  activity, but they do not have chitinolitic properties. CD-HEL was found to be  endowed with RNase, but not DNase activity. Molecular modeling carried out on  both domains revealed that CB-HEL possesses a chitin binding site strictly  conserved between hevein-type peptides and that the cavity involved in substrate  interaction of CD-HEL do not show any residue substitution with respect to the  orthologous wheatwin1 from wheat. Using a fishing for partners approach, CB-HEL  was found to interact with a fungal fruiting body lectin. According to  literature, we can hypothesize that CB-HEL could cross the pathogen hyphal  membrane and that its interaction with a fungal lectin could knock out one of the  weapons that the fungus uses.', '2012 Aug 4', 'Biol Chem', '10.1515/hsz-2012-0225', 'Caporale']
