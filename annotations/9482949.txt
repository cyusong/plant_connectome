['9482949', 'The His to Asp phosphotransfer signal transduction mechanism involves three  common signaling domains: the transmitter (or His-kinase), the receiver, and the  histidine-containing phototransfer (HPt) domain. Typically, a sensor kinase has a  His-kinase domain and a response regulator has a receiver domain containing a  phosphoaccepting aspartate, whereas a histidine-containing phototransfer domain  serves as a mediator of the histidine-to-aspartate phosphotransfer. This signal  transduction mechanism was thought to be restricted to prokaryotes. However, many  examples have been discovered in diverse eukaryotic species including higher  plants. In Arabidopsis, three sensor kinases have been characterized, namely,  ETR1, ERS, and CKI1, which were suggested to be involved in ethylene- and  cytokinin-dependent signal transduction pathways, respectively. To date, no  response regulator has been discovered in higher plants. We identify five  distinct Arabidopsis response regulator genes, each encoding a protein containing  a receiver-like domain. In vivo and in vitro evidence that ARRs can function as  phosphoaccepting response regulators was obtained by employing the Escherichia  coli His-Asp phosphotransfer signaling system.', '1998 Mar 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.95.5.2691', 'Mizuno']
