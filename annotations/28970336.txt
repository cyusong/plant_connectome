Although exocytosis is critical for the proper trafficking of materials to the plasma membrane, relatively little is known about the mechanistic details of post-Golgi trafficking in plants. Here, we demonstrate that the DENN (Differentially Expressed in Normal and Neoplastic cells) domain protein STOMATAL CYTOKINESIS DEFECTIVE1 (SCD1) and SCD2 form a previously unknown protein complex, the SCD complex, that functionally interacts with subunits of the exocyst complex and the RabE1 family of GTPases in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Consistent with a role in post-Golgi trafficking, <i>scd1</i> and <i>scd2</i> mutants display defects in exocytosis and recycling of PIN2-GFP. Perturbation of exocytosis using the small molecule Endosidin2 results in growth inhibition and PIN2-GFP trafficking defects in <i>scd1</i> and <i>scd2</i> mutants. In addition to the exocyst, the SCD complex binds in a nucleotide state-specific manner with Sec4p/Rab8-related RabE1 GTPases and overexpression of wild-type RabE1 rescues <i>scd1</i> temperature-sensitive mutants. Furthermore, SCD1 colocalizes with the exocyst subunit, SEC15B, and RabE1 at the cell plate and in distinct punctae at or near the plasma membrane. Our findings reveal a mechanism for plant exocytosis, through the identification and characterization of a protein interaction network that includes the SCD complex, RabE1, and the exocyst.
