Plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remodelling is likely to be important for its function in targeted protein secretion, organelle interaction and signal exchange. It has been known for decades that the structure and movement of the ER network is mainly regulated by the actin cytoskeleton through actin motor proteins and membrane-cytoskeleton adaptors. Recent discoveries also revealed alternative pathways that influence ER movement, through a microtubule-based machinery. Therefore, plants utilize both cytoskeletal components to drive ER dynamics, a process that is likely to be dependent on the cell type and the developmental stages. On the other hand, the ER membrane also has a direct effect towards the organization of the cytoskeletal network and disrupting the tethering factors at the ER-PM interface also rearranges the cytoskeletal structure. However, the influence of the ER network on the cytoskeleton organization has not been studied. In this review, we will provide an overview of the ER-cytoskeleton network in plants, and discuss the most recent discoveries in the field.
