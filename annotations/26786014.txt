Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important gaseous transmitter in organisims. It widespreads in the organs and tissues of animals and participates in the biological process of cardiovascular relaxation, cell apoptosis and protection, inflammation and neuromodulation. H2S also can be synthesized in plants system and is involved in stress responses and the biological process of growth and development. This review describes the synthesis and biological function of H2S in plants. Based on our research for the adaptation of Lamiophlomis rotata to different altitude gradients, we firstly proposed H2S plays an important role in the adaptation of Lamiophlomis rotata to alpine environment.
