Sulfur is an essential element for all organisms. Plants must assimilate this nutrient from the environment and convert it into metabolically useful forms for the biosynthesis of a wide range of compounds, including cysteine and glutathione. This review summarizes structural biology studies on the enzymes involved in plant sulfur assimilation [ATP sulfurylase, adenosine-5'-phosphate (APS) reductase, and sulfite reductase], cysteine biosynthesis (serine acetyltransferase and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase), and glutathione biosynthesis (glutamate-cysteine ligase and glutathione synthetase) pathways. Overall, X-ray crystal structures of enzymes in these core pathways provide molecular-level information on the chemical events that allow plants to incorporate sulfur into essential metabolites and revealed new biochemical regulatory mechanisms, such as structural rearrangements, protein-protein interactions, and thiol-based redox switches, for controlling different steps in these pathways.
