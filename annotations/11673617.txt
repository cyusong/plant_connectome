['11673617', 'A eubacteria-type RNA polymerase (PEP) plays crucial roles for chloroplast  development in higher plants. The core subunits are encoded on plastid DNA (rpo  genes) while the regulatory sigma factors are encoded on the nuclear DNA (SIG  genes). However, the definite gene specificity of each sigma factor is unknown.  We recently identified an Arabidopsis recessive pale-green mutant abc1 in which  T-DNA is inserted in SIG2 (sigB). In this mutant, almost normal etioplasts were  developed under dark conditions while the small chloroplasts with poor thylakoid  membranes and stacked lamellar were developed under light conditions. The sig2-1  mutant was deficient in accumulating enough photosynthetic and  photosynthesis-related proteins as well as chlorophyll. However, mRNAs of their  structural genes were not significantly reduced. Further analyses revealed that  several plastid-encoded tRNAs including trnE-UUC that has dual function for  protein and ALA biosyntheses were drastically reduced in the sig2-1 mutant. In  contrast, nucleus-encoded T7 phage-type RNA polymerase (NEP)-dependent gene  transcripts were steadily accumulated in the mutant. These results indicate that  progress of chloroplast development requires SIG2-dependent expression of plastid  genes, particularly some of the tRNA genes.', '2001 Oct', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pce155', 'Takahashi']
