['12676998', 'The early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) belong to the multigenic family of  light-harvesting complexes, which bind chlorophyll and absorb solar energy in  green plants. ELIPs accumulate transiently in plants exposed to high light  intensities. By using an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant (chaos) affected in the  posttranslational targeting of light-harvesting complex-type proteins to the  thylakoids, we succeeded in suppressing the rapid accumulation of ELIPs during  high-light stress, resulting in leaf bleaching and extensive photooxidative  damage. Constitutive expression of ELIP genes in chaos before light stress  resulted in ELIP accumulation and restored the phototolerance of the plants to  the wild-type level. Free chlorophyll, a generator of singlet oxygen in the  light, was detected by chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime measurements in chaos  leaves before the symptoms of oxidative stress appeared. Our findings indicate  that ELIPs fulfill a photoprotective function that could involve either the  binding of chlorophylls released during turnover of pigment-binding proteins or  the stabilization of the proper assembly of those proteins during high-light  stress.', '2003 Apr 15', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0736939100', 'Havaux']
