Aphids are important herbivorous insects that can cause significant crop damage, leading to yield reduction and economic loss. One avenue being explored to reduce aphid impacts is the development of aphid-resistant plants. Under projected climate scenarios, it is expected that plants will be exposed to greater biotic and abiotic stress, including increased herbivorous insect infestation and exposure to prolonged periods of environmental stress, particularly drought. In response to these projections, plant-aphid interactions under drought conditions have been a subject of growing interest; however, few studies have looked at the impact of drought stress on plant resistance to aphids despite the potential importance for plant breeding. Here, we examine the latest scientific advances regarding variation in plant resistance to aphids under drought, emphasizing underlying mechanisms and functional trade-offs and propose a conceptual model relating plant tolerance to drought with plant resistance to aphids.
