['18641265', 'Differentiation of specialized cell types in multicellular organisms requires  orchestrated actions of cell fate determinants. Stomata, valves on the plant  epidermis, are formed through a series of differentiation events mediated by  three closely related basic-helix-loop-helix proteins: SPEECHLESS (SPCH), MUTE,  and FAMA. However, it is not known what mechanism coordinates their actions.  Here, we identify two paralogous proteins, SCREAM (SCRM) and SCRM2, which  directly interact with and specify the sequential actions of SPCH, MUTE, and  FAMA. The gain-of-function mutation in SCRM exhibited constitutive stomatal  differentiation in the epidermis. Conversely, successive loss of SCRM and SCRM2  recapitulated the phenotypes of fama, mute, and spch, indicating that SCRM and  SCRM2 together determined successive initiation, proliferation, and terminal  differentiation of stomatal cell lineages. Our findings identify the core  regulatory units of stomatal differentiation and suggest a model strikingly  similar to cell-type differentiation in animals. Surprisingly, map-based cloning  revealed that SCRM is INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION1, a master regulator of freezing  tolerance, thus implicating a potential link between the transcriptional  regulation of environmental adaptation and development in plants.', '2008 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.060848', 'Torii']
