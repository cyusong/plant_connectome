['8022831', 'Nitrilases (nitrile aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.5.1) convert nitriles to carboxylic  acids. We report the cloning, characterization, and expression patterns of four  Arabidopsis thaliana nitrilase genes (NIT1-4), one of which was previously  described [Bartling, D., Seedorf, M., Mithofer, A. & Weiler, E. W. (1992) Eur. J.  Biochem. 205, 417-424]. The nitrilase genes encode very similar proteins that  hydrolyze indole-3-acetonitrile to the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid in  vitro, and three of the four genes are tandemly arranged on chromosome III.  Northern analysis using gene-specific probes and analysis of transgenic plants  containing promoter-reporter gene fusions indicate that the four genes are  differentially regulated. NIT2 expression is specifically induced around lesions  caused by bacterial pathogen infiltration. The sites of nitrilase expression may  represent sites of auxin biosynthesis in A. thaliana.', '1994 Jul 5', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.91.14.6649', 'Fink']
