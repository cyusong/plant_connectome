White rot is one of the most dangerous fungal diseases and can considerably affect grape berry production and quality. However, few studies have focused on this disease, and thus, finding candidate white rot resistance genes is of great importance for breeding resistant grapevine cultivars. Based on field observations and indoor experiments, the cultivars "Victoria" and "Zhuosexiang" showed significant differences in white rot resistance. For understanding the molecular mechanisms behind it, different phenotypes of grapevine leaves were used for RNA sequencing via Illumina and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. A transcript library containing 53,906 reads, including known and novel transcripts, was constructed following the full-length transcriptome sequencing of the two grapevine cultivars. Genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis pathways showed different expression levels. Furthermore, four key transcription factors (TFs), NPR1, TGA4, Pti6, and MYC2, all involved in the SA and JA signal pathways were identified, and the expression profile revealed the different regulation of the pathogenesis related protein1 (PR1) resistance gene, as mediated by the four TFs. Full-length transcript sequencing can substantially improve the accuracy and integrity of gene prediction and gene function research in grapevine. Our results contribute to identify candidate resistance genes and improve our understanding of the genes and regulatory mechanisms involved in grapevine resistance to white rot.
