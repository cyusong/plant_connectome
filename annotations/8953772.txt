['8953772', 'The Arabidopsis Ara proteins belong to the Rab/Ypt family of small GTPases, which  are implicated in intracellular vesicular traffic. To understand their specific  roles in the cell, it is imperative to identify molecules that regulate the  GTPase cycle. Such molecules have been found and characterized in animals and  yeasts but not in plants. Using a yeast system, we developed a novel method of  functional screening to detect interactions between foreign genes and identified  this Rab regulator in plants. We found that the expression of the ARA4 gene in  yeast ypt mutants causes exaggeration of the mutant phenotype. By introducing an  Arabidopsis cDNA library into the ypt1 mutant, we isolated a clone whose  coexpression overcame the deleterious effect of ARA4. This gene encodes an  Arabidopsis homolog of the Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) and was named  AtGDI1. The expression of AtGDI1 complemented the yeast sec19-1 (gdi1) mutation.  AtGDI1 is expressed almost ubiquitously in Arabidopsis tissues. The method  described here indicates the physiological interaction of two plant molecules,  Ara4 and GDI, in yeast and should be applicable to other foreign genes.', '1996 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.8.11.2079', 'Nakano']
