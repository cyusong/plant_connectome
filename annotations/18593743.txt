The proper segregation of chromosomes during mitosis is required for accurate distribution of genetic information by two daughter cells. Here, we used live cell imaging of microtubules and kinetochores after treatment with an Aurora kinase inhibitor, hesperadin, in tobacco BY-2 cells to analyze the function of plant Aurora kinase during mitosis. Hesperadin treatment induced the delay of CenH3 alignment on the spindle equator. Furthermore, two types of dynamics of lagging CenH3s were observed during chromosome segregation. The findings indicate that the plant Aurora kinase has dual roles; correction of aberrant kinetochore-microtubule attachment and dissociation of cohesin during chromosome alignment and segregation.

Aurora kinase: !corrects! aberrant kinetochore-microtubule attachment 
Aurora kinase: !dissociates! cohesin during chromosome alignment and segregation 
CenH3: !aligns to! spindle equator 
CenH3: !lags! during chromosome segregation
