['14555691', "Plants synchronize developmental and metabolic processes with the earth's 24-h  rotation through the integration of circadian rhythms and responses to light. We  characterize the time for coffee (tic) mutant that disrupts circadian gating,  photoperiodism, and multiple circadian rhythms, with differential effects among  rhythms. TIC is distinct in physiological functions and genetic map position from  other rhythm mutants and their homologous loci. Detailed rhythm analysis shows  that the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein gene expression rhythm requires TIC  function in the mid to late subjective night, when human activity may require  coffee, in contrast to the function of EARLY-FLOWERING3 (ELF3) in the late day to  early night. tic mutants misexpress genes that are thought to be critical for  circadian timing, consistent with our functional analysis. Thus, we identify TIC  as a regulator of the clock gene circuit. In contrast to tic and elf3 single  mutants, tic elf3 double mutants are completely arrhythmic. Even the robust  circadian clock of plants cannot function with defects at two different phases.", '2003 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.013730', 'Millar']
