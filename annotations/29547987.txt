In cotton, the formation of fruiting branches affects both plant architecture and fiber yield. Here, we report map-based cloning of the axillary flowering mutation gene (GbAF) that causes bolls to be borne directly on the main plant stem in Gossypium barbadense, and of the clustered boll mutation gene (cl1) in G. hirsutum. Both mutant alleles were found to represent point mutations at the Cl1 locus. Therefore, we propose that the GbAF mutation be referred to as cl1b. These Cl1 loci correspond to homologs of tomato SELF-PRUNING (SP), i.e. Gossypium spp. SP (GoSP) genes. In tetraploid cottons, single monogenic mutation of either duplicate GoSP gene (one in the A and one in the D subgenome) is associated with the axillary cluster flowering phenotype, although the shoot-indeterminate state of the inflorescence is maintained. By contrast, silencing of both GoSPs leads to the termination of flowering or determinate plants. The architecture of axillary flowering cotton allows higher planting density, contributing to increased fiber yield. Taken together the results provide new insights into the underlying mechanism of branching in cotton species, and characterization of GoSP genes may promote the development of compact cultivars to increase global cotton production.
