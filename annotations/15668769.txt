Recently, it has been reported that the cold-stress protein CSP 310, discovered in the cytoplasm of cold-resistant winter cereals, causes uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation during cold stress. To understand how the uncoupling mechanism of CSP differs from that of cyanide-insensitive alternative oxidase and plant mitochondrial uncoupling protein, we determined the effect of respiratory-chain inhibition on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Zalarinka) mitochondria. Our data show a possible involvement of stress protein CSP 310 in mitochondrial electron transport in winter wheat. CSP 310 shunts electrons around the main cytochrome pathway of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, i.e. electron flow bypasses ubiquinone and complex III via CSP 310 to complex IV.
