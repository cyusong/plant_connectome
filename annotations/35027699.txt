Although great progress has been achieved regarding wheat genetic transformation technology in the past decade<sup>1-3</sup>, genotype dependency, the most impactful factor in wheat genetic transformation, currently limits the capacity for wheat improvement by transgenic integration and genome-editing approaches. The application of regeneration-related genes during in vitro culture could potentially contribute to enhancement of plant transformation efficiency<sup>4-11</sup>. In the present study, we found that overexpression of the wheat gene TaWOX5 from the WUSCHEL family dramatically increases transformation efficiency with less genotype dependency than other methods. The expression of TaWOX5 in wheat calli prohibited neither shoot differentiation nor root development. Moreover, successfully transformed transgenic wheat plants can clearly be recognized based on a visible botanic phenotype, relatively wider flag leaves. Application of TaWOX5 improved wheat immature embryo transformation and regeneration. The use of TaWOX5 in improvement of transformation efficiency also showed promising results in Triticum monococcum, triticale, rye, barley and maize.
