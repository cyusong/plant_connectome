['19139039', 'Successful automatic self-pollination in flowering plants is dependent on the  correct development of reproductive organs. In the stamen, the appropriate growth  of the filament, which largely depends on the mechanical properties of the cell  wall, is required to position the anther correctly close to the stigma at the  pollination stage. Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) are a family  of enzymes that mediate the construction and restructuring of xyloglucan  cross-links, thereby controlling the extensibility or mechanical properties of  the cell wall in a wide variety of plant tissues. Our reverse genetic analysis  has revealed that a loss-of-function mutation of an Arabidopsis XTH family gene,  AtXTH28, led to a decrease in capability for self-pollination, probably due to  inhibition of stamen filament growth. Our results also suggest that the role of  AtXTH28 in the development of the stamen is not functionally redundant with its  closest paralog, AtXTH27. Thus, our finding indicates that AtXTH28 is  specifically involved in the growth of stamen filaments, and is required for  successful automatic self-pollination in certain flowers in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2009 Feb', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcp003', 'Nishitani']
