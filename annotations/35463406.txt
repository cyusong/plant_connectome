Coffee (<i>Coffea arabica</i> L.) presents an asynchronous flowering regulated by an endogenous and environmental stimulus, and anthesis occurs once plants are rehydrated after a period of water deficit. We evaluated the evolution of Abscisic Acid (ABA), ethylene, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) content, ACC oxidase (ACO) activity, and expression analysis of the <i>Lysine Histidine Transporter</i> 1 (<i>LHT1</i>) transporter, in the roots, leaves, and flower buds from three coffee genotypes (<i>C. arabica</i> L. cv Oeiras, Acauã, and Semperflorens) cultivated under field conditions with two experiments. In a third field experiment, the effect of the exogenous supply of ACC in coffee anthesis was evaluated. We found an increased ACC level, low ACO activity, decreased level of ethylene, and a decreased level of ABA in all tissues from the three coffee genotypes in the re-watering period just before anthesis, and a high expression of the <i>LHT1</i> in flower buds and leaves. The ethylene content and ACO activity decreased from rainy to dry period whereas the ABA content increased. A higher number of opened and G6 stage flower buds were observed in the treatment with exogenous ACC. The results showed that the interaction of ABA-ACO-ethylene and intercellular ACC transport among the leaves, buds, and roots in coffee favors an increased level of ACC that is most likely, involved as a modulator in coffee anthesis. This study provides evidence that ACC can play an important role independently of ethylene in the anthesis process in a perennial crop.
