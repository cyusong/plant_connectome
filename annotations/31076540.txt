Cellular calcium elevation is an important signal used by plants for recognition and signaling of environmental stress. Perception of the generalist insect, <i>Spodoptera litura</i>, by Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) activates cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, which triggers downstream defense. However, not all the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels generating the signal have been identified, nor are their modes of action known. We report on a rapidly activated, leaf vasculature- and plasma membrane-localized, CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNEL19 (CNGC19), which activates herbivory-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and plant defense. Loss of <i>CNGC19</i> function results in decreased herbivory defense. The <i>cngc19</i> mutant shows aberrant and attenuated intravascular Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes. CNGC19 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channel, as hyperpolarization of CNGC19-expressing <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes in the presence of both cyclic adenosine monophosphate and Ca<sup>2+</sup> results in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Breakdown of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-based defense in <i>cngc19</i> mutants leads to a decrease in herbivory-induced jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine biosynthesis and expression of JA responsive genes. The <i>cngc19</i> mutants are deficient in aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation and hyperaccumulate its precursor, methionine. CNGC19 modulates aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in tandem with BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID TRANSAMINASE4, which is involved in the chain elongation pathway of Met-derived glucosinolates. Furthermore, CNGC19 interacts with herbivory-induced CALMODULIN2 in planta. Together, our work reveals a key mechanistic role for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel CNGC19 in the recognition of herbivory and the activation of defense signaling.
