The goal of this research is to determine the mechanism of action of two <i>Bacillus</i> spp. that can manage <i>Meloidogyne incognita</i> population density in cotton. The overall objectives are 1) determine the efficacy and direct antagonistic capabilities of the <i>Bacillus</i> spp. and 2) determine the systemic capabilities of the <i>Bacillus</i> spp. The greenhouse <i>in planta</i> assay indicated <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i> QST713 and <i>B. firmus</i> I-1582 could manage <i>M. incognita</i> similarly to the chemical standard fluopyram. An <i>in vitro</i> assay determined that <i>B. firmus</i> I-1582 and its extracted metabolites were able to directly manage <i>M. incognita</i> second stage juveniles by increasing mortality rate above 75%. A split root assay, used to determine systemic capabilities of the bacteria, indicated <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i> QST713 and <i>B. firmus</i> I-1582 could indirectly decrease the nematode population density. Another species, <i>B. mojavensis</i> strain 2, also demonstrated systemic capabilities but was not a successful biological control agent because it supported a high population density in greenhouse <i>in planta</i> assay and in the split root assay. A RT-qPCR assay was used to confirm any systemic activity observed in the split root assay. At 24 hours both <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i> QST713 and <i>B. firmus</i> I-1582 upregulated one gene involved in the initial stages of JA synthesis pathway but not another gene involved in the later stages of JA synthesis. These results point to a JA intermediate molecule, most likely OPDA, stimulated by the bacteria rather than JA in a short-term systemic response. After 1 week, the <i>Bacillus</i> spp. stimulated a SA-responsive defense related gene. The long-term systemic response to the <i>Bacillus</i> spp. indicates salicylic acid also plays a role in defense conferred by these bacteria. The final assay was a qPCR to determine the concentration of the bacteria on the cotton roots after 24 days. <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> QST713 and <i>B. firmus</i> I-43 1582 were able to colonize the root successfully, with the concentration after 24 days not significantly differing from the concentration at inoculation. This study identifies two bacteria that work <i>via</i> systemic resistance and will help aid in implementing these species in an integrated management system.
