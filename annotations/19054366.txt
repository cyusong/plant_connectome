['19054366', 'Ovules are the female reproductive structures that develop into seeds. Angiosperm  ovules include one, or more commonly two, integuments that cover the nucellus and  female gametophyte. Mutations in the Arabidopsis KANADI (KAN) and YABBY polarity  genes result in amorphous or arrested integument growth, suggesting that polarity  determinants play key roles in ovule development. We show that the class III  homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIPIII) genes CORONA (CNA), PHABULOSA (PHB) and  PHAVOLUTA (PHV) are expressed adaxially in the inner integument during ovule  development, independent of ABERRANT TESTA SHAPE (ATS, also known as KANADI4)  activity. Loss of function of these genes leads to aberrant integument growth.  Additionally, over-expression of PHB or PHV in ovules is not sufficient to  repress ATS expression, and can produce phenotypes similar to those of the  HD-ZIPIII loss-of-function lines. The absence of evidence of mutual negative  regulation by KAN and HD-ZIPIII transcription factors is in contrast to known  mechanisms in leaves. Loss of HD-ZIPIII activity can partially compensate for  loss of ATS activity in the ats cna phb phv quadruple mutant, showing that  CNA/PHB/PHV act in concert with ATS to control integument morphogenesis. In a  parallel pathway, ATS acts with REVOLUTA (REV) to restrict expression of INNER NO  OUTER (INO) and outer integument growth. Based on these expression and genetic  studies, we propose a model in which a balance between the relative levels of  adaxial/abaxial activities, rather than maintenance of boundaries of expression  domains, is necessary to support laminar growth of the two integuments.', '2009 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03752.x', 'Gasser']
