N-MYR controls the function of the plant protein complex SnRK1, described as one of the most important plant regulatory protein in stress and energy signalling. In plant cells, N-MYR is involved in a significantly higher number of metabolic pathways than in yeast or human. Some N-myristoylated protein families are solely encountered in plant cells. This lipid modification could be involved in the control of the redox imbalances originating from different stresses in plants. This prevalence of N-MYR in such proteins is unique to the plant kingdom. We hypothesize that this expansion of the mechanism in plants improves the control of the damages induced by environmental changes.
