['8224199', 'A class of protein kinases in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana has been identified  which has biochemical characteristics similar to those of the animal receptor  protein kinases. These plant protein kinases are membrane-associated,  glycosylated, exhibit a preference for Mn2+ relative to Mg2+, and range from 115  to 135 kDa when identified by renaturation after protein blotting. Evidence is  presented that the TMK1 protein, a receptor-like protein kinase identified in  Arabidopsis from its cloned gene, is also glycosylated in its native form, and  shows a preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+ when assayed for kinase activity. All of  the plant receptor-like protein kinases identified phosphorylate only serine and  threonine residues.', '1993 Nov 1', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/0014-5793(93)80676-l', 'Bleecker']
