['25203210', 'In organellogenesis of the chloroplast from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria, the  establishment of protein-targeting mechanisms to the chloroplast should have been  pivotal. However, it is still mysterious how these mechanisms were established  and how they work in plant cells. Here we show that AKR2A, the cytosolic  targeting factor for chloroplast outer membrane (COM) proteins, evolved from the  ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of the host cell by stepwise extensions of its  N-terminal domain and that two lipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and  phosphatidylglycerol (PG), of the endosymbiont were selected to function as the  AKR2A receptor. Structural analysis, molecular modeling, and mutational analysis  of the ARD identified two adjacent sites for coincidental and synergistic binding  of MGDG and PG. Based on these findings, we propose that the targeting mechanism  of COM proteins was established using components from both the endosymbiont and  host cell through a modification of the protein-protein-interacting ARD into a  lipid binding domain.', '2014 Sep 8', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2014.07.026', 'Hwang']
