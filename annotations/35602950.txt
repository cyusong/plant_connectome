['35602950', 'Pectin is biosynthesized in a highly methylated form and is partially  de-methylated by pectin methylesterase (PME) activity. Plant PMEs play a critical  role in cell wall remodeling in many physiological processes. Here, we studied  Arabidopsis seedlings, which had been exposed to simulated or actual  microgravity. Simulated microgravity inhibited total PME activity in Arabidopsis  seedlings. We identified that AtPMEPCRA expression played a major role in the  microgravity-induced inhibition of PME activity. atpmepcra mutants did not  exhibit the enlarged leaf area of Arabidopsis seedlings observed under  spaceflight microgravity. The downregulation of AtPMEPCRA expression in response  to microgravity was due, in part, to changes in methylation patterns. The sexual  offspring of the plants grown during spaceflight retained the methylation changes  at AtPMEPCRA locus for one generation and thus contribute to the physiological  adaptation to microgravity among F(1) offspring seed generation. We conclude that  AtPMEPCRA contributes to the spaceflight-induced transgenerational responses in  Arabidopsis.', '2022 May 20', 'iScience', '10.1016/j.isci.2022.104331', 'Cai']
