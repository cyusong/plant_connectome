Imaging Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry provides a new and powerful tool to analyse the distribution of metabolites within plant tissues. The two matrices alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (alpha-CHCA) and 9-aminoacridine provide a useful combination that allows the measurement of amino acids, sugars, and phosphorylated metabolites. Results are presented showing that representatives of these metabolites are unevenly distributed in wheat seeds at different stages of development and under temperature stress.

Metabolites: !unevenly distributed in! wheat seeds
