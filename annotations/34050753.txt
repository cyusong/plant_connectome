Plants have evolved complex mechanisms to adapt to the changing nitrogen levels in the environment. In Arabidopsis, more than a dozen nitrate signaling regulatory genes have been characterized, including the NODULE INCEPTION-LIKE PROTEIN (AtNLP) genes, which play essential roles in nitrate signaling. However, whether NLP genes in the Triticeae crops are involved in nitrate regulation and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) remains unknown. Here, we isolated a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) mutant, hvnlp2-1, from a TILLING (Targeting Local Lesions IN Genomes) population and constructed two RNAi lines, hvnlp2-2 and hvnlp2-3, to study the function of HvNLP2. The expression of the nitrate-responsive genes was substantially inhibited after nitrate treatment in the hvnlp2 mutants, indicating that HvNLP2 controls nitrate signaling. Nitrate content was significantly higher in the hvnlp2 mutants, which may result from the decreased assimilation of nitrogen caused by reduced nitrate reductase activity and expression of nitrate assimilatory genes. HvNLP2 is localized to the nucleus in the presence of nitrate. Further investigation showed that HvNLP2 binds to and activates the nitrate-responsive cis-elements. Moreover, hvnlp2 exhibited reduced biomass, seed yield, and NUE. Therefore, HvNLP2 controls nitrate signaling and plays an important role in NUE.
