['20478894', "Viral pathogens continue to emerge among humans, domesticated animals and  cultivated crops. The existence of genetic variance for resistance in the host  population is crucial to the spread of an emerging virus. Models predict that  rapid spread decreases with the frequency and diversity of resistance alleles in  the host population. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis are scarce.  Arabiodpsis thaliana--tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) provides an experimentally  suitable pathosystem to explore the interplay between genetic variation in host's  susceptibility and virus diversity. Systemic infection of A. thaliana with TEV is  controlled by three dominant loci, with different ecotypes varying in  susceptibility depending on the genetic constitution at these three loci. Here,  we show that the TEV adaptation to a susceptible ecotype allowed the virus to  successfully infect, replicate and induce symptoms in ecotypes that were fully  resistant to the ancestral virus. The value of these results is twofold. First,  we showed that the existence of partially susceptible individuals allows for the  emerging virus to bypass resistance alleles that the virus has never encountered.  Second, the concept of resistance genes may only be valid for a well-defined  viral genotype but not for polymorphic viral populations.", '2010 Jun 27', 'Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci', '10.1098/rstb.2010.0044', 'Elena']
