Mechanisms of phloem loading in the minor veins of leaves are known for only a few species. We propose that there are a limited number of loading strategies for the primary photoassimilates, sucrose and sugar alcohols. These strategies can be predicted based on thermodynamic and anatomical considerations and identified by autoradiography of veins following uptake of (14)C-labeled compounds, analysis of leaf solute composition and concentrations, and plasmodesmatal counting. Experiments on 45 dicotyledonous species identified the predicted loading patterns. Over 50-fold differences in concentrations of sucrose and sugar alcohols in leaves were measured. The cumulative concentrations of transport compounds in leaves correlated with loading mechanisms, a previously unrecognized association. Comparisons of solute concentrations and osmotic potentials of whole leaves suggest that sucrose and sugar alcohols are more concentrated in the cytosol than in the vacuoles of mesophyll cells, thus increasing the driving force for passive loading in species that employ this strategy. Passive loading is more widespread than previously thought, especially in trees. The results indicate that plants have exploited all thermodynamically feasible and structurally compatible loading strategies and that these strategies can be identified with straightforward protocols.
