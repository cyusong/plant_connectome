The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays critical roles in abiotic stress responses and plant development. In germinating seeds, the phytochrome-associated protein phosphatase, FyPP3, negatively regulates ABA signaling by dephosphorylating the transcription factor ABI5. However, whether and how FyPP3 is regulated at the posttranscriptional level remains unclear. Here, we report that an asparagine-rich protein, NRP, interacts with FyPP3 and tethers FyPP3 to SYP41/61-positive endosomes for subsequent degradation in the vacuole. Upon ABA treatment, the expression of NRP was induced and NRP-mediated FyPP3 turnover was accelerated. Consistently, ABA-induced FyPP3 turnover was abolished in an nrp null mutant. On the other hand, FyPP3 can dephosphorylate NRP in vitro, and overexpression of FyPP3 reduced the half-life of NRP in vivo. Genetic analyses showed that NRP has a positive role in ABA-mediated seed germination and gene expression, and that NRP is epistatic to FyPP3. Taken together, our results identify a new regulatory circuit in the ABA signaling network, which links the intracellular trafficking with ABA signaling.
