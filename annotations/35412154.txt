Glandular trichomes of Artemisia argyi H. Lév. & Vaniot are the key tissues for the production of flavonoid and terpenoid metabolites. Artemisia argyi H. Lév. & Vaniot is an herbaceous perennial plant that has been widely used in traditional medicine for thousands of years. Glandular trichomes (GTs) and nonglandular trichomes (NGTs) have been reported on the leaf surface of A. argyi. The aim of this study was to elucidate the morphogenetic process and to analyze the metabolites of trichomes in A. argyi. The morphogenesis of GTs and NGTs was characterized using light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. The constituents of GTs were analyzed using laser microdissection combined with gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Five developmental stages of two types of GTs and four developmental stages of one type of NGTs were observed. Two types of mature GT and one type of NGT were composed of 10, 5, and 4-6 cells, respectively. A large storage cavity was detected between the cuticle and cell walls in the first type of mature GT. Large nuclei, nucleoli, and mitochondria were observed in the basal and intermediate cells of the second type of GT. In addition, large vacuoles were observed in the basal and apical cells, and large nuclei were observed in the middle cells of NGTs. One monoterpene and seven flavonoids were identified in GTs of A. argyi. We suggest that GTs are the key tissues for the production of bioactive metabolites in A. argyi. This study provides an important theoretical basis and technical approach for clarifying the regulatory mechanisms for trichome development and bioactive metabolite biosynthesis in A. argyi.
