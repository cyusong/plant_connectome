Leaf spray-MS minimizes tissue manipulation by effectively and quickly assessing in vivo specialized metabolites from intact plant tissue surfaces, including trichome metabolites. Intact leaves of Glycyrrhiza lepidota Pursh. (American licorice) were analyzed by direct electrospray leaf spray-MS, an ambient ionization technique. Comparison of metabolites detected by leaf spray-MS to those from LC-MS of bulk tissue and trichome enriched extracts showed dramatic differences. Leaf spray-MS results suggest that in specific situations this approach could complement traditional LC-MS analysis of bulk extracts. Leaf spray-MS as a metabolomics technique eliminates sample pretreatment and preparation allowing for rapid sampling in real time of living intact tissues. Specialized metabolites on the surface of tissues such as glandular trichomes metabolites are detected by leaf spray-MS.
