Sphingolipids are enriched in microdomains in the plant plasma membrane (PM). Hydroxyl groups in the characteristic long-chain base (LCB) moiety might be essential for the interaction between sphingolipids and sterols during microdomain formation. Investigating LCB hydroxylase mutants in Physcomitrium patens might therefore reveal the role of certain plant sphingolipids in the formation of PM subdomains. Physcomitrium patens mutants for the LCB C-4 hydroxylase S4H were generated by homologous recombination. Plants were characterised by analysing their sphingolipid and steryl glycoside (SG) profiles and by investigating different gametophyte stages. s4h mutants lost the hydroxyl group at the C-4 position of their LCB moiety. Loss of this hydroxyl group caused global changes in the moss sphingolipidome and in SG composition. Changes in membrane lipid composition may trigger growth defects by interfering with the localisation of membrane-associated proteins that are crucial for growth processes such as signalling receptors or callose-modifying enzymes. Loss of LCB-C4 hydroxylation substantially changes the P. patens sphingolipidome and reveals a key role for S4H during development of nonvascular plants. Physcomitrium patens is a valuable model for studying the diversification of plant sphingolipids. The simple anatomy of P. patens facilitates visualisation of physiological processes in biological membranes.
