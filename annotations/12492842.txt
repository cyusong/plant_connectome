['12492842', "The plant hormone, auxin, regulates many aspects of growth and development.  Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of auxin  are largely unknown. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the primary  responses to auxin, we analyzed the expression of genes in Arabidopsis seedlings  treated with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) for 15 min. We identified a single gene  that is downregulated early, and 29 genes that are upregulated early. Several  types of typical transcription factors are identified as early upregulated genes,  suggesting that auxin signals are mediated by a master set of diverse  transcriptional regulators. Of the genes that responded to auxin, the expression  of the homeobox gene, HAT2, was induced rapidly. Furthermore, we show that the  expression of HAT2 is induced by auxin, but not by other phytohormones. To  analyze the function of HAT2 in the plant's response to auxin, we generated  35S::HAT2 transgenic plants. These produced long hypocotyls, epinastic  cotyledons, long petioles, and small leaves, which are characteristic of the  phenotypes of the auxin-overproducing mutants, superroot1 (sur1) and superroot2  (sur2). On the other hand, 35S::HAT2 plants showed reduced lateral root  elongation, and reduced auxin sensitivity compared to wild-type plants. Together  with the results of RNA blotting and biochemical analyses, these findings suggest  that HAT2 plays opposite roles in the shoot and root tissues in regulating  auxin-mediated morphogenesis.", '2002 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2002.01488.x', 'Koshiba']
