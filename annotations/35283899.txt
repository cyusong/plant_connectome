<i>Phyllospadix iwatensis</i>, a foundation species of the angiosperm-dominated marine blue carbon ecosystems, has been recognized to be a vulnerable seagrass. Its degradation has previously been reported to be associated with environmental changes and human activities, while there has been a limited number of studies on its inherent characteristics. In this study, both the physiological and molecular biological data indicated that the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of <i>P. iwatensis</i> is prone to photoinactivation, which exhibits the light-dependent trait. When exposed to laboratory light intensities similar to typical midday conditions, <10% of the OEC was photoinactivated, and the remaining active OEC was sufficient to maintain normal photosynthetic activity. Moreover, the photoinactivated OEC could fully recover within the same day. However, under harsh light conditions, e.g., light intensities that simulate cloudless sunny neap tide days and continual sunny days, the OEC suffered irreversible photoinactivation, which subsequently resulted in damage to the photosystem II reaction centers and a reduction in the rate of O<sub>2</sub> evolution. Furthermore, <i>in situ</i> measurements on a cloudless sunny neap tide day revealed both poor resilience and irreversible photoinactivation of the OEC. Based on these findings, we postulated that the OEC dysfunction induced by ambient harsh light conditions could be an important inherent reason for the degradation of <i>P. iwatensis.</i>
