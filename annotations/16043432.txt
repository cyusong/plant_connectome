['16043432', 'The proper control of cell expansion is vital to plant development. It is  responsible for shaping individual cells and, together with cell division, it  plays a lead role in shaping plant organs. Much of the underlying mechanism by  which plant cells expand anisotropically is not understood. We are taking a  genetic approach to cell expansion by isolating mutants that affect the branching  pattern of Arabidopsis trichomes. Here we report the identification of four new  loci that control trichome morphogenesis. These loci were named the IRREGULAR  TRICHOME BRANCH (ITB) loci because of the deleterious effects on branch position  and length in the mutants. Our analysis of branch expansion in itb mutants shows  that the ITB genes act as positive regulators of branch elongation, and that the  branch position defects are caused by altered expansion of the trichome stalk.  The itb mutations display synergistic effects in double mutant combinations with  certain branch number mutations, suggesting that the ITB genes also play key  roles in branch initiation. These results demonstrate that the ITB genes are key  regulators of anisotropic cell expansion in trichomes.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pci168', 'Oppenheimer']
