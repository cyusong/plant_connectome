['27274065', 'Cytokinin is an essential phytohormone that controls various biological processes  in plants. A number of response regulators are known to be important for  cytokinin signal transduction. ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 4 (ARR4) mediates  the cross-talk between light and cytokinin signaling through modulation of the  activity of phytochrome B. However, the mechanism that regulates the activity and  stability of ARR4 is unknown. Here we identify an ATP-independent serine  protease, degradation of periplasmic proteins 9 (DEG9), which localizes to the  nucleus and regulates the stability of ARR4. Biochemical evidence shows that DEG9  interacts with ARR4, thereby targeting ARR4 for degradation, which suggests that  DEG9 regulates the stability of ARR4. Moreover, genetic evidence shows that DEG9  acts upstream of ARR4 and regulates the activity of ARR4 in cytokinin and  light-signaling pathways. This study thus identifies a role for a  ubiquitin-independent selective protein proteolysis in the regulation of the  stability of plant signaling components.', '2016 Jun 21', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1601724113', 'Zhang']
