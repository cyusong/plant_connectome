Red coloration around the stone (Cs) is an important trait of canned peaches (Prunus persica). In this study, an elongated hypocotyl 5 gene in peach termed PpHY5 was identified to participate in the regulation of the Cs trait. The E3 ubiquitin ligase PpCOP1 was expressed in the flesh around the stone and could interact with PpHY5. Although HY5 is known to be degraded by COP1 in darkness, the PpHY5 gene was activated in the flesh tissue surrounding the stone at the ripening stages and its expression was consistent with anthocyanin accumulation. PpHY5 was able to promote the transcription of PpMYB10.1 through interacting with its partner PpBBX10. Silencing of PpHY5 in the flesh around the stone caused a reduction in anthocyanin pigmentation, while transient overexpression of PpHY5 and PpBBX10 resulted in anthocyanin accumulation in peach fruits. Moreover, transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing PpHY5 showed increased anthocyanin accumulation in leaves. Our results improve our understanding of the mechanisms of anthocyanin coloration in plants.
