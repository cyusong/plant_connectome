Heightening the resistance of plants to microbial infection is a widely concerned issue, especially for economical crops. Receptor-like proteins (RLPs), typically with tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) domain, play a crucial role in mediating immune activation, being an indispensable constituent in the first layer of defense. Based on an analysis of orthologs among <i>Brassica rapa, Brassica oleracea</i>, and <i>Brassica napus</i> using <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> RLPs as a reference framework, we found that compared to <i>A. thaliana</i>, there were some obvious evolutionary diversities of RLPs among the three <i>Brassicaceae</i> species. <i>BnRLP</i> encoding genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes, mainly on chrA01, chrA04, chrC03, chrC04, and chrC06. The orthologs of five <i>At</i>RLPs (<i>At</i>RLP3, <i>At</i>RLP10, <i>At</i>RLP17, <i>At</i>RLP44, and <i>At</i>RLP51) were highly conserved, but retrenchment and functional centralization occurred in <i>Brassicaceae</i> RLPs during evolution. The RLP proteins were clustered into 13 subgroups. Ten <i>BnRLPs</i> presented expression specificity between R and S when elicited by <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>, which might be fabulous candidates for <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> resistance research.
