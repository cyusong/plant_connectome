['22238427', 'Floral organs are specified by the combinatorial action of MADS-domain  transcription factors, yet the mechanisms by which MADS-domain proteins activate  or repress the expression of their target genes and the nature of their cofactors  are still largely unknown. Here, we show using affinity purification and mass  spectrometry that five major floral homeotic MADS-domain proteins (AP1, AP3, PI,  AG, and SEP3) interact in floral tissues as proposed in the "floral quartet"  model. In vitro studies confirmed a flexible composition of MADS-domain protein  complexes depending on relative protein concentrations and DNA sequence. In situ  bimolecular fluorescent complementation assays demonstrate that MADS-domain  proteins interact during meristematic stages of flower development. By applying a  targeted proteomics approach we were able to establish a MADS-domain protein  interactome that strongly supports a mechanistic link between MADS-domain  proteins and chromatin remodeling factors. Furthermore, members of other  transcription factor families were identified as interaction partners of floral  MADS-domain proteins suggesting various specific combinatorial modes of action.', '2012 Jan 31', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1112871109', 'Kaufmann']
