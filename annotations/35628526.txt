Abiotic stresses rewire plant central metabolism to maintain metabolic and energy homeostasis. Metabolites involved in the plant central metabolic network serve as a hub for regulating carbon and energy metabolism under various stress conditions. In this review, we introduce recent metabolomics techniques used to investigate the dynamics of metabolic responses to abiotic stresses and analyze the trend of publications in this field. We provide an updated overview of the changing patterns in central metabolic pathways related to the metabolic responses to common stresses, including flooding, drought, cold, heat, and salinity. We extensively review the common and unique metabolic changes in central metabolism in response to major abiotic stresses. Finally, we discuss the challenges and some emerging insights in the future application of metabolomics to study plant responses to abiotic stresses.
