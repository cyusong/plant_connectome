PIN-FORMED (PIN)-dependent directional auxin transport is crucial for plant development. Although the redistribution of auxin mediated by the polarization of PIN3 plays key roles in modulating hypocotyl cell expansion, how PIN3 becomes repolarized to the proper sites within hypocotyl cells is poorly understood. We previously generated the clathrin light chain clc2-1 clc3-1 double mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that it has an elongated hypocotyl phenotype compared to the wild type. Here, we performed genetic, cell biology, and pharmacological analyses combined with live-cell imaging to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the role of clathrin light chains in hypocotyl elongation. Our analyses indicated that the defects of the double mutant enhanced auxin maxima in epidermal cells, thus, promoting hypocotyl elongation. PIN3 relocated to the lateral sides of hypocotyl endodermal cells in clc2-1 clc3-1 mutants to redirect auxin toward the epidermal cell layers. Moreover, the loss of function of PIN3 largely suppressed the long hypocotyl phenotype of the clc2-1 clc3-1 double mutant, as did treatment with auxin transport inhibitors. Based on these data, we propose that clathrin modulates PIN3 abundance and polarity to direct auxin flux and inhibit cell elongation in the hypocotyl, providing novel insights into the regulation of hypocotyl elongation.
