Based on the nature of the proteins that are altered in abundance, we conclude that guard cells switch their energy source from fatty acid metabolism to chloroplast activity, at the onset of dawn. During stomatal opening at dawn, evidence was recently presented for a breakdown and liquidation of stored triacylglycerols in guard cells to supply ATP for use in stomatal opening. However, proteome changes that happen in the guard cells during dawn were until now poorly understood. Bad accessibility to pure and intact guard cell samples can be considered as the primary reason behind this lack of knowledge. To overcome these technical constraints, epidermal guard cell samples with ruptured pavement cells were isolated at 1 h pre-dawn, 15 min post-dawn and 1 h post-dawn from Arabidopsis thaliana. Proteomic changes were analysed by ultra-performance-liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry. With 994 confidently identified proteins, we present the first analysis of the A. thaliana guard cell proteome that is not influenced by side effects of guard cell protoplasting. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD009918. By elucidating the identities of enzymes that change in abundance by the transition from dark to light, we corroborate the hypothesis that respiratory ATP production for stomatal opening results from fatty acid beta-oxidation. Moreover, we identified many proteins that were never reported in the context of guard cell biology. Among them are proteins that might play a role in signalling or circadian rhythm.
