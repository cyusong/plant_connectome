Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) glandular trichomes function as biochemical factories that synthesize a diverse array of specialized metabolites. Terpenoids are the most diverse class of plant specialized metabolites, with volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes playing important roles in plant defense. Although the biosynthetic pathways of volatile terpenes in tomato glandular trichomes have been well described, little is known about their regulation. Here, we demonstrate that SlMYC1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, differentially regulates mono- and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in the type VI glandular trichomes of tomato leaves and stems. SlMYC1 functions as a positive regulator of monoterpene biosynthesis in both leaf and stem trichomes but as a negative regulator of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in stem trichomes. SlMYC1 is also essential for type VI glandular trichome development, as knocking down <i>SlMYC1</i> led to the production of smaller type VI glandular trichomes at lower densities, and knocking out this gene led to their absence. Our findings reveal a role for SlMYC1 not only in type VI glandular trichome development but also in the regulation of terpene biosynthesis in tomato.
