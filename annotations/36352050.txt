Allele-specific expressed genes (ASEGs) are widespread in maize hybrid lines and play important roles of complementation of biological pathways in heterosis. Heterosis (hybrid vigor) is an important phenomenon with both theoretical and practical value. However, our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms behind heterosis is still limited. Here, we analyzed a comprehensive dataset of maize (Zea mays L.), including RNA-seq data from three hybrid-parent triplets (HPTs) and acetylated protein data from one HPT. The gene expression patterns exhibited extensive variation between the hybrids and their parents, and a substantial number of allele-specific expressed genes (ASEGs) were identified in the hybrids. Notably, ASEGs from different HPTs were significantly enriched in various conserved pathways. The parental alleles of ASEGs with fewer deleterious single-nucleotide polymorphisms were more likely to be expressed in hybrid lines than other parental alleles. ASEGs were mainly enriched in the functional gene ontology terms protein biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and metabolism. In addition, the ASEGs across the three HPTs were involved in key photosynthetic pathways and might enhance the photosynthetic efficiency of the hybrids. These findings suggest that ASEGs involved in complementary biological pathways in maize hybrids contribute to heterosis, shedding new light on the molecular mechanism of heterosis.
