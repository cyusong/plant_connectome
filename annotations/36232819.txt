Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is the most crucial substrate for numerous biochemical processes in plants. Its deprivation is a critical factor that affects plant growth and may lead to death if it lasts for a long time. However, various biotic and abiotic factors cause O<sub>2</sub> deprivation, leading to hypoxia and anoxia in plant tissues. To survive under hypoxia and/or anoxia, plants deploy various mechanisms such as fermentation paths, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), antioxidant enzymes, aerenchyma, and adventitious root formation, while nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), and nitric oxide (NO) have shown numerous beneficial roles through modulating these mechanisms. Therefore, in this review, we highlight the role of reductive pathways of NO formation which lessen the deleterious effects of oxidative damages and increase the adaptation capacity of plants during hypoxia and anoxia. Meanwhile, the overproduction of NO through reductive pathways during hypoxia and anoxia leads to cellular dysfunction and cell death. Thus, its scavenging or inhibition is equally important for plant survival. As plants are also reported to produce a potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) when supplied with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, resembling bacterial denitrification, its role during hypoxia and anoxia tolerance is discussed here. We point out that NO reduction to N<sub>2</sub>O along with the phytoglobin-NO cycle could be the most important NO-scavenging mechanism that would reduce nitro-oxidative stress, thus enhancing plants' survival during O<sub>2</sub>-limited conditions. Hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in reducing NO toxicity would not only provide insight into its role in plant physiology, but also address the uncertainties seen in the global N<sub>2</sub>O budget.
