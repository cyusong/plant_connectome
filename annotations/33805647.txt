Plants continually monitor their innate developmental status and external environment and make adjustments to balance growth, differentiation and stress responses using a complex and highly interconnected regulatory network composed of various signaling molecules and regulatory proteins. Phytohormones are an essential group of signaling molecules that work through a variety of different pathways conferring plasticity to adapt to the everchanging developmental and environmental cues. Of these, jasmonic acid (JA), a lipid-derived molecule, plays an essential function in controlling many different plant developmental and stress responses. In the past decades, significant progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie JA metabolism, perception, signal transduction and its crosstalk with other phytohormone signaling pathways. In this review, we discuss the JA signaling pathways starting from its biosynthesis to JA-responsive gene expression, highlighting recent advances made in defining the key transcription factors and transcriptional regulatory proteins involved. We also discuss the nature and degree of crosstalk between JA and other phytohormone signaling pathways, highlighting recent breakthroughs that broaden our knowledge of the molecular bases underlying JA-regulated processes during plant development and biotic stress responses.
