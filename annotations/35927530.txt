For the first time it is reported that members of the nsLTP protein family could promote viral infection by inhibiting virus-induced RNA silencing. Non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are a class of soluble proteins with low relative molecular weight and widely present in higher plants. The role of nsLTPs in biotic and abiotic stresses has been studied, but no report has shown that nsLTPs play a role in the process of viral infection. We report the function and mechanism of the classical nsLTP protein StLTP6 in viral infection. We found that StLTP6 expression was remarkably upregulated in potato infected with potato virus Y and potato virus S. The infection efficiency and virus content of StLTP6-overexpressed potato and Nicotiana benthamiana were remarkable increased. Further study found that the overexpression of StLTP6 inhibited the expression of multiple genes in the RNA silencing pathway, thereby inhibiting virus-induced RNA silencing. This result indicated that StLTP6 expression was induced during viral infection to inhibit the resistance of virus-induced RNA silencing and promote viral infection. In summary, we reported the role of StLTP6 in viral infection, broadening the biological function range of the nsLTP family and providing valuable information for the study of viral infection mechanism.
