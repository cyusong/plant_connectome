Low temperature and abscisic acid (ABA) are the two main factors that induce anthocyanin synthesis; however, their potential relationships in governing anthocyanin biosynthesis in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) seedlings remains unclear. Our study revealed the involvement of the transcription factor SlAREB1 in the low-temperature response of tomato seedlings via the ABA-dependent pathway, for a specific temperature range. The overexpression of SlAREB1 enhanced the expression of anthocyanin-related genes and the accumulation of anthocyanins, especially under low-temperature conditions, whereas silencing SlAREB1 dramatically reduced gene expression and anthocyanin accumulation. There is a direct interaction between SlAREB1 and the promoters of SlDFR and SlF3'5'H, which are structural genes that impact anthocyanin biosynthesis. SlAREB1 can regulate anthocyanins through controlling SlDFR and SlF3'5'H expression. Accordingly, SlAREB1 takes charge of regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in tomato seedlings via the ABA-dependent pathway at low temperatures.
