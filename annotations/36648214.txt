The aim was to identify subgenome-related specific responses in two types of triticale, that is, of the wheat-dominated genome (WDG) and rye-dominated genome (RDG), to water stress induced in the early phase (tillering) of plant growth. Higher activity of the primary metabolism of carbohydrates is a feature of the WDG type, while the dominance of the rye genome is associated with a higher activity of the secondary metabolism of phenolic compounds in the RDG type. The study analyzed carbohydrates and key enzymes of their synthesis, free phenolic compounds and carbohydrate-related components of the cell wall, monolignols, and shikimic acid (ShA), which is a key link between the primary and secondary metabolism of phenolic compounds. Under water stress, dominance of the wheat genome in the WDG type was manifested by an increased accumulation of the large subunit of Rubisco and sucrose phosphate synthase and a higher content of raffinose and stachyose compared with the RDG type. In dehydrated RDG plants, higher activity of L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and L-tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), as well as a higher level of ShA, free and cell wall-bound p-hydroxybenzoic acid, free homovanillic acid, free sinapic acid, and cell wall-bound syringic acid can be considered biochemical indicators of the dominance of the rye genome.
