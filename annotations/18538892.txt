Germination of barley seeds was inhibited by 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA) and 2,4-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIBOA) at concentrations greater than 0.03mmol/L, and 6-methoxy-benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one (MBOA) and benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one (BOA) at concentrations greater than 0.1mmol/L. These benzoxazinoids also inhibited the induction of alpha-amylase activity in the barley seeds, and inhibited gibberellin-induced alpha-amylase activity in de-embryonated barley seeds. Significant inhibition in the germination and alpha-amylase induction were observed as concentrations of DIMBOA, DIBOA, MBOA and BOA increased. These results suggest that DIMBOA, DIBOA, MBOA and BOA may inhibit the germination of barley seeds by inhibiting the gibberellin-induced process, leading to alpha-amylase production. The inhibitory activities of germination and alpha-amylase induction of DIMBOA and DIBOA were greater than those of their degraded substances MBOA and BOA, respectively, and the inhibitory activities of DIMBOA and MBOA were greater than those of their demethoxylated analogues DIBOA and BOA, respectively.
