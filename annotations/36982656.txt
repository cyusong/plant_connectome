Groat protein content (GPC) is a key quality trait attribute in oat. Understanding the variation of GPC in oat germplasms and identifying genomic regions associated with GPC are essential for improving this trait. In this study, the GPC of 174 diverse oat accessions was evaluated in three field trials. The results showed a wide variation in GPC, ranging from 6.97% to 22.24% in this panel. Hulless oats displayed a significantly higher GPC compared to hulled oats across all environments. A GWAS analysis was performed based on 38,313 high-quality SNPs, which detected 27 non-redundant QTLs with 41 SNPs significantly associated with GPC. Two QTLs on chromosome 6C (QTL16) and 4D (QTL11) were consistently detected in multiple environments, with QTL16 being the most significant and explaining the highest proportion of the phenotypical variation in all tested environments except in CZ20. Haplotype analysis showed that the favorable haplotypes for GPC are more prevalent in hulless oats. These findings provide a foundation for future efforts to incorporate favorable alleles into new cultivars through introgression, fine mapping, and cloning of promising QTLs.
