['21707802', 'Assembly of the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide precursor (Glc(3) Man(9)  GlcNAc(2) ) is highly conserved among eukaryotes. In contrast to yeast and  mammals, little is known about the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked  oligosaccharides and the transfer to asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides  in plants. To understand the biological function of these processes in plants we  characterized the Arabidopsis thaliana homolog of yeast ALG10, the  alpha1,2-glucosyltransferase that transfers the terminal glucose residue to the  lipid-linked precursor. Expression of an Arabidopsis ALG10-GFP fusion protein in  Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells revealed a reticular distribution  pattern resembling endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization. Analysis of  lipid-linked oligosaccharides showed that Arabidopsis ALG10 can complement the  yeast Deltaalg10 mutant strain. A homozygous Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant  (alg10-1) accumulated mainly lipid-linked Glc(2) Man(9) GlcNAc(2) and displayed a  severe protein underglycosylation defect. Phenotypic analysis of alg10-1 showed  that mutant plants have altered leaf size when grown in soil. Moreover, the  inactivation of ALG10 in Arabidopsis resulted in the activation of the unfolded  protein response, increased salt sensitivity and suppression of the phenotype of  alpha-glucosidase I-deficient plants. In summary, these data show that Arabidopsis  ALG10 is an ER-resident alpha1,2-glucosyltransferase that is required for  lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis and subsequently for normal leaf  development and abiotic stress response.', '2011 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04688.x', 'Strasser']
