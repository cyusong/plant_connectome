Nitric oxide (NO) was the first identified gaseous messenger and is now well established as a major ubiquitous signalling molecule. The rapid development of our understanding of NO biology in embryophytes came with the partial characterization of the pathways underlying its production and with the decrypting of signalling networks mediating its effects. Notably, the identification of proteins regulated by NO through nitrosation greatly enhanced our perception of NO functions. In comparison, the role of NO in algae has been less investigated. Yet, studies in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have produced key insights into NO production through the identification of NO-forming nitrite reductase and of S-nitrosated proteins. More intriguingly, in contrast to embryophytes, a few algal species possess a conserved nitric oxide synthase, the main enzyme catalysing NO synthesis in metazoans. This latter finding paves the way for a deeper characterization of novel members of the NO synthase family. Nevertheless, the typical NO-cyclic GMP signalling module transducing NO effects in metazoans is not conserved in algae, nor in embryophytes, highlighting a divergent acquisition of NO signalling between the green and the animal lineages.
