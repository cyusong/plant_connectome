MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of endogenous small RNAs, are broadly involved in plant development, morphogenesis and responses to various environmental stresses, through manipulating the cleavage, translational expression, or DNA methylation of target mRNAs. miR393 is a conserved miRNA family present in many plants, which mainly targets genes encoding the transport inhibitor response1 (TIR1)/auxin signaling F-box (AFB) auxin receptors, and thus greatly affects the auxin signal perception, Aux/IAA degradation, and related gene expression. This review introduces the advances made on the miR393/target module regulating plant development and the plant's responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. This module is valuable for genetic manipulation of optimized conditions for crop growth and development and would also be helpful in improving crop yield through molecular breeding.
