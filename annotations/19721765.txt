Biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) serve as signals mediating information between plants and their higher trophic level beneficials, such as parasitoids and predators of herbivores. We recently demonstrated with oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.) plants, herbivorous diamond-back moth (<i>Plutella xylostella</i> L. (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae)) larvae and <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> (Haliday) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) parasitoids that atmospheric pollution, i.e., elevated ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), can disturb attraction of natural enemies by plant-emitted host-induced volatile cues. Additionally, we found that the degree of herbivore feeding damage is an important contributor to this O<sub>3</sub> interference. Low feeding damage in herbivore-resistant plants was sufficient to attract <i>C. vestalis</i> females to host-damaged plants under ambient air, but this tritrophic signaling turned non-functional in the combination of low feeding damage and high O<sub>3</sub> concentration. Here we present some additional data of how climate change factors may modify feeding patterns and growth of herbivores. We further discuss how the degree of herbivore feeding damage and the tritrophic signaling interaction relaying on the herbivore-induced VOCs from attacked plants might change through direct and indirect effects of increased levels of carbon dioxide, temperature and O<sub>3</sub>.
