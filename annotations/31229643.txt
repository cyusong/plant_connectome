BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 family proteins (BZRs) are central transcription factors that govern brassinosteroid (BR)-regulated gene expression and plant growth. However, it is unclear whether there exists a BZR-independent pathway that mediates BR signaling. In this study, we found that disruption of all BZRs in Arabidopsis generated a hextuple mutant (bzr-h) displaying vegetative growth phenotypes that were almost identical to those of the null mutant of three BR receptors, bri1brl1brl3 (bri-t). By RNA sequencing, we found that global gene expression in bzr-h was unaffected by 2 h of BR treatment. The anthers of bzr-h plants were loculeless, but a similar phenotype was not observed in bri-t, suggesting that BZRs have a BR signaling-independent regulatory role in anther development. By real-time PCR and in situ hybridization, we found that the expression of SPOROCYTELESS (SPL), which encodes a transcription factor essential for anther locule development, was barely detectable in bzr-h, suggesting that BZRs regulate locule development by affecting SPL expression. Our findings reveal that BZRs are indispensable transcription factors required for both BR signaling and anther locule development, providing new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the microsporogenesis in Arabidopsis.
