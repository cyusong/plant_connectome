Paris species accumulate a large amount of steroidal saponins, which have numerous pharmacological activities and have become an essential component in many patented drugs. However, only two among all Paris species. Paris are identified as official sources due to high level of bioactive compounds. To clarify the composition of steroidal saponins and the molecular basis behind the differences between species, we investigated transcriptome and metabolic profiles of leaves and rhizomes in Paris polyphylla var. chinensis (PPC), Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis (PPY), Paris polyphylla var. stenophylla (PPS), Paris fargesii (PF), and Paris mairei (PM). Phytochemical results displayed that the accumulation of steroidal saponins was tissue- and species-specific. PF and PPS contained more steroidal saponins in leaves than rhizomes, while PPY accumulated more steroidal saponins in rhizomes than leaves. PPC and PM contained similar amounts of steroidal saponins in leaves and rhizomes. Transcriptome analysis illustrated that most differentially expressed genes related to the biosynthesis of steroidal saponins were abundantly expressed in rhizomes than leaves. Meanwhile, more biosynthetic genes had significant correlations with steroidal saponins in rhizomes than in leaves. The result of CCA indicated that ACAT, DXS, DWF1, and CYP90 constrained 97.35% of the variance in bioactive compounds in leaves, whereas CYP72, UGT73, ACAT, and GPPS constrained 98.61% of the variance in phytochemicals in rhizomes. This study provided critical information for enhancing the production of steroidal saponins by biotechnological approaches and methodologies.
