Aerobic metabolism inevitably produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide, which may cause damage to the cell. Besides this toxic effect, hydrogen peroxide has an important signaling function in plant development and response to environmental stimuli. So, the balance of toxic and signaling effects of hydrogen peroxide is highly dependent on mechanisms to adjust its level in the different cell compartments. We recently described a redox system, formed by NADPH thioredoxin reductase (NTR) and 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (1-Cys Prx), able to use the reducing power of NADPH to reduce hydrogen peroxide. This system is localized in the nucleus of wheat seed cells and probably has an important antioxidant function in aleurone and scutellum cells, which suffer oxidative stress during seed development and germination. We discuss here the possibility that the control of the level of hydrogen peroxide in the nucleus may be important to balance redox regulation of gene expression and cell death in cereal seed cells.
