Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins bind RNA and act in multiple eukaryotic processes, including RNA editing, RNA stability, and translation. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying the functional versatility of Arabidopsis thaliana proton gradient regulation3 (PGR3), a chloroplast protein harboring 27 PPR motifs. Previous studies suggested that PGR3 acts in (1) stabilization of photosynthetic electron transport L (petL) operon RNA, (2) translation of petL, and (3) translation of ndhA. We showed here that replacement of the 4th amino acid of the 12th PPR with nonpolar or charged amino acids abolished functions (1) and (2) but not (3) of PGR3 by compromising the function of this specific PPR. This discovery enabled us to knock out the RNA binding ability of individual PPR motifs. Consequently, we showed that the 16 N-terminal PPRs were sufficient for function (1) via sequence-specific RNA binding, whereas the 11 C-terminal motifs were essential for functions (2) and (3) by activating translation. We also clarified that the 14th amino acid of the 12th PPR should be positively charged to make the PPR functionally active. Our finding opens up the possibility of selectively manipulating the functions of PPR proteins.
