['10640280', 'Abcission, the natural shedding of leaves, flowers and fruits, is a fundamental  component of plant development. Abscission is a highly regulated process that  occurs at distinct zones of cells that undergo enlargement and subsequent  separation. Although some components of abscission, including accumulation of the  hormone ethylene and cell wall-degrading enzymes, have been described, the  regulatory pathways remain largely unknown. In this paper we describe a critical  component required for floral organ abscission in Arabidopsis thaliana, the  receptor-like protein kinase HAESA. Histochemical analysis of transgenic plants  harboring a HAESA promoter:: beta-glucuronidase reporter gene and in situ RNA  hybridization experiments show HAESA expression in the abscission zones where the  sepals, petals, and stamens attach to the receptacle, at the base of pedicels,  and at the base of petioles where leaves attach to the stem. Immunodetection,  immunoprecipitation, and protein kinase activity assays reveal HAESA is a plasma  membrane serine/threonine protein kinase. The reduction of function of HAESA in  transgenic plants harboring an antisense construct results in delayed abscission  of floral organs, and the severity of the phenotype is directly correlated with  the level of HAESA protein. These results demonstrate that HAESA functions in  developmentally regulated floral organ abscission.', '2000 Jan 1', 'Genes Dev', None, 'Walker']
