Phytosulfokine (PSK) is a danger-associated molecular pattern recognized by PHYTOSULFOKINE RECEPTOR 1 (PSKR1), and initiates intercellular signaling to coordinate different physiological processes, especially in the defense response to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. The activity of peptide receptors is largely influenced by different posttranslational modifications, which determines intercellular peptide signal outputs. To date, the posttranslational modification to PSKR1 remains largely unknown. Here, we show that tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) PSKR1 is regulated by the ubiquitin/proteasome degradation pathway. Using multiple protein-protein interaction and ubiquitylation analyses, we identified that plant U-box E3 ligases PUB12 and PUB13 interacted with PSKR1, among which PUB13 caused PSKR1 ubiquitylation at Lys-748 and Lys-905 sites to control PSKR1 abundance. However, this posttranslational modification was attenuated upon addition of PSK. Moreover, the disease symptoms observed in PUB13 knock-down and overexpression lines demonstrated that PUB13 significantly suppressed the PSK-initiated defense response. This highlights an important regulatory function for the turnover of a peptide receptor by E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitylation in the plant defense response.
