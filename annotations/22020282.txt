['22020282', 'The majority of eukaryotic organisms rely on molecular oxygen for respiratory  energy production. When the supply of oxygen is compromised, a variety of  acclimation responses are activated to reduce the detrimental effects of energy  depletion. Various oxygen-sensing mechanisms have been described that are thought  to trigger these responses, but they each seem to be kingdom specific and no  sensing mechanism has been identified in plants until now. Here we show that one  branch of the ubiquitin-dependent N-end rule pathway for protein degradation,  which is active in both mammals and plants, functions as an oxygen-sensing  mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified a conserved amino-terminal amino  acid sequence of the ethylene response factor (ERF)-transcription factor RAP2.12  to be dedicated to an oxygen-dependent sequence of post-translational  modifications, which ultimately lead to degradation of RAP2.12 under aerobic  conditions. When the oxygen concentration is low-as during flooding-RAP2.12 is  released from the plasma membrane and accumulates in the nucleus to activate gene  expression for hypoxia acclimation. Our discovery of an oxygen-sensing mechanism  opens up new possibilities for improving flooding tolerance in crops.', '2011 Oct 23', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature10536', 'van']
