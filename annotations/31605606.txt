Flowering transition is regulated by complex genetic networks in response to endogenous and environmental signals. Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Alternative splicing of key flowering genes has been investigated in detail over the past decade. However, few splicing factors have been identified as being involved in flowering transition. Human heterodimeric splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) consists of two subunits, U2AF35 and U2AF65, and functions in 3' splice site recognition in mRNA splicing. Recent studies reveal that Arabidopsis U2AF65a/b and U2AF35a/b play important roles in the splicing of key flowering genes. We summarize recent advances in research on splicing-regulated flowering transition by focusing on the role of Arabidopsis U2AF in the splicing of key flowering-related genes at ambient temperature and in the abscisic acid signaling pathways.
