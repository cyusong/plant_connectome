['33615694', 'Active DNA demethylation is critical for altering DNA methylation patterns and  regulating gene expression. The 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase/lyase ROS1  initiates a base-excision repair pathway for active DNA demethylation and is  required for the prevention of DNA hypermethylation at 1 000s of genomic regions  in Arabidopsis. How ROS1 is regulated and targeted to specific genomic regions is  not well understood. Here, we report the discovery of an Arabidopsis protein  complex that contains ROS1, regulates ROS1 gene expression, and likely targets  the ROS1 protein to specific genomic regions. ROS1 physically interacts with a  WD40 domain protein (RWD40), which in turn interacts with a methyl-DNA binding  protein (RMB1) as well as with a zinc finger and homeobox domain protein (RHD1).  RMB1 binds to DNA that is methylated in any sequence context, and this binding is  necessary for its function in vivo. Loss-of-function mutations in RWD40, RMB1, or  RHD1 cause DNA hypermethylation at several tested genomic regions independently  of the known ROS1 regulator IDM1. Because the hypermethylated genomic regions  include the DNA methylation monitoring sequence in the ROS1 promoter, plants  mutated in RWD40, RMB1, or RHD1 show increased ROS1 expression. Importantly, ROS1  binding to the ROS1 promoter requires RWD40, RMB1, and RHD1, suggesting that this  complex dictates ROS1 targeting to this locus. Our results demonstrate that ROS1  forms a protein complex with RWD40, RMB1, and RHD1, and that this novel complex  regulates active DNA demethylation at several endogenous loci in Arabidopsis.', '2021 Apr', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.13045', 'Zhu']
