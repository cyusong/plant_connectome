The plant viruses in the phylum <i>Negarnaviricota</i>, orders <i>Bunyavirales</i> and <i>Mononegavirales</i>, have common features of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genomes and replication in the biological vector. Due to the similarities in biology, comparative functional analysis in plant and vector hosts is helpful for understanding host-virus interactions for negative-strand RNA viruses. In this review, we will highlight recent technological advances that are breaking new ground in the study of these recalcitrant virus systems. The development of infectious clones for plant rhabdoviruses and bunyaviruses is enabling unprecedented examination of gene function in plants and these advances are also being transferred to study virus biology in the vector. In addition, genome and transcriptome projects for critical nonmodel arthropods has enabled characterization of insect response to viruses and identification of interacting proteins. Functional analysis of genes using genome editing will provide future pathways for further study of the transmission cycle and new control strategies for these viruses and their vectors.
