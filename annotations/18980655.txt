Rice dwarf virus (RDV) is a serious viral pest that is transmitted to rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) by leafhoppers and causes a dwarfism in infected plants. To identify host factors involved in the multiplication of RDV, we screened Tos17 insertion mutant lines of rice for mutants with reduced susceptibility to RDV. One mutant, designated rim1-1, did not show typical disease symptoms upon infection with RDV. The accumulation of RDV capsid proteins was also drastically reduced in inoculated rim1-1 mutant plants. Co-segregation and complementation analyses revealed that the rim1-1 mutation had been caused by insertion of Tos17 in an intron of a novel NAC gene. The rim1-1 mutant remained susceptible to the two other viruses tested, one of which is also transmitted by leafhoppers, suggesting that the multiplication rather than transmission of RDV is specifically impaired in this mutant. We propose that RIM1 functions as a host factor that is required for multiplication of RDV in rice.
