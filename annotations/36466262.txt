The natural environment of plants comprises a complex set of biotic and abiotic stresses, and plant responses to these stresses are complex as well. Plant proteomics approaches have significantly revealed dynamic changes in plant proteome responses to stress and developmental processes. Thus, we reviewed the recent advances in cotton proteomics research under changing environmental conditions, considering the progress and challenging factors. Finally, we highlight how single-cell proteomics is revolutionizing plant research at the proteomics level. We envision that future cotton proteomics research at the single-cell level will provide a more complete understanding of cotton's response to stresses.
