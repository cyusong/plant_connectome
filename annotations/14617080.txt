['14617080', 'Little is known about the genetic control of mitochondrial morphology and  dynamics in higher plants. We used a genetic screen involving fluorescence  microscopic analysis of ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS)-mutated Arabidopsis  thaliana seedlings expressing GFP targeted to mitochondria to isolate eight  mutants displaying distinct perturbations of the normal mitochondrial morphology  or distribution. We describe five mutants with distinct and unique mitochondrial  phenotypes, which map to five different loci, not previously implicated in  mitochondrial behaviour in plants. We have used a combination of forward and  reverse genetics to identify one of the genes, friendly mitochondria (FMT), a  homologue of the CluA gene of Dictyostelium discoideum, which is involved in the  correct distribution of mitochondria in the cell. The five mutants constitute a  powerful resource to aid our understanding of mitochondrial dynamics in higher  plants.', '2003 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01894.x', 'Tobin']
