To explore a possible recessive selective marker for future DNA-free genome editing by direct delivery of a CRISPR/Cas9-single guide RNA (sgRNA) ribonucleoprotein complex, we knocked out homologs of the <i>Arabidopsis</i><i>Multi-Antibiotic Resistance 1</i> (<i>MAR1</i>)<i>/RTS3</i> gene, mutations of which confer aminoglycoside resistance, in tobacco plants by an efficient <i>Agrobacterium-</i>mediated gene transfer. A <i>Cas9</i> gene was introduced into <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> and <i>Nicotiana sylvestris</i> together with an sgRNA gene for one of three different target sequences designed to perfectly match sequences in both S- and T-genome copies of <i>N. tabacum</i><i>MAR1</i> homologs (<i>NtMAR1h</i>s). All three sgRNAs directed the introduction of InDels into <i>NtMAR1h</i>s, as demonstrated by CAPS and amplicon sequencing analyses, albeit with varying efficiency. Leaves of regenerated transformant shoots were evaluated for aminoglycoside resistance on shoot-induction media containing different aminoglycoside antibiotics. All transformants tested were as sensitive to those antibiotics as non-transformed control plants, regardless of the mutation rates in <i>NtMAR1h</i>s. The <i>NtMAR1h</i>s-knockout seedlings of the T<sub>1</sub> generation showed limited aminoglycoside resistance but failed to form shoots when cultured on shoot-induction media containing kanamycin. The results suggest that, like <i>Arabidopsis MAR1</i>, <i>NtMAR1h</i>s have a role in plants' sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics, and that tobacco has some additional functional homologs.
