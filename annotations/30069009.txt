['30069009', 'Rho GTPases play crucial roles in cell polarity and pattern formation. ROPs, Rho  of plant GTPases, are widely involved in cell wall patterning in plants, yet the  molecular mechanism underlying their action remains unknown. Arabidopsis ROP11 is  locally activated to form plasma membrane domains, which direct formation of cell  wall pits in metaxylem vessel cells through interaction with cortical  microtubules. Here, we show that the pattern formation of cell wall pits is  governed by ROP activation via a reaction-diffusion mechanism. Genetic analysis  and reconstructive assays revealed that ROPGEF4/7 and ROPGAP3/4, which encode ROP  activators and inactivators, respectively, regulated the formation of  ROP-activated domains; these in turn determined the pattern of cell wall pits.  Mathematical modelling showed that ROP-activation cycle generated ROP domains by  reaction-diffusion mechanism. The model predicted that a positive feedback and  slow diffusion of ROP11-ROPGEF4 complex were required to generate ROP-activated  domains. ROPGEF4 formed a dimer that interacted with activated ROP11 in vivo,  which could provide positive feedback for ROP activation. ROPGEF4 was highly  stable on the plasma membrane and inhibited ROP11 diffusion. Our study indicated  that ROP-based reaction-diffusion system self-organizes ROP-activated domains,  thereby determines the pit pattern of metaxylem vessels.', '2018 Aug 1', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/s41598-018-29543-y', 'ORCID:']
