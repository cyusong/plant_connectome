['26237376', 'In animals and yeasts, the DEAH-box RNA-dependent ATPase Prp16 facilitates  pre-mRNA splicing. However, in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Caenorhabditis  elegans, Prp16 orthologs are not important for general pre-mRNA splicing, but are  required for gene silencing and sex determination, respectively. The CLUMSY VEIN  (CUV) gene, which encodes a unique Prp16 ortholog in Arabidopsis thaliana,  influences auxin-mediated development. A loss-of-function cuv-1 mutation tells us  that CUV does not facilitate splicing of pre-mRNA substrates indiscriminately,  but differentially effects splicing and expression of genes. Here we show that  CUV influences root-meristem maintenance and planar polarity of root-hair  positioning, both of which are processes regulated by auxin. We propose that  Arabidopsis PRP16/CUV differentially facilitates the expression of genes,  including genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, transport, perception and  signaling, and that in this way it influences auxin-mediated development.', '2015', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.1080/15592324.2015.1074369', 'Terada']
