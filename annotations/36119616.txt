TCP proteins are plant-specific transcription factors, which are involved in a broad range of physiological processes of plant growth and development. However, the origin and evolutionary history of this gene family is not fully resolved. Here, we present a genome-wide survey of <i>TCP</i> genes in 59 species (including 42 genomes and 17 transcriptomes) covering all main lineages of green plants, and reconstruct the evolutionary history of this gene family. Our results suggested that the origin of <i>TCP</i> genes predated the emergence of land plants, possibly in the common ancestor of Phragmoplastophyta. The <i>TCP</i> gene family gradually experienced a continuous expansion and grew from a few members in algae, moss and lycophytes to dozens, and sometimes over 50 members in angiosperms. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that at least four subclades (Class I and three subclades of Class II) have been occurred in the ancestor of spermatophyte (seed plant). Both dispersed duplication and segmental duplication or whole-genome duplication (WGD) contributed significantly to the expansion of the <i>TCP</i> gene family over the course of evolution. Our findings provide a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the <i>TCP</i> gene family and highlight the importance of gene duplications in the evolution of this plant-specific transcription factors.
