Plants harbor a variety of signaling molecules which are members of a vast array of signaling networks in maintaining their physiological balance. The well known members up till now are salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET), abscissic acid (ABA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are employed by plants for their adaptation to various environmental stresses in order to survive. GSH is gradually gaining importance and becoming a molecule of interest to a number of researchers especially in relation to plant defense to pathogens. Although the role of GSH in plant defense has long been known, a dearth of information still exists regarding the mechanism underlying this defense response. This review highlights on the progress made in the cross-communication of GSH with other established signaling molecules through which GSH acts in abating biotic stress
