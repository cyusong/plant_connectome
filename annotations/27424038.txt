The DUF642 gene VqDUF642 , isolated from the Chinese grape species V. quinquangularis accession Danfeng-2, participates in berry development and defense responses against Erysiphe necator and Botrytis cinerea. The proteins with domains of unknown function 642 (DUF642) comprise a large protein family according to cell wall proteomic analyses in plants. However, the works about functional characterization of DUF642s in plant development and resistance to pathogens are scarce. In this study, a gene encoding a DUF642 protein was isolated from Chinese grape V. quinquangularis accession Danfeng-2, and designated as VqDUF642. Its full-length cDNA contains a 1107-bp open reading frame corresponding to a deduced 368-amino acid protein. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis showed that VqDUF642 is highly homologous to one of the DUF642 proteins (VvDUF642) in V. vinifera. The VqDUF642 was localized to the cell wall of tobacco epidermal cells. Accumulation of VqDUF642 protein and VqDUF642 transcript abundance increased at the later stage of grape berry development in Danfeng-2. Overexpression of VqDUF642 in transgenic tomato plants accelerated plant growth and reduced susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea. Transgenic Thompson Seedless grapevine plants overexpressing VqDUF642 exhibited enhanced resistance to Erysiphe necator and B. cinerea. Moreover, VqDUF642 overexpression affected the expression of a couple of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in transgenic tomato and grapevine upon pathogen inoculation. Taken together, these results suggest that VqDUF642 is involved in plant development and defense against pathogenic infections.
