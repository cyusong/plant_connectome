['12368503', 'The conversion of putrescine to spermidine in the biosynthetic pathway of plant  polyamines is catalyzed by two closely related spermidine synthases, SPDS1 and  SPDS2, in Arabidopsis. In the yeast two-hybrid system, SPDS2 was found to  interact with SPDS1 and a novel protein, SPMS (spermine synthase), which is  homologous with SPDS2 and SPDS1. SPMS interacts with both SPDS1 and SPDS2 in  yeast and in vitro. Unlike SPDS1 and SPDS2, SPMS failed to suppress the speDelta3  deficiency of spermidine synthase in yeast. However, SPMS was able to complement  the speDelta4 spermine deficiency in yeast, indicating that SPMS is a novel  spermine synthase. The SPDS and SPMS proteins showed no homodimerization but  formed heterodimers in vitro. Pairwise coexpression of hemagglutinin- and c-Myc  epitope-labeled proteins in Arabidopsis cells confirmed the existence of  coimmunoprecipitating SPDS1-SPDS2 and SDPS2-SPMS heterodimers in vivo. The  epitope-labeled SPDS and SPMS proteins copurified with protein complexes ranging  in size from 650 to 750 kD. Our data demonstrate the existence of a metabolon  involving at least the last two steps of polyamine biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.', '2002 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.004077', 'Tiburcio']
