['17555967', 'Sexual reproduction involves epigenetic reprogramming comprising DNA methylation  and histone modifications. In addition, dynamics of HISTONE3 (H3) variant H3.3  upon fertilization are conserved in animals, suggesting an essential role. In  contrast to H3, H3.3 marks actively transcribed regions of the genome and can be  deposited in a replication-independent manner. Although H3 variants are conserved  in plants, their dynamics during fertilization have remained unexplored. We  overcame technical limitations to live imaging of the fertilization process in  Arabidopsis thaliana and studied dynamics of the male-gamete-specific H3.3 and  the centromeric Histone Three Related 12 (HTR12). The double-fertilization  process in plants produces the zygote and the embryo-nourishing endosperm. We  show that the zygote is characterized by replication-independent removal of  paternal H3.3 and homogeneous incorporation of parental chromatin complements. In  the endosperm, the paternal H3.3 is passively diluted by replication while the  paternal chromatin remains segregated apart from the maternal chromatin  (gonomery). Hence epigenetic regulations distinguish the two products of  fertilization in plants. H3.3-replication-independent dynamics and gonomery also  mark the first zygotic divisions in animal species. We thus propose the  convergent selection of parental epigenetic imbalance involving H3 variants in  sexually reproducing organisms.', '2007 Jun 19', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2007.05.019', 'Berger']
