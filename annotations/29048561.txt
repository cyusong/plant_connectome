The transport function of transfer cells is conferred by an enlarged plasma membrane area, enriched in nutrient transporters, that is supported on a scaffold of wall ingrowth (WI) papillae. Polarized plumes of elevated cytosolic Ca2+ define loci at which WI papillae form in developing adaxial epidermal transfer cells of Vicia faba cotyledons that are induced to trans-differentiate when the cotyledons are placed on culture medium. We evaluated the hypothesis that vesicle trafficking along a Ca2+-regulated remodelled actin network is the mechanism that underpins this outcome. Polarized to the outer periclinal cytoplasm, a Ca2+-dependent remodelling of long actin bundles into short, thin bundles was found to be essential for assembling WI papillae but not the underlying uniform wall layer. The remodelled actin network directed polarized vesicle trafficking to sites of WI papillae construction, and a pharmacological study indicated that both exo- and endocytosis contributed to assembly of the papillae. Potential candidates responsible for the Ca2+-dependent actin remodelling, along with those underpinning polarized exo- and endocyotosis, were identified in a transcriptome RNAseq database generated from the trans-differentiating epidermal cells. Of most significance, endocytosis was controlled by up-regulated expression of a dynamin-like isoform. How a cycle of localized exo- and endocytosis, regulated by Ca2+-dependent actin remodelling, assembles WI papillae is discussed.
