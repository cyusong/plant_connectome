['12000677', 'We identified an Arabidopsis mutant, incomplete root hair elongation (ire), whose  root hairs are about 40% shorter than the wild type owing to the early cessation  of their growth. In contrast, the hy5 mutant has root hairs about twice as long  as the wild type, possibly because of delayed cessation of growth. Thus IRE and  HY5 are likely to modify the duration of growth of root hairs. We cloned the IRE  locus using the T-DNA tagged line. The IRE locus encodes a protein that includes  a serine/threonine protein kinase domain. The primary structure of this kinase  domain shows significant similarity to a group of protein kinases among various  eukaryotes. In the Arabidopsis genome there are at least three genes that are  closely related to IRE. The IRE transcript was detected in every organ examined.  However, the IRE promoter-GUS fusion gene was strongly expressed in the  elongating root hair cells, suggesting the cell-autonomous function of IRE in  root hairs. GUS activity was also detected in pollen grains, which develop by tip  growth, suggesting that IRE has a common role in the tip growth of plant cells.', '2002 May', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2002.01290.x', 'Okada']
