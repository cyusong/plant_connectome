Application of methanol (MeOH) inhibits photorespiration and enhances growth and yield in C3 plants. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we investigated the effects of foliar application of MeOH (30%, v/v) on glycolate oxidase (GO) activity and photorespiratory intermediates in cotton leaves in a field experiment. MeOH treatment significantly inhibited GO activity (by 30% compared with the controls). We also found that endogenous glyoxylate, a photorespiratory intermediate, increased and glycine decreased significantly in MeOH-treated plants. Serine increased significantly in MeOH-treated plants. These results thus demonstrated that exogenous MeOH can modulate GO activity and the production of photorespiratory intermediates, and sheds new lights on our current understanding of how exogenous MeOH inhibits photorespiration and enhances the growth and yield of C3 plants such as cotton.
