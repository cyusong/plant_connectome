['14605234', 'The 5-methylcytosines (m5C) play a critical role in epigenetic control, often  being recognized by proteins containing a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD).  Database screening has identified at least 12 putative methyl-CpG-binding  proteins from Arabidopsis; we have isolated corresponding cDNAs for seven of  them. Despite variation in size and amino acid sequence, all seven proteins  exclusively migrate into the nucleus as revealed by green fluorescent protein  fusion protein assay, suggesting a relationship with chromatin structure.  However, DNA-binding assays using bacterially expressed proteins and synthetic  oligonucleotides containing m5C in CpGs showed only one to specifically bind,  designated AtMBD5. Further analysis showed that AtMBD5 efficiently binds to m5C  in CpNpN (N is A, T, or C) but not in CpNpG sequences, both frequently found in  plant DNA. The other six proteins showed either nonspecific DNA binding or no  ability to recognize m5C. RNA-blot hybridization and immunoblot analysis  indicated AtMBD5 to be present essentially in all tissues. Using green  fluorescent protein driven by the authentic promoter, AtMBD5 was found to be  actively expressed in pistils and root tips. Because m5Cs in CpG and CpNpN are  considered to function in gene expression and gene silencing, respectively, the  present results suggest that AtMBD5 may have distinct functions in regulation  and/or self defense of genes in actively proliferating cells.', '2003 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.026708', 'Sano']
