Foliar water uptake (FWU), the direct uptake of water into leaves, is a global phenomenon, having been observed in an increasing number of plant species. Despite the growing recognition of its functional relevance, our understanding of how FWU occurs and which foliar surface structures are implicated, is limited. In the present study, fluorescent and ionic tracers, as well as microcomputed tomography, were used to assess potential pathways for water entry in leaves of beech, a widely distributed tree species from European temperate regions. Although none of the tracers entered the leaf through the stomatal pores, small amounts of silver precipitation were observed in some epidermal cells, indicating moderate cuticular uptake. Trichomes, however, were shown to absorb and redistribute considerable amounts of ionic and fluorescent tracers. Moreover, microcomputed tomography indicated that 72% of empty trichomes refilled during leaf surface wetting and microscopic investigations revealed that trichomes do not have a cuticle but are covered with a pectin-rich cell wall layer. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that foliar trichomes, which exhibit strong hygroscopic properties as a result of their structural and chemical design, constitute a major FWU pathway in beech.
