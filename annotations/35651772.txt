Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a staple crop and a major source of vegetable protein and vegetable oil. The growth of soybean is dramatically inhibited by salt stress, especially by the excessive toxic Na<sup>+</sup>. Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1) is the only extensively characterized Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter in multiple plant species so far. However, the role of GmSOS1 in soybean salt stress responses remains unclear. Herein, we created three <i>gmsos1</i> mutants using the CRISPR-Cas9 system in soybean. We found a significant accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in the roots of the <i>gmsos1</i> mutants, resulting in the imbalance of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, which links to impaired Na<sup>+</sup> efflux and increased K<sup>+</sup> efflux in the roots of the <i>gmsos1</i> mutants under salt stress. Compared to the wild type, our RNA-seq analysis revealed that the roots of the <i>gmsos1-1</i> showed preferential up and downregulation of ion transporters under salt stress, supporting impaired stress detection or an inability to develop a comprehensive response to salinity in the <i>gmsos1</i> mutants. Our findings indicate that the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger GmSOS1 plays a critical role in soybean salt tolerance by maintaining Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and provides evidence for molecular breeding to improve salt tolerance in soybean and other crops.
