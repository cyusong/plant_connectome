Plants are often exposed not only to short-term (S-) heat stress but also to diurnal long-term (L-) heat stress over several consecutive days. To reveal the mechanisms underlying L-heat stress tolerance, we here used a forward genetic screen for sensitive to long-term heat (sloh) mutants and isolated sloh4. The mutant was hypersensitive to L-heat stress but not to S-heat stress. The causal gene of sloh4 was identical to MIP3 encoding a member of the MAIGO2 (MAG2) tethering complex, which is composed of the MAG2, MIP1, MIP2 and MIP3 subunits and is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Although sloh4/mip3 was hypersensitive to L-heat stress, the sensitivity of the mag2-3 and mip1-1 mutants was similar to that of the wild type (WT). Under L-heat stress, the ER stress and the following unfolded protein response (UPR) were more pronounced in sloh4 than in the WT. Transcript levels of bZIP60-regulated UPR genes were strongly increased in sloh4 under L-heat stress. Two processes known to be mediated by INOSITOL REQUIRING ENZYME1 (IRE1) - accumulation of the spliced bZIP60 transcript and a decrease in the transcript levels of PR4 and PRX34, encoding secretory proteins - were observed in sloh4 in response to L-heat stress. These findings suggest that misfolded proteins generated in sloh4 under L-heat stress may be recognized by IRE1 but not by bZIP28, resulting in the initiation of the UPR via activated bZIP60. Therefore, it would be possible that only MIP3 in the MAG2 complex has an additional function in L-heat tolerance, which is not related to the ER-Golgi vesicle tethering.
