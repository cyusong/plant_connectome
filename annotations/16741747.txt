When maize coleoptiles were unilaterally exposed to red light (7.9 micromol m(-2)s(-1) for 5 min), 3 h after treatment IAA levels in coleoptiles decreased in all regions, from top to basal, with levels about 60% of dark controls. Localized irradiation in the 5 mm top zone was sufficient to cause the same extent of IAA reduction in the tips to that in the tips of whole irradiated shoots. When coleoptiles were treated with N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), an accumulation of IAA in the tip and a decrease of diffusible IAA from tips were simultaneously detected. IAA accumulation in red-light treated coleoptiles by NPA was much lower than that of dark controls. NPA treatment did not affect the content of conjugated IAA in either dark or light treated coleoptile tips. When (13)C(11) (15)N(2)-tryptophan (Trp) was applied to the top of coleoptiles, substantial amounts of stable isotope were incorporated into free IAA in dark and red-light treated coleoptile tips. The ratio of incorporation was slightly lower in red-light treated coleoptile tips than that in dark controls. The label could not be detected in conjugated IAA. The rate of basipetal transport of IAA was about 10 mm h(-1) and the velocity was not affected by red light. These results strongly suggest that red light does not affect the rates of conversion of free IAA to the conjugate form or of the basipetal transport, but just reduces the IAA level in the tips, probably inhibited by IAA biosynthesis from Trp in this region.
