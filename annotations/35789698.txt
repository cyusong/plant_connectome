The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are a large superfamily of transcription factors, and play a central role in a wide range of metabolic, physiological, and developmental processes in higher organisms. However, systematic investigation of <i>bHLH</i> gene family in cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz) has not been reported. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide survey and identified 148 <i>MebHLH</i>s genes were unevenly harbored in 18 chromosomes. Through phylogenetic analyses along with <i>Arabidopsis</i> counterparts, these <i>MebHLHs</i> genes were divided into 19 groups, and each gene contains a similar structure and conserved motifs. Moreover, many <i>cis</i>-acting regulatory elements related to various defense and stress responses showed in <i>MebHLH</i> genes. Interestingly, transcriptome data analyses unveiled 117 <i>MebHLH</i> genes during postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD) process of cassava tuberous roots, while 65 <i>MebHLH</i> genes showed significantly change. Meanwhile, the relative quantitative analysis of 15 <i>MebHLH</i> genes demonstrated that they were sensitive to PPD, suggesting they may involve in PPD process regulation. Cyanogenic glucosides (CGs) biosynthesis during PPD process was increased, silencing of <i>MebHLH72</i> and <i>MebHLH114</i> showed that linamarin content was significantly decreased in the leaves. To summarize, the genome-wide identification and expression profiling of <i>MebHLH</i> candidates pave a new avenue for uderstanding their function in PPD and CGs biosynthesis, which will accelerate the improvement of PPD tolerance and decrease CGs content in cassava tuberous roots.
