Universal stress proteins (USPs) exist across a wide range of species and are vital for survival under stressful conditions. Due to the increasingly harsh global environmental conditions, it is increasingly important to study the role of USPs in achieving stress tolerance. This review discusses the role of USPs in organisms from three aspects: (1) organisms generally have multiple USP genes that play specific roles at different developmental periods of the organism, and, due to their ubiquity, USPs can be used as an important indicator to study species evolution; (2) a comparison of the structures of USPs reveals that they generally bind ATP or its analogs at similar sequence positions, which may underlie the regulatory role of USPs; and (3) the functions of USPs in species are diverse, and are generally directly related to the stress tolerance. In microorganisms, USPs are associated with cell membrane formation, whereas in plants they may act as protein chaperones or RNA chaperones to help plants withstand stress at the molecular level and may also interact with other proteins to regulate normal plant activities. This review will provide directions for future research, focusing on USPs to provide clues for the development of stress-tolerant crop varieties and for the generation of novel green pesticide formulations in agriculture, and to better understand the evolution of drug resistance in pathogenic microorganisms in medicine.
