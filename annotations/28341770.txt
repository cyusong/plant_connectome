A simple model combining leaf hydraulics and abscisic acid sensitivity can predict stomatal dynamics to short-term changes in plant water status in a conifer.

Gene: !affects! Stomatal dynamics 
Gene: !synthesizes! Abscisic acid 
Gene: !enhances! Leaf hydraulics 
Gene: !represses! Short-term changes in plant water status
