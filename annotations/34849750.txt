Seed storage proteins (SSPs) are of great importance in plant science and agriculture, particularly in cereal crops, due to their nutritional value and their impact on food properties. During seed maturation, massive amounts of SSPs are synthesized and deposited either within protein bodies derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, or into specialized protein storage vacuoles (PSVs). The processing and trafficking of SSPs vary among plant species, tissues, and even developmental stages, as well as being influenced by SSP composition. The different trafficking routes, which affect the amount of SSPs that seeds accumulate and their composition and modifications, rely on a highly dynamic and functionally specialized endomembrane system. Although the general steps in SSP trafficking have been studied in various plants, including cereals, the detailed underlying molecular and regulatory mechanisms are still elusive. In this review, we discuss the main endomembrane routes involved in SSP trafficking to the PSV in Arabidopsis and other eudicots, and compare and contrast the SSP trafficking pathways in major cereal crops, particularly in rice and maize. In addition, we explore the challenges and strategies for analyzing the endomembrane system in cereal crops.
