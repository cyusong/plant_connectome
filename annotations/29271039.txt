Classical DNAJ proteins are co-chaperones that together with HSP70s control protein homeostasis. All three classical types of DNAJ proteins (DNAJA, DNAJB and DNAJC types) possess the J-domain for interaction with HSP70. DNAJA proteins contain, in addition, both the zinc-finger motif and the C-terminal domain which are involved in substrate binding, while DNAJB retains only the latter and DNAJC comprises only the J-domain. There is increasing evidence that some of the activities of DNAJ proteins do not require the J-domain, highlighting the functional significance of the other two domains. Indeed, the so-called DNAJ-like proteins with a degenerate J-domain have been previously coined as DNAJD proteins, and also proteins containing only a DNAJ-like zinc-finger motif appear to be involved in protein homeostasis. Therefore, we propose to extend the classification of DNAJ-related proteins into three different groups. The DNAJD type comprises proteins with a J-like domain only, and has 15 members in Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas proteins of the DNAJE (33 Arabidopsis members) and DNAJF (three Arabidopsis members) types contain a DNAJA-like zinc-finger domain and DNAJA/B-like C-terminal domain, respectively. Here, we provide an overview of the entire repertoire of these proteins in A. thaliana with respect to their physiological function and possible evolutionary origin.
