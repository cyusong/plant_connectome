Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) catalyses the conversion of atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds during photosynthesis. Despite its pivotal role in plant metabolism, Rubisco is an inefficient enzyme and has therefore been a key target in bioengineering efforts to improve crop yields. Much has been learnt about the complex cellular machinery involved in Rubisco assembly and metabolic repair over recent years. The simple form of Rubisco found in certain bacteria and dinoflagellates comprises two large subunits, and generally requires the chaperonin system for folding. However, the evolution of hexadecameric Rubisco, which comprises eight large and eight small subunits, from its dimeric precursor has rendered Rubisco in most plants, algae, cyanobacteria and proteobacteria dependent on an array of additional factors. These auxiliary factors include several chaperones for assembly as well as ATPases of the AAA+ family for functional maintenance. An integrated view of the pathways underlying Rubisco biogenesis and repair will pave the way for efforts to improve the enzyme with the goal of increasing crop yields.
