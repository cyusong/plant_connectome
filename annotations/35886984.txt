Freezing stress is a major factor limiting production and geographical distribution of temperate crops. Elongator is a six subunit complex with histone acetyl-transferase activity and is involved in plant development and defense responses in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. However, it is unknown whether and how an elongator responds to freezing stress in plants. In this study, we found that wheat elongator subunit 4 (TaELP4) negatively regulates freezing tolerance through ethylene signaling. <i>TaELP4</i> promoter contained cold response elements and was up-regulated in freezing stress. Subcellular localization showed that TaELP4 and AtELP4 localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Silencing of <i>TaELP4</i> in wheat with BSMV-mediated VIGS approach significantly elevated tiller survival rate compared to control under freezing stress, but ectopic expression of <i>TaELP4</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> increased leaf damage and survival rate compared with Col-0. Further results showed that <i>TaELP4</i> positively regulated <i>ACS2</i> and <i>ACS6</i> transcripts, two main limiting enzymes in ethylene biosynthesis. The determination of ethylene content showed that <i>TaELP4</i> overexpression resulted in more ethylene accumulated than Col-0 under freezing stress. Epigenetic research showed that histone H3K9/14ac levels significantly increased in coding/promoter regions of <i>AtACS2</i> and <i>AtACS6</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. RT-qPCR assays showed that the EIN2/EIN3/EIL1-CBFs-COR pathway was regulated by <i>TaELP4</i> under freezing stress. Taken together, our results suggest that TaELP4 negatively regulated plant responses to freezing stress via heightening histone acetylation levels of <i>ACS2</i> and <i>ACS6</i> and increasing their transcription and ethylene accumulation.
