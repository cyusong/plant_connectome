Plant defense responses under unfavorable conditions are often associated with reduced growth. However, the mechanisms underlying the growth-defense tradeoff remain to be fully elucidated, especially at the transcriptional level. Here, we revealed a Cys2/His2-type zinc finger transcription factor, namely, ZAT18, which played dual roles in plant immunity and growth by oppositely regulating the signaling of defense- and growth-related hormones. ZAT18 was first identified as a salicylic acid (SA)-inducible gene and was required for plant responses to SA in this study. In addition, we observed that ZAT18 enhanced the plant immunity with growth penalties that may have been achieved by activating SA signaling and repressing auxin signaling. Further transcriptome analysis of the <i>zat18</i> mutant showed that the biological pathways of defense-related hormones, including SA, ethylene and abscisic acid, were repressed and that the biological pathways of auxin and cytokinin, which are growth-related hormones, were activated by abolishing the function of <i>ZAT18</i>. The ZAT18-mediated regulation of hormone signaling was further confirmed using qRT-PCR. Our results explored a mechanism by which plants handle defense and growth at the transcriptional level under stress conditions.
