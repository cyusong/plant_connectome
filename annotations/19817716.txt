['19817716', 'Oxygen-evolving chloroplasts possess their own iron-sulfur cluster assembly  proteins including members of the SUF (sulfur mobilization) and the NFU family.  Recently, the chloroplast protein HCF101 (high chlorophyll fluorescence 101) has  been shown to be essential for the accumulation of the membrane complex  Photosystem I and the soluble ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductases, both containing  [4Fe-4S] clusters. The protein belongs to the FSC-NTPase  ([4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing P-loop NTPase) superfamily, several members of which  play a crucial role in Fe/S cluster biosynthesis. Although the C-terminal  ISC-binding site, conserved in other members of the FSC-NTPase family, is not  present in chloroplast HCF101 homologues using Mossbauer and EPR spectroscopy, we  provide evidence that HCF101 binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster. 55Fe incorporation studies  of mitochondrially targeted HCF101 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae confirmed the  assembly of an Fe/S cluster in HCF101 in an Nfs1-dependent manner. Site-directed  mutagenesis identified three HCF101-specific cysteine residues required for  assembly and/or stability of the cluster. We further demonstrate that the  reconstituted cluster is transiently bound and can be transferred from HCF101 to  a [4Fe-4S] apoprotein. Together, our findings suggest that HCF101 may serve as a  chloroplast scaffold protein that specifically assembles [4Fe-4S] clusters and  transfers them to the chloroplast membrane and soluble target proteins.', '2009 Dec 14', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BJ20091290', 'Meurer']
