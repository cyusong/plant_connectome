Twelve Arabidopsis accessions were challenged with Plum pox potyvirus (PPV) isolates representative of the four PPV strains. Each accession supported local and systemic infection by at least some of the PPV isolates, but high variability was observed in the behavior of the five PPV isolates or the 12 Arabidopsis accessions. Resistance to local infection or long-distance movement occurred in about 40% of all the accession-isolate combinations analyzed. Except for Nd-1, all accessions showed resistance to local infection by PPV-SoC; in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) accession, this resistance was compromised by sgt1 and rar1 mutations, suggesting that it could be controlled by an R gene-mediated resistance pathway. While most of the susceptible accessions were symptomless, PPV induced severe symptoms on inflorescences in C24, Ler, and Bay-0 as early as 15 days after inoculation. Genetic analyses indicated that these interaction phenotypes are controlled by different genetic systems. The restriction of long-distance movement of PPV-El Amar and of another member of genus Potyvirus, Lettuce mosaic virus, in Col-0 requires the RTM genes, indicating for the first time that the RTM system may provide a broad range, potyvirus-specific protection against systemic infection. The restriction to PPV-PS long-distance movement in Cvi-1 is controlled by a single recessive gene, designated rpv1, which was mapped to chromosome 1. The nuclear inclusion polymerase b-capsid protein region of the viral genome appears to be responsible for the ability of PPV-R to overcome rpv1-mediated resistance.
