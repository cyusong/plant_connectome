In Hevea brasiliensis, laticifers produce and accumulate rubber particles. Despite observation using histochemical methods, development stage structure and structures with ceasing functions have rarely been described. Spectral confocal laser scanning microscopy with Nile red staining simplifies laticifer structure observation in tangential sections while enhancing the resolution. Laticifer and ray images were extracted from unmixed images and used to monitor changes during growth. A laticifer network structure developed from increased anastomoses between adjoining laticifers outside of the conducting phloem, but because of increased radial division and growth of rays, the network structure ruptured and disintegrated. We also investigated immunohistochemical localization of two rubber particle-associated proteins in the laticifers: small rubber particle protein (SRPP) and rubber elongation factor (REF). Mature bark test results show that SRPP is localized only in the laticifer layers in the conducting phloem; REF is localized in all laticifer layers. Because SRPP plays a positive role in rubber biosynthesis, results show that the rubber biosynthesis capability of laticifers is concentrated where rays and the sieve tube actively transport metabolites.
