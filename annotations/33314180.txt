Recognition at the plasma membrane of danger signals (elicitors) belonging to the classes of the microbe/pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns is a key event in pathogen sensing by plants and is associated with a rapid activation of immune responses. Different cellular compartments, including plasma membrane, chloroplasts, nuclei and mitochondria, are involved in the immune cellular program. However, how pathogen sensing is transmitted throughout the cell remains largely to be uncovered. Arabidopsis NPK1-related Proteins (ANPs) are mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases previously shown to have a role in immunity. In this article, we studied the in vivo intracellular dynamics of ANP1- and ANP3-GFP fusions and found that under basal physiological conditions both proteins are present in the cytosol, while ANP3 is also localized in mitochondria. After elicitor perception, both proteins are present also in the plastids and nuclei, revealing a localization pattern that is so far unique. The N-terminal region of the protein kinases is responsible for their localization in mitochondria and plastids. Moreover, we found that the localization of ANPs coincides with the sites of elicitor-induced ROS accumulation and that plants lacking ANP function do not accumulate intracellular ROS.
