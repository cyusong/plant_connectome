Flavonoids are a signature class of secondary metabolites formed from a relatively simple collection of scaffolds. They are extensively decorated by chemical reactions including glycosylation, methylation, and acylation. They are present in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables and as such in Western populations it is estimated that 20-50 mg of flavonoids are consumed daily per person. In planta they have demonstrated to contribute to both flower color and UV protection. Their consumption has been suggested to presenta wide range of health benefits. Recent technical advances allowing affordable whole genome sequencing, as well as a better inventory of species-by-species chemical diversity, have greatly advanced our understanding as to how flavonoid biosynthesis pathways vary across species. In parallel, reverse genetics combined with detailed molecular phenotyping is currently allowing us to elucidate the functional importance of individual genes and metabolites and by this means to provide further mechanistic insight into their biological roles. Here we provide an inventory of current knowledge of pathways of flavonoid biosynthesis in both the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and a range of crop species, including tomato, maize, rice, and bean.
