The development of viable pollen determines male fertility, and is crucial for reproduction in flowering plants. Phytochrome interacting factor 3 (PIF3) acts as a central regulator of plant growth and development, but its relationship with pollen development has not been determined. Through genetic, histological and transcriptomic analyses, we identified an essential role for SlPIF3 in regulating tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) pollen development. Knocking out SlPIF3 using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 resulted in pollen mitosis I arrest, and a failure to form viable pollen. We further demonstrated that both glutamate synthase 1 (SlGLT1) and cell wall invertase 9 (SlCWIN9), involved in auxin and sugar homeostasis, respectively, colocalised with SlPIF3 in the anthers and were directly regulated by SlPIF3. Knockout of either SlGLT1 or SlCWIN9 phenocopied the pollen phenotype of SlPIF3 knockout (Slpif3) lines. Slpif3 fertility was partially restored by exogenous auxin indole-3-acetic acid in a dose-dependent manner. This study reveals a mechanism by which SlPIF3 regulates pollen development and highlights a new strategy for creating hormone-regulated genic male sterile lines for tomato hybrid seed production.
