The chloroplast ribosome is a large and dynamic ribonucleoprotein machine that is composed of the 30S and 50S subunits. Although the components of the chloroplast ribosome have been identified in the last decade, the molecular mechanisms driving chloroplast ribosome biogenesis remain largely elusive. Here, we show that RNA helicase 22 (RH22), a putative DEAD RNA helicase, is involved in chloroplast ribosome assembly in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). A loss of RH22 was lethal, whereas a knockdown of RH22 expression resulted in virescent seedlings with clear defects in chloroplast ribosomal RNA (rRNA) accumulation. The precursors of 23S and 4.5S, but not 16S, rRNA accumulated in rh22 mutants. Further analysis showed that RH22 was associated with the precursors of 50S ribosomal subunits. These results suggest that RH22 may function in the assembly of 50S ribosomal subunits in chloroplasts. In addition, RH22 interacted with the 50S ribosomal protein RPL24 through yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, and it was also bound to a small 23S rRNA fragment encompassing RPL24-binding sites. This action of RH22 may be similar to, but distinct from, that of SrmB, a DEAD RNA helicase that is involved in the ribosomal assembly in Escherichia coli, which suggests that DEAD RNA helicases and rRNA structures may have coevolved with respect to ribosomal assembly and function.
