['26935351', "Heterotrimeric G-proteins comprised of Galpha, Gbeta and Ggamma subunits are important  signal transducers in all eukaryotes. In plants, G-proteins affect multiple  biotic and abiotic stress responses, as well as many developmental processes,  even though their repertoire is significantly limited compared with that in  metazoan systems. One canonical and three extra-large Galpha, 1 Gbeta and 3 Ggamma proteins  represent the heterotrimeric G-protein complex in Arabidopsis, and a single  regulatory protein, RGS1, is one of the few known biochemical regulators of this  signaling complex. This quantitative disparity between the number of signaling  components and the range of processes they influence is rather intriguing. We now  present evidence that the phospholipase Dalpha1 protein is a key component and  modulator of the G-protein complex in affecting a subset of signaling pathways.  We also show that the same G-protein subunits and their modulators exhibit  distinct physiological and genetic interactions depending on specific signaling  and developmental pathways. Such developmental plasticity and interaction  specificity likely compensates for the lack of multiplicity of individual  subunits, and helps to fine tune the plants' responses to constantly changing  environments.", '2016 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13151', 'Pandey']
