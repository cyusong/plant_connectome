Microspores develop inside the anther, where they are surrounded by nourishing tapetal cells. However, many cellular processes occurring during microspore development in the locule are poorly characterized. The actin cytoskeleton is known to play a crucial role in various aspects of the plant developmental process. During pollen tube tip growth, actin cytoskeleton serves as an efficient molecular transportation track, although how it functions in pollen development is unknown. The plant actin bundler PLIM2s have been shown to regulate actin bundling in different cells. Here, we investigate the biological function of three Arabidopsis pollen-specific LIM proteins, PLIM2a, PLIM2b, and PLIM2c (collectively, PLIM2s), in pollen development and tube growth. Variable degrees of suppressed expression of the PLIM2s by RNA interference resulted in aberrant phenotypes. Complete suppression of the PLIM2s totally disrupted pollen development, producing abortive pollen grains and rendering the transgenic plants sterile. Partial suppression of the PLIM2s arrested pollen tube growth to a lesser extent, resulting in short and swollen pollen tubes. Finally, the PLIM2c promoter initiated expression in pollen during stamen filament elongation, and the PLIM2c protein was located on particle structures in the developing pollen grains in Arabidopsis. These suggest that the actin bundler, PLIM2s, are an important factor for Arabidopsis pollen development and tube growth.
