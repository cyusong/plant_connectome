Abscisic acid (ABA) plays crucial roles in plant development and adaption to environmental stresses. The ABA-responsive element binding protein/ABRE-binding factor and ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (AREB/ABF/ABI5) gene subfamily members, which belong to the basic domain/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors family, participate in the ABA-mediated signaling pathway by regulating the expression of their target genes. However, information about potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) AREB/ABF/ABI5 subfamily members remains scarce. Here, seven putative <i>AREB/ABF/ABI5</i> members were identified in the potato genome. Sequences alignment revealed that these members shared high protein sequence similarity, especially in the bZIP region, indicating that they might possess overlapping roles in regulating gene expression. Subcellular localization analysis illustrated that all seven AREB/ABF/ABI5 members were localized in the nucleus. Transactivation activity assays in yeast demonstrated that these AREB/ABF/ABI5 members possessed distinct transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) confirmed that all of these AREB/ABF/ABI5 members could have an affinity to ABRE in vitro. The expression patterns of these <i>AREB/ABF/ABI5</i> genes showed that they were in response to ABA or osmotic stresses in varying degrees. Moreover, most <i>AREB/ABF/ABI5</i> genes were induced during stolon swelling. Overall, these results provide the first comprehensive identification of the potato AREB/ABF/ABI5 subfamily and would facilitate further functional characterization of these subfamily members in future work.
