<i>Sapindus</i> is an important forest tree genus with utilization in biodiesel, biomedicine, and it harbors great potential for biochemical engineering applications. For advanced breeding of <i>Sapindus</i>, it is necessary to evaluate the genetic diversity and construct a rationally designed core germplasm collection. In this study, the genetic diversity and population structure of <i>Sapindus</i> were conducted with 18 expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers in order to establish a core germplasm collection from 161 <i>Sapindus</i> accessions. The population of <i>Sapindus</i> showed high genetic diversity and significant population structure. Interspecific genetic variation was significantly higher than intraspecific variation in the <i>Sapindus mukorossi</i>, <i>Sapindus delavayi</i>, and combined <i>Sapindus rarak</i> plus <i>Sapindus rarak</i> var. <i>velutinus</i> populations. <i>S. mukorossi</i> had abundant genetic variation and showed a specific pattern of geographical variation, whereas <i>S. delavayi</i>, <i>S. rarak</i>, and <i>S. rarak</i> var. <i>velutinus</i> showed less intraspecific variation. A core germplasm collection was created that contained 40% of genetic variation in the initial population, comprising 53 <i>S. mukorossi</i> and nine <i>S. delavayi</i> lineages, as well as single representatives of <i>S. rarak</i> and <i>S. rarak</i> var. <i>velutinus.</i> These results provide a germplasm basis and theoretical rationale for the efficient management, conservation, and utilization of <i>Sapindus</i>, as well as genetic resources for joint genomics research in the future.
