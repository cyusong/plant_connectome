['33601051', 'Nitrate-induced Ca(2+) signaling is crucial for the primary nitrate response in  plants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the generation of the  nitrate-specific calcium signature remains unknown. We report here that a cyclic  nucleotide-gated channel (CNGC) protein, CNGC15, and the nitrate transceptor  (NRT1.1) constitute a molecular switch that controls calcium influx depending on  nitrate levels. The expression of CNGC15 is induced by nitrate, and its protein  is localized at the plasma membrane after establishment of young seedlings. We  found that disruption of CNGC15 results in the loss of the nitrate-induced Ca(2+)  signature (primary nitrate response) and retards root growth, reminiscent of the  phenotype observed in the nrt1.1 mutant. We further showed that CNGC15 is an  active Ca(2+)-permeable channel that physically interacts with the NRT1.1 protein  in the plasma membrane. Importantly, we discovered that CNGC15-NRT1.1 interaction  silences the channel activity of the heterocomplex, which dissociates upon a rise  in nitrate levels, leading to reactivation of the CNGC15 channel. The dynamic  interactions between CNGC15 and NRT1.1 therefore control the channel activity and  Ca(2+) influx in a nitrate-dependent manner. Our study reveals a new  nutrient-sensing mechanism that utilizes a nutrient transceptor-channel complex  assembly to couple nutrient status to a specific Ca(2+) signature.', '2021 May 3', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2021.02.005', 'Li']
