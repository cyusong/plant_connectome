The rye genome has a large size with a high level of cytosine methylation, which makes it particularly convenient for studying the occurrence of potential cytosine demethylation intermediates. Both the global level of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by the ELISA test and the mass spectrometry method were analyzed in four rye species: Secale cereale, Secale strictum, Secale sylvestre, and Secale vavilovii. The amount of 5hmC showed the interspecific variation, being also variable among organs, i.e. coleoptiles, roots, leaves, stems, and caryopses. 5-Formylcytosine (5fC), 5-carboxycytosine (5caC), 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) were also found to be present in the DNA of all species; their global level varied among species and organs. The 5hmC level clearly correlated with the 5-methylcytosine (5mC) quantity. The mass spectrometry analysis, carried out on the 5mC enriched fraction supported this relationship. Highly methylated sequences also contained higher amounts of 5fC and most of all 5hmU, but not 5caC. The analysis of the distribution of 5hmC in chromosomes distinctly indicated the co-localization of 5mC with 5hmC in the same chromosomal regions. The regularities in the levels of 5hmC and other rare modifications of bases in the DNA may indicate that they play a role in the regulation of the rye genome.
