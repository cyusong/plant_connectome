['21297037', 'Following the endosymbiotic acquisition of mitochondria by eukaryotic cells, most  of the genes in this organelle were transferred to the nucleus. To maintain  mitochondrial biogenesis and function, nuclear and mitochondrial genomes require  regulated and coordinated expression. In plant organelles, nuclear-encoded  proteins targeted to the organelles control posttranscriptional and  posttranslational mechanisms. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are good  candidates to play such regulatory roles. Here, we identify PNM1 (for PPR protein  localized to the nucleus and mitochondria 1), a novel PPR protein that is dual  localized to mitochondria and nuclei in Arabidopsis thaliana, as observed by  green fluorescent protein fusions and immunodetection on subcellular fractions  and on histological sections. Genetic complementation showed that loss of PNM1  function in mitochondria, but not in nuclei, is lethal for the embryo. In  mitochondria, it is associated with polysomes and may play a role in translation.  A genetic screen in yeast identified protein partners of PNM1. These partners,  the nucleosome assembly protein NAP1, and the transcription factor TCP8 interact  with PNM1 in the nucleus in planta. Furthermore, TCP8 can bind the promoter of  PNM1. This suggests that PNM1 might be involved in the regulation of its own gene  expression in the nucleus and could thus play a role in gene expression  adjustments between mitochondria and the nucleus.', '2011 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.081638', 'Giege']
