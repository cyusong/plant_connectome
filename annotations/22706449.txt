['22706449', 'Xylan is a major component of the plant cell wall and the most abundant  noncellulosic component in the secondary cell walls that constitute the largest  part of plant biomass. Dicot glucuronoxylan consists of a linear backbone of  beta(1,4)-linked xylose residues substituted with alpha(1,2)-linked glucuronic acid  (GlcA). Although several genes have been implicated in xylan synthesis through  mutant analyses, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for synthesizing xylan  are largely unknown. Here, we show evidence for biochemical activity of GUX1 (for  GlcA substitution of xylan 1), a member of Glycosyltransferase Family 8 in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that is responsible for adding the  glucuronosyl substitutions onto the xylan backbone. GUX1 has characteristics  typical of Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases and a K(m) for UDP-GlcA of 165  mum. GUX1 strongly favors xylohexaose as an acceptor over shorter  xylooligosaccharides, and with xylohexaose as an acceptor, GlcA is almost  exclusively added to the fifth xylose residue from the nonreducing end. We also  show that several related proteins, GUX2 to GUX5 and Plant Glycogenin-like Starch  Initiation Protein6, are Golgi localized and that only two of these proteins,  GUX2 and GUX4, have activity as xylan alpha-glucuronosyltransferases.', '2012 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.200964', 'Scheller']
