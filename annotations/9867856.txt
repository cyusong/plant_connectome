['9867856', 'In plants, Ser is synthesized through a couple of pathways. 3-Phosphoglycerate  dehydrogenase (PGDH), the first enzyme that is involved in the phosphorylated  pathway of Ser biosynthesis, is responsible for the oxidation of  3-phosphoglycerate to phosphohydroxypyruvate. Here we report the first molecular  cloning and characterization of PGDH from Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequence analysis  of cDNA and a genomic clone revealed that the PGDH gene is composed of three  exons, encoding a 623-amino acid polypeptide (66, 453 Da). The deduced protein,  containing three of the most conserved regions in the NAD-dependent 2-hydroxyacid  dehydrogenase family, has 38-39% identity to its animal and bacterial  counterparts. The presence of an N-terminal signal sequence for translocation  into plastids was confirmed by particle-gun bombardment experiments using green  fluorescence protein as a reporter protein for subcellular localization. Southern  hybridization analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping  indicated that PGDH is a single-copy gene that is mapped to the upper arm of  chromosome 1. Northern hybridization analysis indicated preferential expression  of PGDH mRNA in root tissues of light-grown plants, suggesting that the  phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis plays an important role in supplying  Ser to non-photosynthetic tissues. The recombinant enzyme overproduced in  Escherichia coli displayed hyperbolic kinetics with respect to 3-phosphoglycerate  and NAD+.', '1999 Jan 1', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.274.1.397', 'Saito']
