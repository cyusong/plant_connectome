Phototropins (phot1 and phot2), the blue light receptors in plants, regulate hypocotyl phototropism in a fluence-dependent manner. Especially under high fluence rates of blue light (HBL), the redundant function mediated by both phot1 and phot2 drastically restricts the understanding of the roles of phot2. Here, systematic analysis of phototropin-related mutants and overexpression transgenic lines revealed that HBL specifically induced a transient increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]cyt) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) hypocotyls and that the increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt was primarily attributed to phot2. Pharmacological and genetic experiments illustrated that HBL-induced Ca(2+) increases were modulated differently by phot1 and phot2. Phot2 mediated the HBL-induced increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt mainly by an inner store-dependent Ca(2+)-release pathway, not by activating plasma membrane Ca(2+) channels. Further analysis showed that the increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt was possibly responsible for HBL-induced hypocotyl phototropism. An inhibitor of auxin efflux carrier exhibited significant inhibitions of both phototropism and increases in [Ca(2+)]cyt, which indicates that polar auxin transport is possibly involved in HBL-induced responses. Moreover, PHYTOCHROME KINASE SUBSTRATE1 (PKS1), the phototropin-related signaling element identified, interacted physically with phototropins, auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED1 and calcium-binding protein CALMODULIN4, in vitro and in vivo, respectively, and HBL-induced phototropism was impaired in pks multiple mutants, indicating the role of the PKS family in HBL-induced phototropism. Together, these results provide new insights into the functions of phototropins and highlight a potential integration point through which Ca(2+) signaling-related HBL modulates hypocotyl phototropic responses.
