['36147700', 'The de-methylesterification of the pectic polysaccharide homogalacturonan (HG) by  pectin methylesterases (PMEs) is a critical step in the control of plant cell  expansion and morphogenesis. Plants have large gene families encoding PMEs but  also PME inhibitors (PMEIs) with differ in their biochemical properties. The  Arabidopsis thaliana PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR 3 (PMEI3) gene is frequently  used as a tool to manipulate pectin methylesterase activity in studies assessing  its role in the control of morphogenesis. One limitation of these studies is that  the exact biochemical activity of this protein has not yet been determined. In  this manuscript we produced the protein in Pichia pastoris and characterized its  activity in vitro. Like other PMEIs, PMEI3 inhibits PME activity at acidic pH in  a variety of cell wall extracts and in purified PME preparations, but does not  affect the much stronger PME activity at neutral pH. The protein is remarkable  heat stable and shows higher activity against PME3 than against PME2,  illustrating how different members of the large PMEI family can differ in their  specificities towards PME targets. Finally, growing Arabidopsis thaliana  seedlings in the presence of purified PMEI3 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of  root growth associated with the overall inhibition of HG de-methylesterification  of the root surface. This suggests an essential in vivo role for PME activity at  acidic pH in HG de-methylesterification and growth control. These results show  that purified recombinant PMEI3 is a powerful tool to study the connection  between pectin de-methylesterification and cell expansion.', '2022 Dec', 'Cell Surf', '10.1016/j.tcsw.2022.100080', 'Hofte']
