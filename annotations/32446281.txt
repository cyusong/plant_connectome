Fossil grass silica short cell phytoliths (GSSCP) have been used to reconstruct the biogeography of Poaceae, untangle crop domestication history and detect past vegetation shifts. These inferences depend on accurately identifying the clade to which the fossils belong. Patterns of GSSCP shape and size variation across the family have not been established and current classification methods are subjective or based on a 2D view that ignores important 3D shape variation. Focusing on Poaceae subfamilies Anomochlooideae, Pharoideae, Pueliodieae, Bambusoideae and Oryzoideae, we observed in situ GSSCP to establish their orientation and imaged isolated GSSCP using confocal microscopy to produce 3D models. 3D geometric morphometrics was used to analyze GSSCP shape and size. Classification models were applied to GSSCP from Eocene sediments from Nebraska, USA, and Anatolia, Turkey. There were significant shape differences between nearly all recognized GSSCP morphotypes and between clades with shared morphotypes. Most of the Eocene GSSCP were classified as woody bamboos with some distinctive Nebraska GSSCP classified as herbaceous bamboos. 3D morphometrics hold great promise for GSSCP classification. It accounts for the complete GSSCP shape, automates size measurements and accommodates the complete range of morphotypes within a single analytical framework.
