We review recent results about the functioning of aquatic carnivorous traps from the genus Utricularia. The use of high speed cameras has helped to elucidate the mechanism at the origin of the ultra fast capture process of Utricularia, at a millisecond time scale. As water is pumped out of the trap, pressure decreases inside the trap and elastic energy is stored due to the change of shape of the trap body. This energy is suddenly released when the trap is fired: the trap door undergoes an elastical instability--buckling--which allows its fast and passive opening and closure. This mechanism is used by Utricularia both to catch preys touching its trigger hairs and to fire spontaneously at regular time intervals. The results leading to this interpretation are reviewed and discussed and suggestions for further work are briefly presented.

Utricularia: !uses! Elastic Energy 
Elastic Energy: !allows! Trap Door Opening/Closing 
High Speed Cameras: !elucidate! Mechanism 
Water Pumping: !decreases! Pressure Inside Trap 
Trap Body: !stores! Elastic Energy 
Trigger Hairs: !catch! Preys 
Trap Door: !undergoes! Elastical Instability
