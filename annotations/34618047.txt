Most land plants live in close contact with beneficial soil microbes: the majority of land plant species establish symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while most legumes, the third largest plant family, can form a symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. These microbes contribute to plant nutrition via endosymbiotic processes that require modulating the expression and function of plant transporter systems. The efficient contribution of these symbionts involves precisely controlled integration of transport, which is enabled by the adaptability and plasticity of their transporters. Advances in our understanding of these systems, driven by functional genomics research, are rapidly filling the gap in knowledge about plant membrane transport involved in these plant-microbe interactions. In this review, we synthesize recent findings associated with different stages of these symbioses, from the pre-symbiotic stage to nutrient exchange, and describe the role of host transport systems in both mycorrhizal and legume-rhizobia symbioses.
