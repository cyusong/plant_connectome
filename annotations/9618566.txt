['9618566', 'Millions of people worldwide suffer from nutritional imbalances of essential  metals like zinc. These same metals, along with pollutants like cadmium and lead,  contaminate soils at many sites around the world. In addition to posing a threat  to human health, these metals can poison plants, livestock, and wildlife.  Deciphering how metals are absorbed, transported, and incorporated as protein  cofactors may help solve both of these problems. For example, edible plants could  be engineered to serve as better dietary sources of metal nutrients, and other  plant species could be tailored to remove metal ions from contaminated soils. We  report here the cloning of the first zinc transporter genes from plants, the  ZIP1, ZIP2, and ZIP3 genes of Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression in yeast of these  closely related genes confers zinc uptake activities. In the plant, ZIP1 and ZIP3  are expressed in roots in response to zinc deficiency, suggesting that they  transport zinc from the soil into the plant. Although expression of ZIP2 has not  been detected, a fourth related Arabidopsis gene identified by genome sequencing,  ZIP4, is induced in both shoots and roots of zinc-limited plants. Thus, ZIP4 may  transport zinc intracellularly or between plant tissues. These ZIP proteins  define a family of metal ion transporters that are found in plants, protozoa,  fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates, making it now possible to address  questions of metal ion accumulation and homeostasis in diverse organisms.', '1998 Jun 9', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.95.12.7220', 'Eide']
