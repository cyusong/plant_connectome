The surface properties of the plant cuticle play a crucial role in plant-pathogen interactions and the retention and penetration of agriculturally important chemicals. This paper describes the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine surface-specific chemical and material properties of the adaxial surface of Prunus laurocerasus L. leaves. XPS data, derived from the uppermost few nanometres (< 10 nm) of the leaf surface, were consistent with the wax components and functionality known to be present within the waxes. ToF-SIMS provided molecular speciation from the outermost monolayer of the leaf surface, indicating the importance of a family of acetates with chain lengths ranging from C20 to C34. The presence of alkanes with C29 and C31 chain lengths was also confirmed. SEM and TM-AFM topography images revealed a textured granular surface, while simultaneously recorded AFM phase images revealed heterogeneous material properties at the nanoscale. The relevance of these data to plant cuticle development, allelochemistry and agrochemical delivery is discussed.
