Peroxisomes perform a range of different functions, dependent upon organism, tissue type, developmental stage or environmental conditions, many of which are connected with lipid metabolism. This review summarises recent research on ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters of the peroxisomal membrane (ABC subfamily D) and their roles in plants, fungi and animals. Analysis of mutants has revealed that peroxisomal ABC transporters play key roles in specific metabolic and developmental functions in different organisms. A common function is import of substrates for beta-oxidation but much remains to be determined concerning transport substrates and mechanisms which appear to differ significantly between phyla.
