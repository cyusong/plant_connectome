Status of the current outbreak of cassava mosaic disease (CMD) in Southeast Asia was reviewed. Healthy cassava seed production and dissemination systems have been established in Vietnam and Cambodia, along with integrated disease and pest management systems, to combat the outbreak. Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is one of the most important edible crops in tropical and subtropical regions. Recently, invasive insect pests and diseases have resulted in serious losses to cassava in Southeast Asia. In this review we discuss the current outbreak of cassava mosaic disease (CMD) caused by the Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus (SLCMV) in Southeast Asia, and summarize similarities between SLCMV and other cassava mosaic begomoviruses. A SATREPS (Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development) project "Development and dissemination of sustainable production systems based on invasive pest management of cassava in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand", was launched in 2016, which has been funded by The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and The Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Japan. The objectives of SATREPS were to establish healthy seed production and dissemination systems for cassava in south Vietnam and Cambodia, and to develop management systems for plant diseases and insect pests of cassava. To achieve these goals, model systems of healthy seed production in Vietnam and Cambodia have been developed incorporating CMD-resistant planting materials through international networks with The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA).
