Group II introns are common in the mitochondrial genome of higher plant species. The splicing of these introns is a complex process involving the synergistic action of multiple factors. However, few of these factors have been characterized in maize. In this study, we found that the Empty pericarp11 (Emp11) gene, which encodes a P-type pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, is required for the development of maize seeds. The loss of Emp11 function seriously impairs embryo and endosperm development, resulting in empty pericarp seeds in maize, and alteration in Emp11 expression leads to quantitative variation in kernel size and weight. We found that the emp11 mutants showed a failure in nad1 intron splicing, exhibited a severe reduction in complex I assembly and activity, mitochondrial structure disturbances, and an increase in alternative oxidase AOX2 and AOX3 levels. Interestingly, the emp11 phenotype was very severe in the W22 inbred line but could be partially recovered in B73 BC2F2 segregating ears. These results suggest that EMP11 serves as a factor for the splicing of mitochondrial nad1 introns and is required for mitochondrial function to ensure proper seed development in maize.
