Insect-derived volatiles seem to provide reliable chemical cues that plants could employ to defend themselves. Here we investigated the effect of pheromone emission from a closely associated (Anthonomus grandis; boll weevil) and an unassociated (Tibraca limbativentris) herbivore on cotton volatile emission. Exposure to A. grandis aggregation pheromone induced cotton defence response by enhancing the emission of volatiles attractive to the natural enemy of A. grandis, the parasitic wasp Bracon vulgaris, but only when the pheromonal blend was complete (all four components). Individual components of A. grandis aggregation pheromone were not able to induce cotton plants to increase the release of volatiles. On the other hand, T. limbativentris sex pheromone did not induce any change in the cotton constitutive volatile profile. Our results support the hypothesis that plants are able to detect pheromones of tightly co-evolved herbivores. Moreover, A. grandis pheromone exposure induced similar volatile compounds to herbivore-induced cotton, such as linalool, (E)-ocimene, (E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT), and (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT). We also showed that the larval ectoparasitoid B. vulgaris relies on boll weevil's aggregation pheromone and pheromone-induced plant volatiles as kairomones to locate suitable hosts.
