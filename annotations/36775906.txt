Maize is a major crop essential for food and feed, but its production is threatened by various biotic and abiotic stresses. Drought is one of the most common abiotic stresses, causing severe crop yield reduction. Although several studies have been devoted to selecting drought-tolerant maize lines and detecting the drought-responsive mechanism of maize, the transcriptomic differences between drought-tolerant and drought-susceptible maize lines are still largely unknown. In our study, RNA-seq was performed on leaves of the drought-tolerant line W9706 and the drought-susceptible line B73 after drought treatment. We identified 3147 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these two lines. The up-regulated DEGs in W9706 were enriched in specific processes, including ABA signaling, wax biosynthesis, CHO metabolism, signal transduction and brassinosteroid biosynthesis-related processes, while the downregulated DEGs were enriched in specific processes, such as stomatal movement. Altogether, transcriptomic analysis suggests that the different drought resistances were correlated with the differential expression of genes, while the drought tolerance of W9706 is due to the more rapid response to stimulus, higher water retention capacity and stable cellular environment under water deficit conditions.
