Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) perceives blue/UV-A light and regulates photomorphogenesis in plants. However, besides Arabidopsis, CRY2 has been functionally characterized only in native species of japonica rice and tomato. In the present study, the BnCRY2a, generating a relatively longer cDNA and harboring an intron in its 5'UTR, has been characterized in detail. Western blot analysis revealed that BnCRY2a is light labile and degraded rapidly by 26S proteasome when seedlings are irradiated with blue light. For functional analysis, BnCRY2a was over-expressed in Brassica juncea, a related species more amenable to transformation. The BnCRY2a over-expression (BnCRY2a<sup>OE</sup>) transgenics developed short hypocotyl and expanded cotyledons, accumulated more anthocyanin in light-grown seedlings, and displayed early flowering on maturity. Early flowering in BnCRY2a<sup>OE</sup> transgenics was coupled with the up-regulation of many flowering-related genes such as FT. The present study also highlights the differential light sensitivity of cry1 and cry2 in controlling hypocotyl elongation growth in Brassica. BnCRY2a<sup>OE</sup> seedlings developed much shorter hypocotyl under the low-intensity of blue light, while BnCRY1<sup>OE</sup> seedling hypocotyls were shorter under the high-intensity blue light, compared to untransformed seedlings.
