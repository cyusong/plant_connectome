['22345506', "5'-Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is the common by-product of polyamine (PA),  nicotianamine (NA), and ethylene biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana). The methylthiol moiety of MTA is salvaged by 5'-methylthioadenosine  nucleosidase (MTN) in a reaction producing methylthioribose (MTR) and adenine.  The MTN double mutant, mtn1-1mtn2-1, retains approximately 14% of the MTN enzyme  activity present in the wild type and displays a pleiotropic phenotype that  includes altered vasculature and impaired fertility. These abnormal traits were  associated with increased MTA levels, altered PA profiles, and reduced NA  content. Exogenous feeding of PAs partially recovered fertility, whereas NA  supplementation improved fertility and also reversed interveinal chlorosis. The  analysis of PA synthase crystal structures containing bound MTA suggests that the  corresponding enzyme activities are sensitive to available MTA. Mutant plants  that expressed either MTN or human methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (which  metabolizes MTA without producing MTR) appeared wild type, proving that the  abnormal traits of the mutant are due to MTA accumulation rather than reduced  MTR. Based on our results, we propose that the key targets affected by increased  MTA content are thermospermine synthase activity and spermidine-dependent  posttranslational modification of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A.", '2012 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.191072', 'Moffatt']
