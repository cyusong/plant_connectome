In eukaryotes, dynamins and dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) are high-molecular weight GTPases responsible for mechanochemical fission of organelles or membranes. Of the six DRP subfamilies in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, AtDRP1 and AtDRP2 family members serve as endocytic accessory proteins in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Most studies have focused on AtDRP1A and AtDRP2B as critical modulators of plant pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) against pathogenic, flagellated <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 bacteria and immune signaling in response to the bacterial flagellin peptide flg22. Much less is known about AtDRP2A, the closely related paralog of AtDRP2B. AtDRP2A and AtDRP2B are the only classical, or <i>bona fide</i>, dynamins in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, based on their evolutionary conserved domain structure with mammalian dynamins functioning in endocytosis. AtDRP2B but not AtDRP2A is required for robust ligand-induced endocytosis of the receptor kinase FLAGELLIN SENSING2 for dampening of early flg22 signaling. Here, we utilized <i>Arabidopsis drp2a</i> null mutants to identify AtDRP2A as a positive contributor to effective PTI against <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 bacteria, consistent with reduced <i>PATHOGEN RELATED1</i> (<i>PR1</i>) messenger RNA accumulation. We provide evidence that AtDRP2A is a novel modulator of late flg22 signaling, contributing positively to <i>PR1</i> gene induction but negatively to polyglucan callose deposition. AtDRP2A has no apparent roles in flg22-elicited mitogen-activated protein kinase defense marker gene induction. In summary, this study adds the evolutionary conserved dynamin AtDRP2A to a small group of vesicular trafficking proteins with roles as non-canonical contributors in immune responses, likely due to modulating one or both the localization and activity of multiple different proteins with distinct contributions to immune signaling.
