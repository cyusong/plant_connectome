We previously reported that the BTB (brica-brac, tramtrack, and broad) domain-containing protein Clt1 regulates melanin and toxin synthesis, conidiation, and pathogenicity in <i>Curvularia lunata</i>, but the interacting proteins and regulative mechanism of Clt1 are unclear. In this research, we identified two proteins, which respectively correspond to xylanase (Clxyn24) and acetyl xylan esterase (Claxe43) from <i>C. lunata</i>, that were regulated by Clt1. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays were conducted to verify the interaction of Clt1 with full-length Clxyn24 and Claxe43. Furthermore, the Y2H assay revealed that Clt1 physically interacted with Clxyn24 and Claxe43 through its BTB domain to degrade xylan, which was used as a carbon source for <i>C. lunata</i> growth. The utilization of xylan provides acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of melanin and toxin as well as energy and other intermediate metabolites for conidiation. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that <i>PKS18</i> and its 13 flanking genes found clustered in a region spanning 57.89 kb on scaffold 9 of the <i>C. lunata</i> CX-3 genome were down-regulated in toxin production-deficient mutant T806, and this cluster is possibly responsible for toxin biosynthesis of <i>C. lunata</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
