RNA editing in plants, animals, and humans modifies genomically encoded cytidine or adenosine nucleotides to uridine or inosine, respectively, in mRNAs. We customized the MassARRAY System (Sequenom Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, www.sequenom.com) to assay multiplex PCR-amplified single-stranded cDNAs and easily analyse and display the captured data. By using appropriate oligonucleotide probes, the method can be tailored to any organism and gene where RNA editing occurs. Editing extent of up to 40 different nucleotides in each of either 94 or 382 different samples (3760 or 15 280 editing targets, respectively) can be examined by assaying a single plate and by performing one repetition. We have established this mass spectrometric method as a dependable, cost-effective and time-saving technique to examine the RNA editing efficiency at 37 Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplast editing sites at a high level of multiplexing. The high-throughput editing assay, named Multiplex RT-PCR Mass Spectrometry (MRMS), is ideal for large-scale experiments such as identifying population variation, examining tissue-specific changes in editing extent, or screening a mutant or transgenic collection. Moreover, the required amount of starting material is so low that RNA from fewer than 50 cells can be examined without amplification. We demonstrate the use of the method to identify natural variation in editing extent of chloroplast C targets in a collection of Arabidopsis accessions.
