<i>slPHB3</i> was cloned from <i>Salix linearistipularis</i>, the amino acid sequence blast and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that slPHB3 has the most similarity with PHB3 from <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> using DNAMAN software and MEGA7 software. RT-qPCR results confirmed that the expression of <i>slPHB3</i> was induced obviously under stress treatments. The growth of recombinant yeast cells was better than that of the control group under the stress treatment, indicating that <i>slPHB3</i> may be involved in the stress response of yeast cells. The transgenic tobacco was treated with different concentrations of NaCl, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, fresh weigh of overexpression tobacco were heavier than wild-types. The results showed that transgenic tobacco was more tolerant to salt and oxidation than wild-type tobacco. Expression of important genes including <i>NHX1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> in salt stress response pathways are steadily higher in overexpression tobacco than that in wild-types. We identified 17 proteins interacting with slPHB3 by yeast two-hybrid technique, most of these proteins were relation to the stresses. The salt tolerance of <i>slPHB3</i> expressing yeast and <i>slPHB3</i> overexpressing plants were better than that of the control. Ten stress-related proteins may interact with slPHB3, which preliminarily indicated that <i>slPHB3</i> had a certain response relationship with salt stress. The study of <i>slPHB3</i> under abiotic stress can improve our understanding of <i>PHB3</i> gene function.
