Moderate stimuli in mitochondria improve wide-ranging stress adaptability in animals, but whether mitochondria play similar roles in plants is largely unknown. Here, we report the enhanced stress adaptability of S-type cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS-S) maize and its association with mild expression of sterilizing gene ORF355. A CMS-S maize line exhibited superior growth potential and higher yield than those of the near-isogenic N-type line in saline fields. Moderate expression of ORF355 induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and activated the cellular antioxidative defense system. This adaptive response was mediated by elevation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide concentration and associated metabolic homeostasis. Metabolome analysis revealed broad metabolic changes in CMS-S lines, even in the absence of salinity stress. Metabolic products associated with amino acid metabolism and galactose metabolism were substantially changed, which underpinned the alteration of the antioxidative defense system in CMS-S plants. The results reveal the ORF355-mediated superior stress adaptability in CMS-S maize and might provide an important route to developing salt-tolerant maize varieties.
