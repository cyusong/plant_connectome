DIVARICATA AND RADIALIS INTERACTING FACTOR (DRIF) from snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) is a MYB/SANT protein that interacts with related MYB/SANT proteins, RADIALIS and DIVARICATA, through its N-terminal MYB/SANT domain. In addition to the MYB/SANT domain, DRIF contains a C-terminal domain of unknown function (DUF3755). Here we describe novel protein-protein interactions involving a poplar (Populus trichocarpa) homolog of DRIF, PtrDRIF1. In addition to interacting with poplar homologs of RADIALIS (PtrRAD1) and DIVARICATA (PtrDIV4), PtrDRIF1 interacted with members of other families within the homeodomain-like superfamily, including PtrWOX13c, a WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX protein, and PtrKNAT7, a KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX protein. PtrRAD1 and PtrDIV4 interacted with the MYB/SANT-containing N-terminal portion of PtrDRIF1, whereas DUF3755 was both necessary and sufficient for interactions with PtrWOX13c and PtrKNAT7. Of the two MYB/SANT domains present in PtrDIV4, only the N-terminal MYB/SANT domain interacted with PtrDRIF1. GFP-PtrDRIF1 expressed alone or with PtrRAD1 localized to the cytoplasm, whereas co-expression of GFP-PtrDRIF1 with PtrDIV4, PtrWOX13c or PtrKNAT7 resulted in nuclear localization of GFP-PtrDRIF1. Modified yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments using PtrDRIF1 as a bridge protein revealed that PtrDRIF1 simultaneously interacted with PtrRAD1 and PtrWOX13c, but could not form a heterotrimeric complex when PtrDIV4 was substituted for PtrRAD1. Moreover, a Y2H competition assay indicated that PtrKNAT7 inhibits the interaction between PtrRAD1 and PtrDRIF1. The discovery of an additional protein-protein interaction domain in DRIF proteins, DUF3755, and its ability to form heterodimers and heterotrimers involving MYB/SANT and wood-associated homeodomain proteins, implicates DRIF proteins as mediators of a broader array of processes than previously reported.
