Post-translational regulations of Shaker-like voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels were reported to be essential for rapid responses to environmental stresses in plants. In particular, it has been shown that calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) regulate Shaker channels in plants. Here, the focus was on KAT2, a Shaker channel cloned in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, where is it expressed namely in the vascular tissues of leaves. After co-expression of KAT2 with AtCPK6 in <i>Xenopus</i><i>laevis</i> oocytes, voltage-clamp recordings demonstrated that AtCPK6 stimulates the activity of KAT2 in a calcium-dependent manner. A physical interaction between these two proteins has also been shown by Förster resonance energy transfer by fluorescence lifetime imaging (FRET-FLIM). Peptide array assays support that AtCPK6 phosphorylates KAT2 at several positions, also in a calcium-dependent manner. Finally, K<sup>+</sup> fluorescence imaging <i>in planta</i> suggests that K<sup>+</sup> distribution is impaired in <i>kat2</i> knock-out mutant leaves. We propose that the AtCPK6/KAT2 couple plays a role in the homeostasis of K<sup>+</sup> distribution in leaves.
