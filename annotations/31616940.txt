Soluble carbohydrates not only directly affect plant growth and development but also act as signal molecules in processes that enhance tolerance to cold stress. Raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) are an example and play an important role in abiotic stress tolerance. This study aimed to determine whether galactinol, a key limiting factor in RFO biosynthesis, functions as a signal molecule in triggering cold tolerance. Exposure to low temperatures induces the expression of galactinol synthase (AnGolS1) in Ammopiptanthus nanus, a desert plant that survives temperatures between -30 °C to 47 °C. AnGolS1 has a greater catalytic activity than tomato galactinol synthase (SlGolS2). Moreover, SlGolS2 is expressed only at low levels. Expression of AnGolS1 in tomato enhanced cold tolerance and led to changes in the sugar composition of the seeds and seedlings. AnGolS1 transgenic tomato lines exhibited an enhanced capacity for ethylene (ET) signaling. The application of galactinol abolished the repression of the ET signaling pathway by 1-methylcyclopropene during seed germination. In addition, the expression of ERF transcription factors was increased. Galactinol may therefore act as a signal molecule affecting the ET pathway.
