Seagrasses are the only submerged marine higher plants, which can colonize the sea through sexual (<i>via</i> seeds) reproduction. The transition between seed dormancy and germination is an important ecological trait and a key stage in the life cycle of higher plants. According to our observations, the seeds of <i>Zostera marina</i> L. (eelgrass) in Swan Lake (SL) and Qingdao Bay (QB) in northern China have the same maturation time (summer) but different germination time. To investigate this phenomenon, we further carried out reciprocal transplantation experiment and transcriptome analysis. Results revealed that differences in the seed germination time between the two sites do exist and are determined by internal molecular mechanisms as opposed to environmental factors. Furthermore, we conducted comparative transcriptome analysis of seeds at the mature and early germination stages in both locations. The results that the number of genes related to energy, hormone and cell changes was higher in SL than in QB, could account for that the dormancy depth of seeds in SL was deeper than that in QB; consequently, the seeds in SL needed to mobilize more related genes to break dormancy and start germination. The results could have important practical implications for seagrass meadow restoration <i>via</i> seeds and provide in-depth and comprehensive data for understanding the molecular mechanisms related to seagrass seed germination.
