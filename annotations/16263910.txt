['16263910', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana ascorbate-deficient vtc-1 mutant has only 30% ascorbate  contents of the wild type (WT). This ascorbate-deficient mutant was used here to  study the physiological roles of ascorbate under salt stress in vivo. Salt stress  resulted in a more significant decrease in CO2 assimilatory capacity in the vtc-1  mutant than in the WT. Photosystem II function in the Arabidopsis vtc-1 mutant  also showed an increased sensitivity to salt stress. Oxidative stress, indicated  by the hydrogen peroxide content, increased more dramatically in the vtc-1 mutant  than in the WT under salt stress. To clarify the reason for the increased  oxidative stress in the vtc-1 mutant, the contents of small antioxidant compounds  and the activities of several antioxidant enzymes in the ascorbate-glutathione  cycle were measured. Despite an elevated glutathione pool in the vtc-1 mutant,  the ascorbate contents and the reduced form of ascorbate decreased very rapidly  under salt stress. These results showed that the activities of MDAR and DHAR were  lower in the vtc-1 mutant than in the WT under salt stress. Thus, low intrinsic  ascorbate and an impaired ascorbate-glutathione cycle in the vtc-1 mutant under  salt stress probably induced a dramatic decrease in the reduced form of  ascorbate, which resulted in both enhanced ROS contents and decreased NPQ in the  vtc-1 mutant.', '2005 Dec', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eri301', 'Zhang']
