Starch degradation is a necessary process determining banana fruit quality during ripening. Many starch degradation-related genes are well studied. However, the transcriptional regulation of starch degradation during banana fruit ripening remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified a MYB transcription factor (TF) termed MaMYB3, as a putative protein binding the promoter of MaGWD1, a member of glucan water dikinase (GWD) family which has been demonstrated as an important enzyme of starch degradation. MaMYB3 was ripening- and ethylene-repressible, and its expression was negatively correlated with starch degradation. Acting as a nucleus-localized transcriptional repressor, MaMYB3 repressed the transcription of 10 starch degradation-related genes, including MaGWD1, MaSEX4, MaBAM7-MaBAM8, MaAMY2B, MaAMY3, MaAMY3A, MaAMY3C, MaMEX1, and MapGlcT2-1, by directly binding to their promoters. Interestingly, a previously identified activator of starch degradation-related genes, MabHLH6, was also suppressed by MaMYB3. The ectopic overexpression of MaMYB3 in tomato down-regulated the expression of starch degradation-related genes, inhibited starch degradation and delayed fruit ripening. Based on these findings, we conclude that MaMYB3 negatively impacts starch degradation by directly repressing starch degradation-related genes and MabHLH6, and thereby delays banana fruit ripening. Collectively, our study expands our understanding of the complex transcriptional regulatory hierarchy modulating starch degradation during fruit ripening.
