<i>Thinopyrum ponticum</i> (2<i>n</i> = 10<i>x</i> = 70) is a wild relative of wheat with high tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses; it has been wildly used in wheat genetic improvement. A disomic substitution line named SN19647 was derived from a cross between <i>Triticum aestivum</i> and the wheat-<i>Th. ponticum</i> partial amphiploid SNTE20 (2<i>n</i> = 8<i>x</i> = 56). It was evaluated for disease resistance and characterized <i>via</i> sequential fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH)-genomic <i>in situ</i> hybridization (GISH) and molecular markers. The results showed that SN19647 carried resistance to both powdery mildew and leaf rust. It contained 42 chromosomes with a pair of wheat chromosome 1B replaced by a pair of J<sup>S</sup> chromosomes from <i>Th. ponticum</i>. In addition to chromosomal substitution events, structural variation also occurred on wheat chromosomes 2A, 5A, 6B, and 7B. Based on marker analysis, 19 markers specific to the J<sup>S</sup> chromosome were obtained, of which seventeen markers belonged to homoeologous group one. These results indicated that SN19647 was a 1J<sup>S</sup> (1B) substitution line. Compared with the known 1J<sup>S</sup> (1D) substitution line CH10A5, it was found that 17 markers generated different specific bands to <i>Th. ponticum</i>, confirming the novelty of the 1J<sup>S</sup> chromosome in SN19647. Therefore, SN19647, resistant to powdery mildew and leaf rust, was a novel 1J<sup>S</sup> (1B) substitution line that can be used in wheat genetic improvement.
