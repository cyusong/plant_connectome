Drought stress adversely affects plant growth, development, and productivity. Genes functioning in plant response to drought stress are essential for drought tolerance. In this study, SlCOR413IM1, a cold-regulated gene isolated from Solanum lycopersium, was transferred to Nicotiana tabacum to investigate its function under drought stress. The subcellular localisation of SlCOR413IM1-GFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis protoplasts suggested that SlCOR413IM1 is a chloroplast protein. Expression analyses revealed that SlCOR413IM1 responded to drought and cold stresses. Under drought stress, transgenic plants maintained the high maximum photochemical efficiency, net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and D1 protein content of photosystem II (PSII). Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, transgenic plants showed higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities and proline and soluble sugar content, which reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, the high SOD and APX activities in transgenic plants were independent of their transcription levels. Moreover, the transgenic plants exhibited better seed germination, water status and survival, as well as lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content and relative electrical conductivity (REC) than WT plants under drought stress. Taken together, these data demonstrated that overexpression of SlCOR413IM1 enhanced drought stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco.
