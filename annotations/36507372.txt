Maturases can specifically bind to intron-containing pre-RNAs, folding them into catalytic structures that facilitate intron splicing <i>in vivo</i>. Plants possess four nuclear-encoded maturase-related factors (nMAT1-nMAT4) and some maturases have been shown to involve in the splicing of different mitochondrial group II introns; however, the specific biological functions of maturases in maize are largely uncharacterized. In this study, we identified a maize <i>ZmnMAT1</i> gene, which encodes a mitochondrion-localized type I maturase with an RT domain at N-terminus and an X domain at C-terminus. Loss-of-function mutation in <i>ZmnMAT1</i> significantly reduced the splicing efficiencies of <i>Nad1</i> intron 1 and <i>Nad4</i> intron 2, and showed arrested embryogenesis and endosperm development, which may be related to impaired mitochondrial ultrastructure and function due to the destruction of the assembly and activity of complex I. Direct physical interaction was undetectable between ZmnMAT1 and the proteins associated with the splicing of <i>Nad1</i> intron 1 and/or <i>Nad4</i> intron 2 by yeast two-hybrid assays, suggesting the complexity of group II intron splicing in plants.
