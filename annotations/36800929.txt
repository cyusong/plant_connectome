The gibberellic acid-stimulated Arabidopsis (GASA) gene encodes a class of cysteine-rich functional proteins and is ubiquitous in plants. Most GASA proteins are influence the signal transmission of plant hormones and regulate plant growth and development, however, their function in Jatropha curcas is still unknown. In this study, we cloned JcGASA6, a member of the GASA family, from J. curcas. The JcGASA6 protein has a GASA-conserved domain and is located in the tonoplast. The three-dimensional structure of the JcGASA6 protein is highly consistent with the antibacterial protein Snakin-1. Additionally, the results of the yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay showed that JcGASA6 was activated by JcERF1, JcPYL9, and JcFLX. The results of the Y2H assay showed that both JcCNR8 and JcSIZ1 could interact with JcGASA6 in the nucleus. The expression of JcGASA6 increased continuously during male flower development, and the overexpression of JcGASA6 was associated with filament elongation of the stamens in tobacco. JcGASA6, a member of the GASA family in J. curcas, play an important role in growth regulation and floral development (especially in male flower). It is also involved in the signal transduction of hormones, such as ABA, ET, GA, BR, and SA. Also, JcGASA6 is a potential antimicrobial protein determined by its three-dimensional structure.
