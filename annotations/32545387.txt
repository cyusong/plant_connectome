Cellular aquaporin water channels (AQPs) constitute a large family of transmembrane proteins present throughout all kingdoms of life, playing important roles in the uptake of water and many solutes across the membranes. In olive trees, AQP diversity, protein features and their biological functions are still largely unknown. This study focuses on the structure and functional and evolution diversity of AQP subfamilies in two olive trees, the wild species <i>Olea europaea</i> var. <i>sylvestris</i> (<i>Oeu</i>AQPs) and the domesticated species <i>Olea europaea</i> cv. Picual (<i>Oleur</i>AQPs), and describes their involvement in different physiological processes of early plantlet development and in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in the domesticated species. A scan of genomes from the wild and domesticated olive species revealed the presence of 52 and 79 genes encoding full-length AQP sequences, respectively. Cross-genera phylogenetic analysis with orthologous clustered <i>Olea</i>AQPs into five established subfamilies: PIP, TIP, NIP, SIP, and XIP. Subsequently, gene structures, protein motifs, substrate specificities and cellular localizations of the full length <i>Olea</i>AQPs were predicted. Functional prediction based on the NPA motif, ar/R selectivity filter, Froger's and specificity-determining positions suggested differences in substrate specificities of Olea AQPs. Expression analysis of the <i>Oleur</i>AQP genes indicates that some genes are tissue-specific, whereas few others show differential expressions at different developmental stages and in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses. The current study presents the first detailed genome-wide analysis of the AQP gene family in olive trees and it provides valuable information for further functional analysis to infer the role of AQP in the adaptation of olive trees in diverse environmental conditions in order to help the genetic improvement of domesticated olive trees.
