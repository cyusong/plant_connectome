In this paper, an interaction model of apomixis-related genes was constructed to analyze the emergence of apomictic types. It is speculated that apomixis technology will be first implemented in gramineous plants. Apomixis (asexual seed formation) is a phenomenon in which a plant bypasses the most fundamental aspects of sexual reproduction-meiosis and fertilization-to form a viable seed. Plants can form seeds without fertilization, and the seed genotype is consistent with the female parent. The development of apomictic technology would be revolutionary for agriculture and for food production as it would reduce costs and breeding times and also avoid many complications typical of sexual reproduction (e.g. incompatibility barriers) and of vegetative propagation (e.g. viral transfer). The application of apomictic reproductive technology has the potential to revolutionize crop breeding. This article reviews recent advances in apomixis in cytology and molecular biology. The general idea of identifying apomixis was proposed and the process of the emergence of non-fusion types was discussed. To better understand the apomixis mechanism, an apomixis regulatory model was established. At the same time, the realization of apomixis technology is proposed, which provides reference for the research and application of apomixis.
