Resistance of grapevine to Plasmopara viticola is associated with the hypersensitive reaction, accumulation of stilbenoids, and formation of callose depositions. Spectral characterization of infected leaf tissue of cvs 'Regent' and 'Solaris' with resistance genes Rpv 3-1 and Rpv 10 and Rpv 3-3, respectively, suggested that resistance is not dependent on large-scale necrotization of host tissue. Reactions of the resistant cultivars and a reference susceptible to P. viticola were studied using hyperspectral imaging (range 400-1000 nm) at the tissue level and microscopic techniques. Resistance of both cultivars was incomplete and allowed pathogen reproduction. Spectral vegetation indices characterized the host response to pathogen invasion; the vitality of infected and necrotic leaf tissue differed significantly. Resistance depended on local accumulation of polyphenols in response to haustorium formation and was more effective for cv. 'Solaris'. Although hypersensitive reaction of some cells prevented colonization of palisade parenchyma, resistance was not associated with extensive necrotization of tissue, and the biotrophic pathogen survived localized death of penetrated host cells. Hyperspectral imaging was suitable to characterize and differentiate the resistance reactions of grapevine cultivars by mapping of the cellular response to pathogen attack on the tissue level and yields useful information on host-pathogen interactions.
