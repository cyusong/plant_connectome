Vegetative propagation is an important method of reproduction and rejuvenation in horticulture and forestry plants with a long lifespan. Although substantial juvenile clones have been obtained through the vegetative propagation of ornamental plants, the molecular factors that regulate rejuvenation during vegetative propagation are largely unknown. Here, root sprouting and root cutting of Robinia pseudoacacia were used as two vegetative propagation methods. From two consecutive years of transcriptome data from rejuvenated seedlings and mature trees, one gene module and one miRNA module were found to be specifically associated with rejuvenation during vegetative propagation through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). In the gene module, a transcription factor-encoding gene showed high expression during vegetative propagation, and it was subsequently named RpTOE1 through homology analysis. Heterologous overexpression of RpTOE1 in wild-type Arabidopsis and toe1 toe2 double mutants prolonged the juvenile phase. The qRT-PCR results predicted RpFT to be a downstream gene that was regulated by RpTOE1. Further investigation of the protein-DNA interactions using yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift, and dual luciferase reporter assays confirmed that RpTOE1 negatively regulated RpFT by binding directly to the TOE binding site (TBS)-like motif on its promoter. On the basis of these results, we showed that the high expression of RpTOE1 during vegetative propagation and its inhibition of RpFT played a key role in the phase reversal of R. pseudoacacia.
