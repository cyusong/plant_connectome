Ricklefs and Renner (Reports, 27 January 2012, p. 464) have argued that the neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography cannot explain the correlations in family abundances and species richness found between tropical forests from distinct continents. However, we show that such patterns can arise from neutral processes of diversification, migration, and drift over large spatial and temporal scales.
