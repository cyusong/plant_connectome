Vascular plant one-zinc-finger (VOZ) transcription factor, a plant specific one-zinc-finger-type transcriptional activator, is involved in regulating numerous biological processes such as floral induction and development, defense against pathogens, and response to multiple types of abiotic stress. Six VOZ transcription factor-encoding genes (<i>GmVOZs</i>) have been reported to exist in the soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) genome. In spite of this, little information is currently available regarding <i>GmVOZs.</i> In this study, <i>GmVOZs</i> were cloned and characterized. <i>GmVOZ</i> genes encode proteins possessing transcriptional activation activity in yeast cells. <i>GmVOZ1E</i>, <i>GmVOZ2B</i>, and <i>GmVOZ2D</i> gene products were widely dispersed in the cytosol, while GmVOZ1G was primarily located in the nucleus. <i>GmVOZs</i> displayed a differential expression profile under dehydration, salt, and salicylic acid (SA) stress conditions. Among them, <i>GmVOZ1G</i> showed a significantly induced expression in response to all stress treatments. Overexpression of <i>GmVOZ1G</i> in soybean hairy roots resulted in a greater tolerance to drought and salt stress. In contrast, RNA interference (RNAi) soybean hairy roots suppressing <i>GmVOZ1G</i> were more sensitive to both of these stresses. Under drought treatment, soybean composite plants with an overexpression of hairy roots had higher relative water content (RWC). In response to drought and salt stress, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation and higher peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were observed in soybean composite seedlings with an overexpression of hairy roots. The opposite results for each physiological parameter were obtained in RNAi lines. In conclusion, <i>GmVOZ1G</i> positively regulates drought and salt stress tolerance in soybean hairy roots. Our results will be valuable for the functional characterization of soybean VOZ transcription factors under abiotic stress.
