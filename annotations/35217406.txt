Phloem plays a central role in assimilate transport as well as in the transport of several secondary compounds. In order to study the chemical composition of phloem sap, different methods have been used for its collection, including stem incisions, EDTA-facilitated exudation or aphid stylectomy. Each collection method has several advantages and disadvantages and, unfortunately, the reported metabolite profiles and concentrations depend on the method used for exudate collection. This review therefore primarily focusses on sugars, amino acids, inorganic ions and further transported compounds like organic acids, nucleotides, phytohormons, defense signals, and lipophilic substances in the phloem sap obtained by aphid stylectomy to facilitate comparability of the data.
