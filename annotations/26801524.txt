['26801524', 'Triterpenoids have diverse chemical structures and bioactivities. Cytochrome P450  monooxygenases play a key role in their structural diversification. In higher  plants, CYP716A subfamily enzymes are triterpene oxidases. In this study,  Arabidopsis thaliana CYP716A1 and CYP716A2 were characterized by heterologously  expressing them in simple triterpene-producing yeast strains. In contrast to the  C-28 oxidative activity of CYP716A1 shown in several CYP716A subfamily enzymes,  remarkably, CYP716A2 displayed 22alpha-hydroxylation activity against alpha-amyrin that  has not been previously reported, which produces the cytotoxic triterpenoid,  22alpha-hydroxy-alpha-amyrin. Our results contribute to the enrichment of the molecular  toolbox that allows for the combinatorial biosynthesis of diverse triterpenoids.', '2016 Feb', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1002/1873-3468.12074', 'Muranaka']
