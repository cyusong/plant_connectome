The kinetics of response to strong light have been examined in deeply shaded leaves of the tropical tree legume (Inga sp.) which have extraordinarily high levels of the alpha-xanthophyll lutein-epoxide that are co-located in pigment-protein complexes of the photosynthetic apparatus with the beta-xanthophyll violaxanthin. As in other species, rapidly reversible photoprotection (measured as non-photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching) is initiated within the time frame of sun-flecks (minutes), before detectable conversion of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin or zeaxanthin. Photoprotection is stabilized within hours of exposure to strong light by simultaneously engaging the reversible violaxanthin cycle and a slowly reversible conversion of lutein-epoxide to lutein. It is proposed that this lutein 'locks in' a primary mechanism of photoprotection during photoacclimation in this species, converting efficient light-harvesting antennae of the shade plant into potential excitation dissipating centres. It is hypothesized that lutein occupies sites L2 and V1 in light-harvesting chlorophyll protein complexes of photosystem II, facilitating enhanced photoprotection through the superior singlet and/or triplet chlorophyll quenching capacity of lutein.
