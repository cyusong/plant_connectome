Identification of stable major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield-related traits is important for yield potential improvement in wheat breeding. In the present study, we genotyped a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population using the Wheat 660K SNP array and constructed a high-density genetic map. The genetic map showed high collinearity with the wheat genome assembly. Fourteen yield-related traits were evaluated in six environments for QTL analysis. A total of 12 environmentally stable QTLs were identified in at least three environments, explaining up to 34.7% of the phenotypic variation. Of these, <i>QTkw-1B.2</i> for thousand kernel weight (TKW), <i>QPh-2D.1</i> (<i>QSl-2D.2/QScn-2D.1</i>) for plant height (PH), spike length (SL) and spikelet compactness (SCN), <i>QPh-4B.1</i> for PH, and <i>QTss-7A.3</i> for total spikelet number per spike (TSS) were detected in at least five environments. A set of Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers were converted based on the above QTLs and used to genotype a diversity panel comprising of 190 wheat accessions across four growing seasons. <i>QPh-2D.1</i> (<i>QSl-2D.2/QScn-2D.1</i>), <i>QPh-4B.1</i> and <i>QTss-7A.3</i> were successfully validated. Compared with previous studies, <i>QTkw-1B.2</i> and <i>QPh-4B.1</i> should be novel QTLs. These results provided a solid foundation for further positional cloning and marker-assisted selection of the targeted QTLs in wheat breeding programs.
