Chlorella viruses are a source of interesting membrane transport proteins. Here we examine a putative K(+) transporter encoded by virus FR483 and related chlorella viruses. The protein shares sequence and structural features with HAK/KUP/KT-like K(+) transporters from plants, bacteria and fungi. Yeast complementation assays and Rb(+) uptake experiments show that the viral protein, termed HAKCV (high-affinity K(+) transporter of chlorella virus), is functional, with transport characteristics that are similar to those of known K(+) transporters. Expression studies revealed that the protein is expressed as an early gene during viral replication, and proteomics data indicate that it is not packaged in the virion. The function of HAKCV is unclear, but the data refute the hypothesis that the transporter acts as a substitute for viral-encoded K(+) channels during virus infection.
