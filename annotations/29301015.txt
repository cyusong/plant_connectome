Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is primarily caused by chimeric genes located in the mitochondrial genomes. In Brassica juncea, orf288 has been identified as a CMS-associated gene in the hau CMS line; however, neither the specific abortive stage nor the molecular function of the gene have been determined. We therefore characterized the hau CMS line, and found that defective mitochondria affect the development of archesporial cells during the L2 stage, leading to male sterility. The expression level of the orf288 transcript was higher in the male-sterility line than in the fertility-restorer line, although no significant differences were apparent at the protein level. The toxicity region of ORF288 was found to be located near the N-terminus and repressed growth of Escherichia coli. However, transgenic expression of different portions of ORF288 indicated that the region that causes male sterility resides between amino acids 73 and 288, the expression of which in E. coli did not result in growth inhibition. Transcriptome analysis revealed a wide range of genes involved in anther development and mitochondrial function that were differentially expressed in the hau CMS line. This study provides new insights into the hau CMS mechanism by which orf288 affects the fertility of Brassica juncea.
