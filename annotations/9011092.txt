['9011092', 'Chaperonin (Cpn) is one of the molecular chaperones. Cpn10 is a co-factor of  Cpn60, which regulates Cpn60-mediated protein folding. It is known that Cpn10 is  located in mitochondria and chloroplasts in plant cells. The Escherichia coli  homologue of Cpn10 is called GroES. A cDNA for the Cpn10 homologue was isolated  from Arabidopsis thaliana by functional complementation of the E. coli groES  mutant. The cDNA was 647 bp long and encoded a polypeptide of 98 amino acids. The  deduced amino acid sequence showed approximately 50% identity to mammalian  mitochondrial Cpn10s and 30% identity to GroES. A Northern blot analysis revealed  that the mRNA for the Cpn10 homologue was expressed uniformly in various organs  and was markedly induced by heat-shock treatment. The Cpn10 homologue was  constitutively expressed in transgenic tobaccos. Immunogold and immunoblot  analyses following the subcellular fractionation of leaves from transgenic  tobaccos revealed that the Cpn 10 homologue was localized in mitochondria and  accumulated at a high level in transgenic tobaccos.', '1996 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1996.10061119.x', 'Nishimura']
