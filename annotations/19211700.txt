['19211700', 'During phosphate starvation, Snf1-related kinase 1 (SnRK1) activity significantly  decreases compared with plants growing under normal nutritional conditions. An  analysis of the expression of the genes encoding for the catalytic subunits of  SnRK1 showed that these subunits were not affected by phosphate starvation.  Transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants overexpressing the AKIN10  and AKIN11 catalytic subunits fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were  produced, and their localizations were mainly chloroplastic with low but  detectable signals in the cytoplasm. These data were corroborated with an  immunocytochemistry analysis using leaf and root sections with an  anti-AKIN10/AKIN11 antibody. The SnRK1 activity in transgenic plants  overexpressing AKIN11-GFP was reduced by 35% to 40% in phosphate starvation, in  contrast with the results observed in plants overexpressing AKIN10-GFP, which  increased the activity by 100%. No differences in activity were observed in  plants growing in phosphate-sufficient conditions. Biochemical analysis of the  proteins indicated that AKIN11 is specifically degraded under these limited  conditions and that the increase in AKIN10-GFP activity was not due to the  phosphorylation of threonine-175. These results are consistent with an important  role of AKIN10 in signaling during phosphate starvation. Moreover, akin10 mutant  plants were deficient in starch mobilization at night during inorganic phosphate  starvation, and under this condition several genes were up-regulated and  down-regulated, indicating their important roles in the control of general  transcription. This finding reveals novel roles for the different catalytic  subunits during phosphate starvation.', '2009 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.133298', 'Coello']
