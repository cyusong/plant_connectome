Alternatives to synthetic nitrogen fertilizer are needed to reduce the costs of crop production and offset environmental damage. Nitrogen-fixing bacterium <i>Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus</i> has been proposed as a possible biofertilizer for monocot crop production. However, the colonization of <i>G. diazotrophicus</i> in most monocot crops is limited and deep understanding of the response of host plants to <i>G. diazotrophicus</i> colonization is still lacking. In this study, the molecular response of the monocot plant model <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> was studied during <i>G. diazotrophicus</i> root colonization. The gene expression profiles of <i>B. distachyon</i> root tissues colonized by <i>G. diazotrophicus</i> were generated via next-generation RNA sequencing, and investigated through gene ontology and metabolic pathway analysis. The RNA sequencing results indicated that <i>Brachypodium</i> is actively involved in <i>G. diazotrophicus</i> colonization via cell wall synthesis. Jasmonic acid, ethylene, gibberellin biosynthesis. nitrogen assimilation, and primary and secondary metabolite pathways are also modulated to accommodate and control the extent of <i>G. diazotrophicus</i> colonization. Cellulose synthesis is significantly downregulated during colonization. The loss of function mutant for <i>Brachypodium</i> cellulose synthase 8 (<i>BdCESA8</i>) showed decreased cellulose content in xylem and increased resistance to <i>G. diazotrophicus</i> colonization. This result suggested that the cellulose synthesis of the secondary cell wall is involved in <i>G. diazotrophicus</i> colonization. The results of this study provide insights for future research in regard to gene manipulation for efficient colonization of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in <i>Brachypodium</i> and monocot crops.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
