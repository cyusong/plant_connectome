['19339505', 'A large number of thioredoxins (Trxs), small redox proteins, have been identified  from all living organisms. However, many of the physiological roles played by  these proteins remain to be elucidated. We isolated a high M(r) (HMW) form of  h-type Trx from the heat-treated cytosolic extracts of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) suspension cells and designated it as AtTrx-h3. Using bacterially  expressed recombinant AtTrx-h3, we find that it forms various protein structures  ranging from low and oligomeric protein species to HMW complexes. And the  AtTrx-h3 performs dual functions, acting as a disulfide reductase and as a  molecular chaperone, which are closely associated with its molecular structures.  The disulfide reductase function is observed predominantly in the low M(r) forms,  whereas the chaperone function predominates in the HMW complexes. The multimeric  structures of AtTrx-h3 are regulated not only by heat shock but also by redox  status. Two active cysteine residues in AtTrx-h3 are required for disulfide  reductase activity, but not for chaperone function. AtTrx-h3 confers enhanced  heat-shock tolerance in Arabidopsis, primarily through its chaperone function.', '2009 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.135426', 'Lee']
