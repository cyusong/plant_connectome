['15516509', 'Peptidyl Met residues are readily oxidized by reactive oxygen species to form Met  sulfoxide. The enzyme peptide Met sulfoxide reductase (PMSR) catalyzes the  reduction of Met sulfoxides back to Met. In doing so, PMSR is proposed to act as  a last-chance antioxidant, repairing proteins damaged from oxidative stress. To  assess the role of this enzyme in plants, we generated multiple transgenic lines  with altered expression levels of the plastid form of PMSR (PMSR4). In transgenic  plants, PMSR4 expression ranged from 95% to 40% (antisense) and more than 600%  (overexpressing lines) of wild-type plants. Under optimal growing conditions,  there is no effect of the transgene on the phenotype of the plants. When exposed  to different oxidative stress conditions-methyl viologen, ozone, and high  light-differences were observed in the rate of photosynthesis, the maximum  quantum yield (Fv/Fm ratio), and the Met sulfoxide content of the isolated  chloroplast. Plants that overexpressed PMSR4 were more resistant to oxidative  damage localized in the chloroplast, and plants that underexpressed PMSR4 were  more susceptible. The Met sulfoxide levels in proteins of the soluble fraction of  chloroplasts were increased by methyl viologen and ozone, but not by high-light  treatment. Under stress conditions, the overexpression of PMSR4 lowered the  sulfoxide content and underexpression resulted in an overall increase in content.', '2004 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.046656', 'Tien']
