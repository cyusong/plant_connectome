Autophagy, a conserved pathway that carries out the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic material in eukaryotic cells, is critical for plant physiology and development. This process is tightly regulated by ATG13, a core component of the ATG1 kinase complex, which initiates autophagy. Although ATG13 is known to be dephosphorylated immediately after nutrient starvation, the phosphatase regulating this process is poorly understood. Here, we determined that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) septuple mutant (topp-7m) and octuple mutant (topp-8m) of TYPE ONE PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE (TOPP) exhibited significantly reduced tolerance to fixed-carbon (C) starvation due to compromised autophagy activity. Genetic analysis placed TOPP upstream of autophagy. Interestingly, ATG13a was found to be an interactor of TOPP. TOPP directly dephosphorylated ATG13a in vitro and in vivo. We identified 18 phosphorylation sites in ATG13a by LC-MS. Phospho-dead ATG13a at these 18 sites significantly promoted autophagy and increased the tolerance of the atg13ab mutant to fixed-C starvation. The dephosphorylation of ATG13a facilitated ATG1a-ATG13a complex formation. Consistently, the recruitment of ATG13a for ATG1a was markedly inhibited in topp-7m-1. Finally, TOPP-controlled dephosphorylation of ATG13a boosted ATG1a phosphorylation. Taken together, our study reveals the crucial role of TOPP in regulating autophagy by stimulating the formation of the ATG1a-ATG13a complex by dephosphorylating ATG13a in Arabidopsis.
