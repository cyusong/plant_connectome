The eukaryotic transcription factor NF-Y consists of three subunits (A, B, and C), which are encoded in Arabidopsis thaliana in multigene families consisting of 10, 13, and 13 genes, respectively. In principle, all potential combinations of the subunits are possible for the assembly of the heterotrimeric complex. We aimed at assessing the probability of each subunit to participate in the assembly of NF-Y. The evaluation of physical interactions among all members of the NF-Y subunit families indicate a strong requirement for NF-YB/NF-YC heterodimerization before the entire complex can be accomplished. By means of a modified yeast two-hybrid system assembly of all three subunits to a heterotrimeric complex was demonstrated. Using GFP fusion constructs, NF-YA and NF-YC localization in the nucleus was demonstrated, while NF-YB is solely imported into the nucleus as a NF-YC-associated heterodimer NF-YC. This piggyback transport of the two Arabidopsis subunits differs from the import of the NF-Y heterotrimer of heterotrophic organisms. Based on a peptide structure model of the histone-fold-motifs, disulfide bonding among intramolecular conserved cysteine residues of NF-YB, which is responsible for the redox-regulated assembly of NF-YB and NF-YC in human and Aspergillus nidulans, can be excluded for Arabidopsis NF-YB.
