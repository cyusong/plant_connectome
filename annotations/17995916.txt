The quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with arsenic (As) accumulation in rice were mapped using a doubled haploid population established by anther culture of F1 plants from a cross between a Japonica cultivar CJ06 and an Indica cultivar TN1 (Oryza sativa). Four QTLs for arsenic (As) concentrations were detected in the map. At the seedling stage, one QTL was mapped on chromosome 2 for As concentrations in shoots with 24.4% phenotypic variance and one QTL for As concentrations in roots was detected on chromosome 3. At maturity, two QTLs for As concentrations in grains were found on chromosomes 6 and 8, with 26.3 and 35.2% phenotypic variance, respectively. No common loci were detected among these three traits. Interestingly, the QTL on chromosome 8 was found to be colocated for As concentrations in grain at maturity and shoot phosphorus (P) concentrations at seedling stage. These results provide an insight into the genetic basis of As uptake and accumulation in rice, and will be useful in identifying genes associated with As accumulation.
