Polished rice is one of the commonly consumed staple foods across the world. However, it contains limited nutrients especially iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). To identify promising recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for grain Zn and single plant yield, 190 RILs developed from PR116 and Ranbir Basmati were evaluated in two environments (E1 and E2). A subset of 44 contrasting RILs for grain Zn was screened in another two environments (E3 and E4). Phenotypic data was collected for 10 traits, viz., days to 50% flowering, plant height, panicle length, number of tillers, single plant yield (SPY), test weight, Fe and Zn in brown (IBR, ZBR), and polished rice (IPR, ZPR). Stepwise regression analysis of trait data in 190 RILs and a subset of 44 RILs revealed the interdependence of ZPR, ZBR, IPR, and IBR and the negative association of grain Zn with single plant yield. Based on the additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype and genotype × environment interaction (GGE) analyses of the subset of 44 RILs across four environments (E1-E4), six promising RILs were identified for ZPR with >28 ppm. Mapping of 190 RILs with 102 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) resulted in 13 QTLs for best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) of traits including advantage over check (AOC). Using genotype-based sequencing (GBS), the subset of 44 RILs was mapped with 1035 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 21 QTLs were identified. More than 100 epistatic interactions were observed. A major QTL <i>qZPR.1.1</i> (PV 37.84%) and another QTL <i>qZPR.11.1</i> (PV 15.47%) were identified for grain Zn in polished rice. A common major QTL (<i>qZBR.2.1</i> and <i>qZPR.2.1</i>) was also identified on chromosome 2 for grain Zn content across SSR and SNP maps. Two potential candidate genes related to transporters were identified based on network analyses in the genomic regions of QTL < 3 Mb. The RILs identified for grain Zn and SPY were nominated for national evaluation as under rice biofortification, and two QTLs identified based on BLUEs could be used in the rice biofortification breeding programs.
