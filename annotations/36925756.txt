The core microbiota of plants exerts key effects on plant performance and resilience to stress. The aim of this study was to identify the core endophytic mycobiome in <i>U. minor</i> stems and disentangle associations between its composition and the resistance to Dutch elm disease (DED). We also defined its spatial variation within the tree and among distant tree populations. Stem samples were taken i) from different heights of the crown of a 168-year-old elm tree, ii) from adult elm trees growing in a common garden and representing a gradient of resistance to DED, and iii) from trees growing in two distant natural populations, one of them with varying degrees of vitality. Endophyte composition was profiled by high throughput sequencing of the first internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1) of the ribosomal DNA. Three families of yeasts (Buckleyzymaceae, Trichomeriaceae and Bulleraceae) were associated to DED-resistant hosts. A small proportion (10%) of endophytic OTUs was almost ubiquitous throughout the crown while tree colonization by most fungal taxa followed stochastic patterns. A clear distinction in endophyte composition was found between geographical locations. By combining all surveys, we found evidence of a <i>U. minor</i> core mycobiome, pervasive within the tree and ubiquitous across locations, genotypes and health status.
