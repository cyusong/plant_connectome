['11080161', 'An Arabidopsis thaliana line that is mutant for the R2R3 MYB gene, AtMYB4, shows  enhanced levels of sinapate esters in its leaves. The mutant line is more  tolerant of UV-B irradiation than wild type. The increase in sinapate ester  accumulation in the mutant is associated with an enhanced expression of the gene  encoding cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, which appears to be the principal target of  AtMYB4 and an effective rate limiting step in the synthesis of sinapate ester  sunscreens. AtMYB4 expression is downregulated by exposure to UV-B light,  indicating that derepression is an important mechanism for acclimation to UV-B in  A.thaliana. The response of target genes to AtMYB4 repression is dose dependent,  a feature that operates under physiological conditions to reinforce the silencing  effect of AtMYB4 at high activity. AtMYB4 works as a repressor of target gene  expression and includes a repression domain. It belongs to a novel group of plant  R2R3 MYB proteins involved in transcriptional silencing. The balance between MYB  activators and repressors on common target promoters may provide extra  flexibility in transcriptional control.', '2000 Nov 15', 'EMBO J', '10.1093/emboj/19.22.6150', 'Martin']
