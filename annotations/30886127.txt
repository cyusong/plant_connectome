Pollen and microspore development are essential steps in the life cycle of all land plants that generate male gametes. Within flowering plants, pollen development occurs inside of the anther. Here, we report the identification of two class III peroxidase-encoding genes, <i>PEROXIDASE9</i> (<i>PRX9</i>) and <i>PRX40</i>, that are genetically redundant and essential for proper anther and pollen development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Arabidopsis double mutants devoid of functional <i>PRX9</i> and <i>PRX40</i> are male sterile. The mutant anthers display swollen, hypertrophic tapetal cells and pollen grains, suggesting disrupted cell wall integrity. These phenotypes lead to nearly 100%-penetrant pollen degeneration upon anther maturation. Using immunochemical and biochemical approaches, we show that PRX9 and PRX40 likely cross-link extensins to contribute to tapetal cell wall integrity during anther development. This work suggests that <i>PRX9</i> and <i>PRX40</i> encode Arabidopsis extensin peroxidases and highlights the importance of extensin cross-linking during pollen development.
