In plant cells, mitochondria are ideally positioned to sense and balance changes in energy metabolism in response to changing environmental conditions. Retrograde signaling from mitochondria to the nucleus is crucial for adjusting the required transcriptional responses. We show that ANAC017, the master regulator of mitochondrial stress, directly recruits a signaling cascade involving the plant hormones ethylene and auxin as well as the MAP KINASE KINASE (MKK) 9-MAP KINASE (MPK) 3/6 pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing and overexpression demonstrated that ANAC017 directly regulates several genes of the ethylene and auxin pathways, including MKK9, 1-AMINO-CYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHASE 2, and YUCCA 5, in addition to genes encoding transcription factors regulating plant growth and stress responses such as BASIC REGION/LEUCINE ZIPPER MOTIF (bZIP) 60, bZIP53, ANAC081/ATAF2, and RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH1. A time-resolved RNA-seq experiment established that ethylene signaling precedes the stimulation of auxin signaling in the mitochondrial stress response, with a large part of the transcriptional regulation dependent on ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3. These results were confirmed by mutant analyses. Our findings identify the molecular components controlled by ANAC017, which integrates the primary stress responses to mitochondrial dysfunction with whole plant growth via the activation of regulatory and partly antagonistic feedback loops.
