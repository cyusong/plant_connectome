['33604650', 'Arabidopsis thaliana CONSTANS (CO) is an essential transcription factor that  promotes flowering by activating the expression of the floral integrator  FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). A number of histone modification enzymes involved in the  regulation of flowering have been identified, but the involvement of epigenetic  mechanisms in the regulation of the core flowering regulator CO remains unclear.  Previous studies have indicated that the transcription factors, FLOWERING BHLH1  (FBH1), FBH2, FBH3, and FBH4, function redundantly to activate the expression of  CO. In this study, we found that the KDM3 group H3K9 demethylase JMJ28 interacts  with the FBH transcription factors to activate CO by removing the repressive mark  H3K9me2. The occupancy of JMJ28 on the CO locus is decreased in the fbh quadruple  mutant, suggesting that the binding of JMJ28 is dependent on FBHs. Furthermore,  genome-wide occupancy profile analyses indicate that the binding of JMJ28 to the  genome overlaps with that of FBH3, indicating a functional association of JMJ28  and FBH3. Together, these results indicate that Arabidopsis JMJ28 functions as a  CO activator by interacting with the FBH transcription factors to remove H3K9me2  from the CO locus.', '2021 May 31', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab014', 'ORCID:']
