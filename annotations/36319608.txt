Maize (Zea mays) terpenoid phytoalexins (MTPs) induced by multiple fungi display extensive antimicrobial activities, yet how maize precisely regulates MTP accumulation upon pathogen infection remains elusive. In this study, pretreatment with jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET)-related inhibitors significantly reduced Fusarium graminearum-induced MTP accumulation and resulted in enhanced susceptibility to F. graminearum, indicating the involvement of JA/ET in MTP regulatory network. ZmEREB92 positively regulated MTP biosynthetic gene (MBG) expression by correlation analysis. Knockout of ZmEREB92 significantly compromised maize resistance to F. graminearum with delayed induction of MBGs and attenuated MTP accumulation. The activation of ZmEREB92 on MBGs is dependent on the interaction with ZmMYC2, which directly binds to MBG promoters. ZmJAZ14 interacts both with ZmEREB92 and with ZmMYC2 in a competitive manner to negatively regulate MBG expression. Altogether, our findings illustrate the regulatory mechanism for JA/ET-mediated MTP accumulation upon F. graminearum infection with the involvement of ZmEREB92, ZmMYC2, and ZmJAZ14, which provides new insights into maize disease responses.
