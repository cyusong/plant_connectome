In plants, an electrical potential and circumnutation disturbances are a part of a response to environmental and internal stimuli. Precise relations between electrical potential changes and circumnutation mechanisms are unclear. We have found recently that glutamate (Glu) injection into Helianthus annuus stem induced a series of action potentials (APs) and a transient decrease in circumnutation activity. A theoretical explanation for this finding is discussed here taking into considerations data about the ion mechanism of AP and circumnutation as well as about the metabolic and signaling pathways of glutamate and their possible interactions.
