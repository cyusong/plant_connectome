Two-component signalling (TCS) systems play important roles in cytokinin and ethylene signalling in Arabidopsis thaliana. Although the involvement of histidine kinases (AHKs) in drought stress responses has been described, their role and that of histidine phosphotransferases (AHPs) in guard cell signalling remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the roles of TCS genes, the histidine phosphotransferase AHP2 and the histidine kinases AHK2 and AHK3, previously reported to play roles in cytokinin and abscisic acid (ABA) signalling. We show that AHP2 is present in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and is involved in light-induced opening. We also present evidence that there is some redistribution of AHP2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm on addition of ABA. In addition, we provide data to support a role for the cytokinin receptors AHK2 and AHK3 in light-induced stomatal opening and, by inference, in controlling the stomatal sensitivity to ABA. Our results provide new insights into the operation of TCS in plants, cross-talk in stomatal signalling and, in particular, the process of light-induced stomatal opening.
