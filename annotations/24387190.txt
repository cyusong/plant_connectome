Understanding the relationship between nitrogen (N) availability and stand health in forest ecosystems is crucial, because a large proportion of European forests is subjected to N-deposition levels beyond their retention capacity. We used data from a long-term forest monitoring programme (ICP Forests) to test the relationship between an index of N availability, foliar nitrogen : phosphorus (N : P) ratios, tree defoliation and discoloration. We hypothesized a segmented response of stand health to N : P ratios and an improved model-fit after correcting for climatic covariates. In accordance with the hypothesis, we found a segmented response with a breakpoint for conifer defoliation at N : P ratios as low as 7.3. Inclusion of climatic variables improved the fit of the models, but there was significant collinearity with N : P. Increases in N availability appear, at least for conifers, to have a negative effect on tree health even under N-limiting conditions. Regulation of N-deposition levels is consequently as timely as ever. We propose that increases in tree defoliation, other than resulting in serious plant fitness issues, may represent early diagnostic symptoms of N-addition related imbalances.
