Soil flooding is a compound abiotic stress that alters soil properties and limits atmospheric gas diffusion (O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>) to the roots. The involvement of abscisic acid (ABA) in the regulation of soil flooding-specific genetic and metabolic responses has been scarcely studied despite its key importance as regulator in other abiotic stress conditions. To attain this objective, wild type and ABA-deficient tomatoes were subjected to short-term (24 h) soil waterlogging. After this period, gas exchange parameters were reduced in the wild type but not in ABA-deficient plants that always had higher <i>E</i> and <i>g</i> <sub><i>s</i></sub> . Transcript and metabolite alterations were more intense in waterlogged tissues, with genotype-specific variations. Waterlogging reduced the ABA levels in the roots while inducing PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors and ABA-dependent transcription factor transcripts, of which induction was less pronounced in the ABA-deficient genotype. Ethylene/O<sub>2</sub>-dependent genetic responses (ERFVIIs, plant anoxia survival responses, and genes involved in the N-degron pathway) were induced in hypoxic tissues independently of the genotype. Interestingly, genes encoding a nitrate reductase and a phytoglobin involved in NO biosynthesis and scavenging and ERFVII stability were induced in waterlogged tissues, but to a lower extent in ABA-deficient tomato. At the metabolic level, flooding-induced accumulation of Ala was enhanced in ABA-deficient lines following a differential accumulation of Glu and Asp in both hypoxic and aerated tissues, supporting their involvement as sources of oxalacetate to feed the tricarboxylic acid cycle in waterlogged tissues and constituting a potential advantage upon long periods of soil waterlogging. The promoter analysis of upregulated genes indicated that the production of oxalacetate from Asp <i>via</i> Asp oxidase, energy processes such as acetyl-CoA, ATP, and starch biosynthesis, and the lignification process were likely subjected to ABA regulation. Taken together, these data indicate that ABA depletion in waterlogged tissues acts as a positive signal, inducing several specific genetic and metabolic responses to soil flooding.

ABA: !regulates! genetic/metabolic responses
ABA: !reduces! in waterlogged tissues
Ethylene/O<sub>2</sub>: !induces! genetic responses
Glu/Asp: !accumulate! differently in hypoxic/aerated tissues
Oxalacetate: !produced from! Asp
ABA: !regulates! oxalacetate production/energy processes/lignification
