Abscisic acid (ABA)-activated inward Ca2+-permeable channels in the plasma membrane (PM) of guard cells are required for the initiation and regulation of ABA-specific cytosolic Ca2+ signaling and stomatal closure in plants. But the identities of the PM Ca2+ channels are still unknown. We hypothesized that the ABA-activated Ca2+ channels consist of multiple CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNEL (CNGC) proteins from the CNGC family, which is known as a Ca2+-permeable channel family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In this research, we observed high expression of multiple CNGC genes in Arabidopsis guard cells, namely CNGC5, CNGC6, CNGC9, and CNGC12. The T-DNA insertional loss-of-function quadruple mutant cngc5-1 cngc6-2 cngc9-1 cngc12-1 (hereafter c5/6/9/12) showed a strong ABA-insensitive phenotype of stomatal closure. Further analysis revealed that ABA-activated Ca2+ channel currents were impaired, and ABA-specific cytosolic Ca2+ oscillation patterns were disrupted in c5/6/9/12 guard cells compared with in wild-type guard cells. All ABA-related phenotypes of the c5/6/9/12 mutant were successfully rescued by the expression of a single gene out of the four CNGCs under the respective native promoter. Thus, our findings reveal a type of ABA-activated PM Ca2+ channel comprising multiple CNGCs, which is essential for ABA-specific Ca2+ signaling of guard cells and ABA-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis.
