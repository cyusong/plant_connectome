The development of an infection in soybean [Glycine max L. cultivar (cv.) Peking] roots by incompatible (I) and compatible (C) populations of soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines) was assayed using an AffymetriX soybean GeneChip. This time-course microarray analysis, using 37,744 probe sets, measured transcript abundance during I and C. These analyses reveal that infection by individual I and C H. glycines populations influence the transcription of G. max genes differently. A substantial difference in gene expression is present between I and C at 12 h post infection. Thus, G. max can differentiate between I and C nematode populations even before they have begun to select their feeding sites. The microarray analysis identified genes induced earlier in infection during I than C. MA also identified amplitude differences in transcript abundance between I and C reactions. Some of the probe sets measuring increased transcript levels during I represented no apical meristem (NAM) and WRKY transcription factors as well as NBS-LRR kinases. Later during I, heat shock protein (HSPs) probe sets (i.e. HSP90, HSP70, ClpB/HSP101) measured increased transcript abundance. These results demonstrate that G. max roots respond very differently to the different H. glycines races even before their feeding site selection has occurred. The ability of G. max to engage an I reaction, thus, appears to be dependent on the ability of root cells to recognize the different races of H. glycines because these experiments were conducted in the identical G. max genetic background.
