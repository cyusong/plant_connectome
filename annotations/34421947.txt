Foxtail millet (<i>Setaria Italica</i> L.) plays a principal role in food security in Africa and Asia, but it is sensitive to a variety of herbicides. This study was performed to clarify whether pyrazosulfuron-methyl can be used in foxtail millet fields and the effect of pyrazosulfuron-methyl on the photosynthetic performance of foxtail millet. Two foxtail millet varieties (Jingu 21 and Zhangzagu 10) were subjected to five doses (0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 g ai ha<sup>-1</sup>) of pyrazosulfuron-methyl in pot and field experiments. The plant height, leaf area, stem diameter, photosynthetic pigment contents, gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, antioxidant enzyme activities, and antioxidant contents at 7 and 15 days after pyrazosulfuron-methyl application, and the yield of foxtail millet were measured. The results suggested that pyrazosulfuron-methyl inhibited the growth of foxtail millet and reduced the photosynthetic pigment contents, photosynthetic rate, and photosynthetic system II activity. Similarly, pyrazosulfuron-methyl decreased the antioxidant enzyme activities and antioxidant contents. These results also indicated that the toxicity of pyrazosulfuron-methyl to foxtail millet was decreased gradually with the extension of time after application; however, the foxtail millet yield was still significantly reduced. Therefore, pyrazosulfuron-methyl is not recommended for application in foxtail millet fields.
