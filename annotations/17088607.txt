['17088607', 'Coordination between cell proliferation and differentiation is essential to  create organized and functional tissues. Arabidopsis thaliana stomata are created  through a stereotyped series of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions whose  frequency and orientation are informed by cell-cell interactions. Receptor-like  proteins and a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase were previously  identified as negative regulators of stomatal development; here, we present the  characterization of a bona fide positive regulator. FAMA is a putative basic  helix-loop-helix transcription factor whose activity is required to promote  differentiation of stomatal guard cells and to halt proliferative divisions in  their immediate precursors. Ectopic FAMA expression is also sufficient to confer  stomatal character. Physical and genetic interaction studies combined with  functional characterization of FAMA domains suggest that stomatal development  relies on regulatory complexes distinct from those used to specify other plant  epidermal cells. FAMA behavior provides insights into the control of  differentiation in cells produced through the activity of self-renewing  populations.', '2006 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.046136', 'Bergmann']
