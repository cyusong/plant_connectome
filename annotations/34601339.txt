The Mediator complex acts as a bridge between specific transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery and plays a central role in plant immunity. Biological induction of plant resistance against pathogens requires endogenous hormone jasmonic acid (JA) and involves profound transcriptional changes controlled by the key transcription factor MYC2. Arabidopsis thaliana Mediator subunit 25 (AtMED25) regulates JA-dependent defense response through interacting with MYC2. Here, we report that the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum, Sl) Mediator subunit 8 (SlMED8) is another essential component in JA-dependent defense response. The transcript levels of SlMED8 could not be affected by treatment with MeJA, SA, ABA, and mechanical wounding. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that SlMED8 could interact with itself, SlMYC2, and SlMED25, respectively. In addition, ectopic overexpression of SlMED8 complemented the late flowering and pathogen hypersensitivity phenotypes of Arabidopsis med8 mutant. Overexpression of SlMED8 rendered transgenic plants higher tolerance to necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Meanwhile, SlMED8 antisense plants displayed compromised resistance to Botrytis cinerea. Consistent with this, differential expression levels of several JA-responsive genes were detected within the transgenic plants. Overall, our results identified an important control point in the regulation of the JA signaling pathway within the transcriptional machinery.
