Abscisic acid (ABA) has been postulated to play a role in the development of freezing tolerance during the cold acclimation process in higher plants, but its role in cold tolerance in tower land plants has not been elucidated. The moss Physcomitrella patens rapidly developed freezing tolerance when its protonemata were grown in a medium containing ABA, with dramatic changes in the LT50 value from -2 degrees C to over -10 degrees C. We examined physiological and morphological alterations in protonema cells caused by ABA treatment to elucidate early cellular events responsible for rapid enhancement of freezing tolerance. Microscopic observations revealed that ABA treatment for 1 day resulted in a dramatic alteration in the appearance of intracellular organelles. ABA-treated cells had slender chloroplasts, with a reduced amount of starch grains, in comparison with those of non-treated cells. The ABA-treated cells also had several segmented vacuoles while many of non-treated cells had one central vacuole. When frozen to -4 degrees C, freezing injury-associated ultrastructural changes such as formation of aparticulate domains and fracture-jump lesions were frequently observed in the plasma membrane of non-treated protonema cells but not in that of ABA-treated cells. The ABA treatment increased the osmotic concentration of the protonema cells, in correlation with accumulation of free soluble sugars. These results suggest that ABA-induced accumulation of soluble sugars, associated with morphological changes in organelles, mitigated freezing-induced structural damage in the plasma membrane, eventually leading to enhancement of freezing tolerance in the protonema cells.
