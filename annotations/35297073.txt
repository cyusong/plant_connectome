Crop wild relatives, the closely related species of crops, may harbour potentially important sources of new allelic diversity for (a)biotic tolerance or resistance. However, to date, wild diversity is only poorly characterized and evaluated. Banana has a large wild diversity but only a narrow proportion is currently used in breeding programmes. The main objective of this study was to evaluate genotype-dependent transpiration responses in relation to the environment. By applying continuous high-throughput phenotyping, we were able to construct genotype-specific transpiration response models in relation to light, VPD and soil water potential. We characterized and evaluated six (sub)species and discerned four phenotypic clusters. Significant differences were observed in leaf area, cumulative transpiration and transpiration efficiency. We confirmed a general stomatal-driven 'isohydric' drought avoidance behaviour, but discovered genotypic differences in the onset and intensity of stomatal closure. We pinpointed crucial genotype-specific soil water potentials when drought avoidance mechanisms were initiated and when stress kicked in. Differences between (sub)species were dependent on environmental conditions, illustrating the need for high-throughput dynamic phenotyping, modelling and validation. We conclude that the banana wild relatives contain useful drought tolerance traits, emphasising the importance of their conservation and potential for use in breeding programmes.
