The acid-tolerant green alga Chlamydomonas (UTCC 121) grows in media ranging in pH from 2.5 to 7.0. Determination of the overall internal pH of the cells, using (14)C-benzoic acid (BA) or [2-(14)C]-5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione (DMO), showed that the cells maintain a neutral pH (6.6 to 7.2) over an external pH range of 3.0-7.0. The cells express an external carbonic anhydrase (CA) when grown in media above pH 5.5, and CA increases to a maximum at pH 7.0. Removal of external CA by trypsin digestion or by acetazolamide (AZA) inhibition indicated that CA was essential for photosynthesis at pH 7.0 and that the cells had no capacity for direct bicarbonate uptake. Monitoring of CO(2) uptake and O(2) evolution by mass spectrometry during photosynthesis did not provide any evidence of active CO(2) uptake. The CO(2) compensation concentration of the cells ranged from 9.4 microM at pH 4.5 to 16.2 microM at pH 7.0. An examination of the kinetics of ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), in homogenates of cells grown at pH 7.0, showed that the K(m) (CO(2)) was 16.3 microM. These data indicate that the pH between the cell interior and the external medium was large enough at acid pH to allow the accumulation of inorganic carbon (Ci) by the diffusive uptake of CO(2), and the expression of external CA at neutral pH values would maintain an equilibrium CO(2) concentration at the cell surface. This species does not possess a CO(2)-concentrating mechanism because the whole cell affinity for Ci appears to be determined by the low K(m) (CO(2)) Rubisco of the alga.
