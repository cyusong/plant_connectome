Bacterial blight, which is one of the most common soybean diseases, is responsible for considerable yield losses. In this study, a novel <i>Xanthomonas vasicola</i> strain was isolated from the leaves of soybean plants infected with bacterial blight under field conditions. Sequencing the <i>X. vasicola</i> genome revealed type-III effector-coding genes. Moreover, the <i>hrpG</i> deletion mutant was constructed. To identify the soybean genes responsive to HrpG, two chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) carrying the wild soybean genome, but with opposite phenotypes following <i>Xanthomonas</i> inoculations, were used to analyze gene expression networks based on RNA sequencing at three time points after inoculations with wild-type <i>Xanthomonas</i> or the <i>hrpG</i> deletion mutant. To further identify the hub genes underlying soybean responses to HrpG, the genes located on the substituted chromosome segments were examined. Finally, a combined analysis with the QTLs for resistance to <i>Xanthomonas</i> identified 35 hub genes in the substituted chromosomal segments that may help regulate soybean responses to <i>Xanthomonas</i> and HrpG. Furthermore, two candidate genes in the CSSLs might play pivotal roles in response to <i>Xanthomonas.</i>
