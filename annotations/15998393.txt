Here, we examined the effectiveness of two approaches for reducing cadmium (Cd) accumulation in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var durum) grain: the application of supplemental zinc (Zn), and the use of cultivars exhibiting reduced grain Cd concentrations. Two durum wheat near-isogenic lines (NIL) that differ in grain Cd accumulation were grown to maturity in solution culture containing a chelating agent to buffer the free activities of Zn and Cd at levels approximating those of field conditions. The low Cd accumulating (L-Cd) isoline had Cd concentrations, in grains and shoot parts, which were 60-70% lower than those of the high Cd accumulating (H-Cd) isoline. Increasing the Zn activities in the nutrient solution from deficient to sufficient levels reduced the concentration of Cd in grains and vegetative shoot parts of both isolines. The results suggest that supplemental Zn reduces Cd tissue concentrations by inhibiting Cd uptake into roots. Cd partitioning patterns between roots and shoots and between spike components suggest that the physiological basis for the low Cd trait is related to the compartmentation or symplasmic translocation of Cd.

Zn: !reduces! Cd concentration
Cd: !partitions between! roots and shoots
Cd: !translocates! symplasmically
L-Cd isoline: !exhibits! lower Cd concentrations
H-Cd isoline: !exhibits! higher Cd concentrations
Zn: !inhibits! Cd uptake into roots
