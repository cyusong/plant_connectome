Flax is an important fiber crop that is subject to lodging. In order to gain more information about the potential role of the bast fiber cell wall in the return to the vertical position, 6-week-old flax plants were subjected to a long-term (6 week) gravitropic stress by stem tilting in an experimental set-up that excluded autotropism. Stress induced significant morphometric changes (lumen surface, lumen diameter, and cell wall thickness and lumen surface/total fiber surface ratio) in pulling- and opposite-side fibers compared to control fibers. Changes in the relative amounts and spatial distribution of cell wall polymers in flax bast fibers were determined by Raman vibrational spectroscopy. Following spectra acquisition, datasets (control, pulling- and opposite sides) were analyzed by principal component analysis, PC score imaging, and Raman chemical cartography of significant chemical bonds. Our results show that gravitropic stress induces discrete but significant changes in the composition and/or spatial organization of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin within the cell walls of both pulling side and opposite side fibers.
