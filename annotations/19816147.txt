The biogenesis and function of chloroplast are controlled both by anterograde mechanisms involving nuclear-encoded proteins targeted to chloroplast and by retrograde signals from plastid to nucleus contributing to regulation of nuclear gene expression. A number of experimental evidences support the implication of chlorophyll biosynthesis intermediates on the retrograde signaling, albeit an earlier-postulated direct link between accumulation of chlorophyll intermediates and changes in nuclear gene expression has recently been challenged. By characterization of Arabidopsis mutants lacking the chloroplast localized NADPH-thioredoxin reductase (NTRC) we have recently proposed that imbalanced activity of chlorophyll biosynthesis in developing cells modifies the chloroplast signals leading to alterations in nuclear gene expression. These signals appear to initiate from temporal perturbations in the flux through the pathway from protoporphyrin to protochlorophyllide rather than from the accumulation of a single intermediate of the tetrapyr-role pathway.
