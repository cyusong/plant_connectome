The present study reports the cloning of a 581 bp sequence, designated as SbEST8, from the osmotically stressed germinated seeds of a drought tolerant cultivar of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). The SbEST8, which shows no homology with the reported gene sequences, is present in multiple copies and lacks restriction fragment length polymorphism among different sorghum cultivars. The expression of SbEST8 in the germinating seeds of sorghum was modulated by different abiotic stresses. Kinetic studies revealed that imposition of osmotic stress after 8h resulted in maximum levels of SbEST8 mRNA in the germinating seeds of cv. ICSV-272, with further stress causing a decline to undetectable levels by 16 h. However, relieving the stress after 12h resulted in an enhancement of SbEST8 mRNA levels for at least another 4h following which it declined. The decrease in SbEST8 mRNA levels in the leaves at 30 DAS in response to drought stress was observed only in the drought susceptible cultivar (CSV-216), whereas its expression was either increased substantially or remained unaffected in the tolerant cultivars, thus suggesting its role in water stress tolerance.
