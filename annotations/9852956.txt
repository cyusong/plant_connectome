['9852956', 'The yeast Abc1 protein acts as a chaperone-like protein essential for the proper  conformation and efficient functioning of the respiratory complex III. By  functional complementation of a yeast abc1 mutant, we have identified an  Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA that corresponds to a single copy gene and encodes a  protein sharing 45% similarity with the yeast Abc1p protein. Cytochrome spectra  and respiratory activity measurements have shown that the plant protein allows a  partial restoration of the complex III activity. No major difference in the  steady-state level of ABC1At mRNA was observed in various plant tissues,  suggesting that ABC1At is constitutively expressed in A. thaliana. Phylogenetic  analysis revealed that the Abc1At protein belongs to a large family of proteins  composed of two eukaryotic and one prokaryotic subgroups differing by their  degree of similarity and probably by their function.', '1998 Oct 9', 'Gene', '10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00417-x', 'Dujardin']
