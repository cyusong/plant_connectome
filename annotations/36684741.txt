The contrasting soil management in flooded-transplanted rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and dry-tilled wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) poses a challenge for improving low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of the rice-wheat system. Integration of organics in nutrient management can bring in changes favoring efficient N uptake <i>via</i> changes in growing conditions and soil responses. This study reported the results of a 15-year-long experiment on integrated nutrient management (INM) systems for rice-wheat cropping. The INM included substituting ~50% of chemical fertilizers <i>via</i> (i) including a legume crop (<i>Vigna radiata</i>) in the sequence and its biomass incorporation (LE), (ii) green manuring with <i>Sesbania aculeata</i> (GM), (iii) farmyard manure application (FYM), (iv) 1/3 wheat stubble <i>in situ</i> retention (WS), and (v) 1/3 rice stubble <i>in situ</i> retention. The INM strategies resulted in improved NUE compared to 100% chemical fertilizers (F). The INM had significantly higher net N mineralization and improved biological activity aligning with the NUE trends. The reductions in redox potential (Eh) and pH during rice season improved NUE under integrated management. Highly reduced conditions favored N mineralization and plant availability in form of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msubsup><mrow><mtext>NH</mtext></mrow> <mn>4</mn> <mo>+</mo></msubsup> <mo>-</mo> <mtext>N</mtext></mrow> </math> resulting in enhanced uptake efficiency, in rice crop. The soil organic carbon (C) significantly increased in INM, and an effect of the active C fractions was evident on the NUE of the wheat crop. The results showed that these INM strategies can immensely benefit the rice-wheat system <i>via</i> improvement in biological health along with electrochemical changes for flooded rice, and labile-C-assisted improvement in soil conditions for wheat.
