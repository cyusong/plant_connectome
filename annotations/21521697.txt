['21521697', 'In plant cells, mitochondria and plastids contain their own genomes derived from  the ancestral bacteria endosymbiont. Despite their limited genetic capacity,  these multicopy organelle genomes account for a substantial fraction of total  cellular DNA, raising the question of whether organelle DNA quantity is  controlled spatially or temporally. In this study, we genetically dissected the  organelle DNA decrease in pollen, a phenomenon that appears to be common in most  angiosperm species. By staining mature pollen grains with fluorescent DNA dye, we  screened Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants in which extrachromosomal DNAs had  accumulated. Such a recessive mutant, termed defective in pollen organelle DNA  degradation1 (dpd1), showing elevated levels of DNAs in both plastids and  mitochondria, was isolated and characterized. DPD1 encodes a protein belonging to  the exonuclease family, whose homologs appear to be found in angiosperms. Indeed,  DPD1 has Mg(2)(+)-dependent exonuclease activity when expressed as a fusion protein  and when assayed in vitro and is highly active in developing pollen. Consistent  with the dpd phenotype, DPD1 is dual-targeted to plastids and mitochondria.  Therefore, we provide evidence of active organelle DNA degradation in the  angiosperm male gametophyte, primarily independent of maternal inheritance; the  biological function of organellar DNA degradation in pollen is currently unclear.', '2011 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.084012', 'Sakamoto']
