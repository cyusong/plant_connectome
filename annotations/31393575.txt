['31393575', 'In plants, the stem cells that form the shoot system reside within the shoot  apical meristem (SAM), which is regulated by feedback signaling between the  WUSCHEL (WUS) homeobox protein and CLAVATA (CLV) peptides and receptors. WUS-CLV  feedback signaling can be modulated by various endogenous or exogenous factors,  such as chromatin state, hormone signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS)  signaling and nutrition, leading to a dynamic control of SAM size corresponding  to meristem activity. Despite these insights, however, the knowledge of genes  that control SAM size is still limited, and in particular, the regulation by ROS  signaling is only beginning to be comprehended. In this study, we report a new  function in maintenance of SAM size, encoded by the OKINA KUKI1 (OKI1) gene. OKI1  is expressed in the SAM and encodes a mitochondrial aspartyl tRNA synthetase  (AspRS). oki1 mutants display enlarged SAMs with abnormal expression of WUS and  CLV3 and overaccumulation of ROS in the meristem. Our findings support the  importance of normal AspRS function in the maintenance of the WUS-CLV3 feedback  loop and SAM size.', '2019 Nov 1', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcz153', 'Jackson']
