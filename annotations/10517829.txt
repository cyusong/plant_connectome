['10517829', 'To obtain information on the synthesis and function of arabinosylated glycans,  the mur4 mutant of Arabidopsis was characterized. This mutation leads to a 50%  reduction in the monosaccharide L-arabinose in most organs and affects  arabinose-containing pectic cell wall polysaccharides and arabinogalactan  proteins. Feeding L-arabinose to mur4 plants restores the cell wall composition  to wild-type levels, suggesting a partial defect in the de novo synthesis of  UDP-L-arabinose, the activated sugar used by arabinosyltransferases. The defect  was traced to the conversion of UDP-D-xylose to UDP-L-arabinose in the microsome  fraction of leaf material, indicating that mur4 plants are defective in a  membrane-bound UDP-D-xylose 4-epimerase.', '1999 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.121.2.383', 'Reiter']
