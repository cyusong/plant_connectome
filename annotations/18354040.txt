We describe a simple and highly effective means for global identification of genes that are expressed within specific cell types within complex tissues. It involves transgenic expression of nuclear-targeted green fluorescent protein in a cell-type-specific manner. The fluorescent nuclei are then purified from homogenates by fluorescence-activated sorting, and the RNAs employed as targets for microarray hybridization. We demonstrate the validity of the approach through the identification of 12 genes that are selectively expressed in phloem.
