The adaptive responses of plants to phosphate (Pi) starvation stress are fine-tuned by an elaborate regulatory network. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel Pi starvation-responsive gene, MYB1, encoding an R2R3-type transcription factor in rice. MYB1 was transcriptionally induced in leaf sheaths and old leaf blades. It was localized to the nucleus and expressed mainly in vascular tissues. Mutation of MYB1 led to an increase in Pi uptake and accumulation, accompanied by altered expression of a subset of Pi transporters and several genes involved in Pi starvation signaling. Furthermore, MYB1 affected the elongation of the primary root in a Pi-dependent manner and lateral roots in a Pi-independent manner. Moreover, gibberellic acid (GA)-triggered lateral root elongation was largely suppressed in wild-type plants under Pi starvation conditions, whereas this suppression was partially rescued in myb1 mutant lines, correlating with the up-regulation of a GA biosynthetic gene upon MYB1 mutation. Taken together, the findings of this study highlight the role of MYB1 as a regulator involved in both Pi starvation signaling and GA biosynthesis. Such a co-regulator might have broad implications for the study of cross-talk between nutrient stress and other signaling pathways.
