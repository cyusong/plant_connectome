Aberrant microtubule organization has been recently recorded in dividing root cells of fra2 and lue1 p60-katanin Arabidopsis thaliana mutants. Here, we report similar defects in the bot1 and ktn1-2 mutants of the same plant, proposing that they constitute a consistent phenotype of p60-katanin mutants. In addition, we show that the Targeting Protein for Xklp2 (TPX2) protein co-localizes with microtubules on the surface of prophase nuclei of the mutants, probably participating in multipolar spindle assembly. As microtubule organization defects are not observed in metaphase/anaphase spindles and initiating phragmoplasts, we also discuss the putative association of the observed aberrations with the nuclear envelope and we emphasize on the mechanism of bipolar metaphase spindle organization in the mutants. It seems that chromosome-mediated spindle assembly, probably minimally dependent on microtubule severing by p60-katanin, dominates after nuclear envelope breakdown, restoring bipolarity.
