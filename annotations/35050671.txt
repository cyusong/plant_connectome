['35050671', 'Fertilization of an egg by multiple sperm (polyspermy) leads to lethal genome  imbalance and chromosome segregation defects. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the block  to polyspermy is facilitated by a mechanism that prevents polytubey (the arrival  of multiple pollen tubes to one ovule). We show here that FERONIA, ANJEA, and  HERCULES RECEPTOR KINASE 1 receptor-like kinases located at the septum interact  with pollen tube-specific RALF6, 7, 16, 36, and 37 peptide ligands to establish  this polytubey block. The same combination of RALF (rapid alkalinization factor)  peptides and receptor complexes controls pollen tube reception and rupture inside  the targeted ovule. Pollen tube rupture releases the polytubey block at the  septum, which allows the emergence of secondary pollen tubes upon fertilization  failure. Thus, orchestrated steps in the fertilization process in Arabidopsis are  coordinated by the same signaling components to guarantee and optimize  reproductive success.', '2022 Jan 21', 'Science', '10.1126/science.abl4683', 'ORCID:']
