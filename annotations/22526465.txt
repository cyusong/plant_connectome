['22526465', 'Cytochrome b561 (Cyt-b561) proteins constitute a family of trans-membrane  proteins that are present in a wide variety of organisms. Two of their  characteristic properties are the reducibility by ascorbate (ASC) and the  presence of two distinct b-type hemes localized on two opposite sides of the  membrane. Here we show that the tonoplast-localized and the putative tumor  suppressor Cyt-b561 proteins can be reduced by other reductants than ASC and  dithionite. A detailed spectral analysis of the ASC-dependent and dihydrolipoic  acid (DHLA)-dependent reduction of these two Cyt-b561 proteins is also presented.  Our results are discussed in relation to the known antioxidant capability of DHLA  as well as its role in the regeneration of other antioxidant compounds of cells.  These results allow us to speculate on new biological functions for the  trans-membrane Cyt-b561 proteins.', '2013 Mar', 'Eur Biophys J', '10.1007/s00249-012-0812-x', 'Asard']
