Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) induces stomatal closure accompanied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and glutathione (GSH) depletion in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, stomatal responses to three other isothiocyanates (ITCs), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), sulforaphane (SFN), and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), were investigated in A. thaliana. All these ITCs significantly induced stomatal closure, where PEITC and BITC were most effective. The selected ITCs also induced ROS accumulation, cytosolic alkalization, and GSH depletion in guard cells. Moreover, all ITCs increased the frequency of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) spikes (transient elevation), while PEITC and BITC showed the highest frequency. There was a strong positive correlation between the number of [Ca2+]cyt spikes per guard cell and the decrease in stomatal aperture. Both cytosolic alkalization and GSH content have a positive correlation with the decrease in stomatal aperture, but ROS production did not have a significant correlation with the decrease in stomatal apertures. These results indicate that the molecules with a functional ITC group induce stomatal closure that is accompanied by GSH depletion, cytosolic alkalization, [Ca2+]cyt spikes, and ROS production, and that the former three cellular events, rather than ROS production, are highly correlated with the decrease in stomatal aperture.
