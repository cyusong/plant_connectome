Natural compounds isolated from macroalgae are promising, ecofriendly, and multifunctional bioinoculants, which have been tested and used in agriculture. Ulvans, for instance, one of the major polysaccharides present in <i>Ulva</i> spp. cell walls, have been tested for their plant growth-promoting properties as well as their ability to activate plant immune defense, on a large variety of crops. Recently, we have characterized for the first time an arabinogalactan protein-like (AGP-like) from <i>Ulva lactuca</i>, which exhibits several features associated to land plant AGPs. In land plant, AGPs were shown to play a role in several plant biological functions, including cell morphogenesis, reproduction, and plant-microbe interactions. Thus, isolated AGP-like proteins may be good candidates for either the plant growth-promoting properties or the activation of plant immune defense. Here, we have isolated an AGP-like enriched fraction from <i>Ulva lactuca</i> and we have evaluated its ability to (i) protect oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) cotyledons against <i>Leptosphaeria maculans</i>, and (ii) its ability to activate immune responses. Preventive application of the <i>Ulva</i> AGP-like enriched fraction on oilseed rape, followed by cotyledon inoculation with the fungal hemibiotroph <i>L. maculans</i>, resulted in a major reduction of infection propagation. The noticed reduction correlated with an accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in treated cotyledons and with the activation of SA and ET signaling pathways in oilseed rape cotyledons. In parallel, an ulvan was also isolated from <i>Ulva lactuca</i>. Preventive application of ulvan also enhanced plant resistance against <i>L. maculans</i>. Surprisingly, reduction of infection severity was only observed at high concentration of ulvan. Here, no such significant changes in gene expression and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production were observed. Together, this study indicates that <i>U. lactuca</i> AGP-like glycoproteins exhibit promising elicitor activity and that plant eliciting properties of <i>Ulva</i> extract, might result not only from an ulvan-originated eliciting activities, but also AGP-like originated.
