It is well-documented that phytochromes can control plant growth and development from germination to flowering. Additionally, these photoreceptors have been shown to modulate both biotic and abiotic stress. This has led to a series of studies exploring the molecular and biochemical basis by which phytochromes modulate stresses, such as salinity, drought, high light or herbivory. Evidence for a role of phytrochromes in plant stress tolerance is explored and reviewed.
