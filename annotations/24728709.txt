Indolic secondary metabolites play an important role in pathogen defense in cruciferous plants. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), in addition to the characteristic phytoalexin camalexin, derivatives of indole-3-carbaldehyde (ICHO) and indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICOOH) are synthesized from tryptophan via the intermediates indole-3-acetaldoxime and indole-3-acetonitrile. Based on feeding experiments combined with nontargeted metabolite profiling, their composition in nontreated and silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>)-treated leaf tissue was comprehensively analyzed. As major derivatives, glucose conjugates of 5-hydroxyindole-3-carbaldehyde, ICOOH, and 6-hydroxyindole-3-carboxylic acid were identified. Quantification of ICHO and ICOOH derivative pools after glucosidase treatment revealed that, in response to AgNO<sub>3</sub> treatment, their total accumulation level was similar to that of camalexin. ARABIDOPSIS ALDEHYDE OXIDASE1 (AAO1), initially discussed to be involved in the biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid, and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 71B6 were found to be transcriptionally coexpressed with camalexin biosynthetic genes. CYP71B6 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and shown to efficiently convert indole-3-acetonitrile into ICHO and ICOOH, thereby releasing cyanide. To evaluate the role of both enzymes in the biosynthesis of ICHO and ICOOH derivatives, knockout and overexpression lines for CYP71B6 and AAO1 were established and analyzed for indolic metabolites. The observed metabolic phenotypes suggest that AAO1 functions in the oxidation of ICHO to ICOOH in both nontreated and AgNO<sub>3</sub>-treated leaves, whereas CYP71B6 is relevant for ICOOH derivative biosynthesis specifically after induction. In summary, a model for the biosynthesis of ICHO and ICOOH derivatives is presented.

AAO1: !oxidizes! ICHO 
CYP71B6: !converts! indole-3-acetonitrile 
AAO1: !relevant for! ICOOH biosynthesis 
CYP71B6: !relevant for! ICOOH derivative biosynthesis
