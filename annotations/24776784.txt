Phytoplasmas are insect-transmitted intracellular plant bacterial pathogens that secrete effector molecules into host cells that interfere with the host's developmental or metabolic processes. Recently, the secreted Aster Yellows phytoplasma strain Witches' Broom protein11 (SAP11) has been shown to act as a virulence factor that alters the development, hormone biosynthesis, phosphate (Pi) homeostasis, and defense responses in the affected plants. We found that SAP11 undergoes proteolytic processing in planta and self-interaction in vitro. These biochemical studies provide foundational insights necessary for the functional characterization of SAP11; however, the biological relevance of post-translational cleavage and self-interaction of SAP11 to its role as a virulence factor warrants further investigation.
