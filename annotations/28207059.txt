['28207059', 'Early embryo development from the zygote is an essential stage in the formation  of the seed, while seedling development is the beginning of the formation of an  individual plant. AtNSE1 and AtNSE3 are subunits of the structural maintenance of  chromosomes (SMC) 5/6 complex and have been identified as non-SMC elements, but  their functions in Arabidopsis growth and development remain as yet unknown. In  this study, we found that loss of function of AtNSE1 and AtNSE3 led to severe  defects in early embryo development. Partially complemented mutants showed that  the development of mutant seedlings was inhibited, that chromosome fragments  occurred during anaphase, and that the cell cycle was delayed at G2/M, which led  to the occurrence of endoreduplication. Further, a large number of DNA  double-strand breaks (DSBs) occurred in the nse1 and nse3 mutants, and the  expression of AtNSE1 and AtNSE3 was up-regulated following treatment of the  plants with DSB inducer compounds, suggesting that AtNSE1 and AtNSE3 have a role  in DNA damage repair. Therefore, we conclude that AtNSE1 and AtNSE3 facilitate  DSB repair and contribute to maintaining genome stability and cell division in  mitotic cells. Thus, we think that AtNSE1 and AtNSE3 may be crucial factors for  maintaining proper early embryonic and post-embryonic development.', '2017 Feb 1', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erx016', 'Zhao']
