['22158464', 'The shoot and root apical meristems (SAM and RAM) formed during embryogenesis are  crucial for postembryonic plant development. We report the identification of  POPCORN (PCN), a gene required for embryo development and meristem organization  in Arabidopsis thaliana. Map-based cloning revealed that PCN encodes a WD-40  protein expressed both during embryo development and postembryonically in the SAM  and RAM. The two pcn alleles identified in this study are temperature sensitive,  showing defective embryo development when grown at 22 degrees C that is rescued when  grown at 29 degrees C. In pcn mutants, meristem-specific expression of WUSCHEL (WUS),  CLAVATA3, and WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX5 is not maintained; SHOOTMERISTEMLESS,  BODENLOS (BDL) and MONOPTEROS (MP) are misexpressed. Several findings link PCN to  auxin signaling and meristem function: ectopic expression of DR5(rev):green  fluorescent protein (GFP), pBDL:BDL-GFP, and pMP:MP-beta-glucuronidase in the  meristem; altered polarity and expression of pPIN1:PIN1-GFP in the apical domain  of the developing embryo; and resistance to auxin in the pcn mutants. The bdl  mutation rescued embryo lethality of pcn, suggesting that improper auxin response  is involved in pcn defects. Furthermore, WUS, PINFORMED1, PINOID, and TOPLESS are  dosage sensitive in pcn, suggesting functional interaction. Together, our results  suggest that PCN functions in the auxin pathway, integrating auxin signaling in  the organization and maintenance of the SAM and RAM.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.091777', 'Datla']
