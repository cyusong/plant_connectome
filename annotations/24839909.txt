['24839909', 'In the life of flowering plants, seed germination is a critical step to ensure  survival into the next generation. Generally the seed prior to germination has  been in a dormant state with a low rate of metabolism. In the transition from a  dormant seed to a germinating seed, various epigenetic mechanisms play a  regulatory role. Here, we demonstrate that the over-expression of chromatin  remodeling ATPase genes (AtCHR12 or AtCHR23) reduced the frequency of seed  germination in Arabidopsis thaliana up to 30% relative to the wild-type seeds. On  the other hand, single loss-of-function mutations of the two genes did not affect  seed germination. The reduction of germination in over-expressing mutants was  more pronounced in stress conditions (salt or high temperature), showing the  impact of the environment. Reduced germinations upon over-expression coincided  with increased transcript levels of seed maturation genes and with reduced  degradation of their mRNAs stored in dry seeds. Our results indicate that  repression of AtCHR12/23 gene expression in germinating wild-type Arabidopsis  seeds is required for full germination. This establishes a functional link  between chromatin modifiers and regulatory networks towards seed maturation and  germination.', '2015 Feb', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/ppl.12231', 'Mlynarova']
