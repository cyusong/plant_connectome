Leaf senescence is a critical process in plants and has a direct impact on many important agronomic traits. Despite decades of research on senescence-altered mutants via forward genetics and functional assessment of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) via reverse genetics, the senescence signal and the molecular mechanism that perceives and transduces the signal remain elusive. Here, using dark-induced senescence (DIS) of <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaf as the experimental system, we show that exogenous copper induces the senescence syndrome and transcriptomic changes in light-grown plants parallel to those in DIS. By profiling the transcriptomes and tracking the subcellular copper distribution, we found that reciprocal regulation of plastocyanin, the thylakoid lumen mobile electron carrier in the Z scheme of photosynthetic electron transport, and SAG14 and plantacyanin (PCY), a pair of interacting small blue copper proteins located on the endomembrane, is a common thread in different leaf senescence scenarios, including DIS. Genetic and molecular experiments confirmed that the PCY-SAG14 module is necessary and sufficient for promoting DIS. We also found that the PCY-SAG14 module is repressed by a conserved microRNA, miR408, which in turn is repressed by phytochrome interacting factor 3/4/5 (PIF3/4/5), the key trio of transcription factors promoting DIS. Together, these findings indicate that intracellular copper redistribution mediated by PCY-SAG14 has a regulatory role in DIS. Further deciphering the copper homeostasis mechanism and its interaction with other senescence-regulating pathways should provide insights into our understanding of the fundamental question of how plants age.
