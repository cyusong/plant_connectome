In some legume-rhizobium symbioses, host specificity is influenced by rhizobial type III effectors-nodulation outer proteins (Nops). However, the genes encoding host proteins that interact with Nops remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify candidate soybean genes associated with NopD, one of the type III effectors of <i>Sinorhizobium fredii</i> HH103. The results showed that the expression pattern of NopD was analyzed in rhizobia induced by genistein. We also found NopD can be induced by TtsI, and NopD as a toxic effector can induce tobacco leaf death. In 10 soybean germplasms, NopD played a positively effect on nodule number (NN) and nodule dry weight (NDW) in nine germplasms, but not in Kenjian28. Significant phenotype of NN and NDW were identified between Dongnong594 and Charleston, Suinong14 and ZYD00006, respectively. To map the quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with NopD, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross between Dongnong594 and Charleston, and chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) derived from Suinong14 and ZYD00006 were used. Two overlapping conditional QTL associated with NopD on chromosome 19 were identified. Two candidate genes were identified in the confident region of QTL, we found that NopD could influence the expression of <i>Glyma.19g068600</i> (FBD/LRR) and expression of <i>Glyma.19g069200</i> (PP2C) after HH103 infection. Haplotype analysis showed that different types of <i>Glyma.19g069200</i> haplotypes could cause significant nodule phenotypic differences, but <i>Glyma.19g068600</i> (FBD/LRR) was not. These results suggest that NopD promotes <i>S. fredii</i> HH103 infection <i>via</i> directly or indirectly regulating <i>Glyma.19g068600</i> and <i>Glyma.19g069200</i> expression during the establishment of symbiosis between rhizobia and soybean plants.
