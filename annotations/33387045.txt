Dormancy in white-grained wheat is conditioned by the cumulative effects of several QTL that delay the onset of the capacity to germinate during ripening and after-ripening. Grain dormancy at harvest-ripeness is a major component of resistance to preharvest sprouting in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and an important trait in regions where rain is common during the harvest period. Breeding lines developed in Australia maintained their dormancy phenotype over multiple seasons and during grain ripening, the time between anthesis and the acquisition of the capacity to germinate, dormancy release, increased in line with the strength of dormancy. Genetic dissection of two dormant lines indicated that dormancy was due to the cumulative action of between one and three major genetic loci and several minor loci. This presents a significant challenge for breeders targeting environments with a high risk of sprouting where strong dormancy is desirable. Only around half of the difference in dormancy between the dormant lines and a non-dormant variety could be attributed to the major genetic loci on chromosomes 4A and 3A. A QTL that was mapped on chromosome 5A may be an orthologue of a minor QTL for dormancy in barley. At each locus, the dormancy allele increased the time to dormancy release during ripening. In combination, these alleles had cumulative effects. Embryo sensitivity to abscisic acid was related to the dormancy phenotype of the whole caryopsis, however, changes in concentrations of abscisic acid and gibberellins in embryo sections and de-embryonated grains during ripening and after-ripening could not be linked to the timing of dormancy release.
