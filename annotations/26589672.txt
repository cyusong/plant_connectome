['26589672', 'Alpha/beta hydrolase domain (ABHD)-containing proteins are structurally related  with diverse catalytic activities. In various species, some ABHD proteins have  been characterized and shown to play roles in lipid homeostasis. However, little  is known about ABHD proteins in plants. Here, we characterized AT4G10030  (AtABHD11), an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homolog of a human ABHD11 gene.  In silico analyses of AtABHD11 revealed homology with other plant species with a  conserved GXSXG lipid motif. Interestingly, Arabidopsis abhd11 mutant plants  exhibited an enhanced growth rate compared with wild-type plants. Quantitative  analyses of the total lipids showed that the mutant abhd11 has a high amount of  phospholipid and galactolipid in Arabidopsis leaves. The overexpression of  AtABHD11 in Escherichia coli led to a reduction in phospholipid levels. The  bacterially expressed recombinant AtABHD11 hydrolyzed lyso(phospho)lipid and  monoacylglycerol. Furthermore, using whole-genome microarray and real-time PCR  analyses of abhd11 and wild-type plants, we noted the up-regulation of MGD1, -2,  and -3 and DGD1. Together, these findings suggested that AtABHD11 is a  lyso(phospho)lipase. The disruption of AtABHD11 caused the accumulation of the  polar lipids in leaves, which in turn promoted a higher growth rate compared with  wild-type plants.', '2016 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.01615', 'Rajasekharan']
