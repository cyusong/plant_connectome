Arabidopsis has three cytokinin receptors genes: CRE1, AHK2, and AHK3. Availability of plants that are homozygous mutant for these three genes indicates that cytokinin receptors in the haploid cells are dispensable for the development of male and female gametophytes. The triple mutants form a few flowers but never set seed, indicating that reproductive growth is impaired. We investigated which reproductive processes are affected in the triple mutants. Anthers of mutant plants contained fewer pollen grains and did not dehisce. Pollen in the anthers completed the formation of the one vegetative nucleus and the two sperm nuclei, as seen in wild type. The majority of the ovules were abnormal: 78% lacked the embryo sac, 10% carried a female gametophyte that terminated its development before completing three rounds of nuclear division, and about 12% completed three rounds of nuclear division but the gametophytes were smaller than those of the wild type. Reciprocal crosses between the wild type and the triple mutants indicated that pollen from mutant plants did not germinate on wild-type stigmas, and wild-type pollen did not germinate on mutant stigmas. These results suggest that cytokinin receptors in the sporophyte are indispensable for anther dehiscence, pollen maturation, induction of pollen germination by the stigma, and female gametophyte formation and maturation.

CRE1: !affects! Anther dehiscence
AHK2: !affects! Pollen maturation
AHK3: !affects! Pollen germination
Wild type pollen: !does not germinate on! Mutant stigmas
Mutant pollen: !does not germinate on! Wild type stigmas
Female gametophyte: !terminates development before completing three rounds of nuclear division! in triple mutants
