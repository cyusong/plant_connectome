Drought stress has great negative effects on the plant growth and development. The tolerance of plants to such abiotic stress is triggered by complicated and multilayered signaling pathways to restore cellular homeostasis and to promote survival. The WRKY family is one of the largest transcription factor families in higher plants, and has been well recognized for the roles in regulating plants tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress. However, little is known about how the WRKY genes regulate drought resistance in cotton. In this work, we identified the WRKY transcription factor GhWRKY1-like from upland cotton as a positive regulator of tolerance to drought that directly manipulates abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis. Overexpression of GhWRKY1-like in Arabidopsis constitutively activated ABA biosynthesis genes, signaling genes, responsive genes and drought related maker genes, and led to enhanced tolerance to drought. Further analysis has shown that GhWRKY1-like can interact with "W-box" cis-elements of the promoters of AtNCED2, AtNCED5, AtNCED6 and AtNCED9 which are essential enzymes for ABA biosynthesis, and promotes the expression of those target genes. In summary, our findings suggest that GhWRKY1-like may act as a positive regulator in Arabidopsis tolerance to drought via directly interacting with the promoters of AtNCED2, AtNCED5, AtNCED6 and AtNCED9 to promote ABA biosynthesis.
