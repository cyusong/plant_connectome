['26305561', 'The Arabidopsis pollen grain is covered by a lipidic pollen coat representing  select constituents released upon the programmed cell death of the anther  secretory tapetum. These constituents originate primarily from two specialized  tapetal organelles, elaioplasts and tapetosomes. Tapetosomes are distinctive  Brassicaceae organelles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum that store  triacylglycerols, flavonoids, alkanes, and proteins. The tapetosome  triacylglycerols are found within lipid droplets surrounded by the highly  variable tapetal oleosins that eventually generate the most abundant proteins of  the pollen coat. Many questions remain regarding the sub-cellular targeting of  tapetal oleosins as well as their role in tapetosome formation. Translational  fusions of different tapetal oleosins or their derived domains to marker proteins  were introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate their localization,  processing and function. Arabidopsis tapetal oleosins were shown to be  proteolytically cleaved following tapetum degeneration and different protein  domains were targeted to the pollen coat despite vast differences in composition  and size. Importantly, specific fusions were discovered to affect distinct  aspects of tapetosome formation. This report not only highlighted the critical  role of individual tapetal oleosin domains in Arabidopsis tapetosome formation,  but revealed translational fusions to be a valuable tool in deciphering this  evidently complex developmental process.', '2016 Jan', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13611', 'Robert']
