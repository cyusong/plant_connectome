['20028838', 'Plastid-targeted proteins pass through the cytosol as unfolded precursors. If  proteins accumulate in the cytosol, they can form nonspecific aggregates that  cause severe cellular damage. Here, we demonstrate that high levels of plastid  precursors are degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in  Arabidopsis thaliana cells. The cytosolic heat shock protein cognate 70-4  (Hsc70-4) and E3 ligase carboxy terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) were  highly induced in plastid protein import2 plants, which had a T-DNA insertion at  Toc159 and showed an albino phenotype and a severe defect in protein import into  chloroplasts. Hsc70-4 and CHIP together mediated plastid precursor degradation  when import-defective chloroplast-targeted reporter proteins were transiently  expressed in protoplasts. Hsc70-4 recognized specific sequence motifs in transit  peptides and thereby led to precursor degradation through the UPS. CHIP, which  interacted with Hsc70-4, functioned as an E3 ligase in the Hsc70-4-mediated  protein degradation. The physiological role of Hsc70-4 was confirmed by analyzing  Hsc70-4 RNA interference plants in an hsc70-1 mutant background. Plants with  lower Hsc70 levels exhibited abnormal embryogenesis, resulting in defective  seedlings that displayed high levels of reactive oxygen species and  monoubiquitinated Lhcb4 precursors. We propose that Hsc70-4 and CHIP mediate  plastid-destined precursor degradation to prevent cytosolic precursor  accumulation and thereby play a critical role in embryogenesis.', '2009 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.071548', 'Hwang']
