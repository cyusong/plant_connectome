Quinoa (<i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>) is a prospective orphan crop that needs yield improvement. Previous studies indicate <i>PHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE BINDING PROTEIN</i> (<i>PEBP</i>) family genes are highly associated with the key agronomic traits of crops. Characterizing the pivotal <i>PEBP</i> genes will speed up the domestication and yield improvement of quinoa. Previous investigations on <i>PEBP</i> genes of <i>Chenopodium</i> species indicated that, the <i>PEBP</i> genes, despite in the same subclade, may have experienced functional diversification. Especially, the allotetraploidy (AABB) and numerous segmental duplications and chromosomal rearrangements in quinoa make it more difficult to understand the functions of <i>PEBP</i> genes. More recently, 6 quinoa <i>FT</i> subfamily genes were predicted to be related to flowering of quinoa. However, investigation on the whole <i>PEBP</i> family members is still lacking. In this study, we obtained 23 <i>PEBP</i> genes, including 5 <i>MFT</i>, 11 <i>FTL</i> and 7 <i>TFL</i> genes. We found 7 orthologous gene pairs, from sub-genome A and sub-genome B, respectively, showing collinearities with sugar beet. Evolution analysis on <i>PEBP</i> genes of two quinoa sub-genomes, sugar beet and relatives of diploid ancestors indicated that, the reasons for gene duplication events varied and 4 tandem duplications are the major reason for <i>PEBP</i> family expansion. Tissue-specific expression analysis suggested that expression patterns are mostly differing between orthologous gene pairs. Analysis on gene expressions at 6 stages suggested the possible positive roles of <i>CqFTL1</i>/<i>CqFTL2</i>, <i>CqFTL5</i>, <i>CqFTL8</i>, <i>CqFTL6</i>/<i>CqFTL9</i> and <i>CqTFL6</i>/<i>CqTFL7</i>, and negative roles of <i>CqTFL1</i>/<i>CqTFL2</i>/<i>CqTFL3</i>, <i>CqTFL4</i>/<i>CqTFL5</i> in inflorescence branching. Expression analysis in ABA-treated seed, in combination with the <i>cis</i>-acting element distribution analysis, indicated that <i>CqMFT2</i>, <i>CqMFT3</i> and <i>CqMFT4</i> may regulate seed germination <i>via</i> ABA signaling. Observations on responses to night break and photoperiod changes highlighted the roles of <i>CqFTL5</i> and <i>CqFTL8</i> under short day, and <i>CqFTL6</i> under long day for quinoa flowering. Further, co-expression network analysis indicated that 64 transcription factors may act upstream of <i>CqFTL5</i> and <i>CqFTL8</i> to regulate flowering. Together, this study will help us identify the pivotal <i>PEBP</i> genes that may be utilized for quinoa breeding in future.
