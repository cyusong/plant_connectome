The genetic heritage of wheat (Triticum spp.) crops has been shaped by millions of years of predomestication natural selection, often driven by competition among individuals. However, genetic improvements in yield potential are thought to involve selection towards reduced competitiveness, thus enhancing adaptation to the crop environment. We investigated potential trade-offs between individual plant fitness and community performance using a population of introgression lines carrying chromosome segments of wild emmer (nondomesticated) in the background of an elite durum cultivar. We focused on light as a primary factor affecting plant-plant interactions and assessed morphological and biomass phenotypes of single plants grown in mixtures under sunlight and a simulated canopy shade, and the relevance of these phenotypes for the monoculture community in the field. We found that responses to canopy shade resemble responses to high density and contribute to both the individual and the community. Stepwise regressions suggested that grain number per spike and its persistence under shade are essential attributes of productive communities, advocating their use as a breeding target during early-generation selection. Overall, multiple phenotypes attained under shade could better explain community performance. Our novel, applicable, high-throughput set-up provides new prospects for studying and selecting single-plant phenotypes in a canopy-like environment.
