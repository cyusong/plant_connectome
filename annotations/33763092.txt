Phospholipase C (PLC) performs significant functions in a variety of biological processes, including plant growth and development. The PLC family of enzymes principally catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipids in organisms. This exhaustive exploration of soybean GmPLC members using genome databases resulted in the identification of 15 phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC (GmPI-PLC) and 9 phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing PLC (GmNPC) genes. Chromosomal location analysis indicated that GmPLC genes mapped to 10 of the 20 soybean chromosomes. Phylogenetic relationship analysis revealed that GmPLC genes distributed into two groups in soybean, the PI-PLC and NPC groups. The expression patterns and tissue expression analysis showed that GmPLCs were differentially expressed in response to abiotic stresses. <i>GmPI-PLC7</i> was selected to further explore the role of PLC in soybean response to drought and salt stresses by a series of experiments. Compared with the transgenic empty vector (EV) control lines, over-expression of <i>GmPI-PLC7</i> (OE) conferred higher drought and salt tolerance in soybean, while the <i>GmPI-PLC7</i>-RNAi (RNAi) lines exhibited the opposite phenotypes. Plant tissue staining and physiological parameters observed from drought- and salt-stressed plants showed that stress increased the contents of chlorophyll, oxygen free radical (O<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and NADH oxidase (NOX) to amounts higher than those observed in non-stressed plants. This study provides new insights in the functional analysis of <i>GmPLC</i> genes in response to abiotic stresses.
