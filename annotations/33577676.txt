Geminiviruses can infect a wide range of plant hosts worldwide and have hence become an emerging global agroeconomic threat. The association of these viruses with satellite molecules and highly efficient insect vectors such as whiteflies further prime their devastating impacts. Plants elicit a strong antiviral immune response to restrict the invasion of these destructive pathogens. Phytohormones help plants to mount this response and occupy a key position in combating these biotrophs. These defense hormones not only inhibit geminiviral propagation but also hamper viral transmission by compromising the performance of their insect vectors. Nonetheless, geminiviruses have co-evolved to have a few multitasking virulence factors that readily remodel host cellular machineries to circumvent the phytohormone-mediated manifestation of the immune response. Furthermore, these obligate parasites exploit plant growth hormones to produce a cellular environment permissive for virus replication. In this review, we outline the current understanding of the roles and regulation of phytohormones in geminiviral pathogenesis.
