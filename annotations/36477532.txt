Recent observations suggest that the large carbon sink in mature and recovering forests may be strongly limited by nitrogen<sup>1-3</sup>. Nitrogen-fixing trees (fixers) in symbiosis with bacteria provide the main natural source of new nitrogen to tropical forests<sup>3,4</sup>. However, abundances of fixers are tightly constrained<sup>5-7</sup>, highlighting the fundamental unanswered question of what limits new nitrogen entering tropical ecosystems. Here we examine whether herbivory by animals is responsible for limiting symbiotic nitrogen fixation in tropical forests. We evaluate whether nitrogen-fixing trees experience more herbivory than other trees, whether herbivory carries a substantial carbon cost, and whether high herbivory is a result of herbivores targeting the nitrogen-rich leaves of fixers<sup>8,9</sup>. We analysed 1,626 leaves from 350 seedlings of 43 tropical tree species in Panama and found that: (1) although herbivory reduces the growth and survival of all seedlings, nitrogen-fixing trees undergo 26% more herbivory than non-fixers; (2) fixers have 34% higher carbon opportunity costs owing to herbivory than non-fixers, exceeding the metabolic cost of fixing nitrogen; and (3) the high herbivory of fixers is not driven by high leaf nitrogen. Our findings reveal that herbivory may be sufficient to limit tropical symbiotic nitrogen fixation and could constrain its role in alleviating nitrogen limitation on the tropical carbon sink.

Nitrogen-fixing trees: !experience! more herbivory 
Herbivory: !reduces growth and survival of! all seedlings 
Nitrogen-fixing trees: !have higher carbon opportunity costs! than non-fixers 
Herbivory: !exceeds metabolic cost of fixing nitrogen! 
High herbivory of fixers: !not driven by high leaf nitrogen!
