Flavonoids are secondary metabolites that play important roles in fruit and vegetable development. Here, we examined the function of hyperoside, a unique flavonoid in okra (Abelmoschus esculentus), known to promote both flowering and seed set. We showed that the exogenous application of hyperoside significantly improved pollen germination rate and pollen tube growth by almost 50%, resulting in a 42.7% increase in the seed set rate. Of several genes induced by the hyperoside treatment, AeUF3GaT1, which encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the last step of hyperoside biosynthesis, was the most strongly induced. The transcription factor AeMYB30 enhanced AeUFG3aT1 transcription by directly binding to the AeUFG3aT1 promoter. We studied the effect of the hyperoside application on the expression of 10 representative genes at four stages of reproductive development, from pollination to seed maturity. We firstly developed an efficient transformation system that uses seeds as explants to study the roles of AeMYB30 and AeUFG3aT1. Overexpression of AeMYB30 or AeUF3GaT1 promoted seed development. Moreover, exogenous application of hyperoside partially restored the aberrant phenotype of AeUF3GaT1 RNA-interference plants. Thus, hyperoside promotes seed set in okra via a pathway involving AeUF3GaT and AeMYB30, and the exogenous application of this flavonoid is a simple method that can be used to improve seed quality and yield in okra.
