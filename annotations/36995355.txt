Identification of unknown metabolites and their biosynthetic genes is an active research area in plant specialized metabolism. By following a gene-metabolite association from a genome-wide association study of Arabidopsis stem metabolites, we report a previously unknown metabolite, 2-hydroxy-2-(1-hydroxyethyl)pentanoic acid glucoside, and demonstrated that UGT76F1 is responsible for its production in Arabidopsis. The chemical structure of the glucoside was determined by a series of analyses, including tandem MS, acid and base hydrolysis, and NMR spectrometry. T-DNA knockout mutants of UGT76F1 are devoid of the glucoside but accumulate increased levels of the aglycone. 2-hydroxy-2-(1-hydroxyethyl)pentanoic acid is structurally related to the C7-necic acid component of lycopsamine-type pyrrolizidine alkaloids such as trachelantic acid and viridifloric acid. Feeding norvaline greatly enhances the accumulation of 2-hydroxy-2-(1-hydroxyethyl)pentanoic acid glucoside in wild-type but not the UGT76F1 knockout mutant plants, providing evidence for an orthologous C7-necic acid biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis despite the apparent lack of pyrrolizidine alkaloids.
