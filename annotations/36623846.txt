Petal senescence is controlled by a complex regulatory network. Epigenetic regulation like histone modification influences chromatin state and gene expression. However, the involvement of histone methylation in regulating petal senescence remains poorly understood. Here, we found that the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is increased during ethylene-induced petal senescence in carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.). H3K4me3 levels were positively associated with the expression of transcription factor DcWRKY75, ethylene biosynthetic genes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (DcACS1) and ACC oxidase (DcACO1), and senescence associated genes (SAGs) DcSAG12 and DcSAG29. Further, we identified that carnation ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG OF TRITHORAX1 (DcATX1) encodes a histone lysine methyltransferase which can methylate H3K4. Knockdown of DcATX1 delayed ethylene induced petal senescence in carnation, which was associated with the downregulated expression of DcWRKY75, DcACO1 and DcSAG12, whereas overexpression of DcATX1 exhibited the opposite effects. DcATX1 promoted the transcription of DcWRKY75, DcACO1 and DcSAG12 by elevating the H3K4me3 levels within their promoters. Overall, our results demonstrate that DcATX1 is a H3K4 methyltransferase that promotes the expression of DcWRKY75, DcACO1, DcSAG12 and potentially other downstream target genes by regulating H3K4me3 levels, thereby accelerating ethylene induced petal senescence in carnation. This study further indicates that epigenetic regulation is important for plant senescence processes.
