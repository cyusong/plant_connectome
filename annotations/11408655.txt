['11408655', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) promotes plant water conservation by  decreasing the apertures of stomatal pores in the epidermis through which water  loss occurs. We found that Arabidopsis thaliana plants harboring transferred DNA  insertional mutations in the sole prototypical heterotrimeric GTP-binding (G)  protein alpha subunit gene, GPA1, lack both ABA inhibition of guard cell inward  K(+) channels and pH-independent ABA activation of anion channels. Stomatal  opening in gpa1 plants is insensitive to inhibition by ABA, and the rate of water  loss from gpa1 mutants is greater than that from wild-type plants. Manipulation  of G protein status in guard cells may provide a mechanism for controlling plant  water balance.', '2001 Jun 15', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1059046', 'Assmann']
