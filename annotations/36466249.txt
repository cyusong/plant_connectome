Plant bacterial disease is a complex outcome achieved through a combination of virulence factors that are activated during infection. However, the common virulence factors across diverse plant pathogens are largely uncharacterized. Here, we established a pan-genome shared across the following plant pathogens: <i>Burkholderia glumae</i>, <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i>, and <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i>. By overlaying <i>in planta</i> transcriptomes onto the pan-genome, we investigated the expression profiles of common genes during infection. We found over 70% of identical patterns for genes commonly expressed by the pathogens in different plant hosts or infection sites. Co-expression patterns revealed the activation of a signal transduction cascade to recognize and respond to external changes within hosts. Using mutagenesis, we uncovered a relationship between bacterial virulence and functions highly conserved and shared in the studied genomes of the bacterial phytopathogens, including flagellar biosynthesis protein, C4-dicarboxylate ABC transporter, 2-methylisocitrate lyase, and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (PCD). In particular, the disruption of PCD gene led to attenuated virulence in all pathogens and significantly affected phytotoxin production in <i>B. glumae</i>. This PCD gene was ubiquitously distributed in most plant pathogens with high homology. In conclusion, our results provide cross-species <i>in planta</i> models for identifying common virulence factors, which can be useful for the protection of crops against diverse pathogens.
