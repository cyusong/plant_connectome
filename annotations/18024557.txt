We investigated the functional and biochemical variability of Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (KTI) genes of Populus trichocarpa x Populus deltoides. Phylogenetic analysis, expressed sequence tag databases, and western-blot analysis confirmed that these genes belong to a large and diverse gene family with complex expression patterns. Five wound- and herbivore-induced genes representing the diversity of the KTI gene family were selected for functional analysis and shown to produce active KTI proteins in Escherichia coli. These recombinant KTI proteins were all biochemically distinct and showed clear differences in efficacy against trypsin-, chymotrypsin-, and elastase-type proteases, suggesting functional specialization of different members of this gene family. The in vitro stability of the KTIs in the presence of reducing agents and elevated temperature also varied widely, emphasizing the biochemical differences of these proteins. Significantly, the properties of the recombinant KTI proteins were not predictable from primary amino acid sequence data. Proteases in midgut extracts of Malacosoma disstria, a lepidopteran pest of Populus, were strongly inhibited by at least two of the KTI gene products. This study suggests that the large diversity in the poplar (Populus spp.) KTI family is important for biochemical and functional specialization, which may be important in the maintenance of pest resistance in long-lived plants such as poplar.
