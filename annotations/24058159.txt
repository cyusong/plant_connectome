['24058159', 'Histone deacetylation regulates gene expression during plant stress responses and  is therefore an interesting target for epigenetic manipulation of stress  sensitivity in plants. Unfortunately, overexpression of the core enzymes (histone  deacetylases [HDACs]) has either been ineffective or has caused pleiotropic  morphological abnormalities. In yeast and mammals, HDACs operate within  multiprotein complexes. Searching for putative components of plant HDAC  complexes, we identified a gene with partial homology to a functionally  uncharacterized member of the yeast complex, which we called Histone  Deacetylation Complex1 (HDC1). HDC1 is encoded by a single-copy gene in the  genomes of model plants and crops and therefore presents an attractive target for  biotechnology. Here, we present a functional characterization of HDC1 in  Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that HDC1 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear  protein that interacts with at least two deacetylases (HDA6 and HDA19), promotes  histone deacetylation, and attenuates derepression of genes under water stress.  The fast-growing HDC1-overexpressing plants outperformed wild-type plants not  only on well-watered soil but also when water supply was reduced. Our findings  identify HDC1 as a rate-limiting component of the histone deacetylation machinery  and as an attractive tool for increasing germination rate and biomass production  of plants.', '2013 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.114835', 'Amtmann']
