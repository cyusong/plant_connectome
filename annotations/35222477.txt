Lipid remodeling of Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors is required for their maturation and may influence the localization and function of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). Maturation of GPI-anchors is well characterized in animals and fungi but very little is known about this process in plants. In yeast, the GPI-lipid remodeling occurs entirely at the ER and is initiated by the remodeling enzyme Bst1p (Post-Glycosylphosphatidylinositol Attachment to Proteins inositol deacylase 1 -PGAP1- in mammals and <i>Arabidopsis</i>). Next, the remodeling enzyme Per1p (Post-Glycosylphosphatidylinositol Attachment to Proteins phospholipase 3 -PGAP3- in mammals) removes a short, unsaturated fatty acid of phosphatidylinositol (PI) that is replaced with a very long-chain saturated fatty acid or ceramide to complete lipid remodeling. In mammals, lipid remodeling starts at the ER and is completed at the Golgi apparatus. Studies of the <i>Arabidopsis PGAP1</i> gene showed that the lipid remodeling of the GPI anchor is critical for the final localization of GPI-APs. Here we characterized loss-of-function mutants of <i>Arabidopsis Per1</i>/<i>PGAP3</i> like genes (<i>AtPGAP3A</i> and <i>AtPGAP3B</i>). Our results suggest that <i>PGAP3A</i> function is required for the efficient transport of GPI-anchored proteins from the ER to the plasma membrane/cell wall. In addition, loss of function of <i>PGAP3A</i> increases susceptibility to salt and osmotic stresses that may be due to the altered localization of GPI-APs in this mutant. Furthermore, <i>PGAP3B</i> complements a yeast strain lacking <i>PER1</i> gene suggesting that PGAP3B and Per1p are functional orthologs. Finally, subcellular localization studies suggest that PGAP3A and PGAP3B cycle between the ER and the Golgi apparatus.
