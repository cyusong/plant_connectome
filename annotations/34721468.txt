Soil salinity is one of the major factors that limit the area of cultivable land and yield potential of crops. The ability of salt tolerance varies with plant species. Peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.) is a moderately salt-sensitive and economically important crop, however, their biological processes involved in salt-stress response remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of <i>A. hypogaea</i> L. ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 4s (<i>AhABI4s</i>) in salt tolerance and elucidated its mode of action in peanuts. The results showed that the downregulation of <i>AhABI4</i>s <i>via</i> whole plant virus-induced gene silencing has enhanced the survival rate, biomass accumulation, and root/shoot ratio of peanut seedlings in response to salt-stress. Transcriptomics, quantitative proteomics, and phosphoproteomic analyses were performed using <i>AhABI4</i>s-silenced and Mock plants. The expression pattern of 15,247 genes, 1,900 proteins, and 2,620 phosphorylation sites were affected by silencing of <i>AhABI4</i>s in peanut leaf and root after sodium chloride (NaCl) treatment. Among them, 63 potential downstream target genes of ABI4 changed consistently at both transcription and translation levels, and the protein/phosphorylation levels of 31 ion transporters/channels were also affected. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed that ABI4 was able to bind to the promoters of <i>HSP70, fructokinase</i> (<i>FRK</i>), and <i>pyruvate kinase</i> (<i>PK</i>) coding genes <i>in vitro</i>. In addition, we also detected a binding preference of <i>AhABI4</i> for CACT(G/T)GCA motif in the promoters of down-regulated genes in peanut leaf. Collectively, the potential downstream targets which were regulated at the levels of transcription and translation, binding preference, and <i>in vivo</i> phosphorylation sites that had been revealed in this study will provide new insight into the <i>AhABI4s</i>-mediated salt tolerance regulation mechanism in peanuts.
