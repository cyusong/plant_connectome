['16169895', 'The 26S proteasome plays a central role in the degradation of regulatory proteins  involved in a variety of developmental processes. It consists of two multisubunit  protein complexes: the proteolytic core protease and the regulatory particle  (RP). The function of most RP subunits is poorly understood. Here, we describe  mutants in the Arabidopsis thaliana RPN1 subunit, which is encoded by two  paralogous genes, RPN1a and RPN1b. Disruption of RPN1a caused embryo lethality,  while RPN1b mutants showed no obvious abnormal phenotype. Embryos homozygous for  rpn1a arrested at the globular stage with defects in the formation of the  embryonic root, the protoderm, and procambium. Cyclin B1 protein was not degraded  in these embryos, consistent with cell division defects. Double mutant plants  (rpn1a/RPN1a rpn1b/rpn1b) produced embryos with a phenotype indistinguishable  from that of the rpn1a single mutant. Thus, despite their largely overlapping  expression patterns in flowers and developing seeds, the two isoforms do not  share redundant functions during gametogenesis and embryogenesis. However,  complementation of the rpn1a mutation with the coding region of RPN1b expressed  under the control of the RPN1a promoter indicates that the two RPN1 isoforms are  functionally equivalent. Overall, our data indicate that RPN1 activity is  essential during embryogenesis, where it might participate in the destruction of  a specific set of protein substrates.', '2005 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.034975', 'Grossniklaus']
