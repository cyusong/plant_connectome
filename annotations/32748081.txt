We have developed multiplex genome editing toolkits for citrus that significantly improve citrus genome editing efficacy. CRISPR/Cas systems have been engineered for genome editing in many organisms, including plants. However, the gene editing efficiency in citrus via CRISPR technology remains too low to be implemented for genetic improvement in practice. Moreover, it is very difficult to obtain homozygous or biallelic knockout mutants in citrus. Here, we have developed multiplex genome editing toolkits for citrus including PEG-mediated protoplast transformation, a GFP reporter system that allows the rapid assessment of CRISPR constructs, citrus U6 promoters with improved efficacy, and tRNA-mediated or Csy4-mediated multiplex genome editing. Using the toolkits, we successfully conducted genome modification of embryogenic protoplast cells and epicotyl tissues. We have achieved a biallelic mutation rate of 44.4% and a homozygous mutation rate of 11.1%, representing a significant improvement in citrus genome editing efficacy. In addition, our study lays the foundation for nontransgenic genome editing of citrus.
