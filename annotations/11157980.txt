['11157980', "KEULE is required for cytokinesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. We have positionally  cloned the KEULE gene and shown that it encodes a Sec1 protein. KEULE is  expressed throughout the plant, yet appears enriched in dividing tissues.  Cytokinesis-defective mutant sectors were observed in all somatic tissues upon  transformation of wild-type plants with a KEULE-green fluorescent protein gene  fusion, suggesting that KEULE is required not only during embryogenesis, but at  all stages of the plant's life cycle. KEULE is characteristic of a Sec1 protein  in that it appears to exist in two forms: soluble or peripherally associated with  membranes. More importantly, KEULE binds the cytokinesis-specific syntaxin  KNOLLE. Sec1 proteins are key regulators of vesicle trafficking, capable of  integrating a large number of intra- and/or intercellular signals. As a  cytokinesis-related Sec1 protein, KEULE appears to represent a novel link between  cell cycle progression and the membrane fusion apparatus.", '2001 Feb 5', 'J Cell Biol', '10.1083/jcb.152.3.531', 'Jurgens']
