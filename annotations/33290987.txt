Protein assemblages in the plasma membrane of photosynthetic organisms include the polar occurrence of PIN proteins permitting polar auxin transport in embryophytes and Charales, and the H<sup>+</sup> ATPase in acid zones of Charales cells. Production of small radius of curvature membrane areas in transfer cells and charasomes is incompletely understood.
