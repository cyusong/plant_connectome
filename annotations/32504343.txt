Tissue-specific occurrence and formation of endogenous sesquiterpene lactones has been assessed and suggests physiological function as antagonists of auxin-induced plant growth in sunflower. Sunflower, Helianthus annuus, accumulate high concentrations of bioactive sesquiterpene lactones (STL) in glandular trichomes, but in addition, structurally different STL occur in only trace amounts in the inner tissues. The spatial and temporal production of these endogenous STL during early phases of plant development is widely unknown and their physiological function as putative natural growth regulators is yet speculative. By means of HPLC and MS analysis it was shown that costunolide, dehydrocostuslactone, 8-epixanthatin and tomentosin are already present in dry seeds and can be extracted in low amounts from cotyledons, hypocotyls and roots of seedlings during the first days after germination. Semi-quantitative and RT-qPCR experiments with genes of the key enzymes of two independent routes of the endogenous STL biosynthesis confirmed the early and individual expression in these organs and revealed a gradual down regulation during the first 72-96 h after germination. Light irradiation of the plants led to a fast, but transient increase of STL in parts of the hypocotyl which correlated with growth retardation of the stem. One-sided external application of costunolide on hypocotyls conferred reduced growth of the treated side, thus resulting in the curving of the stem towards the side of the application. This indicates the inhibiting effects of STL on plant growth. The putative function of endogenous STL in sunflower as antagonists of auxin in growth processes is discussed.
