['25303364', 'The presumed totipotency of plant cells leads to questions about how specific  stem cell lineages and terminal fates could be established. In the Arabidopsis  stomatal lineage, a transient self-renewing phase creates precursors that  differentiate into one of two epidermal cell types, guard cells or pavement  cells. We found that irreversible differentiation of guard cells involves  RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) recruitment to regulatory regions of master  regulators of stomatal initiation, facilitated through interaction with a  terminal stomatal lineage transcription factor, FAMA. Disrupting physical  interactions between FAMA and RBR preferentially reveals the role of RBR in  enforcing fate commitment over its role in cell-cycle control in this  developmental context. Analysis of the phenotypes linked to the modulation of  FAMA and RBR sheds new light on the way iterative divisions and terminal  differentiation are coordinately regulated in a plant stem-cell lineage.', '2014 Oct 10', 'Elife', '10.7554/eLife.03271', 'Bergmann']
