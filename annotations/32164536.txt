Powdery mildew (PM) is an important disease of pea that reduce yield. Ascophyllum nodosum extract (ANE) and chitosan (CHT) are biostimulants used to improve plant health. Efficacy of ANE and CHT was assessed individually and in combination against pea powdery mildew. Combined applications of ANE and CHT had a significant inhibitory effect on pathogen development and it reduced disease severity to 35%, as compared to control (90.5%). The combination of ANE and CHT enhanced the activity of plant defense enzymes; phenylalanine ammonia lyases (PAL), peroxidase (PO) and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Further, the treatment increased the expression of a number of plant defense genes in jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway such as LOX1 and COI and salicylic acid (SA)-mediated signaling pathway such as NPR1 and PR1. Other genes involved in defense mechanisms like NADPH oxidase and C4H were also upregulated by the combination treatment. The combination of ANE and CHT suppresses pea powdery mildew largely by modulating JA and SA-mediated signaling pathways.
