Heat shock proteins 90 (Hsp90s) are conserved proteins participating in the responses to heat stress and are found to be involved in different kinds of abiotic and biotic stresses. <i>Brassica napus</i> (<i>B. napus</i>) is an important heteropolyploid crop, producing edible oil. Salt stress is one of the most important hazards to the growth of rape in the world, while Sclerotinia stem rot is one of the most serious diseases, caused by <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> (<i>S. sclerotiorum</i>). In this study, the evolution of <i>Hsp90</i> genes and their responses to these two stresses were elucidated. Bioinformatic analysis through the whole genome of <i>B. napus</i> identified 35 <i>Hsp90</i> gene family members. Five groups were obtained <i>via</i> phylogenetic analysis with the 35 <i>Hsp</i> genes, <i>Hsps</i> from its two ancestor species <i>Brassica rapa</i>, <i>Brassica oleracea</i>, and <i>AtHsps</i>. Gene structure and conservative motif analysis of these 35 <i>Hsps</i> indicated that the <i>Hsps</i> were relatively conservative in each group. Strong collinearity was also detected between the genomes of <i>Brassica rapa</i>, <i>Brassica oleracea</i> and <i>B. napus</i>, along with identifying syntenic gene pairs of <i>Hsps</i> among the three genomes. In addition, whole genome duplication was discovered as the main reason for the generation of <i>BnHsp</i> gene family. The analysis of cis-acting elements indicated that <i>BnHsp90</i> might be involved in a variety of abiotic and biotic stress responses. Analysis of the expression pattern indicated that <i>BnHsp90</i> participates in the responses of <i>B. napus</i> to salt stress and the infection of <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>. Fourteen and nine <i>BnHsp90s</i> were validated to be involved in the defense responses of <i>B. napus</i> against salt stress and <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>, respectively. Our results provide new insights for the roles of <i>BnHsp90s</i> in the responses of <i>B. napus</i> to salt stress and <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>.
