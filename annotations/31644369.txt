The first layer of plant immunity is deployed by recognition of pathogen-associated molecule patterns (PAMPs) and induction of early stress responses. Flagellin is the major protein component of the flagellum. Flagellin-derived peptide fragments such as Flg22, a short active peptide derived from the highly conserved part of the N-terminal region, are recognized as PAMPs by a specific perception system present in most higher plants. Some bacteria evade the plant recognition system by altering the Flg22 region in the flagellin. Instead, a small subset of plants (i.e., solanaceous plants) can sense these bacteria by recognizing a second region, termed FlgII-28. The function of FlgII-28 has been well-documented in tomato but not in potato plants. Here, we investigated the effect of FlgII-28 on several defense responses in potato. Cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) elevation is an early defense response upon pathogenic infection. We generated transgenic potato plants expressing aequorin, a nontoxic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated photoprotein. The results showed that FlgII-28 induced strong cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the response was attenuated when a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker was added. In addition, the FlgII-28-triggered cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation was shown to subsequently promote extracellular alkalinization, reactive oxygen species production, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and transcriptional reprogramming of defense-related genes in potato. Interestingly, all tested defense responses caused by FlgII-28 were significantly stronger than those caused by Flg22, suggesting that FlgII-28 acts as a primary flagellar PAMP to elicit multiple defense responses in potato.
