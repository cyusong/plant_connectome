NO has an important role in the control of plant development, growth, and the response to abiotic stress. In our recent paper it was demonstrated that NO affected the salt-induced changes in free amino acid levels in maize. (1) Since polyamines are synthesized from lysine and arginine, it was supposed that their concentrations are also influenced by NO. Cadaverine levels were increased by a NO donor and decreased by an inhibitor of NO synthesis in salt-stressed maize. These findings indicate that NO participates in the mediation of the effect of salt on cadaverine content. The coordinated changes in the NO and cadaverine levels may be involved in regulating of the response to salt stress in maize.

NO: !affects! Salt-induced changes in free amino acid levels
NO: !increases! Cadaverine levels
NO: !decreases! Cadaverine levels
NO: !mediates! Effect of salt on cadaverine content
NO: !regulates! Response to salt stress
