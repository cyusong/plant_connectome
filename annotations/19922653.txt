['19922653', 'BACKGROUND: Tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs) are widely used as markers for  vacuolar compartments in higher plants. Ten TIP isoforms are encoded by the  Arabidopsis genome. For several isoforms, the tissue and cell specific pattern of  expression are not known. RESULTS: We generated fluorescent protein fusions to  the genomic sequences of all members of the Arabidopsis TIP family whose  expression is predicted to occur in root tissues (TIP1;1 and 1;2; TIP2;1, 2;2 and  2;3; TIP4;1) and expressed these fusions, both individually and in selected  pairwise combinations, in transgenic Arabidopsis. Analysis by confocal microscopy  revealed that TIP distribution varied between different cell layers within the  root axis, with extensive co-expression of some TIPs and more restricted  expression patterns for other isoforms. TIP isoforms whose expression overlapped  appeared to localise to the tonoplast of the central vacuole, vacuolar bulbs and  smaller, uncharacterised structures. CONCLUSION: We have produced a comprehensive  atlas of TIP expression in Arabidopsis roots, which reveals novel expression  patterns for not previously studied TIPs.', '2009 Nov 18', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-9-133', 'Frigerio']
