['18252706', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana AtHMA1 protein is a member of the P(IB)-ATPase family,  which is implicated in heavy metal transport. However, sequence analysis reveals  that AtHMA1 possesses a predicted stalk segment present in SERCA  (sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase)-type pumps that is involved in  inhibition by thapsigargin. To analyze the ion specificity of AtHMA1, we  performed functional complementation assays using mutant yeast strains defective  in Ca(2+) homeostasis or heavy metal transport. The heterologous expression of  AtHMA1 complemented the phenotype of both types of mutants and, interestingly,  increased heavy metal tolerance of wild-type yeast. Biochemical analyses were  performed to describe the activity of AtHMA1 in microsomal fractions isolated  from complemented yeast. Zinc, copper, cadmium, and cobalt activate the ATPase  activity of AtHMA1, which corroborates the results of metal tolerance assays. The  outcome establishes the role of AtHMA1 in Cd(2+) detoxification in yeast and  suggests that this pump is able to transport other heavy metals ions. Further  analyses were performed to typify the active Ca(2+) transport mediated by AtHMA1.  Ca(2+) transport displayed high affinity with an apparent K(m) of 370 nm and a  V(max) of 1.53 nmol mg(-1) min(-1). This activity was strongly inhibited by  thapsigargin (IC(50) = 16.74 nm), demonstrating the functionality of its  SERCA-like stalk segment. In summary, these results demonstrate that AtHMA1  functions as a Ca(2+)/heavy metal pump. This protein is the first described plant  P-type pump specifically inhibited by thapsigargin.', '2008 Apr 11', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M800736200', 'Ordenes']
