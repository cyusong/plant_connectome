This paper investigates the dependence of monoterpene emissions at the canopy scale on total leaf area and leaf distribution. Simulations were carried out for a range of hypothetical but realistic forest canopies of the evergreen Quercus ilex (holm oak). Two emission models were applied that either did (SIM-BIM2) or did not (G93) account for cumulative responses to temperature and light. Both were embedded into a canopy model that considered spatial and temporal variations of foliage properties. This canopy model was coupled to a canopy climate model (CANOAK) to determine the micrometeorological conditions at the leaf scale. Structural properties considerably impacted monoterpene emission. The sensitivities to changes in total leaf area and to leaf area distribution were found to be of similar magnitude. The two different models performed similarly on a whole-year basis but showed clear differences during certain episodes. The analysis showed that structural indices have to be carefully evaluated for proper scaling of emission from leaves to canopy. Further research is encouraged on seasonal dynamics of emission potentials.
