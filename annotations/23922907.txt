['23922907', 'Plant-specific PIN-formed (PIN) efflux transporters for the plant hormone auxin  are required for tissue-specific directional auxin transport and cellular auxin  homeostasis. The Arabidopsis PIN protein family has been shown to play important  roles in developmental processes such as embryogenesis, organogenesis, vascular  tissue differentiation, root meristem patterning and tropic growth. Here we  analyzed roles of the less characterised Arabidopsis PIN6 auxin transporter. PIN6  is auxin-inducible and is expressed during multiple auxin-regulated developmental  processes. Loss of pin6 function interfered with primary root growth and lateral  root development. Misexpression of PIN6 affected auxin transport and interfered  with auxin homeostasis in other growth processes such as shoot apical dominance,  lateral root primordia development, adventitious root formation, root hair  outgrowth and root waving. These changes in auxin-regulated growth correlated  with a reduction in total auxin transport as well as with an altered activity of  DR5-GUS auxin response reporter. Overall, the data indicate that PIN6 regulates  auxin homeostasis during plant development.', '2013', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0070069', 'Pogson']
