Light signals mediate a number of physiological and developmental processes in plants, such as flowering, photomorphogenesis, and pigment accumulation. Emerging evidence has revealed that a group of B-box proteins (BBXs) function as central players in these light-mediated developmental processes. B-box proteins are a class of zinc-coordinated transcription factors or regulators that not only directly mediate the transcription of target genes but also interact with various other factors to create a complex regulatory network involved in the precise control of plant growth and development. This review summarizes and highlights the recent findings concerning the critical regulatory functions of BBXs in photoperiodic flowering, light signal transduction and light-induced pigment accumulation and their molecular modes of action at the transcriptional and post-translational levels in plants.
