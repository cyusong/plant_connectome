Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is an essential substrate for photosynthesis in plants. CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed mainly through the stomata in land plants because all other aerial surfaces are covered by a waxy layer called the cuticle. The cuticle is an important barrier that protects against extreme water loss; however, this anaerobic layer limits CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. Simply, in the process of adapting to a terrestrial environment, plants have acquired drought tolerance in exchange for reduced CO<sub>2</sub> uptake efficiency. To evaluate the extent to which increased cuticle permeability enhances CO<sub>2</sub> uptake efficiency, we investigated the CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate, carbon content, and dry weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutant <i>excessive transpiration1</i> (<i>extra1</i>), whose cuticle is remarkably permeable to water vapor. We isolated the mutant as a new allele of <i>ACETYL</i>-<i>COA CARBOXYLASE1</i>, encoding a critical enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, thereby affecting cuticle wax synthesis. Under saturated water vapor conditions, the <i>extra1</i> mutant demonstrated a higher CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate, carbon content, and greater dry weight than did the wild-type plant. On the other hand, the stomatal mutant <i>slow</i>-<i>type anion channel</i>-<i>associated1</i>, whose stomata are continuously open, also exhibited a higher CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate than the wild-type plant; however, the increase was only half of the amount exhibited by <i>extra1</i> These results indicate that the efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake via a permeable cuticle is greater than the efficiency via stomata and confirm that land plants suffer a greater loss of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake efficiency by developing a cuticle barrier.
