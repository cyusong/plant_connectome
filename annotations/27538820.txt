The induced production of secondary metabolites in herbivore-attacked plants varies in space and time. However, the consequences of these spatiotemporal patterns for herbivore performance are not well understood. This is particularly true for 1,4-benzoxazin-3-ones (BXs), the major induced defensive metabolites of maize. Here we report on the spatiotemporal dynamics of BX induction and its consequences for the leaf feeder Spodoptera littoralis. Defence-related phytohormones and transcript levels of BX biosynthetic genes were upregulated locally at the wound site within 12 h of herbivory. Within another 12 h, the insecticidal BX HDMBOA-Glc started to accumulate in a highly localized manner at the feeding site. Changes in BX metabolism away from the feeding site within the same leaf were much weaker and were undetected in systemic leaves. Following the removal of the caterpillars, local HDMBOA-Glc levels remained elevated for 7 days. Caterpillars that were forced to feed directly on locally induced leaf parts, but not on adjacent leaf parts, suffered from reduced growth. This effect was abolished in the BX-deficient bx1 mutant. We did not find any evidence that BXs regulate defensive phytohormones or their own accumulation. In summary, this study shows that induced herbivore resistance in maize is highly localized and dependent on BXs.
