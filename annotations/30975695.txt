In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the abscission of floral organs is regulated by two related receptor-like protein kinases, HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-LIKE2 (HSL2). In complex with members of the SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) family of coreceptor protein kinases, HAE and HSL2 are activated when bound by INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSICSSION, a proteolytically processed peptide ligand, activating the expression of genes encoding secreted cell wall remodeling and hydrolase enzymes. <i>hae hsl2</i> mutants fail to induce expression of these genes and retain floral organs indefinitely. Here, we report identification of an allelic series of <i>hae hsl2</i> suppressor mutations in the <i>SERK1</i> coreceptor protein kinase gene. Genetic and transcriptomic evidence indicates that these alleles represent a novel class of gain-of-function mutations that activate signaling independently of HAE/HSL2. We show that, surprisingly, the suppression effect does not rely on the protein kinase activity of SERK1 and that activation of signaling relies on the receptor-like kinase gene <i>SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1</i> (<i>SOBIR1</i>). The effect of these mutations can be mimicked by loss of function of <i>BAK1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> (<i>BIR1</i>), a known negative regulator of <i>SERK</i>-<i>SOBIR1</i> signaling. These results suggest that <i>BIR1</i> negatively regulates <i>SERK-SOBIR1</i> signaling during abscission and that the identified <i>SERK1</i> mutations likely interfere with this negative regulation.
