Considerable signal crosstalk exists in the regulatory network of senescence and stress response. Numerous senescence-associated genes are also involved in plant stress tolerance. However, the underlying mechanisms and application potential of these genes in stress-tolerant crop breeding remain poorly explored. We found that overexpression of SENESCENCE-SUPPRESSED PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE (SSPP), a negative regulator of leaf senescence, significantly improved plant salt tolerance by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging in both Arabidopsis and soybean. However, overexpression of SSPP severely suppressed normal plant growth, limiting its direct use in agriculture. We previously revealed that the N-terminal 1-14 residues of ACS7 (termed 'N<sup>7</sup> ') negatively regulated its protein stability through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, and the N<sup>7</sup> -mediated protein degradation was suppressed by environmental and senescence signals. To avoid the adverse effects of SSPP, the N<sup>7</sup> element was fused to the N-terminus of SSPP. We demonstrated that N<sup>7</sup> -SSPP fusion gene effectively rescued SSPP-induced growth suppression but maintained enhanced salt tolerance in Arabidopsis and soybean. Particularly, N<sup>7</sup> -SSPP enhanced tolerance to long-term salt stress and increased seed yield in soybean. These results suggest that N<sup>7</sup> -SSPP overcomes the disadvantages of SSPP on plant growth inhibition and effectively improves salt tolerance through enhanced ROS scavenging, providing an effective strategy of using posttranslational regulatory element for salt-tolerant crop breeding.
