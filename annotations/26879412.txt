Plants are constantly threatened by potential pathogens. In order to optimize the output of defense against pathogens with distinct lifestyles, plants depend on hormonal networks to fine-tune specific responses and regulate growth-defense tradeoffs. To counteract, pathogens have evolved various strategies to disturb hormonal homeostasis and facilitate infection. Many pathogens synthesize plant hormones; more importantly, toxins and effectors are produced to manipulate hormonal crosstalk. Accumulating evidence has shown that pathogens exert extensive effects on plant hormone pathways not only to defeat immunity, but also modify habitat structure, optimize nutrient acquisition, and facilitate pathogen dissemination. In this review, we summarize mechanisms by which a wide array of pathogens gain benefits from manipulating plant hormone pathways.

Pathogen: !synthesizes! Plant Hormone 
Pathogen: !produces! Toxins/Effectors 
Toxins/Effectors: !manipulate! Hormonal Crosstalk 
Pathogen: !defeats! Immunity 
Pathogen: !modifies! Habitat Structure 
Pathogen: !optimizes! Nutrient Acquisition 
Pathogen: !facilitates! Pathogen Dissemination
