Nitric oxide (NO) is widely recognized for its role as a signaling molecule in regulating plant developmental processes. We summarize recent work on NO generation via nitrate reductase (NR) or/and NO synthase (NOS) pathway in response to nutrient fluctuation and its regulation of plant root growth and N metabolism. The promotion or inhibition of root development most likely depends on NO concentrations and/or experimental conditions. NO plays an important role in regulating plant NR activity at posttranslational level probably via a direct interaction mechanism, thus contributing largely to N assimilation. NO also regulates N distribution and uptake in many plant species. In rice cultivar, NR-generated NO plays a pivotal role in improving N uptake capacity by increasing root growth and inorganic N uptake, representing a potential strategy for rice adaption to a fluctuating nitrate supply.
