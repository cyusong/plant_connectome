An ability to form symbiotic associations with rhizobia and to utilize atmospheric nitrogen makes legumes ecologically successful. High iron content in legume grains, partially relocated from root nodules, is another-nutritional-advantage of this group of plants. The ferritin complex is the major cell iron storage and detoxification unit and has been recognized as a marker of many stress-induced responses. The possible participation of ferritin in nodule formation and functioning was investigated here. Correlation of increased accumulation of both ferritin polypeptide and mRNA with actual in situ localization of ferritin allowed ferritin synthesis in the developing, indeterminate-type root nodules to be related to differentiating bacteroid tissue. This kind of tissue, in contrast to the determinate-type nodules, is present in lupin nodules at almost all stages of their development. Interestingly, it was found that, in this type of nodule, senescence starting in the decaying zones induces ferritin accumulation in younger, still active, tissues. Based on the presented data, and in correlation with previous results, some aspects of the regulation of expression of lupin ferritin genes are also discussed.
