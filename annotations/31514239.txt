Globally, spring phenology and abiotic processes are shifting earlier with warming. Differences in the magnitudes of these shifts may decouple the timing of plant resource requirements from resource availability. In riparian forests across the northern hemisphere, warming could decouple seed release from snowmelt peak streamflow, thus reducing moisture and safe sites for dominant tree recruitment. We combined field observations with climate, hydrology, and phenology models to simulate future change in synchrony of seed release and snowmelt peaks in the South Platte River Basin, Colorado, for three Salicaceae species that dominate western USA riparian forests. Chilling requirements for overcoming winter endodormancy were strongest in Salix exigua, moderately supported for Populus deltoides, and indiscernible in Salix amygdaloides. Ensemble mean projected warming of 3.5°C shifted snowmelt peaks 10-19 d earlier relative to S. exigua and P. deltoides seed release, because decreased winter chilling combined with increased spring forcing limited change in their phenology. By contrast, warming shifted both snowmelt peaks and S. amygdaloides seed release 21 d earlier, maintaining their synchrony. Decoupling of snowmelt from seed release for Salicaceae with strong chilling requirements is likely to reduce resources critical for recruitment of these foundational riparian forests, although the magnitude of future decoupling remains uncertain.
