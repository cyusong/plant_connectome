['22227893', 'Plants have evolved a variety of mechanisms to adapt to N starvation. NITRATE  TRANSPORTER2.4 (NRT2.4) is one of seven NRT2 family genes in Arabidopsis  thaliana, and NRT2.4 expression is induced under N starvation. Green fluorescent  protein and beta-glucuronidase reporter analyses revealed that NRT2.4 is a plasma  membrane transporter expressed in the epidermis of lateral roots and in or close  to the shoot phloem. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of NRT2.4 in roots is  complementary with that of the major high-affinity nitrate transporter NTR2.1.  Functional analysis in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in planta showed that NRT2.4 is  a nitrate transporter functioning in the high-affinity range. In N-starved nrt2.4  mutants, nitrate uptake under low external supply and nitrate content in shoot  phloem exudates was decreased. In the absence of NRT2.1 and NRT2.2, loss of  function of NRT2.4 (triple mutants) has an impact on biomass production under low  nitrate supply. Together, our results demonstrate that NRT2.4 is a nitrate  transporter that has a role in both roots and shoots under N starvation.', '2012 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.092221', 'Krapp']
