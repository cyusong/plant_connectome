Stomata regulate gas exchange between plants and atmosphere by integrating opening and closing signals. Stomata open in response to low CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to maximize photosynthesis in the light; however, the mechanisms that coordinate photosynthesis and stomatal conductance have yet to be identified. Here we identify and characterize CBC1/2 (CONVERGENCE OF BLUE LIGHT (BL) AND CO<sub>2</sub> 1/2), two kinases that link BL, a major component of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and the signals from low concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in guard cells. CBC1/CBC2 redundantly stimulate stomatal opening by inhibition of S-type anion channels in response to both BL and low concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>. CBC1/CBC2 function in the signaling pathways of phototropins and HT1 (HIGH LEAF TEMPERATURE 1). CBC1/CBC2 interact with and are phosphorylated by HT1. We propose that CBCs regulate stomatal aperture by integrating signals from BL and CO<sub>2</sub> and act as the convergence site for signals from BL and low CO<sub>2.</sub>
