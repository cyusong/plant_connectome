The development of the fertilization pore during oogenesis of the fern Ceratopteris thalictroides was followed using transmission electron microscopy. The newly formed egg is appressed closely to the adjacent cells. There are well-developed plasmodesmata between the egg and the ventral canal cell, but none between the egg and the jacket cells of the archegonium. During maturation, a separation cavity is formed around the egg. However, a pore region persistently connects the egg and the ventral canal cell. The extra egg membrane is formed by deposition of sheets of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but no ER is deposited on the inner surface of the pore region. Thus, a fertilization pore, covered by a layer of plasmalemma, is formed. The ventral canal cell undoubtedly participates the formation of the fertilization pore, probably by absorbing the sheets of ER beneath the pore region. The functional significance of the ventral canal cell in formation of the fertilization pore is discussed. The features of the mature egg include that abundant concentric membranes and osmiophilic vesicles occur in the cytoplasm of the mature egg. The initial, round nucleus of the egg eventually becomes cup-shaped. This investigation gives some new insights about the cells participating oogenesis in ferns.
