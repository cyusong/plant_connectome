Herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are involved in biotic interactions among plants as well as herbivorous and carnivorous arthropods. This review looks at the specificity in plant-carnivore communication mediated by specific blends of HIPVs as well as describes plant-herbivore and plant-plant communication mediated by specific HIPVs. Factors affecting the net benefits of HIPV production have also been examined. These specific means of communication results in high complexity in the 'interaction-information network', which should be explored further to elucidate the mechanism underlying the numerous species coexisting in ecosystems.
