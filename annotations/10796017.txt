['10796017', 'A novel genetic screen was used to identify host factors in Arabidopsis thaliana  that suppress mutations in the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) movement protein  gene (gene I). A series of small mutations was made in gene I and the mutations  were tested for their suitability in a suppressor screen. The first round of  screening yielded only revertants or second-site mutations in gene I. A  derivative of one of the second-site mutant viruses (N7) that was delayed in  symptom production was used in a second round of screening for suppressor plants  that accelerated symptom production. Two candidate suppressor plants were found  that accelerated by 1 to 4 days the first appearance of symptoms caused by the  mutant viruses. One of the suppressors (5-2), called asc1 (acceleration of  symptoms by CaMV N7), was mapped to chromosome 1. Two additional loci that  differentially affect N7 virus susceptibility in the parental Columbia and Ler  ecotypes were mapped to chromosomes 3 and 4 by quantitative trait locus (QTL)  analysis.', '2000 May', 'Mol Plant Microbe Interact', '10.1094/MPMI.2000.13.5.512', 'Howell']
