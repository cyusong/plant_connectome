Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) accumulates oil up to 35% of the total seed biomass, and its overall fatty acid composition is suitable for aviation fuel. However, for this plant to become economically viable, its oil production needs to be improved. In vivo culture conditions that resemble the development of pennycress embryos in planta were developed based on the composition of the liquid endosperm. Then, substrate uptake rates and biomass accumulation were measured from cultured pennycress embryos, revealing a biosynthetic efficiency of 93%, which is one of the highest in comparison with other oilseeds to date. Additionally, the ratio of carbon in oil to CO2 indicated that non-conventional pathways are likely to be responsible for such a high carbon conversion efficiency. To identify the reactions enabling this phenomenon, parallel labeling experiments with 13C-labeled substrates were conducted in pennycress embryos. The main findings of these labeling experiments include: (i) the occurrence of the oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway in the cytosol; (ii) the reversibility of isocitrate dehydrogenase; (iii) the operation of the plastidic NADP-dependent malic enzyme; and (iv) the refixation of CO2 by Rubisco. These reactions are key providers of carbon and reductant for fatty acid synthesis and elongation.
