The small regulatory C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE (CEP) peptide family plays crucial roles in plant growth and stress response. However, little is known about this peptide family in Brassica species. Here, we performed a systematic analysis to identify the putative <i>Brassica rapa</i> L. <i>CEP</i> (<i>BrCEP</i>) gene family. In total, 27 <i>BrCEP</i> genes were identified and they were classified into four subgroups based on the CEP motifs similarity. <i>BrCEP</i> genes displayed distinct expression patterns in response to both developmental and several environmental signals, suggesting their broad roles during <i>Brassica rapa</i> development. Furthuremore, the synthetic BrCEP3 peptide accelerated <i>Brassica rapa</i> primary root growth in a hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent manner. In summary, our work will provide fundamental insights into the physiological function of CEP peptides during <i>Brassica rapa</i> development.
