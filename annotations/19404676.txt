In order to dissect the genetic regulation of leafblade morphogenesis, 16 genotypes of pea, constructed by combining the wild-type and mutant alleles of MFP, AF, TL and UNI genes, were quantitatively phenotyped. The morphological features of the three domains of leafblades of four genotypes, unknown earlier, were described. All the genotypes were found to differ in leafblade morphology. It was evident that MFP and TL functions acted as repressor of pinna ramification, in the distal domain. These functions, with and without interaction with UNI, also repressed the ramification of proximal pinnae in the absence of AF function. The expression of MFP and TL required UNI function. AF function was found to control leafblade architecture multifariously. The earlier identified role of AF as a repressor of UNI in the proximal domain was confirmed. Negative control of AF on the UNI-dependent pinna ramification in the distal domain was revealed. It was found that AF establishes a boundary between proximal and distal domains and activates formation of leaflet pinnae in the proximal domain.
