Plants host a diverse microbiome and differentially react to the fungal species living as endophytes or around their roots through emission of volatiles. Here, using divided Petri plates for Arabidopsis-T. atroviride co-cultivation, we show that fungal volatiles increase endogenous sugar levels in shoots, roots and root exudates, which improve Arabidopsis root growth and branching and strengthen the symbiosis. Tissue-specific expression of three sucrose phosphate synthase-encoding genes (AtSPS1F, AtSPS2F and AtSPS3F), and AtSUC2 and SWEET transporters revealed that the gene expression signatures differ from those of the fungal pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria alternata and that AtSUC2 is largely repressed either by increasing carbon availability or by perception of the fungal volatile 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one. Our data point to Trichoderma volatiles as chemical signatures for sugar biosynthesis and exudation and unveil specific modulation of a critical, long-distance sucrose transporter in the plant.
