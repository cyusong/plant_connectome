['17293566', 'AvrBsT is a type III effector from Xanthomonas campestris pv vesicatoria that is  translocated into plant cells during infection. AvrBsT is predicted to encode a  Cys protease that targets intracellular host proteins. To dissect AvrBsT function  and recognition in Arabidopsis thaliana, 71 ecotypes were screened to identify  lines that elicit an AvrBsT-dependent hypersensitive response (HR) after  Xanthomonas campestris pv campestris (Xcc) infection. The HR was observed only in  the Pi-0 ecotype infected with Xcc strain 8004 expressing AvrBsT. To create a  robust pathosystem to study AvrBsT immunity in Arabidopsis, the foliar pathogen  Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) strain DC3000 was engineered to translocate  AvrBsT into Arabidopsis by the Pseudomonas type III secretion (T3S) system. Pi-0  leaves infected with Pst DC3000 expressing a Pst T3S signal fused to AvrBsT-HA  (AvrBsTHYB-HA) elicited HR and limited pathogen growth, confirming that the HR  leads to defense. Resistance in Pi-0 is caused by a recessive mutation predicted  to inactivate a carboxylesterase known to hydrolyze lysophospholipids and  acylated proteins in eukaryotes. Transgenic Pi-0 plants expressing the wild-type  Columbia allele are susceptible to Pst DC3000 AvrBsTHYB-HA infection.  Furthermore, wild-type recombinant protein cleaves synthetic p-nitrophenyl ester  substrates in vitro. These data indicate that the carboxylesterase inhibits  AvrBsT-triggered phenotypes in Arabidopsis. Here, we present the cloning and  characterization of the SUPPRESSOR OF AVRBST-ELICITED RESISTANCE1.', '2007 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.048710', 'Mudgett']
