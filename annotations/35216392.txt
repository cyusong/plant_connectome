Pangenomes aim to represent the complete repertoire of the genome diversity present within a species or cohort of species, capturing the genomic structural variance between individuals. This genomic information coupled with phenotypic data can be applied to identify genes and alleles involved with abiotic stress tolerance, disease resistance, and other desirable traits. The characterisation of novel structural variants from pangenomes can support genome editing approaches such as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR associated protein Cas (CRISPR-Cas), providing functional information on gene sequences and new target sites in variant-specific genes with increased efficiency. This review discusses the application of pangenomes in genome editing and crop improvement, focusing on the potential of pangenomes to accurately identify target genes for CRISPR-Cas editing of plant genomes while avoiding adverse off-target effects. We consider the limitations of applying CRISPR-Cas editing with pangenome references and potential solutions to overcome these limitations.
