Systemic signals induced by wounding and/or pathogen or herbivore attack may be realized by either chemical or mechanical signals. In plants a variety of electrical phenomena have been described and may be considered as signal-transducing events; such as variation potentials (VPs) and action potentials (APs) which propagate over long distances and hence are able to carry information from organ to organ. In addition, we recently described a new type of electrical long-distance signal that propagates systemically, i.e. from leaf to leaf, the 'system potential' (SP). This was possible only by establishing a non-invasive method with micro-electrodes positioned in sub-stomatal cavities of open stomata and recording apoplastic responses. Using this technical approach, we investigated the function of the peptaibole alamethicin (ALA), a channel-forming peptide from Trichoderma viride, which is widely used as agent to induce various physiological and defence responses in eukaryotic cells including plants. Although the ability of ALA to initiate changes in membrane potentials in plants has always been postulated it has never been demonstrated. Here we show that both local and long-distance electrical signals, namely depolarization, can be induced by ALA treatment.

Wounding/pathogen/herbivore attack: !induces! electrical signals
Variation potentials/action potentials: !propagate! long distances
System potential: !propagates! systemically
Alamethicin: !induces! depolarization
Micro-electrodes: !record! apoplastic responses
