['11874921', 'Plasmodesmata provide routes for communication and nutrient transfer between  plant cells by interconnecting the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. A simple  fluorescent tracer loading assay was developed to monitor patterns of  cell-to-cell transport via plasmodesmata specifically during embryogenesis. A  developmental transition in plasmodesmatal size exclusion limit was found to  occur at the torpedo stage of embryogenesis in Arabidopsis; at this time,  plasmodesmata are down-regulated, allowing transport of small (approx. 0.5 kDa)  but not large (approx. 10 kDa) tracers. This assay system was used to screen for  embryo-defective mutants, designated increased size exclusion limit of  plasmodesmata (ise), that maintain dilated plasmodesmata at the torpedo stage.  The morphology of ise1 and ise2 mutants discussed here resembled that of the  wild-type during embryo development, although the rate of their embryogenesis was  slower. The ISE1 gene was mapped to position 13 cM on chromosome I using  PCR-based biallelic markers. ise2 was found to be allelic to the previously  characterized mutant emb25 which maps to position 100 cM on chromosome I. The  results presented have implications for intercellular signaling pathways that  regulate embryonic development, and furthermore represent the first attempt to  screen directly for mutants of Arabidopsis with altered size exclusion limit of  plasmodesmata.', '2002 Mar', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.129.5.1261', 'Zambryski']
