['16997915', 'HCF164 is a membrane-anchored thioredoxin-like protein known to be indispensable  for assembly of cytochrome b6 f in the thylakoid membranes. In this study, we  report the finding that chloroplast stroma m-type thioredoxin is the source of  reducing equivalents for reduction of HCF164 in the thylakoid lumen, providing  strong evidence that higher plant chloroplasts possess a trans-membrane reducing  equivalent transfer system similar to that found in bacteria. To probe the  function of HCF164 in the lumen, a screen to identify the reducing equivalent  acceptor proteins of HCF164 was carried out by using a resin-immobilized HCF164  single cysteine mutant, leading to the isolation of putative target thylakoid  proteins. Among the newly identified target proteins, the reduction of the PSI-N  subunit of photosystem I by HCF164 was confirmed both in vitro and in isolated  thylakoids. Two components of the cytochrome b6 f complex, the cytochrome f and  Rieske FeS proteins, were also identified as novel potential target proteins. The  data presented here suggest that HCF164 serves as an important transducer of  reducing equivalents to proteins in the thylakoid lumen.', '2006 Nov 17', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M605938200', 'Hisabori']
