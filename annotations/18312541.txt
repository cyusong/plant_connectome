This study examines the extent to which lateral gas diffusion can influence intercellular CO(2) concentrations (c(i)) and thus photosynthesis in leaf areas with closed stomata. Leaves were partly greased to close stomata artificially, and effects of laterally diffusing CO(2) into the greased areas were studied by gas-exchange measurement and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. Effective quantum yields (Delta F/F(m)') across the greased areas were analysed with an image-processing tool and transposed into c(i) profiles, and lateral CO(2) diffusion coefficients (D(C'lat)), directly proportional to lateral conductivities (), were estimated using a one-dimensional (1D) diffusion model. Effective CO(2) diffusion distances in Vicia faba (homobaric), Commelina vulgaris (homobaric) and Phaseolus vulgaris (heterobaric) leaves clearly differed, and were dependent on D(C'lat), light intensity, [CO(2)], and [O(2)]: largest distances were approx. 7.0 mm for homobaric leaves (with high D(C'lat)) and approx. 1.9 mm for heterobaric leaves (low D(C'lat)). Modeled lateral CO(2) fluxes indicate large support of photosynthesis over submillimeter distances for leaves with low D(C'lat), whereas in leaves with large D(C'lat), photosynthesis can be stimulated over distances of several millimeters. For the plant species investigated, the surplus CO(2) assimilation rates of the greased leaf areas (A(gr)) differed clearly, depending on lateral conductivities of the respective leaves.
