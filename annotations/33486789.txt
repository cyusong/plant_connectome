Diatoms are globally important phytoplankton that dominate coastal and polar-ice assemblages. These environments exhibit substantial changes in salinity over dynamic spatiotemporal regimes. Rapid sensory systems are vital to mitigate the harmful consequences of osmotic stress. Population-based analyses have suggested that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling is involved in diatom osmotic sensing. However, mechanistic insight of the role of osmotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling is limited. Here, we show that Phaeodactylum Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations are essential for surviving hypo-osmotic shock. Moreover, employing novel single-cell imaging techniques we have characterised real-time Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling responses in single diatom cells to environmental osmotic perturbations. We observe that intracellular spatiotemporal patterns of osmotic-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations encode vital information regarding the nature of the osmotic stimulus. Localised Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by mild or gradual hypo-osmotic shocks are propagated globally from the apical cell tips, enabling fine-tuned cell volume regulation across the whole cell. Finally, we demonstrate that diatoms adopt Ca<sup>2+</sup> -independent and dependent mechanisms for osmoregulation. We find that efflux of organic osmolytes occurs in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> -independent manner, but this response is insufficient to mitigate cell damage during hypo-osmotic shock. By comparison, Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent signalling is necessary to prevent cell bursting via precise coordination of K<sup>+</sup> transport, and therefore is likely to underpin survival in dynamic osmotic environments.
