Phoma stem canker (blackleg) is one of the most important diseases of winter oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) worldwide and is caused by a complex that comprises at least two species: <i>Leptosphaeria maculans</i> and <i>L. biglobosa.</i> Screening a panel of field <i>Leptosphaeria</i> isolates from <i>B. napus</i> for the presence of mycoviruses revealed the presence of a novel double-stranded RNA quadrivirus in <i>L. biglobosa</i> and no viruses in <i>L. maculans.</i> Following elimination of the mycovirus, virus-infected and virus-free isogenic lines of <i>L. biglobosa</i> were created. A direct comparison of the growth and virulence of these isogenic lines illustrated that virus infection caused hypervirulence and resulted in induced systemic resistance toward <i>L. maculans</i> in <i>B. napus</i> following lower leaf preinoculation with the virus-infected isolate. Analysis of the plant transcriptome suggests that the presence of the virus leads to subtle alterations in metabolism and plant defenses. For instance, transcripts involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism are enriched in plants treated with the virus-infected isolate, while pathogenesis-related proteins, chitinases and WRKY transcription factors are differentially expressed. These results illustrate the potential for deliberate inoculation of plants with hypervirulent <i>L. biglobosa</i> to decrease the severity of Phoma stem canker later in the growing season.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).
