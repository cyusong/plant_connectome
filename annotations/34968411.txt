Tiller number is an important agronomic trait that affects crop yield. The roles of <i>OTUB1</i> in regulating tiller numbers in rice have been reported. However, the roles of <i>OTUB1</i> in wheat remain elusive. In this study, <i>TaOTUB1</i>s were identified in wheat. TaOTUB1 proteins were localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Compared with wild-type Fielder, <i>TaOTUB1</i>-RNAi transgenic wheat plants had fewer tillers. Similar to <i>OTUB1</i> in rice, the yeast double hybrid indicated that the TaOTUB1-A protein could interact with TaSPL17 and TaUBC13 proteins. The results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that the expression levels of <i>TaOTUB1</i>s decreased while those of <i>TaSPL17</i> significantly improved in <i>TaOTUB1</i>-RNAi lines. These findings suggested that TaOTUB1s influenced tiller number in wheat.
