['19060218', 'Flowering plants have evolved multigene families of the class XI myosin motors,  the functions of which remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated functional  profiles of the Arabidopsis myosins that belong to two paralogous pairs,  XI-K/XI-1 and XI-2/XI-B, using single and double gene-knockout mutants. It was  found that the myosins XI-K, XI-2, and XI-B, but not XI-1 have overlapping and  additive roles in the root hair elongation. A nonidentical set of the three  myosins, XI-K, XI-1, and XI-2, exhibited partially redundant and additive roles  in the transport of Golgi stacks, peroxisomes, and mitochondria. Conspicuously,  the double xi-k/1 knockout plants that showed the largest cumulative reduction of  the organelle velocities also exhibited a stunted plant growth and reduced  fecundity phenotype. Collectively, these results suggest that the rapid,  myosin-powered organelle trafficking is required for the optimal plant growth,  whereas a distinct myosin function, presumably the vesicular transport, is  involved in elongation of the root hairs. In addition, our data imply that the  myosin gene duplication in plants has been followed by a gradual functional  specialization of the resulting pairs of myosin paralogs.', '2008 Dec 16', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0810730105', 'Dolja']
