Effects of warming on root morphology, root mass distribution and microbial activity were studied in organic and mineral soil layers in two alpine ecosystems over>10 yr, using open-top chambers, in Swedish Lapland. Root mass was estimated using soil cores. Washed roots were scanned and sorted into four diameter classes, for which variables including root mass (g dry matter (g DM) m(-2)), root length density (RLD; cm cm(-3) soil), specific root length (SRL; m g DM(-1)), specific root area (SRA; m2 kg DM(-1)), and number of root tips m(-2) were determined. Nitrification (NEA) and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in the top 10 cm of soil were measured. Soil warming shifted the rooting zone towards the upper soil organic layer in both plant communities. In the dry heath, warming increased SRL and SRA of the finest roots in both soil layers, whereas the dry meadow was unaffected. Neither NEA nor DEA exhibited differences attributable to warming. Tundra plants may respond to climate change by altering their root morphology and mass while microbial activity may be unaffected. This suggests that carbon may be incorporated in tundra soils partly as a result of increases in the mass of the finer roots if temperatures rise.

Soil warming: !shifts! rooting zone
Warming: !increases! SRL & SRA of finest roots
Plants: !alter! root morphology & mass
Microbial activity: !unaffected! by warming
