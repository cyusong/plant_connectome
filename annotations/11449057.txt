['11449057', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as the mammalian p27(Kip1) protein,  regulate correct cell cycle progression and the integration of developmental  signals with the core cell cycle machinery. These inhibitors have been described  in plants, but their function remains unresolved. We have isolated seven genes  from Arabidopsis that encode proteins with distant sequence homology with  p27(Kip1), designated Kip-related proteins (KRPs). The KRPs were characterized by  their domain organization and transcript profiles. With the exception of KRP5,  all presented the same cyclin-dependent kinase binding specificity. When  overproduced, KRP2 dramatically inhibited cell cycle progression in leaf  primordia cells without affecting the temporal pattern of cell division and  differentiation. Mature transgenic leaves were serrated and consisted of enlarged  cells. Although the ploidy levels in young leaves were unaffected,  endoreduplication was suppressed in older leaves. We conclude that KRP2 exerts a  plant growth inhibitory activity by reducing cell proliferation in leaves, but,  in contrast to its mammalian counterparts, it may not control the timing of cell  cycle exit and differentiation.', '2001 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010087', 'Inze']
