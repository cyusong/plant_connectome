['16698895', 'NAD is a ubiquitous coenzyme involved in oxidation-reduction reactions and is  synthesized by way of quinolinate. Animals and some bacteria synthesize  quinolinate from tryptophan, whereas other bacteria synthesize quinolinate from  aspartate (Asp) using L-Asp oxidase and quinolinate synthase. We show here that  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) uses the Asp-to-quinolinate pathway. The  Arabidopsis L-Asp oxidase or quinolinate synthase gene complemented the  Escherichia coli mutant defective in the corresponding gene, and T-DNA-based  disruption of either of these genes, as well as of the gene coding for the enzyme  quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase, was embryo lethal. An analysis of  functional green fluorescent protein-fused constructs and in vitro assays of  uptake into isolated chloroplasts demonstrated that these three enzymes are  located in the plastid.', '2006 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.081091', 'Hashimoto']
