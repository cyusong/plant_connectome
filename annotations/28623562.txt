Xylem flow is progressively shut down during maturation beginning with minor veins at the stylar end and progressing to major veins and finally to bundles at the stem end. This study investigates the functionality of the xylem vascular system in developing sweet cherry fruit (Prunus avium L.). The tracers acid fuchsin and gadoteric acid were fed to the pedicel of detached fruit. The tracer distribution was studied using light microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. The vasculature of the sweet cherry comprises five major bundles. Three of these supply the flesh; two enter the pit to supply the ovules. All vascular bundles branch into major and minor veins that interconnect via numerous anastomoses. The flow in the xylem as indexed by the tracer distribution decreases continuously during development. The decrease is first evident at the stylar (distal) end of the fruit during pit hardening and progresses basipetally towards the pedicel (proximal) end of the fruit at maturity. That growth strains are the cause of the decreased conductance is indicated by: elastic strain relaxation after tissue excision, the presence of ruptured vessels in vivo, the presence of intrafascicular cavities, and the absence of tyloses.
