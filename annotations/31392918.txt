Auxin is a major phytohormone that controls root development. A role for auxin is also emerging in the control of plant-microbe interactions, including for the establishment of root endosymbiosis between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Auxin perception is important both for root colonization by AMF and for arbuscule formation. AMF produce symbiotic signals called lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) that can modify auxin homeostasis and promote lateral root formation (LRF). Since <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> (Brachypodium) has a different auxin sensitivity compared to other plant species, we wondered whether this would interfere with the effect of auxin in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Here we tested whether <i>tar2l<sup>hypo</sup></i> a Brachypodium mutant with an increase in endogenous auxin content is affected in LRF stimulation by LCOs and in AM symbiosis. We found that, in contrast to control plants, LCO treatment inhibited LRF of the <i>tar2l<sup>hypo</sup></i> mutant. However, the level of AMF colonization and the abundance of arbuscules were increased in <i>tar2l<sup>hypo</sup></i> compared to control plants, suggesting that auxin also plays a positive role in both AMF colonization and arbuscule formation in Brachypodium.
