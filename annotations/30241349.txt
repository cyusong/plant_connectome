Improving a plant's level of tolerance to oxidative stress can frequently also enhance its tolerance to several other abiotic stresses. Here, a screen of a <i>japonica</i> type rice T-DNA insertion mutant library identified a highly oxidative stress-sensitive mutant. The line exhibited premature leaf senescence, starting at the three-leaf stage, and the symptoms were particularly severe from the five-leaf stage onwards. The leaves progressively lost chlorophyll, suffered protein degradation and were compromised with respect to their photosynthetic activity; their leaf mesophyll and bulliform cells became shrunken, and several senescence-associated genes (<i>SAG</i>s), senescence-associated transcription factor genes (<i>SATF</i>s) and autophagy-related genes (<i>ATG</i>s) were progressively up-regulated. The product of the gene inactivated by the mutation, identified via positional cloning, was putatively a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The gene was denoted here as <i>RLS1</i> (reactive oxygen species-sensitive leaf senescence1). The phenotype of plants in which <i>RLS1</i> was knocked down using RNA interference was comparable to that of the <i>rls1</i> mutant. A comparative analysis of the knock-out line and the wild type leaves showed that the former accumulated more hydrogen peroxide and more malondialdehyde, expressed a heightened level of superoxide dismutase activity and a decreased level of catalase activity, and exhibited an altered transcriptional profile with respect to several <i>SAG</i>s, <i>SATF</i>s and <i>ATG</i>s, and that these effects were magnified when the plants were exposed to oxidative stress. The product of <i>RLS1</i> is presumed to be a critical component of the rice oxidative stress response and is involved in ROS (reactive oxygen species)-mediated leaf senescence.
