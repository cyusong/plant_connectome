['12740375', 'Histone acetyltransferases, which are able to acetylate histone and non-histone  proteins, play important roles in gene regulation. Many histone  acetyltransferases are related to yeast Gcn5, a component of two transcription  regulatory complexes SAGA and ADA. In this work, by characterizing a mutation in  the Arabidopsis GCN5 gene (AtGCN5) we studied the regulatory function of this  gene in controlling floral meristem activity. We show that in addition to  pleiotropic effects on plant development, this mutation also leads to the  production of terminal flowers. The flowers show homeotic transformations of  petals into stamens and sepals into filamentous structures and produce ectopic  carpels. The phenotypes correlate to an expansion of the expression domains  within floral meristems of the key regulatory genes WUSCHEL (WUS) and AGAMOUS  (AG). These results suggest that AtGCN5 is required to regulate the floral  meristem activity through the WUS/AG pathway. This study brings new elements on  the elucidation of specific developmental pathways regulated by AtGCN5 and on the  control mechanism of meristem regulatory gene expression.', '2003 Jul 25', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M302787200', 'Zhou']
