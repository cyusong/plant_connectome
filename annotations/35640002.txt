Ubiquitination is one of the best-known post-translational modifications in eukaryotes, in which different linkage types of polyubiquitination result in different outputs of the target proteins. Distinct from the well-characterized K48-linked polyubiquitination that usually serves as a signal for degradation of the target protein, K63-linked polyubiquitination often requires a unique E2 heterodimer Ubc13-UEV and alters the target protein activity instead of marking it for degradation. This review focuses on recent advances on the roles of Ubc13-UEV-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination in plant growth, development, and response to environmental stresses.
