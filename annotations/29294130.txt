Many plants have a high regenerative capacity, which can be used to induce de novo organogenesis and produce various valuable plant species and products. In the classic two-step protocol for de novo shoot organogenesis, small pieces of plant parts or tissues known as explants are initially cultured on an auxin-rich medium to produce a cell mass called callus. Upon transfer to a cytokinin-rich medium, a subpopulation of cells within the callus acquire shoot cell fate and subsequently develop into a fertile shoot. Cell fate reprogramming during de novo organogenesis is thus recognized as the decisive step to acquire new cell types progressively, in response to a change in the levels of plant hormones auxin and cytokinin. Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and completion of cell fate reprogramming remains partly understood. In this review, we sought to summarize the most recent progress made in the study of cell fate reprogramming during de novo shoot organogenesis, and highlight the critical roles of epigenetic and transcription factors in the developmental timing of cell fate reprogramming.
