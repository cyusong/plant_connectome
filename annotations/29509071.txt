With the death of Frederick Albert Lionel Clowes on 21 September 2016, plant sciences lost a member of that lineage of experimental morphologists which reaches back to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In 1949, he discovered a group of cells at the tip of the beech root apex which were metabolically inert. In 1954, he confirmed generality of this root apex feature and coined the term 'quiescent center'. He continued to study these unique cells throughout next decades up to his last papers published in 1980s. Concept of the quiescent centre of plant roots is one of the milestones in plant cell biology and plant physiology.
