['11027708', 'Ultraviolet radiation induces DNA damage products, largely in the form of  pyrimidine dimers, that are both toxic and mutagenic. In most organisms,  including Arabidopsis, these lesions are repaired both through a dimer-specific  photoreactivation mechanism and through a less efficient light-independent  mechanism. Several mutants defective in this "dark repair" pathway have been  previously described. The mechanism of this repair has not been elucidated, but  is thought to be homologous to the nucleotide excision repair mechanisms found in  other eukaryotes. Here we report the complementation of the Arabidopsis uvh1 dark  repair mutant with the Arabidopsis homolog of the yeast nucleotide excision  repair gene RAD1, which encodes one of the subunits of the 5\'-repair  endonuclease. The uvh1-2 mutant allele carries a glycine-->aspartate amino acid  change that has been previously identified to produce a null allele of RAD1 in  yeast. Although Arabidopsis homologs of genes involved in nucleotide excision  repair are readily identified by searching the genomic database, it has not been  established that these homologs are actually required for dark repair in plants.  The complementation of the Arabidopsis uvh1 mutation with the Arabidopsis RAD1  homolog clearly demonstrates that the mechanism of nucleotide excision repair is  conserved among the plant, animal, and fungal kingdoms.', '2000 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.124.2.579', 'Britt']
