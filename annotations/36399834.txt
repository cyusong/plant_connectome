Soil salinity significantly affects both Salvia miltiorrhiza growth and development as well as seed germination throughout field cultivation and production. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor (TF) MYC2 contributes significantly to plant stress resistance as a key regulator of the jasmonic acid signaling pathway. In transgenic S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots, SmMYC2 has been shown to promote the accumulation of tanshinone and salvianolic acid, but its role in S. miltiorrhiza of resistance to abiotic stress is unclear. Herein, we found methyl jasmonate (MeJA), NaCl, and PEG treatment all significantly increased SmMYC2 expression. In response to salt stress, SmMYC2 overexpression in yeast increased its rate of growth. Additionally, overexpression of SmMYC2 transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and S. miltiorrhiza hairy root showed that it might improve salt resistance in transgenic plant. In particular, compared to WT, overexpression of SmMYC2 transgenic Arabidopsis had higher levels of three antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT)), proline (Pro) content, and ABA-dependent and ABA-independent genes expression. They also had lower levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. What's more, overexpression of SmMYC2 increases the expression of flavonoid synthesis genes and the accumulation of related components in Arabidopsis. These findings imply that SmMYC2 functions as a positive regulator that regulates plant tolerance to salt through ABA-dependent and independent signaling pathways.
