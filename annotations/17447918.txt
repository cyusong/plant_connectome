Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is reported to inhibit biotrophic but benefit necrotrophic pathogens. Infection by necrotrophs can result in a massive accumulation of H(2)O(2) in hosts. Little is known of how pathogens with both growth types are affected (hemibiotrophs). The hemibiotroph, Septoria tritici, infecting wheat (Triticum aestivum) is inhibited by H(2)O(2) during the biotrophic phase, but a large H(2)O(2) accumulation occurs in the host during reproduction. Here, we infiltrated catalase, H(2)O(2) or water into wheat during the biotrophic or the necrotrophic phase of S. tritici and studied the effect of infection on host physiology to get an understanding of the survival strategy of the pathogen. H(2)O(2) removal by catalase at both early and late stages made plants more susceptible, whereas H(2)O(2) made them more resistant. H(2)O(2) is harmful to S. tritici throughout its life cycle, but it can be tolerated. The late accumulation of H(2)O(2) is unlikely to result from down-regulation of photosynthesis, but probably originates from damage to the peroxisomes during the general tissue collapse, which is accompanied by release of soluble sugars in a susceptible cultivar.
