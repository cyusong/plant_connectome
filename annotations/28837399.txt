['28837399', 'SRPP is a protein expressed in seeds and root hairs and is significantly induced  in root hairs under phosphate (Pi)-deficient conditions. Root hairs in the  knockout mutant srpp-1 display defects, i.e., suppression of cell growth and cell  death. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of SRPP during cell elongation of  root hairs and compared the transcript levels in several mutants with short root  hairs. The mRNA level was increased in wild-type plants and decreased in mutants  with short root hairs. Induction of SRPP expression by Pi starvation occurred one  or two days later than induction of Pi-deficient sensitive genes, such as PHT1  and PHF1. These results indicate that the expression of SRPP is coordinated with  root hair elongation. We hypothesize that SRPP is essential for structural  robustness of the cell walls of root hairs.', '2017 Oct 3', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.1080/15592324.2017.1368940', 'Maeshima']
