In plants, other cells can express totipotency in addition to the zygote, thus resulting in embryo differentiation; this appears evident in apomictic and epiphyllous plants. According to Haberlandt's theory, all plant cells can regenerate a complete plant if the nucleus and the membrane system are intact. In fact, under in vitro conditions, ectopic embryos and adventitious shoots can develop from many organs of the mature plant body. We are beginning to understand how determination processes are regulated and how cell specialization occurs. However, we still need to unravel the mechanisms whereby a cell interprets its position, decides its fate, and communicates it to others. The induction of somatic embryogenesis might be based on a plant growth regulator signal (auxin) to determine an appropriate cellular environment and other factors, including stress and ectopic expression of embryo or meristem identity transcription factors (TFs). Still, we are far from having a complete view of the regulatory genes, their target genes, and their action hierarchy. As in animals, epigenetic reprogramming also plays an essential role in re-establishing the competence of differentiated cells to undergo somatic embryogenesis. Herein, we describe the functions of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) transcription factors in regulating the differentiation-dedifferentiation cell process and in the developmental phase of in vitro regenerated adventitious structures.

Zygote: !expresses! Totipotency 
Nucleus/Membrane System: !regenerates! Plant 
Auxin: !determines! Cellular Environment 
TFs: !express! Embryo/Meristem Identity 
Epigenetic Reprogramming: !re-establishes! Competence 
WOX TFs: !regulate! Differentiation-Dedifferentiation Process
