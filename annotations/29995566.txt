Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) catalyzes the interconversion of nucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates using ATP as phosphate donor. This housekeeping enzyme is present in several subcellular compartments. The main isoform (NDPK1) is located in the cytosol and is highly expressed in meristems and provascular tissues. The manipulation of NDPK1 levels in transgenic potato roots demonstrates that this enzyme plays a key role in the transfer of energy between the cytosolic adenine and uridine nucleotide pools and in the distribution of carbon between starch and cellulose. Modulation of the expression of NDPK1 also alters the homeostasis of root respiration, glycolytic flux, reactive oxygen species production and growth. Herein, we propose a model summarizing the effects of the manipulation of NDPK1 levels on root metabolism. The model also accounts for G-quadruplex DNA binding, a moonlighting activity recently attributed to NDPK1, which possibly contributes to the metabolic phenotype of transgenic roots.
