['15342534', 'To identify genes with essential roles in male gametophytic development,  including postpollination (progamic) events, we have undertaken a genetic screen  based on segregation ratio distortion of a transposon-borne kanamycin-resistance  marker. In a population of 3359 Arabidopsis Ds transposon insertion lines, we  identified 20 mutants with stably reduced segregation ratios arising from reduced  gametophytic transmission. All 20 mutants showed strict cosegregation of Ds and  the reduced gametophytic transmission phenotype. Among these, 10 mutants affected  both male and female transmission and 10 mutants showed male-specific  transmission defects. Four male and female (ungud) mutants and 1 male-specific  mutant showed cellular defects in microspores and/or in developing pollen. The 6  remaining ungud mutants and 9 male-specific (seth) mutants affected pollen  functions during progamic development. In vitro and in vivo analyses are reported  for 5 seth mutants. seth6 completely blocked pollen germination, while seth7  strongly reduced pollen germination efficiency and tube growth. In contrast,  seth8, seth9, or seth10 pollen showed reduced competitive ability that was linked  to slower rates of pollen tube growth. Gene sequences disrupted in seth  insertions suggest essential functions for putative SETH proteins in diverse  processes including protein anchoring, cell wall biosynthesis, signaling, and  metabolism.', '2004 Aug', 'Genetics', '10.1534/genetics.104.030270', 'Twell']
