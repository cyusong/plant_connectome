Saline-alkaline stress is one of several major abiotic stresses in crop production. Exogenous spermidine (Spd) can effectively increase tomato saline-alkaline stress resistance by relieving membrane lipid peroxidation damage. However, the mechanism through which exogenous Spd pre-treatment triggers the tomato antioxidant system to resist saline-alkaline stress remains unclear. Whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and polyamine oxidase (PAO) are involved in Spd-induced tomato saline-alkaline stress tolerance needs to be determined. Here, we investigated the role of PAO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in exogenous Spd-induced tolerance of tomato to saline-alkaline stress. Results showed that Spd application increased the expression and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), and the ratio of reduced ascorbate (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) contents under saline-alkaline stress condition. Exogenous Spd treatment triggered endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels, <i>SlPAO4</i> gene expression, as well as PAO activity under normal conditions. Inhibiting endogenous PAO activity by 1,8-diaminooctane (1,8-DO, an inhibitor of polyamine oxidase) significantly reduced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels in the later stage. Moreover, inhibiting endogenous PAO or silencing the <i>SlPAO4</i> gene increased the peroxidation damage of tomato leaves under saline-alkaline stress. These findings indicated that exogenous Spd treatment stimulated <i>SlPAO4</i> gene expression and increased PAO activity, which mediated the elevation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level under normal conditions. Consequently, the downstream antioxidant system was activated to eliminate excessive ROS accumulation and relieve membrane lipid peroxidation damage and growth inhibition under saline-alkaline stress. In conclusion, PAO triggered H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated Spd-induced increase in the tolerance of tomato to saline-alkaline stress.
