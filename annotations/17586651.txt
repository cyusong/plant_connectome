['17586651', 'We investigated the genetic pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana targeted during  infection by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) 2b protein, known to suppress  non-cell-autonomous transgene silencing and salicylic acid (SA)-mediated virus  resistance. We show that 2b expressed from the CMV genome drastically reduced the  accumulation of 21-, 22-, and 24-nucleotide classes of viral small interfering  RNAs (siRNAs) produced by Dicer-like4 (DCL4), DCL2, and DCL3, respectively. The  defect of a CMV 2b-deletion mutant (CMV-Delta2b) in plant infection was  efficiently rescued in Arabidopsis mutants producing neither 21- nor  22-nucleotide viral siRNAs. Since genetic analysis further identifies a unique  antiviral role for DCL3 upstream of DCL4, our data indicate that inhibition of  the accumulation of distinct viral siRNAs plays a key role in 2b suppression of  antiviral silencing. Strikingly, disease symptoms caused by CMV-Delta2b in  Arabidopsis mutants defective in antiviral silencing were as severe as those  caused by CMV, demonstrating an indirect role for the silencing suppressor  activity in virus virulence. We found that production of CMV siRNAs without 2b  interference depended largely on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1 (RDR1) inducible  by SA. Given the known role of RDR6-dependent transgene siRNAs in  non-cell-autonomous silencing, our results suggest a model in which 2b inhibits  the production of RDR1-dependent viral siRNAs that confer SA-dependent virus  resistance by directing non-cell-autonomous antiviral silencing.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.047449', 'Ding']
