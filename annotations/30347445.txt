Lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) are microbial symbiotic signals that also influence root growth. In Medicago truncatula, LCOs stimulate lateral root formation (LRF) synergistically with auxin. However, the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon and whether it is restricted to legume plants are not known. We have addressed the capacity of the model monocot Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) to respond to LCOs and auxin for LRF. For this, we used a combination of root phenotyping assays, live-imaging and auxin quantification, and analysed the regulation of auxin homeostasis genes. We show that LCOs and a low dose of the auxin precursor indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) stimulated LRF in Brachypodium, while a combination of LCOs and IBA led to different regulations. Both LCO and IBA treatments locally increased endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content, whereas the combination of LCO and IBA locally increased the endogenous concentration of a conjugated form of IAA (IAA-Ala). LCOs, IBA and the combination differentially controlled expression of auxin homeostasis genes. These results demonstrate that LCOs are active on Brachypodium roots and stimulate LRF probably through regulation of auxin homeostasis. The interaction between LCO and auxin treatments observed in Brachypodium on root architecture opens interesting avenues regarding their possible combined effects during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.
