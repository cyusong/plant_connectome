['19843165', 'In Arabidopsis thaliana, the BTB/POZ-MATH (BPM) proteins comprise a small family  of six members. They have been described previously to use their broad complex,  tram track, bric-a-brac/POX virus and zinc finger (BTB/POZ) domain to assemble  with CUL3a and CUL3b and potentially to serve as substrate adaptors to  cullin-based E3-ligases in plants. In this article, we show that BPMs can also  assemble with members of the ethylene response factor/Apetala2 transcription  factor family, and that this is mediated by their meprin and TRAF (tumor necrosis  factor receptor-associated factor) homology (MATH) domain. In addition, we  provide a detailed description of BPM gene expression patterns in different  tissues and on abiotic stress treatments, as well as their subcellular  localization. This work connects, for the first time, BPM proteins with ethylene  response factor/Apetala2 family members, which is likely to represent a novel  regulatory mechanism of transcriptional control.', '2009 Nov', 'FEBS J', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07373.x', 'Hellmann']
