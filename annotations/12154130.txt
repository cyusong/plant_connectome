['12154130', 'Cell differentiation is essential for the development of multicellular organisms.  In flowering plants, the haploid male gametophytes (pollen grains) are generated  in the anther from reproductive cells called microsporocytes. Several types of  somatic cells ensure successful pollen development, and thus reproduction.  However, it is not clear what genes regulate the differentiation of these  diverse, highly specialized cells in the anther. We report here the isolation and  characterization of a novel Arabidopsis thaliana male sterile mutant, excess  microsporocytes1 (ems1), that produces excess microsporocytes, lacks tapetal  cells, and abnormally maintains middle layer cells. Although the meiotic nuclear  division in the ems1 mutant is normal, the microsporocytes do not undergo  cytokinesis, resulting in failed microsporogenesis and male sterility. The EMS1  gene encodes a putative leucine-rich repeat receptor protein kinase (LRR-RPK),  and its expression is associated with the differentiation of the microsporocytes  and tapetal cells, suggesting that EMS1 mediates signals that control the fate of  reproductive cells and their contiguous somatic cells.', '2002 Aug 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.997902', 'Ma']
