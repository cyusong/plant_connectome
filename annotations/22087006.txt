['22087006', 'Plants and animals use innate immunity as a first defense against pathogens, a  costly yet necessary tradeoff between growth and immunity. In Arabidopsis, the  regulatory leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) BAK1 combines with  the LRR-RLKs FLS2 and EFR in pathogen-associated molecular pattern  (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and the LRR-RLK BRI1 in brassinosteroid  (BR)-mediated growth. Therefore, a potential tradeoff between these pathways  mediated by BAK1 is often postulated. Here, we show a unidirectional inhibition  of FLS2-mediated immune signaling by BR perception. Unexpectedly, this effect  occurred downstream or independently of complex formation with BAK1 and  associated downstream phosphorylation. Thus, BAK1 is not rate-limiting in these  pathways. BRs also inhibited signaling triggered by the BAK1-independent  recognition of the fungal PAMP chitin. Our results suggest a general mechanism  operative in plants in which BR-mediated growth directly antagonizes innate  immune signaling.', '2012 Jan 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1109921108', 'Zipfel']
