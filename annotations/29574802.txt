Based on the activity of stem cells and their regulators, higher plants are capable of regenerating new individuals. De novo organogenesis exemplifies the regeneration of the whole plant body and is exploited widely in agriculture and biotechnology. In this Tansley insight article, we summarize recent advances that facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying de novo organogenesis. According to our current knowledge, this process can be divided into three steps, including activation of regeneration-initial cells, acquisition of competency and de novo establishment of apical meristems. The functions of stem cells and their regulators are critical to de novo organogenesis, whereas auxin and cytokinin act as triggers and linkers between different steps.
