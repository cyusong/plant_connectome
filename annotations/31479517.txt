Fast stomatal reactions enable plants to successfully cope with a constantly changing environment yet there is an ongoing debate on the stomatal regulation mechanisms in basal plant groups. We measured stomatal morphological parameters in 29 fern and allied species from temperate to tropical biomes and two outgroup angiosperm species. Stomatal dynamic responses to environmental drivers were measured in 16 ferns and the two angiosperms using a gas-exchange system. Principal components analyses were used to further reveal the structure-function relationships in stomata. We show a > 10-fold variation for stomatal opening delays and 20-fold variation for stomatal closing delays in ferns. Across species, stomatal responses to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were the fastest, while light and [CO<sub>2</sub> ] responses were slower. In most cases the outgroup species' reaction speeds to changes in environmental variables were similar to those of ferns. Correlations between stomatal response rate and size were apparent for stomatal opening in light and low [CO<sub>2</sub> ] while not evident for closing reactions and changes in VPD. No correlations between stomatal density and response speed were observed. Together, this study demonstrates different mechanisms controlling stomatal reactions in ferns at different environmental stimuli, which should be considered in future studies relating stomatal morphology and function.
