Drought is the leading environmental threat affecting crop productivity, and plants have evolved a series of mechanisms to adapt to drought stress. The FT-interacting proteins (FTIPs) and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBPs) play key roles in developmental processes, whereas their roles in the regulation of stress response are still largely unknown. Here, we report that OsFTIP1 negatively regulates drought response in rice. We showed that OsFTIP1 interacts with rice MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (OsMFT1), a PEBP that promotes rice tolerance to drought treatment. Further studies discovered that OsMFT1 interacts with two key drought-related transcription factors, OsbZIP66 and OsMYB26, regulating their binding capacity on drought-related genes and thereby enhancing drought tolerance in rice. Interestingly, we found that OsFTIP1 impedes the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of OsMFT1, implying that dynamic modulation of drought-responsive genes by the OsMFT1-OsMYB26 and OsMFT1-OsbZIP66 complexes is integral to OsFTIP1-modulated nuclear accumulation of OsMFT1. Our findings also suggest that OsMFT1 might act as a hitherto unknown nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signal that regulates drought tolerance in rice in response to environmental signals.
