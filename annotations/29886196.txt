Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) is the causal agent of rice black-streaked dwarf disease, a serious constraint to rice production. A great deal of effort has been made to elucidate the transcriptome and proteome changes of rice upon virus inoculation. However, the relationship between RBSDV invasion and rice endogenous phytohormone profiling is largely unclear. Here, we surveyed the dynamic content profiling of endogenous phytohormones, which were severely disturbed by RBSDV invasion. The levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinins (CTKs) increased, while indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellins (GAs), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA) decreased, accompanied by changes in the transcripts of genes participating in phytohormone metabolism and signalling pathways. Moreover, exogenously supplied GA<sub>3</sub> could rescue the typical dwarfing symptom, and pre-application of SA largely decreased the occurrence of RBSDV disease in rice. The results partially suggest that RBSDV successfully invaded host rice by modulating the expression patterns of phytohormone metabolism to upset the balance of plant endogenous phytohormones.
