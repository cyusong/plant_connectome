Remorins are plant-specific membrane-associated proteins and were proposed to play crucial roles in plant-pathogen interactions. However, little is known about how pathogens counter remorin-mediated host responses. In this study, by quantitative whole-proteome analysis we found that the remorin protein (NbREM1) is downregulated early in Rice stripe virus (RSV) infection. We further discovered that the turnover of NbREM1 is regulated by S-acylation modification and its degradation is mediated mainly through the autophagy pathway. Interestingly, RSV can interfere with the S-acylation of NbREM1, which is required to negatively regulate RSV infection by restricting virus cell-to-cell trafficking. The disruption of NbREM1 S-acylation affects its targeting to the plasma membrane microdomain, and the resulting accumulation of non-targeted NbREM1 is subjected to autophagic degradation, causing downregulation of NbREM1. Moreover, we found that RSV-encoded movement protein, NSvc4, alone can interfere with NbREM1 S-acylation through binding with the C-terminal domain of NbREM1 the S-acylation of OsREM1.4, the homologous remorin of NbREM1, and thus remorin-mediated defense against RSV in rice, the original host of RSV, indicating that downregulation of the remorin protein level by interfering with its S-acylation is a common strategy adopted by RSV to overcome remorin-mediated inhibition of virus movement.
