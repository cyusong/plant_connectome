Nitric oxide (NO), more benign than its more reactive and damaging related molecules, reactive oxygen species (ROS), is perfectly suited for duties as a redox signalling molecule. A key route for NO bioactivity is through S-nitrosation, the addition of an NO moiety to a protein Cys thiol (-SH). This redox-based, post-translational modification (PTM) can modify protein function analogous to more well established PTMs such as phosphorylation, for example by modulating enzyme activity, localization, or protein-protein interactions. At the heart of the underpinning chemistry associated with this PTM is sulfur. The emerging evidence suggests that S-nitrosation is integral to a myriad of plant biological processes embedded in both development and environmental relations. However, a role for S-nitrosation is perhaps most well established in plant-pathogen interactions.
