Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important grain legume domesticated independently in Mexico and Andean South America approximately 8000 years ago. Wild forms are obligate short-day plants, and relaxation of photoperiod sensitivity was important for expansion to higher latitudes and subsequent global spread. To better understand the nature and origin of this key adaptation, we examined its genetic control in progeny of a wide cross between a wild accession and a photoperiod-insensitive cultivar. We found that photoperiod sensitivity is under oligogenic control, and confirm a major effect of the Ppd locus on chromosome 1. The red/far-red photoreceptor gene PHYTOCHROME A3 (PHYA3) was identified as a strong positional candidate for Ppd, and sequencing revealed distinct deleterious PHYA3 mutations in photoperiod-insensitive Andean and Mesoamerican accessions. These results reveal the independent origins of photoperiod insensitivity within the two major common bean gene pools and demonstrate the conserved importance of PHYA genes in photoperiod adaptation of short-day legume species.
