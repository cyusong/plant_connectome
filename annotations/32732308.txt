RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) is a core component of the small RNA biogenesis pathway, but its function in meiosis is unclear. Here, we report a new allele of <i>OsRDR6</i> (<i>Osrdr6-meiosis</i> [<i>Osrdr6-mei</i>]), which causes meiosis-specific phenotypes in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). In <i>Osrdr6-mei</i>, meiotic double-strand break (DSB) formation is partially blocked. We created a biallelic mutant with more severe phenotypes, <i>Osrdr6-bi</i>, by crossing <i>Osrdr6-mei</i> with a knockout mutant, <i>Osrdr6-edit</i> In <i>Osrdr6-bi</i> meiocytes, 24 univalents were observed, and no histone H2AX phosphorylation foci were detected. Compared with the wild type, the number of 21-nucleotide small RNAs in <i>Osrdr6-mei</i> was dramatically lower, while the number of 24-nucleotide small RNAs was significantly higher. Thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were discovered in <i>Osrdr6-mei</i>, implying that OsRDR6 plays an important role in DNA methylation. There were 457 genes downregulated in <i>Osrdr6-mei</i>, including three genes, <i>CENTRAL REGION COMPONENT1</i>, <i>P31</i> <sup><i>comet</i></sup> , and <i>O. sativa SOLO DANCERS</i>, related to DSB formation. Interestingly, the downregulated genes were associated with a high level of 24-nucleotide small RNAs but less strongly associated with DMRs. Therefore, we speculate that the alteration in expression of small RNAs in <i>Osrdr6</i> mutants leads to the defects in DSB formation during meiosis, which might not be directly dependent on RNA-directed DNA methylation.
