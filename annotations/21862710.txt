['21862710', 'Arabidopsis thaliana BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE1 (BIK1) regulates immune responses  to a distinct class of pathogens. Here, mechanisms underlying BIK1 function and  its interactions with other immune response regulators were determined. We  describe BIK1 function as a component of ethylene (ET) signaling and  PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) to fungal pathogens. BIK1 in vivo kinase activity  increases in response to flagellin peptide (flg22) and the ET precursor  1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) but is blocked by inhibition of ET  perception. BIK1 induction by flg22, ACC, and pathogens is strictly dependent on  EIN3, and the bik1 mutation results in altered expression of ET-regulated genes.  BIK1 site-directed mutants were used to determine residues essential for  phosphorylation and biological functions in planta, including PTI, ET signaling,  and plant growth. Genetic analysis revealed flg22-induced PTI to Botrytis cinerea  requires BIK1, EIN2, and HUB1 but not genes involved in salicylate (SA)  functions. BIK1-mediated PTI to Pseudomonas syringae is modulated by SA, ET, and  jasmonate signaling. The coi1 mutation suppressed several bik1 phenotypes,  suggesting that COI1 may act as a repressor of BIK1 function. Thus, common and  distinct mechanisms underlying BIK1 function in mediating responses to distinct  pathogens are uncovered. In sum, the critical role of BIK1 in plant immune  responses hinges upon phosphorylation, its function in ET signaling, and complex  interactions with other immune response regulators.', '2011 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.087122', 'Mengiste']
