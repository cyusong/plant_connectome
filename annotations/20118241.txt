The UDP-sugar interconverting enzymes involved in UDP-GlcA metabolism are well described in eukaryotes but less is known in prokaryotes. Here we identify and characterize a gene (RsU4kpxs) from Ralstonia solanacearum str. GMI1000, which encodes a dual function enzyme not previously described. One activity is to decarboxylate UDP-glucuronic acid to UDP-beta-l-threo-pentopyranosyl-4''-ulose in the presence of NAD(+). The second activity converts UDP-beta-l-threo-pentopyranosyl-4''-ulose and NADH to UDP-xylose and NAD(+), albeit at a lower rate. Our data also suggest that following decarboxylation, there is stereospecific protonation at the C5 pro-R position. The identification of the R. solanacearum enzyme enables us to propose that the ancestral enzyme of UDP-xylose synthase and UDP-apiose/UDP-xylose synthase was diverged to two distinct enzymatic activities in early bacteria. This separation gave rise to the current UDP-xylose synthase in animal, fungus, and plant as well as to the plant Uaxs and bacterial ArnA and U4kpxs homologs.
