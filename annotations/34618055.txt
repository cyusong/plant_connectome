Nitrate (NO3) assimilation and signaling regulate plant growth through the relevant function of the transcription factor NIN-like Protein7 (NLP7). NO3 is also the main source for plants to produce nitric oxide (NO), which regulates growth and stress responses. NO-mediated regulation requires efficient sensing via the PROTEOLYSIS6 (PRT6)-mediated proteasome-triggered degradation of group VII of ethylene response transcription factors through the Cys/Arg N-degron pathway. The convergence of NO3 signaling and N-degron proteolysis on NO-mediated regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the functional interaction between NLP7 and PRT6 using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) double prt6 nlp7 mutant plants as well as complementation lines overexpressing NLP7 in different mutant genetic backgrounds. prt6 nlp7 mutant plants displayed several potentiated prt6 characteristic phenotypes, including slower vegetative growth, increased NO content, and diminished tolerance to abiotic stresses such as high-sucrose concentration, abscisic acid, and hypoxia-reoxygenation. Although NLP7 has an N-terminus that could be targeted by the N-degron proteolytic pathway, it was not a PRT6 substrate. The potential PRT6- and NO-regulated nucleocytoplasmic translocation of NLP7, which is likely modulated by posttranslational modifications, is proposed to act as a regulatory loop to control NO homeostasis and action.
