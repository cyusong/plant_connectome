['8020095', 'The EMB30 gene is involved in apical-basal pattern formation in the Arabidopsis  embryo. Mutations in this locus produce mutants with a wide range of seedling  phenotypes, but all of the mutants lack a root and a true hypocotyl. We have  cloned the EMB30 gene, and it encodes a protein that has similarity to the yeast  Sec7 protein and to two other open reading frames identified in clones from  humans and C. elegans. We refer to the region of similarity among these four  sequences as the Sec7 domain. The emb30-1 allele has a mutation in the Sec7  domain that alters a residue conserved in all four of these sequences, suggesting  that this domain may be important for EMB30 function. Molecular data and  microscopy studies of emb30 seedlings presented here indicate that EMB30 affects  cell division, elongation, and adhesion and functions in seedling and adult  plants as well as during embryogenic pattern formation.', '1994 Jul 1', 'Cell', '10.1016/0092-8674(94)90444-8', 'Chua']
