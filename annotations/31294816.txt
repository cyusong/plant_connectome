Germline specification is the first step during sexual and apomictic plant reproduction, and takes place in the nucellus of the ovule, a specialized domain of the reproductive flower tissues. In each case, a sporophytic cell is determined to form the sexual megaspore mother cell (MMC) or an apomictic initial cell (AIC). These differ in their developmental fates: while the MMC undergoes meiosis, the AIC modifies or omits meiosis to form the female gametophyte. Despite great interest in these distinct developmental processes, little is known about their gene regulatory basis. To elucidate the gene regulatory networks underlying germline specification, we conducted tissue-specific transcriptional profiling using laser-assisted microdissection and RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptomes of nucellar tissues between different sexual and apomictic Boechera accessions representing four species and two ploidy levels. This allowed us to distinguish between expression differences caused by genetic background or reproductive mode. Statistical data analysis revealed 45 genes that were significantly differentially expressed, and which potentially play a role for determination of the reproductive mode. Based on annotations, these included F-box genes and E3 ligases that most likely relate to genes previously described as regulators important for germline development. Our findings provide novel insights into the transcriptional basis of sexual and apomictic reproduction.
