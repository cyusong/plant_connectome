['24728113', 'HRE1alpha shows transcriptional activation activity in its C-terminal region via GCC  box but not DRE/CRT and plays an important role in root development via root  meristem cell division regulation. AtERF73/HRE1 protein, a member of the  Arabidopsis AP2/ERF family, contains a conserved AP2/ERF DNA-binding domain.  Here, we studied the molecular function of HRE1alpha, a splicing variant of  AtERF73/HRE1, as well as its role in root development. HRE1alpha-overexpressing  transgenic plants (OXs) showed tolerance to submergence. HRE1alpha showed  transcriptional activation activity via GCC box but not DRE/CRT. The 121-211 aa  region of HRE1alpha was responsible for the transcriptional activation activity, and  the region was conserved among homologs of other species but was not found in  other Arabidopsis proteins. HRE1alpha OXs showed increased primary root length due to  elevated root cell division. Our results suggest that HRE1alpha functions as a  transcription activator in the nucleus, and plays an important role in root  development through regulation of root meristem cell division.', '2014 Aug', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-014-1613-8', 'Moon']
