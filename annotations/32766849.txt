Ethylene signaling pathways regulate several physiological alterations that occur during tomato fruit ripening, such as changes in colour and flavour. The mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of genes in these pathways remain unclear, although the role of the MADS-box transcription factor RIN has been widely reported. Here, we describe a bHLH transcription factor, SlbHLH95, whose transcripts accumulated abundantly in breaker+4 and breaker+7 fruits compared with rin (ripening inhibitor) and Nr (never ripe) mutants. Moreover, the promoter activity of SlbHLH95 was regulated by RIN in vivo. Suppression of SlbHLH95 resulted in reduced sensitivity to ethylene, decreased accumulation of total carotenoids, and lowered glutathione content, and inhibited the expression of fruit ripening- and glutathione metabolism-related genes. Conversely, up-regulation of SlbHLH95 in wild-type tomato resulted in higher sensitivity to ethylene, increased accumulation of total carotenoids, slightly premature ripening, and elevated accumulation of glutathione, soluble sugar, and starch. Notably, overexpression of SlbHLH95 in rin led to the up-regulated expression of fruit ripening-related genes (FUL1, FUL2, SAUR69, ERF4, and CNR) and multiple glutathione metabolism-related genes (GSH1, GSH2, GSTF1, and GSTF5). These results clarified that SlbHLH95 participates in the regulation of fruit ripening and affects ethylene sensitivity and multiple metabolisms targeted by RIN in tomato.
