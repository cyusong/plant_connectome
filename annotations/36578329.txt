A comprehensive diagnostic method of known plant viruses and viroids is necessary to provide an accurate phytosanitary status of fruit trees. However, most widely used detection methods have a small limit on either the number of targeted viruses/viroids or the number of samples to be evaluated at a time, hampering the ability to rapidly scale up the test capacity. Here we report that by combining the power of high multiplexing PCR (499 primer pairs) of small amplicons (120-135bp), targeting 27 viruses and 7 viroids of fruit trees, followed by a single high-throughput sequencing (HTS) run, we accurately diagnosed the viruses and viroids on as many as 123 pome and stone fruit tree samples. We compared the accuracy, sensitivity, and reproducibility of this approach and contrast it with other detection methods including HTS of total RNA (RNA-Seq) and individual RT-qPCR for every fruit tree virus or viroid under the study. We argue that this robust and high-throughput cost-effective diagnostic tool will enhance the viral/viroid knowledge of fruit trees while increasing the capacity for large scale diagnostics. This approach can also be adopted for the detection of multiple viruses and viroids in other crops.
