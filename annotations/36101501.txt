Plants have a broad capacity to regenerate damaged organs. The study of wounding in multiple developmental systems has uncovered many of the molecular properties underlying plants' competence for regeneration at the local cellular level. However, in nature, wounding is rarely localized to one place, and plants need to coordinate regeneration responses at multiple tissues with environmental conditions and their physiological state. Here, we review the evidence for systemic signals that regulate regeneration on a plant-wide level. We focus on the role of auxin and sugars as short- and long-range signals in natural wounding contexts and discuss the varied origin of these signals in different regeneration scenarios. Together, this evidence calls for a broader, system-wide view of plant regeneration competence.

Auxin: !regulates! Regeneration 
Sugars: !regulate! Regeneration 
Wounding: !triggers! Auxin/Sugars 
Environment: !influences! Regeneration
