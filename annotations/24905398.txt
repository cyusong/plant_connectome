['24905398', 'Pectin in the primary plant cell wall is thought to be responsible for its  porosity, charge density, and microfibril spacing and is the main component of  the middle lamella. Plant-parasitic nematodes secrete cell wall-degrading enzymes  that macerate the plant tissue, facilitating the penetration and migration within  the roots. In sedentary endoparasitic nematodes, these enzymes are released only  during the migration of infective juveniles through the root. Later, nematodes  manipulate the expression of host plant genes, including various cell wall  enzymes, in order to induce specific feeding sites. In this study, we  investigated expression of two Arabidopsis pectate lyase-like genes (PLL), PLL18  (At3g27400) and PLL19 (At4g24780), together with pectic epitopes with different  degrees of methylesterification in both syncytia induced by the cyst nematode  Heterodera schachtii and giant cells induced by the root-knot nematode  Meloidogyne incognita. We confirmed upregulation of PLL18 and PLL19 in both types  of feeding sites with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ RT-PCR. Furthermore, the functional analysis of  mutants demonstrated the important role of both PLL genes in the development and  maintenance of syncytia but not giant cells. Our results show that both enzymes  play distinct roles in different infected root tissues as well as during  parasitism of different nematodes.', '2014 Sep', 'Mol Plant Microbe Interact', '10.1094/MPMI-01-14-0005-R', 'Bohlmann']
