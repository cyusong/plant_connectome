['17287247', 'In plants, members of microRNA (miRNA) families are often predicted to target the  same or overlapping sets of genes. It has thus been hypothesized that these  miRNAs may act in a functionally redundant manner. This hypothesis is tested here  by studying the effects of elimination of all three members of the MIR164 family  from Arabidopsis. It was found that a loss of miR164 activity leads to a severe  disruption of shoot development, in contrast to the effect of mutation in any  single MIR164 gene. This indicates that these miRNAs are indeed functionally  redundant. Differences in the expression patterns of the individual MIR164 genes  imply, however, that redundancy among them is not complete, and that these miRNAs  show functional specialization. Furthermore, the results of molecular and genetic  analyses of miR164-mediated target regulation indicate that miR164 miRNAs  function to control the transcript levels, as well as the expression patterns, of  their targets, suggesting that they might contribute to developmental robustness.  For two of the miR164 targets, namely CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1) and CUC2, we  provide evidence for their involvement in the regulation of growth and show that  their derepression in miR164 loss-of-function mutants is likely to account for  most of the mutant phenotype.', '2007 Mar', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.02817', 'Meyerowitz']
