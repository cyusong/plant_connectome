['11569502', 'We screened a gene trap library of Arabidopsis thaliana and isolated a line in  which a gene encoding a homologue of monofunctional aspartate kinase was trapped  by the reporter gene. Aspartate kinase (AK) is a key enzyme in the biosynthsis of  aspartate family amino acids such as lysine, threonine, isoleucine, and  methionine. In plants, two types of AK are known: one is AK which is sensitive to  feedback inhibition by threonine and carries both AK and homoserine dehydrogenase  (HSD) activities. The other one is monofunctional, sensitive to lysine and  synergistically S-adenosylmethionine, and has only AK activity. We concluded that  the trapped gene encoded a monofunctional aspartate kinase and designated as  AK-lys3, because it lacked the HSD domain and had an amino acid sequence highly  similar to those of the monofunctional aspartate kinases ofA. thaliana. AK-lys3  was highly expressed in xylem of leaves and hypocotyls and stele of roots.  Significant expression of this gene was also observed in trichomes after bolting.  Slight expression of AK-lys3 was detected in vascular bundles and mesophyll cells  of cauline leaves, inflorescence stems, sepals, petals, and stigmas. These  results indicated that this aspartate kinase gene was not expressed uniformly but  in a spatially specific manner.', '2001 Jun', 'Genes Genet Syst', '10.1266/ggs.76.189', 'Machida']
