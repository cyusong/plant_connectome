['23129207', 'Investigations into the biochemical processes and regulatory mechanisms of  nitrogen (N) utilization can aid in understanding how N is used efficiently in  plants. This report describes a deficiency in N utilization in an Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) transfer DNA insertion mutant of the mitochondrial  folylpolyglutamate synthetase gene DFC, which catalyzes the conjugation of  glutamate residues to the tetrahydrofolate during folate synthesis. The mutant  seedlings displayed several metabolic changes that are typical of plant responses  to low-N stress, including increased levels of starch and anthocyanin synthesis  as well as decreased levels of soluble protein and free amino acid, as compared  with those in wild-type seedlings when external N was sufficient. More striking  changes were observed when dfc seedlings were grown under N-limited conditions,  including shorter primary roots, fewer lateral roots, higher levels of glycine  and carbon-N ratios, and lower N content than those in wild-type seedlings. Gene  expression studies in mutant seedlings revealed altered transcript levels of  several genes involved in folate biosynthesis and N metabolism. The biochemical  and metabolic changes also suggested that N assimilation is drastically perturbed  due to a loss of DFC function. The observation that elevated CO(2) partly rescued  the dfc phenotypes suggests that the alterations in N metabolism in dfc may be  mainly due to a defect in photorespiration. These results indicate that DFC is  required for N utilization in Arabidopsis and provide new insight into a  potential interaction between folate and N metabolism.', '2013 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.203430', 'Zhang']
