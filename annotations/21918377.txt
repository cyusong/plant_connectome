Studies performed in different organisms have highlighted the importance of protein kinase CK2 in cell growth and cell viability. However, the plant signaling pathways in which CK2 is involved are largely unknown. We have reported that a dominant-negative mutant of CK2 in Arabidopsis thaliana shows phenotypic traits that are typically linked to alterations in auxin-dependent processes. We demonstrated that auxin transport is, indeed, impaired in these mutant plants, and that this correlates with misexpression and mislocalization of PIN efflux transporters and of PINOID. Our data establishes a link between CK2 activity and the regulation of auxin homeostasis in plants, strongly suggesting that CK2 might be required at multiple points of the pathways regulating auxin fluxes.
