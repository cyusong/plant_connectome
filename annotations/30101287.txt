In rose (Rosa hybrida), flower senescence is accelerated by ethylene and delayed by cytokinins (CTKs). However, the effectors that regulate these processes are not currently understood. In this study, we identified an APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) gene, RhERF113, which was induced by ethylene and up-regulated during flower senescence in most floral organs, including sepal, petal, stamen and pistil. The virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of RhERF113 expression accelerated rose flower senescence, which was accompanied by a lower CTK content in the flowers. This accelerated senescence could be restored by exogenous CTK treatment. Moreover, the expression levels of genes related to CTK biosynthesis and signaling, including ISOPENTENYL TRANSFERASE 5 (RhIPT5), RhIPT8, HISTIDINE KINASE 2 (RhHK2), RhHK3, CYTOKININ RESPONSE REGULATOR 3 (RhCRR3), RhCRR5, RhCRR8, HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 6 (RhHB6) and PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 10.1 (RhPR10.1), were decreased in the RhERF113-silenced rose flowers. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RhERF113 delays ethylene-induced flower senescence by increasing the CTK content of the floral tissues.
