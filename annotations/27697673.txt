Seed dormancy provides optimum timing for seed germination and subsequent seedling growth, but the mechanism of seed dormancy is still poorly understood. Here, we used Dongxiang wild rice (DXWR) seeds to investigate the dormancy behavior and the differentially changed proteome in embryo and endosperm during dormancy release. DXWR seed dormancy was caused by interaction of embryo and its surrounding structure, and was an intermediate physiological dormancy. During seed dormancy release, a total of 109 and 97 protein spots showed significant change in abundance and were successfully identified in embryo and endosperm, respectively. As a result of dormancy release, the abundance of nine proteins involved in storage protein, cell defense and rescue and energy changed in the same way in both embryo and endosperm, while 67 and 49 protein spots changed differentially in embryo and endosperm, respectively. Dormancy release of DXWR seeds was closely associated with degradation of storage proteins in both embryo and endosperm. At the same time, the abundance of proteins involved in metabolism, glycolysis and TCA cycle, cell growth and division, protein synthesis and destination and signal transduction increased in embryos while staying constant or decreasing in endosperms.
