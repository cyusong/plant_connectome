Ascorbate is a major antioxidant buffer in plants. Several approaches have been used to increase the ascorbate content of fruits and vegetables. Here, we combined forward genetics with mapping-by-sequencing approaches using an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized Micro-Tom population to identify putative regulators underlying a high-ascorbate phenotype in tomato fruits. Among the ascorbate-enriched mutants, the family with the highest fruit ascorbate level (P17C5, up to 5-fold wild-type level) had strongly impaired flower development and produced seedless fruit. Genetic characterization was performed by outcrossing P17C5 with cv. M82. We identified the mutation responsible for the ascorbate-enriched trait in a cis-acting upstream open reading frame (uORF) involved in the downstream regulation of GDP-l-galactose phosphorylase (GGP). Using a specific CRISPR strategy, we generated uORF-GGP1 mutants and confirmed the ascorbate-enriched phenotype. We further investigated the impact of the ascorbate-enriched trait in tomato plants by phenotyping the original P17C5 EMS mutant, the population of outcrossed P17C5 × M82 plants, and the CRISPR-mutated line. These studies revealed that high ascorbate content is linked to impaired floral organ architecture, particularly anther and pollen development, leading to male sterility. RNA-seq analysis suggested that uORF-GGP1 acts as a regulator of ascorbate synthesis that maintains redox homeostasis to allow appropriate plant development.
