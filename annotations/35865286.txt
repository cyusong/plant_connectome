Drought stress often occurred in citrus to limit its growth, distribution, and fruit quality. Cuticular waxes play an important role in regulating plant tolerance to drought stress. Plant enoyl-CoA reductase (ECR) is involved in the biosynthesis of cuticular waxes and catalyzes the last step of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) elongation. In this study, a putative <i>ECR</i> gene, named <i>CsECR</i>, was cloned from "Newhall" navel orange. <i>CsECR</i> protein has high identities with other plant ECR proteins and contained a conserved NADP/NAD-binding motif and three conserved functional sites. The highest expression of <i>CsECR</i> was observed in leaves, followed by stems, flavedos, ovaries, juice sacs, stigmas, stamens, albedos, and petals. Besides, the expression of <i>CsECR</i> was significantly induced by PEG6000 and ABA treatments. Ectopic overexpression of <i>CsECR</i> increased the contents of total waxes and aliphatic wax fractions (<i>n</i>-fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, <i>n</i>-alkanes, alkenes, iso-, and anteiso-alkanes) in the leaves and fruits of the transgenic tomato. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of <i>CsECR</i> reduced the cuticle permeability in the leaves and fruits of the transgenic tomato and increased its tolerance to drought stress. Taken together, our results revealed that <i>CsECR</i> plays an important role in plant response to drought stresses by regulating cuticular wax biosynthesis.
