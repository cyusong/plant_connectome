['31097675', 'Aurora kinases are key regulators of mitosis. Multicellular eukaryotes generally  possess two functionally diverged types of Aurora kinases. In plants, including  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), these are termed alpha- and beta-Auroras. As the  functional specification of Aurora kinases is determined by their specific  interaction partners, we initiated interactomics analyses using both Arabidopsis  alpha-Aurora kinases (AUR1 and AUR2). Proteomics results revealed that TPX2-LIKE  PROTEINS2 and 3 (TPXL2/3) prominently associated with alpha-Auroras, as did the  conserved TPX2 to a lower degree. Like TPX2, TPXL2 and TPXL3 strongly activated  the AUR1 kinase but exhibited cell-cycle-dependent localization differences on  microtubule arrays. The separate functions of TPX2 and TPXL2/3 were also  suggested by their different influences on AUR1 localization upon ectopic  expressions. Furthermore, genetic analyses showed that TPXL3, but not TPX2 and  TPXL2, acts nonredundantly to enable proper embryo development. In contrast to  vertebrates, plants have an expanded TPX2 family and these family members have  both redundant and unique functions. Moreover, as neither TPXL2 nor TPXL3  contains the C-terminal Kinesin-5 binding domain present in the canonical TPX2,  the targeting and activity of this kinesin must be organized differently in  plants.', '2019 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.18.01515', 'ORCID:']
