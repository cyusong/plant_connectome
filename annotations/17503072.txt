Pondweed (Potamogeton distinctus A. Benn.), a monocot aquatic plant species, has turions, which are overwintering buds forming underground as an asexual reproductive organ. Turions not only survive for more than one month but also elongate under strict anoxia, maintaining high-energy charge by activation of fermentation. We cloned 82 cDNA fragments of genes, that are up-regulated during anoxic growth of pondweed turions, by suppression subtractive hybridization. The transcript levels of 44 genes were confirmed to be higher under anoxia than those in air by both Northern blot analysis and a semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. A homology search for their nucleotide sequences revealed that some of them are highly homologous to known sequences of genes from other plants. They included alcohol dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), vacuolar H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase and a plasma membrane intrinsic protein. Time courses of transcript accumulation of some genes under anoxia were different from those in air. The activity of PDC increased under anoxic conditions but the activities of GAPDH and pyrophosphatase remained constant after anoxic treatment. Anoxically up-regulated genes are possibly involved in physiological events to control energy production, pH regulation and cell growth under anoxia. These results suggest that transcriptional regulation of these genes serves as an essential part of survival and growth of pondweed turions under anoxia.
