Phytopathogens invade into plant apoplast and proliferate by assimilating nutrition from plant cells. Plants depend on sophisticated defensive strategies to resist this invasion. Therefore, pathogenic disease and plant disease resistance are two opposite phases. Fascinating molecular mechanisms uncovered that interactions between plant and pathogen are multilevel and dynamic processes. On one side, plant immunity system contains multiple layers mainly including the perception of common pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) using distinct cell-surface pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to activate intracellular signaling pathways for broad-spectrum immunity, and the recognition of pathogen virulence proteins by the specific intracellular disease resistance (R) proteins for cultivar-specific immunity. On the opposite side, the bacterial pathogens employ virulence factors, such as phytotoxin and type III effectors (T3SEs) to interfere with the host immunity in different levels. Meanwhile, natural selection drives plants and pathogens to evolve new strategies to confront with each other constantly. The present review highlights recent insights about Arabidopsis immunity and mechanisms for Pseudomonas syringae to counteract this immunity to give a full understanding of plant-pathogen interactions.
