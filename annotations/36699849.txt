This study investigated the barley lesion mimic mutant (LMM) <i>5386</i>, evidenced by a leaf brown spot phenotype localized on the chromosome 3H, and its conferred basal resistance to <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>. RNA-seq analysis identified 1453 genes that were differentially expressed in LMM <i>5386</i> compared to those in the wild type. GO and KEGG functional annotations suggested that lesion mimic formation was mediated by pathways involving oxidation reduction and glutathione metabolism. Additionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in brown spots was substantially higher in LMM <i>5386</i> than in the wild-type plant; therefore, antioxidant competence, which is indicated by ROS accumulation, was significantly lower in LMM <i>5386</i>. Furthermore, the reduction of glycine in LMM <i>5386</i> inhibited glutathione biosynthesis. These results suggest that the decrease in antioxidant competence and glutathione biosynthesis caused considerable ROS accumulation, leading to programmed cell death, which eventually reduced the yield components in LMM <i>5386</i>.
