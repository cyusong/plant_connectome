['9210330', 'Shoots of higher plants grow upward in response to gravity. To elucidate the  molecular mechanism of this response, we have isolated shoot gravitropism (sgr)  mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this report, we describe three novel mutants,  sgr4-1, sgr5-1 and sgr6-1 whose inflorescence stems showed abnormal gravitropic  responses as previously reported for sgr1, sgr2 and sgr3. These new sgr mutations  were recessive and occurred at three independent genetic loci. The sgr4-1 mutant  showed severe defect in gravitropism of both inflorescence stem and hypocotyl but  were normal in root gravitropism as were sgr1 and sgr2. The sgr5-1 and sgr6-1  mutants showed reduced gravitropism only in inflorescence stems but normal in  both hypocotyls and roots as sgr3. These results support the hypothesis that some  mechanisms of gravitropism are genetically different in these three organs in A.  thaliana. In addition, these mutants showed normal phototropic responses,  suggesting that SGR4, SGR5 and SGR6 genes are specifically involved in gravity  perception and/or gravity signal transduction for the shoot gravitropic response.', '1997 May', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029201', 'Tasaka']
