['23448237', 'A family of six genes encoding acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs), ACBP1-ACBP6,  has been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we demonstrate  that ACBP1 promotes abscisic acid (ABA) signaling during germination and seedling  development. ACBP1 was induced by ABA, and transgenic Arabidopsis  ACBP1-over-expressors showed increased sensitivity to ABA during germination and  seedling development, whereas the acbp1 mutant showed decreased ABA sensitivity  during these processes. Subsequent RNA assays showed that ACBP1 over-production  in 12-day-old seedlings up-regulated the expression of PHOSPHOLIPASE Dalpha1 (PLDalpha1)  and three ABA/stress-responsive genes: ABA-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN1  (AREB1), RESPONSE TO DESICCATION29A (RD29A) and bHLH-TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR MYC2  (MYC2). The expression of AREB1 and PLDalpha1 was suppressed in the acbp1 mutant in  comparison with the wild type following ABA treatment. PLDalpha1 has been reported to  promote ABA signal transduction by producing phosphatidic acid, an important  lipid messenger in ABA signaling. Using lipid profiling, seeds and 12-day-old  seedlings of ACBP1-over-expressing lines were shown to accumulate more  phosphatidic acid after ABA treatment, in contrast to lower phosphatidic acid in  the acbp1 mutant. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicated that  ACBP1 interacts with PLDalpha1 at the plasma membrane. Their interaction was further  confirmed by yeast two-hybrid analysis. As recombinant ACBP1 binds phosphatidic  acid and phosphatidylcholine, ACBP1 probably promotes PLDalpha1 action. Taken  together, these results suggest that ACBP1 participates in ABA-mediated seed  germination and seedling development.', '2013 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12121', 'Chye']
