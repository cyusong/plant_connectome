Plant immunity relies on the perception of Microbe-Associate Molecular Patterns (MAMPs) from invading microbes to induce defense responses that suppress attempted infections. It has been proposed that MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI) suppresses bacterial infections by suppressing the onset of bacterial virulence. However, the mechanisms by which plants exert this action are poorly understood. Here, we showed that MAMP perception in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) induces the accumulation of free amino acids in a salicylic acid (SA)-dependent manner. When co-infiltrated with Glutamine and Serine, two of the MAMP-induced highly accumulating amino acids, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 expressed low levels of virulence genes and failed to produce robust infections in otherwise susceptible plants. When applied exogenously, Glutamine and Serine directly suppressed bacterial virulence and growth, bypassing MAMP perception and SA-signaling. In addition, an increased level of endogenous Glutamine in the leaf apoplast of a gain-of-function mutant of Glutamine Dumper-1 rescued the partially compromised bacterial virulence- and growth-suppressing phenotype of the SA-induced deficient-2 (sid2) mutant. Our data suggest that MTI suppresses bacterial infections by delaying the onset of virulence with an excess of amino acids at the early stages of infection.
