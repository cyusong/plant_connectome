['21199950', 'RNase T2 enzymes are conserved in most eukaryotic genomes, and expression  patterns and phylogenetic analyses suggest that they may carry out an important  housekeeping role. However, the nature of this role has been elusive. Here we  show that RNS2, an intracellular RNase T2 from Arabidopsis thaliana, is essential  for normal ribosomal RNA recycling. This enzyme is the main endoribonuclease  activity in plant cells and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),  ER-derived structures, and vacuoles. Mutants lacking RNS2 activity accumulate RNA  intracellularly, and rRNA in these mutants has a longer half-life. Normal rRNA  turnover seems essential to maintain cell homeostasis because rns2 mutants  display constitutive autophagy. We propose that RNS2 is part of a process that  degrades rRNA to recycle its components. This process appears to be conserved in  all eukaryotes.', '2011 Jan 18', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1009809108', 'Macintosh']
