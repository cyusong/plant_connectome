Cell death is a biological process that occurs during differentiation and maturation of certain cell types, during senescence, or as part of a defense mechanism against microbial pathogens. Intercellular coordination is thought to be necessary to restrict the spread of death signals, although little is known about how cell death is controlled at the tissue level. The recent characterization of a plasmodesmal protein, PDLP5, has revealed an important role for plasmodesmal control during salicylic acid-mediated cell death responses. Here, we discuss molecular factors that are potentially involved in PDLP5 expression, and explore possible signaling networks that PDLP5 interacts with during basal defense responses.
