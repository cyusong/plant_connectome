['28837631', 'Previous studies have identified the Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor  WRKY70 as a node of convergence for salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid  (JA)-mediated defense signal pathways and, together with its closest homolog  WRKY54, as a negative regulator of SA biosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate that  WRKY70 together with WRKY54 negatively affect the response of Arabidopsis to the  necrotrophic pathogens Pectobacterium carotovorum and Botrytis cinerea, but not  to the hemibiotroph Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) DC3000, as revealed by  mutants studies. Unstressed wrky54wrky70 double mutants exhibited increased  levels of SA, accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and up-regulated  expression of both SA and JA/ethylene (ET) responsive defense related genes.  Additionally, protein cross-linking in cell wall was promoted by endogenous SA,  suggesting involvement of wall-associated defenses against necrotrophs. This  response to necrotrophs was compromised by introducing the sid2-1 allele  impairing SA biosynthesis and leading to reduction of H2O2 content and of defense  gene expression. The data suggest that the elevated SA level in the wrky54wrky70  double mutant results in moderate accumulation of H2O2, in promoting cell wall  fortification and consequently enhanced resistance to necrotrophs but is not  sufficient to trigger hypersensitive reaction (HR)-like cell death and resistance  to biotrophs/hemibiotrophs like Pst DC3000.', '2017', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0183731', 'Palva']
