Plant metabolism is strongly dependent on plastids. Besides hosting the photosynthetic machinery, these endosymbiotic organelles synthesize starch, fatty acids, amino acids, nucleotides, tetrapyrroles, and isoprenoids. Virtually all enzymes involved in plastid-localized metabolic pathways are encoded by the nuclear genome and imported into plastids. Once there, protein quality control systems ensure proper folding of the mature forms and remove irreversibly damaged proteins. The Clp protease is the main machinery for protein degradation in the plastid stroma. Recent work has unveiled an increasing number of client proteins of this proteolytic complex in plants. Notably, a substantial proportion of these substrates are required for normal chloroplast metabolism, including enzymes involved in the production of essential tetrapyrroles and isoprenoids such as chlorophylls and carotenoids. The Clp protease complex acts in coordination with nuclear-encoded plastidial chaperones for the control of both enzyme levels and proper folding (i.e. activity). This communication involves a retrograde signaling pathway, similarly to the unfolded protein response previously characterized in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Coordinated Clp protease and chaperone activities appear to further influence other plastid processes, such as the differentiation of chloroplasts into carotenoid-accumulating chromoplasts during fruit ripening.
