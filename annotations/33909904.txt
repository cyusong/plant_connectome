Reproductive development is a crucial process during plant growth. The structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) 5/6 complex has been studied in various species. However, there are few studies on the biological function of SMC6 in plant development, especially during reproduction. In this study, knocking out of both AtSMC6A and AtSMC6B led to severe defects in Arabidopsis seed development, and expression of AtSMC6A or AtSMC6B could completely restore seed abortion in the smc6a-/-smc6b-/-double mutant. Knocking down AtSMC6A in the smc6b-/- mutant led to defects in female and male development and decreased fertility. The double mutation also resulted in loss of cell viability, and caused embryo and endosperm cell death through vacuolar cell death and necrosis. Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in embryo patterning, endosperm cellularisation, DNA damage repair, cell cycle regulation, and DNA replication were significantly changed in the albino seeds of the double mutant. Moreover, we found that the SMC5/6 complex may participate in the SOG1 (SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1)-dependent DNA damage repair pathway. These findings suggest that both AtSMC6A and AtSMC6B are functionally redundant and play important roles in seed and gametophyte development through maintaining chromosome stability in Arabidopsis.
