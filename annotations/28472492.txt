Transport proteins are crucial for cellular function at all levels. Numerous importers and exporters facilitate transport of a diverse array of metabolites and ions intra- and intercellularly. Identification of transporter function is essential for understanding biological processes at both the cellular and organismal level. Assignment of a functional role to individual transporter proteins or to identify a transporter with a given substrate specificity has notoriously been challenging. Recently, major advances have been achieved in function-driven screens, phenotype-driven screens, and in silico-based approaches. In this review, we highlight examples that illustrate how new technology and tools have advanced identification and characterization of plant transporter functions.
