The photoreversibility of plant phytochromes enables continuous surveillance of the ambient light environment. Through expression of profluorescent, photoinsensitive Tyr-to-His mutant alleles of Arabidopsis thaliana phytochrome B (PHYB(Y276H)) and Arabidopsis phytochrome A (PHYA(Y242H)) in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, we demonstrate that photoconversion is not a prerequisite for phytochrome signaling. PHYB(Y276H)-expressing plants exhibit chromophore-dependent constitutive photomorphogenesis, light-independent phyB(Y276H) nuclear localization, constitutive activation of genes normally repressed in darkness, and light-insensitive seed germination. Fluence rate analyses of transgenic plants expressing PHYB(Y276H), PHYA(Y242H), and other Y(GAF) mutant alleles of PHYB demonstrate that a range of altered light-signaling activities are associated with mutation of this residue. We conclude that the universally conserved GAF domain Tyr residue, with which the bilin chromophore is intimately associated, performs a critical role in coupling light perception to signal transduction by plant phytochromes.
