Pectobacterium carotovorum are economically important plant pathogens that cause plant soft rot. These enterobacteria display high diversity world-wide. Their pathogenesis depends on production and secretion of virulence factors such as plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, type III effectors, a necrosis-inducing protein, and a secreted virulence factor from Xanthomonas spp., which are tightly regulated by quorum sensing. Pectobacterium carotovorum also present pathogen-associated molecular patterns that could participate in their pathogenicity. In this study, by using suspension cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, we correlate plant cell death and pectate lyase activities during coinfection with different P. carotovorum strains. When comparing soft rot symptoms induced on potato slices with pectate lyase activities and plant cell death observed during coculture with Arabidopsis thaliana cells, the order of strain virulence was found to be the same. Therefore, Arabidopsis thaliana cells could be an alternative tool to evaluate rapidly and efficiently the virulence of different P. carotovorum strains.
