['30914467', 'Light elicits different growth responses in different organs of plants. These  organ-specific responses are prominently displayed during de-etiolation. While  major light-responsive components and early signaling pathways in this process  have been identified, this information has yet to explain how organ-specific  light responses are achieved. Here, we report that members of the TEOSINTE  BRANCHED1, CYCLOIDEA, and PCF (TCP) transcription factor family participate in  photomorphogenesis and facilitate light-induced cotyledon opening in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA  sequencing analyses indicated that TCP4 targets a number of SMALL AUXIN  UPREGULATED RNA (SAUR) genes that have previously been shown to exhibit  organ-specific, light-responsive expression. We demonstrate that TCP4-like  transcription factors, which are predominantly expressed in the cotyledons of  both light- and dark-grown seedlings, activate SAUR16 and SAUR50 expression in  response to light. Light regulates the binding of TCP4 to the promoters of  SAUR14, SAUR16, and SAUR50 through PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs). PIF3,  which accumulates in etiolated seedlings and its levels rapidly decline upon  light exposure, also binds to the SAUR16 and SAUR50 promoters, while suppressing  the binding of TCP4 to these promoters in the dark. Our study reveals that the  interplay between light-responsive factors PIFs and the developmental regulator  TCP4 determines the cotyledon-specific light regulation of SAUR16 and SAUR50,  which contributes to cotyledon closure and opening before and after  de-etiolation.', '2019 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00803', 'ORCID:']
