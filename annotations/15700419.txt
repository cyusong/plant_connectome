The effects of rapid induction and subsequent relaxation of cold-induced photo-inhibition on pigment chemistry of Eucalyptus nitens (Deane and Maiden) Maiden seedling leaves was assessed. The seedlings were subjected to four treatments in a nursery, fertilised or non-fertilised and shaded or non-shaded, before induction of photoinhibition in a growth chamber. Within 2 days, growth chamber conditions decreased photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and increased xanthophyll-cycle conversion ratio. This was associated with decreased levels of total chlorophyll and increased levels of xanthophyll-cycle pigments. After 8 days, Fv/Fm of all treatments rose. Anthocyanin Levels gradually increased until day eight, except in non-shaded, non-fertilised seedlings, which had high levels before the induction of photoinhibition. Visible spectroscopy indicated increased absorption between 500 and 590nm, indicative of anthocyanin absorption. Electron transport rate after xanthophyll-cycle relaxation was half that measured before induction of photoinhibition. The findings indicate that anthocyanins may provide a photoprotective role in E. nitens seedlings under conditions of photoinhibition.
