['9801140', 'The heat shock factor (HSF1) is the central regulator of the heat stress (hs)  response and is required for stimulating the transcription of the hs genes and  consequently the expression of heat shock proteins. To promote the polymerase  II-dependent transcription of the hs genes, HSF has to communicate with the basal  transcription machinery. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana HSF1  interacts directly with TBP, the general TATA box binding transcription factor,  as shown by affinity chromatography and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses  in vitro. An in vivo interaction between AtHSF1 and AtTBP1 was suggested by  results employing the yeast two-hybrid system.', '1998 Oct 9', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(98)01152-1', 'Schoffl']
