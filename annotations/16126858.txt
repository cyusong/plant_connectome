['16126858', 'The copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) has been identified as a key  factor integrating copper into copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) in  yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammals. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana), only one putative CCS gene (AtCCS, At1g12520) has been identified. The  predicted AtCCS polypeptide contains three distinct domains: a central domain,  flanked by an ATX1-like domain, and a C-terminal domain. The ATX1-like and  C-terminal domains contain putative copper-binding motifs. We have investigated  the function of this putative AtCCS gene and shown that a cDNA encoding the open  reading frame predicted by The Arabidopsis Information Resource complemented only  the cytosolic and peroxisomal CuZnSOD activities in the Atccs knockout mutant,  which has lost all CuZnSOD activities. However, a longer AtCCS cDNA, as predicted  by the Munich Information Centre for Protein Sequences and encoding an extra 66  amino acids at the N terminus, could restore all three, including the  chloroplastic CuZnSOD activities in the Atccs mutant. The extra 66 amino acids  were shown to direct the import of AtCCS into chloroplasts. Our results indicated  that one AtCCS gene was responsible for the activation of all three types of  CuZnSOD activity. In addition, a truncated AtCCS, containing only the central and  C-terminal domains without the ATX1-like domain failed to restore any CuZnSOD  activity in the Atccs mutant. This result indicates that the ATX1-like domain is  essential for the copper chaperone function of AtCCS in planta.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.065284', 'Jinn']
