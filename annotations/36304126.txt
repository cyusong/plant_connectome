['36304126', 'The primexine formation and plasma membrane undulation are the crucial steps of  pollen wall formation in many angiosperms. However, the molecular mechanism  underlining these processes is largely unknown. In Arabidopsis, NEW ENHANCER OF  ROOT DWARFISM1 (NERD1), a transmembrane protein, was reported to play pleiotropic  roles in plant development including male fertility control; while, how NERD1  disruption impacts male reproduction is yet unclear. Here, we revealed that the  male sterility of nerd1 mutants is attributed to defects in early steps of pollen  wall formation. We found that nerd1-2 is void of primexine formation and  microspore plasma membrane undulation, defective in callose deposition.  Consequently, sporopollenin precursors are unable to deposit and assemble on the  microspore surface, but instead accumulated in the anther locule and tapetal  cells, and ultimately leading to microspore abortion. NERD1 is localized in the  Golgi and is expressed in both vegetative and reproductive organs, with the  highest expression in reproductive tissues, including the tapetum, male  meiocytes, tetrads and mature pollen grains. Our results suggest that NERD1 is  required for the primexine deposition and microspore plasma membrane undulation,  thus essential for sporopollenin assembly and pollen exine formation.', '2020 Oct', 'aBIOTECH', '10.1007/s42994-020-00022-1', 'ORCID:']
