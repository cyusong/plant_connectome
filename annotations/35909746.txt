Eutypa dieback and Esca complex are fungal diseases of grape that cause large economic losses in vineyards. These diseases require, or are enhanced by, fungal consortia growth which leads to the deterioration of the wood tissue in the grapevine trunk; however, pathogenesis and the underlying mechanisms involved in the woody tissue degradation are not understood. We examined the role that the consortia fungal metabolome have in generating oxygen radicals that could potentially play a role in trunk decay and pathogenesis. Unique metabolites were isolated from the consortia fungi with some metabolites preferentially reducing iron whereas others were involved in redox cycling to generate hydrogen peroxide. Metabolite suites with different functions were produced when fungi were grown separately vs. when grown in consortia. Chelator-mediated Fenton (CMF) chemistry promoted by metabolites from these fungi allowed for the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. We hypothesize that this mechanism may be involved in pathogenicity in grapevine tissue as a causal mechanism associated with trunk wood deterioration/necrosis in these two diseases of grape.
