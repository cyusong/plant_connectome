Higher plants and cyanobacteria metabolize sucrose (Suc) by a similar set of enzymes. Suc synthase (SuS, UDP-glucose: D: -fructose 2-alpha-D: -glucosyl transferase, EC 2.4.1.13) catalyses the synthesis and cleavage of Suc, and in higher plants, it plays an important role in polysaccharides biosynthesis and carbon allocation. In this work, we have studied the functional relationship between SuS and the metabolism of polysaccharides in filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. We show that the nitrogen and carbon sources and light regulate the expression of the SuS encoding gene (susA), in a similar way that they regulate the accumulation of polysaccharides. Furthermore, glycogen content in an Anabaena sp. mutant strain with an insertion inactivation of susA was lower than in the wild type strain under diazotrophic conditions, while both glycogen and polysaccharides levels were higher in a mutant strain constitutively overexpressing susA. We also show that there are soluble and membrane-bound forms of SuS in Anabaena. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that SuS is involved in the Suc to polysaccharides conversion according to nutritional and environmental signals in filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.
