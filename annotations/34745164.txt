<i>Solanum betaceum</i> is a tree from the Andean region bearing edible fruits, considered an exotic export. Although there has been renewed interest in its commercialization, sustainability, and disease management have been limiting factors. <i>Phytophthora betacei</i> is a recently described species that causes late blight in <i>S. betaceum</i>. There is no general study of the response of <i>S. betaceum</i>, particularly, in the changes in expression of pathogenesis-related genes. In this manuscript we present a comprehensive RNA-seq time-series study of the plant response to the infection of <i>P. betacei</i>. Following six time points of infection, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the defense by the plant were contextualized in a sequential manner. We documented 5,628 DEGs across all time-points. From 6 to 24 h post-inoculation, we highlighted DEGs involved in the recognition of the pathogen by the likely activation of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) genes. We also describe the possible effect of the pathogen effectors in the host during the effector-triggered response. Finally, we reveal genes related to the susceptible outcome of the interaction caused by the onset of necrotrophy and the sharp transcriptional changes as a response to the pathogen. This is the first report of the transcriptome of the tree tomato in response to the newly described pathogen <i>P. betacei.</i>
