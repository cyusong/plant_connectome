Based on our microarray-analysis results of the salt tolerant wheat mutant, RH8706-49, an unknown salt-induced gene containing a conserved DUF662 domain was identified and cloned; we named this gene TaSRG (Triticum aestivum Salt Response Gene). Real-time quantitative PCR analyses showed that the expression of this gene was affected by salt, drought, cold, ABA and other stress conditions. The overexpression of TaSRG in wild-type Arabidopsis resulted in increased salt tolerance compared with wild-type plants. In addition, subcellular localisation revealed that TaSRG encodes a protein that was found mainly in the nucleus. Our results suggest that wheat TaSRG might encode a transcription factor that could be utilised for enhancing stress tolerance in a wide range of plants.
