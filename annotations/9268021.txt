['9268021', 'The ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs) are a class of enzymes vital to the  ubiquitin pathway. These enzymes cleave ubiquitin at its C-terminus from two  types of substrates containing (i) ubiquitin in an alpha-amino linkage, as found  in the primary ubiquitin translation products, polyubiquitin and  ubiquitin-ribosomal fusion proteins, or (ii) ubiquitin in an epsilon-amino  linkage, as found in multiubiquitin chains either unattached or conjugated to  cellular proteins. We have isolated cDNAs for two Arabidopsis thaliana genes,  AtUBP3 and AtUBP4, which encode UBPs that are 93% identical. These two cDNAs  represent the only two members of this subgroup and encode the smallest UBPs  described to date in any organism. Using in vivo assays in Escherichia coli that  allow the coexpression of a UBP with a putative substrate, we have shown that  AtUBP3 and AtUBP4 can specifically deubiquitinate the artificial substrate  Ub-X-beta-gal but cannot act upon the natural alpha-amino-linked ubiquitin  fusions Arabidopsis Ub-CEP52 and Arabidopsis polyubiquitin. Affinity-purified  antibody prepared against AtUBP3 expressed in E. coli recognizes both AtUBP3 and  AtUBP4. AtUBP3 and/or AtUBP4 are present in all Arabidopsis organs examined and  at multiple developmental stages. Subcellular localization studies show that  AtUBP3 and/or AtUBP4 are present in nuclear extracts. Possible physiological  roles for these UBPs are discussed.', '1997 Jul', 'Mol Gen Genet', '10.1007/s004380050501', 'Callis']
