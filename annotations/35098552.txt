Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been used to infer photosynthetic capacity parameters (e.g., the maximum carboxylation rate V<sub>cmax</sub> , and the maximum electron transport rate J<sub>max</sub> ). However, the precise mechanism and practical utility of such approach under dynamic environments remain unclear. We used the balance between the light and carbon reactions to derive theoretical equations relating chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) emission and photosynthetic capacity parameters, and formulated testable hypotheses regarding the dynamic relationships between the true total ChlF emitted from PSII (SIF<sub>PSII</sub> ) and V<sub>cmax</sub> and J<sub>max</sub> . We employed concurrent measurements of gas exchanges and ChlF parameters for 15 species from six biomes to test the formulated hypotheses across species, temperatures, and limitation state of carboxylation. Our results revealed that SIF<sub>PSII</sub> alone is incapable of informing the variations in V<sub>cmax</sub> and J<sub>max</sub> across species, even when SIF<sub>PSII</sub> is determined under the same environmental conditions. In contrast, the product of SIF<sub>PSII</sub> and the fraction of open PSII reactions q<sub>L</sub> , which indicates the redox state of PSII, is a strong predictor of both V<sub>cmax</sub> and J<sub>max</sub> , although their precise relationships vary somewhat with environmental conditions. Our findings suggest the redox state of PSII strongly influences the relationship between SIF<sub>PSII</sub> and V<sub>cmax</sub> and J<sub>max</sub> .
