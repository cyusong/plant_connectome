['29722827', 'The exocyst, a conserved, octameric protein complex, helps mediate secretion at  the plasma membrane, facilitating specific developmental processes that include  control of root meristem size, cell elongation, and tip growth. A genetic screen  for second-site enhancers in Arabidopsis identified NEW ENHANCER of ROOT  DWARFISM1 (NERD1) as an exocyst interactor. Mutations in NERD1 combined with weak  exocyst mutations in SEC8 and EXO70A1 result in a synergistic reduction in root  growth. Alone, nerd1 alleles modestly reduce primary root growth, both by  shortening the root meristem and by reducing cell elongation, but also result in  a slight increase in root hair length, bulging, and rupture. NERD1 was identified  molecularly as At3g51050, which encodes a transmembrane protein of unknown  function that is broadly conserved throughout the Archaeplastida. A functional  NERD1-GFP fusion localizes to the Golgi, in a pattern distinct from the plasma  membrane-localized exocyst, arguing against a direct NERD1-exocyst interaction.  Structural modeling suggests the majority of the protein is positioned in the  lumen, in a beta-propeller-like structure that has some similarity to proteins that  bind polysaccharides. We suggest that NERD1 interacts with the exocyst  indirectly, possibly affecting polysaccharides destined for the cell wall, and  influencing cell wall characteristics in a developmentally distinct manner.', '2018 Jun 27', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ery162', 'Fowler']
