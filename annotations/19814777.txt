The genetic basis of nonhost resistance of barley to nonadapted formae speciales of Blumeria graminis is not known, as there is no barley line that is susceptible to these nonadapted formae speciales, such as the wheat powdery mildew pathogen, Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt). Barley accessions with rudimentary susceptibility to an isolate of the nonadapted Bgt were identified. Those accessions were intercrossed in two cycles and two lines, called SusBgt(SC) and SusBgt(DC), with substantial susceptibility to Bgt at the seedling stage were selected. The quantitative variation among barley accessions and in the progenies after convergent crossing suggests a polygenic basis for this nonhost resistance. Both lines allowed an unusually high level of haustorium formation and colony development by Bgt. The SusBgt lines and their ancestor lines also allowed haustorium formation and conidiation by four out of seven isolates of other nonadapted B. graminis forms. Analysis of the infection process suggested that nonhost resistance factors are specific to the form and developmental stage of B. graminis. Resistances to establishment (first haustorium), colonization (subsequent haustoria) and conidiation are not associated. The lines developed will be of use in elucidating the genetic basis of nonhost resistance to Bgt in barley, and in gene expression and complementation studies on nonhost resistance.
