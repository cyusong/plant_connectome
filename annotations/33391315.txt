['33391315', "Mitochondrial transcription termination factors (mTERFs) are highly conserved  proteins in metazoans. Plants have many more mTERF proteins than animals. The  functions and the underlying mechanisms of plants' mTERFs remain largely unknown.  In plants, mTERF family proteins are present in both mitochondria and plastids  and are involved in gene expression in these organelles through different  mechanisms. In this study, we screened Arabidopsis mutants with pigment-defective  phenotypes and isolated a T-DNA insertion mutant exhibiting seedling-lethal and  albino phenotypes [seedling lethal 1 (sl1)]. The SL1 gene encodes an mTERF  protein localized in the chloroplast stroma. The sl1 mutant showed severe defects  in chloroplast development, photosystem assembly, and the accumulation of  photosynthetic proteins. Furthermore, the transcript levels of some  plastid-encoded proteins were significantly reduced in the mutant, suggesting  that SL1/mTERF3 may function in the chloroplast gene expression. Indeed,  SL1/mTERF3 interacted with PAP12/PTAC7, PAP5/PTAC12, and PAP7/PTAC14 in the  subgroup of DNA/RNA metabolism in the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP)  complex. Taken together, the characterization of the plant chloroplast mTERF  protein, SL1/mTERF3, that associated with PEP complex proteins provided new  insights into RNA transcription in the chloroplast.", '2020', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2020.602782', 'Hou']
