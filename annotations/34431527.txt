Land plants have a unique vascular bundle system that ranges in length from a few centimeters to hundreds of meters. These systems integrate the various organs of the whole plant, perform material exchange between different plant tissues and mediate the transmission of signals between cells or over long distances. Grafting and parasitism can reshape the vascular tissues of different ecotypes or species and represent two important systems for studying plant systemic signaling. In recent years, with the advancement of genomics and sequencing technology, the transportation, identification, and function of systemic plant macromolecules have been extensively studied. Here, we review the current body of knowledge of the transport pathways and regulatory mechanisms of macromolecules in plants and assess systemic, long-distance signal trafficking that mediates stress responses, and plant-environment or plant-insect community interactions. Additionally, we propose several methods for identifying mobile mRNAs and proteins. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing systemic signaling research and put forth the most urgent questions that need to be answered to advance our understanding of plant systemic signaling.
