Little is known about the ecology and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in Arctic ecosystems. Here, the diversity and composition of the AM fungal community and its response to host plant community composition were studied in a low-Arctic meadow habitat. The natural vegetation in two low-Arctic meadow sites was manipulated. Plots with natural vegetation, monoculture and no vegetation were established. Seeds of Solidago virgaurea were sown into the plots and the AM fungal community in the seedling roots was analysed using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) method. The vegetation manipulation treatments affected the community composition but not the diversity of AM fungi found in S. virgaurea roots. The diversity of AM fungi was higher in S. virgaurea roots in the site with naturally higher plant species diversity. These results show that AM fungi in low-Arctic meadows are able to survive for a period of 2 yr without a host plant. This ability buffers the AM fungal community against short-term changes in host plant community composition and diversity.

Vegetation: !affects! AM fungal community
AM fungi: !survive without! host plant
Host plant community: !influences! AM fungal diversity
Host plant diversity: !increases! AM fungal diversity
