The homeostasis of histone methylation is maintained by histone methyltransferases and demethylases, which are important for the regulation of gene expression. Here, we report a histone demethylase from rice (Oryza sativa), Jumonji C domain-containing protein (JMJ710), which belongs to the JMJD6 group and plays an important role in the response to drought stress. Overexpression of JMJ710 causes a drought-sensitive phenotype, while RNAi and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-knockout mutant lines show drought tolerance. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that JMJ710 is a histone demethylase. It targets to MYB TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 48 (MYB48-1) chromatin, demethylates H3K36me2, and negatively regulates the expression of MYB48-1, a positive regulator of drought tolerance. Under drought stress, JMJ710 is downregulated and the expression of MYB48-1 increases, and the subsequent activation of its downstream drought-responsive genes leads to drought tolerance. This research reports a negative regulator of drought stress-responsive genes, JMJ710, that ensures that the drought tolerance mechanism is not mis-activated under normal conditions but allows quick activation upon drought stress.
