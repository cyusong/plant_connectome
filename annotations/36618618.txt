Maize is susceptible to infect pest disease, and early disease detection is key to preventing the reduction of maize yields. The raw data used for plant disease detection are commonly RGB images and hyperspectral images (HSI). RGB images can be acquired rapidly and low-costly, but the detection accuracy is not satisfactory. On the contrary, using HSIs tends to obtain higher detection accuracy, but HSIs are difficult and high-cost to obtain in field. To overcome this contradiction, we have proposed the maize spectral recovery disease detection framework which includes two parts: the maize spectral recovery network based on the advanced hyperspectral recovery convolutional neural network (HSCNN+) and the maize disease detection network based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). Taking raw RGB data as input of the framework, the output reconstructed HSIs are used as input of disease detection network to achieve disease detection task. As a result, the detection accuracy obtained by using the low-cost raw RGB data almost as same as that obtained by using HSIs directly. The HSCNN+ is found to be fit to our spectral recovery model and the reconstruction fidelity was satisfactory. Experimental results demonstrate that the reconstructed HSIs efficiently improve detection accuracy compared with raw RGB image in tested scenarios, especially in complex environment scenario, for which the detection accuracy increases by 6.14%. The proposed framework has the advantages of fast, low cost and high detection precision. Moreover, the framework offers the possibility of real-time and precise field disease detection and can be applied in agricultural robots.
