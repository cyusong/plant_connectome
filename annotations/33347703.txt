['33347703', 'Both plant receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) and ubiquitin-mediated  proteolysis play crucial roles in plant responses to drought stress. However, the  mechanism by which E3 ubiquitin ligases modulate RLKs is poorly understood. In  this study, we showed that Arabidopsis PLANT U-BOX PROTEIN 11 (PUB11), an E3  ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated drought  responses. PUB11 interacts with and ubiquitinates two receptor-like protein  kinases, LEUCINE RICH REPEAT PROTEIN 1 (LRR1) and KINASE 7 (KIN7), and mediates  their degradation during plant responses to drought stress in vitro and in vivo.  pub11 mutants were more tolerant, whereas lrr1 and kin7 mutants were more  sensitive, to drought stress than the wild type. Genetic analyses show that the  pub11 lrr1 kin7 triple mutant exhibited similar drought sensitivity as the lrr1  kin7 double mutant, placing PUB11 upstream of the two RLKs. Abscisic acid and  drought treatment promoted the accumulation of PUB11, which likely accelerates  LRR1 and KIN7 degradation. Together, our results reveal that PUB11 negatively  regulates plant responses to drought stress by destabilizing the LRR1 and KIN7  RLKs.', '2021 Mar', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.13058', 'Gong']
