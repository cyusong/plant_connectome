['16553900', 'HD2 proteins are plant-specific histone deacetylases. Little is known about the  function of HD2 proteins in plants. In this paper, we report that an Arabidopsis  HD2 protein, AtHD2C, is involved in abscisic acid and abiotic stress responses.  Analysis of Arabidopsis plants containing the AtHD2C:beta-glucuronidase fusion  gene revealed that AtHD2C was constitutive expressed in plants. Furthermore,  expression of AtHD2C was repressed by abscisic acid. Over-expression of  35S:AtHD2C-GFP in transgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred an abscisic  acid-insensitive phenotype. In addition, 35S:AtHD2C-GFP transgenic plants  displayed reduced transpiration and enhanced tolerance to salt and drought  stresses when compared with wild-type plants. The expression of several abscisic  acid-responsive genes was affected in the 35S:AtHD2C-GFP plants. Our study  provides evidence indicating that AtHD2C can modulate abscisic acid and stress  responses.', '2006 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02678.x', 'Wu']
