Fruits result from complex biological processes that begin soon after fertilization. Among these processes are cell division and expansion, accumulation of secondary metabolites, and an increase in carbohydrate biosynthesis. Later fruit ripening is accomplished by chlorophyll degradation and cell wall lysis. Fruit maturation is an essential step to optimize seed dispersal, and is controlled by a complex network of transcription factors and genetic regulators that are strongly influenced by phytohormones. Abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene are the major regulators of ripening and senescence in both dry and fleshy fruits, as demonstrated by numerous ripening-defective mutants, effects of exogenous hormone application, and transcriptome analyses. While ethylene is the best characterized player in the final step of a fruit's life, ABA also has a key regulatory role, promoting ethylene production and acting as a stress-related hormone in response to drought and pathogen attack. In this review, we focus on the role of ABA and ethylene in relation to the interconnected biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect ripening and senescence. We integrate and discuss the most recent data available regarding these biological processes, which are crucial for post-harvest fruit conservation and for food safety.
