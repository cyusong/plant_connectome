['25442819', 'BACKGROUND: DUF642 proteins constitute a highly conserved family of proteins that  are associated with the cell wall and are specific to spermatophytes.  Transcriptome studies have suggested that members of this family are involved in  seed development and germination processes. Previous in vitro studies have  revealed that At4g32460- and At5g11420-encoded proteins interact with the  catalytic domain of pectin methyl esterase 3 (AtPME3, which is encoded by  At3g14310). PMEs play an important role in plant development, including seed  germination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the function of the DUF642  gene At4g32460 during seed germination and plant development and to determine its  relation to PME activity regulation. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the  DUF642 proteins encoded by At4g32460 and At5g11420 could be positive regulators  of PME activity during several developmental processes. Transgenic lines  overexpressing these proteins showed increased PME activity during seed  germination, and improved seed germination performance. In plants expressing  At4g32460 antisense RNA, PME activity was decreased in the leaves, and the  siliques were very short and contained no seeds. This phenotype was also present  in the SALK_142260 and SALK_054867 lines for At4g32460. CONCLUSIONS: Our results  suggested that the DUF642 family contributes to the complexity of the  methylesterification process by participating in the fine regulation of pectin  status during plant development.', '2014 Dec 2', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/s12870-014-0338-8', 'Gamboa-deBuen']
