['16815950', 'Histidine (His) is an essential ingredient for protein synthesis and is required  by all living organisms. In higher plants, although there is considerable  evidence that His is essential for plant growth and survival, there is very  little information as to whether it plays any specific role in plant development.  Here, we present evidence for such a role of this amino acid in root development  in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) from the characterization of a novel  Arabidopsis mutant, hpa1, which has a very short root system and carries a  mutation in one of the two Arabidopsis histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase  (HPA) genes, AtHPA1. We have established that AtHPA1 encodes a functional HPA and  that its complete knockout is embryo lethal. Biochemical analysis shows that the  mutation in hpa1 only resulted in a 30% reduction in free His content and had no  significant impact on the total His content. It did not cause any known symptoms  of His starvation. However, the mutant displayed a specific developmental defect  in root meristem maintenance and was unable to sustain primary root growth 2 d  after germination. We have demonstrated that the root meristem failure in the  mutant is tightly linked to the reduction in free His content and could be  rescued by either exogenous His supplementation or AtHPA1 overexpression. Our  results therefore reveal an important role of His homeostasis in plant  development.', '2006 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.084178', 'Wu']
