Knotted1-like Homeobox (KNOX) proteins play important roles in regulating plant growth, development, and other biological processes. However, little information is available on the <i>KNOX</i> gene family in apple (<i>Malus domestica</i> Borkh.). In this study, 22 <i>KNOX</i> genes were identified in the apple genome. The gene structure, protein characteristics, and promoter region were characterized. The <i>MdKNOX</i> family members were divided into three classes based on their phylogenetic relationships. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the majority of <i>MdKNOX</i> genes exhibited strongly preferential expression in buds and were significantly up-regulated during the flower induction period. The transcript levels of <i>MdKNOX</i> genes were responsive to treatments with flowering- and stress-related hormones. The putative upstream regulation factor <i>MdGRF</i> could directly bind to the promoter of <i>MdKNOX15</i> and <i>MdKNOX19</i>, and inhibit their transcriptional activities, which were confirmed by yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays. The results provide an important foundation for future analysis of the regulation and functions of the <i>MdKNOX</i> gene family.
