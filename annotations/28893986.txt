A decrease in the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has been documented by direct observations since 1978 and from ice core measurements since the industrial revolution. This decrease, known as the <sup>13</sup>C-Suess effect, is driven primarily by the input of fossil fuel-derived CO<sub>2</sub> but is also sensitive to land and ocean carbon cycling and uptake. Using updated records, we show that no plausible combination of sources and sinks of CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuel, land, and oceans can explain the observed <sup>13</sup>C-Suess effect unless an increase has occurred in the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C isotopic discrimination of land photosynthesis. A trend toward greater discrimination under higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels is broadly consistent with tree ring studies over the past century, with field and chamber experiments, and with geological records of C<sub>3</sub> plants at times of altered atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, but increasing discrimination has not previously been included in studies of long-term atmospheric <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C measurements. We further show that the inferred discrimination increase of 0.014 ± 0.007‰ ppm<sup>-1</sup> is largely explained by photorespiratory and mesophyll effects. This result implies that, at the global scale, land plants have regulated their stomatal conductance so as to allow the CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure within stomatal cavities and their intrinsic water use efficiency to increase in nearly constant proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.
