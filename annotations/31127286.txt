['31127286', 'SPT6 is a conserved elongation factor that is associated with phosphorylated RNA  polymerase II (RNAPII) during transcription. Recent transcriptome analysis in  yeast mutants revealed its potential role in the control of transcription  initiation at genic promoters. However, the mechanism by which this is achieved  and how this is linked to elongation remains to be elucidated. Here, we present  the genome-wide occupancy of Arabidopsis SPT6-like (SPT6L) and demonstrate its  conserved role in facilitating RNAPII occupancy across transcribed genes. We also  further demonstrate that SPT6L enrichment is unexpectedly shifted, from gene body  to transcription start site (TSS), when its association with RNAPII is disrupted.  Protein domains, required for proper function and enrichment of SPT6L on  chromatin, are subsequently identified. Finally, our results suggest that  recruitment of SPT6L at TSS is indispensable for its spreading along the gene  body during transcription. These findings provide new insights into the  mechanisms underlying SPT6L recruitment in transcription and shed light on the  coordination between transcription initiation and elongation.', '2019 Jul 26', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkz465', 'Cui']
