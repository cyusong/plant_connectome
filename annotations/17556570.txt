Shipley et al. (Reports, 3 November 2006, p. 812) predicted plant community composition and relative abundances with a high level of accuracy by maximizing Shannon's index of information entropy (species diversity), subject to constraints on plant trait averages. We show that the entropy maximization assumption is relatively unimportant and that the high accuracy is due largely to a statistical effect.

Gene: !affects! Plant community composition 
Gene: !affects! Relative abundances 
Gene: !maximizes! Shannon's index of information entropy 
Gene: !constrains! Plant trait averages
