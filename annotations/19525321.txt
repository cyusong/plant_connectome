['19525321', 'Suberin composition of various plants including Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) has shown the presence of very long chain fatty acid derivatives C20 in  addition to the C16 and C18 series. Phylogenetic studies and plant genome mining  have led to the identification of putative aliphatic hydroxylases belonging to  the CYP86B subfamily of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. In Arabidopsis, this  subfamily is represented by CYP86B1 and CYP86B2, which share about 45% identity  with CYP86A1, a fatty acid omega-hydroxylase implicated in root suberin monomer  synthesis. Here, we show that CYP86B1 is located to the endoplasmic reticulum and  is highly expressed in roots. Indeed, CYP86B1 promoter-driven beta-glucuronidase  expression indicated strong reporter activities at known sites of suberin  production such as the endodermis. These observations, together with the fact  that proteins of the CYP86B type are widespread among plant species, suggested a  role of CYP86B1 in suberin biogenesis. To investigate the involvement of CYP86B1  in suberin biogenesis, we characterized an allelic series of cyp86B1 mutants of  which two strong alleles were knockouts and two weak ones were RNA  interference-silenced lines. These root aliphatic plant hydroxylase lines had a  root and a seed coat aliphatic polyester composition in which C22- and  C24-hydroxyacids and alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acids were strongly reduced.  However, these changes did not affect seed coat permeability and ion content in  leaves. The presumed precursors, C22 and C24 fatty acids, accumulated in the  suberin polyester. These results demonstrate that CYP86B1 is a very long chain  fatty acid hydroxylase specifically involved in polyester monomer biosynthesis  during the course of plant development.', '2009 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.141408', 'Pinot']
