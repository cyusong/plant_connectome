['9636070', 'The study of cell division control within developing tissues is central to  understanding the processes of pattern formation. The floral meristem of  angiosperms gives rise to floral organs in a particular number and pattern.  Despite its critical role, little is known about how cell division is controlled  in the floral meristem, and few genes involved have been identified. We describe  the phenotypic effects of mutations in WIGGUM, a gene required for control of  cell proliferation in the floral and apical meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana.  wiggum flowers contain more organs, especially sepals and petals, than found in  wild-type flowers. This organ number phenotype correlates with specific size  changes in the early floral meristem, preceding organ initiation. Genetic studies  suggest that WIGGUM acts on a similar process but in a separate pathway than the  CLAVATA1 and CLAVATA3 genes in meristem size regulation, and reveal interactions  with other genes affecting meristem structure and identity. Analysis of double  mutant phenotypes also reveals a role for WIGGUM in apical meristem function. We  propose that WIGGUM plays a role in restricting cell division relative to  cellular differentiation in specific regions of the apical and floral meristems.', '1998 Jul', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.125.14.2545', 'Meyerowitz']
