['23935008', 'The zinc-finger protein STOP1 (sensitive to proton rhizotoxicity 1) regulates  transcription of multiple genes critical for tolerance to aluminum (Al) and low  pH in Arabidopsis. We evaluated the contributions of genes that are suppressed in  the stop1 mutant to Al- and low pH-tolerance using T-DNA-inserted disruptants,  and transgenic stop1 mutants expressing each of the suppressed genes. STOP2, a  STOP1 homolog, partially recovered Al- and low pH-tolerance by recovering the  expression of genes regulated by STOP1. Growth and root tip viability under  proton stress were partially rescued in the STOP2-complemented line. STOP2  localized in the nucleus and regulated transcription of two genes (PGIP1 and  PGIP2) associated with cell wall stabilization at low pH. GUS assays revealed  that STOP1 and STOP2 showed similar cellular expression in the root. However, the  expression level of STOP2 was much lower than that of STOP1. In a STOP1  promoter::STOP2-complemented line, Al tolerance was slightly recovered,  concomitant with the recovery of expression of ALS3 (aluminum sensitive 3) and  AtMATE (Arabidopsis thaliana multidrug and toxic compound extrusion), while the  expression of AtALMT1 (aluminum-activated malate transporter 1) was not  recovered. These analyses indicated that STOP2 is a physiologically minor isoform  of STOP1, but it can activate expression of some genes regulated by STOP1.', '2014 Feb', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/sst116', 'Koyama']
