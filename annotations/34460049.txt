Overexpressing Nicotinamidase 3 gene, and the exogenous application of its metabolite nicotinic acid (NA), enhance drought stress tolerance and increase biomass in Arabidopsis thaliana. With progressive global climatic changes, plant productivity is threatened severely by drought stress. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms regarding genes responsible for balancing plant growth and stress amelioration could imply multiple possibilities for future sustainable goals. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis and recycling/ distribution is a crucial feature for plant growth. The current study focuses on the functional characterization of nicotinamidase 3 (NIC3) gene, which is involved in the biochemical conversion of nicotinamide (NAM) to nicotinic acid (NA) in the salvage pathway of NAD biosynthesis. Our data show that overexpression of NIC3 gene enhances drought stress tolerance and increases plant growth. NIC3-OX plants accumulated more NA as compared to WT plants. Moreover, the upregulation of several genes related to plant growth/stress tolerance indicates that regulating the NAD salvage pathway could significantly enhance plant growth and drought stress tolerance. The exogenous application of nicotinic acid (NA) showed a similar phenotype as the effect of overexpressing NIC3 gene. In short, we contemplated the role of NIC3 gene and NA application in drought stress tolerance and plant growth. Our results would be helpful in engineering plants with enhanced drought stress tolerance and increased growth potential.
