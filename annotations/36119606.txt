['36119606', "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the rate-limiting enzyme of the oxidative  pentose-phosphate pathway (OPPP). The OPPP mainly provides NADPH and  sugar-phosphate building blocks for anabolic pathways and is present in all  eukaryotes. In plant cells, the irreversible part of the OPPP is found in several  compartments. Among the isoforms catalyzing the first OPPP step in Arabidopsis,  G6PD1 to G6PD4 target plastids (with G6PD1 being also directed to peroxisomes),  whereas G6PD5 and G6PD6 operate in the cytosol. We noticed that alternative  splice forms G6PD5.4 and G6PD5.5 encode N-terminally extended proteoforms.  Compared to G6PD5.1, RT-PCR signals differed and fluorescent reporter fusions  expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts accumulated in distinct intracellular sites.  Co-expression with organelle-specific markers revealed that the G6PD5.4 and  G6PD5.5 proteoforms label different subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),  and analysis of C-terminal roGFP fusions showed that their catalytic domains face  the cytosol. In g6pd5-1 g6pd6-2 mutant protoplasts lacking cytosolic G6PDH  activity, the ER-bound proteoforms were both active and thus able to form  homomers. Among the Arabidopsis 6-phosphogluconolactonases (catalyzing the second  OPPP step), we noticed that isoform PGL2 carries a C-terminal CaaX motif that may  be prenylated for membrane attachment. Reporter-PGL2 fusions co-localized with  G6PD5.4 in ER subdomains, which was abolished by Cys-to-Ser exchange in the  (256)CSIL motif. Among the Arabidopsis 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases  (catalyzing the third OPPP step), S-acylated peptides were detected for all three  isoforms in a recent palmitoylome, with dual cytosolic/peroxisomal PGD2  displaying three sites. Co-expression of GFP-PGD2 diminished crowding of  OFP-G6PD5.4 at the ER, independent of PGL2's presence. Upon pull-down of  GFP-G6PD5.4, not only unlabeled PGD2 and PGL2 were enriched, but also enzymes  that depend on NADPH provision at the ER, indicative of physical interaction with  the OPPP enzymes. When membrane-bound G6PD5.5 and 5.4 variants were co-expressed  with KCR1 (ketoacyl-CoA reductase, involved in fatty acid elongation), ATR1  (NADPH:cytochrome-P450 oxidoreductase), or pulled C4H/CYP73A5 (cinnamate  4-hydroxylase) as indirectly (via ATR) NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 enzyme,  co-localization in ER subdomains was observed. Thus, alternative splicing of  G6PD5 can direct the NADPH-producing OPPP reactions to the cytosolic face of the  ER, where they may operate as membrane-bound metabolon to support several  important biosynthetic pathways of plant cells.", '2022', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2022.909624', 'von']
