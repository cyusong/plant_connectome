Leaf senescence is an organized process, which requires fine tuning between nuclear gene expression, activity of proteases and the maintenance of primary metabolism. Recently, we reported that leaf senescence was accompanied by an early degradation of the microtubule cytoskeleton in Arabidopsis thaliana. As the cytoskeleton is essential for cell stability, vesicle shuttling and organelle mobility, it might be asked how the regulation of these cell functions occurs with such drastic modifications of the cytoskeleton. Based on confocal laser microscopy observations and a micro-array analysis, the following addendum shows that mitochondrial mobility is conserved until the late stages of leaf senescence and provides evidences that the actin-cytoskeleton is maintained longer than the microtubule network. This conservation of actin-filaments is discussed with regards to energy metabolism as well as calcium signaling during programmed cell death.
