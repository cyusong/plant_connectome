Sinorhizobium meliloti cells were engineered to overexpress Anabaena variabilis flavodoxin, a protein that is involved in the response to oxidative stress. Nodule natural senescence was characterized in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) plants nodulated by the flavodoxin-overexpressing rhizobia or the corresponding control bacteria. The decline of nitrogenase activity and the nodule structural and ultrastructural alterations that are associated with nodule senescence were significantly delayed in flavodoxin-expressing nodules. Substantial changes in nodule antioxidant metabolism, involving antioxidant enzymes and ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes and metabolites, were detected in flavodoxin-containing nodules. Lipid peroxidation was also significantly lower in flavodoxin-expressing nodules than in control nodules. The observed amelioration of the oxidative balance suggests that the delay in nodule senescence was most likely due to a role of the protein in reactive oxygen species detoxification. Flavodoxin overexpression also led to high starch accumulation in nodules, without reduction of the nitrogen-fixing activity.
