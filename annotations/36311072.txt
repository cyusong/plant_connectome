Histone posttranslational modifications shape the chromatin landscape of the plant genome and affect gene expression in response to developmental and environmental cues. To date, the role of histone modifications in regulating plant responses to environmental nutrient availability, especially in agriculturally important species, remains largely unknown. We describe the functions of two histone lysine methyltransferases, SET Domain Group 33 (SDG33) and SDG34, in mediating nitrogen (N) responses of shoots and roots in tomato. By comparing the transcriptomes of CRISPR edited tomato lines <i>sdg33</i> and <i>sdg34</i> with wild-type plants under N-supplied and N-starved conditions, we uncovered that SDG33 and SDG34 regulate overlapping yet distinct downstream gene targets. In response to N level changes, both SDG33 and SDG34 mediate gene regulation in an organ-specific manner: in roots, SDG33 and SDG34 regulate a gene network including <i>Nitrate Transporter 1.1</i> (<i>NRT1.1</i>) and <i>Small Auxin Up-regulated RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes. In agreement with this, mutations in <i>sdg33</i> or <i>sdg34</i> abolish the root growth response triggered by an N-supply; In shoots, SDG33 and SDG34 affect the expression of photosynthesis genes and photosynthetic parameters in response to N. Our analysis thus revealed that SDG33 and SDG34 regulate N-responsive gene expression and physiological changes in an organ-specific manner, thus presenting previously unknown candidate genes as targets for selection and engineering to improve N uptake and usage in crop plants.
