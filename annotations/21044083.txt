Cysteine proteases (CPs) with N-succinyl-Leu-Tyr-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Suc-LY-MCA) cleavage activity were investigated in green and senescent leaves of spinach. The enzyme activity was separated into two major and several faint minor peaks by hydrophobic chromatography. These peaks were conventionally designated as CP1, CP2 and CP3, according to their order of elution. From the analyses of molecular mass, subunit structure, amino acid sequences and cDNA cloning, CP2 was a monomer complex (SoCP-CPI) (51 kDa) composed of a 41-kDa core protein, SoCP (Spinacia oleracea cysteine protease), and 14-kDa cystatin, a cysteine protease inhibitor (CPI), while CP3 was a trimer complex (SoCP-CPI)(3) (151 kDa) of the same subunits as SoCP-CPI and showed a wider range of specificity toward natural substrates than SoCP-CPI. Trimer (SoCP-CPI)(3) was irreversibly formed from monomers through association. The results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that mRNAs of CPI and SoCP are hardly expressed in green leaves, but they are coordinately expressed in senescent leaves, suggesting that these proteases involve in senescence. Purified recombinant CPI had strong inhibitory activity against trimer SoCP, (SoCP)(3) , which had a cystatin deleted with K(i) value of 1.33 × 10(-9) M. After treatment of the enzyme with a succinate buffer (pH 5) at the most active pH of the enzyme, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and activity analyses showed that cystatin was released from both monomer SoCP-CPI and trimer (SoCP-CPI)(3) complexes with a concomitant activation. Thus, the removal of a cystatin is necessary to activate the enzyme activity.
