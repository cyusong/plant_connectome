Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) as a universal signal molecule plays pivotal roles in plant growth and development. It regulates root morphogenesis mainly through mediating phytohormone and stress signalings or affecting these signalings. In recent years, much progress has been made in understanding the roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in primary root development. Here, we summarize recent advances in the functions and mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in modulating primary root growth in plants under normal and stressful conditions.
