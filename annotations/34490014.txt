Ectomycorrhizal fungi establish a mutualistic symbiosis in roots of most woody plants. The molecular underpinning of ectomycorrhizal development was only explored in a few lineages. Here, we characterized the symbiotic transcriptomes of several milkcap species (<i>Lactarius</i>, Russulales) in association with different pine hosts. A time-course study of changes in gene expression during the development of <i>L. deliciosus-Pinus taeda</i> symbiosis identified 6 to 594 differentially expressed fungal genes at various developmental stages. Up- or down-regulated genes are involved in signaling pathways, nutrient transport, cell wall modifications, and plant defenses. A high number of genes coding for secreted proteases, especially sedolisins, were induced during root colonization. In contrast, only a few genes encoding mycorrhiza-induced small secreted proteins were identified. This feature was confirmed in several other <i>Lactarius</i> species in association with various pines. Further comparison among all these species revealed that each <i>Lactarius</i> species encodes a highly specific symbiotic gene repertoire, a feature possibly related to their host-specificity. This study provides insights on the genetic basis of symbiosis in an ectomycorrhizal order, the Russulales, which was not investigated so far.
