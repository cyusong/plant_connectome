Accumulated evidence indicates that ROS fluctuations play a critical role in cell division. Dividing plant cells rapidly respond to them. Experimental disturbance of ROS homeostasis affects: tubulin polymerization; PPB, mitotic spindle and phragmoplast assembly; nuclear envelope dynamics; chromosome separation and movement; cell plate formation. Dividing cells mainly accumulate at prophase and delay in passing through the successive cell division stages. Notably, many dividing root cells of the rhd2 Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, lacking the RHD2/AtRBOHC protein function, displayed aberrations, comparable to those induced by low ROS levels. Some protein molecules, playing key roles in signal transduction networks inducing ROS production, participate in cell division. NADPH oxidases and their regulators PLD, PI3K and ROP-GTPases, are involved in MT polymerization and organization. Cellular ROS oscillations function as messages rapidly transmitted through MAPK pathways inducing MAP activation, thus affecting MT dynamics and organization. RNS implication in cell division is also considered.
