SARD1 and CBP60g are two master regulators in plant immunity. They are required for the constitutive defense responses in the Arabidopsis <i>snc2-1D</i> mutant, which carries a gain-of-function mutation in a receptor-like protein. Here we report that WRKY54 and WRKY70 are required for activation of <i>SARD1</i> and <i>CBP60g</i> expression and defense responses in <i>snc2-1D</i>. In addition, the induction of <i>SARD1</i> and <i>CBP60g</i> by the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>maculicola</i> is significantly reduced in <i>sid2 wrky54 wrky70</i> triple mutants compared to the <i>sid2</i> single mutants, suggesting that WRKY54 and WRKY70 positively regulate the <i>SID2</i>-independent expression of <i>SARD1</i> and <i>CBP60g</i> during pathogen infection. Our study revealed WRKY54 and WRKY70 as positive regulators of <i>SARD1</i> and <i>CBP60g</i> expression in plant defense.
