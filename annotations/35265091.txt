Although etiolated <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> seedlings are widely used as a model to study the de-etiolation process, the etiolation itself at the molecular level still needs elucidation. Here, we monitored the etiolation dynamics for wild type <i>A. thaliana</i> seedlings and lutein-deficient (<i>lut2</i>) mutant between 2 and 12 days of their growth in the absence of light. We analyzed the shape of the apex, the growth rate, the carotenoids and protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) accumulation, and the light-dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (<i>LPOR</i>) transcripts. Differences concerning the apical hook curvature and cotyledon opening among seedlings of the same age were observed, mostly after day 6 of the culture. We categorized the observed apex shapes and presented quantitatively how distribution among the categories changed during 12 days of seedling growth. The Pchlide<sub>654</sub>/Pchlide<sub>633</sub> ratio, corresponding to the amount of the photoactive Pchlide, was the highest in the youngest seedlings, and decreased with their age. <i>LPORA</i>, <i>LPORB</i>, and <i>LPORC</i> transcripts were detected in etiolated seedlings, and their content decreased during seedling growth. Expression of <i>SAG12</i> or <i>SAG13</i> senescence markers, depletion in antioxidants, and excess ion leakage were not observed during the etiolation. Lack of lutein in the <i>lut2</i> mutant resulted in slow Pchlide accumulation and affected other xanthophyll composition.
