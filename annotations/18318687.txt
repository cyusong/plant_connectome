['18318687', 'MSH5, a meiosis-specific member of the MutS-homologue family of genes, is  required for normal levels of recombination in budding yeast, mouse and  Caenorhabditis elegans. In this paper we report the identification and  characterization of the Arabidopsis homologue of MSH5 (AtMSH5). Transcripts of  AtMSH5 are specific to reproductive tissues, and immunofluorescence studies  indicate that expression of the protein is abundant during prophase I of meiosis.  In a T-DNA tagged insertional mutant (Atmsh5-1), recombination is reduced to  about 13% of wild-type levels. The residual chiasmata are randomly distributed  between cells and chromosomes. These data provide further evidence for at least  two pathways of meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis and indicate that AtMSH5  protein is required for the formation of class I interference-sensitive  crossovers. Localization of AtMSH5 to meiotic chromosomes occurs at leptotene and  is dependent on DNA double-strand break formation and strand exchange.  Localization of AtMSH5 to the chromatin at mid-prophase I is dependent on  expression of AtMSH4. At late zygotene/early pachytene a proportion of AtMSH5  foci co-localize with AtMLH1 which marks crossover-designated sites. Chromosome  synapsis appears to proceed normally, without significant delay, in Atmsh5-1 but  the pachytene stage is extended by several hours, indicative of the operation of  a surveillance system that monitors the progression of prophase I.', '2008 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03470.x', 'Jones']
