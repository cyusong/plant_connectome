PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) genes encode phosphate (Pi) transporters that play a fundamental role in Pi acquisition and remobilization in plants. Mutation of the Arabidopsis thaliana PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (PHF1) impairs Pi transport, resulting in the constitutive expression of many Pi starvation-induced genes, increased arsenate resistance, and reduced Pi accumulation. PHF1 expression was detected in all tissues, particularly in roots, flowers, and senescing leaves, and was induced by Pi starvation, thus mimicking the expression patterns of the whole PHT1 gene family. PHF1 was localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mutation of PHF1 resulted in ER retention and reduced accumulation of the plasma membrane PHT1;1 transporter. By contrast, the PIP2A plasma membrane protein was not mislocalized, and the secretion of Pi starvation-induced RNases was not affected in the mutant. PHF1 encodes a plant-specific protein structurally related to the SEC12 proteins of the early secretory pathway. However, PHF1 lacks most of the conserved residues in SEC12 proteins essential as guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Although it functions in early secretory trafficking, PHF1 likely evolved a novel mechanism accompanying functional specialization on Pi transporters. The identification of PHF1 reveals that plants are also endowed with accessory proteins specific for selected plasma membrane proteins, allowing their exit from the ER, and that these ER exit cofactors may have a phylum-specific origin.
