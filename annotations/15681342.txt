['15681342', 'Brassinosteroid (BR) homeostasis and signaling are crucial for normal growth and  development of plants. BR signaling through cell-surface receptor kinases and  intracellular components leads to dephosphorylation and accumulation of the  nuclear protein BZR1. How BR signaling regulates gene expression, however,  remains unknown. Here we show that BZR1 is a transcriptional repressor that has a  previously unknown DNA binding domain and binds directly to the promoters of  feedback-regulated BR biosynthetic genes. Microarray analyses identified  additional potential targets of BZR1 and illustrated, together with physiological  studies, that BZR1 coordinates BR homeostasis and signaling by playing dual roles  in regulating BR biosynthesis and downstream growth responses.', '2005 Mar 11', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1107580', 'Wang']
