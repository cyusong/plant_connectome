['25701405', 'Plant peptides play important roles in various aspects of plant growth and  development. The RTFL/DVL family includes small peptides that are widely  conserved among land plants. Overexpression of six RTFL genes in Arabidopsis was  suggestive of their functions as negative regulators of cell proliferation and as  positional cues along the longitudinal axis of the plant body . At this time, few  reports are available on RTFL paralogs in other species and the evolutionary  relationship of RTFL members among land plants remains unclear. In this study, we  compared and analyzed whole amino acid sequences of 188 RTFL members from 22  species among land plants and identified 73 motifs. All RTFL members could be  grouped into four clades, and each clade exhibited specific motif patterns,  indicative of unique evolutionary traits in the RTFL family. In agreement with  this hypothesis, we analyzed two RTFL members from Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis  by overexpressing them in Arabidopsis, revealing similar phenotypes suggestive of  a conserved function of the RTFL family between eudicots and monocots, as well as  different phenotypes and unique functions.', '2015 May', 'J Plant Res', '10.1007/s10265-015-0703-1', 'Tsukaya']
