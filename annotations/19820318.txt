Jasmonate signaling plays a critical role in protecting plants from pathogens or insect attacks and in limiting damage from abiotic stress. Many events contribute to the regulation of jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis during abiotic or biotic stress, but the details of the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this Mini-Review paper, we discuss the possible roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), calcium influx and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade during JA synthesis or JA signal transduction.

ROS: !affects! JA synthesis
NO: !affects! JA synthesis
Calcium influx: !affects! JA synthesis
MAPK cascade: !affects! JA synthesis
JA synthesis: !regulates! JA signal transduction
