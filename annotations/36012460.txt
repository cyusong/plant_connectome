In the wake of changing climatic conditions, plants are frequently exposed to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses at various stages of their development, all of which negatively affect their growth, development, and productivity. Drought is one of the most devastating abiotic stresses for most cultivated crops, particularly in arid and semiarid environments. Conventional breeding and biotechnological approaches are used to generate drought-tolerant crop plants. However, these techniques are costly and time-consuming. Plant-colonizing microbes, notably, endophytic fungi, have received increasing attention in recent years since they can boost plant growth and yield and can strengthen plant responses to abiotic stress. In this review, we describe these microorganisms and their relationship with host plants, summarize the current knowledge on how they "reprogram" the plants to promote their growth, productivity, and drought tolerance, and explain why they are promising agents in modern agriculture.
