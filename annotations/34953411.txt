Spatiotemporal cues orchestrate the development of organs and cellular differentiation in multicellular organisms. For instance, in the root apical meristem an auxin gradient patterns the transition from stem cell maintenance to transit amplification and eventual differentiation. Among the proximal tissues generated by this growth apex, the early, so-called protophloem, is the first tissue to differentiate. This observation has been linked to increased auxin activity in the developing protophloem sieve element cell files as compared to the neighboring tissues. Here we review recent progress in the characterization of the unique mechanism by which auxin canalizes its activity in the developing protophloem and fine-tunes its own transport to guide proper timing of protophloem sieve element differentiation.
