Flower development and fertility are coordinately regulated by endogenous developmental signals, including the phytohormones jasmonates (JAs), auxin, and gibberellin, and environmental cues. JAs regulate stamen development and fertility under basal conditions, affect root growth and trichome formation under stress conditions, and control defense responses against insect herbivores and pathogens. Since the 1990s, an increasing number of studies have revealed the essential roles of JA biosynthesis, signaling, and crosstalk in regulation of flower development and fertility. Here, we summarize and present an updated overview of the JA pathway and its crosstalk in modulating flower/sexual organ development and fertility in Arabidopsis, tomato, rice, maize, and sorghum.

JAs: !regulate! stamen development and fertility
JAs: !affect! root growth and trichome formation
JAs: !control! defense responses
JA biosynthesis: !regulates! flower/sexual organ development and fertility
JA signaling: !regulates! flower/sexual organ development and fertility
JA crosstalk: !modulates! flower/sexual organ development and fertility
