Potassium (K(+)) is an essential nutrient for plants which is acquired by plant roots through the operation of specific transport systems. Abiotic stress conditions such as salinity impair K(+) nutrition because, in addition to other effects, high salt concentrations in the solution bathing the roots inhibit K(+) uptake systems. This detrimental effect of salinity is exacerbated when external K(+) is very low and the only system capable of mediating K(+) uptake is one with high-affinity for K(+), as that mediated by transporters of the HAK5 type. Increasing external Ca(2+) has been shown to improve K(+) nutrition under salinity and, although the specific mechanisms for this beneficial effect are largely unknown, they are beginning to be understood. The genes encoding the HAK5 transporters are induced by K(+) starvation and repressed by long-term exposure to high Na(+). This occurs in parallel with the hyperpolarization and depolarization of root cell membrane potential. In the present study it is shown in tomato plants that the presence of high Ca(2+) during the K(+) starvation period that leads to LeHAK5 induction, counteracts the repression exerted by high Na(+). High Ca(2+) reduces the Na(+)-induced plasma membrane depolarization of root cells, resorting one of the putative first steps in the low-K(+) signal cascade. This allows proper LeHAK5 expression and functional high-affinity K(+) uptake at the roots. Thus, the maintenance of HAK5-mediated K(+) nutrition under salinity by high Ca(2+) can be regarded as a specific beneficial effect of Ca(2+) contributing to salt tolerance in plants.
