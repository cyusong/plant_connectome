Over 160 years ago, scientists made the first microscopic observations of angiosperm pollen. Unlike in animals, male meiosis in angiosperms produces a haploid microspore that undergoes one asymmetric division to form a vegetative cell and a generative cell. These two cells have distinct fates: the vegetative cell exits the cell cycle and elongates to form a tip-growing pollen tube; the generative cell divides once more in the pollen grain or within the growing pollen tube to form a pair of sperm cells. The concept that male germ cells are less active than the vegetative cell came from biochemical analyses and pollen structure anatomy early in the last century and is supported by the pollen transcriptome data of the last decade. However, the mechanism of how and when the transcriptional repression in male germ cells occurs is still not fully understood. In this review, we provide a brief account of the cytological and metabolic differentiation between the vegetative cell and male germ cells, with emphasis on the role of temporary callose walls, dynamic nuclear pore density, transcription repression, and histone variants. We further discuss the intercellular movement of small interfering RNA (siRNA) derived from transposable elements (TEs) and reexamine the function of TE expression in male germ cells.
