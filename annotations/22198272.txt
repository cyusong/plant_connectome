['22198272', 'Clade A protein phosphatases type 2C (PP2Cs) are negative regulators of abscisic  acid (ABA) signaling that are inhibited in an ABA-dependent manner by PYRABACTIN  RESISTANCE1 (PYR1)/PYR1-LIKE (PYL)/REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS (RCAR)  intracellular receptors. We provide genetic evidence that a previously  uncharacterized member of this PP2C family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana),  At5g59220, is a negative regulator of osmotic stress and ABA signaling and that  this function was only apparent when double loss-of-function mutants with  pp2ca-1/ahg3 were generated. At5g59220-green fluorescent protein and its close  relative PP2CA-green fluorescent protein showed a predominant nuclear  localization; however, hemagglutinin-tagged versions were also localized to  cytosol and microsomal pellets. At5g59220 was selectively inhibited by some  PYR/PYL ABA receptors, and close relatives of this PP2C, such as  PP2CA/ABA-HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION3 (AHG3) and AHG1, showed a contrasting  sensitivity to PYR/PYL inhibition. Interestingly, AHG1 was resistant to  inhibition by the PYR/PYL receptors tested, which suggests that this  seed-specific phosphatase is still able to regulate ABA signaling in the presence  of ABA and PYR/PYL receptors and therefore to control the highly active ABA  signaling pathway that operates during seed development. Moreover, the  differential sensitivity of the phosphatases At5g59220 and PP2CA to inhibition by  ABA receptors reveals a functional specialization of PYR/PYL ABA receptors to  preferentially inhibit certain PP2Cs.', '2012 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.188623', 'Rodriguez']
