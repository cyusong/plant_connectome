['9724691', 'Recognition of pathogens by plants is mediated by several distinct families of  functionally variable but structurally related disease resistance (R) genes. The  largest family is defined by the presence of a putative nucleotide binding domain  and 12 to 21 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). The function of these LRRs has not been  defined, but they are speculated to bind pathogen-derived ligands. We have  isolated a mutation in the Arabidopsis RPS5 gene that indicates that the LRR  region may interact with other plant proteins. The rps5-1 mutation causes a  glutamate-to-lysine substitution in the third LRR and partially compromises the  function of several R genes that confer bacterial and downy mildew resistance.  The third LRR is relatively well conserved, and we speculate that it may interact  with a signal transduction component shared by multiple R gene pathways.', '1998 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.9.1439', 'Innes']
