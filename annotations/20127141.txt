The Streptomyces phage phiC31 integrase was tested for its ability to excise transgenic DNA from the wheat genome by site-specific recombination. Plants that stably express phiC31 integrase were crossed to plants carrying a target construct bearing the phiC31 recognition sites, attP and attB. In the progeny, phiC31 recombinase mediates recombination between the att sites of the target locus, which results in excision of the intervening DNA. Recombination events could be identified in 34 independent wheat lines by PCR and Southern blot analysis and by sequencing of the excision footprints. Recombinant loci were inherited to the subsequent generation. The results presented here establish the integrase-att system as a tool for catalysing the precise elimination of DNA sequences from wheat chromosomes.
