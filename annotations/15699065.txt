Both woody and herbaceous plant species are known to respond to wind loading, with consequences for growth and morphology. Wind has usually been classified as a mechanical stress which is detrimental to plant growth. Few experiments exist whereby plants and, in particular, woody species are exposed to wind, as opposed to mechanical perturbation by touching, flexing or shaking. Such experiments have always been short term and often carried out in wind tunnels in a controlled greenhouse environment. This study introduces an experiment to test the responses of Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aït.) seedlings to recurrent and short wind loading in the field, over two growing seasons. These experiments provide evidence that periodic short-term exposure to wind can induce phototropic responses in the early stage of pine seedlings' development. An interpretation is proposed in terms of efficiency to light tracking and hypotheses are discussed concerning the underlying physiological process.
