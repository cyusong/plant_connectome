['18003921', 'The MYB-related gene ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 (AS1) and its orthologs have an  evolutionarily conserved role in specification of leaf cell identity. AS1 is  expressed in leaf founder cells, where it functions as a heterodimer with the  structurally unrelated AS2 proteins to repress activity of KNOTTED 1-like  homeobox (KNOX) genes. AS1 therefore confines KNOX activity to the shoot apical  meristem, where it promotes stem cell function through the regulation of  phytohormone activities. Here, we show that loss-of-function mutations in AS1  unexpectedly convey heightened protection against necrotrophic fungi. AS1  operates as a negative regulator of inducible resistance against these pathogens  by selectively binding to the promoters of genes controlled by the immune  activator, jasmonic acid (JA), damping the defense response. In contrast, AS1 is  a positive regulator of salicylic acid (SA)-independent extracellular defenses  against bacterial pathogens. Neither the absence of AS2 nor ERECTA function,  which enhances the morphological phenotype of as1, nor the conditional or  constitutive expression of KNOX genes impacted disease resistance. Thus, the  function of AS1 in responses to phytopathogens is independent of its  AS2-associated role in development. Loss of function in the AS1 orthologs PHAN in  Antirrhinum majus and NSPHAN in Nicotiana sylvestris produced pathogen-response  phenotypes similar to as1 plants, and therefore the defense function of AS1 is  evolutionarily conserved in plant species with a divergence time of approximately  125 million years.', '2007 Nov 20', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0705586104', 'Loake']
