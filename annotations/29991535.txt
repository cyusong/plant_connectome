['29991535', 'Fast tip-growing plant cells such as pollen tubes (PTs) and root hairs (RHs)  require a robust coordination between their internal growth machinery and  modifications of their extracellular rigid, yet extensible, cell wall (CW). Part  of this essential coordination is governed by members of the Catharanthus roseus  receptor-like kinase1-like (CrRLK1L) subfamily of RLKs with FERONIA (FER) and its  closest homologs, ANXUR1 (ANX1) and ANX2, controlling CW integrity during RH and  PT growth, respectively. Recently, Leucine-Rich Repeat Extensin 8 (LRX8) to LRX11  were also shown to be important for CW integrity in PTs. We previously reported  an anx1 anx2 suppressor screen in Arabidopsis thaliana that revealed MARIS (MRI)  as a positive regulator of both FER- and ANX1/2-dependent CW integrity pathways.  Here, we characterize a suppressor that exhibits a weak rescue of the anx1 anx2  PT bursting phenotype and a short RH phenotype. The corresponding suppressor  mutation causes a D94N substitution in a Type One Protein Phosphatase we named  ATUNIS1 (AUN1). We show that AUN1 and its closest homolog, AUN2, are  nucleocytoplasmic negative regulators of tip growth. Moreover, we demonstrate  that AUN1(D94N) and AUN1(H127A) harboring mutations in key amino acids of the  conserved catalytic site of phosphoprotein phosphatases function as dominant  amorphic variants that repress PT growth. Finally, genetic interaction studies  using the hypermorph MRI(R240C) and amorph AUN1(D94N) dominant variants indicate  that LRX8-11 and ANX1/2 function in distinct but converging pathways to fine-tune  CW integrity during tip growth.', '2018 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00284', 'ORCID:']
