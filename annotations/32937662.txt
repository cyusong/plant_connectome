Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in plant abiotic stress responses, but the response of lncRNA-mediated genetic networks to cadmium (Cd) treatment remain elusive in trees, the promising candidates for phytoremediation of Cd contamination. We identified 172 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 295 differentially expressed target genes in the leaves of Cd-treated Populus tomentosa. Functional annotation revealed that these lncRNAs were involved in various processes, including photosynthesis, hormone regulation, and phenylalanine metabolism. Association studies identified 78 significant associations, representing 14 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 28 target genes for photosynthetic and leaf physiological traits. Epistasis uncovered 83 pairwise interactions among these traits, revealing Cd-responsive lncRNA-mediated genetic networks for photosynthesis and leaf physiology in P. tomentosa. We focused on the roles of two Cd-responsive lncRNA-gene pairs, MSTRG.22608.1-PtoMYB73 and MSTRG.5634.1-PtoMYB27, in Cd tolerance of Populus, and detected insertions/deletions within lncRNAs as polymorphisms driving target gene expression. Genotype analysis of lncRNAs and heterologous overexpression of PtoMYB73 and PtoMYB27 in Arabidopsis indicated their effects on enhancing Cd tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and leaf growth, and the potential interaction mechanisms of PtoMYB73 with abiotic stresses. Our study identifies the genetic basis for the response of Populus to Cd treatment, facilitating genetic improvement of Cd tolerance in trees.
