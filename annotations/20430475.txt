Green algae of the genus Dunaliella can adapt to hypersaline environments and are considered model organisms for salinity tolerance. In an EST analysis in Dunaliella viridis under salt stress, we isolated a salt-inducible cDNA coding for the 26S proteasome subunit RPN10, designated DvRPN10. The DvRPN10 cDNA is 1472 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 377 amino acids. The DvRPN10 protein shares a high similarity to orthologs from other species. The function of DvRPN10 was confirmed by complementation of the yeast Deltarpn10 mutant. Q-PCR analysis of D. viridis cells grown in different salinities revealed that the transcript level of DvRPN10 increased in proportion to the external salinity within a range of 0.5-3 M NaCl, but decreased significantly at extremely high salinities (4-5 M NaCl). When a salinity shock of 1-3 M NaCl was applied to D. viridis cells, DvRPN10 mRNA levels remained steady during the first 36 h, and then gradually elevated to the level observed at 3 M NaCl. The gene structure of DvRPN10 was revealed by sequencing of a BAC clone containing this gene. Possible transcription factor binding sites related to stress tolerance were found in the promoter region of DvRPN10. The expression of DvRPN10 in response to the external salinity suggests that RPN10-mediated protein degradation plays a role in the salinity tolerance of D. viridis.
