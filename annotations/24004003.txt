Salicylic acid (SA) is a small phenolic molecule with hormonal properties, and is an essential component of the immune response. SA exerts its functions by interacting with protein targets; however, the specific cellular components modulated by SA and critical for immune signal transduction are largely unknown. To uncover cellular activities targeted by SA, we probed Arabidopsis protein microarrays with a functional analog of SA. We demonstrate that thimet oligopeptidases (TOPs) constitute a class of SA-binding enzymes. Biochemical evidence demonstrated that SA interacts with TOPs and inhibits their peptidase activities to various degrees both in vitro and in plant extracts. Functional characterization of mutants with altered TOP expression indicated that TOP1 and TOP2 mediate SA-dependent signaling and are necessary for the immune response to avirulent pathogens. Our results support a model whereby TOP1 and TOP2 act in separate pathways to modulate SA-mediated cellular processes.
