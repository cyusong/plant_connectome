Symbioses between legumes and rhizobia require establishment of the plant-derived symbiosome membrane, which surrounds the rhizobia and accommodates the symbionts by providing an interface for nutrient and signal exchange. The host cytoskeleton and endomembrane trafficking systems play central roles in the formation of a functional symbiotic interface for rhizobia endosymbiosis; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the nodulation-specific kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein (nKCBP), a plant-specific microtubule-based kinesin motor, controls central vacuole morphogenesis in symbiotic cells in Medicago truncatula. Phylogenetic analysis further indicated that nKCBP duplication occurs solely in legumes of the clade that form symbiosomes. Knockout of nKCBP results in central vacuole deficiency, defective symbiosomes and abolished nitrogen fixation. nKCBP decorates linear particles along microtubules, and crosslinks microtubules with the actin cytoskeleton, to control central vacuole formation by modulating vacuolar vesicle fusion in symbiotic cells. Together, our findings reveal that rhizobia co-opted nKCBP to achieve symbiotic interface formation by regulating cytoskeletal assembly and central vacuole morphogenesis during nodule development.

nKCBP: !crosslinks! Microtubules with actin cytoskeleton 
nKCBP: !modulates! Vacuolar vesicle fusion in symbiotic cells 
Rhizobia: !co-opted! nKCBP
