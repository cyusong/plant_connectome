<i>Colletotrichum</i> is a plant pathogenic fungus which is able to infect virtually every economically important plant species. Up to now no common infection mechanism has been identified comparing different plant and <i>Colletotrichum</i> species. Plant hormones play a crucial role in plant-pathogen interactions regardless whether they are symbiotic or pathogenic. In this review we analyze the role of ethylene, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, auxin and salicylic acid during <i>Colletotrichum</i> infections. Different <i>Colletotrichum</i> strains are capable of auxin production and this might contribute to virulence. In this review the role of different plant hormones in plant-<i>Colletotrichum</i> interactions will be discussed and thereby auxin biosynthetic pathways in <i>Colletotrichum</i> spp. will be proposed.
