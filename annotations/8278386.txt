['8278386', 'The plant growth hormone indoleacetic acid (IAA) transcriptionally activates gene  expression in plants. Some of the genes whose expression is induced by IAA encode  a family of proteins in pea (PS-IAA4 and PS-IAA6) and Arabidopsis (IAA1 and IAA2)  that contain putative nuclear localization signals that direct a  beta-glucuronidase reporter protein into the nucleus. Pulse-chase and  immunoprecipitation experiments have defined the t1/2 of the PS-IAA4 and PS-IAA6  proteins to be 8 and 6 min, respectively. Their most prominent feature is the  presence of a beta alpha alpha motif similar to the beta-sheet DNA-binding domain  found in prokaryotic repressors of the Arc family. Based on these data, we  suggest that plant tissues express short-lived nuclear proteins as a primary  response to IAA. We propose that these proteins act as activators or repressors  of genes responsible for mediating the various auxin responses.', '1994 Jan 4', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.91.1.326', 'Theologis']
