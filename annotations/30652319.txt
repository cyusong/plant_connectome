Barley is used for food and feed, and brewing. Nondormant seeds are required for malting, but the lack of dormancy can lead to preharvest sprouting (PHS), which is also undesired. Here, we report several new loci that modulate barley seed dormancy and PHS. Using genome-wide association mapping of 184 spring barley genotypes, we identified four new, highly significant associations on chromosomes 1H, 3H, and 5H previously not associated with barley seed dormancy or PHS. A total of 71 responsible genes were found mostly related to flowering time and hormone signalling. A homolog of the well-known Arabidopsis Delay of Germination 1 (DOG1) gene was annotated on the barley chromosome 3H. Unexpectedly, DOG1 appears to play only a minor role in barley seed dormancy. However, the gibberellin oxidase gene HvGA20ox1 contributed to dormancy alleviation, and another seven important loci changed significantly during after-ripening. Furthermore, nitric oxide release correlated negatively with dormancy and shared 27 associations. Origin and growth environment affected seed dormancy and PHS more than did agronomic traits. Days to anthesis and maturity were shorter when seeds were produced under drier conditions, seeds were less dormant, and PHS increased, with a heritability of 0.57-0.80. The results are expected to be useful for crop improvement.
