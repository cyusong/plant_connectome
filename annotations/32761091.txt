Multicarpellate fruits are larger and produce more seeds than mono- or bicarpellate fruits, enhancing the reproductive capacity of the plant. To identify the phenotypic and molecular differences among florets of different carpel types, we studied carpel formation and fusion in the grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cultivar 'Xiangfei', which produces a high proportion of multicarpellate fruit. We also determined the function of VvSUPERMAN-like (VvSUP-like) and explored its relationship with VvWUS (VvWUSCHEL) and VvAG1 (VvAGAMOUS), which is related to the formation of carpel primordia. We showed that carpel formation and fusion were largely consistent between bicarpellate and tricarpellate ovaries, which both involve congenital fusion; rather, the differences between these ovary types arose from variation in carpel primordia number and location. Transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants expressing VvSUP-like produced significantly fewer carpels and other floral organs than the wild type. Moreover, transcriptome sequencing results indicate that VvSUP-like was more highly expressed in bicarpellate than in tricarpellate 'Xiangfei' florets. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that VvSUP-like inhibits the expression of VvAG1 and VvWUS by directly binding to their promoters, and VvWUS promotes VvAG1 expression by directly binding to its promoter. VvSUP-like inhibits the feedback signaling between VvWUS and VvAG1. Together, these results suggest that VvSUP-like negatively regulates the number of carpels that develop by inhibiting VvAG1 and VvWUS expression.
