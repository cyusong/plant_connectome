As a histone variant, H2A.Z is highly conserved among species and plays a significant role in diverse cellular processes. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of H2A.Z in Oryza sativa (rice) callus and seedling by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation using H2A.Z antibody and high-throughput sequencing. We found a significantly high peak and a small peak of H2A.Z distributed at the 5' and 3' ends of highly expressed genes, respectively. H2A.Z was also associated with inactive genes in both tissues. H3 lysine 4 trimethylation was associated with H2A.Z deposition at the 5' end of expressed genes, and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation peaks were partially associated with H2A.Z. In summary, our study provides global analysis data for the distribution of H2A.Z in the rice genome. Our results demonstrate that the differential deposition of H2A.Z might play important roles in gene transcription during rice development.
