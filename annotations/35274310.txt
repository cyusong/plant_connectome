In the soil, plant roots associated with fungi often encounter uneven distribution of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> )/ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ) patches, but the mechanism underlying N form-influenced plant-fungal interactions remains limited. We inoculated Arabidopsis with a root endophyte Phomopsis liquidambaris, and evaluated the effects of P. liquidambaris on plant performance under NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> nutrition. Under NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> nutrition, P. liquidambaris inoculation promoted seedling growth, whereas under NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> nutrition, P. liquidambaris suppressed seedling growth. Under high NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> conditions, fungus-colonized roots displayed increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> efflux, similar to the effect of ammonium stress caused by elevated NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> levels. Notably, this fungus excluded NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> during interactions with host roots, thereby leading to increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> levels at the plant-fungal interface under high NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> conditions. A nitrite reductase-deficient strain that excludes NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> but absorbs NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> , decreased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> levels in Arabidopsis shoots and rescued plant growth and nitrogen metabolism under high NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> levels. Transcriptomic analysis highlighted that P. liquidambaris had altered transcriptional responses associated with plant response to inorganic N forms. Our results demonstrate that fungus-regulated NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> /NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> dynamics at the plant-fungal interface alters plant response to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> /NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> nutrition. This study highlights the essential functions of root endophytes in plant adaptation to soil nitrogen nutrients.
