In trees, dead and living cells of secondary xylem (wood) function collectively, rendering cell-to-cell communication challenging. Water and solutes are transported over long distances from the roots to the above-ground organs via vessels, the main component of wood, and then radially over short distances to the neighboring cells. This enables proper functioning of trees and integrates whole-plant activity. In this study, tracer loading, immunolocalization experiments and inhibitor assays were used to decipher the mechanisms enabling transport in wood of Acer pseudoplatanus (maple), Fraxinus excelsior (ash) and Populus tremula × tremuloides (poplar) trees. We show that tracer uptake from dead water-conducting vessels, elements of the apoplasm, to living vessel-associated cells (VACs) of the xylem parenchyma of the symplasm system proceeds via the endocytic pathway, including clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent processes. These findings enhance our understanding of the transport pathways in complex wood tissue, providing experimental evidence of the involvement of VACs and endocytosis in radial uptake from vessels.

Vessels: !transport! Water and solutes 
VACs: !uptake from! Dead water-conducting vessels 
Endocytosis: !mediates! Uptake from vessels to VACs 
Clathrin: !facilitates! Clathrin-mediated endocytosis 
Clathrin: !inhibits! Clathrin-independent endocytosis
