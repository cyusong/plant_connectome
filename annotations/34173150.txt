The ER or donut-like structures localized aquaporin NIP5;1, which interacts with PIPs and alters their localization from plasma membrane to donut-like structures, regulates water permeability. NOD26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) play important roles in nutrient uptake and response to various stresses. However, there have been few studies of their functions in water transportation in citrus. Here, we demonstrate the functions of a novel citrus NIP aquaporin (CsNIP5;1) via multiple physiological and biochemical experiments. CsNIP5;1 showed high water permeability when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and yeast. However, subcellular localization assays showed that this protein was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or donut-like structures in citrus callus and tobacco leaf. Meanwhile, overexpression of CsNIP5;1 led to a reduction in the water permeability of citrus callus. Protein-protein interaction experiments and subcellular localization assays further revealed that CsNIP5;1 physically interacted with PIPs (CsPIP1;1 and AtPIP2;1), which altered their subcellular localization from the plasma membrane to donut-like structures. Together, CsNIP5;1 was identified as a good water channel when expressed in oocytes and yeast. Meanwhile, CsNIP5;1 participated in the regulation of water permeability of citrus callus, which may be associated with CsNIP5;1-induced re-localization of water channels PIPs. In summary, these results provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of AQPs-mediated water diffusion.
