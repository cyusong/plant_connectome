Identified over twenty years ago and distantly related to animal caspases are a group of cysteine proteases known as metacaspases. Throughout the years, much like caspase roles in metazoans, metacaspases have been shown to be involved in regulating cellular death in non-metazoan organisms. Yet, continued research on metacaspases describes these proteins as intricate and multifunctional, displaying striking diversity on distinct biological functions. In this review, we intend to describe the recent advances in our understanding of the divergence of metacaspase functionality in plants and fungi. We will dissect the duality of metacaspase activity in the context of plant-pathogen interactions, providing a unique lens from which to characterize metacaspases in the development, immunity, and stress responses of plants, and the development and virulence of fungi. Furthermore, we explore the evolutionary trajectory of fungal metacaspases to delineate their structure and function. Bridging the gap between metacaspase roles in immunity and pathogenicity of plant-pathogen interactions can enable more effective and targeted phytopathogen control efforts to increase production of globally important food crops. Therefore, the exploitation and manipulation of metacaspases in plants or fungi represent new potential avenues for developing mitigation strategies against plant pathogens.
