['10359080', 'We have cloned a novel nuclear gene for a ribosomal protein of rice and  Arabidopsis that is like the bacterial ribosomal protein S9. To determine the  subcellular localization of the gene product, we fused the N-terminal region and  green fluorescent protein and expressed it transiently in rice seedlings.  Localized fluorescence was detectable only in chloroplasts, indicating that this  nuclear gene encodes chloroplast ribosomal protein S9. The N-terminal region of  rice ribosomal protein S9 was found to have a high sequence similarity to the  transit peptide region of the rice chloroplast ribosomal protein L12, suggesting  that these transit peptides have a common lineage.', '1999 May 7', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00491-3', 'Tsutsumi']
