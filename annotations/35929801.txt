TANDEM ZINC-FINGER/PLUS3 (TZP) is a transcriptional regulator that acts at the crossroads of light and photoperiodic signaling. Here, we unveil a role for TZP in fine-tuning hypocotyl elongation under red light and long-day conditions. We provide genetic evidence for a synergistic action between TZP and PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL 1 (PCH1) in regulating the protein abundance of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) and downstream gene expression in response to red light and long days (LDs). Furthermore, we show that TZP is a positive regulator of the red/far-red light receptor and thermosensor phytochrome B (phyB) by promoting phyB protein abundance, nuclear body formation, and signaling. Our data therefore assign a function to TZP in regulating two key red light signaling components, phyB and PIF4, but also uncover a new role for PCH1 in regulating hypocotyl elongation in LDs. Our findings provide a framework for the understanding of the mechanisms associated with the TZP signal integration network and their importance for optimizing plant growth and adaptation to a changing environment.
