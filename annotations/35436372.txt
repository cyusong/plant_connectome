High-affinity phosphate (Pi) transporters (PHTs) PHT1;1 and PHT1;4 are necessary for plant root Pi uptake especially under Pi-deficient conditions, but how their protein stability is modulated remains elusive. Here, we identified a Ttransfer DNA insertion mutant of Sorting Nexin1 (SNX1), which had more Pi content and less anthocyanin accumulation than the wild type under deficient Pi. By contrast, the snx1-2 mutant displayed higher sensitivity to exogenous arsenate in terms of seed germination and root elongation, revealing higher Pi uptake rates. Further study showed that SNX1 could co-localize and interact with PHT1;1 and PHT1;4 in vesicles and at the plasma membrane. Genetic analysis showed that increased Pi content in the snx1-2 mutant under low Pi conditions could be extensively compromised by mutating PHT1;1 in the double mutant snx1-2 pht1;1, revealing that SNX1 is epistatic to PHT1;1. In addition, SNX1 negatively controls PHT1;1 protein stability; therefore, PHT1;1 protein abundance in the plasma membrane was increased in the snx1-2 mutant compared with the wild type under either sufficient or deficient Pi. Together, our study (i) identifies SNX1 as a key modulator of the plant response to low Pi and (ii) unravels its role in the modulation of PHT1;1 protein stability, PHT1;1 accumulation at the plasma membrane, and root Pi uptake.
