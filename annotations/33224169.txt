Autophagy is a catabolic process that takes place under both normal and adverse conditions and is important for the degradation of various organelles and proteins that are no longer needed. Thus, it can be viewed as both a constitutive recycling machinery and an adaptation mechanism. Increase in the activity of autophagy can be caused by multiple biotic and abiotic stress factors. Though intensive research in the past decade has elucidated many molecular details of plant autophagy, the mechanisms of induction and regulation of the process remain understudied. Here, we discuss the role of ATG8 proteins in autophagic signaling and regulation with an emphasis on the significance of ATG8 diversification for adapting autophagy to the changing needs of plants.
