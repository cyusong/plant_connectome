The effects of the positive charges of amines such as spermine (SPM), putrescine (PUT) and methylamine (MET) on the protection of PSII against excessive illumination were investigated in isolated thylakoid membranes. Under photoinhibition conditions, water oxidation, the kinetics of the Chl fluorescence rise and charge recombination in PSII were affected. A low concentration of SPM (1 mM) added before photoinhibition produced a significant improvement of F(v)/F(0), the oxygen yield and the amplitude of the B-band of thermoluminescence compared with the other amines. Amongst the amines studied, only SPM could protect the photosynthetic apparatus under photoinhibition conditions. This protection was probably provided by the polycationic nature of SPM (four positive charges at physiological pH), which can stabilize surface-exposed proteins of PSII through electrostatic interaction.

spermine: !protects! PSII 
SPM: !stabilizes! proteins 
SPM: !interacts with! surface-exposed proteins 
SPM: !has! four positive charges
