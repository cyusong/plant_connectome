The plant hormone auxin is a major coordinator of plant growth and development in response to diverse environmental signals, including nutritional conditions. Sole ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) nutrition is one of the unique growth-suppressing conditions for plants. Therefore, the quest to understand NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-mediated developmental defects led us to analyze auxin metabolism. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the most predominant natural auxin, accumulates in the leaves and roots of mature Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown on NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, but not in the root tips. We found changes at the expressional level in reactions leading to IAA biosynthesis and deactivation in different tissues. Finally, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> nutrition would facilitate the formation of inactive oxidized IAA as the final product. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-mediated accelerated auxin turnover rates implicate transient and local IAA peaks. A noticeable auxin pattern in tissues correlates with the developmental adaptations of the short and highly branched root system of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-grown plants. Therefore, the spatiotemporal distribution of auxin might be a root-shaping signal specific to adjust to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-stress conditions.
