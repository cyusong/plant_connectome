['16489122', 'Rapid, auxin-responsive degradation of multiple auxin/indole-3-acetic acid  (Aux/IAA) proteins is essential for plant growth and development. Domain II  residues were previously shown to be required for the degradation of several  Arabidopsis thaliana Aux/IAA proteins. We examined the degradation of additional  full-length family members and the proteolytic importance of N-terminal residues  outside domain II using luciferase (LUC) fusions. Elimination of domain I did not  affect degradation. However, substituting an Arg for a conserved Lys between  domains I and II specifically impaired basal degradation without compromising the  auxin-mediated acceleration of degradation. IAA8, IAA9, and IAA28 contain domain  II and a conserved Lys, but they were degraded more slowly than previously  characterized family members when expressed as LUC fusions, suggesting that  sequences outside domain II influence proteolysis. We analyzed the degradation of  IAA31, with a region somewhat similar to domain II but without the conserved Lys,  and of IAA20, which lacks domain II and the conserved Lys. Both IAA20:LUC and  epitope-tagged IAA20 were long-lived, and their longevity was not influenced by  auxin. Epitope-tagged IAA31 was long-lived, like IAA20, but by contrast, it  showed accelerated degradation in response to auxin. The existence of long-lived  and auxin-insensitive Aux/IAA proteins suggeststhat they may play a novel role in  auxin signaling.', '2006 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.039172', 'Callis']
