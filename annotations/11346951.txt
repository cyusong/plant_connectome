['11346951', 'Calmodulin (CaM), a primary Ca2+ receptor in all eukaryotic cells, is a  multifunctional protein that functions by interacting with and modulating the  activities of a wide variety of target proteins. Identifying and characterizing  these CaM-binding target proteins is essential to define the pathways by which  Ca(2+)-regulated signals are transduced. An Arabidopsis thaliana L. flower cDNA  expression library constructed in lambda ZAPII was screened for CaM-binding  proteins with 35S-labeled CaM. A partial cDNA whose encoded protein shares a high  level of similarity with yeast CDC48p was isolated. A genomic clone was isolated  using the partial length cDNA clone as a probe, and its nucleotide sequence was  determined. The genomic DNA sequence was used to design oligonucleotide primers  for polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) experiments that facilitated cloning and  reconstructing a full-length, 3.4-kb cDNA clone. The cDNA encodes a 111-kDa  CaM-interacting protein (CIP111) containing motifs characteristic of a diverse  family of ATPases, including proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, protein  degradation, and vesicle-mediated protein transport. A truncated fusion protein  encoded by the carboxy-terminal region of CIP111 was produced in Escherichia coli  and shown to bind CaM in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner by protein gel blot and  affinity chromatography binding assays. Reverse-transcription PCR analyses  demonstrated that CIP111 mRNA is expressed in all organs examined including  flowers, siliques, floral stalks, leaves, and roots. DNA blot hybridization  analyses indicate that a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis is likely to encode  CIP111.', '2001 Apr', 'Planta', '10.1007/s004250000440', 'Zielinski']
