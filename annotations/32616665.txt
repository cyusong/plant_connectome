Cytidine-to-uridine RNA editing is a posttranscriptional process in plant organelles, mediated by specific pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. In angiosperms, hundreds of sites undergo RNA editing. By contrast, only 13 sites are edited in the moss <i>Physcomitrium</i> (<i>Physcomitrella</i>) <i>patens</i> Some are conserved between the two species, like the mitochondrial editing site nad5eU598RC. The PPR proteins assigned to this editing site are known in both species: the DYW-type PPR protein PPR79 in <i>P. patens</i> and the E+-type PPR protein CWM1 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). CWM1 also edits sites ccmCeU463RC, ccmBeU428SL, and nad5eU609VV. Here, we reciprocally expressed the <i>P. patens</i> and Arabidopsis editing factors in the respective other genetic environment. Surprisingly, the <i>P. patens</i> editing factor edited all target sites when expressed in the Arabidopsis <i>cwm1</i> mutant background, even when carboxy-terminally truncated. Conversely, neither Arabidopsis CWM1 nor CWM1-PPR79 chimeras restored editing in <i>P. patens ppr79 knockout</i> plants. A CWM1-like PPR protein from the early diverging angiosperm macadamia (<i>Macadamia integrifolia</i>) features a complete DYW domain and fully rescued editing of nad5eU598RC when expressed in <i>P. patens.</i> We conclude that (1) the independently evolved <i>P. patens</i> editing factor PPR79 faithfully operates in the more complex Arabidopsis editing system, (2) truncated PPR79 recruits catalytic DYW domains in trans when expressed in Arabidopsis, and (3) the macadamia CWM1-like protein retains the capacity to work in the less complex <i>P. patens</i> editing environment.
