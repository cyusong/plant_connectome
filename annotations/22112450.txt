In order to adapt to environmental changes of light species and intensity, higher plants furnish complicate signaling systems such as the UVR/COP/HY5 cascade which links several diverse classes of photoreceptors. In addition UV-B light provokes accelerated production of UV-B protectants such as flavonoids and vitamins. Following intensive research efforts, genes in the UV-B signaling cascade have been characterized via forward genetics approaches following mutant screens relying on sensitivity to UV-B irradiation. However detailed processes of the linkage between light signaling and the upregulation of metabolite accumulation remain unclear. Here we review both the light signal cascades and metabolite pathways responding to UV-B exposure. Finally we generate co-expression network analysis using published data in order to find novel candidate genes which link light signaling and transcriptional regulation to metabolic biosynthesis in attempt to describe how these processes are interlinked.
