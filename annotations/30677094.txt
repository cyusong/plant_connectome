['30677094', 'INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD)/ BIRD proteins are a highly conserved plant-specific  family of transcription factors which play multiple roles in plant development  and physiology. Here, we show that mutation in IDD4/IMPERIAL EAGLE increases  resistance to the hemi-biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, indicating that  IDD4 may act as a repressor of basal immune response and PAMP-triggered immunity.  Furthermore, the idd4 mutant exhibits enhanced plant-growth indicating IDD4 as  suppressor of growth and development. Transcriptome comparison of idd4 mutants  and IDD4ox lines aligned to genome-wide IDD4 DNA-binding studies revealed major  target genes related to defense and developmental-biological processes. IDD4 is a  phospho-protein that interacts and becomes phosphorylated on two conserved sites  by the MAP kinase MPK6. DNA-binding studies of IDD4 after flg22 treatment and  with IDD4 phosphosite mutants show enhanced binding affinity to ID1  motif-containing promoters and its function as a transcriptional regulator. In  contrast to the IDD4-phospho-dead mutant, the IDD4 phospho-mimicking mutant shows  altered susceptibility to PstDC3000, salicylic acid levels and transcriptome  reprogramming. In summary, we found that IDD4 regulates various hormonal pathways  thereby coordinating growth and development with basal immunity.', '2019 Jan', 'PLoS Pathog', '10.1371/journal.ppat.1007499', 'Hirt']
