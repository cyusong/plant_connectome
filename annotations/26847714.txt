ARGONAUTE7 (AGO7), a key regulator of the trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNA) pathway, plays a conserved role in controlling leaf pattern among species. However, little is known about the ta-siRNA pathway in regulating inflorescence architecture and fruit yield. In this study, we characterized the expression pattern, subcellular localization and developmental functions of SlAGO7 in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Overexpressing SlAGO7 in tomato exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes, including improved axillary bud formation, altered leaf morphology and inflorescence architecture, and increased fruit yield. Cross-sectioning of leaves showed that the number of vascular bundles was significantly increased in 35:SlAGO7 lines. Overexpression of SlAGO7 increased the production of ta-siRNA, and repressed the expression ta-siRNA-targeted genes (SlARF2a, SlARF2b, SlARF3 and SlARF4). Further analysis showed that overexpression of SlAGO7 alters the expression of key genes implicated in leaf morphology, inflorescence architecture, auxin transport and signaling. In addition, the altered auxin response of 35:SlAGO7 lines were also investigated. These results suggested that SlAGO7 plays a positive role in determining inflorescence architecture and fruit yield though the ta-siRNA pathway. Therefore, SlAGO7 represents a useful gene that can be incorporated in tomato breeding programs for developing cultivars with yield potential.
