['20969742', 'Reticulons are integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane proteins that have  the ability to shape the ER into tubules. It has been hypothesized that their  unusually long conserved hydrophobic regions cause reticulons to assume a  wedge-like topology that induces membrane curvature. Here we provide proof of  this hypothesis. When over-expressed, an Arabidopsis thaliana reticulon (RTNLB13)  localized to, and induced constrictions in, cortical ER tubules. Ectopic  expression of RTNLB13 was sufficient to induce ER tubulation in an Arabidopsis  mutant (pah1 pah2) whose ER membrane is mostly present in a sheet-like form. By  sequential shortening of the four transmembrane domains (TMDs) of RTNLB13, we  show that the length of the transmembrane regions is directly correlated with the  ability of RTNLB13 to induce membrane tubulation and to form low-mobility  complexes within the ER membrane. We also show that full-length TMDs are  necessary for the ability of RTNLB13 to reside in the ER membrane.', '2010 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04337.x', 'Frigerio']
