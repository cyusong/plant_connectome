The hypersensitive-induced reaction (HIR) gene family is associated with the hypersensitive response (HR) that is a part of the plant defense system against bacterial and fungal pathogens. The involvement of HIR genes in response to viral pathogens has not yet been studied. We now report that the HIR3 genes of Nicotiana benthamiana and Oryza sativa (rice) were upregulated following rice stripe virus (RSV) infection. Silencing of HIR3s in N.막enthamiana resulted in an increased accumulation of RSV RNAs, whereas overexpression of HIR3s in N.막enthamiana or rice reduced the expression of RSV RNAs and decreased symptom severity, while also conferring resistance to Turnip mosaic virus, Potato virus X, and the bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas oryzae. Silencing of HIR3 genes in N.막enthamiana reduced the content of salicylic acid (SA) and was accompanied by the downregulated expression of genes in the SA pathway. Transient expression of the two HIR3 gene homologs from N.막enthamiana or the rice HIR3 gene in N.막enthamiana leaves caused cell death and an accumulation of SA, but did not do so in EDS1-silenced plants or in plants expressing NahG. The results indicate that HIR3 contributes to plant basal resistance via an EDS1- and SA-dependent pathway.
