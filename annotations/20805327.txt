['20805327', 'ROXY1 and ROXY2 are CC-type floral glutaredoxins with redundant functions in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) anther development. We show here that plants  lacking the basic leucine-zipper transcription factors TGA9 and TGA10 have  defects in male gametogenesis that are strikingly similar to those in roxy1 roxy2  mutants. In tga9 tga10 mutants, adaxial and abaxial anther lobe development is  differentially affected, with early steps in anther development blocked in  adaxial lobes and later steps affected in abaxial lobes. Distinct from roxy1  roxy2, microspore development in abaxial anther lobes proceeds to a later stage  with the production of inviable pollen grains contained within nondehiscent  anthers. Histological analysis shows multiple defects in the anther dehiscence  program, including abnormal stability and lignification of the middle layer and  defects in septum and stomium function. Compatible with these defects, TGA9 and  TGA10 are expressed throughout early anther primordia but resolve to the middle  and tapetum layers during meiosis of pollen mother cells. Several lines of  evidence suggest that ROXY promotion of anther development is mediated in part by  TGA9 and TGA10. First, TGA9 and TGA10 expression overlaps with ROXY1/2 during  anther development. Second, TGA9/10 and ROXY1/2 operate downstream of  SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE, where they positively regulate a common set of genes that  contribute to tapetal development. Third, TGA9 and TGA10 directly interact with  ROXY proteins in yeast and in plant cell nuclei. These findings suggest that  activation of TGA9/10 transcription factors by ROXY-mediated modification of  cysteine residues promotes anther development, thus broadening our understanding  of how redox-regulated TGA factors function in plants.', '2010 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.159111', 'Hepworth']
