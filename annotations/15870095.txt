Treatment of tobacco BY-2 cells with 10 mM caffeine that was started after the cells had entered the mitotic phase did not completely inhibit the deposition of callose in the cell plate and allowed the centrifugal redistribution of phragmoplast microtubules. On the other hand, when treatment with caffeine was started before the cells entered the mitotic phase, the deposition of callose was completely inhibited and the redistribution of phragmoplast microtubules was also inhibited. As the inhibition of redistribution of phragmoplast microtubules seems to be caused by the inhibition of depolymerization of microtubules at the central region of the phragmoplast, these results strongly suggest that the deposition of callose in the cell plate is tightly linked with the depolymerization of phragmoplast microtubules. Callose deposition was observed in phragmoplasts isolated from caffeine-treated cells as well as in those isolated from non-caffeine-treated cells, and caffeine did not inhibit callose synthesis in isolated phragmoplast, indicating that caffeine neither inhibits the accumulation of callose synthase at the equatorial regions of the phragmoplast nor arrests callose synthase itself.

Treatment of tobacco BY-2 cells: !inhibits! Depolymerization of microtubules 
Depolymerization of microtubules: !linked with! Callose deposition 
Callose deposition: !observed in! Isolated phragmoplasts 
Caffeine: !does not inhibit! Accumulation of callose synthase 
Accumulation of callose synthase: !arrests! Callose synthase
