Stomatal responses to environmental signals differ substantially between ferns and angiosperms. However, the mechanisms that lead to such different responses remain unclear. Here we investigated the extent to which leaf metabolism contributes to coordinate the differential stomatal behaviour among ferns and angiosperms. Stomata from all species were responsive to light and CO<sub>2</sub> transitions. However, fern stomatal responses were slower and minor in both absolute and relative terms. Angiosperms have higher stomatal density, but this is not correlated with speed of stomatal closure. The metabolic responses throughout the diel course and under different CO<sub>2</sub> conditions differ substantially among ferns and angiosperms. Higher sucrose content and an increased sucrose-to-malate ratio during high CO<sub>2</sub> -induced stomatal closure was observed in angiosperms compared to ferns. Furthermore, the speed of stomatal closure was positively and negatively correlated with sugars and organic acids, respectively, suggesting that the balance between sugars and organic acids aids in explaining the faster stomatal responses of angiosperms. Our results suggest that mesophyll-derived metabolic signals, especially those associated with sucrose and malate, may also be important to modulate the differential stomatal behaviour between ferns and angiosperms, providing important new information that helps in understanding the metabolism-mediated mechanisms regulating stomatal movements across land plant evolution.
