Ascorbic acid (AsA) has high antioxidant activities, and its biosynthesis has been well studied by engineering of a single structural gene (SG) in staple crops, such as tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). However, engineering the AsA metabolic pathway by multi-SG for biofortification remains unclear. In this study, pyramiding transgenic lines including GDP-Mannose 3',5'-epimerase (<i>GME</i>) × GDP-d-mannose pyrophosphorylase (<i>GMP</i>), GDP-l-Gal phosphorylase (<i>GGP</i>) × l-Gal-1-P phosphatase (<i>GPP</i>) and <i>GME</i> × <i>GMP</i> × <i>GGP</i> × <i>GPP</i>, were obtained by hybridization of four key genes to get over-expression transgenic plants (<i>GME</i>, <i>GMP</i>, <i>GGP</i>, and <i>GPP</i>) in tomato. Pyramiding lines exhibited a significant increase in total ascorbate in leaves and red fruits except for <i>GGP</i> × <i>GPP</i>. Expression analysis indicated that increased accumulation of AsA in pyramiding transgenic lines is due to multigene regulation in AsA biosynthesis. Substrate feeding in leaf and fruit suggested that AsA biosynthesis was mainly contributed by the d-Man/l-Gal pathway in leaves, while alternative pathways may contribute to AsA accumulation in tomato fruit. Pyramiding lines showed an enhanced light response, stress tolerance, and AsA transport capacity. Also, fruit shape, fruit size, and soluble solids were slightly affected by pyramiding. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of gene pyramiding for ascorbate biosynthesis in tomato. SGs pyramiding promotes AsA biosynthesis, which in turn enhances light response and oxidative stress tolerance. Also, the data revealed an alternative ascorbate biosynthesis pathway between leaves and fruit of tomato.
