['16461275', 'BACKGROUND: Mitochondria evolved from intracellular bacterial symbionts.  Establishing mitochondria as organelles required a molecular machine to import  proteins across the mitochondrial outer membrane. This machinery, the TOM  complex, is composed of at least seven component parts, and its creation and  evolution represented a sizeable challenge. Although there is good evidence that  a core TOM complex, composed of three subunits, was established in the  protomitochondria, we suggest that the receptor component of the TOM complex  arose later in the evolution of this machine. RESULTS: We have solved by nuclear  magnetic resonance the structure of the presequence binding receptor from the TOM  complex of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The protein fold suggests that this  protein, AtTom20, belongs to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) superfamily, but  it is unusual in that it contains insertions lengthening the helices of each TPR  motif. Peptide titrations map the presequence binding site to a groove of the  concave surface of the receptor. In vitro functional assays and peptide  titrations suggest that the plant Tom20 is functionally equivalent to fungal and  animal Tom20s. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of the sequence and structure of Tom20  from plants and animals suggests that these two presequence binding receptors  evolved from two distinct ancestral genes following the split of the animal and  plant lineages. The need to bind equivalent mitochondrial targeting sequences and  to make similar interactions within an equivalent protein translocation machine  has driven the convergent evolution of two distinct proteins to a common  structure and function.', '2006 Feb 7', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2005.12.034', 'Gooley']
