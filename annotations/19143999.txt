['19143999', 'Activation of phospholipase D (PLD) produces phosphatidic acid (PA), a lipid  messenger implicated in cell growth and proliferation, but direct evidence for  PLD and PA promotion of growth at the organism level is lacking. Here we  characterize a new PLD gene, PLD epsilon, and show that it plays a role in  promoting Arabidopsis growth. PLD epsilon is mainly associated with the plasma  membrane, and is the most permissive of all PLDs tested with respect to its  activity requirements. Knockout (KO) of PLD epsilon decreases root growth and  biomass accumulation, whereas over-expression (OE) of PLD epsilon enhances root  growth and biomass accumulation. The level of PA was higher in OE plants, but  lower in KO plants than in wild-type plants, and suppression of PLD-mediated PA  formation by alcohol alleviated the growth-promoting effect of PLD epsilon. OE  and KO of PLD epsilon had opposite effects on lateral root elongation in response  to nitrogen. Increased expression of PLD epsilon also promoted root hair  elongation and primary root growth under severe nitrogen deprivation. The results  suggest that PLD epsilon and PA promote organism growth and play a role in  nitrogen signaling. The lipid-signaling process may play a role in connecting  membrane sensing of nutrient status to increased plant growth and biomass  production.', '2009 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03788.x', 'Wang']
