The highly variable cytoplasmic N-terminus of the plant diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) has been shown to have roles in oligomerization as well as allostery; however, the biological significance of the variation within this region is not understood. Comparing the coding sequences over the variable N-termini revealed the Poaceae DGAT1s contain relatively high GC compositional gradients as well as numerous direct and inverted repeats in this region. Using a variety of reciprocal chimeric DGAT1s from angiosperms we show that related N-termini had similar effects (positive or negative) on the accumulation of the recombinant protein in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. When expressed in <i>Camelina sativa</i> seeds the recombinant proteins of specific chimeras elevated total lipid content of the seeds as well as increased seed size. In addition, we combine N- and C-terminal as well as internal tags with high pH membrane reformation, protease protection and differential permeabilization. This led us to conclude the C-terminus is in the ER lumen; this contradicts earlier reports of the cytoplasmic location of plant DGAT1 C-termini.
