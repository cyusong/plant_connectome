The present study shows the importance of alternative oxidase (AOX) pathway in optimizing photosynthesis under high light (HL). The responses of photosynthesis and respiration were monitored as O(2) evolution and O(2) uptake in mesophyll protoplasts of pea pre-incubated under different light intensities. Under HL (3000 micromol m(-2) s(-1)), mesophyll protoplasts showed remarkable decrease in the rates of NaHCO(3)-dependent O(2) evolution (indicator of photosynthetic carbon assimilation), while decrease in the rates of respiratory O(2) uptake were marginal. While the capacity of AOX pathway increased significantly by two fold under HL, the capacity of cytochrome oxidase (COX) pathway decreased by >50% compared with capacities under darkness and normal light (NL). Further, the total cellular levels of pyruvate and malate, which are assimilatory products of active photosynthesis and stimulators of AOX activity, were increased remarkably parallel to the increase in AOX protein under HL. Upon restriction of AOX pathway using salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM), the observed decrease in NaHCO(3)-dependent O(2) evolution or p-benzoquinone (BQ)-dependent O(2) evolution [indicator of photosystem II (PSII) activity] and the increase in total cellular levels of pyruvate and malate were further aggravated/promoted under HL. The significance of raised malate and pyruvate levels in activation of AOX protein/AOX pathway, which in turn play an important role in dissipating excess chloroplastic reducing equivalents and sustenance of photosynthetic carbon assimilation to balance the effects of HL stress on photosynthesis, was depicted as a model.
