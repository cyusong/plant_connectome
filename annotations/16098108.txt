Expression of the pea plastocyanin gene (PetE) is regulated by light and plastid signals. Previous work indicated that light and plastid regulation of pea PetE operates post-transcriptionally in transgenic tobacco, and requires the correct 5' terminus of the PetE transcript and the PetE-coding region. The post-transcriptional light and plastid regulation of pea PetE has now been demonstrated to operate in transgenic Arabidopsis, where in contrast the endogenous PETE gene is regulated transcriptionally. Transgenic tobacco seedlings containing constructs with progressive 3' deletions of the PetE-coding region fused to the luciferase (Luc) reporter gene demonstrate that the first 60 nucleotides of the coding region are sufficient for regulated accumulation of Luc transcripts by light and plastid signalling pathways affected by treatment with norflurazon and lincomycin. PetE constructs containing premature stop codons were generated to investigate whether translation has a role in light or plastid regulation. Insertion of a stop codon in place of the second codon of the PetE-coding region diminished both light and plastid regulation of PetE transcripts, whereas stop codons inserted later in the transcript had no effect on light or plastid regulation. These experiments indicate that the 5' end of the plastocyanin-coding region contains sequences important for regulation by light and plastid signals.
