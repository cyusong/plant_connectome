The growth characteristics of some plums and their component parts have been previously studied, as have some aspects of their developmental anatomy and composition. However, little is known about either their metabolism or about the interactions between the metabolism of their component parts. In this study we investigated these aspects in the Japanese plum Ozark Premier. Throughout fruit and seed development, changes in sugar and organic acid contents, protein composition and abundance of selected enzymes were determined. In the stone, there was a transient accumulation of vegetative storage proteins. These were subsequently mobilized and this coincided with the onset of the lignification of the stone and the start of storage protein accumulation in the seed. Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) was present in the seeds, even though they lacked chlorophyll, and its presence may be related to limited gas exchange. In the flesh of some fruits, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and NADP malic enzyme (NADP-ME) are thought to function in the dissimilation of malate and/or citrate during ripening. However, PEPCK and NADP-ME were present in plum flesh for most of its development, although there was no net dissimilation of malate until the latter stages of ripening. There is an interaction between the developing seed and endocarp with respect to the utilization of imported sugars and amino acids. An hypothesis is presented to account for the presence of PEPCK and NADP-ME enzyme in plum flesh when there was no net dissimilation of organic acids.
