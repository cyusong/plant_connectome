['15741320', 'Upon activation by far-red light, phytochrome A signals are transduced through  several pathways to promote photomorphogenesis. The COP1 E3 ligase represses  photomorphogenesis in part by targeting transcription activators such as LAF1 and  HY5 for destruction. Another positive regulator of photomorphogenesis is HFR1, a  basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor. Here, we show that HFR1  colocalizes with COP1 in nuclear bodies, and that the HFR1 N-terminal region  (amino acids 1-131) interacts with the COP1 WD40 domain. HFR1(DeltaN), an HFR1  mutant lacking the two N-terminal, COP1-interacting motifs, still localizes in  nuclear bodies and retains weak affinity for COP1. Both HFR1 and HFR1(DeltaN) can  be ubiquitinated by COP1, although with different efficiencies. Expression of  35S-HFR1(DeltaN) in wild-type plants confers greater hypersensitivity to FR than  35S-HFR1 expression, and only seedlings expressing 35S-HFR1(DeltaN) display  constitutive photomorphogenesis. These phenotypic differences can be attributed  to the instability of HFR1 compared with HFR1(DeltaN). In transgenic plants, HFR1  levels are significantly elevated upon induced expression of a dominant-negative  COP1 mutant that interferes with endogenous COP1 E3 activity. Moreover, induced  expression of wild-type COP1 in transgenic plants accelerates post-translational  degradation of HFR1 under FR light. Taken together, our results show that HFR1 is  ubiquitinated by COP1 E3 ligase and marked for post-translational degradation  during photomorphogenesis.', '2005 Mar 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1247205', 'Chua']
