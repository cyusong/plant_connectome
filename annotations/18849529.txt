['18849529', 'During Arabidopsis seed development, the growing embryo invades and consumes the  surrounding endosperm tissue. The signalling pathways that coordinate the  separation of the embryo from the endosperm and the concomitant breakdown of the  endosperm are poorly understood. We have identified a novel bHLH transcription  factor, ZHOUPI (ZOU), which mediates these processes. ZOU is expressed  exclusively in the endosperm of developing seeds. It is activated in the central  cell immediately after fertilization and is initially expressed uniformly in  endosperm, subsequently resolving to the embryo surrounding region (ESR).  However, zou mutant embryos have defects in cuticle formation and in epidermal  cell adhesion, suggesting that ZOU functions non-autonomously to regulate  embryonic development. In addition, the endosperm of zou mutant seeds fails to  separate from the embryo, restricting embryo expansion and resulting in the  production of shrivelled collapsed seeds. zou seeds retain more endosperm than do  wild-type seeds at maturity, suggesting that ZOU also controls endosperm  breakdown. We identify several target genes whose expression in the ESR is  regulated by ZOU. These include ABNORMAL LEAF SHAPE1, which encodes a  subtilisin-like protease previously shown to have a similar role to ZOU in  regulating endosperm adhesion and embryonic epidermal development. However,  expression of several other ESR-specific genes is independent of ZOU. Therefore,  ZOU is not a general regulator of endosperm patterning, but rather controls  specific signalling pathways that coordinate embryo invasion and breakdown of  surrounding endosperm tissues.', '2008 Nov', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.026708', 'Ingram']
