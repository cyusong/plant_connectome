Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) is well known for its high unsaturated fatty acid content and great resistance to environmental stress. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in this annual oilseed crop. To gain greater insight into this mechanism, the transcriptome profiles of seeds at different developmental stages were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing. Sequencing of two normalized 454 libraries produced 831,632 clean reads. A total of 32,759 unigenes with an average length of 642 bp were obtained by de novo assembly, and 12,476 up-regulated and 12,390 down-regulated unigenes were identified in the 20 DAF (days after flowering) library compared with the 10 DAF library. Functional annotations showed that 220 genes annotated as fatty acid biosynthesis genes were up-regulated in 20 DAF sample. Among them, 47 candidate unigenes were characterized as responsible for polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis. To verify unigene expression levels calculated from the transcriptome analysis results, quantitative real-time PCR was performed on 11 randomly selected genes from the 220 up-regulated genes; 10 showed consistency between qRT-PCR and 454 pyrosequencing results. Investigation of gene expression levels revealed 32,759 genes involved in seed development, many of which showed significant changes in the 20 DAF sample compared with the 10 DAF sample. Our 454 pyrosequencing data for the camelina transcriptome provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways of polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in camelina. The genes characterized in our research will provide candidate genes for the genetic modification of crops.
