Sedentary plant parasitic nematodes have developed competences to reprogram host plant cell metabolism via sophisticated manipulation of gene expression, leading to the formation of permanent feeding sites for an unlimited source of food. Arabidopsis thaliana and the beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii is a good model for studying the mechanisms of compatible plant-nematode interactions and basic plant responses to nematode infection. Transcription factors are proteins that modulate plant reactions during regular development and under different biotic and abiotic stresses via direct binding to promoter regions of genes. Here, we report on the AtHRS1 gene encoding a MYB-related transcription factor belonging to the GARP family, whose expression is downregulated in syncytia, as confirmed by gene expression analysis. Constitutive overexpression of AtHRS1 disturbed the development of nematode-induced syncytia and led to a reduction in the number of developed females in transgenic A. thaliana roots. In contrast, the hrs1 mutant with decreased expression of AtHRS1 was more susceptible to cyst nematode infection. The influence of AtHRS1 on selected elements of the JA-dependent defence pathway suggests its mode of action in plant response to nematode attack. Based on these results, we suggest that the downregulation of AtHRS1 expression by nematode is important for its successful development.
