Pochonia chlamydosporia has been intensively studied in nematode control of different crops. We have investigated the interaction between P. chlamydosporia and the model system Arabidopsis thaliana under laboratory conditions in the absence of nematodes. This study demonstrates that P. chlamydosporia colonizes A. thaliana. Root colonization monitored with green fluorescent protein-tagged P. chlamydosporia and quantitative PCR (qPCR) quantitation methods revealed root cell invasion. Fungal inoculation reduced flowering time and stimulated plant growth, as determined by total FW increase, faster development of inflorescences and siliques, and a higher yield in terms of seed production per plant. Precocious flowering was associated with significant expression changes in key flowering-time genes. In addition, we also provided molecular and genetic evidence that point towards jasmonate signaling as an important factor to modulate progression of plant colonization by the fungus. Our results indicate that P. chlamydosporia provides benefits to the plant in addition to its nematophagous activity. This report highlights the potential of P. chlamydosporia to improve yield in economically important crops.
