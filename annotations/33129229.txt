Improving yield is a primary mission for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) breeders; development of cultivars with suitable architecture for high planting density (HPDA) can increase yield per unit area. We characterized a natural cotton mutant, AiSheng98 (AS98), which exhibits shorter height, shorter branch length, and more acute branch angle than wild-type. A copy number variant at the HPDA locus on Chromosome D12 (HPDA-D12), encoding a dehydration-responsive element-binding (DREB) transcription factor, GhDREB1B, strongly affects plant architecture in the AS98 mutant. We found an association between a tandem duplication of a c. 13.5 kb segment in HPDA-D12 and elevated GhDREB1B expression resulting in the AS98 mutant phenotype. GhDREB1B overexpression confers a significant decrease in plant height and branch length, and reduced branch angle. Our results suggest that fine-tuning GhDREB1B expression may be a viable engineering strategy for modification of plant architecture favorable to high planting density in cotton.
