We used a cDNA microarray approach to monitor the expression profile of rice (Oryza sativa) under cold stress and identified 328 cold-regulated genes. Thirteen such genes encoding MYB, homeodomain, and zinc finger proteins with unknown functions showed a significant change in expression under 72-h cold stress. Among them, OsMYB3R-2 was selected for further study. Unlike most plant R2R3 MYB transcription factors, OsMYB3R-2 has three imperfect repeats in the DNA-binding domain, the same as in animal c-MYB proteins. Expression of OsMYB3R-2 was induced by cold, drought, and salt stress. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transgenic plants overexpressing OsMYB3R-2 showed increased tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, and the seed germination of transgenic plants was more tolerant to abscisic acid or NaCl than that of wild type. The expression of some clod-related genes, such as dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2A, COR15a, and RCI2A, was increased to a higher level in OsMYB3R-2-overexpressing plants than in wild type. These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 acts as a master switch in stress tolerance.
