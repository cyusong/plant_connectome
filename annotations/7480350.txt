['7480350', "We report the molecular cloning and sequence of the cDNA coding for the  biotin-containing subunit of the chloroplastic acetylcoenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase  (ACCase) of Arabidopsis thaliana (CAC1). The 3' end of the CAC1 sequence, coding  for a peptide of 94 amino acids, which includes a putative biotinylation motif,  was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion  protein. The resulting GST-CAC1 fusion protein was biotinylated in vivo,  indicating that CAC1 codes for a biotin-containing protein. Antibodies generated  to the GST-CAC1 protein reacted solely with the 38-kD biotin-containing  polypeptide of Arabidopsis. Furthermore, these antibodies inhibited ACCase  activity in extracts from Arabidopsis leaves. The deduced amino acid sequence of  CAC1 has an apparent N-terminal chloroplast-targeting transit peptide. The CAC1  protein is coded by a single Arabidopsis gene, and its mRNA accumulates to the  highest levels in organs that are undergoing rapid growth. The amino acid  sequence of the CAC1 protein is most similar to the biotin carboxyl-carrier  protein component of eubacterial ACCases. These characterizations identify CAC1  as the biotin-containing subunit of the plastidic, heteromeric ACCase of  Arabidopsis. The results support the ancient origin of the two structurally  distinct ACCases of plants.", '1995 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.2.619', 'Nikolau']
