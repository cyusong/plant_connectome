Here we describe protein-protein interactions between signaling components in the conserved self-incompatibility pathway from Brassica spp. and Arabidopsis lyrata. Previously, we had demonstrated that ARC1 is necessary in A. lyrata for the rejection of self-pollen by the self-incompatibility pathway. The results described here demonstrate that A. lyrata ARC1 interacts with A. lyrata S Receptor Kinase (SRK1) in the yeast 2-hybrid system. A. lyrata ARC1 also interacted with B. napus SRK910 illustrating that interactions in this pathway are conserved across species. Finally, we discuss how the more widely occurring interactions between SRK and ARC1-related family members may be modulated in vivo by expression and subcellular localization patterns resulting in a particular response.
