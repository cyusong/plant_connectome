Globally, trees originating from high-rainfall tropical regions typically exhibit lower rates of light-saturated net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation (A) compared with those from high-rainfall temperate environments, when measured at a common temperature. One factor that has been suggested to contribute towards lower rates of A is lower mesophyll conductance. Using a combination of leaf gas exchange and carbon isotope discrimination measurements, we estimated mesophyll conductance (g<sub>m</sub> ) of several Australian tropical and temperate wet-forest trees, grown in a common environment. Maximum Rubisco carboxylation capacity, V<sub>cmax</sub> , was obtained from CO<sub>2</sub> response curves. g<sub>m</sub> and the drawdown of CO<sub>2</sub> across the mesophyll were both relatively constant. V<sub>cmax</sub> estimated on the basis of intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure, C<sub>i</sub> , was equivalent to that estimated using chloroplastic CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure, C<sub>c</sub> , using 'apparent' and 'true' Rubisco Michaelis-Menten constants, respectively Having ruled out g<sub>m</sub> as a possible factor in distorting variations in A between these tropical and temperate trees, attention now needs to be focused on obtaining more detailed information about Rubisco in these species.
