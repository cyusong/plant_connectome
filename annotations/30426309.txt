Molecular and functional characterization of four gene families of the Physalis exon junction complex (EJC) core improved our understanding of the evolution and function of EJC core genes in plants. The exon junction complex (EJC) plays significant roles in posttranscriptional regulation of genes in eukaryotes. However, its developmental roles in plants are poorly known. We characterized four EJC core genes from Physalis floridana that were named PFMAGO, PFY14, PFeIF4AIII and PFBTZ. They shared a similar phylogenetic topology and were expressed in all examined organs. PFMAGO, PFY14 and PFeIF4AIII were localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm while PFBTZ was mainly localized in the cytoplasm. No protein homodimerization was observed, but they could form heterodimers excluding the PFY14-PFBTZ heterodimerization. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of PFMAGO or PFY14 aborted pollen development and resulted in low plant survival due to a leaf-blight-like phenotype in the shoot apex. Carpel functionality was also impaired in the PFY14 knockdowns, whereas pollen maturation was uniquely affected in PFBTZ-VIGS plants. Once PFeIF4AIII was strongly downregulated, plant survival was reduced via a decomposing root collar after flowering and Chinese lantern morphology was distorted. The expression of Physalis orthologous genes in the DYT1-TDF1-AMS-bHLH91 regulatory cascade that is associated with pollen maturation was significantly downregulated in PFMAGO-, PFY14- and PFBTZ-VIGS flowers. Intron-retention in the transcripts of P. floridana dysfunctional tapetum1 (PFDYT1) occurred in these mutated flowers. Additionally, the expression level of WRKY genes in defense-related pathways in the shoot apex of PFMAGO- or PFY14-VIGS plants and in the root collar of PFeIF4AIII-VIGS plants was significantly downregulated. Taken together, the Physalis EJC core genes play multiple roles including a conserved role in male fertility and newly discovered roles in Chinese lantern development, carpel functionality and defense-related processes. These data increase our understanding of the evolution and functions of EJC core genes in plants.
