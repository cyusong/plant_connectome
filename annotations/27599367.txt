['27599367', 'The plant family 1 UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) are the biggest GT family in  plants, which are responsible for transferring sugar moieties onto a variety of  small molecules, and control many metabolic processes; however, their  physiological significance in planta is largely unknown. Here, we revealed that  two Arabidopsis glycosyltransferase genes, UGT79B2 and UGT79B3, could be strongly  induced by various abiotic stresses, including cold, salt and drought stresses.  Overexpression of UGT79B2/B3 significantly enhanced plant tolerance to low  temperatures as well as drought and salt stresses, whereas the ugt79b2/b3 double  mutants generated by RNAi (RNA interference) and CRISPR-Cas9 strategies were more  susceptible to adverse conditions. Interestingly, the expression of UGT79B2 and  UGT79B3 is directly controlled by CBF1 (CRT/DRE-binding factor 1, also named  DREB1B) in response to low temperatures. Furthermore, we identified the enzyme  activities of UGT79B2/B3 in adding UDP-rhamnose to cyanidin and cyanidin  3-O-glucoside. Ectopic expression of UGT79B2/B3 significantly increased the  anthocyanin accumulation, and enhanced the antioxidant activity in coping with  abiotic stresses, whereas the ugt79b2/b3 double mutants showed reduced  anthocyanin levels. When overexpressing UGT79B2/B3 in tt18 (transparent testa  18), a mutant that cannot synthesize anthocyanins, both genes fail to improve  plant adaptation to stress. Taken together, we demonstrate that UGT79B2 and  UGT79B3, identified as anthocyanin rhamnosyltransferases, are regulated by CBF1  and confer abiotic stress tolerance via modulating anthocyanin accumulation.', '2017 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13324', 'Hou']
