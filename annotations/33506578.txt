Non-specific phospholipase Cs (NPCs) are responsible for membrane lipid remodeling that involves hydrolysis of the polar head group of membrane phospholipids. Arabidopsis NPC2 and NPC6 are essential in gametogenesis, but their underlying role in the lipid remodeling remains elusive. Here, we show that these NPCs are required for triacylglycerol (TAG) production in pollen tube growth. NPC2 and NPC6 are highly expressed in developing pollen tubes and are localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutants of NPC2 and NPC6 showed reduced rate of pollen germination, length of pollen tube and amount of lipid droplets (LDs). Overexpression of NPC2 or NPC6 induced LD accumulation, which suggests that these NPCs are involved in LD production. Furthermore, mutants defective in the biosynthesis of TAG, a major component of LDs, showed defective pollen tube growth. These results suggest that NPC2 and NPC6 are essential in gametogenesis for a role in hydrolyzing phospholipids and producing TAG required for pollen tube growth. Thus, lipid remodeling from phospholipids to TAG during pollen tube growth represents an emerging role for the NPC family in plant developmental control.
