['21889052', 'The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) family of eukaryotic proteins has numerous  members in plants and is important for plant development. In the present study,  we cloned a novel PPR gene, designated AtNG1, and characterized the ng1  Arabidopsis mutant. Morphological and structural observation of an ng1 mutant  revealed that its sexual reproduction and seed formation processes are  essentially normal. The mature embryonic root of ng1 is fully developed and has a  well-differentiated structure; however, ng1 seeds cannot germinate, even when  supplied with supplemental hormones and nutrition. Further investigation showed  that embryo expansion and root cell elongation fails to occur after water  imbibitions. Transient gene expression analysis indicated that AtNG1 localizes in  mitochondrion. This implies that the deficiency of mitochondrion function might  be the reason for the failed seed germination. Thus, our finding confirmed that  AtNG1 plays a critical role in the early process of seed germination.', '2011 Oct', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.07.011', 'Sun']
