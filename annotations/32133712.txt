Intron-containing genes have the ability to generate multiple transcript isoforms by splicing, thereby greatly expanding the eukaryotic transcriptome and proteome. In eukaryotic cells, precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is performed by a mega-macromolecular complex defined as a spliceosome. Among its splicing components, U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) is the smallest subcomplex involved in early spliceosome assembly and 5'-splice site recognition. Its central component, named U1-70K, has been extensively characterized in animals and yeast. Very few investigations on U1-70K genes have been conducted in plants, however. To this end, we performed a comprehensive study to systematically identify 115 U1-70K genes from 67 plant species, ranging from algae to angiosperms. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the expansion of the plant U1-70K gene family was likely to have been driven by whole-genome duplications. Subsequent comparisons of gene structures, protein domains, promoter regions and conserved splicing patterns indicated that plant U1-70Ks are likely to preserve their conserved molecular function across plant lineages and play an important functional role in response to environmental stresses. Furthermore, genetic analysis using T-DNA insertion mutants suggested that Arabidopsis U1-70K may be involved in response to osmotic stress. Our results provide a general overview of this gene family in Viridiplantae and will act as a reference source for future mechanistic studies on this U1 snRNP-specific splicing factor.
