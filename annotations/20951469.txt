Nitric oxide (NO) and the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) are involved in plant defense responses during plant-pathogen interactions. NO has been shown to be involved in the induction of PA production in response to the pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) xylanase in tomato cells. It was shown that NO is critical for PA production induced via phospholipase C (PLC) in concerted action with diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) but not for the xylanase-induced PA via phospholipase D (PLD). In order to study whether this is a general phenomenon during PAMP perception or if it is particular for xylanase, we studied the effect of the PAMP chitosan in tomato cell suspensions. We observed a rapid NO production in tomato cells treated with chitosan. Chitosan induced the formation of PA by activating both PLD and PLC/DGK. The activation of either phospholipase-mediated signaling pathway was inhibited in cells treated with the NO scavenger cPTIO. This indicates that NO is required for PA generation via both the PLD and PLC/DGK pathway during plant defense response in chitosan elicited cells. Responses downstream PA were studied. PLC inhibitors neomycin and U73122 inhibited chitosan-induced ROS production. Differences between xylanase and chitosan-induced phospholipid signaling pathways are discussed.
