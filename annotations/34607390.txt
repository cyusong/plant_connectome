['34607390', "The success of plant reproduction depends on the timely transition from the  vegetative phase to reproductive growth, a process often referred to as  flowering. Although several plant-specific transcription factors belonging to the  Teosinte Branched 1/Cycloidea/Proliferating Cell Factor (TCP) family are  reportedly involved in the regulation of flowering in Arabidopsis, the molecular  mechanisms, especially for Class I TCP members, are poorly understood. Here, we  genetically identified Class I TCP7 as a positive regulator of flowering time.  Protein interaction analysis indicated that TCP7 interacted with several Nuclear  Factor-Ys (NF-Ys), known as the 'pioneer' transcription factors; CONSTANS (CO), a  main photoperiod regulator of flowering. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS  1 (SOC1) was differentially expressed in the dominant-negative mutant of TCP7  (lcu) and the loss-of-function mutant of Class I TCP members (septuple).  Additionally, we obtained genetic and molecular evidence showing that TCP7  directly activates the flowering integrator gene, SOC1. Moreover, TCP7  synergistically activated SOC1 expression upon interacting with CO and NF-Ys  in vivo. Collectively, our results provide compelling evidence that TCP7  synergistically interacts with NF-Ys to activate the transcriptional expression  of the flowering integrator gene SOC1.", '2021 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.15524', 'Zhao']
