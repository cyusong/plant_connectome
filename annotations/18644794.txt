['18644794', 'Three reading frames called ccmF(N1), ccmF(N2), and ccmF(c) are found in the  mitochondrial genome of Arabidopsis. These sequences are similar to regions of  the bacterial gene ccmF involved in cytochrome c maturation. ccmF genes are  always absent from animal and fungi genomes but are found in mitochondrial  genomes of land plant and several evolutionary distant eukaryotes. In  Arabidopsis, ccmF(N2) despite the absence of a classical initiation codon is not  a pseudo gene. The 3 ccmF genes of Arabidopsis are expressed at the protein  level. Their products are integral proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane  with in total 11 to 13 predicted transmembrane helices. The conserved WWD domain  of CcmF(N2) is localized in the inter membrane space. The 3 CcmF proteins are all  detected in a high molecular mass complex of 500 kDa by Blue Native PAGE. Direct  interaction between CcmF(N2) and both CcmF(N1) and CcmF(C) is shown with the  yeast two-hybrid split ubiquitin system, but no interaction is observed between  CcmF(N1) and CcmF(C). Similarly, interaction is detected between CcmF(N2) and  apocytochrome c but also with apocytochrome c(1). Finally, CcmF(N1) and CcmF(N2)  both interact with CCMH previously shown to interact as well with cytochrome c.  This strengthens the hypothesis that CcmF and CCMH make a complex that performs  the assembly of heme with c-type apocytochromes in plant mitochondria.', '2008 Sep 12', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M802621200', 'Giege']
