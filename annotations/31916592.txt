Cadmium (Cd) is phytotoxic and detoxified primarily via phytochelatin (PC) complexation in Arabidopsis. Here, we explore Cd toxicity responses and defence mechanisms beyond the PC pathway using forward genetics approach. We isolated an Arabidopsis thaliana Cd-hypersensitive mutant, Cd-induced short root 1 (cdsr1) in the PC synthase mutant (cad1-3) background. Using genomic resequencing and complementation, we identified PP2A-4C as the causal gene for the mutant phenotype, which encodes a catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Root and shoot growth of cdsr1 cad1-3 and cdsr1 were more sensitive to Cd than their respective wild-type cad1-3 and Col-0. A mutant of the PP2A scaffolding subunit 1A was also more sensitive to Cd. PP2A-4C was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus and PP2A-4C expression was downregulated by Cd in cad1-3. PP2A enzyme activity was decreased in cdsr1 and cdsr1 cad1-3 under Cd stress. The expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase genes ACS2 and ACS6 was upregulated by Cd more in cad1-3 and cdsr1 cad1-3 than in Col-0 and the double mutant had a higher ACS activity. cdsr1 cad1-3 and cdsr1 overproduced ethylene under Cd stress. The results suggest that PP2A containing 1A and 4C subunits alleviates Cd-induced growth inhibition by modulating ethylene production.
