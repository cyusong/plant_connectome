Pogostone, a compound with various pharmaceutical activities, is a major constituent of the essential oil preparation called Pogostemonis Herba, which is obtained from the plant Pogostemon cablin. The biosynthesis of pogostone has not been elucidated, but 4-methylvaleryl-CoA (4MVCoA) is a likely precursor. We analyzed the distribution of pogostone in P. cablin using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and found that pogostone accumulates at high levels in the main stems and leaves of young plants. A search for the acyl-activating enzyme (AAE) that catalyzes the formation of 4MVCoA from 4-methylvaleric acid was launched, using an RNAseq-based approach to identify 31 unigenes encoding putative AAEs including the PcAAE2, the transcript profile of which shows a strong positive correlation with the distribution pattern of pogostone. The protein encoded by PcAAE2 was biochemically characterized in vitro and shown to catalyze the formation of 4MVCoA from 4-methylvaleric acid. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PcAAE2 is closely related to other AAE proteins in P. cablin and other species that are localized to the peroxisomes. However, PcAAE2 lacks a peroxisome targeting sequence 1 (PTS1) and is localized in the cytosol.
