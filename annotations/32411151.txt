Light intensity (<i>I</i>) is the most dynamic and significant environmental variable affecting photosynthesis (<i>A</i> <sub>n</sub>), stomatal conductance (<i>g</i> <sub>s</sub>), transpiration (<i>T</i> <sub>r</sub>), and water-use efficiency (WUE). Currently, studies characterizing leaf-scale WUE-<i>I</i> responses are rare and key questions have not been answered. In particular, (1) What shape does the response function take? (2) Are there maximum intrinsic (WUE<sub>i</sub>; WUE<sub>i-max</sub>) and instantaneous WUE (WUE<sub>inst</sub>; WUE<sub>inst-max</sub>) at the corresponding saturation irradiances (<i>I</i> <sub>i-sat</sub> and <i>I</i> <sub>inst-sat</sub>)? This study developed WUE<sub>i</sub>-<i>I</i> and WUE<sub>inst</sub>-<i>I</i> models sharing the same non-asymptotic function with previously published <i>A</i> <sub>n</sub>-<i>I</i> and <i>g</i> <sub>s</sub>-<i>I</i> models. Observation-modeling intercomparison was conducted for field-grown plants of soybean (C<sub>3</sub>) and grain amaranth (C<sub>4</sub>) to assess the robustness of our models versus the non-rectangular hyperbola models (NH models). Both types of models can reproduce WUE-<i>I</i> curves well over light-limited range. However, at light-saturated range, NH models overestimated WUE<sub>i-max</sub> and WUE<sub>inst-max</sub> and cannot return <i>I</i> <sub>i-sat</sub> and <i>I</i> <sub>inst-sat</sub> due to its asymptotic function. Moreover, NH models cannot describe the down-regulation of WUE induced by high light, on which our models described well. The results showed that WUE<sub>i</sub> and WUE<sub>inst</sub> increased rapidly within low range of <i>I</i>, driven by uncoupled photosynthesis and stomatal responsiveness. Initial response rapidity of WUE<sub>i</sub> was higher than WUE<sub>inst</sub> because the greatest increase of <i>A</i> <sub>n</sub> and <i>T</i> <sub>r</sub> occurred at low <i>g</i> <sub>s</sub>. C<sub>4</sub> species showed higher WUE<sub>i-max</sub> and WUE<sub>inst-max</sub> than C<sub>3</sub> species-at similar <i>I</i> <sub>i-sat</sub> and <i>I</i> <sub>inst-sat</sub>. Our intercomparison highlighted larger discrepancy between WUE<sub>i</sub>-<i>I</i> and WUE<sub>inst</sub>-<i>I</i> responses in C<sub>3</sub> than C<sub>4</sub> species, quantitatively characterizing an important advantage of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway-higher <i>A</i> <sub>n</sub> gain but lower <i>T</i> <sub>r</sub> cost per unit of <i>g</i> <sub>s</sub> change. Our models can accurately return the wealth of key quantities defining species-specific WUE-<i>I</i> responses-besides <i>A</i> <sub>n</sub>-<i>I</i> and <i>g</i> <sub>s</sub>-<i>I</i> responses. The key advantage is its robustness in characterizing these entangled responses over a wide <i>I</i> range from light-limited to light-inhibitory light intensities, through adopting the same analytical framework and the explicit and consistent definitions on these responses. Our models are of significance for physiologists and modelers-and also for breeders screening for genotypes concurrently achieving maximized photosynthesis and optimized WUE.
