In higher plants, the supply of metals such as Zn and Fe via phloem is important for the growth and physiology of young organs. However, little information is available on the speciation (chemical forms) of these metals in the phloem fluids. Because the pH of phloem fluids is slightly alkaline and the concentration of phosphate, which may bind to metals, is high, Zn and Fe in phloem fluids could be precipitated if these metals do not form complexes with some ligand compounds. In the present experiment, we examined the chemical forms of Zn and Fe in phloem sap collected from rice (Oryza sativa L.) by separating the phloem sap using size-exclusion and anion-exchange chromatography, and identifying the contents using electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The low molecular weight chemical forms of Zn and Fe were identified as Zn-nicotianamine and Fe(III)-2'-deoxymugineic acid complexes, respectively. This report is the first to identify metal-chelate complexes in rice phloem sap.

Zn: !forms! Zn-nicotianamine complex
Fe: !forms! Fe(III)-2'-deoxymugineic acid complex
phloem sap: !contains! Zn and Fe
rice: !produces! phloem sap
