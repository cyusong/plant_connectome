Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) are key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of a variety of plant specialized metabolites, including flavonoids, stilbenes, and sporopollenin, to name a few. These enzymes likely played vital roles in plant adaptation during their transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats and their colonization of specific ecological environments. Members of this supergene family have diverse functions, but how type III PKSs and their functions have evolved remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted comprehensive phylogenomics analysis of the type III PKS supergene family in 60 species representing the major plant lineages and elucidated the classification, origin, and evolutionary history of each class. Molecular evolutionary analysis of the typical chalcone synthase and stilbene synthase types revealed evidence for strong positive natural selection in both the Pinaceae and Fabaceae lineages. The positively selected sites of these proteins include residues at the catalytic tunnel entrance and homodimer interface, which might have driven the functional divergence between the two types. Our results also suggest that convergent evolution of enzymes involved in plant flavonoid biosynthesis is quite common. The results of this study provide new insights into the origin, evolution, and functional diversity of plant type III PKSs. In addition, they serve as a guide for the enzymatic engineering of plant polyketides.
