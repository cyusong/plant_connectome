['23192389', 'The forkhead-associated (FHA) domain is involved in protein-protein interaction  by recognizing a phosphothreonine epitope on target proteins. In this study, we  investigated in planta functions of the Arabidopsis FHA domain 2. AtFHA2 was  mainly localized in the nucleus. Arabidopsis fha2 null mutants grew normally  during the vegetative stage, but had severely reduced fertility during  reproductive stage. The reduced fertility was mainly caused by defective stamen  filament elongation, while female flower parts of the mutants were fertile.  Additionally, the mutants had fewer stamens than the wild type and the vegetative  organs of the mutants, such as cotyledons and leaves, had increased ploidy. These  results suggest that AtFHA2 may play a role in a signaling pathway for the  control of plant organ development.', '2013 Apr', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-012-1815-7', 'Pai']
