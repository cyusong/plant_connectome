Photosystem II (PSII) is a primary target for light-induced damage in photosynthetic protein complexes. To avoid photoinhibition, chloroplasts have evolved a repair cycle with efficient degradation of the PSII reaction center protein, D1, by the proteases FtsH and Deg. Earlier reports have described that phosphorylated D1 is a poor substrate for proteolysis, suggesting a mechanistic role for protein phosphorylation in PSII quality control, but its precise role remains elusive. STN8, a protein kinase, plays a central role in this phosphorylation process. To elucidate the relationship between phosphorylation of D1 and the protease function we assessed in this study the involvement of STN8, using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking FtsH2 [yellow variegated2 (var2)] and Deg5/Deg8 (deg5 deg8). In support of our presumption we found that phosphorylation of D1 increased more in var2. Furthermore, the coexistence of var2 and stn8 was shown to recover the delay in degradation of D1, resulting in mitigation of the high vulnerability to photoinhibition of var2. Partial D1 cleavage fragments that depended on Deg proteases tended to increase, with concomitant accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the mutants lacking STN8. We inferred that the accelerated degradation of D1 in var2 stn8 presents a tradeoff in that it improved the repair of PSII but simultaneously enhanced oxidative stress. Together, these results suggest that PSII core phosphorylation prevents undesirable cleavage of D1 by Deg proteases, which causes cytotoxicity, thereby balancing efficient linear electron flow and photo-oxidative damage. We propose that PSII core phosphorylation contributes to fine-tuned degradation of D1.
