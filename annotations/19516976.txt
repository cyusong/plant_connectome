Glass microelectrodes were inserted into Physcomitrella patens gametophyte leaves and action potentials (APs) were recorded in response to sudden illumination as well as after darkening, i.e., when the dark-induced membrane depolarization crossed a threshold. Application of 5 mM La(3+) (a calcium channel inhibitor), 10 mM TEA(+) (a potassium channel inhibitor) and increased free Ca(2+) resulted in a loss of excitability. Lack of Ca(2+) in the external medium did not prevent APs from occurring. It was concluded that during light- dark-induced excitation of Physcomitrella patens, APs might rely upon calcium influxes from the intracellular compartments. APs were not blocked by the proton pump inhibitors (DES, DCCD), although the resting potential (RP) diminished significantly.
