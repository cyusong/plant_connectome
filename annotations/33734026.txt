Lateral root (LR) branches from primary root. LR is vital for plants acquiring water and nutrients from soil, especially under stress conditions. LR development involves the complicated signaling network, which has not yet been fully understood. Melatonin, a novel endogenous plant regulator, plays a role in the regulation of LR development. However, we still have limited knowledge about melatonin-modulated signaling during LR development. Our recent study identifies that reactive oxygen species (ROS) acts as downstream signaling of melatonin to facilitate LR development. The recently identified receptor of melatonin in plants controls a signaling module involving G protein, ROS, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Based on these findings, we propose a novel signaling network for LR development controlled by melatonin.
