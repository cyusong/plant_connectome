WRKY transcription factor participates in plant growth and development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. <i>Arachis duranensis</i>, a turfgrass, has high drought tolerance, yet little is known about <i>AdWRKYs</i> response to drought stress in <i>A. duranensis</i>. In this study, RNA-seq identified five <i>AdWRKYs</i>, including <i>AdWRKY18</i>, <i>AdWRKY40</i>, <i>AdWRKY42</i>, <i>AdWRKY56</i>, and <i>AdWRKY64</i>, which were upregulated under drought stress. Orthologous relationships between <i>AdWRKYs</i> and <i>Arabidopsis WRKY</i> were determined to predict the regulatory networks of the five AdWRKYs based on AtWRKYs. Additionally, protein-protein interactions were predicted using differentially expressed proteins from RNA-seq. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that <i>AdWRKY40</i> was upregulated, while <i>AdWRKY42</i>, <i>AdWRKY56</i>, and <i>AdWRKY64</i> were downregulated at different time-points under drought stress. The predicted regulatory networks showed that AdWRKY40 activates <i>COR47</i>, <i>RD21</i>, and <i>RD29A</i> expression under drought stress. Besides, AdWRKY56 regulated <i>CesA8</i> under drought stress. Aradu.YIQ80 (NAC019) interacted with AdWRKY40, AdWRKY42, AdWRKY56, and AdWRKY64, while Aradu.Z5H58 (NAC055) interacted with AdWRKY42 and AdWRKY64 under drought stress. This study used <i>Arabidopsis</i> to assess <i>AdWRKYs</i> function and regulatory networks, providing a basis for understanding drought tolerance in <i>A. duranensis</i>.
