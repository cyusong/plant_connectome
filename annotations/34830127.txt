Electromagnetic energy is the backbone of wireless communication systems, and its progressive use has resulted in impacts on a wide range of biological systems. The consequences of electromagnetic energy absorption on plants are insufficiently addressed. In the agricultural area, electromagnetic-wave irradiation has been used to develop crop varieties, manage insect pests, monitor fertilizer efficiency, and preserve agricultural produce. According to different frequencies and wavelengths, electromagnetic waves are typically divided into eight spectral bands, including audio waves, radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. In this review, among these electromagnetic waves, effects of millimeter waves, ultraviolet, and gamma rays on plants are outlined, and their response mechanisms in plants through proteomic approaches are summarized. Furthermore, remarkable advancements of irradiating plants with electromagnetic waves, especially ultraviolet, are addressed, which shed light on future research in the electromagnetic field.
