Capsicum (pepper) is known for its poor seed germination, particularly seed longevity is usually much shorter than other Solanaceae. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are mostly unknown in these species. The present study examines the differences in seed longevity among Capsicum species and varietal types. Feral or less domesticated species, such as Capsicum chinense and particularly Capsicum frutescens, showed higher germination rates than the more domesticated Capsicum annuum after accelerated seed aging treatments. In addition, variability was detected in the expression of genes involved in the response to seed deterioration. The differences observed in ASPG1 expression led us to study the seed protein profile in dry and germinating seeds. Seed storage protein mobilization during germination was faster in seed aging-resistant genotypes. Similarly, the transcriptional change observed for the orthologous gene of the trans-species regulator AtHB25 prompted us to study the structure and molecular components of the seed coat in peppers. All the Capsicum pepper accessions analyzed presented very lignified testa and we observed a positive correlation between the amount of lignin and seed viability. Our results provide essential information to explain the poor germination observed in pepper seeds and provide an experimental framework for future improvements in this important character.
