['17521409', 'In animals, organic cation/carnitine transporters (OCTs) are involved in  homeostasis and distribution of various small endogenous amines (e.g. carnitine,  choline) and detoxification of xenobiotics such as nicotine. Here, we describe  the characterization of AtOCT1, an Arabidopsis protein that shares most of the  conserved features of mammalian plasma membrane OCTs. Transient expression of an  AtOCT1::GFP fusion protein in onion epidermal cells and Arabidopsis protoplasts  supported localization in the plasmalemma. AtOCT1 functionally complemented the  Deltacit2/Deltaagp2p yeast strain that is defective in plasma membrane carnitine  transport. Disruption of AtOCT1 in an Arabidopsis oct1-1 knockout mutant affected  both the expression of carnitine-related genes and the developmental defects  induced by exogenous carnitine. RT-PCR and promoter-uidA fusion analysis showed  that AtOCT1 was expressed in vascular tissues of various organs and at sites of  lateral root formation. Correlating with this expression pattern, oct1-1  seedlings grown in vitro exhibited a higher degree of root branching than the  wild-type, showing that the disruption of AtOCT1 affected root development under  certain conditions.', '2007 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03131.x', 'Hartmann']
