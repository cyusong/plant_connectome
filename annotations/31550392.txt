Uniform growth of the main shoot and tillers significantly influences rice plant architecture and grain yield. The WUSCHEL-related homeobox transcription factor DWT1 is a key regulator of this important agronomic trait, disruption of which causes enhanced main shoot dominance and tiller dwarfism by an unknown mechanism. Here, we have used yeast-two-hybrid screening to identify OsPIP5K1, a member of the rice phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase family, as a protein that interacts with DWT1. Cytological analyses confirmed that DWT1 induces accumulation of OsPIP5K1 and its product PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> , a phosphoinositide secondary messenger, in nuclear bodies. Mutation of OsPIP5K1 compounds the dwarf dwt1 phenotype but abolishes the main shoot dominance. Conversely, overexpression of OsPIP5K1 partially rescues dwt1 developmental defects. Furthermore, we showed that DWL2, the homologue of DWT1, is also able to interact with OsPIP5K1 and shares partial functional redundancy with DWT1 in controlling rice uniformity. Overall, our data suggest that nuclear localised OsPIP5K1 acts with DWT1 and/or DWL2 to coordinate the uniform growth of rice shoots, likely to be through nuclear phosphoinositide signals, and provides insights into the regulation of rice uniformity via a largely unexplored plant nuclear signalling pathway.
