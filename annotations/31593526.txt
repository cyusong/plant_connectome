<i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>vasinfectum</i> is an important plant pathogen responsible for vascular wilt disease on cotton. Members of this group are known to carry supernumerary chromosomes that encode virulence factors. We sequenced the genomes of five <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>vasinfectum</i> isolates, including the genome of a representative of the highly virulent genotype race 4, at a high coverage to assemble reference-quality genomes. These genomes provide a necessary resource for comparative genomic analyses to identify genes or genome features that are involved in pathogenicity on cotton and may ultimately be used to identify improved management strategies.
