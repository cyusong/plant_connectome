Over the last decade, several studies have revealed the enormous potential of RNA-silencing strategies as a potential alternative to conventional pesticides for plant protection. We have previously shown that targeted gene silencing mediated by an <i>in planta</i> expression of non-coding inhibitory double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) can protect host plants against various diseases with unprecedented efficiency. In addition to the generation of RNA-silencing (RNAi) signals <i>in planta</i>, plants can be protected from pathogens, and pests by spray-applied RNA-based biopesticides. Despite the striking efficiency of RNA-silencing-based technologies holds for agriculture, the molecular mechanisms underlying spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS) strategies are virtually unresolved, a requirement for successful future application in the field. Based on our previous work, we predict that the molecular mechanism of SIGS is controlled by the fungal-silencing machinery. In this study, we used SIGS to compare the silencing efficiencies of computationally-designed vs. manually-designed dsRNA constructs targeting <i>ARGONAUTE</i> and <i>DICER</i> genes of <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> (<i>Fg</i>). We found that targeting key components of the fungal RNAi machinery via SIGS could protect barley leaves from <i>Fg</i> infection and that the manual design of dsRNAs resulted in higher gene-silencing efficiencies than the tool-based design. Moreover, our results indicate the possibility of cross-kingdom RNA silencing in the <i>Fg</i>-barley interaction, a phenomenon in which sRNAs operate as effector molecules to induce gene silencing between species from different kingdoms, such as a plant host and their interacting pathogens.
