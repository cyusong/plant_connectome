['17556585', 'Root hairs and rhizoids are cells with rooting functions in land plants. We  describe two basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that control root hair  development in the sporophyte (2n) of the angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana and  rhizoid development in the gametophytes (n) of the bryophyte Physcomitrella  patens. The phylogeny of land plants supports the hypothesis that early land  plants were bryophyte-like and possessed a dominant gametophyte and later the  sporophyte rose to dominance. If this hypothesis is correct, our data suggest  that the increase in morphological complexity of the sporophyte body in the  Paleozoic resulted at least in part from the recruitment of regulatory genes from  gametophyte to sporophyte.', '2007 Jun 8', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1142618', 'Dolan']
