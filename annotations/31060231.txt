Three Apiaceae species <i>Ledebouriella seseloides</i>, <i>Peucedanum japonicum</i>, and <i>Glehnia littoralis</i> are used as Asian herbal medicines, with the confusingly similar common name "Bang-poong". We characterized the complete chloroplast (cp) genomes and 45S nuclear ribosomal DNA (45S nrDNA) sequences of two accessions for each species. The complete cp genomes of <i>G. littoralis</i>, <i>L. seseloides</i>, and <i>P. japonicum</i> were 147,467, 147,830, and 164,633 bp, respectively. Compared to the other species, the <i>P. japonicum</i> cp genome had a huge inverted repeat expansion and a segmental inversion. The 45S nrDNA cistron sequences of the three species were almost identical in size and structure. Despite the structural variation in the <i>P. japonicum</i> cp genome, phylogenetic analysis revealed that <i>G. littoralis</i> diverged 5-6 million years ago (Mya), while <i>P. japonicum</i> diverged from <i>L. seseloides</i> only 2-3 Mya. Abundant copy number variations including tandem repeats, insertion/deletions, and single nucleotide polymorphisms, were found at the interspecies level. Intraspecies-level polymorphism was also found for <i>L. seseloides</i> and <i>G. littoralis</i>. We developed nine PCR barcode markers to authenticate all three species. This study characterizes the genomic differences between <i>L. seseloides</i>, <i>P. japonicum</i>, and <i>G. littoralis</i>; provides a method of species identification; and sheds light on the evolutionary history of these three species.
