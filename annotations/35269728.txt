Salt stress is a major adverse abiotic factor seriously affecting fruit tree growth and development. It ultimately lowers fruit quality and reduces yield. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is an important cell membrane component that is critical for cell structure and membrane stability maintenance. In this study, we found that the addition of external PC sources significantly increased the tolerance of one-year-old peach trees, <i>Prunus persica</i> (L.) Batsch., to salt stress and attenuated their damage. The effect of exogenous application of 200 mg/L PC exerted the most significant positive effect. Its use caused seedling leaf stomatal opening, contributing to normal gas exchange. Moreover, beneficial effects were exerted also to the root system, which grew normally under salt stress. Meanwhile, phospholipase D activity in the cell was promoted. The production of phosphatidic acid (PA) was enhanced by increased decomposition of phospholipids; PA serves as a secondary messenger involved in plant biological process regulation and the reduction in the reactive oxygen species- and peroxide-induced damage caused by salt stress. The possible mechanism of action is via promoted plant osmotic regulation and tolerance to salt stress, reducing salt stress-induced injury to plants.
