We utilized transcriptional profiling to identify genes associated with nodule development in soybean. Many of the candidate genes were predicted to be involved in processes such as defense, metabolism, transcriptional regulation, oxidation, or iron storage. Here, we describe the detailed characterization of one specific class of genes that encode the enzyme lipoxygenase (LOX). The LOX9 and LOX10 genes identified by microarray analysis represent novel soybean LOXs expressed in developing nodules. LOX expression during nodulation was relatively complex, with at least eight different LOX genes expressed in soybean nodules. Histochemical analyses utilizing LOX9 promoter::beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion constructs in transgenic soybean hairy roots suggest that this gene is involved in the growth and development of specific cells within the root and nodules. In soybean roots, LOX9 was expressed specifically in the developing phloem. In nodules, the expression of LOX9 was correlated with the development of cells in the vasculature and lenticels. The use of RNAi in transgenic hairy roots reduced LOX expression by approximately 95%. Despite this significant reduction in LOX expression, there was no detectable effect on the development of roots or nodules. Our findings are discussed with respect to the potential function of LOXs in nodulation.
