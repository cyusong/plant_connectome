['12070094', 'Continuous organ formation from the shoot apical meristem requires the  integration of two functions: a set of undifferentiated, pluripotent stem cells  is maintained at the very tip of the meristem, while their daughter cells in the  periphery initiate organ primordia. The homeobox genes WUSCHEL (WUS) and  SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) encode two major regulators of meristem formation and  maintenance in Arabidopsis, yet their interaction in meristem regulation is  presently unclear. Here, we have addressed this question using loss- and  gain-of-function approaches. We show that stem cell specification by WUS does not  require STM activity. Conversely, STM suppresses differentiation independently of  WUS and is required and sufficient to promote cell division. Consistent with  their independent and distinct phenotypic effects, ectopic WUS and STM activities  induce the expression of different downstream target genes. Finally, the pathways  regulated by WUS and STM appear to converge in the suppression of  differentiation, since coexpression of both genes produced a synergistic effect,  and increased WUS activity could partly compensate for loss of STM function.  These results suggest that WUS and STM share labour in the shoot apical meristem:  WUS specifies a subset of cells in the centre as stem cells, while STM is  required to suppress differentiation throughout the meristem dome, thus allowing  stem cell daughters to be amplified before they are incorporated into organs.', '2002 Jul', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.129.13.3195', 'Laux']
