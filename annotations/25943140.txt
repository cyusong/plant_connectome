Eukaryotic organisms have canonical histones and a number of histone variants that perform specialized functions and confer particular structural properties to the nucleosomes that contain them. The histone H2A family comprises several variants, with H2A.Z being the most evolutionarily conserved. This variant is essential in eukaryotes and has emerged as a key player in chromatin function, performing an essential role in gene transcription and genome stability. During recent years, biochemical, genetic and genomic studies have begun to uncover the role of several ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes in H2A.Z deposition and removal. These ATPase complexes are widely conserved from yeast to mammals. In Arabidopsis there are homologs for most of the subunits of these complexes, and their functions are just beginning to be unveiled. In this review, we discuss the major contributions made in relation to the biology of the H2A.Z in plants, and more specifically concerning the function of this histone variant in the transition from vegetative to reproductive development. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the H2A.Z-mediated modulation of the floral transition, and thermosensory flowering responses in particular, are discussed. The emerging picture shows that plants contain chromatin-remodeling complexes related to those involved in modulating the dynamics of H2A.Z in other eukaryotes, but their precise biochemical nature remains elusive.
