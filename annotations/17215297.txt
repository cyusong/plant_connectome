['17215297', 'In plants, the developmental mechanisms that regulate the positioning of lateral  organs along the primary root are currently unknown. We present evidence on how  lateral root initiation is controlled in a spatiotemporal manner in the model  plant Arabidopsis thaliana. First, lateral roots are spaced along the main axis  in a regular left-right alternating pattern that correlates with gravity-induced  waving and depends on AUX1, an auxin influx carrier essential for gravitropic  response. Second, we found evidence that the priming of pericycle cells for  lateral root initiation might take place in the basal meristem, correlating with  elevated auxin sensitivity in this part of the root. This local auxin  responsiveness oscillates with peaks of expression at regular intervals of 15  hours. Each peak in the auxin-reporter maximum correlates with the formation of a  consecutive lateral root. Third, auxin signaling in the basal meristem triggers  pericycle cells for lateral root initiation prior to the action of  INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID14 (SOLITARY ROOT).', '2007 Feb', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.02753', 'Beeckman']
