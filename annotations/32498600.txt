The control of gynecium development in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> by the auxin response factor ETTIN (ETT) correlates with a reduction in the methylesterification of cell-wall pectins and a decrease in cell-wall stiffness in the valve tissues of the ovary. Here, we determine the list of genes rapidly regulated following the <i>in-vivo</i> activation of an ETT fusion protein, and show these to be significantly enriched in genes encoding cell-wall proteins, including several pectin methylesterases (PMEs) and pectin methylesterase inhibitors (PMEIs). We also perform a genome-wide scan for potential ETT-binding sites, and incorporate the results of this procedure into a comparison of datasets, derived using four distinct methods, to identify genes regulated directly or indirectly by ETT. We conclude from our combined analyses that PMEIs are likely to be key actors that mediate the regulation of gynecium development by ETT, while ETT may simultaneously regulate PMEs to prevent exaggerated developmental effects from the regulation of PMEIs. We also postulate the existence of one or more rapidly-acting intermediate factors in the transcriptional regulation of PMEs and PMEIs by ETT.
