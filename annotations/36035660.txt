Panicle number is directly related to rice yield, so panicle detection and counting has always been one of the most important scientific research topics. Panicle counting is a challenging task due to many factors such as high density, high occlusion, and large variation in size, shape, posture et.al. Deep learning provides state-of-the-art performance in object detection and counting. Generally, the large images need to be resized to fit for the video memory. However, small panicles would be missed if the image size of the original field rice image is extremely large. In this paper, we proposed a rice panicle detection and counting method based on deep learning which was especially designed for detecting rice panicles in rice field images with large image size. Different object detectors were compared and YOLOv5 was selected with MAPE of 3.44% and accuracy of 92.77%. Specifically, we proposed a new method for removing repeated detections and proved that the method outperformed the existing NMS methods. The proposed method was proved to be robust and accurate for counting panicles in field rice images of different illumination, rice accessions, and image input size. Also, the proposed method performed well on UAV images. In addition, an open-access and user-friendly web portal was developed for rice researchers to use the proposed method conveniently.
