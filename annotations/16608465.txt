To estimate the phylogenetic relationship of polyploid Elymus in Triticeae, nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplast trnL-F sequences of 45 Elymus accessions containing various genomes were analysed with those of five Pseudoroegneria (St), two Hordeum (H), three Agropyron (P) and two Australopyrum (W) accessions. The ITS sequences revealed a close phylogenetic relationship between the polyploid Elymus and species from the other genera. The ITS and trnL-F trees indicated considerable differentiation of the StY genome species. The trnL-F sequences revealed an especially close relationship of Pseudoroegneria to all Elymus species included. Both the ITS and trnL-F trees suggested multiple origins and recurrent hybridization of Elymus species. The results suggested that: the St, H, P, and W genomes in polyploid Elymus were donated by Pseudoroegneria, Hordeum, Agropyron and Australopyrum, respectively, and the St and Y genomes may have originated from the same ancestor; Pseudoroegneria was the maternal donor of the polyploid Elymus; and some Elymus species showed multiple origin and experienced recurrent hybridization.

Pseudoroegneria: !donates! StY genome
Pseudoroegneria: !maternal donor of! polyploid Elymus
Hordeum: !donates! St genome
Agropyron: !donates! P genome
Australopyrum: !donates! W genome
StY genome: !originates from! same ancestor
Elymus species: !experience! recurrent hybridization
