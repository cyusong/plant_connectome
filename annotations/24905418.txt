Long-chain base phosphates (LCBPs) have been correlated with amounts of crucial biological processes ranging from cell proliferation to apoptosis in animals. However, their functions in plants remain largely unknown. Here, we report that LCBPs, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and phytosphingosine-1-phosphate (Phyto-S1P), modulate pollen tube growth in a concentration-dependent bi-phasic manner. The pollen tube growth in the stylar transmitting tissue was promoted by SPHK1 overexpression (SPHK1-OE) but dampened by SPHK1 knockdown (SPHK1-KD) compared with wild-type of Arabidopsis; however, there was no detectable effect on in vitro pollen tube growth caused by misexpression of SPHK1. Interestingly, exogenous S1P or Phyto-S1P applications could increase the pollen tube growth rate in SPHK1-OE, SPHK1-KD and wild-type of Arabidopsis. Calcium ion (Ca(2+) )-imaging analysis showed that S1P triggered a remarkable increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration in pollen. Extracellular S1P induced hyperpolarization-activated Ca(2+) currents in the pollen plasma membrane, and the Ca(2+) current activation was mediated by heterotrimeric G proteins. Moreover, the S1P-induced increase of cytosolic free Ca(2+) inhibited the influx of potassium ions in pollen tubes. Our findings suggest that LCBPs functions in a signaling cascade that facilitates Ca(2+) influx and modulates pollen tube growth.
