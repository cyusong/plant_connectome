['12532018', 'Condensed tannins (CTs) are flavonoid oligomers, many of which have beneficial  effects on animal and human health. The flavanol (-)-epicatechin is a component  of many CTs and contributes to flavor and astringency in tea and wine. We show  that the BANYULS (BAN) genes from Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula  encode anthocyanidin reductase, which converts anthocyanidins to their  corresponding 2,3-cis-flavan-3-ols. Ectopic expression of BAN in tobacco flower  petals and Arabidopsis leaves results in loss of anthocyanins and accumulation of  CTs.', '2003 Jan 17', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1078540', 'Dixon']
