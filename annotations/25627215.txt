Actinorhizal symbioses are mutualistic interactions between plants and the soil bacteria Frankia spp. that lead to the formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules. The plant hormone auxin has been suggested to play a role in the mechanisms that control the establishment of this symbiosis in the actinorhizal tree Casuarina glauca. Here, we analyzed the role of auxin signaling in Frankia spp.-infected cells. Using a dominant-negative version of an endogenous auxin-signaling regulator, INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID7, we established that inhibition of auxin signaling in these cells led to increased nodulation and, as a consequence, to higher nitrogen fixation per plant even if nitrogen fixation per nodule mass was similar to that in the wild type. Our results suggest that auxin signaling in Frankia spp.-infected cells is involved in the long-distance regulation of nodulation in actinorhizal symbioses.
