Naturally occurring heritable variation provides a fundamental resource to reveal the genetic and molecular bases of traits in forward genetic studies. Here, we report the molecular basis of the differences in the four alleles E<sup>1</sup>, E<sup>2</sup>, E<sup>3</sup>, and e of the FATTY ACID ELONGATION1 (FAE1) gene controlling high, medium, low, and zero erucic content in yellow mustard (Sinapis alba). E<sup>1</sup> represents a fully functional allele with a coding DNA sequence (CDS) of 1521 bp and a promoter adjacent to the CDS. The null allele e resulted from an insertional disruption in the CDS by Sal-PIF, a 3100-bp PIF/Harbinger-like DNA transposon, whereas E<sup>2</sup> and E<sup>3</sup> originated from the insertion of Sal-T1, a 4863-bp Copia-like retrotransposon, in the 5' untranslated region. E<sup>3</sup> was identical to E<sup>2</sup> but showed cytosine methylation in the promoter region and was thus an epiallele having a further reduction in expression. The coding regions of E<sup>2</sup> and E<sup>3</sup> also contained five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) not present in E<sup>1</sup>, but expression studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated that these SNPs did not affect enzyme functionality. These results demonstrate a comprehensive molecular framework for the interplay of transposon insertion, SNP/indel mutation, and epigenetic modification influencing the broad range of natural genetic variation in plants.
