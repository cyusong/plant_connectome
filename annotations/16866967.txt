In this paper, we investigate the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in plant phosphorus nutrition. We develop a mathematical model which quantitatively assesses the contribution of external fungal hyphae to plant phosphate uptake. We derive an equation for solute uptake by a growing fungal mycelium which we couple with a model for root uptake. We analyse the model using nondimensionalization and numerical simulations. Simulations predict that removal of phosphate from soil is dominated by hyphal uptake as opposed to root uptake. Model analysis shows that the depletion zones around hyphae overlap within 8 h and that the transfer between fungus and root is a critical step for the behaviour of phosphorus within the mycelial phase. We also show that the volume fraction of mycelium is negligibly small in comparison to other soil phases. This is the first model to quantify the contribution of mycorrhizal fungi to plant phosphate uptake. A full data set for model parametrization and validation is not currently available. Therefore, more complete sets of experimental measurements are necessary to make this model more applicable.
