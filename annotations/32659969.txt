Wood, which is mainly composed of lignified secondary cell wall, is the most abundant biomass in woody plants. Previous studies have revealed that R2R3-type MYB transcription factors are important regulators of the formation of the secondary cell wall in vascular plants. In this study, we isolated the R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene <i>PtoMYB055</i>, which is mainly expressed in xylem and phloem tissue, from <i>Populus tomentosa</i> and demonstrate that PtoMYB055 is a key regulator of lignin biosynthesis. PtoMYB055 as a transcriptional activator is localized to the nucleus. Overexpression of <i>PtoMYB055</i> upregulates expression of lignin biosynthetic genes in transgenic poplar plants, resulting in ectopic deposition of lignin in phloem tissue and an increase in thickness of the secondary cell wall. In sum, PtoMYB055 is a transcriptional activator that is involved in regulating lignin biosynthesis during the formation of the secondary cell wall in poplar.
