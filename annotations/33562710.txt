In angiosperm seeds, the endosperm develops to varying degrees and accumulates different types of storage compounds remobilized by the seedling during early post-germinative growth. Whereas the molecular mechanisms controlling the metabolism of starch and seed-storage proteins in the endosperm of cereal grains are relatively well characterized, the regulation of oil metabolism in the endosperm of developing and germinating oilseeds has received particular attention only more recently, thanks to the emergence and continuous improvement of analytical techniques allowing the evaluation, within a spatial context, of gene activity on one side, and lipid metabolism on the other side. These studies represent a fundamental step toward the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing oil metabolism in this particular tissue. In particular, they highlight the importance of endosperm-specific transcriptional controls for determining original oil compositions usually observed in this tissue. In the light of this research, the biological functions of oils stored in the endosperm of seeds then appear to be more diverse than simply constituting a source of carbon made available for the germinating seedling.
