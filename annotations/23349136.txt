Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a key event in many fundamental cellular processes. Under stressful conditions, many thylakoid membrane proteins in photosynthetic apparatus of higher plants undergo rapid phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to environmental changes. CP29 is the most frequently phosphorylated protein among three minor antennae complexes in higher plants. CP29 phosphorylation in dicotyledons has been known for several decades and is well characterized. However, CP29 phosphorylation in monocotyledons is less studied and appears to have a different phosphorylation pattern. In this review, we discuss recent advancements in CP29 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation studies and its physiological significance under environmental stresses in higher plants, especially in the monocotyledonous crops. Physiologically, the phosphorylation of CP29 is likely to be a prerequisite for state transitions and the disassembly of photosystem II supercomplexes, but not involved in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). CP29 is phosphorylated in monocots exposed to environmental cues, with its subsequent lateral migration from grana stacks to stroma lamellae. However, neither CP29 phosphorylation nor its lateral migration occurs in dicotyledonous plants after drought, cold, or salt stress. Since the molecular mechanisms of differential CP29 phosphorylation under stresses are not fully understood, this review provides insights for future studies regarding the physiological function of CP29 reversible phosphorylation.
