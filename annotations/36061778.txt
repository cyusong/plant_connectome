Abiotic stress is an important factor affecting the normal growth and development of plants and crop yield. To reduce the impact of abiotic adversity on cotton growth and development, the material basis of cotton resistance and its physiological functions are analyzed at the molecular level. At the same time, the use of genetic engineering methods to recombine resistance genes has become a hot spot in cotton resistance research. This paper provides an overviews of the resistance mechanism of cotton against the threat of non-biological adversity, as well as the research progress of osmoregulation-related genes, protein-acting genes, and transcription regulatory factor genes in recent years, and outlines the explored gene resources in cotton resistance genetic engineering, with the aim to provide ideas and reference bases for future research on cotton resistance.
