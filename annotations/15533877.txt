Plant photosynthesis channels some of the most highly reactive intermediates in biology, in a way that captures a large fraction of their energy to power the plant. A viable photosynthetic apparatus must not only be efficient and robust machinery, but also well integrated into the plant's biochemical and physiological networks. This requires flexibility in its responses to the dramatically changing environmental conditions and biochemical demands. First, the output of the energy-storing light reactions must match the demands of plant metabolism. Second, regulation of the antenna must be flexible to allow responses to diverse challenges that could result in excess light capture and subsequent photoinhibition. Evidence is presented for the interplay of two types of mechanistic flexibility, one that modulates the relative sensitivity of antenna down-regulation to electron flow, and the other, which primarily modulates the output ratio of ATP/NADPH, but also contributes to down-regulation.
