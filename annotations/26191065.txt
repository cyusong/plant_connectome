['26191065', 'The Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein (TCTP) is a central regulator of  cell proliferation and differentiation in animals, and probably also in plants.  Arabidopsis harbors two TCTP genes, AtTCTP1 (At3g16640), which is an important  mitotic regulator, and AtTCTP2 (At3g05540), which is considered a pseudogene.  Nevertheless, we have obtained evidence suggesting that this gene is functional.  Indeed, a T-DNA insertion mutant, SALK_045146, displays a lethal phenotype during  early rosette stage. Also, both the AtTCTP2 promoter and structural gene are  functional, and heterozygous plants show delayed development. AtTCTP1 cannot  compensate for the loss of AtTCTP2, since the accumulation levels of the AtTCTP1  transcript are even higher in heterozygous plants than in wild-type plants. Leaf  explants transformed with Agrobacterium rhizogenes harboring AtTCTP2, but not  AtTCTP1, led to whole plant regeneration with a high frequency. Insertion of a  sequence present in AtTCTP1 but absent in AtTCTP2 demonstrates that it suppresses  the capacity for plant regeneration; also, this phenomenon is enhanced by the  presence of TCTP (AtTCTP1 or 2) in the nuclei of root cells. This confirms that  AtTCTP2 is not a pseudogene and suggests the involvement of certain TCTP isoforms  in vegetative reproduction in some plant species.', '2015', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2015.00468', 'Ruiz-Medrano']
