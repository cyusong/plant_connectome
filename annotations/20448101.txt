Functions of isoamylase-type starch-debranching enzyme (ISA) proteins and complexes in maize (Zea mays) endosperm were characterized. Wild-type endosperm contained three high molecular mass ISA complexes resolved by gel permeation chromatography and native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two complexes of approximately 400 kD contained both ISA1 and ISA2, and an approximately 300-kD complex contained ISA1 but not ISA2. Novel mutations of sugary1 (su1) and isa2, coding for ISA1 and ISA2, respectively, were used to develop one maize line with ISA1 homomer but lacking heteromeric ISA and a second line with one form of ISA1/ISA2 heteromer but no homomeric enzyme. The mutations were su1-P, which caused an amino acid substitution in ISA1, and isa2-339, which was caused by transposon insertion and conditioned loss of ISA2. In agreement with the protein compositions, all three ISA complexes were missing in an ISA1-null line, whereas only the two higher molecular mass forms were absent in the ISA2-null line. Both su1-P and isa2-339 conditioned near-normal starch characteristics, in contrast to ISA-null lines, indicating that either homomeric or heteromeric ISA is competent for starch biosynthesis. The homomer-only line had smaller, more numerous granules. Thus, a function of heteromeric ISA not compensated for by homomeric enzyme affects granule initiation or growth, which may explain evolutionary selection for ISA2. ISA1 was required for the accumulation of ISA2, which is regulated posttranscriptionally. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that the ISA1 transcript level was elevated in tissues where starch is synthesized and low during starch degradation, whereas ISA2 transcript was relatively abundant during periods of either starch biosynthesis or catabolism.
