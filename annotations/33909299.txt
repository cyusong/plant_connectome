['33909299', 'Plant architecture is controlled by several endogenous signals including hormones  and sugars. However, only little information is known about the nature and roles  of the sugar signalling pathways in this process. Here we test whether the sugar  signalling pathway mediated by HEXOKINASE1 (HXK1) is involved in the control of  shoot branching. To test the involvement of HXK1 in shoot branching and in the  hormonal network controlling this process, we modulated the HXK1 pathway using  physiological and genetic approaches in rose, pea and arabidopsis.  Mannose-induced HXK signalling triggered bud outgrowth in rose and pea. In  arabidopsis, both HXK1 deficiency and defoliation led to decreased shoot  branching and conferred hypersensitivity to auxin. Complementation of the HXK1  knockout mutant gin2 with a catalytically inactive HXK1, restored shoot branching  to the wild-type level. HXK1-deficient plants displayed decreased cytokinin  levels and increased expression of MAX2, which is required for strigolactone  signalling. The branching phenotype of HXK1-deficient plants could be partly  restored by cytokinin treatment and strigolactone deficiency could override the  negative impact of HXK1 deficiency on shoot branching. Our observations  demonstrate that HXK1 signalling contributes to the regulation of shoot branching  and interacts with hormones to modulate plant architecture.', '2021 Aug', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.17427', 'ORCID:']
