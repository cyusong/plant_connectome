Pollination services underpin sustainability of restored ecosystems. Yet, outside of agri-environments, effective restoration of pollinator services in ecological restoration has received little attention. This deficiency in the knowledge needed to restore pollinator capability represents a major liability in restoration programs, particularly in regions where specialist invertebrate and vertebrate pollinators exist, such as global biodiversity hotspots. When compounded with the likely negative impacts of climate change on pollination services, the need to understand and manage pollinator services in restoration becomes paramount.
