To illustrate the molecular mechanism of mycoheterotrophic interactions between orchids and fungi, we assembled chromosome-level reference genome of Gastrodia menghaiensis (Orchidaceae) and analyzed the genomes of two species of Gastrodia. Our analyses indicated that the genomes of Gastrodia are globally diminished in comparison to autotrophic orchids, even compared to Cuscuta (a plant parasite). Genes involved in arbuscular mycorrhizae colonization were found in genomes of Gastrodia, and many of the genes involved biological interaction between Gatrodia and symbiotic microbionts are more numerous than in photosynthetic orchids. The highly expressed genes for fatty acid and ammonium root transporters suggest that fungi receive material from orchids, although most raw materials flow from the fungi. Many nuclear genes (e.g. biosynthesis of aromatic amino acid L-tryptophan) supporting plastid functions are expanded compared to photosynthetic orchids, an indication of the importance of plastids even in totally mycoheterotrophic species. Gastrodia menghaiensis has the smallest proteome thus far among angiosperms. Many of the genes involved biological interaction between Gatrodia and symbiotic microbionts are more numerous than in photosynthetic orchids.
