The use of genetic resources in breeding is considered critical to ensure future selection gain, but the absence of important adaptation genes often masks the breeding value of genetic resources for grain yield. Testing genetic resources in a hybrid background has been proposed as a solution to obtain unbiased estimates of breeding values for grain yield. In our study, we evaluated the suitability of European wheat elite lines for implementing this hybrid strategy, focusing on maximizing seed yield in hybrid production and reducing masking effects due to susceptibility to lodging, yellow rust, and leaf rust of genetic resources. Over a 3-year period, 63 wheat elite female lines were crossed with eight male plant genetic resources in a multi-environment field experiment to evaluate seed yield on the female side. Then, the resulting hybrids and their parents were tested for plant height, lodging, and susceptibility to yellow rust and leaf rust in a further field experiment at multiple locations. We found that seed yield was strongly influenced by the elite wheat line choice in addition to environment and observed substantial differences among elite tester lines in their ability to reduce susceptibility to lodging, yellow rust, and leaf rust when the hybrid strategy was implemented. Consequently, breeders can significantly increase the amount of hybrid seed produced in wide crosses through appropriate tester choice and adapt genetic resources of wheat with the hybrid strategy to the modern cropping system.
