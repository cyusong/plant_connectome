['19066902', 'MYB transcription factors play important roles in various developmental processes  in plants. Here we report the characterization of AtMYB118, a gene encoding a  putative R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, which expresses predominantly in  siliques. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis and in situ hybridization showed  that the transcripts of AtMYB118 were mainly detected in developing embryos.  Constitutive over-expression of AtMYB118 resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes,  including dwarfism, compact rosettes, backward curly-leaves, smaller flowers and  siliques, and premature seed dehydration at the tip of siliques. Microarray  analysis showed that many genes encoding proteins accumulated during  embryogenesis were remarkably up-regulated in AtMYB118-over-expressed transgenic  plants, including late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEA proteins), storage  proteins, seed maturation proteins, and proteins related with seed dehydration,  desiccation and ABA signaling pathway. These results suggest that AtMYB118 may  play an important role during embryogenesis and seed maturation.', '2009 Mar', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-008-0644-4', 'Gu']
