['12954765', 'Animal proteins that contain a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) are suggested to  provide a link between DNA methylation, chromatin remodelling and gene silencing.  However, some MBD proteins reside in chromatin remodelling complexes, but do not  have specific affinity for methylated DNA. It has recently been shown that the  Arabidopsis genome contains 12 putative genes encoding proteins with domains  similar to MBD, of which at least three bind symmetrically methylated DNA. Using  a bioinformatics approach, we have identified additional domains in a number of  these proteins and, on this basis and extended sequence similarity, divided the  proteins into subgroups. Using RT-PCR we show that 10 of the AtMBD genes are  active and differentially expressed in diverse tissues. To investigate the  biological significance of AtMBD proteins, we have transformed Arabidopsis with a  construct aimed at RNA interference with expression of the AtMBD11 gene, normally  active in most tissues. The resulting 35S::AtMBD11-RNAi plants displayed a  variety of phenotypic effects, including aerial rosettes, serrated leaves,  abnormal position of flowers, fertility problems and late flowering. Arabidopsis  lines with reduced expression of genes involved in chromatin remodelling and  transgene silencing show similar phenotypes. Our results suggest an important  role for AtMBD proteins in plant development.', '2003 Sep 15', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkg735', 'Aalen']
