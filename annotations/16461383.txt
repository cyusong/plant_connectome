['16461383', 'Although auxin response factors (ARFs) are the first well-characterized proteins  that bind to the auxin response elements, elucidation of the roles of each ARF  gene in auxin responses and plant development has been challenging. Here we show  that ARF19 and ARF7 not only participate in auxin signaling, but also play a  critical role in ethylene responses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots,  indicating that the ARFs serve as a cross talk point between the two hormones.  Both arf19 and arf7 mutants isolated from our forward genetic screens are auxin  resistant and the arf19arf7 double mutant had stronger auxin resistance than the  single mutants and displayed phenotypes not seen in the single mutants.  Furthermore, we show that a genomic fragment of ARF19 not only complements arf19,  but also rescues arf7. We conclude that ARF19 complements ARF7 at the protein  level and that the ARF7 target sequences are also recognized by ARF19. Therefore,  it is the differences in expression level/pattern and not the differences in  protein sequences between the two ARFs that determines the relative contribution  of the two ARFs in auxin signaling and plant development. In addition to being  auxin resistant, arf19 has also ethylene-insensitive roots and ARF19 expression  is induced by ethylene treatment. This work provides a sensitive genetic screen  for uncovering auxin-resistant mutants including the described arf mutants. This  study also provides a likely mechanism for coordination and integration of  hormonal signals to regulate plant growth and development.', '2006 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.070987', 'Zhao']
