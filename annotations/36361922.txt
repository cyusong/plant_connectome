AtDjC5 belongs to the J-protein family in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Its biological functions remain unclear. In this study, we examined the roles of AtDjC5 in resisting heat stress using reverse genetic analysis. After the seedlings were exposed directly to 44 °C for 90 min, <i>AtDjC5</i> knockout seedlings displayed decreases in the survival rate, membrane system stability, and cell vitality compared to WT seedlings, indicating that AtDjC5 is involved in plant basal thermotolerance. The <i>AtDjC5</i> knockout seedlings pre-exposed to 37 °C for 30 min exhibited decreases in the survival rate and total chlorophyll contents and increased cell death when they were subsequently exposed to 45 °C compared to the WT seedlings, indicating that AtDjC5 plays an important role in plant acquired thermotolerance. AtDjC5 was found to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum. The expression of the <i>AtDjC5</i> gene was induced by heat and TM (an ER stress inducer) treatment. Furthermore, we found that the knockout of <i>AtDjC5</i> inhibited ER stress-induced autophagy and the expression of ER stress-related genes. Taken together, these results suggest that AtDjC5 facilitates thermotolerance, likely by aiding in the ER stress response.
