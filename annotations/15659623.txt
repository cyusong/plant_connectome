['15659623', 'Substantial evidence indicates that amino acid conjugates of indole-3-acetic acid  (IAA) function in auxin homeostasis, yet the plant enzymes involved in their  biosynthesis have not been identified. We tested whether several Arabidopsis  thaliana enzymes that are related to the auxin-induced soybean (Glycine max) GH3  gene product synthesize IAA-amino acid conjugates. In vitro reactions with six  recombinant GH3 enzymes produced IAA conjugates with several amino acids, based  on thin layer chromatography. The identity of the Ala, Asp, Phe, and Trp  conjugates was verified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Insertional  mutations in GH3.1, GH3.2, GH3.5, and GH3.17 resulted in modestly increased  sensitivity to IAA in seedling root. Overexpression of GH3.6 in the  activation-tagged mutant dfl1-D did not significantly alter IAA level but  resulted in 3.2- and 4.5-fold more IAA-Asp than in wild-type seedlings and mature  leaves, respectively. In addition to IAA, dfl1-D was less sensitive to  indole-3-butyric acid and naphthaleneacetic acid, consistent with the fact that  GH3.6 was active on each of these auxins. By contrast, GH3.6 and the other five  enzymes tested were inactive on halogenated auxins, and dfl1-D was not resistant  to these. This evidence establishes that several GH3 genes encode IAA-amido  synthetases, which help to maintain auxin homeostasis by conjugating excess IAA  to amino acids.', '2005 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.026690', 'Suza']
