['22150830', '* The conserved family of Aurora kinases has multiple functions during mitosis.  The roles of plant Aurora kinases have been characterized using inhibitor  treatments. * We down-regulated Aurora kinases in Arabidopsis thaliana using RNA  interference (RNAi). We carried out a detailed phenotypic analysis of Aurora RNAi  plants, biochemical and microscopic studies of AtAurora1 kinase together with  AtTPX2 (targeting protein for Xklp2) and gamma-tubulin. * Cell division defects were  observed in plants with reduced expression of Aurora kinases. Furthermore, the  maintenance of primary meristems was compromised and RNAi seedlings entered  endoreduplication prematurely. AtAurora1, its activator AtTPX2, and gamma-tubulin  were associated with microtubules in vitro; they were attached to regrowing  kinetochore microtubules and colocalized on spindle microtubules and with a  subset of early phragmoplast microtubules. Only the AtAurora1 kinase was  translocated to the area of the cell plate. * RNAi silencing of Aurora kinases  showed that, in addition to their function in regulating mitosis, the kinases are  required for maintaining meristematic activity and controlling the switch from  meristematic cell proliferation to differentiation and endoreduplication. The  colocalization and co-fractionation of AtAurora1 with AtTPX2, and gamma-tubulin on  microtubules in a cell cycle-specific manner suggests that AtAurora1 kinase may  function to phosphorylate substrates that are critical to the spatiotemporal  regulation of acentrosomal microtubule formation and organization.', '2012 Feb', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03989.x', 'Binarova']
