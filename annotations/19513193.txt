Plants rely on the innate immune system to defend themselves from pathogen attacks. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) play key roles in the activation of disease resistance mechanisms in plants. The evolutionarily conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are universal signal transduction modules in eukaryotes and have been implicated in the plant innate immunity. There have been many disputations about the relationship between the radicals (ROS and NO) and MAPK cascades. Recently, we found that MAPK cascades participate in the regulation of the radical burst. Here, we discuss the regulatory mechanisms of the oxidative and NO bursts in response to pathogen attacks, and crosstalk between MAPK signaling and the radical burst.

ROS: !activates! MAPK cascades
NO: !activates! MAPK cascades
MAPK cascades: !regulate! radical burst
Pathogen attack: !triggers! ROS burst
Pathogen attack: !triggers! NO burst
