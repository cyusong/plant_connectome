Plants have many, highly variable resistance (<i>R</i>) gene loci, which provide resistance to a variety of pathogens. The first <i>R</i> gene to be cloned, maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Hm1</i>, was published over 25 years ago, and since then, many different <i>R</i> genes have been identified and isolated. The encoded proteins have provided clues to the diverse molecular mechanisms underlying immunity. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 314 cloned <i>R</i> genes. The majority of <i>R</i> genes encode cell surface or intracellular receptors, and we distinguish nine molecular mechanisms by which R proteins can elevate or trigger disease resistance: direct (1) or indirect (2) perception of pathogen-derived molecules on the cell surface by receptor-like proteins and receptor-like kinases; direct (3) or indirect (4) intracellular detection of pathogen-derived molecules by nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors, or detection through integrated domains (5); perception of transcription activator-like effectors through activation of executor genes (6); and active (7), passive (8), or host reprogramming-mediated (9) loss of susceptibility. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of <i>R</i> genes are only understood for a small proportion of known <i>R</i> genes, a clearer understanding of mechanisms is emerging and will be crucial for rational engineering and deployment of novel <i>R</i> genes.
