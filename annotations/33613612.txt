Vernalization is the promotion of flowering after prolonged exposure to cold. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, vernalization induces epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). The repressive epigenetic mark trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 proteins (H3K27me3) is a critical contributor to the epigenetic silencing of <i>FLC</i>. Interestingly, the deposited H3K27me3 in the <i>FLC</i> locus can be erased by short-term high-temperature treatment. This is referred to as devernalization. In this study, we identified a novel chemical compound, 4-Isoxazolecarboxylic acid, 3,5-dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-isoxazole carboxylic acid 1-methyl-2-oxoethyl ester named as DEVERNALIZER01 (DVR01), which induces devernalization in <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings, by an <i>FLC</i>-luciferase reporter-based high-throughput screening assay. DVR01 decreased the amount of H3K27me3 in the <i>FLC</i> locus in vernalized plants, resulting in the upregulation of <i>FLC</i> in the whole plant, including the vasculature and meristem, where FLC represses floral induction genes. We also showed that a 2-week treatment with DVR01 reverted plants with a vernalized status back to a fully non-vernalized status. Collectively, this study provides a novel structure of DVR01, which modulates devernalization via demethylation of H3K27me3 in the <i>FLC</i> locus.
