Marine diatoms are one of the most ecologically significant primary producers in the ocean. Most diatoms use a CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) to overcome the scarcity of CO2 in the ocean and limitations of the carbon-fixing enzyme Rubisco. However, the CCMs in model diatoms differ substantially in their genetic make-up and structural organization. To assess the extent of CCM diversity in marine diatoms more generally, we analyzed genome and transcriptome data from 31 diatom strains to identify putative CCM genes, examine the overall CCM architecture, and study CCM development in the context of the evolutionary history of these diatoms. Key CCM genes [carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and solute carrier 4 (SLC4) bicarbonate transporters] identified in the diatoms were placed into groups of likely orthologs by sequence similarity (OrthoMCL) and phylogenetic methods. These analyses indicated that diatoms seem to share similar HCO3- transporters, but possess a variety of CAs that have either undergone extensive diversification within the diatom lineage or have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Hierarchical clustering of the diatom species based on their CCM gene content suggests that CCM development is largely congruent with evolution of diatom species, despite some notable differences in CCM genes even among closely related species.
