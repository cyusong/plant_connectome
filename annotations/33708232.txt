<i>Acca sellowiana</i>, known as feijoa or pineapple guava, is a diploid, (2<i>n</i> = 2<i>x</i> = 22) outcrossing fruit tree species native to Uruguay and Brazil. The species stands out for its highly aromatic fruits, with nutraceutical and therapeutic value. Despite its promising agronomical value, genetic studies on this species are limited. Linkage genetic maps are valuable tools for genetic and genomic studies, and constitute essential tools in breeding programs to support the development of molecular breeding strategies. A high-density composite genetic linkage map of <i>A. sellowiana</i> was constructed using two genetically connected populations: H5 (TCO × BR, <i>N</i> = 160) and H6 (TCO × DP, <i>N</i> = 184). Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach was successfully applied for developing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A total of 4,921 SNP markers were identified using the reference genome of the closely related species <i>Eucalyptus grandis</i>, whereas other 4,656 SNPs were discovered using a <i>de novo</i> pipeline. The individual H5 and H6 maps comprised 1,236 and 1,302 markers distributed over the expected 11 linkage groups, respectively. These two maps spanned a map length of 1,593 and 1,572 cM, with an average inter-marker distance of 1.29 and 1.21 cM, respectively. A large proportion of markers were common to both maps and showed a high degree of collinearity. The composite map consisted of 1,897 SNPs markers with a total map length of 1,314 cM and an average inter-marker distance of 0.69. A novel approach for the construction of composite maps where the meiosis information of individuals of two connected populations is captured in a single estimator is described. A high-density, accurate composite map based on a consensus ordering of markers provides a valuable contribution for future genetic research and breeding efforts in <i>A. sellowiana</i>. A novel mapping approach based on an estimation of multipopulation recombination fraction described here may be applied in the construction of dense composite genetic maps for any other outcrossing diploid species.
