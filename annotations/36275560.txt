Auxin plays an essential role in flowering, embryonic development, seed dormancy, and germination. Auxin response factors (ARFs) are plant-specific key transcriptional factors in mediating the gene expression network of auxin signaling. Although ARFs in model plants such as <i>Arabidopsis</i> had been well characterized, their identities and potential roles in non-model plants are less studied. Here, we performed genome-wide identification of ARFs in <i>Magnolia sieboldii</i> K. Koch, a primitive species with high taxonomic importance and medicinal values. We found 25 ARF genes in <i>M. sieboldii</i>, which were widely distributed across multiple chromosomes. Based on sequence similarity, the encoded proteins could be either transcriptional repressors or activators. Gene expression analysis showed a dynamic pattern for many ARFs including <i>MsARF5</i> during seed germination. In addition, overexpressing of <i>MsARF5</i> showed that it restores many developmental defects in the <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutant. Moreover, two phenotypically distinct transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines were obtained, indicating a link between gene expression levels and developmental phenotypes. Taken together, we provided a systematic investigation of the <i>ARF</i> gene family in <i>M. sieboldii</i> and revealed an important role of <i>MsARF5</i> in mediating auxin signaling.
