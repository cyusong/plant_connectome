Membranes are essential for cells and organelles to function. As membranes are impermeable to most polar and charged molecules, they provide electrochemical energy to transport molecules across and create compartmentalized microenvironments for specific enzymatic and cellular processes. Membranes are also responsible for guided transport of cargoes between organelles and during endo- and exocytosis. In addition, membranes play key roles in cell signaling by hosting receptors and signal transducers and as substrates and products of lipid second messengers. Anionic lipids and their specific interaction with target proteins play an essential role in these processes, which are facilitated by specific lipid-binding domains. Protein crystallography, lipid-binding studies, subcellular localization analyses, and computer modeling have greatly advanced our knowledge over the years of how these domains achieve precision binding and what their function is in signaling and membrane trafficking, as well as in plant development and stress acclimation.
