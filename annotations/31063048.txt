Fusarium wilt of banana is caused by the soilborne fungal pathogen <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i>. We generated two chromosome-level assemblies of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> race 1 and tropical race 4 strains using single-molecule real-time sequencing. The <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> race 1 and tropical race 4 assemblies had 35 and 29 contigs with contig N50 lengths of 2.08 and 4.28 Mb, respectively. These two new references genomes represent a greater than 100-fold improvement over the contig N50 statistics of the previous short-read-based <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> assemblies. The two high-quality assemblies reported here will be a valuable resource for the comparative analysis of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> races at the pathogenic level.
