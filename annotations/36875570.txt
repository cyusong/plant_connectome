Long-lived tree species need to cope with changing environments and pathogens during their lifetime. Fungal diseases cause damage to trees growth and forest nurseries. As model system for woody plants, poplars are also hosts of a large variety of fungus. The defense strategies to fungus are generally associated with the type of fungus, therefore, the defense strategies of poplar against necrotrophic and biotrophic fungus are different. Poplars initiate constitutive defenses and induced defenses based on recognition of the fungus, hormone signaling network cascades, activation of defense-related genes and transcription factors and production of phytochemicals. The means of sensing fungus invasion in poplars are similar with herbs, both of which are mediated by receptor proteins and resistance (R) proteins, leading to pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI), but poplars have evolved some unique defense mechanisms compared with <i>Arabidopsis</i> due to their longevity. In this paper, current researches on poplar defensive responses to necrotrophic and biotrophic fungus, which mainly include the physiological and genetic aspects, and the role of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) in fungal resistance are reviewed. This review also provides strategies to enhance poplar disease resistance and some new insights into future research directions.
