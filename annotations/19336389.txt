Growth inhibition in acid soils due to Al stress affects crop production worldwide. To understand mechanisms in sensitive crops that are affected by Al stress, a proteomic analysis of primary tomato root tissue, grown in Al-amended and non-amended liquid cultures, was performed. DIGE-SDS-MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis of these tissues resulted in the identification of 49 proteins that were differentially accumulated. Dehydroascorbate reductase, glutathione reductase, and catalase enzymes associated with antioxidant activities were induced in Al-treated roots. Induced enzyme proteins associated with detoxification were mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, catechol oxidase, quinone reductase, and lactoylglutathione lyase. The germin-like (oxalate oxidase) proteins, the malate dehydrogenase, wali7 and heavy-metal associated domain-containing proteins were suppressed. VHA-ATP that encodes for the catalytic subunit A of the vacuolar ATP synthase was induced and two ATPase subunit 1 isoforms were suppressed. Several proteins in the active methyl cycle, including SAMS, quercetin 3-O-methyltransferase and AdoHcyase, were induced by Al stress. Other induced proteins were isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase and the GDSL-motif lipase hydrolase family protein. NADPH-dependent flavin reductase and beta-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase were suppressed.
