Leaf morphology can affect the development and yield of plants by regulating plant architecture and photosynthesis. Several factors can determine the final leaf morphology, including the leaf complexity, size, shape, and margin type, which suggests that leaf morphogenesis is a complex regulation network. The formation of diverse leaf morphology is precisely controlled by gene regulation on translation and transcription levels. To further reveal this, more and more genome data has been published for different kinds of vegetable crops and advanced genotyping approaches have also been applied to identify the causal genes for the target traits. Therefore, the studies on the molecular regulation of leaf morphogenesis in vegetable crops have also been largely improved. This review will summarize the progress on identified genes or regulatory mechanisms of leaf morphogenesis and development in vegetable crops. These identified markers can be applied for further molecular-assisted selection (MAS) in vegetable crops. Overall, the review will contribute to understanding the leaf morphology of different crops from the perspective of molecular regulation and shortening the breeding cycle for vegetable crops.
