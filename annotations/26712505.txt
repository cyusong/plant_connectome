Receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) are a large group of transmembrane proteins playing critical roles in cell-cell and cell-environment communications. Based on extracellular domain structures, RLKs were classified into more than 21 subfamilies, among which leucine-rich repeat RLKs (LRR-RLKs) belong to the largest subfamily in plants such as Arabidopsis and rice. In Arabidopsis, there are approximately 223 LRR-RLKs, but only about 60 of which have been functionally described to date. To systematically investigate the roles of LRR-RLKs in regulating plant growth, development, and stress adaptations, we generated promoter::GUS transgenic plants for all 223 LRR-RLK genes in Arabidopsis and analyzed their detailed expression patterns at various developmental stages. The results provide valuable resources for functionally elucidating this large and essential signaling protein subfamily.
