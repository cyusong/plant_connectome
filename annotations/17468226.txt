In this study, we investigate the structure of the mitochondrial F(0)F(1)-ATP synthase of the colorless alga Polytomella sp. with respect to the enzyme of its green close relative Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. It is demonstrated that several unique features of the ATP synthase in C. reinhardtii are also present in Polytomella sp. The alpha- and beta-subunits of the ATP synthase from both algae are highly unusual in that they exhibit extensions at their N- and C-terminal ends, respectively. Several subunits of the Polytomella ATP synthase in the range of 9 to 66 kD have homologs in the green alga but do not have known equivalents as yet in mitochondrial ATP synthases of mammals, plants, or fungi. The largest of these so-called ASA (ATP Synthase-Associated) subunits, ASA1, is shown to be an extrinsic protein. Short heat treatment of isolated Polytomella mitochondria unexpectedly dissociated the otherwise highly stable ATP synthase dimer of 1,600 kD into subcomplexes of 800 and 400 kD, assigned as the ATP synthase monomer and F(1)-ATPase, respectively. Whereas no ASA subunits were found in the F(1)-ATPase, all but two were present in the monomer. ASA6 (12 kD) and ASA9 (9 kD), predicted to be membrane bound, were not detected in the monomer and are thus proposed to be involved in the formation or stabilization of the enzyme. A hypothetical configuration of the Chlamydomonad dimeric ATP synthase portraying its unique features is provided to spur further research on this topic.
