Crocin is an apocarotenoid glycosyl ester accumulating in fruits of Gardenia jasminoides and used as a food coloring and nutraceutical. For the first time, the two glucosyltransferases UGT75L6 and UGT94E5 that sequentially mediate the final glucosylation steps in crocin biosynthesis in G. jasminoides have been identified and functionally characterized. UGT75L6 preferentially glucosylates the carboxyl group of crocetin yielding crocetin glucosyl esters, while UGT94E5 glucosylates the 6' hydroxyl group of the glucose moiety of crocetin glucosyl esters. The expression pattern of neither UGT75L6 nor UGT94E5 correlated with the pattern of crocin accumulation in G. jasminoides.

UGT75L6: !glucosylates! crocetin 
UGT94E5: !glucosylates! glucose moiety of crocetin glucosyl esters 
UGT75L6: !preferentially glucosylates! carboxyl group of crocetin 
UGT94E5: !glucosylates! 6' hydroxyl group of glucose moiety of crocetin glucosyl esters 
UGT75L6: !expression pattern not correlated with! crocin accumulation 
UGT94E5: !expression pattern not correlated with! crocin accumulation
