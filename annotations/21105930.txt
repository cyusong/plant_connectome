['21105930', "Cellular patterning and differentiation in plants depend on the balance of  asymmetric and symmetric divisions. Patterning of the male gametophyte (pollen  grains) in flowering plants requires asymmetric division of the microspore  followed by a symmetric division of the germ cell to produce three highly  differentiated cells: a single vegetative cell and two sperm cells. In  Arabidopsis sidecar pollen (scp) mutants a proportion of microspores first divide  symmetrically, and then go on to produce 'four-celled' pollen with an extra  vegetative cell; however, details of the timing and origin of phenotypic defects  in scp and the identity of the SCP gene have remained obscure. Comparative  analysis of the original hypomorphic scp-1 allele and a T-DNA-induced null  allele, scp-2, revealed that in the absence of SCP, microspores undergo normal  nuclear positioning, but show delayed entry into mitosis, increased cell  expansion and alterations in the orientation of nuclear division. We identified  the SCP gene to encode a male gametophyte-specific LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES  DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2-like (LBD/ASL) protein that is expressed in microspore  nuclei in a tightly regulated phase-specific manner. Therefore, our study  demonstrates that the correct patterning of male gametophyte depends on the  activity of a nuclear LBD/ASL family protein that is essential for the correct  timing and orientation of asymmetric microspore division.", '2010 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04374.x', 'Park']
