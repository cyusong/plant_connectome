Extensive utilization of silver nanoparticles (NPs) in agricultural products results in their interaction with other chemicals in the environment. To study the combined effects of silver NPs with nicotinic acid and potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>), a gel-free/label-free proteomic technique was used. Root length/weight and hypocotyl length/weight of soybean were enhanced by silver NPs mixed with nicotinic acid and KNO<sub>3</sub>. Out of a total 6340 identified proteins, 351 proteins were significantly changed, out of which 247 and 104 proteins increased and decreased, respectively. Differentially changed proteins were predominantly associated with protein degradation and synthesis according to the functional categorization. Protein-degradation-related proteins mainly consisted of the proteasome degradation pathway. The cell death was significantly higher in the root tips of soybean under the combined treatment compared to flooding stress. Accumulation of calnexin/calreticulin and glycoproteins was significantly increased under flooding with silver NPs, nicotinic acid, and KNO<sub>3</sub>. Growth of soybean seedlings with silver NPs, nicotinic acid, and KNO<sub>3</sub> was improved under flooding stress. These results suggest that the combined mixture of silver NPs, nicotinic acid, and KNO<sub>3</sub> causes positive effects on soybean seedling by regulating the protein quality control for the mis-folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, it might improve the growth of soybean under flooding stress.
