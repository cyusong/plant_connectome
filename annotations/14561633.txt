['14561633', 'Previously characterized Arabidopsis gl3 mutants have trichomes that are smaller,  less branched and undergo fewer rounds of endoreplication than wild-type  trichomes. A new gl3 mutant, called gl3-sst, has oddly shaped trichomes that over  expand during early development, undergo more endoreduplication and that have a  striking nuclear morphology. The mutant nuclei consist of many interconnected  lobes; however, only a single set of polytene-like chromosomes reside in the  mutant nuclei. The predicted gl3-sst polypeptide has a Leu to Phe substitution  (codon 78) within a region responsible for protein-protein interaction. Yeast  interaction assays comparing GL3 with gl3-sst proteins show that the mutant  protein interaction with GL1 and TTG1 is decreased by 75% and 50%, respectively,  but there is no difference in its interaction with TRY. Furthermore, TRY has the  ability to prevent the GL1 GL3 interaction and the GL1 gl3-sst interaction is  even more sensitive to TRY. Analysis of plants expressing functional GFP-tagged  versions of GL1, GL3 and TRY show that the proteins are localized in trichome  nuclei. These results have been used to model trichome initiation in terms of  protein interactions and threshold levels of activator complex.', '2003 Dec', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.00812', 'Marks']
