Ion homeostasis is essential for plant cell resistance to salt stress. Under salt stress, to avoid cellular damage and nutrient deficiency, plant cells need to maintain adequate K nutrition and a favorable K to Na ratio in the cytosol. Recent observations revealed that both nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) act as signaling molecules to regulate K to Na ratio in calluses from Populus euphratica under salt stress. Evidence indicated that NO mediating H(2)O(2) causes salt resistance via the action of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase but that activity of plasma membrane NADPH oxidase is dependent on NO. Our study demonstrated the signaling transduction pathway. In this addendum, we proposed a testable hypothesis for NO function in regulation of H(2)O(2) mediating salt resistance.

NO: !mediates! H(2)O(2)
H(2)O(2): !regulates! K to Na ratio
NO: !activates! plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase
NO: !depends on! plasma membrane NADPH oxidase
