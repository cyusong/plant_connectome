Few atypical aspartic proteases (APs) present in plants have been functionally studied to date despite having been implicated in developmental processes and stress responses. Here we characterize a novel atypical AP that we name Atypical Aspartic Protease in Roots 1 (ASPR1), denoting its expression in Arabidopsis roots. Recombinant ASPR1 produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana was active and displayed atypical properties, combining optimum acidic pH, partial sensitivity to pepstatin, pronounced sensitivity to redox agents, and unique specificity preferences resembling those of fungal APs. ASPR1 overexpression suppressed primary root growth and lateral root development, implying a previously unknown biological role for an AP. Quantitative comparison of wild-type and aspr1 root proteomes revealed deregulation of proteins associated with both reactive oxygen species and auxin homeostasis in the mutant. Together, our findings on ASPR1 reinforce the diverse pattern of enzymatic properties and biological roles of atypical APs and raise exciting questions on how these distinctive features impact functional specialization among these proteases.
