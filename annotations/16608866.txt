['16608866', 'The mechanistic role of a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein designated atRZ-1a  that contributes to enhance cold tolerance in Arabidopsis was investigated.  Overexpression of atRZ-1a did not affect the expression of various  cold-responsive genes such as COR6.6, COR15a, COR47, RD29A, RD29B and LTI29.  Proteome analyses revealed that overexpression of atRZ-1a modulated the  expression of several stress-responsive genes, and the transcript levels and RNA  stability of these target genes were not affected by atRZ-1a. atRZ-1a  successfully complements the cold sensitivity of Escherichia coli lacking four  cold shock proteins. These results strongly suggest that atRZ-1a plays a role as  an RNA chaperone during the cold adaptation process.', '2006 Jun', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcj047', 'Kang']
