The gaseous phytohormone ethylene mediates numerous aspects of plant growth and development as well as stress responses. The F-box proteins EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 (EBF1) and EBF2 are key components that ubiquitinate and degrade the master transcription factors ethylene insensitive 3 (EIN3) and EIN3-like 1 (EIL1) in the ethylene response pathway. Notably, EBF1 and EBF2 themselves undergo the 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis induced by ethylene and other stress signals. However, despite their importance, little is known about the mechanisms regulating the degradation of these proteins. Here, we show that a really interesting new gene (RING)-type E3 ligase, salt- and drought-induced ring finger 1 (SDIR1), positively regulates the ethylene response and promotes the accumulation of EIN3. Further analyses indicate that SDIR1 directly interacts with EBF1/EBF2 and targets them for ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. We show that SDIR1 is required for the fine tuning of the ethylene response to ambient temperature changes by mediating temperature-induced EBF1/EBF2 degradation and EIN3 accumulation. Thus, our work demonstrates that SDIR1 functions as an important modulator of ethylene signaling in response to ambient temperature changes, thereby enabling plant adaptation under fluctuating environmental conditions.
