Geminiviruses (family <i>Geminiviridae</i>) are among the most devastating plant viruses worldwide, causing severe damage in crops of economic and subsistence importance. These viruses have very compact genomes and many of the encoded proteins are multifunctional. Here, we investigated the role of the East African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus (EACMCV) AC4 on virus infectivity in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Results showed that plants inoculated with EACMCV containing a knockout mutation in an AC4 open reading frame displayed symptoms 2 to 3 days later than plants inoculated with wild-type virus, and these plants recovered from infection, whereas plants inoculated with the wild-type virus did not. Curiously, when an additional mutation was made in the knockout mutant, the resulting double mutant virus completely failed to cause any apparent symptoms. Interestingly, the role of AC4 on virus infectivity appeared to be dependent on an encoded <i>N</i>-myristoylation motif that mediates cell membrane binding. We previously showed that EACMCV containing the AC4<sup>T38I</sup> mutant produced virus progeny characterized by second-site mutations and reversion to wild-type virus. These results were confirmed in this study using additional mutations. Together, these results show involvement of EACMCV AC4 in virus infectivity; they also suggest a role for the combined action of mutation and selection, under prevailing environmental conditions, on begomovirus genetic variation and diversity.
