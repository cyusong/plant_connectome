Exposure of roots to low Cd concentration induced morphogenic responses including the inhibition of root growth and the radial swelling of root tip. High Cd concentrations within a few minutes caused a robust induction of superoxide generation leading to the cell death and root growth arrest. This toxic superoxide generation blocked the development of low Cd concentration-activated morphogenic responses. While the morphogenic responses of roots to low Cd concentration are induced very rapidly and probably due to the interaction of Cd with the apoplast of root tissue, high Cd concentration-induced superoxide production required the entry of Cd into the symplast. Auxin signaling is involved in the activation of Cd-induced morphogenic defence responses but not in the Cd-induced toxic superoxide generation. These results suggest that oxidative stress is not a primary cause for the Cd-induced morphogenic responses such as growth reduction and radial cell expansion in barley root tips.
