['11272725', 'Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (FPG) catalyzes the initial steps in the  repair of DNA containing oxidized purines. Two complementary DNA clones encoding  homologs of bacterial FPG, designated Atfpg-1 and Atfpg-2, have been isolated  from Arabidopsis thaliana. They are products of alternative splicing of the  transcript of a single gene. Proteins encoded by both clones, AtFPG-1 and  AtFPG-2, engineered to contain oligohistidine sequences on their C-terminal ends,  were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, and their activities were  assayed. Both proteins cleaved DNA that contained apurinic sites, indicating that  they have abasic lyase activity. AtFPG-1, but not AtFPG-2, showed significant  cleavage of a double-stranded oligonucleotide that contained 8-oxo-guanine,  indicating that the structural differences between the two proteins influence  their enzymatic activities. However, both proteins were able to cleave the same  sites in DNA that was treated with visible light in the presence of methylene  blue.', '2001 Feb', 'Photochem Photobiol', '10.1562/0031-8655(2001)073<0128:afofdg>2.0.co;2', 'Murphy']
