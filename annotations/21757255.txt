We previously reported that native tropical zone plants showed high acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity during heat stress, and that AChE activity in endodermal cells of maize seedlings was increased by heat treatment. However, the physiological role of AChE in heat stressed plants is still unclear. Here we report (1) tissue-specific expression and subcellular localization of maize AChE, (2) elevation of AChE activity and possible post-translational modifications of this enzyme under heat stress, and (3) involvement of AChE in plant heat stress tolerance. Maize AChE was mainly expressed in coleoptile nodes and seeds. Maize AChE fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was localized in extracellular spaces of transgenic rice plants. Therefore, in maize coleoptile nodes and seeds AChE mainly functions in the cell wall matrix. After heat treatment, enhanced maize AChE activity was observed by in vitro activity measurement and by in situ cytochemical staining; transcript and protein levels, however, were not changed. Protein gel blot analysis revealed two AChE isoforms (upper and lower); the upper-form gradually disappeared after heat treatment. Thus, maize AChE activity might be enhanced through a post-translational modification response to heat stress. Finally, we found that overexpression of maize AChE in transgenic tobacco plants enhanced heat tolerance relative to that of non-transgenic plants, suggesting AChE plays a positive role in maize heat tolerance.
