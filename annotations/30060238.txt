Plant cell biofactories represent a promising solution to the increasing demand for plant-derived compounds, but there are still limiting factors that prevent optimal production, including the loss of yield during in vitro maintenance. Our results reveal a clear correlation between genomic methylation levels and a progressive decline in taxane production in Taxus spp. cell cultures. A comparative study of two cell lines, one 10 years old and low productive and the other new and high productive, revealed important differences in appearance, growth, taxane accumulation and expression levels of several taxane biosynthetic genes. Differences in taxane content and gene expression profile indicate an altered pathway regulation and that the BAPT gene, located in the center of the expression network of taxane biosynthetic genes, is active in a potentially flux-limiting step. The methylation patterns of the BAPT gene were studied in both cell lines by bisulfite sequencing, which revealed high rates of CHH methylated cytosines on the core promoter. Using a bioinformatics approach, this hotspot was identified as a Y-patch promoter element. The Y-patch may play a key role in the epigenetic regulation of the taxane biosynthetic pathway, which would open up novel genetic engineering strategies toward stable and high productivity.
