Plant peptide signaling is an upcoming topic in many areas of plant research. Our recent findings show that the tyrosine sulfated peptide receptors PSKR1 and PSY1R are not only involved in growth and development but also in plant defense. They modulate salicylate- and jasmonate-dependent defense pathways in an antagonistic manner and this phenomenon might be dependent on the age and developmental stage of the plant. Here we discuss how the endogenous peptides might integrate growth, wounding, senescence and the opposing defense pathways against biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens for increased fitness of the plant.

PSKR1: !modulates! salicylate- and jasmonate-dependent defense pathways
PSY1R: !modulates! salicylate- and jasmonate-dependent defense pathways
peptides: !integrate! growth, wounding, senescence and defense pathways
plant: !increases fitness! through peptide signaling
