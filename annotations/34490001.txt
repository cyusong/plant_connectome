Fructose-1,6-biphosphate aldolase (FBA) is a multifunctional enzyme in plants, which participates in the process of Calvin-Benson cycle, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Despite the importance of <i>FBA</i> genes in regulating plant growth, development and abiotic stress responses, little is known about their roles in cotton. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide identification and characterization of <i>FBAs</i> in <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>. Totally seventeen <i>GhFBA</i> genes were identified. According to the analysis of functional domain, phylogenetic relationship, and gene structure, <i>GhFBA</i> genes were classified into two subgroups. Furthermore, nine <i>GhFBAs</i> were predicted to be in chloroplast and eight were located in cytoplasm. Moreover, the promoter prediction showed a variety of abiotic stresses and phytohormone related <i>cis</i>-acting elements exist in the 2k up-stream region of <i>GhFBA</i>. And the evolutionary characteristics of cotton <i>FBA</i> genes were clearly presented by synteny analysis. Moreover, the results of transcriptome and qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of <i>GhFBAs</i> were related to the tissue distribution, and further analysis suggested that <i>GhFBAs</i> could respond to various abiotic stress and phytohormonal treatments. Overall, our systematic analysis of <i>GhFBA</i> genes would not only provide a basis for the understanding of the evolution of <i>GhFBAs</i>, but also found a foundation for the further function analysis of <i>GhFBAs</i> to improve cotton yield and environmental adaptability.
