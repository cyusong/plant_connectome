['17956860', 'Methionine residues of proteins are a major target for oxidation by reactive  oxygen species (ROS), which are generated in response to a variety of stress  conditions. Methionine sulfoxide (MetO) reductases are present in most organisms  and play protective roles in the cellular response to oxidative stress, reducing  oxidized MetO back to Met. Previously, an Arabidopsis MetO reductase, MsrB3, was  identified as a cold-responsive protein. Here we report that MsrB3 functions in  the process of cold acclimation, thus contributing to cold tolerance. In contrast  to normal, wild-type plants, msrb3 mutant plants lost the ability to become  tolerant to freezing temperatures following cold pre-treatment. Furthermore, when  exposed to low temperature, msrb3 plants exhibited a larger increase in MetO and  H(2)O(2) content and electrolyte leakage compared with wild-type and MsrB3  transgenic plants. It is also shown that MsrB3 is localized at the endoplasmic  reticulum (ER). We propose that MsrB3 plays an important role in cold tolerance  by eliminating MetO and ROS that accumulate at the ER during cold acclimation.', '2007 Dec', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcm143', 'Park']
