Boron (B) is an essential micronutrient for vascular plants. Boron plays a structural role in cell walls through binding to pectic polysaccharides. It still remains unclear how B deficiency, and hence probably alterations in cell wall structure, leads to various metabolic disorders and cell death. To understand the process, we analyzed the physiological changes in suspension- cultured tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 cells under B deficiency. The results indicated that the cells deprived of B did not undergo a typical programmed cell death process. Oxidative damage was proven to be the direct and major cause of cell death. We discuss possible mechanisms for the generation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species under B deprivation.
