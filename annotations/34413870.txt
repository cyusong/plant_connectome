Auxin, an important plant hormone, induces the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites by modulating the expression of auxin-responsive genes. In the ornamental plant <i>Hedychium coronarium</i>, linalool and methyl benzoate are biosynthesized by the terpene synthase (TPS) HcTPS5 and the benzoic/salicylic acid methyltransferase (BSMT) HcBSMT2, respectively. However, the transcriptional regulation of this process remains unclear. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the R2R3-MYB transcription factors HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 in regulating the biosynthesis of these floral aroma compounds. <i>HcMYB1</i> and <i>HcMYB2</i> are specifically expressed in flowers, their expression is correlated with the emission of volatile compounds in flowers, and is induced by auxin. Moreover, HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 interact with the <i>HcBSMT2</i> promoter region. HcMYB2 activates the expression of the linalool synthase gene <i>HcTPS5</i>. In flowers with <i>HcMYB1</i> or <i>HcMYB2</i> silenced, the levels of floral scent compounds were significantly reduced, and <i>HcBSMT2</i> and <i>HcTPS5</i> were downregulated compared with the wild type. Moreover, HcMYB1 form protein-protein interaction with key scent-related HcIAA4 protein to regulate floral aroma production. Taken together, these results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 play crucial roles in regulating the formation of scent compounds in <i>Hedychium coronarium (H. coronarium)</i> flowers in response to auxin signaling.
