Tomato is one of the most economically important vegetables worldwide and is constantly threatened by various biotic and abiotic stress factors reducing the quality and quantity in the production of this crop. As an alternative to mitigate stress in plants, carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) have been used in agricultural areas. Therefore, the objective of the present work was to evaluate the antioxidant responses of tomato seedlings to the application via foliar and drench of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene (GP). Different doses (10, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) and a control were evaluated. The results showed that the fresh and dry root weight increased with the application of CNMs. Regarding the antioxidant responses of tomato seedlings, the application of CNMs increased the content of phenols, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, glutathione, photosynthetic pigments, activity of the enzyme's ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase as well as the content of proteins. Therefore, the use of carbon-based nanomaterials could be a good alternative to induce tolerance to different stress in tomato crop.
