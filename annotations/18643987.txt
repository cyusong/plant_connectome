['18643987', 'Ubiquitination plays important roles in plant development, including programmed  cell death. Here, we characterize a novel membrane-bound RING motif protein,  encoded by RING1, that is expressed at a low level in all Arabidopsis tissues but  can be upregulated by fumonisin B1 (FB1) treatment and pathogen infection. RING1  displays E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro, which is dependent on the  integrity of the RING motif. GFP fusion protein localization and cell  fractionation experiments show that this E3 ligase is associated with the lipid  rafts of plasma membranes. Knock-down of RING1 transcripts using artificial  microRNA (amiR-R1(159)) leads to FB1 hyposensitivity, but overexpression of RING1  confers hypersensitivity. Additionally, expression of the pathogenesis-related 1  (PR-1) gene is lower and delayed in amiR-R1(159) plants compared with wild-type  and RING1-overexpressing plants. The FB1 hyposensitivity of amiR-R1(159) plants  can be rescued by expression of cleavage-resistant RING1mut transcripts. Our  results suggest that RING1 acts as a signal from the plasma membrane lipid rafts  to trigger the FB1-induced plant programmed cell death pathway.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03625.x', 'Chua']
