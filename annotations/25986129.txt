['25986129', 'The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) Leu, Ile, and Val are among nine essential  amino acids that must be obtained from the diet of humans and other animals, and  can be nutritionally limiting in plant foods. Despite genetic evidence of its  importance in regulating seed amino acid levels, the full BCAA catabolic network  is not completely understood in plants, and limited information is available  regarding its regulation. In this study, transcript coexpression analyses  revealed positive correlations among BCAA catabolism genes in stress,  development, diurnal/circadian, and light data sets. A core subset of BCAA  catabolism genes, including those encoding putative branched-chain ketoacid  dehydrogenase subunits, is highly expressed during the night in plants on a diel  cycle and in prolonged darkness. Mutants defective in these subunits accumulate  higher levels of BCAAs in mature seeds, providing genetic evidence for their  function in BCAA catabolism. In addition, prolonged dark treatment caused the  mutants to undergo senescence early and overaccumulate leaf BCAAs. These results  extend the previous evidence that BCAAs can be catabolized and serve as  respiratory substrates at multiple steps. Moreover, comparison of amino acid  profiles between mature seeds and dark-treated leaves revealed differences in  amino acid accumulation when BCAA catabolism is perturbed. Together, these  results demonstrate the consequences of blocking BCAA catabolism during both  normal growth conditions and under energy-limited conditions.', '2015 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.00461', 'ORCID:']
