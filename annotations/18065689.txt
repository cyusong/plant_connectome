['18065689', 'The plant hormone cytokinin regulates many aspects of growth and development.  Cytokinin signaling involves His kinase receptors that perceive cytokinin and  transmit the signal via a multistep phosphorelay similar to bacterial  two-component signaling systems. The final targets of this phosphorelay are a set  of Arabidopsis thaliana Response Regulator (ARR) proteins containing a receiver  domain with a conserved Asp phosphorylation site. One class of these, the type-A  ARRs, are negative regulators of cytokinin signaling that are rapidly  transcriptionally upregulated in response to cytokinin. In this study, we tested  the role of phosphorylation in type-A ARR function. Our results indicate that  phosphorylation of the receiver domain is required for type-A ARR function and  suggest that negative regulation of cytokinin signaling by the type-A ARRs most  likely involves phosphorylation-dependent interactions. Furthermore, we show that  a subset of the type-A ARR proteins are stabilized in response to cytokinin in  part via phosphorylation. These studies shed light on the mechanism by which  type-A ARRs act to negatively regulate cytokinin signaling and reveal a novel  mechanism by which cytokinin controls type-A ARR function.', '2007 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.052662', 'Kieber']
