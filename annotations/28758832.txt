Reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as a key signal messenger in plant cells. Plant NADPH oxidases, known as respiratory burst oxidase homologues (RBOHs), catalyze the production of superoxide, a type of ROS, and are involved in several essential processes in plants. In this review, we discuss recent studies about functional regulation of RBOHs by calcineurin B-like protein (CBL)-CIPKs (the CBL-interacting protein kinases), small GTPases, and lipids that integrate developmental cues and external stimuli.

RBOH: !catalyzes! ROS production
CBL-CIPKs: !regulate! RBOH
Small GTPases: !regulate! RBOH
Lipids: !integrate! developmental cues and external stimuli
