Gene activity is largely controlled by transcriptional regulation through the action of transcription factors and other regulators. QsMYB1 is a member of the R2R3-MYB transcription factor family related to secondary growth, and in particular, with the cork development process. In order to identify the putative gene targets of QsMYB1 across the cork oak genome we developed a ChIP-Seq strategy. Results provide direct evidence that QsMY1B targets genes encoding for enzymes involved in the lignin and suberin pathways as well as gene encoding for ABCG transporters and LTPs implicated in the transport of monomeric suberin units across the cellular membrane. These results highlight the role of QsMYB1 as a regulator of lignin and suberin biosynthesis, transport and assembly. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first ChIP-Seq experiment performed in cork oak, a non-model plant species with a long-life cycle, and these results will contribute to deepen the knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of cork formation and differentiation.
