Auxin is a general coordinator for growth and development throughout plant lifespan, acting in a concentration-dependent manner. Tryptophan aminotransferases (YUCCA) family catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) to form indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and plays a critical role in auxin homeostasis. Here, 18 <i>YUCCA</i> family genes divided into four categories were identified from <i>Mikania micrantha</i> (<i>M. micrantha</i>), one of the world's most invasive plants. Five highly conserved motifs were characterized in these <i>YUCCA</i> genes (<i>MmYUCs</i>). Transcriptome analysis revealed that <i>MmYUCs</i> exhibited distinct expression patterns in different organs and five <i>MmYUCs</i> showed high expression levels throughout all the five tissues, implying that they may play dominant roles in auxin biosynthesis and plant development. In addition, <i>MmYUC6_1</i> was overexpressed in <i>DR5::GUS Arabidopsis</i> line to explore its function, which resulted in remarkably increased auxin level and typical elevated auxin-related phenotypes including shortened roots and elongated hypocotyls in the transgenic plants, suggesting that <i>MmYUC6_1</i> promoted IAA biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Collectively, these findings provided comprehensive insight into the phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal distributions, expression patterns and functions of the <i>MmYUC</i> genes in <i>M. micrantha</i>, which would facilitate the study of molecular mechanisms underlying the fast growth of <i>M. micrantha</i> and preventing its invasion.
