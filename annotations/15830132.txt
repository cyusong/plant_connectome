The gene encoding the wild type Integrase protein of coliphage HK022 was integrated chromosomally and expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Double-transgenic plants cloned with the int gene as well as with a T-DNA fragment carrying the proper att sites in a tandem orientation showed that Int catalyzed a site-specific integration reaction (attP x attB) as well as a site-specific excision reaction (attL x attR). The reactions took place without the need to provide any of the accessory proteins that are required by Int in the bacterial host. When expressed in tobacco plants a GFP-Int fusion exhibits a predominant nuclear localization.
