Plants adapt to cold stress at the physiological and biochemical levels, thus enabling them to maintain growth and development. However, the molecular mechanism of fine-tuning cold signals remains largely unknown. We addressed the function of SlSEC1-SlC3H39 module in cold tolerance by using SlSEC1 and SlC3H39 knockout and overexpression tomato lines. A tandem CCCH zinc-finger protein SlC3H39 negatively modulates cold tolerance in tomato. SlC3H39 binds to AU-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) to induce mRNA degradation and regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally. We further validate that SlC3H39 participates in post-transcriptional regulation of a variety of cold-responsive genes. An O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase SlSEC1 physically interacts with SlC3H39 proteins and negatively regulates cold tolerance in tomato. Further study shows that SlSEC1 is essential for SlC3H39 protein stability and maintains SlC3H39 function in cold tolerance. Genetic analysis shows that SlC3H39 is epistatic to SlSEC1 in cold tolerance. The findings indicate that SlC3H39 negatively modulates plant cold tolerance through post-transcriptional regulation by binding to cold-responding mRNA 3'-UTR and reducing those transcripts. SlSEC1 promotes the O-GlcNAclation status of SlC3H39 and maintains SlC3H39 function in cold tolerance. Taken together, we propose a SlSEC1-SlC3H39 module, which allows plants to balance defense responses and growth processes.
