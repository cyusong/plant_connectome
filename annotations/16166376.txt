['16166376', 'Here we examine the function of ATM and ATR at telomeres in Arabidopsis. Although  plants lacking ATM or ATR display wild-type telomere length homeostasis,  chromosome end protection is compromised in atm atr mutants. Moreover, atm tert  Arabidopsis experience an abrupt, early onset of genome instability, arguing that  ATM is required for protection of short telomeres. ATR, by contrast, is required  for maintenance of telomeric DNA as telomere shortening is dramatically  accelerated in atr tert mutants relative to tert plants. Thus, ATM and ATR make  essential and distinct contributions to chromosome end protection and telomere  maintenance in higher eukaryotes.', '2005 Sep 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1333805', 'Shippen']
