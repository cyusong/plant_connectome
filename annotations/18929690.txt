['18929690', 'Histone acetylation is an example of covalent modification of chromatin structure  that has the potential to regulate gene expression. Gcn5 is a prototypical  histone acetyltransferase that associates with the transcriptional coactivator  Ada2. In Arabidopsis, two genes encode proteins that resemble yeast ADA2 and  share approximately 45% amino acid sequence identity. We previously reported that  plants harboring a T-DNA insertion in the ADA2b gene display a dwarf phenotype  with developmental defects in several organs. Here we describe T-DNA insertion  alleles in the ADA2a gene, which result in no dramatic growth or developmental  phenotype. Both ADA2a and ADA2b are expressed in a variety of plant tissues;  moreover, expression of ADA2a from a constitutive promoter fails to complement  the ada2b-1 mutant phenotype, consistent with the hypothesis that the two  proteins have distinct biochemical roles. To further probe the cellular roles of  ADA2a and ADA2b, we studied the response of the transcriptional coactivator  mutants to abiotic stress. Although ada2b seedlings display hypersensitivity to  salt and abscisic acid and altered responses to low temperature stress, the  responses of ada2a seedlings to abiotic stress generally parallel those of  wildtype plants. Intriguingly, ada2a;ada2b double mutant plants display an  intermediate, gcn5-like phenotype, suggesting that ADA2a and ADA2b each work  independently with GCN5 to affect genome function in Arabidopsis.', '2009 Feb', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbagrm.2008.09.003', 'Triezenberg']
