Despite the fact that the precise physiological function of ASRs [abscisic acid (ABA), stress, ripening] remains unknown, they have been suggested to play a dual role in the plant response to environmental cues, as highly hydrophilic proteins for direct protection, as well as transcription factors involved in the regulation of gene expression. To investigate further the biological positioning of grape ASR in the hormonal and metabolic signal network, three promoters corresponding to its cDNA were isolated and submited to a detailed in silico and functional analysis. The results obtained provided evidence for the allelic polymorphism of the grape ASR gene, the organ-preferential expression conferred on the GUS reporter gene, and the specific phloem tissue localization revealed by in situ hybridization. The study of glucose and ABA signalling in its transcriptional control, by transfection of grape protoplasts using the dual luciferase system, revealed the complexity of ASR gene expression regulation. A model was proposed allowing a discussion of the place of ASR in the fine tuning of hormonal and metabolic signalling involved in the integration of environmental cues by the plant organism.
