Flavonoids are secondary metabolites widely found in plants with antioxidants, of which chalcone synthase (CHS) is a key enzyme required in flavonoid synthesis pathways. The objective of this study was to clone a <i>CHS</i> gene from trifoliate orange (<i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>) and analyze its biological information and partial functions. A PtCHS gene (NCBI accession: MZ350874) was cloned from the genome-wide of trifoliate orange, which has 1156 bp in length, encoding 391 amino acids, with a predicted protein relative molecular mass of 42640.19, a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.28, and a lipid coefficient of 89.82. The protein is stable, hydrophilic, and high sequence conservation (92.49% sequence homology with CHS gene of other species). <i>PtCHS</i> was highly expressed in stems, leaves and flowers, but very low expression in roots and seeds. Soil water deficit could up-regulate expressions of <i>PtCHS</i> in leaves. An arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, <i>Funneliformis mosseae</i>, significantly increased plant biomass production, CHS activity, expressions of <i>PtCHS</i>, and total flavonoid content in leaves and roots, independent of soil water status. Total flavonoids were significantly positively correlated with <i>PtCHS</i> expression in leaves only and also positively with root mycorrhizal colonization. Such results provide insight into the important functions of <i>PtCHS</i> in trifoliate orange.
