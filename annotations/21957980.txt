['21957980', 'In anther development, tapetal cells take part in complex processes, including  endomitosis and apoptosis (programmed cell death). The tapetum provides many of  the proteins, lipids, polysaccharides and other molecules necessary for pollen  development. Several transcription factors, including DYT1, TDF1, AMS, MS188 and  MS1, have been reported to be essential for tapetum development and function in  Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we present a detailed cytological analysis of  knockout mutants for these genes, along with an in situ RNA hybridization  experiment and double mutant analysis showing that these transcription factors  form a genetic pathway in tapetum development. DYT1, TDF1 and AMS function in  early tapetum development, while MS188 and MS1 are important for late tapetum  development. The genetic pathway revealed in this work facilitates further  investigation of the function and molecular mechanisms of tapetum development in  Arabidopsis.', '2011 Nov', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/j.1744-7909.2011.01078.x', 'Yang']
