['27592418', 'Plant defensins constitute the innate immune response against pathogens such as  fungi and bacteria. Typical plant defensins are small, basic peptides that  possess a characteristic three-dimensional fold stabilized by three or four  disulfide bridges. In addition to known defensin genes, the Arabidopsis genome  comprises >300 defensin-like genes coding for small cysteine-rich peptides. One  of such genes encodes for AtPDFL2.1, a putative antifungal peptide of 55 amino  acids, with six cysteine residues in its primary sequence. To understand the  functional role of AtPDFL2.1, we carried out antifungal activity assays and  determined its high-resolution three-dimensional structure using multidimensional  solution NMR spectroscopy. We found that AtPDFL2.1 displays a strong inhibitory  effect against Fusarium graminearum (IC(50) approximately 4muM). This peptide folds in the  canonical cysteine-stabilized alphabeta (CSalphabeta) motif, consisting of one alpha-helix and one  triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet stabilized by three disulfide bridges and a  hydrophobic cluster of residues within its core where the alpha-helix packs tightly  against the beta-sheets. Nuclear spin relaxation measurements show that the  structure of AtPDFL2.1 is essentially rigid, with the L3 loop located between  beta-strands 2 and 3 being more flexible and displaying conformational exchange.  Interestingly, the dynamic features of loop L3 are conserved among defensins and  are probably correlated to the antifungal and receptor binding activities.', '2016 Dec', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbapap.2016.08.017', 'Veglia']
