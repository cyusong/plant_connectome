Reproducible and stable transgene expression is an important goal in plant basic research and applications. Hence, we report the first stable expression of bacterial transgenes in medicinal plant, <i>Peperomia pellucida</i> (L.) Kunth. Two key elements relevant to the dynamic expression of the bacterial cytokinin biosynthesis gene, <i>ipt</i> (isopentenyltransferase) were examined. First, by designing a specific expression cassette driven by a tissue-specific promoter for the required levels of gene expression in the particular function of development, and second by using <i>P. pellucida</i> as a model plant due to its short developmental cycle that supported expedient tracking of transgene expression in the progeny. Transgenic frequencies of <i>ipt</i> gene obtained from different expression cassettes of pKNOX1 for tissue-specific promoter in shoot apical meristem were compared with the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV35S) promoter (p35S), a constitutive promoter investigated for T<sub>3</sub> generation. It was clearly shown that transgenic plants with pKNOX1 showed percentage of survivals in T<sub>3</sub> at about 2.2 folds more than those of p35S-transgenic. Transgenic <i>P. pellucida</i> under controllable expression of pKNOX1 showed increased leaf and seed size with a high percentage of fertile seed, whereas transgenic plants with p35S showed phenotypic features of bushy and small leaves, sterile pollen and lower reproductive fitness. Quantitative examination of <i>ipt</i>-positive gene expression in T<sub>3</sub> generation of transformants with pKNOX1 were 100% (line k-14) and 50% (line k-20), while 33.3% was observed in transgenic line c-11 with p35S. Interestingly, the endogenous cytokinin biosynthesis gene (<i>ipt3</i>) was significantly upregulated (2-3 folds higher) in pKNOX1-transformants. The overall relative mRNA expression of bacterial <i>ipt</i> gene and overproducing of cytokinin contents (t-ZR and 2-iP) detected in p35S-transformants caused abnormality and low percentages of transgene reproducible Interestingly, pKNOX1-transgenic plants tended to maintain chlorophyll contents 4-5 folds and extending the developmental cycle to 12.4 weeks (wk), which was 2 folds more than wildtype (5.8 wk) and p35S-transformants (7.4 wk). The promotor effect on stable and reproducible transgene-expressions demonstrated prominent features of <i>P. pellucida</i> and also empowered further omics studies.
