A cDNA expression library from Brassica juncea was introduced into the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to select for transformants tolerant to cadmium. Transformants expressing OXIDATIVE STRESS 3 (OXS3) or OXS3-Like cDNA exhibited enhanced tolerance to a range of metals and oxidizing chemicals. OXS3 belongs to a family of proteins that share a highly conserved domain corresponding to a putative N-acetyltransferase or thioltransferase catalytic site. Mutations within this conserved domain abolished the ability of Arabidopsis thaliana OXS3 to enhance stress tolerance in S. pombe, indicating a role in stress tolerance for the presumptive catalytic domain. A stress-sensitive mutant of AtOXS3 and enhanced tolerance of overexpression lines support the role of OXS3 in stress tolerance. The expression of tagged B. juncea and A. thaliana OXS3 proteins in plant cells revealed a subnuclear speckling pattern related to the nucleosome in discrete parts of the chromatin. It is possible that OXS3 might act as a chromatin remodeling factor for the stress response.
