A cDNA, up-regulated upon treatment of tobacco cells with salicylic acid and benzo (1,2,3) thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester, was identified by differential RNA display and the full sequence obtained. This mitochondrial gene, twin arginine translocation (tatC), resembles orthologues across different species, including the gene that codes for a sec-independent membrane translocating protein in bacteria. Hypothetical tatC proteins have also been identified in the mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana, Oenothera berteriana, Beta vulgaris, Oryza sativa and Marchantia polymorpha. Comparative protein analysis indicates a similar function for the tatC gene. The up-regulation of the tatC gene in a 3kbp transcript was confirmed by RNA gel blot analysis.
