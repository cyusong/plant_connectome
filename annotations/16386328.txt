Angiosperms do not synthesize chlorophyll in the dark. Here we show that leaf primordia in onion bulbs are green, though they developing in dark conditions. We present results that show plastids in green primordia are chloroplasts, and that they contain chlorophyll as well as embryos in seeds of certain angiosperms.
