<i>Ciborinia camelliae</i> Kohn is a camellia pathogen belonging to family Sclerotiniaceae, infecting only flowers of camellias. To better understand the virulence mechanism in this species, the draft genome sequence of the Italian strain of <i>C. camelliae</i> was obtained with a hybrid approach, combining Illumina HiSeq paired reads and MinIon Nanopore long-read sequencing. This combination improved significantly the existing National Center for Biotechnology Information reference genome. The assembly contiguity was implemented decreasing the contig number from 2,604 to 49. The N<sub>50</sub> contig size increased from 31,803 to 2,726,972 bp and the completeness of assembly increased from 94.5 to 97.3% according to BUSCO analysis. This work is foundational to allow functional analysis of the infection process in this scarcely known floral pathogen. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
