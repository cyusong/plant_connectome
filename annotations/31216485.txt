['31216485', 'The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is a conserved energy sensor that regulates  growth in response to environmental cues. However, little is known about the TOR  signaling pathway in plants. We used Arabidopsis lines affected in the lethal  with SEC13 protein 8 (LST8-1) gene, a core element of the TOR complex, to search  for suppressor mutations. Two suppressor lines with improved growth were isolated  that carried mutations in the Yet Another Kinase 1 (AtYAK1) gene encoding a  member of the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK)  family. Atyak1 mutations partly rescued the developmental defects of lst8-1-1  mutants and conferred resistance to the TOR inhibitor AZD-8055. Moreover, atyak1  mutations suppressed the transcriptomic and metabolic perturbations as well as  the abscisic acid (ABA) hypersensitivity of the lst8-1-1 mutants. AtYAK1  interacted with the regulatory-associated protein of TOR (RAPTOR), a component of  the TOR complex, and was phosphorylated by TOR. Thus, our findings reveal that  AtYAK1 is a TOR effector that probably needs to be switched off to activate plant  growth.', '2019 Jun 18', 'Cell Rep', '10.1016/j.celrep.2019.05.074', 'Meyer']
