Axillary bud development is a major factor that impacts plant architecture. A runner is an elongated shoot that develops from axillary bud and is frequently used for clonal propagation of strawberry. However, the genetic control underlying runner production is largely unknown. Here, we identified and characterized loss of axillary meristems (lam), an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant of the diploid woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) that lacked stamens in flowers and had reduced numbers of branch crowns and runners. The reduced branch crown and runner phenotypes were caused by a failure of axillary meristem initiation. The causative mutation of lam was located in FvH4_3g41310, which encodes a GRAS transcription factor, and was validated by a complementation test. lamCR mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 produced flowers without stamens and had fewer runners than the wild-type. LAM was broadly expressed in meristematic tissues. Gibberellic acid (GA) application induced runner outgrowth from the remaining buds in lam, but failed to do so at the empty axils of lam. In contrast, treatment with the GA biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol converted the runners into branch crowns. Moreover, genetic studies indicated that lam is epistatic to suppressor of runnerless (srl), a mutant of FveRGA1 in the GA pathway, during runner formation. Our results demonstrate that LAM is required for stamen and runner formation and acts sequentially with GA from bud initiation to runner outgrowth, providing insights into the molecular regulation of these economically important organs in strawberry.
