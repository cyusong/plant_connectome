Phosphorylation of alphabeta-tubulins dimers by protein tyrosine kinases plays an important role in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation in animal cells. In plants, however, the role of tubulin tyrosine phosphorylation is unknown and data on this tubulin modification are limited. In this study, we used an immunochemical approach to demonstrate that tubulin isolated by both immunoprecipitation and DEAE-chromatography is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in cultured cells of Nicotiana tabacum. This opens up the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation of tubulin could be involved in modulating the properties of plant microtubules.
