Specific DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosomal units occurs during programmed cell death (PCD) in both animal and plant cells, usually being regarded as an indicator of its apoptotic character. This internucleosomal DNA fragmentation is demonstrated in tobacco suspension and leaf cells, which were killed immediately by freezing in liquid nitrogen, and homogenization or treatment with Triton X-100. Although these cells could not activate and realize the respective enzymatic processes in a programmed manner, the character of DNA fragmentation was similar to that in the cells undergoing typical gradual PCD induced by 50 microM CdSO4. This internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was connected with the action of cysteine proteases and the loss of membrane, in particular tonoplast, integrity. The mechanisms of DNase activation in the rapidly killed cells, hypothetical biological relevance, and implications for the classification of cell death are discussed.
