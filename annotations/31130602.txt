Leaf blade width, curvature, and cuticular wax are important agronomic traits of rice. Here, we report the rice <i>Oschr4-5</i> mutant characterized by pleiotropic phenotypes, including narrow and rolled leaves, enhanced cuticular wax deposition and reduced plant height and tiller number. The reduced leaf width is caused by a reduced number of longitudinal veins and increased auxin content. The cuticular wax content was significantly higher in the <i>Oschr4-5</i> mutant, resulting in reduced water loss rate and enhanced drought tolerance. Molecular characterization reveals that a single-base deletion results in a frame-shift mutation from the second chromodomain of OsCHR4, a CHD3 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding) family chromatin remodeler, in the <i>Oschr4-5</i> mutant. Expressions of seven wax biosynthesis genes (<i>GL1-4</i>, <i>WSL4</i>, <i>OsCER7</i>, <i>LACS2</i>, <i>LACS7</i>, <i>ROC4</i> and <i>BDG</i>) and four auxin biosynthesis genes (<i>YUC2</i>, <i>YUC3</i>, <i>YUC5</i> and <i>YUC6</i>) was up-regulated in the <i>Oschr4-5</i> mutant. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the transcriptionally active histone modification H3K4me3 was increased, whereas the repressive H3K27me3 was reduced in the upregulated genes in the <i>Oschr4-5</i> mutant. Therefore, <i>OsCHR4</i> regulates leaf morphogenesis and cuticle wax formation by epigenetic modulation of auxin and wax biosynthetic genes expression.
