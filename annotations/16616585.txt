A highly basic peroxidase isoenzyme was shown to be released to the culture medium of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) hairy roots grown in Murashige-Skoog (MS) liquid medium when it was supplemented with 100 mM NaCl. In this paper we demonstrate that this enzyme is ionically bound to cell walls and that the release was a consequence of the continuous agitation of the tissue in a high ionic strength medium with salt addition. In order to establish the physiological role of this isoenzyme we partially purified it, and we analysed its kinetic properties as coniferyl alcohol peroxidase. The peroxidase isoenzyme showed a high catalytic efficiency for this substrate, which suggests that it would be associated with the ligno-suberization process. To confirm the involvement of this isoenzyme in that process, we studied the pattern of ligno-suberization of the tissue under different conditions of growth. Our results suggest that this basic peroxidase would be indeed involved in ligno-suberization since its leakage from cell walls, induced by 100 mM NaCl in liquid MS, caused less ligno-suberization of exo and endodermis. On the contrary, more ligno-suberization was seen in cell walls when the hairy roots were grown in a salt-supplemented MS solid medium without contact with it, a condition in which the release of the isoenzyme would be avoided. Thus, through the changes produced by the release of the enzyme from its site of action, we could demonstrate the physiological role of this peroxidase in the processing of root cell walls, being part of control mechanisms of ion and water fluxes through the root.
