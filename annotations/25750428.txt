Seeds are important to agriculture and conservation of plant biodiversity. In agriculture, seed germination performance is an important determinant of crop yield, in particular under adverse climatic conditions. Deterioration in seed quality is associated with the accumulation of cellular damage to macromolecules including lipids, protein, and DNA. Mechanisms that mitigate the deleterious cellular damage incurred in the quiescent state and in cycles of desiccation-hydration are crucial for the maintenance of seed viability and germination vigour. In early-imbibing seeds, damage to the embryo genome must be repaired prior to initiation of cell division to minimize growth inhibition and mutation of genetic information. Here we review recent advances that have established molecular links between genome integrity and seed quality. These studies identified that maintenance of genome integrity is particularly important to the seed stage of the plant lifecycle, revealing new insight into the physiological roles of plant DNA repair and recombination mechanisms. The high conservation of DNA repair and recombination factors across plant species underlines their potential as promising targets for the improvement of crop performance and development of molecular markers for prediction of seed vigour.
