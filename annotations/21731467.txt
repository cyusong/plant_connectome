Inflammation is a complex event linked to tissue damage whether by bacteria, physical trauma, chemical, heat or any other phenomenon. This physiological response is coordinated largely by a variety of chemical mediators that are released from the epithelium, the immunocytes and nerves of the lamina propria. However, if the factor that triggers the inflammation persists, the inflammation can become relentless, leading to an intensification of the lesion. The present work is a literature survey of plant extracts from the South American continent that have been reported to show anti-inflammatory activity. This review refers to 63 bacterial families of which the following stood out: Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Apocynaceae and Celastraceae, with their countries, parts used, types of extract used, model bioassays, organisms tested and their activity.

Asteraceae: !exhibits! anti-inflammatory activity
Fabaceae: !exhibits! anti-inflammatory activity
Euphorbiaceae: !exhibits! anti-inflammatory activity
Apocynaceae: !exhibits! anti-inflammatory activity
Celastraceae: !exhibits! anti-inflammatory activity
