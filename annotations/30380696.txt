In over 40 years of research on the cellular uptake of auxin it is somewhat chastening that we have elaborated so little on the original kinetic descriptions of auxin uptake by plant cells made by Rubery and Sheldrake in 1974. Every aspect of that seminal work has been investigated in detail, and the uptake activity they measured is now known to be attributed to the AUX1/LAX family of permeases. Recent pharmacological studies have defined the substrate specificity of AUX1, biochemical studies have evaluated its permeability to auxin in plant cell membranes, and rigourous kinetic studies have confirmed the affinity of AUX1 for IAA and synthetic auxins. Advances in genome sequencing have provided a rich resource for informatic analysis of the ancestry of AUX1 and the LAX proteins and, along with models of topology, suggest mechanistic links to families of eukaryotic proton co-transporters for which crystal structures have been presented. The insights gained from all the accumulated research reflect the brilliance of Rubery and Sheldrake's early work, but recent biochemical analyses are starting to advance further our understanding of this vitally important family of auxin transport proteins.
