Spatial heterogeneity of gas exchange rates in the leaves of Nicotiana tabacum L. (tobacco) was investigated. Leaf conductance to water vapour was higher (by about 18%) at the apical regions of leaves than at the basal ones. Local, small-scale measurements of pressure-volume (PV) parameters and water status (performed with a dewpoint hygrometer) revealed that bulk leaf water potential, osmotic potential, turgor pressure and bulk modulus of elasticity were not significantly different in the leaf apex or base. Hydraulic measurements showed that the apical regions of the leaf blade were about 30% more conductive than the basal regions. Such differences were explained by analogous differences in terms of venation patterns. In fact, vein density turned out to be higher (by about 13%) near the leaf apex with respect to the leaf base. On the contrary, stomatal density was the same both in the apical and basal leaf portions. Our data suggest that spatial stomatal heterogeneity may arise from heterogenous distribution of local hydraulic resistances and would be addressed to maintaining local water potential above critical values, possibly triggering vein cavitation.
