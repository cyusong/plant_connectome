['29852518', 'Environmental stresses are the major factors that limit productivity in plants.  Here, we report on the function of an uncharacterized gene At1g07050, encoding a  CCT domain-containing protein, from Arabidopsis thaliana. At1g07050 expression is  highly repressed by oxidative stress. We used metabolomics, biochemical, and  genomic approaches to analyse performance of transgenic lines with altered  expression of At1g07050 under normal and oxidative stress conditions. At1g07050  overexpressing lines showed increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS),  whereas knock-out mutants exhibited decreased levels of ROS and higher tolerance  to oxidative stress generated in the chloroplast. Our results uncover a role for  At1g07050 in cellular redox homeostasis controlling H(2) O(2) levels, due to  changes in enzymes, metabolites, and transcripts related to ROS detoxification.  Therefore, we call this gene FITNESS. Additionally, several genes such as ACD6,  PCC1, and ICS1 related to salicylic acid signalling and defence were found  differentially expressed among the lines. Notably, FITNESS absence significantly  improved seed yield suggesting an effective fine-tuning trade-off between  reproductive success and defence responses.', '2018 Oct', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.13354', 'ORCID:']
