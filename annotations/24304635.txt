Three different pathways of serine (Ser) biosynthesis have been described in plants: the Glycolate pathway, which is part of the Photorespiratory pathway, and 2 non-Photorespiratory pathways, the Glycerate and the Phosphorylated pathways. The Phosphorylated Pathway of Ser Biosynthesis (PPSB) has been known to exist since the 1950s, but its biological relevance was not revealed until quite recently when the last enzyme of the pathway, the Phosphoserine Phosphatase, was functionally characterized. In the associated study (1), we characterized a family of genes coding for putatite phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases (PGDH, 3-PGDH, and EDA9), the first enzyme of the PPSB. A metabolomics study using overexpressing plants indicated that all PGDH family genes were able to regulate Ser homeostasis but only lacking of EDA9 expression caused drastic developmental defects. We provided genetic and molecular evidence for the essential role of EDA9 for embryo and pollen development. Here, some new insights into the physiological/molecular function of PPSB and Ser are presented and discussed.
