Which sugar transporter regulates sugar accumulation in tubers is largely unknown. Accumulation of reducing sugar (RS) in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers negatively affects the quality of tubers undergoing the frying process. However, little is known about the genes involved in regulating RS content in tubers at harvest. Here, we have identified two tonoplast sugar transporter (TST) 3-type isoforms (StTST3.1 and StTST3.2) in potato. Quantitative real-time PCR results indicate that StTST3.1 and StTST3.2 possess distinct expression patterns in various potato tissues. StTST3.2 was found to be the expressed TST3-type isoform in tubers. Further subcellular localization analysis revealed that StTST3.2 was targeted to the tonoplast. Silencing of StTST3.2 in potato by stable transformation resulted in significantly lower RS content in tubers at harvest or after room temperature storage, suggesting StTST3.2 plays an important role in RS accumulation in tubers. Accordingly, compared with the unsilenced control, potato chips processed from StTST3.2-silenced tubers exhibited lighter color and dramatically decreased acrylamide production at harvest or after room temperature storage. In addition, we demonstrated that silencing of StTST3.2 has no significant effect on potato growth and development. Thus, suppression of StTST3.2 could be another effective approach for improving processing quality and decreasing acrylamide content in potato tubers.
