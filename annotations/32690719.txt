['32690719', 'SEIPIN proteins are localized to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-lipid droplet (LD)  junctions where they mediate the directional formation of LDs into the cytoplasm  in eukaryotic cells. Unlike in animal and yeast cells, which have single SEIPIN  genes, plants have three distinct SEIPIN isoforms encoded by separate genes. The  mechanism of SEIPIN action remains poorly understood, and here we demonstrate  that part of the function of two SEIPIN isoforms in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana), AtSEIPIN2 and AtSEIPIN3, may depend on their interaction with the  vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein (VAP) family member  AtVAP27-1. VAPs have well-established roles in the formation of membrane contact  sites and lipid transfer between the ER and other organelles, and here, we used a  combination of biochemical, cell biology, and genetics approaches to show that  AtVAP27-1 interacts with the N termini of AtSEIPIN2 and AtSEIPIN3 and likely  supports the normal formation of LDs. This insight indicates that the ER membrane  tethering machinery in plant cells could play a role with select SEIPIN isoforms  in LD biogenesis at the ER, and additional experimental evidence in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae supports the possibility that this interaction may be important in  other eukaryotic systems.', '2020 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00771', 'ORCID:']
