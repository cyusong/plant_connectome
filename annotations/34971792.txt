Nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as an important signal molecule in plants, having myriad roles in plant development. In addition, NO also orchestrates both biotic and abiotic stress responses, during which intensive cellular metabolic reprogramming occurs. Integral to these responses is the location of NO biosynthetic and scavenging pathways in diverse cellular compartments, enabling plants to effectively organize signal transduction pathways. NO regulates plant metabolism and, in turn, metabolic pathways reciprocally regulate NO accumulation and function. Thus, these diverse cellular processes are inextricably linked. This review addresses the numerous redox pathways, located in the various subcellular compartments that produce NO, in addition to the mechanisms underpinning NO scavenging. We focus on how this molecular dance is integrated into the metabolic state of the cell. Within this context, a reciprocal relationship between NO accumulation and metabolite production is often apparent. We also showcase cellular pathways, including those associated with nitrate reduction, that provide evidence for this integration of NO function and metabolism. Finally, we discuss the potential importance of the biochemical reactions governing NO levels in determining plant responses to a changing environment.
