Respiratory CO2 efflux and O2 uptake rates in leaves change in response to the growth CO2 concentration ([CO2]). The degrees of change vary depending on the responses of cellular processes such as nitrogen (N) assimilation and accumulation of organic acids to growth [CO2]. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined the respiratory characteristics of mature leaves of two rice varieties with different yield capacities at different growth stages under ambient and elevated [CO2] conditions at a free-air CO2 enrichment site. We also examined the effect of increased water temperature on leaf respiration. We measured the rates of CO2 efflux and O2 uptake, and determined N contents, primary metabolite contents and maximal activities of respiratory enzymes. The leaf CO2 efflux rates decreased in plants grown at elevated [CO2] in both varieties, and were higher in high-yielding Takanari than in Koshihikari. The leaf O2 uptake rates showed little change with respect to growth [CO2] and variety. The increased water temperature did not significantly affect the CO2 efflux and O2 uptake rates. The N and amino acid contents were significantly higher in Takanari than in Koshihikari. The enhanced N assimilation in Takanari may have consumed more respiratory NADH, leading to higher CO2 efflux rates. In Koshihikari, the ratio of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates changed and maximal activities of enzymes in the TCA cycle decreased at elevated [CO2]. Therefore, the decreased rates of CO2 efflux in Koshihikari may be due to the decreased activities of TCA cycle enzymes at elevated [CO2].
