TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR) proteins, a family of plant-specific transcription factors, play important roles in many developmental processes. However, genetic and functional redundancy among class I TCP limits the analysis of their biological roles. Here, we identified a dominant-negative mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana TCP7 named leaf curling-upward (lcu), which exhibits smaller leaf cells and shorter hypocotyls than the wild type, due to defective endoreplication. A septuple loss-of-function mutant of TCP7, TCP8, TCP14, TCP15, TCP21, TCP22, and TCP23 displayed similar developmental defects to those of lcu. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing showed that lcu and the septuple mutant share many misexpressed genes. Intriguingly, TCP7 directly targets the CYCLIN D1;1 (CYCD1;1) locus and activates its transcription. We determined that the C-terminus of TCP7 accounts for its transcriptional activation activity. Furthermore, the mutant protein LCU exhibited reduced transcriptional activation activity due to the introduction of an EAR-like repressive domain at its C-terminus. Together, these observations indicate that TCP7 plays important roles during leaf and hypocotyl development, redundantly, with at least six class I TCPs, and regulates the expression of CYCD1;1 to affect endoreplication in Arabidopsis.
