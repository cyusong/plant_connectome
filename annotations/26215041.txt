['26215041', "The circadian system allows plants to coordinate metabolic and physiological  functions with predictable environmental variables such as dusk and dawn. This  endogenous oscillator is comprised of biochemical and transcriptional rhythms  that are synchronized with a plant's surroundings via environmental signals,  including light and temperature. We have used chlorophyll fluorescence techniques  to describe circadian rhythms of PSII operating efficiency (Fq'/Fm') in the  chloroplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana. These Fq'/Fm' oscillations appear to be  influenced by transcriptional feedback loops previously described in the nucleus,  and are induced by rhythmic changes in photochemical quenching over circadian  time. Our work reveals that a family of blue photoreceptors, phototropins,  maintain robust rhythms of Fq'/Fm' under constant blue light. As phototropins do  not influence circadian gene expression in the nucleus our imaging methodology  highlights differences between the modulation of circadian outputs in distinct  subcellular compartments.", '2015 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12947', 'ORCID:']
