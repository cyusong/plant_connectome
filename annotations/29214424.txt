KEY MESSAGE: iTRAQ based proteomic identified key proteins and provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying somatic embryogenesis in cotton. Somatic embryogenesis, which involves cell dedifferentiation and redifferentiation, has been used as a model system for understanding molecular events of plant embryo development in vitro. In this study, we performed comparative proteomics analysis using samples of non-embryogenic callus (NEC), embryogenic callus (EC) and somatic embryo (SE) using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology. In total, 5892 proteins were identified amongst the three samples. The majority of these proteins (93.4%) were found to have catalytic activity, binding activity, transporter activity or structural molecular activity. Of these proteins, 1024 and 858 were differentially expressed in NEC versus EC and EC versus SE, respectively. Compared to NEC, EC had 452 and 572 down- and up-regulated proteins, respectively, and compared to EC, SE had 647 and 221 down- and up-regulated proteins, respectively. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis indicated that genetic information transmission, plant hormone transduction, glycolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism, galactose metabolism were the top pathways involved in somatic embryogenesis. Our proteomics results not only confirmed our previous transcriptomic results on the role of the polyamine metabolic pathways and stress responses in cotton somatic embryogenesis, but identified key proteins important for cotton somatic embryogenesis and provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying somatic embryogenesis in cotton.
