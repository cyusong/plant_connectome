['32563454', 'PUF proteins are a conserved group of sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins that  typically function to negatively regulate mRNA stability and translation. PUFs  are well characterized at the molecular, structural and functional levels in  Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, budding yeast and human systems. Although  usually encoded by small gene families, PUFs are over-represented in the plant  genome, with up to 36 genes identified in a single species. PUF gene expansion in  plants has resulted in extensive variability in gene expression patterns,  diversity in predicted RNA-binding domain structure, and novel combinations of  key amino acids involved in modular nucleotide binding. Reports on the  characterization of plant PUF structure and function continue to expand, and  include RNA target identification, subcellular distribution, crystal structure,  and molecular mechanisms. Arabidopsis PUF mutant analysis has provided insight  into biological function, and has identified roles related to development and  environmental stress tolerance. The diversity of plant PUFs implies an extensive  role for this family of proteins in post-transcriptional gene regulation. This  diversity also holds the potential for providing novel RNA-binding domains that  could be engineered to produce designer PUFs to alter the metabolism of target  RNAs in the cell.', '2020 Aug', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2020.110505', 'Muench']
