Tropical forests are often characterized by low soil phosphorus (P) availability, suggesting that P limits plant performance. However, how seedlings from different functional types respond to soil P availability is poorly known but important for understanding and modeling forest dynamics under changing environmental conditions. We grew four nitrogen (N)-fixing Fabaceae and seven diverse non-N-fixing tropical dry forest tree species in a shade house under three P fertilization treatments and evaluated carbon (C) allocation responses, P demand, P-use, investment in P acquisition traits, and correlations among P acquisition traits. Nitrogen fixers grew larger with increasing P addition in contrast to non-N fixers, which showed fewer responses in C allocation and P use. Foliar P increased with P addition for both functional types, while P acquisition strategies did not vary among treatments but differed between functional types, with N fixers showing higher root phosphatase activity (RPA) than nonfixers. Growth responses suggest that N fixers are limited by P, but nonfixers may be limited by other resources. However, regardless of limitation, P acquisition traits such as mycorrhizal colonization and RPA were nonplastic across a steep P gradient. Differential limitation among plant functional types has implications for forest succession and earth system models.
