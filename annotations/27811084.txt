Capturing the full growth potential in crops under future elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations would be facilitated by improved understanding of eCO<sub>2</sub> effects on uptake and use of mineral nutrients. This study investigates interactions of eCO<sub>2</sub>, soil phosphorus (P), and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis in Medicago truncatula and Brachypodium distachyon grown under the same conditions. The focus was on eCO<sub>2</sub> effects on vegetative growth, efficiency in acquisition and use of P, and expression of phosphate transporter (PT) genes. Growth responses to eCO<sub>2</sub> were positive at P sufficiency, but under low-P conditions they ranged from non-significant in M. truncatula to highly significant in B. distachyon Growth of M. truncatula was increased by AM at low P conditions at both CO<sub>2</sub> levels and eCO<sub>2</sub>×AM interactions were sparse. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> had small effects on P acquisition, but enhanced conversion of tissue P into biomass. Expression of PT genes was influenced by eCO<sub>2</sub>, but effects were inconsistent across genes and species. The ability of eCO<sub>2</sub> to partly mitigate P limitation-induced growth reductions in B. distachyon was associated with enhanced P use efficiency, and requirements for P fertilizers may not increase in such species in future CO<sub>2</sub>-rich climates.
