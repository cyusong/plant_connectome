Over the last decade or so important progress has been made in identifying and understanding a set of patterning mechanisms that have the potential to explain many aspects of plant morphology. These include the feedback loop between mechanical stresses and interphase microtubules, the regulation of plant cell polarity and the role of adaxial and abaxial cell type boundaries. What is perhaps most intriguing is how these mechanisms integrate in a combinatorial manner that provides a means to generate a large variety of commonly seen plant morphologies. Here, I review our current understanding of these mechanisms and discuss the links between them.

Mechanical stresses: !affects! Interphase microtubules
Adaxial/Abaxial cell type boundaries: !regulate! Plant cell polarity
Feedback loop: !integrates! Combinatorial manner
Combinatorial manner: !generates! Variety of plant morphologies
