Histone modification influences gene expression. Among histone modifications, H3K27me3 is associated with downregulation of nearby genes via chromatin compaction. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, a subset of JUMONJI C DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN (JMJ) proteins play a critical role in removal of H3K27me3 during plant development or in response to environmental cues. However, the regulation of H3K27me3 demethylase gene expression is not yet fully characterized. In this study, we computationally characterized the expression patterns of JMJ H3K27me3 demethylase genes using public transcriptome datasets created across plant development and after various environmental cues. Consistent with the available transcriptome datasets, GUS staining validated that <i>JMJ30</i> was highly expressed in the L1 layer of the shoot apical meristem. Furthermore, expression data for panel of five H3K27me3 demethylase genes revealed <i>JMJ30</i> to be the most highly affected by abiotic and biotic stress. In addition, <i>JMJ30</i> expression was variable between <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> accessions. Finally, the expression of a <i>JMJ30</i> orthologue from the related species <i>Arabidopsis halleri, AhgJMJ30</i>, fluctuated under field conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that transcriptional changes of H3K27me3 demethylase genes may play key roles in development and environmental responses.
