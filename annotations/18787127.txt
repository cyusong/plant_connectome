['18787127', 'The endocycle represents an alternative cell cycle that is activated in various  developmental processes, including placental formation, Drosophila oogenesis, and  leaf development. In endocycling cells, mitotic cell cycle exit is followed by  successive doublings of the DNA content, resulting in polyploidy. The timing of  endocycle onset is crucial for correct development, because polyploidization is  linked with cessation of cell division and initiation of terminal  differentiation. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activator genes  CDH1, FZR, and CCS52 are known to promote endocycle onset in human, Drosophila,  and Medicago species cells, respectively; however, the genetic pathways governing  development-dependent APC/C(CDH1/FZR/CCS52) activity remain unknown. We report  that the atypical E2F transcription factor E2Fe/DEL1 controls the expression of  the CDH1/FZR orthologous CCS52A2 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana. E2Fe/DEL1  misregulation resulted in untimely CCS52A2 transcription, affecting the timing of  endocycle onset. Correspondingly, ectopic CCS52A2 expression drove cells into the  endocycle prematurely. Dynamic simulation illustrated that E2Fe/DEL1 accounted  for the onset of the endocycle by regulating the temporal expression of CCS52A2  during the cell cycle in a development-dependent manner. Analogously, the  atypical mammalian E2F7 protein was associated with the promoter of the  APC/C-activating CDH1 gene, indicating that the transcriptional control of APC/C  activator genes by atypical E2Fs might be evolutionarily conserved.', '2008 Sep 23', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0806510105', 'De']
