['20739610', 'SHORT-ROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR) are required for stem cell maintenance in  the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root meristem, ensuring its indeterminate  growth. Mutation of SHR and SCR genes results in disorganization of the quiescent  center and loss of stem cell activity, resulting in the cessation of root growth.  This paper reports on the role of SHR and SCR in the development of leaves,  which, in contrast to the root, have a determinate growth pattern and lack a  persistent stem cell niche. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of leaf  growth in shr and scr mutants is not a secondary effect of the compromised root  development but is caused by an effect on cell division in the leaves: a reduced  cell division rate and early exit of the proliferation phase. Consistent with the  observed cell division phenotype, the expression of SHR and SCR genes in leaves  is closely associated with cell division activity in most cell types. The  increased cell cycle duration is due to a prolonged S-phase duration, which is  mediated by up-regulation of cell cycle inhibitors known to restrain the activity  of the transcription factor, E2Fa. Therefore, we conclude that, in contrast to  their specific roles in cortex/endodermis differentiation and stem cell  maintenance in the root, SHR and SCR primarily function as general regulators of  cell proliferation in leaves.', '2010 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.158857', 'Beemster']
