['31173100', 'CEPs (C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDEs) inhibit Arabidopsis primary root growth by  unknown mechanisms. We investigated how CEP3 levels control primary root growth.  CEP3 peptide application decreased cell division, S-phase cell number, root  meristematic cell number, and meristem zone (MZ) size in a dose- and CEP  RECEPTOR1-dependent manner. Grafting showed that CEP3-dependent growth inhibition  requires root and shoot CEPR1. CEP3 induced mitotic quiescence in MZ cells  significantly faster than that induced by nutrient limitation alone. CEP3 also  inhibited the restoration of S-phase to mitotically quiescence cells by nutrient  resupply without quantitatively reducing TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase  activity. In contrast, cep3-1 had an increased meristem size and S-phase cell  number under nitrogen (N)-limited conditions, but not under N-sufficient  conditions. Furthermore, cep3-1 meristematic cells remained in S-phase longer  than wild-type cells during a sustained carbon (C) and N limitation. RNA  sequencing showed that CEP3 peptide down-regulated genes involved in S-phase  entry, cell wall and ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication, and meristem  expansion, and up-regulated genes involved in catabolic processes and proteins  and peptides that negatively control meristem expansion and root growth. Many of  these genes were reciprocally regulated in cep3-1. The results suggest that  raising CEP3 induces starvation-related responses that curtail primary root  growth under severe nutrient limitation.', '2019 Sep 24', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erz270', 'Djordjevic']
