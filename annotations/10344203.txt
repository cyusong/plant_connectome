['10344203', 'Transgenic arabidopsis plants were isolated that contained a T-DNA construct in  which the promoter of an auxin-inducible glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene  from tobacco was fused to the kanamycin resistance (nptII) as well as to the  beta-glucuronidase (gusA) reporter gene. Subsequently, seeds were treated with  EMS to obtain mutants in which both reporter gene fusions were up-regulated.  Northern analysis showed that the mRNA level of a related, endogenous  auxin-inducible GST gene of Arabidopsis was increased in some of these mutants as  well. Two of the gup (GST up-regulated) mutants were characterized in more detail  and roughly mapped. Both had epinastic cotyledons and leaves, a phenotype that  turned out to be linked to the gup mutation.', '1999 Mar', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1006129426712', 'Hooykaas']
