The development of knockout mutants and expression variants are critical for understanding genotype-phenotype relationships. However, advances in these techniques in gram-positive actinobacteria have stagnated over the last decade. Actinobacteria in the <i>Clavibacter</i> genus are composed of diverse crop pathogens that cause a variety of wilt and cankering diseases. Here, we present a suite of tools for genetic manipulation in the tomato pathogen <i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i> including a markerless deletion system, an integrative plasmid, and an R package for identification of permissive sites for plasmid integration. The vector pSelAct-KO is a recombination-based, markerless knockout system that uses dual selection to engineer seamless deletions of a region of interest, providing opportunities for repeated higher-order genetic knockouts. The efficacy of pSelAct-KO was demonstrated in <i>C. michiganensis</i> and was confirmed using whole-genome sequencing. We developed permissR, an R package to identify permissive sites for chromosomal integration, which can be used in conjunction with pSelAct-Express, a nonreplicating integrative plasmid that enables recombination into a permissive genomic location. Expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein by pSelAct-Express was verified in two candidate permissive regions predicted by permissR in <i>C. michiganensis</i>. These molecular tools are essential advances for investigating gram-positive actinobacteria, particularly for important pathogens in the <i>Clavibacter</i> genus.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
