In cell-cell communication, noncell-autonomous transcription factors play vital roles in controlling plant stem cell fate. We previously reported that AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 (ARF3), a member of the ARF family with critical roles in floral meristem maintenance and determinacy, has a distinct accumulation pattern that differs from the expression domain of its encoding gene in the shoot apical meristem (SAM). However, the biological meaning of this difference is obscure. Here, we demonstrate that ARF3 expression in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is mainly activated at the periphery of the SAM by auxin where ARF3 cell autonomously regulates the expression of meristem-organ boundary-specific genes, such as CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1-3 (CUC1-3), BLADE ON PETIOLE1-2 (BOP1-2), and TARGETS UNDER ETTIN CONTROL3 (TEC3) to regulate the arrangement of organs in regular pattern, a phenomenon referred to as phyllotaxis. We also show that ARF3 is translocated into the organizing center where it represses cytokinin activity and WUSCHEL expression to regulate meristem activity noncell-autonomously. Therefore, ARF3 acts as a molecular link that mediates the interaction of auxin and cytokinin signaling in the SAM while coordinating the balance between meristem maintenance and organogenesis. Our findings reveal an ARF3-mediated coordination mechanism through cell-cell communication in dynamic SAM maintenance.
