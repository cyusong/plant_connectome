Mitochondrial function relies on the assembly of electron transport chain complexes, which requires coordination between proteins encoded by the mitochondrion and those of the nucleus. Here, we cloned a maize (Zea mays) cytochrome c maturation FN stabilizer1 (CNS1) and found it encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein. Members of the PPR family are widely distributed in plants and are associated with RNA metabolism in organelles. P-type PPR proteins play essential roles in stabilizing the 3'-end of RNA in mitochondria; whether a similar process exists for stabilizing the 5'-terminus of mitochondrial RNA remains unclear. The kernels of cns1 exhibited arrested embryo and endosperm development, whereas neither conventional splicing deficiency nor RNA editing difference in mitochondrial genes was observed. Instead, most of the ccmFN transcripts isolated from cns1 mutant plants were 5'-truncated and therefore lacked the start codon. Biochemical and molecular data demonstrated that CNS1 is a P-type PPR protein encoded by nuclear DNA and that it localizes to the mitochondrion. Also, one binding site of CNS1 located upstream of the start codon in the ccmFN transcript. Moreover, abnormal mitochondrial morphology and dramatic upregulation of alternative oxidase genes were observed in the mutant. Together, these results indicate that CNS1 is essential for reaching a suitable level of intact ccmFN transcripts through binding to the 5'-UTR of the RNAs and maintaining 5'-integrity, which is crucial for sustaining mitochondrial complex III function to ensure mitochondrial biogenesis and seed development in maize.
