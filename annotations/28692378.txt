Thioredoxins (Trxs) play a relevant role in thiol-dependent redox regulation, which allows the rapid adaptation of chloroplast metabolism to unpredictable environmental conditions. In chloroplasts, Trxs use reducing equivalents provided by photoreduced ferredoxin (Fdx) via the action of a ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (FTR), thus linking redox regulation to light. In addition, these organelles contain an NADPH-thioredoxin reductase, NTRC, with a Trx domain at the C-terminus. NTRC efficiently reduces 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prxs), hence having antioxidant function. However, NTRC also participates in the redox regulation of processes, such as starch and chlorophyll biosynthesis, which are known to be regulated by Trxs. Thus, the question arising is whether there is a cross-talk between the 2 redox systems. Arabidopsis mutants simultaneously devoid of NTRC and Trx x or Trxs f show a dramatic growth inhibition phenotype, indicating that NTRC is required for the function of these unrelated Trxs. Remarkably, both the ntrc-trxx double mutant and, to a higher extent, the ntrc-trxf1f2 triple mutant show high mortality at the seedling stage, which is rescued by sucrose. These findings show the relevant role of redox regulation for chloroplast performance and uncover the key function of cotyledons chloroplasts at the transition to autotrophic metabolism during seedling establishment.
