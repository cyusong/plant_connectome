In this glossary of plant cell structures, we asked experts to summarize a present-day view of plant organelles and structures, including a discussion of outstanding questions. In the following short reviews, the authors discuss the complexities of the plant cell endomembrane system, exciting connections between organelles, novel insights into peroxisome structure and function, dynamics of mitochondria, and the mysteries that need to be unlocked from the plant cell wall. These discussions are focused through a lens of new microscopy techniques. Advanced imaging has uncovered unexpected shapes, dynamics, and intricate membrane formations. With a continued focus in the next decade, these imaging modalities coupled with functional studies are sure to begin to unravel mysteries of the plant cell.
