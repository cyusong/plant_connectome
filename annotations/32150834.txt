['32150834', 'Arabidopsis contains 34 genes for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored  LTPg proteins. A motif analysis has placed these into four groups. With one  exception, all are produced with a signal peptide and are most likely attached to  the cell membrane via the GPI anchor. Several of the LTPg genes across the four  groups are downregulated in syncytia induced by the beet cyst nematode Heterodera  schachtii. We have here studied At3g22600 encoding LTPg5, which is the most  strongly downregulated LTPg gene. It is mainly expressed in roots, and a  promoter::GUS line was used to confirm the downregulation in syncytia and also  showed downregulation in galls of the root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita.  In contrast, infection with bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae) and fungi (Botrytis  cinerea) led to the induction of the gene in leaves. This diverse regulation of  LTPg5 indicated a role in resistance, which we confirmed with overexpression  lines and a T-DNA mutant. The overexpression lines were more resistant to both  nematode species and to P. syringae and B. cinerea, while a knock-out mutant was  more susceptible to H. schachtii and P. syringae. Thus, LTPg5 encoded by  At3g22600 is part of the Arabidopsis resistance mechanism against pathogens.  LTPg5 has probably no direct antimicrobial activity but could perhaps act by  associating with a receptor-like kinase, leading to the induction of defense  genes such as PR1.', '2020 Mar 5', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms21051774', 'Bohlmann']
