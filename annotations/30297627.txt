Early maturity is one of the most important agronomical traits in potato breeding. To identify the DNA segment that codes for early maturity, a tetraploid potato segregation population of "Zhongshu 19" × "Zhongshu 3" was genetically analyzed, using a combination of high throughput simplified genome sequencing (2b-RAD) and bulked segregant analysis (BSA). The DNA segment related to the early-maturity trait was identified at the 3.7~4.2 Mb locus on the short arm of chromosome 5. Eight molecular markers were developed, of which five were closely linked to the early-maturity trait loci. Additionally, 42 simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers were constructed based on the reference sequence of <i>Solanum tuberosum</i> group Phureja DM1-3 516 R44 (DM). Using the TetraploidMap software, the linkage map of chromosome 5 was constructed with 50 markers. The total map length was 172 centiMorgan (cM), with an average genetic distance of 3.44 cM. Correlating molecular and phenotypic data of the segregating population, the mapped Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) on the short arm of chromosome 5 contributed to 33.55% of the early-maturity phenotype. The early-maturity QTL was located at 84 cM, flanked by the SSR5-85-1 and SCAR5-8 markers. The QTL was fine-mapped to 471 kb. Using DNA sequence annotation, 34 genes were identified in this region, 12 of them with unknown function. Among the other 22 annotated genes, E3 ubiquitin ligase gene <i>PUB14</i> could be related to maturity and regulation of tuber formation. The constructed QTL map is a useful basic tool for the cloning of early-maturity related genes in tetraploid potatoes.
