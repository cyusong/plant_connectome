['12172017', 'The POLARIS (PLS) gene of Arabidopsis was identified as a promoter trap  transgenic line, showing beta-glucuronidase fusion gene expression predominantly  in the embryonic and seedling root, with low expression in aerial parts. Cloning  of the PLS locus revealed that the promoter trap T-DNA had inserted into a short  open reading frame (ORF). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR, RNA gel blot  analysis, and RNase protection assays showed that the PLS ORF is located within a  short ( approximately 500 nucleotides) auxin-inducible transcript and encodes a  predicted polypeptide of 36 amino acid residues. pls mutants exhibit a short-root  phenotype and reduced vascularization of leaves. pls roots are hyperresponsive to  exogenous cytokinins and show increased expression of the cytokinin-inducible  gene ARR5/IBC6 compared with the wild type. pls seedlings also are less  responsive to the growth-inhibitory effects of exogenous auxin and show reduced  expression of the auxin-inducible gene IAA1 compared with the wild type. The PLS  peptide-encoding region of the cDNA partially complements the pls mutation and  requires the PLS ORF ATG for activity, demonstrating the functionality of the  peptide-encoding ORF. Ectopic expression of the PLS ORF reduces root growth  inhibition by exogenous cytokinins and increases leaf vascularization. We propose  that PLS is required for correct auxin-cytokinin homeostasis to modulate root  growth and leaf vascular patterning.', '2002 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.002618', 'Lindsey']
