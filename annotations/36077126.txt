Sustainable agriculture is increasingly being put in danger by environmental contamination with dangerous heavy metals (HMs), especially lead (Pb). Plants have developed a sophisticated mechanism for nitric oxide (NO) production and signaling to regulate hazardous effects of abiotic factors, including HMs. In the current study, we investigated the role of exogenously applied sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a nitric oxide (NO) donor) in ameliorating the toxic effects of lead (Pb) on rice. For this purpose, plants were subjected to 1.2 mM Pb alone and in combination with 100 然 SNP. We found that under 1.2 mM Pb stress conditions, the accumulation of oxidative stress markers, including hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (37%), superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) (28%), malondialdehyde (MDA) (33%), and electrolyte leakage (EL) (34%), was significantly reduced via the application of 100 然 SNP. On the other hand, under the said stress of Pb, the activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO) (60%), peroxidase (POD) (28%), catalase (CAT) (26%), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (42%), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) (58%) was significantly increased via the application of 100 然 SNP. In addition, the application of 100 然 SNP rescued agronomic traits such as plant height (24%), number of tillers per plant (40%), and visible green pigments (44%) when the plants were exposed to 1.2 mM Pb stress. Furthermore, after exposure to 1.2 mM Pb stress, the expression of the heavy-metal stress-related genes <i>OsPCS1</i> (44%), <i>OsPCS2</i> (74%), <i>OsMTP1</i> (83%), <i>OsMTP5</i> (53%), <i>OsMT-I-1a</i> (31%), and <i>OsMT-I-1b</i> (24%) was significantly enhanced via the application of 100 然 SNP. Overall, our research evaluates that exogenously applied 100 mM SNP protects rice plants from the oxidative damage brought on by 1.2 mM Pb stress by lowering oxidative stress markers, enhancing the antioxidant system and the transcript accumulation of HMs stress-related genes.
