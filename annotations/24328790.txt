['24328790', "Calcium is an important second messenger in eukaryotic cells that regulates many  different cellular processes. To elucidate calcium regulation in chloroplasts, we  identified the targets of calcium-dependent phosphorylation within the stromal  proteome. A 73 kDa protein was identified as one of the most dominant proteins  undergoing phosphorylation in a calcium-dependent manner in the stromal extracts  of both Arabidopsis and Pisum. It was identified as TKL (transketolase), an  essential enzyme of both the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and the oxidative  pentose phosphate pathway. Calcium-dependent phosphorylation of both Arabidopsis  isoforms (AtTKL1 and AtTKL2) could be confirmed in vitro using recombinant  proteins. The phosphorylation is catalysed by a stroma-localized protein kinase,  which cannot utilize GTP. Phosphorylation of AtTKL1, the dominant isoform in most  tissues, occurs at a serine residue that is conserved in TKLs of vascular plants.  By contrast, an aspartate residue is present in this position in cyanobacteria,  algae and mosses. Characterization of a phosphomimetic mutant (S428D) indicated  that Ser428 phosphorylation exerts significant effects on the enzyme's substrate  saturation kinetics at specific physiological pH values. The results of the  present study point to a role for TKL phosphorylation in the regulation of carbon  allocation.", '2014 Mar 1', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BJ20130631', 'Vothknecht']
