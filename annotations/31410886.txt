Volatiles mediate the interaction of plants with pollinators, herbivores and their natural enemies, other plants and micro-organisms. With increasing knowledge about these interactions the underlying mechanisms turn out to be increasingly complex. The mechanisms of biosynthesis and perception of volatiles are slowly being uncovered. The increasing scientific knowledge can be used to design and apply volatile-based agricultural strategies.
