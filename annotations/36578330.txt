In order to promote sugarcane pre-cut seed good seed and good method planting technology, we combine the development of sugarcane pre-cut seed intelligent 0p99oposeed cutting machine to realize the accurate and fast identification and cutting of sugarcane stem nodes. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to improve YOLOv4-Tiny for sugarcane stem node recognition. Based on the original YOLOv4-Tiny network, the three maximum pooling layers of the original YOLOv4-tiny network were replaced with SPP (Spatial Pyramid Pooling) modules, which fuse the local and global features of the images and enhance the accurate localization ability of the network. And a 1×1 convolution module was added to each feature layer to reduce the parameters of the network and improve the prediction speed of the network. On the sugarcane dataset, compared with the Faster-RCNN algorithm and YOLOv4 algorithm, the improved algorithm yielded an mean accuracy precision (MAP) of 99.11%, a detection accuracy of 97.07%, and a transmission frame per second (fps) of 30, which can quickly and accurately detect and identify sugarcane stem nodes. In this paper, the improved algorithm is deployed in the sugarcane stem node fast identification and dynamic cutting system to achieve accurate and fast sugarcane stem node identification and cutting in real time. It improves the seed cutting quality and cutting efficiency and reduces the labor intensity.
