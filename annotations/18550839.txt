['18550839', 'The processing of Arabidopsis thaliana microRNAs (miRNAs) from longer primary  transcripts (pri-miRNAs) requires the activity of several proteins, including  DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), the double-stranded RNA-binding protein HYPONASTIC LEAVES1  (HYL1), and the zinc finger protein SERRATE (SE). It has been noted before that  the morphological appearance of weak se mutants is reminiscent of plants with  mutations in ABH1/CBP80 and CBP20, which encode the two subunits of the nuclear  cap-binding complex. We report that, like SE, the cap-binding complex is  necessary for proper processing of pri-miRNAs. Inactivation of either ABH1/CBP80  or CBP20 results in decreased levels of mature miRNAs accompanied by apparent  stabilization of pri-miRNAs. Whole-genome tiling array analyses reveal that se,  abh1/cbp80, and cbp20 mutants also share similar splicing defects, leading to the  accumulation of many partially spliced transcripts. This is unlikely to be an  indirect consequence of improper miRNA processing or other mRNA turnover  pathways, because introns retained in se, abh1/cbp80, and cbp20 mutants are not  affected by mutations in other genes required for miRNA processing or for  nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Taken together, our results uncover dual roles in  splicing and miRNA processing that distinguish SE and the cap-binding complex  from specialized miRNA processing factors such as DCL1 and HYL1.', '2008 Jun 24', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0802493105', 'Weigel']
