The Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex (Closterium, Zygnematophyceae) has an isogamous mating system. Members of the Zygnematophyceae are the closest relatives to extant land plants and are distantly related to chlorophytic models, for which a genetic basis of mating type (MT) determination has been reported. We thus investigated MT determination in Closterium. We sequenced genomes representing the two MTs, mt+ and mt-, in Closterium and identified CpMinus1, a gene linked to the mt- phenotype. We analyzed its function using reverse genetics methods. CpMinus1 encodes a divergent RWP-RK domain-containing-like transcription factor and is specifically expressed during gamete differentiation. Introduction of CpMinus1 into an mt+ strain was sufficient to convert it to a phenotypically mt- strain, while CpMinus1-knockout mt- strains were phenotypically mt+. We propose that CpMinus1 is the major MT determinant that acts by evoking the mt- phenotype and suppressing the mt+ phenotype in heterothallic Closterium. CpMinus1 likely evolved independently in the Zygnematophyceae lineage, which lost an egg-sperm anisogamous mating system. mt- specific regions possibly constitute an MT locus flanked by common sequences that undergo some recombination.
