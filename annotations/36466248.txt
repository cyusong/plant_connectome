Flooding entails different stressful conditions leading to low oxygen availability for respiration and as a result plants experience hypoxia. Stress imposed by hypoxia affects cellular metabolism, including the formation of toxic metabolites that dramatically reduce crop productivity. Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are a group of enzymes participating in various aspects of plant growth, development and stress responses. Although we have knowledge concerning the multiple functionalities of ALDHs in tolerance to various stresses, the engagement of ALDH in plant metabolism adjustment to hypoxia is poorly recognized. Therefore, we explored the <i>ALDH</i> gene superfamily in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Genome-wide analyses revealed that 16 <i>AtALDH</i> genes are organized into ten families and distributed irregularly across <i>Arabidopsis</i> 5 chromosomes. According to evolutionary relationship studies from different plant species, the <i>ALDH</i> gene superfamily is highly conserved. <i>AtALDH2</i> and <i>ALDH3</i> are the most numerous families in plants, while <i>ALDH18</i> was found to be the most distantly related. The analysis of <i>cis</i>-acting elements in promoters of <i>AtALDHs</i> indicated that <i>AtALDHs</i> participate in responses to light, phytohormones and abiotic stresses. Expression profile analysis derived from qRT-PCR showed the <i>AtALDH2B7</i>, <i>AtALDH3H1</i> and <i>AtALDH5F1</i> genes as the most responsive to hypoxia stress. In addition, the expression of <i>AtALDH18B1</i>, <i>AtALDH18B2</i>, <i>AtALDH2B4</i>, and <i>AtALDH10A8</i> was highly altered during the post-hypoxia-reoxygenation phase. Taken together, we provide comprehensive functional information on the <i>ALDH</i> gene superfamily in Arabidopsis during hypoxia stress and highlight <i>ALDHs</i> as a functional element of hypoxic systemic responses. These findings might help develop a framework for application in the genetic improvement of crop plants.
