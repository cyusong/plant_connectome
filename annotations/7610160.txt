['7610160', 'Kinetic aspects of ethylene-mediated signal transduction leading to  seedling-growth inhibition and chitinase induction in Arabidopsis were  investigated by the introduction of defined mutations in components of these  pathways. Dose-response analysis of wild-type responses indicated that the  rate-limiting steps for seedling responses and Arabidopsis basic-chitinase  induction displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with apparent dissociation  constants of the response (Kr) of 0.1 and 1.4 microL L-1 ethylene, respectively.  In the ethylene-insensitive etr1-1 and ein2-32 mutant lines, both Arabidopsis  basic-chitinase induction and seedling-growth responses were completely  disrupted, whereas the weaker etr1-2 allele eliminated the chitinase-induction  response but only partially disrupted the seedling responses. A heterologous  reporter gene containing the chitinase promoter from bean (bean  basic-chitinase-beta-glucuronidase) displayed subsensitive kinetics (Kr 120  microL L-1 ethylene) compared to the response of the endogenous basic-chitinase  response (Kr 1.4 microL L-1 ethylene). A model for ethylene signal transduction  that accounts for the observed variation in ethylene dose-response relationships  is presented. The relationship between the model and the biochemical mechanisms  of well-characterized signal-transduction systems in animals is discussed.', '1995 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.2.597', 'Bleecker']
