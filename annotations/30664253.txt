The isohydry-anisohydry spectrum has become a popular way to characterize plant drought responses and recovery processes. Despite the proven utility of this framework for understanding the interconnected physiological changes plants undergo in response to water stress, new challenges have arisen pertaining to the traits and tradeoffs that underlie this concept. To test the utility of this framework for understanding hydraulic traits, drought physiology and recovery, we applied a 6 wk experimental soil moisture reduction to seven tree species followed by a 6 wk recovery period. Throughout, we measured hydraulic traits and monitored changes in gas exchange, leaf water potential, and hydraulic conductivity. Species' hydraulic traits were not coordinated, as some anisohydric species had surprisingly low resistance to embolism (P<sub>50</sub> ) and negative safety margins. In addition to widespread hydraulic damage, these species also experienced reductions in photosynthesis and stem water potential during water stress, and delayed recovery time. Given that we observed no benefit of being anisohydric either during or after drought, our results indicate the need to reconsider the traits and tradeoffs that underlie anisohydric behavior, and to consider the environmental, biological and edaphic processes that could allow this strategy to flourish in forests.
