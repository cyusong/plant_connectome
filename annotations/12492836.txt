['12492836', 'Plant growth is regulated by bioactive gibberellin (GA), although there is an  unexplained diversity in the magnitude of the GA responses exhibited by different  plant species. GA acts via a group of orthologous proteins known as the DELLA  proteins. The Arabidopsis genome contains genes encoding five different DELLA  proteins, the best known of which are GAI and RGA. The DELLA proteins are thought  to act as repressors of GA-regulated processes, whilst GA is thought to act as a  negative regulator of DELLA protein function. Recent experiments have shown that  GA induces rapid disappearance of nuclear RGA, SLR1 and SLN1 (DELLA proteins from  rice and barley), suggesting that GA signalling and degradation of DELLA proteins  are coupled. However, RGL1, another Arabidopsis DELLA protein, does not disappear  from the nucleus in response to GA treatment. Here, we present evidence  suggesting that GAI, like RGL1, is stable in response to GA treatment, and show  that transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing constructs that enable high-level  expression of GAI exhibit a dwarf, GA non-responsive phenotype. Thus, GAI appears  to be less affected by GA than RGA, SLR1 or SLN1. We also show that neither of  the two putative nuclear localisation signals contained in DELLA proteins are  individually necessary for nuclear localisation of GAI. The various DELLA  proteins have different properties, and we suggest that this functional diversity  may explain, at least in part, why plant species differ widely in their GA  response magnitudes.', '2002 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2002.01478.x', 'Harberd']
