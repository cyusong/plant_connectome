Alkali grass (Puccinellia tenuiflora), a monocotyledonous halophyte, can serve as a model of salt tolerance in monocotyledon crops. To elucidate the molecular events associated with salt tolerance in alkali grass, we generated a directional cDNA library from leaves treated with the alkali salt, NaHCO3. Large-scale sequencing of the cDNA library identified 2942 ESTs representing 2366 non-redundant transcripts. These have been deposited in the dbEST division of GenBank. BLASTX evaluation indicated that 1274 of the ESTs were homologous to various known genes/proteins in a broad range of organisms, especially gramineae species. The other 1092 ESTs, which showed little if any homology to known sequences, were considered novel. Based on the encoded proteins, the 1274 identified ESTs fell into 12 functional categories, of which four were abundant, namely metabolism (18.84%), transcription (12.48%), unclassified (11.22%) and cell rescue/defense (9.66%). The 162 unique transcripts corresponding to possible salt-related genes were also identified. This study provides an overview of gene expression in NaHCO3-stressed alkali grass, as well as useful information for further investigation of salt resistance in plants.
