Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play essential signaling roles in cells by oxidative post-translational modification within suitable ranges of concentration. All of them contribute to the balance of redox and are involved in the DNA damage and repair pathways. However, the damage and repair pathways of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are complicated, and the interactions among NO, H<sub>2</sub>S, ROS, and mtDNA damage are also intricate. This article summarized the current knowledge about the metabolism of H<sub>2</sub>S, NO, and ROS and their roles in maintaining redox balance and regulating the repair pathway of mtDNA damage in plants. The three reactive species may likely influence each other in their generation, elimination, and signaling actions, indicating a crosstalk relationship between them. In addition, NO and H<sub>2</sub>S are reported to be involved in epigenetic variations by participating in various cell metabolisms, including (nuclear and mitochondrial) DNA damage and repair. Nevertheless, the research on the details of NO and H<sub>2</sub>S in regulating DNA damage repair of plants is in its infancy, especially in mtDNA.
