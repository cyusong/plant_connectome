Flowers are intricate and integrated three-dimensional (3D) structures predominantly studied in 2D due to the difficulty in quantitatively characterising their morphology in 3D. Given the recent development of analytical methods for high-dimensional data, the reconstruction of flower models in three dimensions represents the limiting factor to studying flowers in 3D. We developed a floral photogrammetry protocol to reconstruct 3D models of flowers based on images taken with a digital single-lens reflex camera, a turntable and a portable lightbox. We demonstrate that photogrammetry allows a rapid and accurate reconstruction of 3D models of flowers from 2D images. It can reconstruct all visible parts of flowers and has the advantage of keeping colour information. We illustrated its use by studying the shape and colour of 18 Gesneriaceae species. Photogrammetry is an affordable alternative to micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) that requires minimal investment and equipment, allowing it to be used directly in the field. It has the potential to stimulate research on the evolution and ecology of flowers by providing a simple way to access 3D morphological data from a variety of flower types.
