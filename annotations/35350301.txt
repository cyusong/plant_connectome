MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of endogenous, non-coding RNAs, which is 20-24 nucleotide long, regulate the expression of its target genes post-transcriptionally and play critical roles in plant normal growth, development, and biotic and abiotic stresses. In cells, miRNA biogenesis and stability control are important in regulating intracellular miRNA abundance. In addition, research on these two aspects has achieved fruitful results. In this review, we focus on the recent research progress in our understanding of miRNA biogenesis and their stability control in plants.
