['15342621', 'Cytokinins are plant hormones that can be glucosylated to form O-glucosides and  N-glucosides. The glycoconjugates are inactive and are thought to play a role in  homeostasis of the hormones. Although O-glucosyltransferases have been identified  that recognize cytokinins, the enzymes involved in N-glucosylation have not been  identified even though the process has been recognized for many years. This study  utilizes a screening strategy in which 105 recombinant glycosyltransferases  (UGTs) of Arabidopsis have been analyzed for catalytic activity toward the  classical cytokinins: trans-zeatin, dihydrozeatin, N(6)-benzyladenine,  N(6)-isopentenyladenine, and kinetin. Five UGTs were identified in the screen.  UGT76C1 and UGT76C2 recognized all cytokinins and glucosylated the hormones at  the N(7) and N(9) positions. UGT85A1, UGT73C5, and UGT73C1 recognized  trans-zeatin and dihydrozeatin, which have an available hydroxyl group for  glucosylation and formed the O-glucosides. The biochemical characteristics of the  N-glucosyltransferases were analyzed, and highly effective inhibitors of their  activities were identified. Constitutive overexpression of UGT76C1 in transgenic  Arabidopsis confirmed that the recombinant enzyme functioned in vivo to  glucosylate cytokinin applied to the plant. The role of the  N-glucosyltransferases in cytokinin metabolism is discussed.', '2004 Nov 12', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M409569200', 'Bowles']
