The ability of the freshwater alga, Chlorella kessleri, to maintain a carbon concentrating mechanism when grown at acid pH was investigated. The alga grows over the pH range 4.0-9.0 and was found to take up bicarbonate and CO2 actively when grown at pH 6.0. However, when grown at acid pH (below 5.5), it does not have active CO2 uptake. The acidotolerant species maintained an internal pH of 6.1-7.5 over the external pH range 4.5-7.5, thus the pH difference between the cell interior and the external medium was large enough to allow for the diffusive uptake of CO2 at acid external pH. Mass spectrometric monitoring of O2 and CO2 fluxes by suspensions of C. kessleri, grown at acid pH, and maintained at pH 7.5 showed that the rates of O2 evolution did not exceed those of CO2 uptake. The final CO2 compensation concentrations of 14.0-17.7 µM reached by photosynthetic cells were above the CO2 equilibrium concentration in the external medium, indicating a lack of active CO2 uptake at acid pH. Chlorella kessleri accumulated CO2 with internal concentrations that were 9.9, 18.7 and 22.7-fold that of the external medium for cells grown, respectively, at pH 4.5, 5.0 and 5.5. The ability of C. kessleri cells to accumulate high intracellular concentrations of inorganic carbon at acid pH would provide a sufficiently high concentration of CO2 at the active site of Rubisco thus allowing the alga to maintain growth rates similar to those at alkaline pH.
