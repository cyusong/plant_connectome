['10198637', 'The identities of the four floral organ types in an Arabidopsis flower are  specified by the combinatorial activities of the floral homeotic A, B, and C  function genes; AGAMOUS is the only known C function gene. We have identified two  genes that interact with AG in the specification of floral structure, HUA1 and  HUA2, from a screen for enhancers of a weak ag allele, ag-4. HUA1 and HUA2 are  involved in all aspects of AG function. HUA2 encodes a novel protein that  contains nuclear localization signals and signature motifs that suggest HUA2,  like AG, may be a transcription factor. Molecular analyses suggest that HUA2 (and  possibly HUA1) acts to facilitate AG action at the same hierarchical level as AG.', '1999 Mar', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/s1097-2765(00)80462-1', 'Meyerowitz']
