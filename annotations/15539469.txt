['15539469', 'Vacuoles play central roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses.  To better understand vacuole function and biogenesis we have characterized the  vegetative vacuolar proteome from Arabidopsis thaliana. Vacuoles were isolated  from protoplasts derived from rosette leaf tissue. Total purified vacuolar  proteins were then subjected either to multidimensional liquid  chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry or to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE coupled  with nano-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC MS/MS). To  ensure maximum coverage of the proteome, a tonoplast-enriched fraction was also  analyzed separately by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE followed by nano-LC MS/MS.  Cumulatively, 402 proteins were identified. The sensitivity of our analyses is  indicated by the high coverage of membrane proteins. Eleven of the twelve known  vacuolar-ATPase subunits were identified. Here, we present evidence of four  tonoplast-localized soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein  receptors (SNAREs), representing each of the four groups of SNARE proteins  necessary for membrane fusion. In addition, potential cargo of the N- and  C-terminal propeptide sorting pathways, association of the vacuole with the  cytoskeleton, and the vacuolar localization of 89 proteins of unknown function  are identified. A detailed analysis of these proteins and their roles in vacuole  function and biogenesis is presented.', '2004 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.027078', 'Raikhel']
