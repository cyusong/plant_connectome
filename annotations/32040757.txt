PSBR1 is a moso bamboo gene negatively regulated by brassinosteroid, which encodes a mitochondrial localized protein. Overexpression of PSBR1 leads to growth inhibition in various growth progresses in Arabidopsis. The young shoot of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) is known as one of the fastest growing plant organs. The roles of phytohormones in the fast-growth of bamboo shoot are not fully understood. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of growth-promoting steroid hormones that play important roles in cell elongation and division. While BR related genes are highly enriched in fast-growing internodes in moso bamboo, the functions of BR in the fast-growth process is not understood at the molecular level. Here, we identified a poaceae specific gene, PSBR1 (Poaceae specific and BR responsive gene 1) from the moso bamboo genome. PSBR1 was highly expressed in the stem and leaves of bamboo seedling, and the elongating nodes of fast-growing bamboo shoot. PSBR1's expression is increased by BR biosynthesis inhibitor propiconazole but decreased by BR treatment. PSBR1 encodes a novel protein that is localized to the mitochondria in tobacco and bamboo protoplast. The Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing PSBR1 show growth inhibition in both vegetative and reproductive stages. This study suggests that PSBR1 is a BR regulated mitochondrial protein in bamboo, which inhibits plant growth when overexpressed in Arabidopsis.
