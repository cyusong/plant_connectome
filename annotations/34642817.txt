Decreased accumulation of polyphenol oxidase, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, effective regulation of programmed cell death, and a protein predicted as allergenic can play key roles in cacao defense against Ceratocystis cacaofunesta. Ceratocystis wilt, caused by the fungus Ceratocystis cacaofunesta, has destroyed millions of Theobroma cacao trees in several countries of the Americas. Through proteomics, systems biology, and enzymatic analyses of infected stems, it was possible to infer mechanisms used by resistant (TSH1188) and susceptible (CCN51) cacao genotypes during infection. Protein extraction from xylem-enriched tissue of stems inoculated with the fungus and their controls 1 day after inoculation was carried out, followed by separation through two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identification by mass spectrometry. Enzyme activity was determined at 1, 3, 7 and 15 days after inoculation. A total of 50 differentially accumulated distinct proteins were identified in the treatments of both genotypes and were classified into 10 different categories. An interaction network between homologous proteins from Arabidospsis thaliana was generated for each genotype, using the STRING database and Cytoscape software. Primary metabolism processes were apparently repressed in both genotypes. The resistance factors suggested for genotype TSH1188 were: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, effective regulation of programmed cell death, production of phytoalexins derived from tryptophan and furanocoumarins, and participation of a predicted allergenic protein with probable ribonuclease function inhibiting the germination and propagation of the fungus. In the susceptible genotype, it is possible that its recognition and signaling mechanism through proteins from the SEC14 family is easily overcome by the pathogen. Our results will help to better understand the interaction between cacao and one of its most aggressive pathogens, to create disease control strategies.
