['14675453', 'In higher plants, pollen tubes and root hairs share an ancient growth process  named tip growth. We have isolated three allelic Arabidopsis mutant lines showing  kinky-shaped pollen tubes and, when homozygous, showing shorter and thicker root  hairs. The ultrastructure of pollen tubes in these kinky pollen (kip) mutants is  similar to that of the wild type; however, time-lapse studies suggest that  aberrant pollen tube shape is caused by periodic growth arrests alternated with  phases of tube axis reorientation. The KIP gene encodes a protein of 2587 amino  acids that is predicted to be targeted to the secretory pathway. KIP mRNA was  detected in all organs investigated but was most abundant in pollen and roots.  KIP has putative homologues in many eukaryotes, including mammals and yeast, and  is similar to the Arabidopsis SABRE gene, whose mutation causes a dwarf  phenotype. The phenotype of the kip/sab double mutant suggests related functions  for both genes, however, the KIP protein is mostly required for tip-growth.', '2003 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01933.x', 'Bonhomme']
