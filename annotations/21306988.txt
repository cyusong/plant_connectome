Jasmonates are plant signaling molecules that play key roles in protection against certain pathogens and against insects by switching on the expression of genes encoding defense proteins including enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of toxic secondary metabolites. In Catharanthus roseus, the ethylene response factor (ERF) transcription factor ORCA3 controls the jasmonate-responsive activation of terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthetic genes. ORCA3 gene expression is itself induced by jasmonate. Its promoter contains an autonomous jasmonate-responsive element (JRE). Here we describe the jasmonate-responsive activity of the JRE from the ORCA3 promoter in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that it interacts in vitro and in vivo with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor AtMYC2. Analysis of JRE-mediated reporter gene expression in an atmyc2-1 mutant background showed that the activity was strictly dependent on AtMYC2.
