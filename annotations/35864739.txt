The number and intensity of flood events will likely increase in the future, raising the risk of flooding stress in terrestrial plants. Understanding flood effects on plant physiology and plant-associated microbes is key to alleviate flooding stress in sensitive species and ecosystems. Reduced oxygen supply is the main constrain to the plant and its associated microbiome. Hypoxic conditions hamper root aerobic respiration and, consequently, hydraulic conductance, nutrient uptake, and plant growth and development. Hypoxia favours the presence of anaerobic microbes in the rhizosphere and roots with potential negative effects to the plant due to their pathogenic behaviour or their soil denitrification ability. Moreover, plant physiological and metabolic changes induced by flooding stress may also cause dysbiotic changes in endosphere and rhizosphere microbial composition. The negative effects of flooding stress on the holobiont (i.e., the host plant and its associated microbiome) can be mitigated once the plant displays adaptive responses to increase oxygen uptake. Stress relief could also arise from the positive effect of certain beneficial microbes, such as mycorrhiza or dark septate endophytes. More research is needed to explore the spiralling, feedback flood responses of plant and microbes if we want to promote plant flood tolerance from a holobiont perspective.
