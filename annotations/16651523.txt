['16651523', "Leaf stomata close in response to high carbon dioxide levels and open at low  CO(2). CO(2) concentrations in leaves are altered by daily dark/light cycles, as  well as the continuing rise in atmospheric CO(2). Relative to abscisic acid and  blue light signaling, little is known about the molecular, cellular, and genetic  mechanisms of CO(2) signaling in guard cells. Interestingly, we report that  repetitive Ca(2+) transients were observed during the stomatal opening stimulus,  low [CO(2)]. Furthermore, low/high [CO(2)] transitions modulated the cytosolic  Ca(2+) transient pattern in Arabidopsis guard cells (Landsberg erecta).  Inhibition of cytosolic Ca(2+) transients, achieved by loading guard cells with  the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and  not adding external Ca(2+), attenuated both high CO(2)-induced stomatal closing  and low CO(2)-induced stomatal opening, and also revealed a Ca(2+)-independent  phase of the CO(2) response. Furthermore, the mutant, growth controlled by  abscisic acid (gca2) shows impairment in [CO(2)] modulation of the cytosolic  Ca(2+) transient rate and strong impairment in high CO(2)-induced stomatal  closing. Our findings provide insights into guard cell CO(2) signaling  mechanisms, reveal Ca(2+)-independent events, and demonstrate that calcium  elevations can participate in opposed signaling events during stomatal opening  and closing. A model is proposed in which CO(2) concentrations prime Ca(2+)  sensors, which could mediate specificity in Ca(2+) signaling.", '2006 May 9', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0602225103', 'Schroeder']
