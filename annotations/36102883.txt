<i>Rhizoctonia cerealis</i> is a soilborne fungus that can cause sharp eyespot in wheat, resulting in massive yield losses found in many countries. Due to the lack of resistant cultivars, fungicides have been widely used to control this pathogen. However, chemical control is not environmentally friendly and is costly. Meanwhile, the lack of genetic transformation tools has hindered the functional characterization of virulence genes. In this study, we attempted to characterize the function of virulence genes by two transient methods, host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) and spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS), which use RNA interference to suppress the pathogenic development. We identified ten secretory orphan genes from the genome. After silencing these ten genes, only the <i>RcOSP1</i> knocked-down plant significantly inhibited the growth of <i>R. cerealis</i>. We then described RcOSP1 as an effector that could impair wheat biological processes and suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in the infection process. These findings confirm that HIGS and SIGS can be practical tools for researching <i>R. cerealis</i> virulence genes. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
