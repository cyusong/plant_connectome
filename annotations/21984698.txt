['21984698', "Autophagy is an intracellular recycling route in eukaryotes whereby organelles  and cytoplasm are sequestered in vesicles, which are subsequently delivered to  the vacuole for breakdown. The process is induced by various nutrient-responsive  signaling cascades converging on the Autophagy-Related1 (ATG1)/ATG13 kinase  complex. Here, we describe the ATG1/13 complex in Arabidopsis thaliana and show  that it is both a regulator and a target of autophagy. Plants missing ATG13 are  hypersensitive to nutrient limitations and senesce prematurely similar to mutants  lacking other components of the ATG system. Synthesis of the ATG12-ATG5 and  ATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine adducts, which are essential for autophagy, still  occurs in ATG13-deficient plants, but the biogenesis of ATG8-decorated autophagic  bodies does not, indicating that the complex regulates downstream events required  for autophagosome enclosure and/or vacuolar delivery. Surprisingly, levels of the  ATG1a and ATG13a phosphoproteins drop dramatically during nutrient starvation and  rise again upon nutrient addition. This turnover is abrogated by inhibition of  the ATG system, indicating that the ATG1/13 complex becomes a target of  autophagy. Consistent with this mechanism, ATG1a is delivered to the vacuole with  ATG8-decorated autophagic bodies. Given its responsiveness to nutrient demands,  the turnover of the ATG1/13 kinase likely provides a dynamic mechanism to tightly  connect autophagy to a plant's nutritional status.", '2011 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.090993', 'Vierstra']
