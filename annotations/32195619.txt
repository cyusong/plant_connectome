Cellular dynamics of KORRIGAN 1 (KOR1) is closely linked with cellulose biosynthesis and plant osmotic stress tolerance. Cycling of KOR1 between the plasma membrane (PM) and <i>trans</i>-Golgi Network (TGN) is maintained by sequence motifs and protein structures that are recognized by cellular transport and quality control mechanisms. Several mutations in KOR1, as well as in the host genetic background, promote the mistargeting of KOR1 and induce KOR1 accumulation in the tonoplast (TP). Yet, little is known about how retention and sorting of KOR1 are regulated in the PM-TGN cycle. Forward genetic screening for GFP-KOR1 mislocalizing phenotype resulted in several mutant lines with different localization patterns or signal intensity of GFP-KOR1. One of the identified mutants were disrupted at <i>UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase</i> (<i>UGGT</i>) locus, which is essential for the protein quality control in the ER. Our finding suggests the mis/unfolded structure of KOR1 triggers the TP targeting.
