IAN873, Dongfang93114 and Reyan73397, created through vegetative propagation for their high yield and excellent cold resistance, are major clones planted in China. In this work, latexes with rubber particles of the same size from these clones are separated from fresh natural rubber latex, and corresponding rubber films are prepared from each latex. The structure and components of each film are measured. This indicates that the characteristics of the rubbers obtained from latexes with similar particle sizes show some resembling trends among different clones, while for specific samples, those characteristics vary depending on the clone. The molecular weight is generally highest in IAN873 and lowest in Reyan73397. Rubber chains in small rubber particles are longer, and large rubber particles show a wider molecular weight distribution. The gel content of every sample from Reyan73397 is lower than the other two clones. The nitrogen content increases with the size of rubber particles in all clones. The ester content of small rubber particles in IAN873 and Reyan73397 is almost zero. Large rubber particles have more branching points formed via esters. This study provides a new perspective on the influence of clones on the relationship between characteristics of natural rubber and the size of rubber particles in natural rubber latex.
