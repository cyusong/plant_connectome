Seed germination plays a pivotal role in the plant life cycle, and its precise regulatory mechanisms are not clear. In this study, 19 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with rice seed germination were identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the following traits in 2016 and 2017: germination rate (GR) at 3, 5, and 7 days after imbibition (DAI) and germination index (GI). Two major stable QTLs, qSG4 and qSG11.1, were found to be associated with GR and GI over 2 continuous years. Furthermore, OsPK5, encoding a pyruvate kinase, was shown to be a crucial regulator of seed germination in rice, and might be a causal gene of the key QTL qSG11.1, on chromosome 11. Natural variation in OsPK5 function altered the activity of pyruvate kinase. The disruption of OsPK5 function resulted in slow germination and seedling growth during seed germination, blocked glycolytic metabolism, caused glucose accumulation, decreased energy levels, and affected the GA/ABA balance. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the roles of OsPK5 in seed germination, and facilitate its application in rice breeding to improve seed vigour.
