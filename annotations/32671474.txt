Low temperature decreases PSII damage in vivo, confirming earlier in vitro results. Susceptibility to photoinhibition differs among Arabidopsis accessions and moderately decreases after 2-week cold-treatment. Flavonols may alleviate photoinhibition. The rate of light-induced inactivation of photosystem II (PSII) at 22 and 4 °C was measured from natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana (Rschew, Tenela, Columbia-0, Coimbra) grown under optimal conditions (21 °C), and at 4 °C from plants shifted to 4 °C for 2 weeks. Measurements were done in the absence and presence of lincomycin (to block repair). PSII activity was assayed with the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameter F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> and with light-saturated rate of oxygen evolution using a quinone acceptor. When grown at 21 °C, Rschew was the most tolerant to photoinhibition and Coimbra the least. Damage to PSII, judged from fitting the decrease in oxygen evolution or F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> to a first-order equation, proceeded more slowly or equally at 4 than at 22 °C. The 2-week cold-treatment decreased photoinhibition at 4 °C consistently in Columbia-0 and Coimbra, whereas in Rschew and Tenela the results depended on the method used to assay photoinhibition. The rate of singlet oxygen production by isolated thylakoid membranes, measured with histidine, stayed the same or slightly decreased with decreasing temperature. On the other hand, measurements of singlet oxygen from leaves with Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green suggest that in vivo more singlet oxygen is produced at 4 °C. Under high light, the PSII electron acceptor Q<sub>A</sub> was more reduced at 4 than at 22 °C. Singlet oxygen production, in vitro or in vivo, did not decrease due to the cold-treatment. Epidermal flavonols increased during the cold-treatment and, in Columbia-0 and Coimbra, the amount correlated with photoinhibition tolerance.
