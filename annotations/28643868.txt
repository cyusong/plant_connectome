There, in source tissues where sufficient chemical energy (ATP) is available, K<sup>+</sup> is loaded into the phloem and then transported with the phloem stream to other parts of the plant; in part, transport is also back to the roots. This, at first sight, futile cycling of K<sup>+</sup> has been uncovered to be part of a sophisticated mechanism that (1) enables the shoot to communicate its nutrient demand to the root, (2) contributes to the K<sup>+</sup> nutrition of transport phloem tissues and (3) transports energy stored in the K<sup>+</sup> gradient between phloem cytosol and the apoplast. This potassium battery can be tapped by opening AKT2-like potassium channels and then enables the ATP-independent energization of other transport processes, such as the reloading of sucrose. Insights into these mechanisms have only been possible by combining wet-lab and dry-lab experiments by means of computational cell biology modeling and simulations.
