['23933465', 'The geraniol-derived (seco)iridoid skeleton is a precursor for a large group of  bioactive compounds with diverse therapeutic applications, including the widely  used anticancer molecule vinblastine. Despite of this economic prospect, the  pathway leading to iridoid biosynthesis from geraniol is still unclear. The first  geraniol hydroxylation step has been reported to be catalyzed by cytochrome P450  enzymes such as CYP76B6 from Catharanthus roseus and CYP76C1 from Arabidopsis  thaliana. In the present study, an extended functional analysis of CYP76 family  members was carried-out to identify the most effective enzyme to be used for  pathway reconstruction. This disproved CYP76C1 activity and led to the  characterization of CYP76C4 from A. thaliana as a geraniol 9- or 8-hydroxylase.  CYP76B6 emerged as a highly specialized multifunctional enzyme catalyzing two  sequential oxidation steps leading to the formation of 8-oxogeraniol from  geraniol. This dual function was confirmed in planta using a leaf-disc assay. The  first step, geraniol hydroxylation, was very efficient and fast enough to  outcompete geraniol conjugation in plant tissues. When the enzyme was expressed  in leaf tissues, 8-oxogeraniol was converted into further oxidized and/or reduced  compounds in the absence of the next enzyme of the iridoid pathway.', '2013 Nov', 'Metab Eng', '10.1016/j.ymben.2013.08.001', 'Werck-Reichhart']
