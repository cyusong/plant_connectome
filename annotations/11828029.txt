['11828029', 'We previously identified a novel class of proteins, named pseudo-response  regulators (APRRs) in Arabidopsis thaliana, each of which (APRR1, APRR3, APRR5,  APRR7, and APRR9) has an intriguing structural design containing an N-terminal  pseudo receiver domain and a C-terminal CONSTANS motif. Among them, APRR1 is  identical to TOC1, previously proposed to be a candidate component of an  Arabidopsis circadian clock. Intriguingly, expressions of the APRR1/TOC1 family  of genes are under control of coordinate circadian rhythms at the level of  transcription, in the manner that each APRR-transcript starts accumulating  sequentially after dawn with 2 to 3 h intervals in the order:  APRR9-->APRR7-->APRR5-->APRR3-->APRR1/TOC1. Here we examined this  circadian-related event, "circadian waves of the APRR1/TOC1 quintet", by  employing CCA1-overexpression (CCA1-ox) transgenic plants, based on the fact that  CCA1 is a well-characterized and the most plausible oscillator component. It was  found that aberrant overexpression of the CCA1 gene severely perturbed  free-running and sequential rhythms of the APRR1/TOC1 family of genes. In the  accompanying paper, it was shown that overexpression of APRR1 also results in a  marked alteration of the CCA1 circadian rhythm, and vice versa. Taken together,  it was suggested that there are intimate and mutual links between these two types  of circadian-associated components (APRRs and CCA1).', '2002 Jan', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcf006', 'Mizuno']
