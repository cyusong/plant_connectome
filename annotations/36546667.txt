Plants produce a large range of structurally varied low molecular weight secondary metabolites, which evaporate, known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Several of them are emitted in response to biotic stress as a defensive measure against pathogen attacks. Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMFs) can change the VOC pattern in parts of the plant and may promote plant defense via direct or indirect mechanisms. Mycorrhization of plants positively affects plant immunization along with growth and yield. The presence of AMF may raise the concentration of phenolic compounds and the activity of critical defense-related enzymes. AMF-induced changes in plant chemistry and associated volatile emissions lead to stronger immunity against pathogenic microorganisms. Despite substantial research into the origins of diversity in VOC-mediated plant communication, very little is known about the mechanism of influence of several AMFs on plant VOC emissions and modulation of plant immunization. Moreover, the molecular mechanism for VOC sensing in plants and mycorrhizal association is still unclear. In the present review, we have presented an up-to-date understanding of the cross-talk of AMF and VOC patterns in plants and the subsequent modulation of resistance against microbial pathogens.
