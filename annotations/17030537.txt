Very little is known about the primary carbon metabolism of the high mountain plant Ranunculus glacialis. It is a species with C3 photosynthesis, but with exceptionally high malate content in its leaves, the biological significance of which remains unclear. 13C/12C-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) labelling were used to study the carbon metabolism of R. glacialis, paying special attention to respiration. Although leaf dark respiration was high, the temperature response had a Q10 of 2, and the respiratory quotient (CO2 produced divided by O2 consumed) was nearly 1, indicating that the respiratory pool is comprised of carbohydrates. Malate, which may be a large carbon substrate, was not respired. However, when CO2 fixed by photosynthesis was labelled, little labelling of the CO2 subsequently respired in the dark was detected, indicating that: (i) most of the carbon recently assimilated during photosynthesis is not respired in the dark; and (ii) the carbon used for respiration originates from (unlabelled) reserves. This is the first demonstration of such a low metabolic coupling of assimilated and respired carbon in leaves. The biological significance of the uncoupling between assimilation and respiration is discussed.
