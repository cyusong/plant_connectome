['22319055', 'Flowering of Arabidopsis thaliana is induced by exposure to long days (LDs).  During this process, the shoot apical meristem is converted to an inflorescence  meristem that forms flowers, and this transition is maintained even if plants are  returned to short days (SDs). We show that exposure to five LDs is sufficient to  commit the meristem of SD-grown plants to flower as if they were exposed to  continuous LDs. The MADS box proteins SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1  (SOC1) and FRUITFULL (FUL) play essential roles in this commitment process and in  the induction of flowering downstream of the transmissible FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)  signal. We exploited laser microdissection and Solexa sequencing to identify 202  genes whose transcripts increase in the meristem during floral commitment.  Expression of six of these transcripts was tested in different mutants, allowing  them to be assigned to FT-dependent or FT-independent pathways. Most, but not  all, of those dependent on FT and its paralog TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) also relied  on SOC1 and FUL. However, this dependency on FT and TSF or SOC1 and FUL was often  bypassed in the presence of the short vegetative phase mutation. FLOR1, which  encodes a leucine-rich repeat protein, was induced in the early inflorescence  meristem, and flor1 mutations delayed flowering. Our data contribute to the  definition of LD-dependent pathways downstream and in parallel to FT.', '2012 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.092791', 'Coupland']
