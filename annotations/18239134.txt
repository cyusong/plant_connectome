['18239134', 'The Ypt3/Rab11/Rab25 subfamily of Rab GTPases has expanded greatly in Arabidopsis  thaliana, comprising 26 members in six provisional subclasses, Rab-A1 to Rab-A6.  We show that the Rab-A2 and Rab-A3 subclasses define a novel post-Golgi membrane  domain in Arabidopsis root tips. The Rab-A2/A3 compartment was distinct from but  often close to Golgi stacks and prevacuolar compartments and partly overlapped  the VHA-a1 trans-Golgi compartment. It was also sensitive to brefeldin A and  accumulated FM4-64 before prevacuolar compartments did. Mutations in RAB-A2a that  were predicted to stabilize the GDP- or GTP-bound state shifted the location of  the protein to the Golgi or plasma membrane, respectively. In mitosis, KNOLLE  accumulated principally in the Rab-A2/A3 compartment. During cytokinesis, Rab-A2  and Rab-A3 proteins localized precisely to the growing margins of the cell plate,  but VHA-a1, GNOM, and prevacuolar markers were excluded. Inducible expression of  dominant-inhibitory mutants of RAB-A2a resulted in enlarged, polynucleate,  meristematic cells with cell wall stubs. The Rab-A2/A3 compartment, therefore, is  a trans-Golgi compartment that communicates with the plasma membrane and early  endosomal system and contributes substantially to the cell plate. Despite the  unique features of plant cytokinesis, membrane traffic to the division plane  exhibits surprising molecular similarity across eukaryotic kingdoms in its  reliance on Ypt3/Rab11/Rab-A GTPases.', '2008 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.052001', 'Moore']
