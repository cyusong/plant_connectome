MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control many aspects of development and adaption in plants and in animals by post-transcriptional control of mRNA stability and translatability. Over the last years numerous proteins have been identified in the miRNA pathway. The versatile scaffold protein RACK1 has been associated with efficient miRNA production and function in plants and metazoans. Here, we briefly summarize the differences of RACK1 function in the plant and animal miRNA pathways and discuss putative mechanisms and functional roles of RACK1 in miRNA biogenesis and action.

RACK1: !controls! miRNA production 
RACK1: !regulates! miRNA action 
miRNAs: !affect! development and adaption 
miRNAs: !stabilize! mRNA
