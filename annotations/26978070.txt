['26978070', 'Although multiple lines of evidence have indicated that Arabidopsis thaliana  Tandem CCCH Zinc Finger proteins, AtTZF4, 5 and 6 are involved in ABA, GA and  phytochrome mediated seed germination responses, the interacting proteins  involved in these processes are unknown. Using yeast two-hybrid screens, we have  identified 35 putative AtTZF5 interacting protein partners. Among them, Mediator  of ABA-Regulated Dormancy 1 (MARD1) is highly expressed in seeds and involved in  ABA signal transduction, while Responsive to Dehydration 21A (RD21A) is a  well-documented stress responsive protein. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and  bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays were used to confirm that  AtTZF5 can interact with MARD1 and RD21A in plant cells, and the interaction is  mediated through TZF motif. In addition, AtTZF4 and 6 could also interact with  MARD1 and RD21A in Y-2-H and BiFC assay, respectively. The protein-protein  interactions apparently take place in processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules  (SGs), because AtTZF5, MARD1 and RD21A could interact and co-localize with each  other and they all can co-localize with the same PB and SG markers in plant  cells.', '2016', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0151574', 'Jang']
