Reactive oxygen species (ROS) behave as signaling molecules and induce biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites, including apocarotenoids, which play critical roles in stress tolerance through radical scavenging. However, the mechanism that regulates ROS responsive apocarotenoid metabolism and subsequent stress response is unknown. In this study, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor (CstMYB14) was identified from Crocus sativus L., which acts as a regulator of apocarotenoid biosynthesis. CstMYB14 expression increases in response to H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> in a concentration and time-dependent manner. CstMYB14 localizes to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator. Over-expression of CstMYB14 in Crocus stigmas enhanced apocarotenoid biosynthesis. Yeast-one-hybrid demonstrated binding of CstMYB14 to promoters of two apocarotenoid pathway genes (phytoene synthase and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 2). Nicotiana benthamiana plants overexpressing CstMYB14 showed better growth and higher stress tolerance than wild type plants. Higher antioxidant activity in CstMYB14-Ox plants indicated that stress tolerance might be due to ROS scavenging. These results establish a molecular link between ROS signaling, apocarotenoid metabolism and stress tolerance. Further, CstMYB14 is shown to act as a key regulator which modulates ROS responsive biosynthesis of apocarotenoids which in turn impart stress tolerance through ROS scavenging.
