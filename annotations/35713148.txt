C-repeat binding factor (CBF) subfamily genes encoding transcriptional activators are members of the AP2/ERF superfamily. CBFs play important roles in plant tolerance to abiotic stress. In this study, we identified and analyzed the structure, phylogeny, conserved motifs, and expression profiles of 12 CBFs of the grass species <i>Lolium perenne</i> cultured under abiotic stress. The identified LpCBFs were grouped into three phylogenetic clades according to their protein structures and motif organizations. <i>LpCBF</i> expression was differentially induced by cold, heat, water deficit, salinity, and abscisic acid, among which cold treatment induced <i>LpCBF</i> gene expression significantly. Furthermore, association network analysis indicated that different proteins, including certain stress-related proteins, potentially interact with LpCBFs. Altogether, these findings will enhance our understanding of LpCBFs protein structure and function in the regulation of <i>L. perenne</i> stress responses. Our results will provide valuable information for further functional research of LpCBF proteins in <i>L. perenne</i> stress resistance.
