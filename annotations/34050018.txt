In keeping with the directive in Executive Order 13874 (Modernizing the Regulatory Framework for Agricultural Biotechnology Products) to adopt regulatory approaches that are proportionate to risk and avoid arbitrary distinctions across like products, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) revised its biotechnology regulations by promulgating the Sustainable, Ecological, Consistent, Uniform, Responsible, and Efficient (SECURE) rule. Specifically, the SECURE rule 1) establishes exemptions for plants modified by genetic engineering where the modification could otherwise have been made through conventional breeding, 2) uses risk posed by the introduced trait to determine whether an organism is regulated, rather than relying on whether the organism was developed using a plant pest, and 3) provides a mechanism for a rapid initial review to efficiently distinguish plants developed using genetic engineering that do not pose plausible pathways to increased plant pest risk from those that do. As a result of the focused oversight on potentially riskier crops developed using genetic engineering, USDA is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its oversight program. The reduced regulatory burden is expected to promote innovation by expanding the number and diversity of developers to include smaller businesses and academics and to increase the number and variety of traits being developed through biotechnology.
