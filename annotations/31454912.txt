<i>Fusarium langsethiae</i> is amongst the most recently discovered pathogens of small grains cereals. <i>F. langsethiae</i> is the main producer, in Europe, of T2 and HT-toxins in small grain cereals, albeit often asymptomatic; this makes its control challenging. The European Union (EU) is pushing hard on the use of biocontrol agents to minimize the use of fungicides and pesticides, which are detrimental to the environment and responsible for serious pollution of the soil and superficial water. In line with EU directives (e.g., 128/2009), here we report the use of protein fractions, purified from the culture filtrate of the basidiomycete <i>Trametes versicolor</i>, for controlling <i>F. langsethiae</i>. <i>T. versicolor</i>, a so-called medicinal mushroom which is applied as a co-adjuvant in oncology and other pathologies as a producer of biological response modifiers. In this study, the exo-proteome of <i>T. versicolor</i> proved highly efficient in inhibiting the growth of <i>F. langsethiae</i> and the biosynthesis of the T2 toxin. Results are promising for its future use as a sustainable product to control <i>F. langsethiae</i> infection in cereals under field conditions.
