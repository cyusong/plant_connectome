['27803060', 'The root cap supports root growth by protecting the root meristem, sensing  gravity and interacting with the rhizosphere through metabolite secretion and  cell dispersal. Sustained root cap functions therefore rely on balanced  proliferation of proximal stem cells and regulated detachment of distal mature  cells. Although the gene regulatory network that governs stem cell activity in  the root cap has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis, the mechanisms by which  root cap cells mature and detach from the root tip are poorly understood. We  performed a detailed expression analysis of three regulators of root cap  differentiation, SOMBRERO, BEARSKIN1 and BEARSKIN2, and identified their  downstream genes. Our results indicate that expression of BEARSKIN1 and BEARSKIN2  is associated with cell positioning on the root surface. We identified a glycosyl  hydrolase 28 (GH28) family polygalacturonase (PG) gene as a direct target of  BEARSKIN1. Overexpression and loss-of-function analyses demonstrated that the  protein encoded by this PG gene facilitates cell detachment. We thus revealed a  molecular link between the key regulators of root cap differentiation and the  cellular events underlying root cap-specific functions.', '2016 Nov 1', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.142331', 'ORCID:']
