The WRKY proteins belong to a superfamily of TFs that play pivotal roles in responses to a wide range of biotic, abiotic, developmental and physiologic cues. Here, we assayed the accumulation of basal WRKY27 transcripts in diverse tissue including root, shoot, leaf and flowers. We demonstrated that plants over-expressing WRKY27 transcript levels exhibit growth aberrations and fertility defects. Scanning electron microscopic data suggest that WRKY27 overexpressor plants exhibit pollen dehiscence defects. Our fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis assay showed that flowers of plants overexpressing WRKY27 display significantly decreased pollen viability. These sterility-related phenotypes were not rescued by the exogenous applications of different phytohormones. Our results indicate the involvement of WRKY27 in particular for proper plant biomass accumulation and male fertility.
