Proline (Pro) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) play a critical role in plants during drought adaptation. Genetic mapping for drought-induced Pro and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production under field conditions is very limited in crop plants since their phenotyping with large populations is labor-intensive. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a diversity panel comprised of 184 bread wheat cultivars grown in natural field (control) and rain-out shelter (drought) environments was performed to identify candidate loci and genes regulating Pro and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation induced by drought. The GWAS identified top significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) on 1A and 2A chromosomes, respectively for Pro and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in response to drought. Similarly, MTAs for stress tolerance index (STI) of Pro and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were identified on 5B and 1B chromosomes, respectively. Total 143 significant MTAs were identified including 36 and 71 were linked to drought and 2 and 34 were linked to STI for Pro and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> respectively. Next, linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed minor alleles of significant single-markers and haplotypes were associated with higher Pro and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation under drought. Several putative candidate genes for Pro and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content encode proteins with kinase, transporter or protein-binding activities. The identified genetic factors associated with Pro and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> biosynthesis underlying drought adaptation lay a fundamental basis for functional studies and future marker-assisted breeding programs.
