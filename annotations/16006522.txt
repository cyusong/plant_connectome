['16006522', 'In higher plants, the circadian clock orchestrates fundamental processes such as  light signaling and the transition to flowering. We isolated mutants of the  circadian clock from an Arabidopsis thaliana mutagenized reporter line by  screening for seedlings with long hypocotyl phenotypes and subsequently assaying  for abnormal clock-regulated CAB2::LUC expression. This screen identified five  mutant alleles of a clock gene, LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX), that significantly affect  amplitude and robustness of rhythms in both constant white light and dark  conditions. In addition, the transition from vegetative to floral development is  accelerated and hypocotyl elongation is accentuated in these mutants under  light:dark cycles. We genetically mapped the mutations by bulk segregant analysis  with high-density oligonucleotide array genotyping to a small putative Myb  transcription factor related to other clock components and response regulators in  Arabidopsis. The negative arm of the Arabidopsis circadian clock, CIRCADIAN CLOCK  ASSOCIATED (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), is repressed in the lux  mutants, whereas TIMING OF CAB2 EXPRESSION (TOC1) is activated. We demonstrate  that CCA1 and LHY bind to the evening element motif in the LUX promoter, which  strongly suggests that these proteins repress LUX expression, as they do TOC1.  The data are also consistent with LUX being necessary for activation of CCA1 and  LHY expression.', '2005 Jul 19', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0503029102', 'Kay']
