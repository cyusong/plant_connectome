The genomes of many plant viruses have a coding capacity limited to <10 proteins, yet it is becoming increasingly clear that individual plant virus proteins may interact with several targets in the host for establishment of infection. As new functions are uncovered for individual viral proteins, virologists have realized that the apparent simplicity of the virus genome is an illusion that belies the true impact that plant viruses have on host physiology. In this review, we discuss our evolving understanding of the function of the P6 protein of Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), a process that was initiated nearly 35 years ago when the CaMV P6 protein was first described as the 'major inclusion body protein' (IB) present in infected plants. P6 is now referred to in most articles as the transactivator (TAV)/viroplasmin protein, because the first viral function to be characterized for the Caulimovirus P6 protein beyond its role as an inclusion body protein (the viroplasmin) was its role in translational transactivation (the TAV function). This review will discuss the currently accepted functions for P6 and then present the evidence for an entirely new function for P6 in intracellular movement.
