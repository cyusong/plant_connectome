['11331607', 'To control organ shape, plant cells expand differentially. The organization of  the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall is a key determinant of differential  expansion. Mutations in the COBRA (COB) gene of Arabidopsis, known to affect the  orientation of cell expansion in the root, are reported here to reduce the amount  of crystalline cellulose in cell walls in the root growth zone. The COB gene,  identified by map-based cloning, contains a sequence motif found in proteins that  are anchored to the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane through a  glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. In animal cells, this lipid linkage  is known to confer polar localization to proteins. The COB protein was detected  predominately on the longitudinal sides of root cells in the zone of rapid  elongation. Moreover, COB RNA levels are dramatically upregulated in cells  entering the zone of rapid elongation. Based on these results, models are  proposed for the role of COB as a regulator of oriented cell expansion.', '2001 May 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.879101', 'Benfey']
