['22879396', 'In plants, fatty acids (FAs) and FA-derived complex lipids are major carbon and  energy reserves in seeds. They are essential components of cellular membranes and  cellular signal or hormone molecules. Although TRANSPARENT TESTA2 (TT2) is well  studied for its function in regulating proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in the seed  coat, little attention has been given to its role in affecting seed FA  accumulation and tolerance to environmental stresses. We demonstrate that the tt2  mutation remarkably increased the seed FA content, decreased seed weight, and  altered the FA composition. The increase in FA content in the tt2 seeds was due  to the relative decrease of seed coat proportion as well as the more efficient FA  synthesis in the tt2 embryo. Microarray analysis revealed that tt2 mutation  up-regulated a group of genes critical to FA biosynthesis and embryonic  development. The mutation also altered the gene expressions that respond to  stress. The microarray analysis discovered that the increase in FA accumulation  of the tt2 seeds were accompanied by the significant up-regulation of FUSCA3, a  transcriptional factor for embryonic development and FATTY ACID ELONGASE1, which  catalyzes the elongation of FA chains. Moreover, lower seed protein accumulation  during seed maturation also contributed to the increased seed FA accumulation in  tt2 mutants. This study advances the understanding of the TT2 gene in seed FA  accumulation and abiotic stresses during seed germination and seedling  establishment.', '2012 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.202945', 'Jiang']
