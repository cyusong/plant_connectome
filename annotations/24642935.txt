Glycerolipid metabolism of plants responds dynamically to changes in light intensity and temperature, leading to the modification of membrane lipid composition to ensure optimal biochemical and physical properties in the new environment. Although multiple posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms have been reported to be involved in the process, the contribution of transcriptional regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we present an integrative analysis of transcriptomic and lipidomic data, revealing large-scale coordination between gene expression and changes in glycerolipid levels during the Arabidopsis thaliana response to light and temperature stimuli. Using a multivariate regression technique called O2PLS, we show that the gene expression response is strictly coordinated at the biochemical pathway level and occurs in parallel with changes of specific glycerolipid pools. Five interesting candidate genes were chosen for further analysis from a larger set of candidates identified based on their close association with various groups of glycerolipids. Lipidomic analysis of knockout mutant lines of these five genes showed a significant relationship between the coordination of transcripts and glycerolipid levels in a changing environment and the effects of single gene perturbations.
