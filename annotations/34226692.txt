Photosystem II (PSII) is a multisubunit pigment-protein complex and catalyses light-induced water oxidation, leading to the conversion of light energy into chemical energy and the release of dioxygen. We analysed the structures of two Psb28-bound PSII intermediates, Psb28-RC47 and Psb28-PSII, purified from a psbV-deletion strain of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, using cryo-electron microscopy. Both Psb28-RC47 and Psb28-PSII bind one Psb28, one Tsl0063 and an unknown subunit. Psb28 is located at the cytoplasmic surface of PSII and interacts with D1, D2 and CP47, whereas Tsl0063 is a transmembrane subunit and binds at the side of CP47/PsbH. Substantial structural perturbations are observed at the acceptor side, which result in conformational changes of the quinone (Q<sub>B</sub>) and non-haem iron binding sites and thus may protect PSII from photodamage during assembly. These results provide a solid structural basis for understanding the assembly process of native PSII.
