Bacterial wilt caused by <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> is an important disease of pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>), an economically important solanaceous vegetable worldwide, in particular, under high temperature (HT) conditions. However, the molecular mechanism underlying pepper immunity against bacterial wilt remains poorly understood. Herein, CaCBL1, a putative calcineurin B-like protein, was functionally characterized in the pepper response to <i>R. solanacearum</i> inoculation (RSI) under HT (RSI/HT). <i>CaCBL1</i> was significantly upregulated by RSI at room temperature (RSI/RT), HT, or RSI/HT. CaCBL1-GFP fused protein targeted to whole epidermal cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> when transiently overexpressed. <i>CaCBL1</i> silencing by virus-induced gene silencing significantly enhanced pepper susceptibility to RSI under RT or HT, while its transient overexpression triggered hypersensitive response mimic cell death and upregulation of immunity-associated marker genes, including <i>CabZIP63</i>, <i>CaWRKY40</i>, and <i>CaCDPK15</i>, the positive regulators in the pepper response to RSI or HT found in our previous studies. In addition, by chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, <i>CaCBL1</i> was found to be directly targeted by CaWRKY40, although not by CaWRKY27 or CaWRKY58, via the W-box-2 within its promoter, and its transcription was found to be downregulated by silencing of <i>CaWRKY40</i> while it was enhanced by its transient overexpression. These results suggest that CaCBL1 acts as a positive regulator in pepper immunity against <i>R. solanacearum</i> infection, constituting a positive feedback loop with <i>CaWRKY40</i>.
