In China, nitrogen (N) fertilizer is excessively used in sugarcane planting areas, while the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of sugarcane is relatively low. Mining and identifying the key genes in response to low N stress in sugarcane can provide useful gene elements and a theoretical basis for developing sugarcane varieties with high NUE. In our study, RNA-Seq combined with qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the <i>ScAMT1.1</i> gene responded positively to low N stress, resulting in the stronger low N tolerance and high NUE ability of sugarcane cultivar ROC22. Then, <i>ScAMT1.1</i> was cloned from sugarcane. The full-length cDNA of the <i>ScAMT1.1</i> gene is 1868 bp, containing a 1491 bp open reading frame (ORF), and encoding 496 amino acids. ScAMT1.1 belongs to the AMT superfamily and shares 91.57% homologies with AMT1.1 from <i>Oryza sativa</i>. Furthermore, it was stably overexpressed in rice (<i>O. sativa</i>). Under low N treatment, the plant height and the fresh weight of the <i>ScAMT1.1</i>-overexpressed transgenic rice were 36.48% and 51.55% higher than that of the wild-type, respectively. Both the activity of ammonium assimilation key enzymes GS and GDH, and the expression level of ammonium assimilation key genes, including <i>GS1.1</i>, <i>GS1.2</i>, <i>GDH</i>, <i>Fd-GOGAT</i>, and <i>NADH-GOGAT2</i> in the transgenic plants, were significantly higher than that of the wild-type. The grain number and grain yield per plant in the transgenic rice were 6.44% and 9.52% higher than that of the wild-type in the pot experiments, respectively. Taken together, the sugarcane <i>ScAMT1.1</i> gene has the potential to improve ammonium assimilation ability and the yield of transgenic rice under low N fertilizer conditions. This study provided an important functional gene for improving sugarcane varieties with high NUE.
