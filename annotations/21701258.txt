Arabidopsis mutant hps1 that over-accumulates sucrose has enhanced sensitivity in almost all the aspects of plant responses to phosphate starvation. The detailed characterization of hps1 has led to the conclusion that sucrose is a global regulator of plant phosphate responses. Here, we show that hps1 is also hypersensitive to nitrogen and potassium deprivation, as well as to decreased levels of overall macronutrients. These results suggest that sucrose regulates plant deficiency responses to multiple nutrients and is part of a general response to nutrient deprivation.

sucrose: !regulates! plant phosphate responses
sucrose: !regulates! plant deficiency responses to multiple nutrients
hps1: !over-accumulates! sucrose
hps1: !has enhanced sensitivity! to nitrogen and potassium deprivation
