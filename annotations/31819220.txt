Plants are able to sense a rise in temperature of several degrees, and appropriately adapt their metabolic and growth processes. To this end, plants produce various signalling molecules that act throughout the plant body. Here, we report that root-derived GA<sub>12</sub>, a precursor of the bioactive gibberellins, mediates thermo-responsive shoot growth in Arabidopsis. Our data suggest that root-to-shoot translocation of GA<sub>12</sub> enables a flexible growth response to ambient temperature changes.
