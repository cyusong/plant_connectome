['30834637', 'Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a highly conserved reversible enzyme that  participates in both glycolysis and photosynthesis. In Arabidopsis thaliana, one  cytosolic PGK (PGKc) and two plastidial PGKs (PGKp) are known. It remains  debatable whether the two PGKp isozymes are functionally redundant or specialized  in plastidial carbon metabolism and fixation. Here, using a pooled clustered  regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated  protein 9 (Cas9) strategy, we found that plants with single mutations in pgkp1 or  pgkp2 were not significantly affected, whereas a pgkp1pgkp2 double mutation was  lethal due to retarded carbon fixation, suggesting that PGKp isozymes play  redundant functional roles. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that the  sugar-deficient pgkp1pgkp2 double mutation was partially complemented by  exogenous sugar, although respiration intermediates were not rescued. Chloroplast  development was defective in pgkp1pgkp2, due to a deficiency in  glycolysis-dependent galactoglycerolipid biosynthesis. Ectopic expression of a  plastid targeting PGKc did not reverse the pgkp1pgkp2 double-mutant phenotypes.  Therefore, PGKp1 and PGKp2 play redundant roles in carbon fixation and  metabolism, whereas the molecular function of PGKc is more divergent. Our study  demonstrated the functional conservation and divergence of glycolytic enzymes.', '2019 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14303', 'ORCID:']
