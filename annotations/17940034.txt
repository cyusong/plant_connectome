['17940034', 'The biogenesis of thylakoid membranes, an indispensable event for the  photoautotrophic growth of plants, requires a significant increase in the level  of the unique thylakoid membrane lipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), which  constitutes the bulk of membrane lipids in chloroplasts. The final step in MGDG  biosynthesis occurs in the plastid envelope and is catalyzed by MGDG synthase.  Here we report the identification and characterization of an Arabidopsis mutant  showing a complete defect in MGDG synthase 1. The mutant seeds germinated as  small albinos only in the presence of sucrose. The seedlings lacked galactolipids  and had disrupted photosynthetic membranes, leading to the complete impairment of  photosynthetic ability and photoautotrophic growth. Moreover, invagination of the  inner envelope, which is not seen in mature WT chloroplasts, was observed in the  mutant, supporting an old hypothesis that envelope invagination is a major event  in early chloroplast biogenesis. In addition to the defective seedling phenotype,  embryo development was arrested in the mutant, although seeds with impaired  embryos could germinate heterotrophically. These results demonstrate the  importance of galactolipids not only in photosynthetic growth but also in  embryogenesis.', '2007 Oct 23', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0704680104', 'Ohta']
