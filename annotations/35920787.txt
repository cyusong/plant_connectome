['35920787', 'Light is a key environmental signal that regulates plant growth and development.  While posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms of gene expression include  alternative splicing (AS) of pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) in both plants and animals,  how light signaling affects AS in plants is largely unknown. Here, we identify  DExD/H RNA helicase U2AF65-associated protein (UAP56) as a negative regulator of  photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. UAP56 is encoded by the homologs  UAP56a and UAP56b. Knockdown of UAP56 led to enhanced photomorphogenic responses  and diverse developmental defects during vegetative and reproductive growth.  UAP56 physically interacts with the central light signaling repressor  constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) and U2AF65. Global transcriptome analysis  revealed that UAP56 and COP1 co-regulate the transcription of a subset of genes.  Furthermore, deep RNA-sequencing analysis showed that UAP56 and COP1 control  pre-mRNA AS in both overlapping and distinct manners. Ribonucleic acid  immunoprecipitation assays showed that UAP56 and COP1 bind to common small  nuclear RNAs and mRNAs of downstream targets. Our study reveals that both UAP56  and COP1 function as splicing factors that coordinately regulate AS during  light-regulated plant growth and development.', '2022 Oct 27', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koac235', 'ORCID:']
