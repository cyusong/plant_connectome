['19825600', 'Rho family small GTPases are universal signaling switches in the control of cell  polarity in eukaryotic cells. Their polar distribution to the cell cortex is  critical for the execution of their functions, yet the mechanism for this  distribution is poorly understood. Using a yeast two-hybrid method, we identified  RIP1 (ROP interactive partner 1), which belongs to a family of five members of  novel proteins that share a C-terminal region that interacts with ROP. When  expressed in Arabidopsis pollen, green fluorescence protein GFP-tagged RIP1 was  localized to the nucleus of mature pollen. When pollen grains were hydrated in  germination medium, GFP-RIP1 switched from the nucleus to the cell cortex at the  future pollen germination site and was maintained in the apical cortex of  germinating pollen and growing pollen tubes. RIP1 was found to interact with ROP1  in pollen tubes, and the cortical RIP1 localization was influenced by the  activity of ROP1. Overexpression of RIP1 induced growth depolarization in pollen  tubes, a phenotype similar to that induced by ROP1 overexpression. Interestingly,  RIP1 overexpression enhanced GFP-ROP1 recruitment to the plasma membrane (PM) of  pollen tubes. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that RIP1 is involved  in the positive feedback regulation of ROP1 localization to the PM, leading to  the establishment of a polar site for pollen germination and pollen tube growth.', '2008 Nov', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssn051', 'Yang']
