Plant architecture is a key determinant of crop productivity and adaptation. The highly conserved microRNA319 (miR319) family functions in various biological processes, but little is known about how miR319 regulates plant architecture in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Here, we determined that the miR319/TaGAMYB3 module controls plant architecture and grain yield in common wheat. Repressing tae-miR319 using short tandem target mimics resulted in favorable plant architecture traits, including increased plant height, reduced tiller number, enlarged spikes and flag leaves, and thicker culms, as well as enhanced grain yield in field plot tests. Overexpressing tae-miR319 had the opposite effects on plant architecture and grain yield. Although both TaPCF8 and TaGAMYB3 were identified as miR319 target genes, genetic complementation assays demonstrated that only miR319-resistant TaGAMYB3 (rTaGAMYB3) abolished tae-miR319-mediated growth inhibition of flag leaves and spikes. TaGAMYB3 functions as a transcriptional activator of downstream genes, including TaPSKR1, TaXTH23, TaMADS5 and TaMADS51, by binding to their promoters. Furthermore, TaGAMYB3 physically interacts with TaBA1, an important regulator of spike development, to additively activate the transcription of downstream genes such as TaMADS5. Our findings provide insight into how the miR319/TaGAMYB3 module regulates plant architecture and improves grain yield in common wheat.
