Single-cell sequencing approaches reveal the intracellular dynamics of individual cells and answer biological questions with high-dimensional catalogs of millions of cells, including genomics, transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, epigenomics, and proteomics data across species. These emerging yet thriving technologies have been fully embraced by the field of plant biology, with a constantly expanding portfolio of applications. Here, we introduce the current technical advances used for single-cell omics, especially single-cell genome and transcriptome sequencing. Firstly, we overview methods for protoplast and nucleus isolation and genome and transcriptome amplification. Subsequently, we use well-executed benchmarking studies to highlight advances made through the application of single-cell omics techniques. Looking forward, we offer a glimpse of additional hurdles and future opportunities that will introduce broad adoption of single-cell sequencing with revolutionary perspectives in plant biology.
