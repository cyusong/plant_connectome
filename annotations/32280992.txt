Although a growing number of mechanosensitive ion channels are being identified in plant systems, the molecular mechanisms by which they function are still under investigation. Overexpression of the mechanosensitive ion channel MSL (MscS-Like)10 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) triggers a number of developmental and cellular phenotypes including the induction of cell death, and this function is influenced by seven phosphorylation sites in its soluble N-terminus. Here, we show that these and other phenotypes required neither overexpression nor a tag, and could also be induced by a previously identified point mutation in the soluble C-terminus (S640L). The promotion of cell death and hyperaccumulation of H2O2 in 35S:MSL10S640L-GFP overexpression lines was suppressed by N-terminal phosphomimetic substitutions, and the soluble N- and C-terminal domains of MSL10 physically interacted. We propose a three-step model by which tension-induced conformational changes in the C-terminus could be transmitted to the N-terminus, leading to its dephosphorylation and the induction of adaptive responses. Taken together, this work expands our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction in plants.
