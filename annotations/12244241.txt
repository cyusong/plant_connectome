['12244241', 'A seed shape mutant of Arabidopsis was isolated from an ethyl  methanesulfonate-treated population. Genetic analysis revealed that the  heart-shaped phenotype was maternally inherited, showing that this is a testa  mutant. This indicated the importance of the testa for the determination of the  seed shape. This recessive aberrant testa shape (ats) gene was located at  position 59.0 on chromosome 5. A comparison was made between ovules and  developing and mature seeds of the wild type and of the mutant using light and  scanning electron microscopy. We showed that the mutant seed shape is determined  during the first few days after fertilization, when the embryo occupies only a  very small part of the seed. The integuments of ats ovules consisted of only  three rather than five cell layers. In double mutants, the effect of ats was  additive to other testa mutations, such as transparent testa, glabra (ttg),  glabrous2 (gl2), and apetala2 (ap2). The ats mutation resulted in a reduced  dormancy, which was maternally inherited. This effect of a testa mutation on  germination was also seen in ttg seeds, in which the outer layer of the testa was  disturbed. This indicated the importance of the testa as a factor in determining  dormancy in Arabidopsis.', '1994 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.6.3.385', 'Koornneef']
