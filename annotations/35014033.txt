First principles predict that diversity at one trophic level often begets diversity at other levels, suggesting plant and mycorrhizal fungal diversity should be coupled. Local-scale studies have shown positive coupling between the two, but the association is less consistent when extended to larger spatial and temporal scales. These inconsistencies are likely due to divergent relationships of different mycorrhizal fungal guilds to plant diversity, scale dependency, and a lack of coordinated sampling efforts. Given that mycorrhizal fungi play a central role in plant productivity and nutrient cycling, as well as ecosystem responses to global change, an improved understanding of the coupling between plant and mycorrhizal fungal diversity across scales will reduce uncertainties in predicting the ecosystem consequences of species gains and losses.
