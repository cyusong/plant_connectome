['24212884', 'With the increased availability of high-resolution sequence information,  genome-wide association (GWA) studies have become feasible in a number of  species. The vast majority of these studies are conducted in human populations,  where it is difficult to provide strong evidence for the functional involvement  of unknown genes that are identified using GWA. Here we used the model organism  Arabidopsis thaliana to combine high-throughput confocal microscopy imaging of  traits at the cellular level, GWA and expression analyses to identify genomic  regions that are associated with developmental cell-type traits. We identify and  characterize a new F-box gene, KUK, that regulates meristem and cell length. We  further show that polymorphisms in the coding sequence are the major causes of  KUK allele-dependent natural variation in root development. This work  demonstrates the feasibility of GWA using cellular traits to identify causal  genes for basic biological processes such as development.', '2014 Jan', 'Nat Genet', '10.1038/ng.2824', 'ORCID:']
