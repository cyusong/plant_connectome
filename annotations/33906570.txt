The rhizosheath is an important drought-adaptive trait in roots of many angiosperms and has been regarded as a potential trait for future agricultural sustainability. In recent studies, we found that rice roots could form a pronounced rhizosheath under moderate soil drying (MSD) but not under continuous flooding irrigation (CF). The formation of rhizosheaths substantially changes the microbial community structure in endosphere root tissues and the rhizosphere in rice, which may induce a plant immune response. However, the manner by which the formation of rhizosheaths regulates the immune system of roots remains largely unknown. Here, we have analyzed the root transcriptomes of drought-tolerant rice and drought-sensitive rice under both MSD (rhizosheath-root) and CF (root without rhizosheath) conditions. Our results suggest that rhizosheath-associated microbes may trigger plant immune pathways in root under MSD, including the first line of defense component pattern-triggered immunity and the second line of defense component effector-triggered immunity. These data expand our understanding of rhizosheath-associated microbes and plant interactions.
