Successful reproduction in the Brassicaceae is mediated by a complex series of interactions between the pollen and the pistil, and some species have an additional layer of regulation with the self-incompatibility trait. While the initial activation of the self-incompatibility pathway by the pollen S-locus protein 11/S locus cysteine-rich protein and the stigma S Receptor Kinase is well characterized, the downstream mechanisms causing self-pollen rejection are still not fully understood. In previous studies, we detected the presence of autophagic bodies with self-incompatible (SI) pollinations in Arabidopsis lyrata and transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines, but whether autophagy was essential for self-pollen rejection was unknown. Here, we investigated the requirement of autophagy in this response by crossing mutations in the essential AUTOPHAGY7 (ATG7) and ATG5 genes into two different transgenic SI A. thaliana lines in the Col-0 and C24 accessions. By using these previously characterized transgenic lines that express A. lyrata and Arabidopsis halleri self-incompatibility genes, we demonstrated that disrupting autophagy weakened their SI responses in the stigma. When the atg7 or atg5 mutations were present, an increased number of SI pollen was found to hydrate and form pollen tubes that successfully fertilized the SI pistils. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of GFP-ATG8a-labeled autophagosomes in the stigmatic papillae following SI pollinations. Together, these findings support the requirement of autophagy in the self-incompatibility response and add to the growing understanding of the intracellular mechanisms employed in the transgenic A. thaliana stigmas to reject self-pollen.
