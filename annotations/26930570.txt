Drought is one of the stresses that limit the yield of barley. Despite extensive studies focused on the issue, the molecular mechanism of the response to drought is still not fully understood. In our previous study, we proposed drought-induced signal perception controlled by actin filaments (AFs). To test this hypothesis, we used a chemical inhibitor of AF polarization-latrunculin B. In drought-treated barley leaves, latrunculin B induced AF depolymerization and altered gene expression (mainly those controlling AF formation), notably inhibiting the expression of HVA1, a dehydrin encoding gene whose function in drought tolerance has been widely studied. These results suggest that AFs might be involved in water-deficit signal perception in plant cells.

Drought: !limits! yield
AFs: !control! signal perception
Latrunculin B: !induces! AF depolymerization
HVA1: !encodes! dehydrin
AFs: !involve! water-deficit signal perception
