Phage therapy consists of applying bacteriophages, whose natural function is to kill specific bacteria. Bacteriophages are safe, evolve together with their host, and are environmentally friendly. At present, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and salt minerals (Zn<sup>2+</sup> or Cu<sup>2+</sup>) has caused the emergence of resistant strains that infect crops, causing difficulties and loss of food production. Phage therapy is an alternative that has shown positive results and can improve the treatments available for agriculture. However, the success of phage therapy depends on finding effective bacteriophages. This review focused on describing the potential, up to now, of applying phage therapy as an alternative treatment against bacterial diseases, with sustainable improvement in food production. We described the current isolation techniques, characterization, detection, and selection of lytic phages, highlighting the importance of complementary studies using genome analysis of the phage and its host. Finally, among these studies, we concentrated on the most relevant bacteriophages used for biocontrol of <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp., <i>Xanthomonas</i> spp., <i>Pectobacterium</i> spp., <i>Ralstonia</i> spp., <i>Burkholderia</i> spp., <i>Dickeya</i> spp., <i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i>, and <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> as agents that cause damage to crops, and affect food production around the world.
