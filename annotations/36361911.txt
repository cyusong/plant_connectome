L-Asparagine (Asn) has been regarded as one of the most economical molecules for nitrogen (N) storage and transport in plants due to its relatively high N-to-carbon (C) ratio (2:4) and stability. Although its internal function has been addressed, the biological role of exogenous Asn in plants remains elusive. In this study, different concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, or 5 mM) of Asn were added to the N-deficient hydroponic solution for poplar 'Nanlin895'. Morphometric analyses showed that poplar height, biomass, and photosynthesis activities were significantly promoted by Asn treatment compared with the N-free control. Moreover, the amino acid content, total N and C content, and nitrate and ammonia content were dramatically altered by Asn treatment. Moreover, exogenous Asn elicited root growth inhibition, accompanied by complex changes in the transcriptional pattern of genes and activities of enzymes associated with N and C metabolism. Combined with the plant phenotype and the physiological and biochemical indexes, our data suggest that poplar is competent to take up and utilize exogenous Asn dose-dependently. It provides valuable information and insight on how different forms of N and concentrations of Asn influence poplar root and shoot growth and function, and roles of Asn engaged in protein homeostasis regulation.
