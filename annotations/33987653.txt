Inoculation with pollution-degrading endophytes boosts the catabolism of residual contaminants and promotes the pollution adaptation of host plants. We investigated the interaction pattern between Sphingomonas strain HJY-rfp, a chlorpyrifos-degrading endophytic bacterium, and rice (Oryza sativa) under pesticide stress using hydroponic cultivation. We observed a notable trend of endophytic root colonization in rice plants treated with 10 mg l-1 chlorpyrifos solution, and after 24 h the migration of HJY-rfp enhanced the chlorpyrifos degradation rate in leaves and stems by 53.36% and 40.81%, respectively. Critically, the rice root exudate profile (organic acids and amino acids) changed under chlorpyrifos stress, and variations in the contents of several components affected the chemotactic behaviour of HJY-rfp. HJY-rfp colonization dramatically activated defensive enzymes, which enabled efficient scavenging of reactive oxygen species, and led to 9.8%, 22.5%, and 41.9% increases in shoot length, fresh weight, and accumulation of total chlorophyll, respectively, in rice suffering from oxidative damage by chlorpyrifos. Endophytic colonization caused up-regulation of detoxification genes that have shown a significant positive correlation with chlorpyrifos degradation in vivo. Collectively, our results demonstrate that agrochemical stress causes plants to actively recruit specific symbiotic microbes to detoxify contaminants and survive better under pollution conditions.
