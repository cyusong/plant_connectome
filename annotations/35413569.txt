Genes play regulatory roles in plants' response to low-temperature stress. Our understanding of the mechanism of plants' response to low-temperature stress can be expanded by studying the functions of these genes. SfGPX was cloned from Spiraea fritschiana (S. fritschiana) with the highest low-temperature tolerance, to explore the molecular mechanisms of SfGPX in response to low-temperature stress and the physiological mechanisms involved in the regulation of SfGPX to adapt to low temperature, in two species of Spiraea. SfGPX, which was localized in the cytoplasm, was induced by low temperature. The low-temperature tolerance of Spiraea fritschiana was decreased via the interference of SfGPX, and the low-temperature tolerance of Spiraea japonica 'Gold Mound' (S. japonica 'Gold Mound') was elevated via the overexpression of SfGPX. Under low-temperature stress, the photosynthetic capacity of two species of Spiraea was affected by SfGPX; it was higher in the cold-tolerant plants and lower in the cold-intolerant plants. Under low-temperature stress, the transfer intensity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was affected by SfGPX. The transfer intensity of cold-tolerant plants with lower influx level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetics was weaker than that of cold-intolerant plants. Under low-temperature stress, the transfer velocity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was affected by SfGPX, and there were slower effluxes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from Ca<sup>2+</sup> reservoir in cold-tolerant plants than in cold-intolerant plants. The above results indicate that the response of Spiraea to low temperature is regulated by SfGPX through affecting photosynthetic capacity as well as intensity and velocity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer in response to low temperature in Spiraea.
