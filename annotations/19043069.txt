Various public databases provide Arabidopsis gene information via the internet. It is useful to abstract information obtained from such databases. We have developed the KAGIANA tool, which allows a user to retrieve summary information obtained from selective databases and to access pages for a gene of interest in those databases. The tool is based on Microsoft Excel and provides several macro programs for gene expression analyses. It can assist plant biologists in accessing omics information for plant biology. The KAGIANA tool is freely available at http://pmnedo.kazusa.or.jp/kagiana/.
