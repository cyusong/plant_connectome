Fiber length is an important determinant of fiber quality, and it is a quantitative multi-genic trait. Identifying genes associated with fiber length is of great importance for efforts to improve fiber quality in the context of cotton breeding. Integrating transcriptomic information and details regarding candidate gene regions can aid in candidate gene identification. In the present study, the CCRI45 line and a chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) with a significantly higher fiber length (MBI7747) were utilized to establish F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>2:3</sub> populations. Using a high-density genetic map published previously, six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with fiber length and two QTLs associated with fiber strength were identified on four chromosomes. Within these QTLs, <i>qFL-A07-1</i>, <i>qFL-A12-2</i>, <i>qFL-A12-5</i>, and <i>qFL-D02-1</i> were identified in two or three environments and confirmed by a meta-analysis. By integrating transcriptomic data from the two parental lines and through qPCR analyses, four genes associated with these QTLs including Cellulose synthase-like protein D3 (<i>CSLD3</i>, <i>GH_A12G2259</i> for <i>qFL-A12-2</i>), expansin-A1 (<i>EXPA1</i>, <i>GH_A12G1972</i> for <i>qFL-A12-5</i>), plasmodesmata callose-binding protein 3 (<i>PDCB3</i>, <i>GH_A12G2014</i> for <i>qFL-A12-5</i>), and Polygalacturonase (<i>At1g48100</i>, <i>GH_D02G0616</i> for <i>qFL-D02-1</i>) were identified as promising candidate genes associated with fiber length. Overall, these results offer a robust foundation for further studies regarding the molecular basis for fiber length and for efforts to improve cotton fiber quality.
