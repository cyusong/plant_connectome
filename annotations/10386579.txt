['10386579', "Triacylglycerols are the most important storage lipids in most plants and  animals. Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.20) catalyzes the  final step of the pathway of triacylglycerol synthesis and is the only step which  is unique to this process. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase is required for the  synthesis of storage oil in a wide range of oil-bearing seeds and fruits and in  floral structures such as petals, anthers and pollen. We describe the first  cloning and functional expression of a cDNA encoding diacylglycerol  acyltransferase from a plant. The cDNA, cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana, encodes  a 520 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 59.0 kDa which shares  38% amino acid sequence identity with diacylglycerol acyltransferase from mouse.  When expressed in insect cell cultures, the protein catalyzes the synthesis of  [14C]triacylglycerol from [14C]diacylglycerol and acyl-CoA. Primer extension  analysis revealed that the transcription begins 225 bases before the translation  start site, yielding an unusually long 5' untranslated region. The gene is  expressed in a wide range of tissues but most strongly in developing embryos and  petals of flowers.", '1999 Jun 11', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(99)00646-8', 'Hills']
