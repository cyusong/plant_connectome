Guard cells are a model system for studying signal transduction. F-box proteins, representing one of the largest gene families in Arabidopsis, have been shown to be involved in many developmental and physiological processes, including stress responses. However, it is unclear if there is a direct link between an F-box protein and the guard cell ABA signaling. DOR is a guard cell-preferential F-box protein, and our results suggested that it likely forms two negative feedback regulatory loops for the ABA-induced stomatal closure under drought conditions in Arabidopsis. These findings have a potential impact on genetically modifying drought stress responses in plants.
