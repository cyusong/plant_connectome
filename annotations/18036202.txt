['18036202', 'Coordination between cell division and cell differentiation is crucial for growth  and development of eukaryotic organisms. Progression through the different phases  of cell division requires the specific degradation of proteins through the  ubiquitin/proteasome 26S (Ub/26S) pathway. In plants, this pathway plays a key  role in controlling several developmental processes and responses, including cell  proliferation. SKP2A, an F-box protein, regulates the stability of the cell  division E2FC-DPB transcription factor. Here, we show that the SKP2A forms a Skp,  Cullin containing (SCF) complexin vivo that has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.  Interestingly, SKP2A is degraded through the Ub/26S pathway, and auxin regulates  such degradation. SKP2A positively regulates cell division, at least in part by  degrading the E2FC/DPB transcription repressor. Plants that overexpress SKP2A  increase the number of cells in G2/M, reduce the level of ploidy and develop a  higher number of lateral root primordia. Taken together, our results indicate  that SKP2A is a positive regulator of cell division, and its stability is  controlled by auxin-dependent degradation.', '2008 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03378.x', 'del']
