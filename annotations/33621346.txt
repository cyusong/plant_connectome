Temporal turnover events in biotic interactions involving plants are rarely assessed, although such changes might afford a considerable acclimation potential to the plant. This could enable fairly rapid responses to short-term fluctuations in growth conditions as well as lasting responses to long-term climatic trends. Here, we present a classification of temporal turnover encompassing 11 possible scenarios. Using orchid mycorrhiza as a study model, we show that temporal changes are common, and discuss under which conditions temporal turnover of fungal symbiont is expected. We provide six research questions and identify technical challenges that we deem most important for future studies. Finally, we discuss how the same framework can be applied to other types of biotic interactions.
