Brassinosteriods (BRs) are plant hormones essential for plant growth and development. The receptor-like kinase (RLK) BRI1 perceives BRs to initiate a well-known transduction pathway which finally activate the transcription factors BZR1/BES1 specifically regulating BR-mediated gene expression. The RLK EMS1 governs tapetum formation via the same signaling pathway shared with BRI1. BRI1 and EMS1 have a common signal output, but the gene structural specificity and the molecular response remain unclear. In this study, we identified that the transmembrane (TM), intracellular juxtamembrane (iJM), kinase, and leucin-rich repeats 1-13 (LRR1-13) domains of EMS1 could replace the corresponding BRI1 domain to maintain the BR receptor function, whereas the extracellular juxtamembrane (eJM) and LRR1-14 domains could not, indicating that the LRR14-EJM domain conferred functional specificity to BRI1. We compared the kinase domains of EMS1 and BRI1, and found that EMS1's kinase activity was weaker than BRI1's. Further investigation of the specific phosphorylation sites in BRI1 and EMS1 revealed that the Y1052 site in the kinase domain was essential for the BRI1 biological function, but the corresponding site in EMS1 showed no effect on the biological function of EMS1, suggesting a site regulation difference in the two receptors. Furthermore, we showed that EMS1 shared the substrate BSKs with BRI1. Our study provides insight into the structural specificity and molecular mechanism of BRI1 and EMS1, as well as the origin and divergence of BR receptors.
