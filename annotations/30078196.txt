Movement characteristics are seemingly erratic yet respond to external stimuli including pathogens and light. Given these clear correlations, we still do not understand the specific roles that movement plays in these processes. There are few exceptions including organelle inheritance during cell division and photorelocation of chloroplasts to prevent photodamage. The molecular and biophysical components that drive movement can be broken down into cytoskeletal components, motor proteins and tethers, which allow organelles to physically interact with one another. Our understanding of these components and concepts has exploded over the past decade, with recent technological advances allowing an even more in-depth profiling. Here, we provide an overview of the cytoskeletal and tethering components and discuss the mechanisms behind organelle movement in higher plants.
