The phytohormones jasmonates (JAs) control plant development, growth, and defense against insects and pathogens. The Arabidopsis JA receptor Coronatine Insensitive 1 (COI1) interacts with ARABIDOPSIS SKP-LIKE1 (ASK1)/ASK2 to form the SCF<sup>COI1</sup> E3 ligase and mediate JA responses. Here, we performed a genetic suppressor screen using the leaky coi1-2 (COI1<sup>Leu245Phe</sup> ) mutant for restored sensitivity to JA, and identified the intragenic suppressor mutation Leu59Phe, which was in the region connecting the F-box and leucine-rich repeats domains of COI1. The L59F substitution not only restores the COI1<sup>L245F</sup> function, but also the COI1<sup>Gly434Glu</sup> (coi1-22<sup>rsp</sup> ) function in JA responses, through recovering their interactions with ASK1 or ASK2 and their protein levels. The L59F change itself could not enhance the interactions between COI1 and ASK1/2, nor affect JA responses. The present study reveals that the Leu59Phe substitution compensates for the effect of some deleterious mutations in the JA receptor COI1.
