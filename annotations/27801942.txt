['27801942', 'Cortical microtubules (MTs) play a major role in the patterning of secondary cell  wall (SCW) thickenings in tracheary elements (TEs) by determining the sites of  SCW deposition. The EXO70A1 subunit of the exocyst secretory vesicle tethering  complex was implicated to be important for TE development via the MT interaction.  We investigated the subcellular localization of several exocyst subunits in the  xylem of Arabidopsis thaliana and analyzed the functional significance of  exocyst-mediated trafficking in TE development. Live cell imaging of  fluorescently tagged exocyst subunits in TE using confocal microscopy and  protein-protein interaction assays were performed to describe the role of the  exocyst and its partners in TE development. In TEs, exocyst subunits were  localized to the sites of SCW deposition in an MT-dependent manner. We propose  that the mechanism of exocyst targeting to MTs involves the direct interaction of  exocyst subunits with the COG2 protein. We demonstrated the importance of a  functional exocyst subunit EXO84b for normal TE development and showed that the  deposition of SCW constituents is partially compromised, possibly as a result of  the mislocalization of secondary cellulose synthase in exocyst mutants. We  conclude that the exocyst complex is an important factor bridging the pattern  defined by cortical MTs with localized secretion of the SCW in developing TEs.', '2017 Feb', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.14267', 'Zarsky']
