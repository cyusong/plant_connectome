To clarify the relationships of flower senescence, especially sepal abscission, and ethylene receptor gene expression in different flower parts, we isolated two cDNAs encoding ethylene receptors Dl-ERS1-3 and Dl-ERS2 from Delphinium flowers. Deduced polypeptides possessed no response regulator domain, indicating that they belong to a family of ethylene response sensor (ERS) ethylene receptors. Dl-ERS1-3 and Dl-ERS2 exhibited constitutive levels during flower senescence. Exogenous ethylene increased transcript levels in sepals, which are influenced by ethylene but not in gynoecia and receptacles, which produce ethylene. It was suggested that expression of ethylene receptor genes under ethylene exposure was differentially regulated in each organ of the flower.

Dl-ERS1-3: !constitutively expressed! during flower senescence 
Dl-ERS2: !constitutively expressed! during flower senescence 
Exogenous ethylene: !increases transcript levels! in sepals 
Exogenous ethylene: !not influenced! gynoecia and receptacles 
Ethylene receptor genes: !differentially regulated! in each organ of the flower
