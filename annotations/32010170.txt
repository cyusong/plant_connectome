The genetic base of <i>Brassica napus</i> canola need to be broadened for exploitation of heterosis at a greater level in the breeding of F<sub>1</sub> hybrid canola cultivars. In this study, we evaluated 228 inbred <i>B. napus</i> canola lines derived from six <i>B. napus</i> × <i>B. oleracea</i> interspecific crosses and following two breeding methods (F<sub>2</sub>- and BC<sub>1</sub>-derived lines) to understand the effect of the <i>B. oleracea</i> alleles on heterosis for different agronomic and seed quality traits. Test hybrids of the inbreds derived from crosses involving vars. <i>botrytis</i> (cauliflower), <i>alboglabra</i> (Chinese kale) and <i>capitata</i> (cabbage) cv. Badger Shipper, on an average, gave about 10% mid-parent heterosis (MPH), and about 67% of the test hybrids gave higher seed yield than the common <i>B. napus</i> parent indicating that <i>B. oleracea</i> alleles can contribute to heterosis for seed yield in spring <i>B. napus</i> canola hybrids. This was also evident from a positive correlation of the genetic distance of the inbred lines from the common <i>B. napus</i> parent with MPH for seed yield (<i>r</i> = 0.31) as well as with hybrid yield (<i>r</i> = 0.26). Almost no correlation was found between genetic distance and MPH for seed oil and protein content as well as with the performance of the test hybrids for these two traits. The occurrence of positive correlation between seed yield of the inbred lines and test hybrids suggested the importance of the genes exerting additive effect for high seed yield in the hybrids. Very little or almost no heterosis was found for the other agronomic traits as well as for seed oil and protein content. While comparing the two breeding methods, no significant difference was found for seed yield of the test hybrids or the level of MPH; however, the BC<sub>1</sub>-derived inbred and test hybrid populations flowered and matured earlier and had longer grain-filling period than the F<sub>2</sub>-derived population. Thus, the results suggested that the <i>B. oleracea</i> gene pool can be used in the breeding of spring <i>B. napus</i> canola to improve seed yield in hybrid cultivars.
