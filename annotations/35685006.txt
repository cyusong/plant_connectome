Soil salinity limits crop productivity in arid regions and it can be alleviated by crop synergies. A multivariate analysis of published data (<i>n</i> = 78) from arid and semiarid habitats across continents was conducted to determine the crop species mechanisms of salinity tolerance and synergies relevant for designing adapted forage cropping systems. Halophyte [<i>Cynodon plectostachus</i> (K. Schum.) Pilg.] and non-halophyte grasses (<i>Lolium perenne</i> L. and <i>Panicum maximum</i> Jacq.) clustered along increasing soil salinity. Halophytic grasses [<i>Panicum antidotale</i> Retz. and <i>Dicanthum annulatum</i> (Forssk.) Stapf] congregated with <i>Medicago sativa</i> L., a non-halophytic legume along a gradient of increasing photosynthesis. Halophytic grasses [<i>Sporobolus spicatus</i> (Vahl) Kunth, and <i>Cynodon plectostachyus</i> (K. Schum.) Pilg.] had strong yield-salinity correlations. <i>Medicago sativa</i> L. and <i>Leptochloa fusca</i> L. Kunth were ubiquitous in their forage biomass production along a continuum of medium to high salinity. Forage crude protein was strongly correlated with increasing salinity in halophytic grasses and non-halophytic legumes. Halophytes were identified with mechanisms to neutralize the soil sodium accumulation and forage productivity along an increasing salinity. Overall, halophytes-non-halophytes, grass-forbs, annual-perennials, and plant-bacteria-fungi synergies were identified which can potentially form cropping systems that can ameliorate saline soils and sustain forage productivity in salt-affected arid regions.
