<i>EgMADS16</i>, one of the MADS-box transcription factors in oil palm, has a high expression level in the late fruit development of the oil palm fruit mesocarp. At the same time, it is also predicted to be the target gene of <i>EgmiR5179,</i> which has been identified in previous research. In this paper, we focused on the function and regulatory mechanism of the <i>EgMADS16</i> gene in oil palm lipid metabolism. The results indicated that the transcription level of <i>EgMADS16</i> was highest in the fourth stage, and a dual-luciferase reporter assay proved that the <i>EgMADS16</i> expression level was downregulated by <i>EgmiR5179</i>. In both the OX<i>EgMADS16 Arabidopsis</i> seeds and oil palm embryonic calli, the total lipid contents were significantly decreased, but the contents of C18:0 and C18:3 in OX<i>EgMADS16</i> lines were significantly increased. As expected, EgmiR5179 weakened the inhibitory effect of <i>EgMADS16</i> on the oil contents in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants that coexpressed <i>EgmiR5179</i> and <i>EgMADS16</i> (OXEgmiR5179-<i>EgMADS16</i>). Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and BiFC analyses suggested that there was an interaction between the <i>EgMADS16</i> protein and EgGLO1 protein, which had been proven to be capable of regulating fatty acid synthesis in our previous research work. In summary, a model of the molecular mechanism by which miRNA5179 targets <i>EgMADS16</i> to regulate oil biosynthesis was hypothesized, and the research results provide new insight into lipid accumulation and molecular regulation in oil palm.
