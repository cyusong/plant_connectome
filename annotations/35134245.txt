During the last decade, targeted genome-editing technologies, especially clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) technologies, have permitted efficient targeting of genomes, thereby modifying these genomes to offer tremendous opportunities for deciphering gene function and engineering beneficial traits in many biological systems. As a powerful genome-editing tool, the CRISPR/Cas systems, combined with the development of next-generation sequencing and many other high-throughput techniques, have thus been quickly developed into a high-throughput engineering strategy in animals and plants. Therefore, here, we review recent advances in using high-throughput genome-editing technologies in animals and plants, such as the high-throughput design of targeted guide RNA (gRNA), construction of large-scale pooled gRNA, and high-throughput genome-editing libraries, high-throughput detection of editing events, and high-throughput supervision of genome-editing products. Moreover, we outline perspectives for future applications, ranging from medication using gene therapy to crop improvement using high-throughput genome-editing technologies.
