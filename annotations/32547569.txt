The mustard family (Brassicaceae) comprises several dozen monophyletic clades usually ranked as tribes. The tribe Boechereae plays a prominent role in plant research due to the incidence of apomixis and its close relationship to <i>Arabidopsis</i>. This tribe, largely confined to western North America, harbors nine genera and c. 130 species, with >90% of species belonging to the genus <i>Boechera</i>. Hundreds of apomictic diploid and triploid <i>Boechera</i> hybrids have spurred interest in this genus, but the remaining Boechereae genomes remain virtually unstudied. Here we report on comparative genome structure of six genera (<i>Borodinia</i>, <i>Cusickiella</i>, <i>Phoenicaulis</i>, <i>Polyctenium</i>, <i>Nevada</i>, and <i>Sandbergia</i>) and three <i>Boechera</i> species as revealed by comparative chromosome painting (CCP). All analyzed taxa shared the same seven-chromosome genome structure. Comparisons with the sister Halimolobeae tribe (<i>n</i> = 8) showed that the ancestral Boechereae genome (<i>n</i> = 7) was derived from an older <i>n</i> = 8 genome by descending dysploidy followed by the divergence of extant Boechereae taxa. As tribal divergence post-dated the origin of four tribe-specific chromosomes, it is proposed that these chromosomal rearrangements were a key evolutionary innovation underlaying the origin and diversification of the Boechereae in North America. Although most Boechereae genera exhibit genomic conservatism, intra-tribal cladogenesis has occasionally been accompanied by chromosomal rearrangements (particularly inversions). Recently, apomixis was reported in the Boechereae genera <i>Borodinia</i> and <i>Phoenicaulis</i>. Here, we report sexual reproduction in diploid <i>Nevada</i>, diploid <i>Sandbergia</i>, and tetraploid <i>Cusickiella</i> and aposporous apomixis in tetraploids of <i>Polyctenium</i> and <i>Sandbergia</i>. In sum, apomixis is now known to occur in five of the nine Boechereae genera.
