Boll weight (BW) is a key determinant of yield component traits in cotton, and understanding the genetic mechanism of BW could contribute to the progress of cotton fiber yield. Although many yield-related quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for BW have been determined, knowledge of the genes controlling cotton yield remains limited. Here, association mapping based on 25,169 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2,315 insertions/deletions (InDels) was conducted to identify high-quality QTLs responsible for BW in a global collection of 290 diverse accessions, and BW was measured in nine different environments. A total of 19 significant markers were detected, and 225 candidate genes within a 400 kb region (± 200 kb surrounding each locus) were predicted. Of them, two major QTLs with highly phenotypic variation explanation on chromosomes A08 and D13 were identified among multiple environments. Furthermore, we found that two novel candidate genes (<i>Ghir_A08G009110</i> and <i>Ghir_D13G023010</i>) were associated with BW and that <i>Ghir_D13G023010</i> was involved in artificial selection during cotton breeding by population genetic analysis. The transcription level analyses showed that these two genes were significantly differentially expressed between high-BW accession and low-BW accession during the ovule development stage. Thus, these results reveal valuable information for clarifying the genetic basics of the control of BW, which are useful for increasing yield by molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding in cotton.
