['12232244', 'Three temperature-sensitive mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana that were defective  in the redifferentiation of shoots were isolated as tools for the study of  organogenesis. M3 lines were constructed by harvesting M3 seeds separately from  each M2 plant. Comparative examination of shoot redifferentiation in root  explants of 2700 M3 lines at 22[deg]C (permissive temperature) and at 27[deg]C  (restrictive temperature) led to the identification of seven  temperature-sensitive mutant lines. Genetic tests of three of the seven mutant  lines indicated that temperature-sensitive redifferentiation of shoots in these  three lines resulted from single, nuclear, recessive mutations in three different  genes, designated SRD1, SRD2, and SRD3. The morphology of root explants of srd  mutants cultured at the restrictive temperature suggests that the products of  these SRD genes function at different stages of the redifferentiation of shoots.', '1994 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.3.815', 'Komamine']
