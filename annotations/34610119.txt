Rice polluted by metal(loid)s, especially arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd), imposes serious health risks. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the obligate plant symbionts arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can reduce As and Cd concentrations in rice. The behaviours of metal(loid)s in the soil-rice-AMF system are of significant interest for scientists in the fields of plant biology, microbiology, agriculture, and environmental science. We review the mechanisms of As and Cd accumulation in rice with and without the involvement of AMF. In the context of the soil-rice-AMF system, we assess and discuss the role of AMF in affecting soil ion mobility, chemical forms, transport pathways (including the symplast and apoplast), and genotype variation. A potential strategy for AMF application in rice fields is considered, followed by future research directions to improve theoretical understanding and encourage field application.

AMF: !reduces! As and Cd concentrations in rice
AMF: !affects! soil ion mobility
AMF: !influences! chemical forms
