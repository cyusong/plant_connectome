Quiescence is a crucial survival attribute in which cell division is repressed in a reversible manner. Although quiescence has long been viewed as an inactive state, recent studies have shown that it is an actively monitored process that is influenced by environmental stimuli. Here, we provide a perspective of the quiescent state and discuss how this process is tuned by energy, nutrient and oxygen status, and the pathways that sense and transmit these signals. We not only highlight the governance of canonical regulators and signalling mechanisms that respond to changes in nutrient and energy status, but also consider the central significance of mitochondrial functions and cues as key regulators of nuclear gene expression. Furthermore, we discuss how reactive oxygen species and the associated redox processes, which are intrinsically linked to energy carbohydrate metabolism, also play a key role in the orchestration of quiescence.
