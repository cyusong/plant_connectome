Heavy metal ions which are not essential elements for basic metabolism severely threaten human health through food chain. As the most water-soluble and absorbed heavy metal ion, Cadmium (Cd) is easily accumulated and contaminates plants. Previously, mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) was proved to be required for Cd tolerance and Cd<sup>2+</sup> exclusion. In this study, we carried out following mRNA expression profile analysis on Cd-treated <i>mpc1-1</i> and wild-type plants. After further selection of differential expressed genes and Cd tolerance tests in yeast, we have discovered a novel Cd tolerance related gene: <i>AGP30</i>, which specifically expresses in root and is significantly regulated by MPC under Cd stress. This protein mainly localize in the cell wall of cells in root meristem region, which was consistent with our former Cd<sup>2+</sup> flux measurement. In conclusion, our work discovered a new Cd resistant gene for utilizing in transgenic crops for preventing Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx.
