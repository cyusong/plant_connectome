Most aerial plant surfaces are covered with a lipid-rich cuticle, which is a barrier for the bidirectional transport of substances between the plant and the surrounding environment. This review article provides an overview of the significance of the leaf cuticle as a barrier for the deposition and absorption of water and electrolytes. After providing insights into the physico-chemical properties of plant surfaces, the mechanisms of foliar absorption are revised with special emphasis on solutes. Due to the limited information and relative importance of the leaf cuticle of herbaceous and deciduous cultivated plants, an overview of the studies developed with Alpine conifers and treeline species is provided. The significance of foliar water uptake as a phenomenon of ecophysiological relevance in many areas of the world is also highlighted. Given the observed variability in structure and composition among, for example, plant species and organs, it is concluded that it is currently not possible to establish general permeability and wettability models that are valid for predicting liquid-surface interactions and the subsequent transport of water and electrolytes across plant surfaces.
