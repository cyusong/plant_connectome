['25522358', 'Although research has determined that reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as  signaling molecules in plant development, the molecular mechanism by which ROS  regulate plant growth is not well known. An aba overly sensitive mutant, abo8-1,  which is defective in a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein responsible for  the splicing of NAD4 intron 3 in mitochondrial complex I, accumulates more ROS in  root tips than the wild type, and the ROS accumulation is further enhanced by ABA  treatment. The ABO8 mutation reduces root meristem activity, which can be  enhanced by ABA treatment and reversibly recovered by addition of certain  concentrations of the reducing agent GSH. As indicated by low ProDR5:GUS  expression, auxin accumulation/signaling was reduced in abo8-1. We also found  that ABA inhibits the expression of PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2, and that root  growth is more sensitive to ABA in the plt1 and plt2 mutants than in the wild  type. The expression of PLT1 and PLT2 is significantly reduced in the abo8-1  mutant. Overexpression of PLT2 in an inducible system can largely rescue root  apical meristem (RAM)-defective phenotype of abo8-1 with and without ABA  treatment. These results suggest that ABA-promoted ROS in the mitochondria of  root tips are important retrograde signals that regulate root meristem activity  by controlling auxin accumulation/signaling and PLT expression in Arabidopsis.', '2014 Dec', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1004791', 'Gong']
