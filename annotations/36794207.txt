Saline-alkali stress seriously endangers the normal growth of <i>Populus simonii</i>×<i>P. nigra</i>. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can enhance the saline-alkali tolerance of plants by establishing a symbiotic relationship with them. In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to simulate a saline-alkali environment where <i>Populus simonii</i>×<i>P. nigra</i> were inoculated with <i>Funneliformis mosseae</i> to explore their effects on the saline-alkali tolerance of <i>Populus simonii</i>×<i>P. nigra</i>. Our results show that a total of 8 <i>NHX</i> gene family members are identified in <i>Populus simonii</i>×<i>P. nigra</i>. <i>F. mosseae</i> regulate the distribution of Na+ by inducing the expression of <i>PxNHXs</i>. The pH value of poplar rhizosphere soil is reduced, result in the promote absorption of Na<sup>+</sup> by poplar, that ultimately improved the soil environment. Under saline-alkali stress, <i>F. mosseae</i> improve the chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic parameters of poplar, promote the absorption of water, K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thus increase the plant height and fresh weight of aboveground parts, and promote the growth of poplar. Our results provide a theoretical basis for further exploring the application of AM fungi to improve the saline-alkali tolerance of plants.
