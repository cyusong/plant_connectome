['22007837', 'It is known that a senescing leaf loses water faster than a non-senescing leaf  and that ABA has an important role in promoting leaf senescence. However,  questions such as why water loss is faster, how water loss is regulated, and how  ABA functions in leaf senescence are not well understood. Here we report on the  identification and functional analysis of a leaf senescence associated gene  called SAG113. The RNA blot and GUS reporter analyses all show that SAG113 is  expressed in senescing leaves and is induced by ABA in Arabidopsis. The SAG113  expression levels are significantly reduced in aba2 and abi4 mutants. A GFP  fusion protein analysis revealed that SAG113 protein is localized in the Golgi  apparatus. SAG113 encodes a protein phosphatase that belongs to the PP2C family  and is able to functionally complement a yeast PP2C-deficient mutant TM126  (ptc1Delta). Leaf senescence is delayed in the SAG113 knockout mutant compared with  that in the wild type, stomatal movement in the senescing leaves of SAG113  knockouts is more sensitive to ABA than that of the wild type, and the rate of  water loss in senescing leaves of SAG113 knockouts is significantly reduced. In  contrast, inducible over-expression of SAG113 results in a lower sensitivity of  stomatal movement to ABA treatment, more rapid water loss, and precocious leaf  senescence. No other aspects of growth and development, including seed  germination, were observed. These findings suggest that SAG113, a negative  regulator of ABA signal transduction, is specifically involved in the control of  water loss during leaf senescence.', '2012 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04821.x', 'Gan']
