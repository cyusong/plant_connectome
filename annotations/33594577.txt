H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> priming reprograms essential proteins' expression to help plants survive, promoting responsive and unresponsive proteins adjustment to salt stress. Priming is a powerful strategy to enhance abiotic stress tolerance in plants. Despite this, there is scarce information about the mechanisms induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> priming for salt stress tolerance, particularly on proteome modulation. Improving maize cultivation in areas subjected to salinity is imperative for the local economy and food security. Thereby, this study aimed to investigate physiological changes linked with post-translational protein events induced by foliar H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> priming of Zea mays plants under salt stress. As expected, salt treatment promoted a considerable accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> ions, a 12-fold increase. It drastically affected growth parameters and relative water content, as well as promoted adverse alteration in the proteome profile, when compared to the absence of salt conditions. Conversely, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> priming was beneficial via specific proteome reprogramming, which promoted better response to salinity by 16% reduction in Na<sup>+</sup> content and shoots growth improvement, increasing 61% in dry mass. The identified proteins were associated with photosynthesis and redox homeostasis, critical metabolic pathways for helping plants survive in saline stress by the protection of chloroplasts organization and carbon fixation, as well as state redox. This research provides new proteomic data to improve understanding and forward identifying biotechnological strategies to promote salt stress tolerance.
