Besides the established functions of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the flooding response and in seed and pollen metabolism there is increasing evidence for a role of the fermentative pathway in biotic interactions. We have recently shown that barley ADH may be involved in susceptibility to the parasitic fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei (Bgh). Here, the transcriptional regulation of the barley ADH genes HvADH1 and HvADH2 after challenge of susceptible barley leaves with Bgh is addressed. Bgh infection results in an induction of HvADH1 and HvADH2, whereas HvADH3 expression was not detectable in leaves. With the use of native polyacrylamide gels the iso-enzyme composition with and without challenge by Bgh was analyzed, showing an activation of HvADH1 and HvADH2 in Bgh treated leaves.
