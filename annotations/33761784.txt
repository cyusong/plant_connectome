<i>Diaporthe</i> species are the causal agents of melanose, stem-end rot, and gummosis diseases of citrus. <i>D. citri</i> is the predominant species on different citrus varieties. These diseases exceedingly reduce quality and marketability of fresh fruits. Melanose on fruits especially causes massive economic losses. The infection mechanisms of <i>D. citri</i> are still unclear and the genome sequence of <i>D. citri</i> has not been released. In order to systemically explore the interaction between citrus and <i>D. citri</i>, we sequenced the whole-genome of <i>D. citri</i> NFHF-8-4, which was isolated from a sample with melanose in Jiangxi Province. The NFHF-8-4 genome sequence will provide valuable information for studying the development process, infection process, and resistance to fungicides mechanisms in <i>D. citri</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
