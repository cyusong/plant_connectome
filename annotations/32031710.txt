Phytohormonal interactions are crucial for plant development. Auxin and cytokinin (CK) both play critical roles in regulating plant growth and development; however, the interaction between these two phytohormones is complex and not fully understood. Here, we isolated a wild apple (Malus sieversii Roem) GRETCHEN HAGEN3 (GH3) gene, MsGH3.5, encoding an indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-amido synthetase. Overexpression of MsGH3.5 significantly reduced the free IAA content and increased the content of some IAA-amino acid conjugates, and MsGH3.5-overexpressing lines were dwarfed and produced fewer adventitious roots (ARs) than the control. This phenotype is consistent with the role of GH3 in conjugating excess free active IAA to amino acids in auxin homeostasis. Surprisingly, overexpression of MsGH3.5 significantly increased CK concentrations in the whole plant, and altered the expression of genes involved in CK biosynthesis, metabolism and signaling. Furthermore, exogenous CK application induced MsGH3.5 expression through the activity of the CK type-B response regulator, MsRR1a, which mediates the CK primary response. MsRR1a activated MsGH3.5 expression by directly binding to its promoter, linking auxin and CK signaling. Plants overexpressing MsRR1a also displayed fewer ARs, in agreement with the regulation of MsGH3.5 expression by MsRR1a. Taken together, we reveal that MsGH3.5 affects apple growth and development by modulating auxin and CK levels and signaling pathways. These findings provide insight into the interaction between the auxin and CK pathways, and might have substantial implications for efforts to improve apple architecture.
