Purple pericarps of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are a useful source of dietary anthocyanins. Previous mapping results indicated that the purple pericarp trait is controlled by two complementary genes located on chromosomes 7D and 2A. However, the identity of the genes and the mechanisms by which they regulate the trait are unknown. In this study, two transcription factors were characterised as anthocyanin activators in purple pericarps: TaPpm1 (purple pericarp-MYB 1) and TaPpb1 (purple pericarp-bHLH 1). Three non-functional variants were detected in the coding sequence of TaPpm1 from non-purple seed lines, in which the function of TaPpm1 was destroyed either by insertion-induced frame shifts or truncated peptides. There were six 261-bp tandem repeats in the promoter region of TaPpb1 in the purple-grained varieties, while there was only one repeat unit present in the non-purple varieties. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid, dual luciferase, yeast one-hybrid, and transient assays, we were able to demonstrate that the interaction of TaPpm1 and TaPpb1 co-regulates the synthesis of anthocyanin. Overall, our results provide a better understanding of the molecular basis of anthocyanin synthesis in the wheat pericarp and indicate the existence of an integrated regulatory mechanism that controls production.
