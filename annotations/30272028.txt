['30272028', 'During plant reproduction, sperm cells are delivered to ovules through growing  pollen tubes. This process involves tip-localized receptor kinases regulating  integrity and/or guidance of pollen tubes, whose localizations must be strictly  regulated. However, the molecular basis for tip-localization of these molecules  remains largely elusive. Here we show that a pair of AP180 N-terminal homology  domain-containing proteins, PICALM5a and PICALM5b, is responsible for the  tip-localization of ANXUR receptor kinases acting in an autocrine signaling  pathway required for pollen tube integrity in Arabidopsis thaliana. The picalm5a  picalm5b double mutant exhibits reduced fertility, and the double mutant pollen  is defective in pollen tube integrity with premature bursts. The tip localization  of ANXUR proteins is severely impaired in picalm5a picalm5b pollen tubes, whereas  another receptor kinase PRK6 acting in pollen tube guidance is not affected.  Based on these results, we propose that PICALM5 proteins serve as specific  loading adaptors to recycle ANXUR proteins.', '2018', 'Commun Biol', '10.1038/s42003-018-0158-8', 'ORCID:']
