['16623893', 'We have isolated and characterized a new ultraviolet B (UV-B)-resistant mutant,  uvi4 (UV-B-insensitive 4), of Arabidopsis. The fresh weight (FW) of uvi4 plants  grown under supplemental UV-B light was more than twice that of the wild-type. No  significant difference was found in their ability to repair the UV-B-induced  cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, or in the amount of UV-B absorptive compounds,  both of which are well-known factors that contribute to UV sensitivity.  Positional cloning revealed that the UVI4 gene encodes a novel basic protein of  unknown function. We found that the hypocotyl cells in uvi4 undergo one extra  round of endo-reduplication. The uvi4 mutation also promoted the progression of  endo-reduplication during leaf development. The UVI4 gene is expressed mainly in  actively dividing cells. In the leaves of P(UVI4)::GUS plants, the GUS signal  disappeared in basipetal fashion as the leaf developed. The total leaf blade area  was not different between uvi4 and the wild-type through leaf development, while  the average cell area in the adaxial epidermis was considerably larger in uvi4,  suggesting that the uvi4 leaves have fewer but larger epidermal cells. These  results suggest that UVI4 is necessary for the maintenance of the mitotic state,  and the loss of UVI4 function stimulated endo-reduplication. Tetraploid  Arabidopsis was hyper-resistant to UV-B compared to diploid Arabidopsis,  suggesting that the enhanced polyploidization is responsible for the increased  UV-B tolerance of the uvi4 mutant.', '2006 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02696.x', 'Tanaka']
