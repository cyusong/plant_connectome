['25731613', 'Chloroplast division requires filamentation temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ), a  tubulin-like GTPase of cyanobacterial endosymbiotic origin. Plants and algae  possess two distinct FtsZ protein families, FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 that co-assemble into  a ring (Z-ring) at the division site. Z-ring assembly and disassembly and  division site positioning is controlled by both positive and negative factors via  their specific interactions with FtsZ1 and FtsZ2. Here we present the in planta  analysis of Arabidopsis FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 turnover in the context of a native  chloroplast division machinery. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  analysis was conducted using fluorescently tagged FtsZ at wild-type (WT)-like  levels. Rapid photobleaching, low signal-to-noise ratio, and phototropic  movements of chloroplasts were overcome by (i) using progressive intervals in  time-lapse imaging, (ii) analyzing epidermal rather than stromal chloroplasts,  and (iii) employing image stack alignment during postprocessing. In plants of WT  background, fluorescence recovery half-times averaged 117 and 325 s for FtsZ1 and  FtsZ2, respectively. In plants lacking ARC3, the key negative regulator of FtsZ  assembly, the turnover was threefold slower. The findings are discussed in the  context of previous results conducted in a heterologous system.', '2015 Apr', 'Microsc Microanal', '10.1017/S1431927615000082', 'Holzenburg']
