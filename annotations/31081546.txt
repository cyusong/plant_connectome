Traditionally, leaves were thought to be supplied with CO<sub>2</sub> for photosynthesis by the atmosphere and respiration. Recent studies, however, have shown that the xylem also transports a significant amount of inorganic carbon into leaves through the bulk flow of water. However, little is known about the dynamics and proportion of xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> that is assimilated, vs simply lost to transpiration. Cut leaves of Populus deltoides and Brassica napus were placed in either KCl or one of three [NaH<sup>13</sup> CO<sub>3</sub> ] solutions dissolved in water to simultaneously measure the assimilation and the efflux of xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> exiting the leaf across light and CO<sub>2</sub> response curves in real-time using a tunable diode laser absorption spectroscope. The rates of assimilation and efflux of xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> increased with increasing xylem [<sup>13</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> *] and transpiration. Under saturating irradiance, rates of assimilation using xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> accounted for c. 2.5% of the total assimilation in both species in the highest [<sup>13</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> *]. The majority of xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> is assimilated, and efflux is small compared to respiration. Assimilation of xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> comprises a small portion of total photosynthesis, but may be more important when CO<sub>2</sub> is limiting.
