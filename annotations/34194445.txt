As the plant variety protection (PVP) of commercial inbred lines expire, public breeding programs gain a wealth of genetic materials that have undergone many years of intense selection; however, the value of these inbred lines is only fully realized when they have been well characterized and are used in hybrid combinations. Additionally, while yield is the primary trait by which hybrids are evaluated, new phenotyping technologies, such as ear photometry (EP), may provide an assessment of yield components that can be scaled to breeding programs. The objective of this experiment was to use EP to describe the testcross performance of inbred lines from temperate and tropical origins. We evaluated the performance of 298 public and ex-PVP inbred lines and 274 Drought Tolerant Maize for Africa (DTMA) inbred lines when crossed to Iodent (PHP02) and/or Stiff Stalk (2FACC) testers for 25 yield-related traits. Kernel weight, kernels per ear, and grain yield predicted by EP were correlated with their reference traits with <i>r</i> = 0.49, <i>r</i> = 0.88, and <i>r</i> = 0.75, respectively. The testcross performance of each maize inbred line was tester dependent. When lines were crossed to a tester within the heterotic group, many yield components related to ear size and kernels per ear were significantly reduced, but kernel size was rarely impacted. Thus, the effect of heterosis was more noticeable on traits that increased kernels per ear rather than kernel size. Hybrids of DTMA inbred lines crossed to PHP02 exhibited phenotypes similar to testcrosses of Stiff Stalk and Non-Stiff Stalk heterotic groups for yield due to significant increases in kernel size to compensate for a reduction in kernels per ear. Kernels per ear and ear length were correlated (<i>r</i> = 0.89 and <i>r</i> = 0.84, respectively) with and more heritable than yield, suggesting these traits could be useful for inbred selection.
