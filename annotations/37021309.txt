Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) is a critical part of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and plays crucial roles in growth, development and abiotic stress response in plants. Although <i>UBC</i> genes have been detected in several plant species, characterization of this gene family at the whole-genome level has not been conducted in <i>Brassica napus</i>. In the present study, 200 putative <i>BnUBCs</i> were identified in <i>B. napus</i>, which were clustered into 18 subgroups based on phylogenetic analysis. <i>BnUBC</i>s within each subgroup showed relatively conserved gene architectures and motifs. Moreover, the gene expression patterns in various tissues as well as the identification of <i>cis</i>-acting regulatory elements in <i>BnUBC</i> promoters suggested further investigation of their potential functions in plant growth and development. Furthermore, three <i>BnUBC</i>s were predicted as candidate genes for regulating agronomic traits related to oil content and yield through association mapping. In conclusion, this study provided a wealth of information on the <i>UBC</i> family in <i>B. napus</i> and revealed their effects on oil content and yield, which will aid future functional research and genetic breeding of <i>B. napus</i>.
