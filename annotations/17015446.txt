['17015446', 'Cold temperatures trigger the expression of the CBF family of transcription  factors, which in turn activate many downstream genes that confer freezing  tolerance to plants. It has been shown previously that the cold regulation of  CBF3 involves an upstream bHLH-type transcription factor, ICE1. ICE1 binds to the  Myc recognition sequences in the CBF3 promoter. Apart from Myc recognition  sequences, CBF promoters also have Myb recognition sequences. We report here that  the Arabidopsis MYB15 is involved in cold-regulation of CBF genes and in the  development of freezing tolerance. The MYB15 gene transcript is up-regulated by  cold stress. The MYB15 protein interacts with ICE1 and binds to Myb recognition  sequences in the promoters of CBF genes. Overexpression of MYB15 results in  reduced expression of CBF genes whereas its loss-of-function leads to increased  expression of CBF genes in the cold. The myb15 mutant plants show increased  tolerance to freezing stress whereas its overexpression reduces freezing  tolerance. Our results suggest that MYB15 is part of a complex network of  transcription factors controlling the expression of CBFs and other genes in  response to cold stress.', '2006 Dec 8', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M605895200', 'Zhu']
