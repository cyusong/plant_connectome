This study demonstrates that brassinosteroid is essential for seedling and shoot growth in moso bamboo. The shoot of moso bamboo is known to grow extremely fast. The roles of phytohormones in such fast growth of bamboo shoot remain unclear. Here we reported that endogenous brassinosteroid (BR) is a major factor promoting bamboo shoot internode elongation. Reducing endogenous brassinosteroid level by its biosynthesis inhibitor propiconazole stunted shoot growth in seedling stage, whereas exogenous BR application promoted scale leaf elongation and the inclination of lamina joint of leaves and scale leaves. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis identified hundreds of genes whose expression levels are altered by BR and propiconazole in shoots and roots of bamboo seedling. The data show that BR regulates cell wall-related genes, hydrogen peroxide catabolic genes, and auxin-related genes. Our study demonstrates an essential role of BR in fast growth bamboo shoots and identifies a large number of BR-responsive genes in bamboo seedlings.
