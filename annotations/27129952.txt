Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Craterostigma plantagineum has two transketolase genes (transketolase 7 and 10) which are separated from the other transketolase genes including transketolase 3 from C. plantagineum We obtained recombinant transketolase 3, 7, and 10 of C. plantagineum and showed that transketolase 7 and 10 of C. plantagineum, but not transketolase 3, catalyse the formation of octulose-8-phosphate in vitro Transketolase 7 and 10 of C. plantagineum performed the exchange reaction that produces octulose-8-phosphate using glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate as substrates. Octulose is localized in the cytosol and phloem exudate analysis showed that octulose was the dominant sugar exported from the leaves to the roots.
