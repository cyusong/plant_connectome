['20566637', 'RNA editing in flowering plant mitochondria post-transcriptionally alters several  hundred nucleotides from C to U, mostly in mRNAs. Several factors required for  specific RNA-editing events in plant mitochondria and plastids have been  identified, all of them PPR proteins of the PLS subclass with a C-terminal  E-domain and about half also with an additional DYW domain. Based on this  information, we here probe the connection between E-PPR proteins and RNA editing  in plant mitochondria. We initiated a reverse genetics screen of T-DNA insertion  lines in Arabidopsis thaliana and investigated 58 of the 150 E-PPR-coding genes  for a function in RNA editing. Six genes were identified to be involved in  mitochondrial RNA editing at specific sites. Homozygous mutants of the five genes  MEF18-MEF22 display no gross disturbance in their growth or development patterns,  suggesting that the editing sites affected are not crucial at least in the  greenhouse. These results show that a considerable percentage of the E-PPR  proteins are involved in the functional processing of site-specific RNA editing  in plant mitochondria.', '2010 Aug 27', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M110.128611', 'Brennicke']
