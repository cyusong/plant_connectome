Biomass energy is an essential component of the agriculture economy and represents an important and particularly significant renewable energy source in the fight against fossil fuel depletion and global warming. The recognition that many plants naturally synthesize hydrocarbons makes these oil plants indispensable resources for biomass energy, and the advancement of next-generation sequencing technology in recent years has now made available mountains of data on plants that synthesize oil. We have utilized a combination of bioinformatic protocols to acquire key information from this massive amount of genomic data and to assemble it into an oil plant genomic information repository, built through website technology, including Django, Bootstrap, and echarts, to create the Genomic Information Repository for Oil Plants (GROP) portal (http://grop.site/) for genomics research on oil plants. The current version of GROP integrates the coding sequences, protein sequences, genome structure, functional annotation information, and other information from 18 species, 22 genome assemblies, and 46 transcriptomes. GROP also provides BLAST, genome browser, functional enrichment, and search tools. The integration of the massive amounts of oil plant genomic data with key bioinformatics tools in a database with a user-friendly interface allows GROP to serve as a central information repository to facilitate studies on oil plants by researchers worldwide.
