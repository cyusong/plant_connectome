['19781011', 'Salicylic acid (SA) has been characterized as an activator of pathogen-triggered  resistance of plants. SA also regulates developmental processes such as  thermogenesis in floral organs and stress-induced flowering. To deepen our  knowledge of the mechanism underlying SA regulation of flowering time in  Arabidopsis, we compared the transcriptomes of SA-deficient late flowering  genotypes with wild-type plants. Down- or up-regulated genes in SA-deficient  plants were screened for responsiveness to ultraviolet (UV)-C light, which  accelerates flowering in Arabidopsis. Among them, only Pathogen and Circadian  Controlled 1 (PCC1) was up-regulated by UV-C light through a SA-dependent  process. Moreover, UV-C light-activated expression of PCC1 was also dependent on  the flowering activator CONSTANS (CO). PCC1 gene has a circadian-regulated  developmental pattern of expression with low transcript levels after germination  that increased abruptly by day 10. RNAi plants with very low expression of PCC1  gene were late flowering, defective in UV-C light acceleration of flowering and  contained FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) transcript levels below 5% of that detected in  wild-type plants. Although PCC1 seems to function between CO and FT in the  photoperiod-dependent flowering pathway, transgenic plants overexpressing a  Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR)-fused version of CO strongly activated FT but not  PCC1 after dexamethasone treatment.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.02045.x', 'Leon']
