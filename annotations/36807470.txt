Phosphate (Pi) deficiency leads to the induction of purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) in plants, which dephosphorylates organic phosphorus complexes in the rhizosphere and intracellular compartments to release Pi. In this study, we demonstrate that OsPAP3b belongs to group III low molecular weight PAP, and is low Pi responsive, preferentially in roots. The expression of OsPAP3b is negatively regulated with Pi re-supply. Interestingly, OsPAP3b was found to be dual localized to the nucleus and secretome. Furthermore, OsPAP3b is transcriptionally regulated by OsPHR2 as substantiated by DNA-protein binding assay. Through in-vitro biochemical assays, we further demonstrate that OsPAP3b is a functional acid phosphatase with broad substrate specificity. Overexpression of OsPAP3b in rice led to increased secreted APase activity and improved mineralization of organic P sources, reflected in better growth of transgenics compared to wild type when grown on organic P as exogenous P substrate. Under Pi deprivation, OsPAP3b knockdown and knockout lines showed no significant changes in total P content and dry biomass. However, the expression of other phosphate starvation-induced (PSI) genes and the levels of metabolites were found to be altered in the overexpression and knockdown lines. In addition, in-vitro pull-down assay revealed multiple putative interacting proteins of OsPAP3b. Our data collectively suggest that OsPAP3b can aid in organic P utilization in rice. The APase isoforms behavior and nuclear localization indicate its additional role, possibly in stress signaling. Considering its important roles, OsPAP3b could be a potential target for improving low Pi adaptation in rice.
