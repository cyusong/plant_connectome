['10840062', 'Control of cellular proliferation in plant meristems is important for maintaining  the correct number and position of developing organs. One of the genes identified  in the control of floral and apical meristem size and floral organ number in  Arabidopsis thaliana is WIGGUM. In wiggum mutants, one of the most striking  phenotypes is an increase in floral organ number, particularly in the sepals and  petals, correlating with an increase in the width of young floral meristems.  Additional phenotypes include reduced and delayed germination, delayed flowering,  maturation, and senescence, decreased internode elongation, shortened roots,  aberrant phyllotaxy of flowers, aberrant sepal development, floral buds that open  precociously, and occasional apical meristem fasciation. As a first step in  determining a molecular function for WIGGUM, we used positional cloning to  identify the gene. DNA sequencing revealed that WIGGUM is identical to ERA1  (enhanced response to abscisic acid), a previously identified farnesyltransferase  beta-subunit gene of Arabidopsis. This finding provides a link between protein  modification by farnesylation and the control of meristem size. Using in situ  hybridization, we examined the expression of ERA1 throughout development and  found it to be nearly ubiquitous. This extensive expression domain is consistent  with the pleiotropic nature of wiggum mutants and highlights a broad utility for  farnesylation in plant growth and development.', '2000 Jun 20', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.130189397', 'Meyerowitz']
