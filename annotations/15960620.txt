['15960620', 'Phosphatidic acid (PA) functions as a lipid signaling molecule in plants.  Physiological analysis showed that PA triggers early signal transduction events  that lead to responses to abscisic acid (ABA) during seed germination. We  measured PA production during seed germination and found increased PA levels  during early germination. To investigate the role of PA during seed germination,  we focused on the PA catabolic enzyme lipid phosphate phosphatase (LPP). LPP  catalyzes the conversion of PA to diacylglycerol (DAG). There are 4 LPP genes in  the Arabidopsis genome. Among them, AtLPP2 and AtLPP3 are expressed during seed  germination. Two AtLPP2 T-DNA insertional mutants (lpp2-1 and lpp2-2) showed  hypersensitivity to ABA and significant PA accumulation during germination.  Furthermore, double-mutant analysis showed that ABA-insensitive 4 (ABI4) is  epistatic to AtLPP2 but ABA-insensitive 3 (ABI3) is not. These results suggest  that PA is involved in ABA signaling and that AtLPP2 functions as a negative  regulator upstream of ABI4, which encodes an AP2-type transcription factor, in  ABA signaling during germination.', '2005 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02431.x', 'Shinozaki']
