Fruiting efficiency (FE, grains per g of spike dry weight at anthesis) was proposed as a promising spike trait to improve wheat yield potential, based on its functional relationship with grain number determination and the evidence of trait variability in elite germplasm. During the last few years, we have witnessed great advances in the understanding of the physiological and genetic basis of this trait. The present review summarizes the recent heritability estimations and the genetic gains obtained when fruiting efficiency was measured at maturity (FEm, grains per g of chaff) and used as selection criterion. In addition, we propose spike ideotypes for contrasting fruiting efficiencies based on the fertile floret efficiency (FFE, fertile florets per g of spike dry weight at anthesis) and grain set (grains per fertile floret), together with other spike fertility-related traits. We also review novel genes and quantitative trait loci available for using marker-assisted selection for fruiting efficiency and other spike fertility traits. The possible trade-off between FE and grain weight and the genes reported to alter this relation are also considered. Finally, we discuss the benefits and future steps towards the use of fruiting efficiency as a selection criterion in breeding programs.
