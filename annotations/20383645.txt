['20383645', 'Auxin is a key plant hormone that regulates various aspects of plant development.  However, the mechanisms integrating auxin growth effects with stress responses  are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possible role of  calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1), an Arabidopsis thaliana  calcium/calmodulin-binding transcription activator, in auxin signaling and its  responses to different stresses. Plants harboring the AtCAMTA1 promoter fused to  the GUS reporter gene revealed cell-specific expression patterns reminiscent of  auxin responses. The responsiveness of CAMTA1 to auxin was further assessed by  chemical disturbances in polar auxin transport, and by RT-PCR analysis of gene  expression of dissected leaf sections from plants exposed to the auxin transport  inhibitor NPA. Furthermore, the intensity and cell-specific expression patterns  of CAMTA1 changed significantly and differentially on exposure to increasing salt  concentrations and heat. Transcriptome analysis of a camta1 T-DNA insertion  mutant revealed 63 up-regulated genes, of which 17 are associated with auxin  signaling. Finally, analysis of hypocotyl elongation in the presence and absence  of auxin revealed that camta1 T-DNA insertion mutants and CAMTA1-repressor lines  are hyper-responsive to auxin compared to wild-type seedlings. Thus, CAMTA1  participates in auxin signaling and responds to abiotic stresses.', '2010 Jun', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-010-1153-6', 'Fromm']
