<i>Cleistogenes</i> (Orininae, Cynodonteae, Chloridoideae, Poaceae) is an ecologically important genus. The phylogenetic placement of <i>Cleistogenes</i> and phylogenetic relationships among <i>Cleistogenes</i> taxa remain controversial for a long time. To resolve the intra- and inter-generic relationships of <i>Cleistogenes</i>, the plastomes of 12 <i>Cleistogenes</i> taxa (including 8 species and 4 varieties), one <i>Orinus</i> species, 15 <i>Triodia</i> species, two <i>Tripogon</i> species, and two <i>Aeluropus</i> species were included in the present study. All the taxa showed a similar pattern in plastome structure, gene order, gene content, and IR boundaries. The number of simple sequence repeats ranged from 145 (<i>O. kokonorica</i>) to 161 (<i>T. plurinervata</i> and <i>T. schinzii</i>). Moreover, 1,687 repeats were identified in these taxa, including 1,012 forward, 650 palindromic, 24 reverse, and one complement. Codon usage analysis revealed that these plastomes contained 16,633 (<i>T. stipoides</i>) to 16,678 (<i>T. tomentosa</i>) codons. Sequence divergence analysis among <i>Cleistogenes</i> and closely related genera identified five non-coding regions (<i>trnS-UGA-psbZ</i>, <i>rpl32-trnL-UAG</i>, <i>trnQ-UUG-psbK</i>, <i>trnD-GUC-psbM</i>, <i>trnT-GGU-trnE-UUC</i>). Phylogenetic analysis of complete plastomes indicated that <i>Cleistogenes</i> is sister to a clade composed of <i>Orinus</i> and <i>Triodia</i>, whereas it did not support the sister relationship between the recently proposed subtribe Orininae (<i>Cleistogenes</i> and <i>Orinus</i>) and <i>Triodia</i>. The subtribe Orininae was not supported by our complete plastome data. The split between <i>Cleistogenes</i> and <i>Orinus</i>-<i>Triodia</i> clade go back to 14.01 Ma. Besides, our findings suggested that <i>C. squarrosa</i> and <i>C. songorica</i> are the successive early diverging groups in the phylogenetic analysis. The other 10 taxa are divided into two groups: a monophyletic group composed of <i>Cleistogenes</i> sp. nov. and <i>C. caespitosa</i> var. <i>ramosa</i> is sister to other eight <i>Cleistogenes</i> taxa. <i>Cleistogenes</i> was estimated to have experienced rapid divergence within a short period, which could be a major obstacle in resolving phylogenetic relationships within <i>Cleistogenes</i>. Collectively, our results provided valuable insights into the phylogenetic study of grass species.
