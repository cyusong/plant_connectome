We have previously identified three lesion-mimic mutants, cell death and resistance (cdr), in rice. These mutants induce a series of defense responses, including expression of defense-related genes and high accumulation of phytoalexins, indicating that the cdr mutants are useful materials to study programmed cell death and defense signaling in rice. Here, we carried out a proteome analysis of the cdr2 mutant. Total proteins prepared from the wild type and the cdr2 mutant at three different stages of lesion formation were compared using two-dimensional electrophoresis. We found a total of 37 proteins that were differentially expressed between cdr2 and wild type. Among them, 28 spots were up-regulated and nine were down-regulated in the cdr2 mutant. All the protein spots were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. These differentially regulated proteins included defense-related proteins. In addition, 27 proteins were classified as metabolic enzymes, suggesting that the programmed cell death that occurs in the cdr2 mutant is associated with active metabolic changes. Our study shows that proteome analysis is a useful approach to study programmed cell death and defense signaling in plants.
