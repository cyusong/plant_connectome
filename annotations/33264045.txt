<i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> can rapidly deploy specialized functions to deal with abiotic and biotic stresses. Host niches pose specific sets of environmental challenges driven, in part, by immune defenses. Bacteria use a "just-in-time" strategy of gene regulation, meaning that they only produce the functions necessary for survival as needed. Extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors transduce a specific set of environmental signals and change gene expression patterns by altering RNA polymerase promoter specificity, to adjust bacterial physiology, structure, or behavior, singly or in combination, to improve chances of survival. The broadly conserved ECF sigma factor AlgU affects virulence in both animal and plant pathogens. <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> AlgU controls expression of more than 800 genes, some of which contribute to suppression of plant immunity and bacterial fitness in plants. This review discusses AlgU activation mechanisms, functions controlled by AlgU, and how these functions contribute to <i>P. syringae</i> survival in plants.[Formula: see text] The author(s) have dedicated the work to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 "No Rights Reserved" license by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. 2021.
