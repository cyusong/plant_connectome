Le Roux et al. suggest that documented increases in local plant richness in response to climate change should consider the nature of 'new' species. They find that species responsible for increases in richness in areas that have experienced significant disturbance and climate change are often invasive and/or weedy species.

Climate Change: !affects! Plant Richness
Species: !responsible for! Increases in Richness 
Disturbance: !causes! Climate Change 
Species: !often! Invasive/Weedy
