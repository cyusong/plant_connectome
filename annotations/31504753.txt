Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates fruit ripening, yet little is known about the exact roles of ABA receptors in fruit. In this study, we reveal the role of SlPYL9, a tomato pyrabactin resistance (PYR)/pyrobactin resistance-like (PYL)/regulatory component of ABA receptors (RCAR) protein, as a positive regulator of ABA signaling and fruit ripening. SlPYL9 inhibits protein phosphatase-type 2C (PP2C2/6) in an ABA dose-dependent way, and it interacts physically with SlPP2C2/3/4/5 in an ABA-dependent manner. Expression of SlPYL9 was observed in the seeds, flowers, and fruits. Overexpression and suppression of SlPYL9 induced a variety of phenotypes via altered expression of ABA signaling genes (SlPP2C1/2/9, SlSnRK2.8, SlABF2), thereby affecting expression of ripening-related genes involved in ethylene release and cell wall modification. SlPYL9-OE/RNAi plants showed a typical ABA hyper-/hypo-sensitive phenotype in terms of seed germination, primary root growth, and response to drought. Fruit ripening was significantly accelerated in SlPYL9-OE by 5-7 d as a result of increased endogenous ABA accumulation and advanced release of ethylene compared with the wild-type. In the SlPYL9-RNAi lines, fruit ripening was delayed, mesocarp thickness was enhanced, and petal abscission was delayed compared with the wild-type, resulting in conical/oblong and gourd-shaped fruits. These results suggest that SlPYL9 is involved in ABA signaling, thereby playing a role in the regulation of flower abscission and fruit ripening in tomato.
