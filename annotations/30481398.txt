Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation has been reported to induce defence responses to pathogens in growing crops and described as a new environmentally friendly method for disease control. However, whether the effect of the induced defence mechanisms will persist after the stress imposed by UV-C is alleviated and how these mechanisms interact with pathogen elicitors upon infection have not yet been investigated. Thus, we inoculated strawberry plants with Mycosphaerella fragariae, the causal agent of leaf spot disease, after 5 weeks of repeated UV-C irradiation treatment (cumulative dose of 10.2 kJ m<sup>-2</sup> ) and investigated the alteration of gene expression and biochemical phenotypes. The results revealed that UV-C treatment had a significant impact on gene expression in strawberry leaves and led to the overexpression of a set of genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction. UV-C-treated leaves displayed a stronger response to infection after inoculation, with reduced symptoms and increases in accumulation of total phenolics and volatile terpenes, higher expression of pathogenesis-related proteins and the activity of several defence enzymes. This study presumptively describe, for the first time, the involvement of terpenes, reactive oxygen species, and abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and their transduction factors, in the network underpinning UV-C priming of growing crops for improved protection against pathogens.
