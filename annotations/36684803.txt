Bacterial wilt disease (BWD), caused by <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> is a major challenge for peanut production in China and significantly affects global peanut field productivity. It is imperative to identify genetic loci and putative genes controlling resistance to <i>R. solanacearum</i> (RRS). Therefore, a sequencing-based trait mapping approach termed "QTL-seq" was applied to a recombination inbred line population of 581 individuals from the cross of Yueyou 92 (resistant) and Xinhuixiaoli (susceptible). A total of 381,642 homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 98,918 InDels were identified through whole genome resequencing of resistant and susceptible parents for RRS. Using QTL-seq analysis, a candidate genomic region comprising of 7.2 Mb (1.8-9.0 Mb) was identified on chromosome 12 which was found to be significantly associated with RRS based on combined Euclidean Distance (ED) and SNP-index methods. This candidate genomic region had 180 nonsynonymous SNPs and 14 InDels that affected 75 and 11 putative candidate genes, respectively. Finally, eight nucleotide binding site leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) putative resistant genes were identified as the important candidate genes with high confidence. Two diagnostic SNP markers were validated and revealed high phenotypic variation in the different resistant and susceptible RIL lines. These findings advocate the expediency of the QTL-seq approach for precise and rapid identification of candidate genomic regions, and the development of diagnostic markers that are applicable in breeding disease-resistant peanut varieties.
