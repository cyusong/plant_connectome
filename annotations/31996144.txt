Shoot branching is an important trait of plants that allows them to adapt to environment changes. Strigolactones (SLs) are newly identified plant hormones that inhibit shoot branching in plants. The SL biosynthesis genes CCD7 (carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7) and CCD8 have been found to regulate branching in several herbaceous plants by taking advantage of their loss-of-function mutants. However, the role for CCD7 and CCD8 in shoot branching control in grapevine is still unknown due to the lack of corresponding mutants. Here we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to edit the VvCCD7 and VvCCD8 genes in the grape hybrid 41B. The 41B embryogenic cells can easily be transformed and used for regeneration of the corresponding transformed plants. Sequencing analysis revealed that gene editing has been used successfully to target both VvCCD genes in 41B embryogenic cells. After regeneration, six 41B plantlets were identified as transgenic plants carrying the CCD8-sgRNA expression cassette. Among these, four plants showed mutation in the target region and were selected as ccd8 mutants. These ccd8 mutants showed increased shoot branching compared to the corresponding wild-type plants. In addition, no off-target mutation was detected in the tested mutants at predicted off-target sites. Our results underline the key role of VvCCD8 in the control of grapevine shoot branching.
