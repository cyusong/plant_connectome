CCCH-type zinc finger proteins (ZFP) are a large family of proteins that play various important roles in plant growth and development; however, the functions of most proteins in this family are uncharacterized. In this study, a CCCH-type ZFP, AaZFP3, was identified in the floral organ of Adonis amurensis. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that AaZFP3 was widely expressed in the flowers of A.amurensis. Subcellular localization analysis showed that the AaZFP3 protein was mainly localized to the cytoplasm in tobacco and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the overexpression of AaZFP3 promoted early flowering in Arabidopsis under both normal and relatively low-temperature conditions. RNA-sequencing and qPCR analyses revealed that the expression of multiple key flowering-time genes was altered in transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing AaZFP3 compared to wild-type. Of these genes, FLOWERING LOCUS T (AtFT) expression was most significantly up-regulated, whereas FLOWERING LOCUS C (AtFLC) was significantly down-regulated. These results suggest that the overexpression of AaZFP3 promotes early flowering in Arabidopsis by affecting the expression of flowering-time genes. Overall, our study indicates that AaZFP3 may be involved in flowering regulation in A.amurensis and may represent an important genetic resource for improving flowering-time control in other ornamental plants or crops.
