['21321051', 'The plant hormone jasmonate (JA) plays important roles in the regulation of plant  defence and development. JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins inhibit  transcription factors that regulate early JA-responsive genes, and JA-induced  degradation of JAZ proteins thus allows expression of these response genes. To  date, MYC2 is the only transcription factor known to interact directly with JAZ  proteins and regulate early JA responses, but the phenotype of myc2 mutants  suggests that other transcription factors also activate JA responses. To identify  JAZ1-interacting proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen of an Arabidopsis cDNA  library was performed. Two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, MYC3 and MYC4,  were identified. MYC3 and MYC4 share high sequence similarity with MYC2,  suggesting they may have similar biological functions. MYC3 and MYC4 interact not  only with JAZ1 but also with other JAZ proteins (JAZ3 and JAZ9) in both yeast  two-hybrid and pull-down assays. MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 were all capable of  inducing expression of JAZ::GUS reporter constructs following transfection of  carrot protoplasts. Although myc3 and myc4 loss-of-function mutants showed no  phenotype, transgenic plants overexpressing MYC3 and MYC4 had higher levels of  anthocyanin compared to the wild-type plants. In addition, roots of MYC3  overexpression plants were hypersensitive to JA. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR  expression analysis of nine JA-responsive genes revealed that eight of them were  induced in MYC3 and MYC4 overexpression plants, except for a pathogen-responsive  gene, PDF1.2. Similar to MYC2, MYC4 negatively regulates expression of PDF1.2.  Together, these results suggest that MYC3 and MYC4 are JAZ-interacting  transcription factors that regulate JA responses.', '2011 Mar', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erq408', 'Browse']
