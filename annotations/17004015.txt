Previously we reported that purified Cell Wall Peroxidase-Cationic (CWPO-C) from poplar callus (Populus alba L.) oxidizes sinapyl alcohol and polymeric substrate unlike other plant peroxidases and proposed that this isoenzyme is a conceivable lignification specific peroxidase. In this study, we cloned full-length cDNA of CWPO-C and investigated the transcription of CWPO-C gene in various organs and the localization of CWPO-C protein in the differentiating xylem of poplar stem.Real-time PCR analyses indicated that CWPO-C gene is constitutively expressed in the developing xylem, leaf, and shoot but not affected by many stress treatments. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CWPO-C locates in the middle lamellae, cell corners, and secondary cell walls of the fiber cells during the lignification. The intensity of the CWPO-C labeling increased gradually from the cell wall thickening stage to mature stage of fiber cells, which is very consistent with the increase of lignin content in the developing xylem. These results strongly support that CWPO-C is responsible for the lignification of the secondary xylem. Interestingly, immuno-labeling of CWPO-C was also observed inside of the ray parenchyma cells instead no signals were detected within the developing fiber cells. This suggests that CWPO-C is biosynthesized in the parenchyma cells and provided to the middle lamellae, the cell corners, and the cell walls to achieve lignin polymerization.
