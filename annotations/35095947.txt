Efficient separation of the plant cell wall polymers during lignocellulose processing has been historically challenging due to insolubility of the polymers and their propensity for recalcitrant reassembly. Methods, such as "lignin first" extraction techniques, have advanced efficient biomass use, but the molecular mechanisms for recalcitrance remain enigmatic. Here, we discuss how solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) approaches report on the 3D organization of cellulose, xylan, and lignin in the plant cell wall. Recent results illustrate that the organization of these polymers varies across biomass sources and sample preparation methods, with even minimal physical processing causing significant effects. These structural differences contribute to variable extraction efficiencies for bioproducts after downstream processing. We propose that solid-state NMR methods can be applied to follow biomass processing, providing an understanding of the polymer rearrangements that can lead to poor yields for the desired bioproducts. The utility of the technique is illustrated for mechanical processing using lab-scale vibratory ball milling of <i>Sorghum bicolor</i>.
