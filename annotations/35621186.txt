Liquid-like condensates are organized by multivalent intrinsically disordered proteins and RNA molecules. We here demonstrate that N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A)-modified RNA is widespread in establishing diverse plant cell condensates. Several m<sup>6</sup>A-reader proteins contain putative prion-like domains, and the <i>ect2/3/4</i> mutant exhibited reduced formation of key nuclear and cytoplasmic condensates in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
