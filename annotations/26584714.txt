The plasma membrane (PM) H(+)-ATPase is an important ion pump in the plant cell membrane. By extruding protons from the cell and generating a membrane potential, this pump energizes the PM, which is a prerequisite for growth. Modification of the autoinhibitory terminal domains activates PM H(+)-ATPase activity, and on this basis it has been hypothesized that these regulatory termini are targets for physiological factors that activate or inhibit proton pumping. In this review, we focus on the posttranslational regulation of the PM H(+)-ATPase and place regulation of the pump in an evolutionary and physiological context. The emerging picture is that multiple signals regulating plant growth interfere with the posttranslational regulation of the PM H(+)-ATPase.

Plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase: !modifies! autoinhibitory terminal domains 
Physiological factors: !activate/inhibit! PM H(+)-ATPase activity 
Multiple signals: !regulate! posttranslational regulation of PM H(+)-ATPase 
Signals: !interfere with! plant growth
