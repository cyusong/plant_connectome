Submergence induces hypoxia in plants; exposure to oxygen following submergence, termed reoxygenation, produces a burst of reactive oxygen species. The mechanisms of hypoxia sensing and signaling in plants have been well studied, but how plants respond to reoxygenation remains unclear. Here, we show that reoxygenation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) involves rapid accumulation of jasmonates (JAs) and increased transcript levels of JA biosynthesis genes. Application of exogenous methyl jasmonate improved tolerance to reoxygenation in wild-type Arabidopsis; also, mutants deficient in JA biosynthesis and signaling were very sensitive to reoxygenation. Moreover, overexpression of the transcription factor gene <i>MYC2</i> enhanced tolerance to posthypoxic stress, and <i>myc2</i> knockout mutants showed increased sensitivity to reoxygenation, indicating that MYC2 functions as a key regulator in the JA-mediated reoxygenation response. MYC2 transcriptionally activates members of the <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE</i> (<i>VTC</i>) and <i>GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE</i> (<i>GSH</i>) gene families, which encode rate-limiting enzymes in the ascorbate and glutathione synthesis pathways. Overexpression of <i>VTC1</i> and <i>GSH1</i> in the <i>myc2-2</i> mutant suppressed the posthypoxic hypersensitive phenotype. The JA-inducible accumulation of antioxidants may alleviate oxidative damage caused by reoxygenation, improving plant survival after submergence. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that JA signaling interacts with the antioxidant pathway to regulate reoxygenation responses in Arabidopsis.
