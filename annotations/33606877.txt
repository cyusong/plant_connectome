Heterosis has been extensively utilized to increase productivity in crops, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we generated transcriptome-wide profiles of mRNA abundance, m6A methylation, and translational efficiency from the maize F1 hybrid B73×Mo17 and its two parental lines to ascertain the contribution of each regulatory layer to heterosis at the seedling stage. We documented that although the global abundance and distribution of m6A remained unchanged, a greater number of genes had gained an m6A modification in the hybrid. Superior variations were observed at the m6A modification and translational efficiency levels when compared with mRNA abundance between the hybrid and parents. In the hybrid, the vast majority of genes with m6A modification exhibited a non-additive expression pattern, the percentage of which was much higher than that at levels of mRNA abundance and translational efficiency. Non-additive genes involved in different biological processes were hierarchically coordinated by discrete combinations of three regulatory layers. These findings suggest that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression make distinct contributions to heterosis in hybrid maize. Overall, this integrated multi-omics analysis provides a valuable portfolio for interpreting transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in hybrid maize, and paves the way for exploring molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid vigor.
