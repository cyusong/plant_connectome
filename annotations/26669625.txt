Increasing soil salinity threatens crop productivity worldwide. High soil salinity is usually accompanied by the low availability of many mineral nutrients. Here, we investigated the potential role that the H(+)- PPase could play in optimizing P use efficiency under salinity in plants. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing either SeVP1 or SeVP2 from Salicornia europaea outperformed the wild-types under low phosphate (Pi) as well as low Pi plus salt conditions. Our results suggested that H(+)-PPase could increase external Pi acquisition through promoting root development and upregulating phosphate transporters, thus to protect plants from Pi limiting stress. This study provides a potential strategy for improving crop yields challenged by the co-occurrence of abiotic stresses.
