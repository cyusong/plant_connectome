To gain new insights into the mechanism of soybean (Glycine max) resistance to the soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines), we compared gene expression profiles of developing syncytia in soybean near-isogenic lines differing at Rhg1 (for resistance to Heterodera glycines), a major quantitative trait locus for resistance, by coupling laser capture microdissection with microarray analysis. Gene expression profiling revealed that 1,447 genes were differentially expressed between the two lines. Of these, 241 (16.8%) were stress- and defense-related genes. Several stress-related genes were up-regulated in the resistant line, including those encoding homologs of enzymes that lead to increased levels of reactive oxygen species and proteins associated with the unfolded protein response. These results indicate that syncytia induced in the resistant line are undergoing severe oxidative stress and imbalanced endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, both of which likely contribute to the resistance reaction. Defense-related genes up-regulated within syncytia of the resistant line included those predominantly involved in apoptotic cell death, the plant hypersensitive response, and salicylic acid-mediated defense signaling; many of these genes were either partially suppressed or not induced to the same level by a virulent soybean cyst nematode population for successful nematode reproduction and development on the resistant line. Our study demonstrates that a network of molecular events take place during Rhg1-mediated resistance, leading to a highly complex defense response against a root pathogen.
