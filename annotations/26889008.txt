['26889008', 'Plant NB-LRR proteins confer resistance to multiple pathogens, including viruses.  Although the recognition of viruses by NB-LRR proteins is highly specific,  previous studies have suggested that NB-LRR activation results in a response that  targets all viruses in the infected cell. Using an inducible system to activate  NB-LRR defenses, we find that NB-LRR signaling does not result in the degradation  of viral transcripts, but rather prevents them from associating with ribosomes  and translating their genetic material. This indicates that defense against  viruses involves the repression of viral RNA translation. This repression is  specific to viral transcripts and does not involve a global shutdown of host cell  translation. As a consequence of the repression of viral RNA translation, NB-LRR  responses induce a dramatic increase in the biogenesis of RNA processing bodies  (PBs). We demonstrate that other pathways that induce translational repression,  such as UV irradiation and RNAi, also induce PBs. However, by investigating the  phosphorylation status of eIF2alpha and by using suppressors of RNAi we show that the  mechanisms leading to PB induction by NB-LRR signaling are different from these  stimuli, thus defining a distinct type of translational control and anti-viral  mechanism in plants.', '2016 Apr', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erw042', 'Moffett']
