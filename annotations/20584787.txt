Cytokinins regulate chloroplast differentiation and functioning, but their targets in plastids are not known. In this connection, the plastid localization of the 70 kDa cytokinin-binding protein (CBP70) was studied immunocytochemically in 4-d-old etiolated maize seedlings (Zea mays L., cv. Elbrus) using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CBP70 recognizing this protein not only in nuclei and cytoplasm, but also in plastids. CBP70 was detected in the amyloplasts of the root cap and etioplasts of the mesocotyl, stem apex, and leaves encircling the stem axis in the node. Immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated CBP70 localization in amyloplasts outside starch grains and revealed a dependence of CBP70 content in etioplasts on the degree of their inner membrane differentiation: the low CBP70 amount in etioplasts at the early stages of membrane development, the high content in etioplasts with actively developing membranes, and a considerable decrease in plastids with the formed prolamellar body. This suggests that CBP70 is involved in etioplast structure development. CBP70 was also observed in chloroplasts of the bundle sheath of green maize leaves. CBP70 purified from etioplasts mediated trans-zeatin-dependent activation of transcription elongation in vitro in the transcription systems of maize etioplasts and barley chloroplasts, suggesting that CBP70 is a plastid transcription elongation factor or a modulator of plastid elongation factor activity. CBP70 involvement in the cytokinin-dependent regulation of plastid transcription elongation could be essential for the cytokinin control of the biogenesis of this organelle.
