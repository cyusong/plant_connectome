['11115897', 'Ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs) are a family of unique hydrolases that  specifically remove polypeptides covalently linked via peptide or isopeptide  bonds to the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin. UBPs help regulate the  ubiquitin/26S proteolytic pathway by generating free ubiquitin monomers from  their initial translational products, recycling ubiquitins during the breakdown  of ubiquitin-protein conjugates, and/or by removing ubiquitin from specific  targets and thus presumably preventing target degradation. Here, we describe a  family of 27 UBP genes from Arabidopsis that contain both the conserved cysteine  (Cys) and histidine boxes essential for catalysis. They can be clustered into 14  subfamilies based on sequence similarity, genomic organization, and alignments  with their closest relatives from other organisms, with seven subfamilies having  two or more members. Recombinant AtUBP2 functions as a bona fide UBP: It can  release polypeptides attached to ubiquitins via either alpha- or epsilon-amino  linkages by an activity that requires the predicted active-site Cys within the  Cys box. From the analysis of T-DNA insertion mutants, we demonstrate that the  AtUBP1 and 2 subfamily helps confer resistance to the arginine analog canavanine.  This phenotype suggests that the AtUBP1 and 2 enzymes are needed for abnormal  protein turnover in Arabidopsis.', '2000 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.124.4.1828', 'Vierstra']
