Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient for plants and profoundly affects crop yields and qualities. Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> ) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ) are major inorganic N forms absorbed by plants from the surrounding environments. Intriguingly, NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> is usually toxic to plants when it serves as the sole or dominant N source. It is thus important for plants to coordinate the utilization of NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and the alleviation of NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> toxicity. To fully decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying how plants minimize NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> toxicity may broadly benefit agricultural practice. In the current minireview, we attempt to discuss recent discoveries in the strategies for mitigating NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> toxicity in plants, which may provide potential solutions for improving the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and stress adaptions in crops.
