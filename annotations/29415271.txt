Secretory proteins undergo modifications such as glycosylation and disulphide bond formation before proper folding, and move to their final destination via the endomembrane system. Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to suboptimal environmental conditions triggers a response called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which induces a set of genes that elevate protein folding capacity in the ER. This review aims to establish a connection among ER stress, UPR, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which remains an unexplored topic in plants. For this, we focused on mechanisms of ROS production originating from ER stress, the interaction between ER stress and overall ROS signalling process in the cell, and the interaction of ER stress with other organellar ROS signalling pathways such as of the mitochondria and chloroplasts. The roles of the UPR during plant hormone signalling and abiotic and biotic stress responses are also discussed in connection with redox and ROS signalling.
