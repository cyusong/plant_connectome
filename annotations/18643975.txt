['18643975', 'Leaf veins form a closed network that transports essential photosynthates, water  and signaling molecules to the developing plant. The formation of the patterns of  these networks during leaf ontogeny is an active subject of modeling and computer  simulation. To investigate the vein patterning process, we performed screens for  defects in juvenile leaf vein patterning in Arabidopsis thaliana lines subjected  to mutagenesis via diepoxybutane, activation tagging or the  Dissociation/Activator transposon. We identified over 40 vein pattern defective  lines, providing a phenotypic resource for the testing of vein patterning models.  In addition, we report the chromosomal linkage for 13 of these, eight of which  were successfully cloned. We further describe the phenotypes of five of these  mutants, which we call the defectively organized tributaries (dot) mutants, and  their corresponding molecular identities. The diversity of the individual genes  affected in this collection of pattern mutants suggests that vein pattern is  highly sensitive to perturbations in many cellular processes. Despite this  diversity of causes, the resulting pattern defects fall into a limited number of  classes, including parallel, spurred, misaligned, open, midvein gap and  irregularly spaced. These classes may represent sensitivities to cellular  processes associated with the DOT genes. The ontogeny of common defective  patterns should be accommodated into any robust model for the ontogeny and  evolution of pattern.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03595.x', 'Nelson']
