Systemic immunity triggered by local plant-microbe interactions is studied as systemic acquired resistance (SAR) or induced systemic resistance (ISR) depending on the site of induction and the lifestyle of the inducing microorganism. SAR is induced by pathogens interacting with leaves, whereas ISR is induced by beneficial microbes interacting with roots. Although salicylic acid (SA) is a central component of SAR, additional signals exclusively promote systemic and not local immunity. These signals cooperate in SAR- and possibly also ISR-associated signaling networks that regulate systemic immunity. The non-SA SAR pathway is driven by pipecolic acid or its presumed bioactive derivative N-hydroxy-pipecolic acid. This pathway further regulates inter-plant defense propagation through volatile organic compounds that are emitted by SAR-induced plants and recognized as defense cues by neighboring plants. Both SAR and ISR influence phytohormone crosstalk towards enhanced defense against pathogens, which at the same time affects the composition of the plant microbiome. This potentially leads to further changes in plant defense, plant-microbe, and plant-plant interactions. Therefore, we propose that such inter-organismic interactions could be combined in potentially highly effective plant protection strategies.
