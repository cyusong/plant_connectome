['27317676', 'Plasma membrane-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as FLAGELLIN  SENSING2 (FLS2), EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR), and CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE1  (CERK1) recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) to activate  pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). A reverse genetics approach on genes responsive  to the priming agent beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) revealed IMPAIRED OOMYCETE  SUSCEPTIBILITY1 (IOS1) as a critical PTI player. Arabidopsis thaliana ios1  mutants were hypersusceptible to Pseudomonas syringae bacteria. Accordingly, ios1  mutants showed defective PTI responses, notably delayed upregulation of the PTI  marker gene FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1, reduced callose deposition, and  mitogen-activated protein kinase activation upon MAMP treatment. Moreover,  Arabidopsis lines overexpressing IOS1 were more resistant to bacteria and showed  a primed PTI response. In vitro pull-down, bimolecular fluorescence  complementation, coimmunoprecipitation, and mass spectrometry analyses supported  the existence of complexes between the membrane-localized IOS1 and  BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 (BAK1)-dependent PRRs FLS2 and  EFR, as well as with the BAK1-independent PRR CERK1. IOS1 also associated with  BAK1 in a ligand-independent manner and positively regulated FLS2-BAK1 complex  formation upon MAMP treatment. In addition, IOS1 was critical for chitin-mediated  PTI. Finally, ios1 mutants were defective in BABA-induced resistance and priming.  This work reveals IOS1 as a novel regulatory protein of FLS2-, EFR-, and  CERK1-mediated signaling pathways that primes PTI activation.', '2016 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00313', 'Zimmerli']
