The roles of plant roots are not merely limited to the provision of mechanical support, nutrients and water, but also include more specific roles, such as the capacity to secrete diverse chemical substances. These metabolites are actively secreted in the near root and play specific and significant functions in plant defense and communication. In this review, we detail the various preventive roles of these powerful substances in the rhizosphere with a perspective as to how plants recruit microbes as a preventive measure against other pathogenic microbes, also, briefly about how the rhizosphere can repel insect pests, and how these chemical substances alter microbial dynamics and enhance symbiotic relationships. We also highlight the need for more research in this area to detail the mode of action and quantification of these compounds in the environment and their roles in some important biological processes in microorganisms and plants.
