<i>Bacillus velezensis</i> TH-1 is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria with biocontrol potential that was isolated from the rhizosphere of <i>Sophora tonkinensis</i> Radix<i>.</i> Our previous results showed that strain TH-1 demonstrated effective biocontrol activity against root rot of <i>Sophora tonkinensis</i> Radix and bacterial wilt of ginger. Currently, only a few whole-genome sequences of biocontrol strains isolated from the rhizosphere of medicinal plants are available. We report, here, the complete genome sequence of <i>B. velezensis</i> TH-1. The size of TH-1 genome is 3,929,846 bp that consists of 3,900 genes with a total GC content of 46.48%. The strain TH-1 genome has 3,661 coding genes, 86 transfer RNAs, 27 ribosomal RNAs, and 16 small RNAs. Moreover, we identified nine gene clusters coding for the biosynthesis of antimicrobial compounds. The genomic information of TH-1 will provide resources for the study of biological control mechanisms and plant-microbe interactions. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).
