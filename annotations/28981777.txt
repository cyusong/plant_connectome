Resolving the drivers of hydraulic decline during drought is crucial for understanding drought tolerance in crops and natural ecosystems. In the past 15 years, studies of the decline of leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) have supported a major role in controlling plant drought responses. We analyzed the variation in Kleaf decline with dehydration in a global database of 310 species, providing novel insights into its underlying mechanisms, its co-ordination with stem hydraulics, its influence on gas exchange and drought tolerance, and its linkage with species ecological distributions. Kleaf vulnerability varied strongly within and across lineages, growth forms, and biomes. A critical literature review indicates that changes in hydraulic conductance outside the xylem with dehydration drive the overall decline of Kleaf. We demonstrate a significant leaf hydraulic safety-efficiency trade-off across angiosperm species and discuss the importance of the large variation around this trend. Leaves tend to be more vulnerable than stems, with their vulnerabilities co-ordinated across species, and importantly linked with adaptation across biomes. We hypothesize a novel framework to explain diversity across species in the co-ordination of Kleaf and gas exchange during dehydration. These findings reflect considerable recent progress, yet new tools for measurement, visualization, and modeling will result in ongoing discoveries important across fields in plant biology.
