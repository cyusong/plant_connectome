['21105921', 'Stomata are vital for the adaptation of plants to abiotic stress, and in turn  stomatal density is modulated by environmental factors. Less clear, however, is  whether regulators of stomatal development themselves participate in the sensing  or response of stomata to abiotic stress. FOUR LIPS (FLP) and its paralog MYB88  encode MYB proteins that establish stomatal patterning by permitting only a  single symmetric division before stomata differentiate. Hence, flp-1 myb88 double  mutants have an excess of stomata, which are often misplaced in direct contact.  Here, we investigate the consequences of loss of FLP/MYB88 function on the  ability of Arabidopsis plants to respond to abiotic stress. While flp-1 myb88  double mutants are viable and display no obvious aerial phenotypes under normal  greenhouse growth conditions, we show that flp-1 myb88 plants are significantly  more susceptible to drought and high salt, and have increased rates of water  loss. To determine whether flp-1 myb88 plants are already challenged under normal  growth conditions, we compared genome-wide transcript levels between flp-1 myb88  and wild-type green tissues. Unexpectedly, uninduced flp-1 myb88 plants showed a  reduced accumulation of many typical abiotic stress gene transcripts. Moreover,  the induction of many of these stress genes under high-salt conditions was  significantly lower in flp-1 myb88 plants. Our results provide evidence for a new  function of FLP/MYB88 in sensing and/or transducing abiotic stress, which is  severely compromised in flp-1 myb88 mutants.', '2010 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04364.x', 'Grotewold']
