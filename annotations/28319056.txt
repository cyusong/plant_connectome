['28319056', 'Plants uptake nitrogen (N) from the soil mainly in the form of nitrate. However,  nitrate is often distributed heterogeneously in natural soil. Plants, therefore,  have a systemic long-distance signalling mechanism by which N starvation on one  side of the root leads to a compensatory N uptake on the other N-rich side(1,2).  This systemic N acquisition response is triggered by a root-to-shoot mobile  peptide hormone, C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE (CEP), originating from the  N-starved roots(3,4), but the molecular nature of the descending shoot-to-root  signal remains elusive. Here, we show that phloem-specific polypeptides that are  induced in leaves upon perception of root-derived CEP act as descending  long-distance mobile signals translocated to each root. These shoot-derived  polypeptides, which we named CEP DOWNSTREAM 1 (CEPD1) and CEPD2, upregulate the  expression of the nitrate transporter gene NRT2.1 in roots specifically when  nitrate is present in the rhizosphere. Arabidopsis plants deficient in this  pathway show impaired systemic N acquisition response accompanied with  N-deficiency symptoms. These fundamental mechanistic insights should provide a  conceptual framework for understanding systemic nutrient acquisition responses in  plants.', '2017 Mar 20', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/nplants.2017.29', 'ORCID:']
