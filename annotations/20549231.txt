A combination of enzyme mapping, FT-IR microscopy and NMR spectroscopy was used to study temporal and spatial aspects of endosperm cell wall synthesis and deposition in developing grain of bread wheat cv. Hereward. This confirmed previous reports that changes in the proportions of the two major groups of cell wall polysaccharides occur, with beta-glucan accumulating earlier in development than arabinoxylan. Changes in the structure of the arabinoxylan occurred, with decreased proportions of disubstituted xylose residues and increased proportions of monosubstituted xylose residues. These are likely to result, at least in part, from arabinoxylan restructuring catalysed by enzymes such as arabinoxylan arabinofurano hydrolase and lead to changes in cell wall mechanical properties which may be required to withstand stresses during grain maturation and desiccation.
