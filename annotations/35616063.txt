The plant-specific <i>TCP</i> transcription factor plays important roles in plant development and environment adaptation. <i>Setaria italica</i> and <i>Setaria viridis</i>, the C4 model plants, can grow on drought or arid soils. However, there is no systematic information about the genomic dissection and the expression of <i>Setaria TCP</i> genes. A total of 22 <i>TCP</i> genes were both identified from <i>S. italica</i> and <i>S. viridis</i> genomes. They all contained bHLH domain and were grouped into three main clades (PCF, CIN, and CYC/TB1). The <i>TCP</i> genes in the same clades shared similar gene structures. Cis-element in the <i>TCP</i> promoter regions were analyzed and associated with hormones and stress responsiveness. Ten <i>TCP</i> genes were predicted to be targets of miRNA319. Moreover, gene ontology analysis indicated three Si<i>TCP</i> and three <i>SvTCP</i> genes were involved in the regulation of shoot development, and <i>SiTCP16/SvTCP16</i> were clustered together with tillering controlling gene <i>TB1</i>. The <i>TCP</i> genes were differentially expressed in the organs, but <i>SiTCP/SvTCP</i> orthologs shared similar expression patterns. Ten <i>SiTCP</i> members were downregulated under drought or salinity stresses, indicating they may play regulatory roles in abiotic stresses. The study provides detailed information regarding <i>Setaria TCP</i> genes, providing the theoretical basis for agricultural applications.
