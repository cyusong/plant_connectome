['19095900', 'Selection pressure exerted by insects and microorganisms shapes the diversity of  plant secondary metabolites. We identified a metabolic pathway for  glucosinolates, known insect deterrents, that differs from the pathway activated  by chewing insects. This pathway is active in living plant cells, may contribute  to glucosinolate turnover, and has been recruited for broad-spectrum antifungal  defense responses. The Arabidopsis CYP81F2 gene encodes a P450 monooxygenase that  is essential for the pathogen-induced accumulation of  4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate, which in turn is activated by the  atypical PEN2 myrosinase (a type of beta-thioglucoside glucohydrolase) for  antifungal defense. We propose that reiterated enzymatic cycles, controlling the  generation of toxic molecules and their detoxification, enable the recruitment of  glucosinolates in defense responses.', '2009 Jan 2', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1163732', 'Schulze-Lefert']
