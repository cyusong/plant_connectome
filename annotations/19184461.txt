Many microorganisms interact with plants but information is insufficient concerning requirements for plant colonization and if interactions become beneficial or detrimental. Pretreatment of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) with Bacillus results in disease suppression upon challenge with pathogens. We have studied transcriptome effects on oilseed rape primed with the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 5113 biocontrol strain and compared that with effects of the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Using the cDNA-AFLP technique 21,700 transcript fragments were obtained of which 120 were differentially expressed and verified by northern blot analysis for selected transcripts. Priming with Bacillus caused greater effect on leaf than root transcripts where sequencing and BLAST analysis suggested many of the transcripts to be involved in metabolism and bioenergy. Bacillus and Botrytis treatment also changed metabolic gene expression in addition to signaling and transcription control genes as well as a potential disease resistance (TIR-NBS-LRR) gene. The pathogen provoked non-primed plant profile was less dominated by metabolism than Bacillus and Bacillus-Botrytis treated plants. Several transcripts were homologues to unknown genes in the different treatments. Altogether Bacillus treatment of roots cause a systemic gene expression in leaves suggested to result in a metabolic reprogramming as a major event during priming.

Bacillus: !primed! oilseed rape
Bacillus: !caused! greater effect on leaf than root transcripts
Bacillus: !changed! metabolic gene expression
Botrytis: !provoked! non-primed plant profile
Bacillus: !resulted in! metabolic reprogramming
