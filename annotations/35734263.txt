Agronomic traits such as plant height (PH), leaf number (LN), leaf length (LL), and leaf width (LW), which are closely related to yield and quality, are important in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> L.). To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with agronomic traits in tobacco, 209 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and 537 multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) lines were developed. The biparental RIL and MAGIC lines were genotyped using a 430 K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip assay, and their agronomic traits were repeatedly evaluated under different conditions. A total of 43 QTLs associated with agronomic traits were identified through a combination of linkage mapping (LM) and association mapping (AM) methods. Among these 43 QTLs, three major QTLs, namely <i>qPH13-3, qPH17-1</i>, and <i>qLW20-1</i>, were repeatedly identified by the use of various genetically diverse populations across different environments. The candidate genes for these major QTLs were subsequently predicted. Validation and utilization of the major QTL <i>qLW20-1</i> for the improvement of LW in tobacco were investigated. These results could be applied to molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) for breeding important agronomic traits in tobacco.
