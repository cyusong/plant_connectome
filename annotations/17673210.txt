['17673210', 'The lack of trehalose accumulation in most plant species has been partly  attributed to the presence of an active trehalase. Although trehalose synthesis  enzymes are thought to be cytosolic, and previous studies have indicated that  trehalase activity is extracellular, the exact location of the enzyme has not yet  been established in plant cell. We present evidence that the yet uncharacterised  full-length Arabidopsis trehalase is a plasma membrane-bound protein, probably  anchored to the membrane through a predicted N-terminal membrane spanning domain.  The full-length AtTRE1, when expressed in yeast can functionally substitute for  the extracellularly active trehalase Ath1p, by sustaining the growth of an ath1  null mutant strain on trehalose and at pH 4.8. We further demonstrate that AtTRE1  expressed in yeast is plasma membrane-bound as in plant cell. In light of these  findings, the regulation of plant cell endogenous trehalose by trehalase is  discussed.', '2007 Aug 21', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2007.07.036', 'Batoko']
