Flavor is an important quality of mature tomato fruits. Compared with heirloom tomatoes, modern commercial tomato cultivars are considerably less flavorful. This study aimed to compare the flavor of 71 tomato accessions (8 pink cherry, PC; 11 red cherry, RC; 15 pink large-fruited, PL; and 37 red large-fruited, RL) using hedonism scores and odor activity values. Taste compounds were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography. Volatiles were detected using gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry. The flavor of tomato accessions can be evaluated using the DTOPSIS analysis method. According to the results of DTOPSIS analysis, 71 tomato accessions can be divided into 4 classes. Tomato accessions PL11, PC4, PC2, PC8, RL35, RC6, and RC10 had better flavor; accessions PC4, PC8, RC10, RL2, and RL35 had better tomato taste; and accessions PL11, PC2, and RC6 had better tomato odor. The concentrations of total soluble solids, fructose, glucose, and citric acid were shown to positively contribute to tomato taste. Tomato odor was mainly derived from 15 volatiles, namely, 1-hexanol, (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexen-1-ol, hexanal, (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenal, (<i>E</i>)-2-heptenal, (<i>E</i>)-2-octenal, (<i>E,E</i>)-2,4-decadienal, (<i>Z</i>)-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadieal, 2,6,6-timethyl-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde, (2E)-3-(3-pentyl-2-oxiranyl)acrylaldehyde, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, (<i>E</i>)-6,10-dimetyl-5,9-undecadien-2-one, methyl salicylate, 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol, and 2-isobutylthiazole. Significant positive correlations (<i>P</i> < 0.05) were detected between the compound concentrations and flavor scores. The above-mentioned compounds can be used as parameters for the evaluation of flavor characteristics and as potential targets to improve the flavor quality of tomato varieties.
