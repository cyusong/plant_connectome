AGAMOUS (AG) subfamily genes regulate the floral organs initiation and development, fruit and seed development. At present, there has been insufficient study of the function of AG subfamily genes in Asteraceae. Marigold (Tagetes erecta) belongs to Asteraceae family whose unique inflorescence structure makes it an important research target for understanding floral organ development in plants. Four AG subfamily genes of marigold were isolated and phylogenetically grouped into class C (TeAG1 and TeAG2) and class D (TeAGL11-1 and TeAGL11-2) genes. Expression profile analysis demonstrated that these four genes were highly expressed in reproductive organs of marigold. Subcellular localization analysis suggested that all these four proteins were located in the nucleus. Protein-protein interactions analysis indicated that class C proteins had a wider interaction manner than class D proteins. Function analysis of ectopic expression in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that TeAG1 displayed a C function specifying the stamen identity and carpel identity, and that TeAGL11-1 exhibited a D function regulating seed development and petal development. In addition, overexpression of both TeAG1 and TeAGL11-1 leaded to curling rosette leaf and early flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. This study provides an insight into molecular mechanism of AG subfamily genes in Asteraceae species and technical support for improvement of several floral traits.

TeAG1: !specifies! stamen identity and carpel identity
TeAGL11-1: !regulates! seed development and petal development
TeAG1: !leads to! curling rosette leaf and early flowering
TeAGL11-1: !leads to! curling rosette leaf and early flowering
