Flamholz and Shih explain how photosynthetic organisms on earth have evolved carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms to contend with an increased abundance of oxygen in the atmosphere. This critical innovation has occurred numerous times and comes in two basic flavors.

Gene: !affects! Carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms 
Gene: !localizes to! Photosynthetic organisms 
Gene: !enhances! Abundance of oxygen in the atmosphere 
Gene: !represses! Increased abundance of oxygen in the atmosphere 
Gene: !synthesizes! Two basic flavors
