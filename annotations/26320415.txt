['26320415', 'The two-helix light harvesting like (Lil) protein Lil3 belongs to the family of  chlorophyll binding light harvesting proteins of photosynthetic membranes. A  function in tetrapyrrol synthesis and stabilization of geranylgeraniol reductase  has been shown. Lil proteins contain the chlorophyll a/b-binding motif; however,  binding of chlorophyll has not been demonstrated. We find that Lil3.2 from  Arabidopsis thaliana forms heterodimers with Lil3.1 and binds chlorophyll. Lil3.2  heterodimerization (25+/-7.8 nM) is favored relative to homodimerization (431+/-59  nM). Interaction of Lil3.2 with chlorophyll a (231+/-49 nM) suggests that  heterodimerization precedes binding of chlorophyll in Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2015 Oct 7', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2015.08.023', 'Eichacker']
