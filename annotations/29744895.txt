Mesophyll conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> (g<sub>m</sub> ), a key photosynthetic trait, is strongly constrained by leaf anatomy. Leaf anatomical parameters such as cell wall thickness and chloroplast area exposed to the mesophyll intercellular airspace have been demonstrated to determine g<sub>m</sub> in species with diverging phylogeny, leaf structure and ontogeny. However, the potential implication of leaf anatomy, especially chloroplast movement, on the short-term response of g<sub>m</sub> to rapid changes (i.e. seconds to minutes) under different environmental conditions (CO<sub>2</sub> , light or temperature) has not been examined. The aim of this study was to determine whether the observed rapid variations of g<sub>m</sub> in response to variations of light and CO<sub>2</sub> could be explained by changes in any leaf anatomical arrangements. When compared to high light and ambient CO<sub>2</sub> , the values of g<sub>m</sub> estimated by chlorophyll fluorescence decreased under high CO<sub>2</sub> and increased at low CO<sub>2</sub> , while it decreased with decreasing light. Nevertheless, no changes in anatomical parameters, including chloroplast distribution, were found. Hence, the g<sub>m</sub> estimated by analytical models based on anatomical parameters was constant under varying light and CO<sub>2</sub> . Considering this discrepancy between anatomy and chlorophyll fluorescence estimates, it is concluded that apparent fast g<sub>m</sub> variations should be due to artefacts in its estimation and/or to changes in the biochemical components acting on diffusional properties of the leaf (e.g. aquaporins and carbonic anhydrase).
