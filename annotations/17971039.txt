['17971039', 'Leaf senescence is the final stage of leaf development and is finely regulated  via a complex genetic regulatory network incorporating both developmental and  environmental factors. In an effort to identify negative regulators of leaf  senescence, we screened activation-tagged Arabidopsis lines for mutants that  exhibit a delayed leaf senescence phenotype. One of the mutants (ore7-1D) showed  a highly significant delay of leaf senescence in the heterozygous state, leading  to at least a twofold increase in leaf longevity. The activated gene (ORE7/ESC)  encoded a protein with an AT-hook DNA-binding motif; such proteins are known to  co-regulate transcription of genes through modification of chromatin  architecture. We showed that ORE7/ESC, in addition to binding to a plant AT-rich  DNA fragment, could also modify the chromatin architecture, as illustrated by an  altered distribution of a histone-GFP fusion protein in the nucleus of the  mutant. Globally altered gene expression, shown by microarray analysis, also  indicated that activation of ORE7/ESC results in a younger condition in the  mutant leaves. We propose that ectopically expressed ORE7/ESC is negatively  regulating leaf senescence and suggest that the resulting chromatin alteration  may have a role in controlling leaf longevity. Interestingly, activation of  ORE7/ESC also led to a highly extended post-harvest storage life.', '2007 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03317.x', 'Nam']
