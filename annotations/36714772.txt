Pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in plants is mediated by cell surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) upon perception of microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMPs). MAMPs are conserved molecules across microbe species, or even kingdoms, and PRRs can confer broad-spectrum disease resistance. Pep-13/25 are well-characterized MAMPs in <i>Phytophthora</i> species, which are renowned devastating oomycete pathogens of potato and other plants, and for which genetic resistance is highly wanted. Pep-13/25 are derived from a 42 kDa transglutaminase GP42, but their cognate PRR has remained unknown. Here, we genetically mapped a novel surface immune receptor that recognizes Pep-25. By using effectoromics screening, we characterized the recognition spectrum of Pep-13/25 in diverse Solanaceae species. Response to Pep-13/25 was predominantly found in potato and related wild tuber-bearing Solanum species. Bulk-segregant RNA sequencing (BSR-Seq) and genetic mapping the response to Pep-25 led to a 0.081 cM region on the top of chromosome 3 in the wild potato species <i>Solanum microdontum</i> subsp. <i>gigantophyllum</i>. Some BAC clones in this region were isolated and sequenced, and we found the Pep-25 receptor locates in a complex receptor-like kinase (<i>RLK</i>) locus. This study is an important step toward the identification of the Pep-13/25 receptor, which can potentially lead to broad application in potato and various other hosts of <i>Phytophthora</i> species.
