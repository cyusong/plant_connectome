['11154345', 'It is generally accepted that cytokinin oxidases, which oxidatively remove  cytokinin side chains to produce adenine and the corresponding isopentenyl  aldehyde, play a major role in regulating cytokinin levels in planta. Partially  purified fractions of cytokinin oxidase from various species have been studied  for many years, but have yet to clearly reveal the properties of the enzyme or to  define its biological significance. Details of the genomic organization of the  recently isolated maize (Zea mays) cytokinin oxidase gene (ckx1) and some of its  Arabidopsis homologs are now presented. Expression of an intronless ckx1 in  Pichia pastoris allowed production of large amounts of recombinant cytokinin  oxidase and facilitated detailed kinetic and cofactor analysis and comparison  with the native enzyme. The enzyme is a flavoprotein containing covalently bound  flavin adenine dinucleotide, but no detectable heavy metals. Expression of the  oxidase in maize tissues is described.', '2001 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.125.1.378', 'Morris']
