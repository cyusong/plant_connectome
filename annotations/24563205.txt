['24563205', 'CULLIN4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRL4s) regulate key developmental and stress  responses in eukaryotes. Studies in both animals and plants have led to the  identification of many CRL4 targets as well as specific regulatory mechanisms  that modulate their function. The latter involve COP10-DET1-DDB1 (CDD)-related  complexes, which have been proposed to facilitate target recognition by CRL4,  although the molecular basis for this activity remains largely unknown. Here, we  provide evidence that Arabidopsis thaliana DET1-, DDB1-ASSOCIATED1 (DDA1), as  part of the CDD complex, provides substrate specificity for CRL4 by interacting  with ubiquitination targets. Thus, we show that DDA1 binds to the abscisic acid  (ABA) receptor PYL8, as well as PYL4 and PYL9, in vivo and facilitates its  proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, we found that DDA1 negatively regulates  ABA-mediated developmental responses, including inhibition of seed germination,  seedling establishment, and root growth. All other CDD components displayed a  similar regulatory function, although they did not directly interact with PYL8.  Interestingly, DDA1-mediated destabilization of PYL8 is counteracted by ABA,  which protects PYL8 by limiting its polyubiquitination. Altogether, our data  establish a function for DDA1 as a substrate receptor for CRL4-CDD complexes and  uncover a mechanism for the desensitization of ABA signaling based on the  regulation of ABA receptor stability.', '2014 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.122234', 'Rubio']
