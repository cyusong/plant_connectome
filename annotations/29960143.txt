The influence of molybdenum, tungsten on germination and growth of barley Hordeum vulgare L. was studied. Results of this study revealed the differential effect of heavy metals on seedlings growth. Exogenous molybdenum treatment stimulated the growth of seedlings. The addition of the metal significantly stimulated root elongation. Contrastingly, the addition of tungsten resulted in increased seed germination and inhibits the growth of seedlings. The negative effect of tungsten on the growth of barley was more profound for roots of plants. In addition, the influence of metals on the growth of plants was also tested in saline conditions. It is shown that under salinity stress plant growth drastically decreased in presence of tungsten. Results of this study showed that activity of molybdenum-containing aldehyde oxidase (AO; EC 1.2.3.1) was also significantly affected by metals. The activity of AO in leaves and roots enhanced with increasing concentrations of molybdate, while tungstate treatment inhibited the enzyme activity. Perhaps, the differential influence of molybdenum and tungsten on the growth of barley is a direct effect of metals on aldehyde oxidase activity in plants. Moreover, the intense negative effect of tungsten treatment on barley growth under salinity conditions emphasizes an important role of aldehyde oxidase in plant resistance to stress factors.
