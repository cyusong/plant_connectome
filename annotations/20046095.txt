In the past, studies have shown that plants do indeed have the ability to recognize other plants in their surroundings based on relatedness and identity. Although, mechanisms for these recognitions have been proposed, to date, one has not been supported. In our recent work, we showed that Arabidopsis plants distinguish self/non self or kin/stranger plants through secretion and by recognition of root secretions. Additionally, we show that this kin response can be eliminated through treatment with a root secretion inhibitor and that the kin recognition response is robust through several Arabidopsis accessions. We hope that this study can promote the understanding of root secretion and its numerous roles in rhizosphere communications.
