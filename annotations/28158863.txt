Rice grain chalkiness is a highly complex trait involved in multiple metabolic pathways and controlled by polygenes and growth conditions. To uncover novel aspects of chalkiness formation, we performed an integrated profiling of gene activity in the developing grains of a notched-belly rice mutant. Using exhaustive tandem mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics and whole-genome RNA sequencing to generate a nearly complete catalog of expressed mRNAs and proteins, we reliably identified 38,476 transcripts and 3,840 proteins. Comparison between the translucent part and chalky part of the notched-belly grains resulted in only a few differently express genes (240) and differently express proteins (363), thus making it possible to focus on 'core' genes or common pathways. Several novel key pathways were identified as of relevance to chalkiness formation, in particular the shift of C and N metabolism, the down-regulation of ribosomal proteins and the resulting low abundance of storage proteins especially the 13 kDa prolamin subunit, and the suppressed photosynthetic capacity in the pericarp of the chalky part. Further, genes and proteins as transporters for carbohydrates, amino acid/peptides, proteins, lipids and inorganic ions showed an increasing expression pattern in the chalky part of the notched-belly grains. Similarly, transcripts and proteins of receptors for auxin, ABA, ethylene and brassinosteroid were also up-regulated. In summary, this joint analysis of transcript and protein profiles provides a comprehensive reference map of gene activity regarding the physiological state in the chalky endosperm.
