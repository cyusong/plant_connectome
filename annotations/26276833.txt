Peptides fulfill a plethora of functions in plant growth, development, and stress responses. They act as key components of cell-to-cell communication, interfere with signaling and response pathways, or display antimicrobial activity. Strikingly, both the diversity and amount of plant peptides have been largely underestimated. Most characterized plant peptides to date acting as small signaling peptides or antimicrobial peptides are derived from nonfunctional precursor proteins. However, evidence is emerging on peptides derived from a functional protein, directly translated from small open reading frames (without the involvement of a precursor) or even encoded by primary transcripts of microRNAs. These novel types of peptides further add to the complexity of the plant peptidome, even though their number is still limited and functional characterization as well as translational evidence are often controversial. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the reported types of plant peptides, including their described functional and structural properties. We propose a novel, unifying peptide classification system to emphasize the enormous diversity in peptide synthesis and consequent complexity of the still expanding knowledge on the plant peptidome.
