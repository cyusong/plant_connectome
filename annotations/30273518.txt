Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase 6 (MKK6) has previously been shown to play important roles in plant immunity and cytokinesis. Here we report that it is also involved in the negative regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Elevated anthocyanin levels are observed in mkk6 knock out mutant plants. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that the expression level of MYB75 (Myb transcription factor 75), which encodes a key positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis, is up-regulated in mkk6 mutant plants, suggesting that increased MYB75 expression contributes to the elevated anthocyanin levels. In addition, suppression of high sucrose-induced anthocyanin production by pathogen associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity is also dependent on MKK6, further supporting that MKK6 is a key negative regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.
