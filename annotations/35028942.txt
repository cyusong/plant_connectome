Resource-use strategies are hypothesized to evolve along climatic gradients. However, our understanding of the environmental factors driving divergent evolution of resource-use strategies and the relationship between trait genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity is far from complete. Using the Mediterranean tree Quercus faginea as study system, we tested the hypothesis that a conservative resource-use strategy with increased drought tolerance and reduced phenotypic plasticity has evolved in areas with longer and more severe dry seasons. We conducted a glasshouse experiment in which we measured leaf morphological, physiological, growth and allocation traits in seedlings from 10 range-wide climatically contrasting populations, grown under two different watering treatments. Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed a genetic gradient of resource-use strategies and phenotypic plasticity associated with provenance climate. In particular, populations from harsher (drier and colder) environments had more sclerophyllous leaves, lower growth rates, better physiological performance under dry conditions and reduced multi-trait phenotypic plasticity compared to populations from more mesic and milder environments. Our results suggest that contrasting precipitation and temperature regimes play an important role in the adaptive intraspecific evolution of multivariate phenotypes and their plasticity, resulting in coordinated morphology, physiology, growth and allometry according to alternative resource-use strategies.
