The appearance of the flower marks a key event in the evolutionary history of plants. Among the four types of floral organs, the gynoecium represents the major adaptive advantage of the flower. The gynoecium is an enclosing structure that protects and facilitates the fertilisation of the ovules, which then mature as seeds. Upon fertilisation, in many species, the gynoecium itself eventually becomes the fruit, which contributes to the dispersal of the seeds. However, despite its importance and the recent advances in our understanding of the genetic regulatory network (GRN) guiding early gynoecium development, many questions remain to be resolved regarding the extent of the conservation of the molecular mechanisms for gynoecium development among different taxa, and how these mechanisms give origin and diversification to the gynoecium. In this review, we compile the existing knowledge about the evolution, development and molecular mechanisms involved in the origin and evolution of the gynoecium.
