Endosidin20 (ES20) was recently identified as a cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor (CBI) that targets the catalytic domain of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE 6 (CESA6) and thus inhibits the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we characterized the effects of ES20 on the growth of other plant species and found that ES20 is a broad-spectrum plant growth inhibitor. We tested the inhibitory effects of previously characterized CBIs (isoxaben, indaziflam and C17) on the growth of Arabidopsis cesa6 mutants that have reduced sensitivity to ES20. We found that most of these mutants are sensitive to isoxaben, indaziflam and C17, indicating that these tested CBIs have a different mode of action than ES20. ES20 also has a synergistic inhibitory effect on plant growth when jointly applied with other CBIs, further confirming that ES20 has a different mode of action than isoxaben, indaziflam and C17. We demonstrated that plants carrying two missense mutations conferring resistance to ES20 and isoxaben can tolerate the dual inhibitory effects of these CBIs when combined. ES20 inhibits Arabidopsis growth in growth medium and in soil following direct spraying. Therefore, our results pave the way for using ES20 as a broad-spectrum herbicide, and for the use of gene-editing technologies to produce ES20-resistant crop plants.
