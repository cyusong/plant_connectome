Nitrate signaling integrates and coordinates the expression of a wide range of genes, metabolic pathways and ultimately, plant growth and development. Calcium signaling is proved to be involved in the primary nitrate response pathway. However, it is much less understood how calcium signaling mediates nitrate sensing and responses from the extracellular space to cytoplasm, then to the nucleus. In this review, we describe how transceptor-channel complex (cyclic nucleotide-gated channel protein 15 interacting with nitrate transceptor, CNGC15-NRT1.1), calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs, CBL1, CBL9), CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs), phospholipase C (PLC) and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs, also CPKs), acting as key players, complete a potential backbone of the nitrate-signaling pathway, from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. NRT1.1 together with CBL1/9-CIPK23 and CBL-CIPK8 links the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> signaling to cytoplasmic and nuclear regulators and triggers downstream NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> responses. PLCs and inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3) connect NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> signaling and cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signature. CPK10/30/32 fill the gap between NRT1.1 and NIN-like protein (NLP) transcription factors. The arabidopsis nitrate regulated1 (ANR1) is induced from the endosome by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CPKs-NLPs signaling pathway activated by the unphosphorylated form of NRT1.1 (NRT1.1 <sup>T101A</sup>) at high nitrate condition. Understanding how calcium signaling interconnects the upstream nitrate sensor complex with downstream multiple sensors of the nitrate-signaling pathway is key to completing the nutrient-growth regulatory networks.
