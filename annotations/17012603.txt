['17012603', 'To test whether tocopherols (vitamin E) are essential in the protection against  oxidative stress in plants, a series of Arabidopsis thaliana vitamin E (vte)  biosynthetic mutants that accumulate different types and levels of tocopherols  and pathway intermediates were analyzed under abiotic stress. Surprisingly subtle  differences were observed between the tocopherol-deficient vte2 mutant and the  wild type during high-light, salinity, and drought stresses. However, vte2, and  to a lesser extent vte1, exhibited dramatic phenotypes under low temperature  (i.e., increased anthocyanin levels and reduced growth and seed production). That  these changes were independent of light level and occurred in the absence of  photoinhibition or lipid peroxidation suggests that the mechanisms involved are  independent of tocopherol functions in photoprotection. Compared with the wild  type, vte1 and vte2 had reduced rates of photoassimilate export as early as 6 h  into low-temperature treatment, increased soluble sugar levels by 60 h, and  increased starch and reduced photosynthetic electron transport rate by 14 d. The  rapid reduction in photoassimilate export in vte2 coincides with callose  deposition exclusively in phloem parenchyma transfer cell walls adjacent to the  companion cell/sieve element complex. Together, these results indicate that  tocopherols have a more limited role in photoprotection than previously assumed  but play crucial roles in low-temperature adaptation and phloem loading.', '2006 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.039404', 'DellaPenna']
