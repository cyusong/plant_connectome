['16083885', "This study analyses the activity of an Arabidopsis thaliana  UDP-glycosyltransferase, UGT71B6 (71B6), towards abscisic acid (ABA) and its  structural analogues. The enzyme preferentially glucosylated ABA and not its  catabolites. The requirement for a specific chiral configuration of (+)-ABA was  demonstrated through the use of analogues with the chiral centre changed or  removed. The enzyme was able to accommodate extra bulk around the double bond of  the ABA ring but not alterations to the 8'- and 9'-methyl groups. Interestingly,  the ketone of ABA was not required for glucosylation. Bioactive analogues,  resistant to 8'-hydroxylation, were also poor substrates for conjugation by  UGT71B6. This suggests the compounds may be resistant to both pathways of ABA  inactivation and may, therefore, prove to be useful agrochemicals for field  applications.", '2005 Aug 15', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2005.06.084', 'Bowles']
