Light regulates growth and developmental processes in plants via global transcriptome adjustment, translational control, and multilayered posttranslational modification of proteins. The transcriptional activation and repression of light-responsive genes has been well documented; however, the impact of posttranscriptional regulation on conveying light signals has been less addressed. Here, we examined whether optimal photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana requires the proper biogenesis of small regulatory RNAs that play pivotal roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Arabidopsis carrying a mutation in HUA ENHANCER1 (HEN1), required for stabilization of small regulatory RNAs, showed defects in multiple aspects of photomorphogenic and skotomorphogenic development. HEN1 negatively regulated Arabidopsis photomorphogenesis. Light-activated HEN1 expression depended on the photoreceptors phytochrome A (phyA), phyB, cryptochrome 1 (cry1), and cry2 and key transcriptional regulators ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and HY5-HOMOLOG. We also demonstrate the involvement of the small regulatory RNAs miR157d and miR319 in modulating the expression of a positive regulator, HY5, and negative regulators TEOSINTE BRANCHED1, CYCLOIDEA AND PCF family proteins, respectively, for optimal photomorphogenic development in Arabidopsis.
