Pear ring rot, caused by <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i>, is one of the most serious diseases in pear. Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) was reported to play a key role in the plant defense response. Here, we found that exogenous calcium could enhance resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> in pear leaves. Less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> but more activated reactive oxygen species scavenge enzymes accumulated in calcium-treated leaves than in H<sub>2</sub>O-treated leaves. Moreover, the increased level of more ascorbic acid-glutathione was maintained by Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment under pathogen infection. The expression of core autophagy-related genes and autophagosome formations were enhanced in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-treated leaves. Silencing of <i>PbrATG5</i> in <i>Pyrus betulaefolia</i> conferred sensitivity to inoculation, which was only slightly recovered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment. Moreover, the salicylic acid (SA) level and SA-related gene expression were induced more strongly by <i>B. dothidea</i> in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-treated leaves than in H<sub>2</sub>O-treated leaves. Taken together, these results demonstrated that exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhanced resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> by increasing autophagic activity and SA accumulation. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in increasing the tolerance of pear to <i>B. dothidea</i> infection.
