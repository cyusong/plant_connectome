['25163803', 'ZAT11, a Zinc Finger of Arabidopsis Thaliana 11, is a dual-function  transcriptional regulator that positively regulates primary root growth but  negatively regulates Ni (2+) tolerance. Zinc Finger of Arabidopsis Thaliana 11  (ZAT11) is a C2H2-type zinc finger protein that has been reported to function as  an active transcriptional repressor. However, the biological function of ZAT11  remains unknown. Here we show that GFP-tagged ZAT11 is targeted to the nucleus.  Analysis of plants expressing ZAT11 promoter-GUS showed that ZAT11 is highly  expressed in roots and particularly in root tips. To identify the biological  function of ZAT11, we constructed three independent lines of ZAT11 overexpressing  transgenic plant (ZAT11 OE). ZAT11 OE enhanced the elongation of primary root but  reduced the metal tolerance against nickel ion (Ni(2+)). The reduced Ni(2+)  tolerance of ZAT11 OE was correlated with decreased accumulation of Ni(2+) in  plants. The decreased accumulation of Ni(2+) in ZAT11 OE was caused by the  reduced transcription of a vacuolar Ni(2+) transporter gene. Taken together, our  results suggest that ZAT11 is a dual function transcriptional regulator that  positively regulates primary root growth but negatively regulates Ni(2+)  tolerance.', '2014 Dec', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-014-1675-7', 'Chung']
