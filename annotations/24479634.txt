Growth is a complex trait that adapts to the prevailing conditions by integrating many internal and external signals. Understanding the molecular origin of this variation remains a challenging issue. In this study, natural variation of shoot growth under mannitol-induced stress was analyzed by standard quantitative trait locus mapping methods in a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the Col-0 and Cvi-0 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Cloning of a major QTL specific to mannitol-induced stress condition led to identification of EGM1 and EGM2, a pair of tandem-duplicated genes encoding receptor-like kinases that are potentially involved in signaling of mannitol-associated stress responses. Using various genetic approaches, we identified two non-synonymous mutations in the EGM2[Cvi] allele that are shared by at least ten accessions from various origins and are probably responsible for a specific tolerance to mannitol. We have shown that the enhanced shoot growth phenotype contributed by the Cvi allele is not linked to generic osmotic properties but instead to a specific chemical property of mannitol itself. This result raises the question of the function of such a gene in A. thaliana, a species that does not synthesize mannitol. Our findings suggest that the receptor-like kinases encoded by EGM genes may be activated by mannitol produced by pathogens such as fungi, and may contribute to plant defense responses whenever mannitol is present.
