['17892446', 'Members of a large family of cellulose synthase-like genes (CSLs) are predicted  to encode glycosyl transferases (GTs) involved in the biosynthesis of plant cell  walls. The CSLA and CSLF families are known to contain mannan and glucan  synthases, respectively, but the products of other CSLs are unknown. Here we  report the effects of disrupting ATCSLD5 expression in Arabidopsis. Both stem and  root growth were significantly reduced in ATCSLD5 knock-out plants, and these  plants also had increased susceptibility to the cellulose synthase inhibitor  isoxaben. Antibody and carbohydrate-binding module labelling indicated a  reduction in the level of xylan in stems, and in vitro GT assays using microsomes  from stems revealed that ATCSLD5 knock-out plants also had reduced xylan and  homogalacturonan synthase activity. Expression in Nicotiana benthamiana of  ATCSLD5 and ATCSLD3, fluorescently tagged at either the C- or the N-terminal,  indicated that these GTs are likely to be localized in the Golgi apparatus.  However, the position of the fluorescent tag affected the subcellular  localization of both proteins. The work presented provides a comprehensive  analysis of the effects of disrupting ATCSLD5 in planta, and the possible role(s)  of this gene and other ATCSLDs in cell wall biosynthesis are discussed.', '2007 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03281.x', 'Willats']
