We previously showed that the rdn1 and sunn supernodulation mutants of Medicago truncatula respond differentially to overexpression of the rhizobial CLAVAT3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) signaling peptides MtCLE12p and MtCLE13p, allowing the order of action of the genes to be determined in the autoregulation of nodulation (AON) signal transduction pathway. We tested the same gene constructs that lead to the production of proteolytically processed peptides (indicated by a p after the name) in plants mutant for two other proteins that control nodule number (CRN and CRA2) and were able to determine that CRN is involved in the same signaling pathway as MtCLE12p and MtCLE13p, while regulation in CRA2 mutants responds normally to the peptides, suggesting CRA2 likely signals separately from SUNN, RDN1, and CRN. Based on the analysis of the double mutant of cra2-2 and sunn-4, we also confirm recent findings that CRA2 acts independently of SUNN in nodule number regulation.
