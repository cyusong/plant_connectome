Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is part of the ER protein quality-control system (ERQC), which is critical for the conformation fidelity of most secretory and membrane proteins in eukaryotic organisms. ERAD is thought to operate in plants with core machineries highly conserved to those in human and yeast; however, little is known about the plant ERAD system. Here we report the characterization of a close homolog of human OTUB1 in Arabidopsis thaliana, designated as AtOTU1. AtOTU1 selectively hydrolyzes several types of ubiquitin chains and these activities depend on its conserved protease domain and/or the unique N-terminus. The otu1 null mutant is sensitive to high salinity stress, and particularly agents that cause protein misfolding. It turns out that AtOTU1 is required for the processing of known plant ERAD substrates such as barley powdery mildew O (MLO) alleles by virtue of its association with the CDC48 complex through its N-terminal region. These observations collectively define AtOTU1 as an OTU domain-containing deubiquitinase involved in Arabidopsis ERAD.
