['17040918', 'Arabidopsis PDK1 activity is regulated by binding to the lipid phosphatidic acid  (PA) resulting in activation of the oxidative stress-response protein kinase  OXI1/AGC2-1. Thus there is an inferred link between lipid signaling and oxidative  stress signaling modules. Among a panel of hormones and stresses tested, we found  that, in addition to PA, the fungal elicitor xylanase activated PDK1, suggesting  that PDK1 has a role in plant pathogen defense mechanisms. The downstream OXI1  was activated by additional stress factors, including PA, H(2)O(2), and partially  by xylanase. We have isolated an interacting partner of OXI1, a Ser/Thr kinase  (PTI1-2), which is downstream of OXI1. Its sequence closely resembles the tomato  Pti kinase, which has been implicated in the hypersensitive response, a localized  programmed cell death that occurs at the site of pathogen infection. PTI1-2 is  activated by the same stresses/elicitors as OXI1 and additionally flagellin. We  have used RNA interference to knock out the expression of PDK1 and OXI1 and to  study the effects on PTI1-2 activity. We show that specific lipid signaling  pathways converge on PTI1-2 via the PDK1-OXI1 axis, whereas H(2)O(2) and  flagellin signals to OXI1-PTI1-2 via a PDK1-independent pathway. PTI1-2  represents a new downstream component that integrates diverse lipid and reactive  oxygen stress signals and functions closely with OXI1.', '2006 Dec 8', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M607341200', 'Bogre']
