['20844019', 'The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) regulates various developmental processes in  plants such as germination, greening, elongation growth, and flowering time.  DELLA proteins, which are degraded in response to GA, repress GA signaling by  inhibitory interactions with PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF) family  transcription factors. How GA signaling is controlled downstream from the DELLA  and PIF regulators is, at present, unclear. Here, we characterize GNC (GATA,  NITRATE-INDUCIBLE, CARBON-METABOLISM INVOLVED) and GNL/CGA1  (GNC-LIKE/CYTOKININ-RESPONSIVE GATA FACTOR1), two homologous GATA-type  transcription factors from Arabidopsis thaliana that we initially identified as  GA-regulated genes. Our genetic analyses of loss-of-function mutants and  overexpression lines establish that GNC and GNL are functionally redundant  regulators of germination, greening, elongation growth and flowering time. We  further show by chromatin immunoprecipitation that both genes are potentially  direct transcription targets of PIF transcription factors, and that their  expression is up-regulated in pif mutant backgrounds. In line with a key role of  GNC or GNL downstream from DELLA and PIF signaling, we find that their  overexpression leads to gene expression changes that largely resemble those  observed in a ga1 biosynthesis mutant or a pif quadruple mutant. These findings,  together with the fact that gnc and gnl loss-of-function mutations suppress ga1  phenotypes, support the hypothesis that GNC and GNL are important repressors of  GA signaling downstream from the DELLA and PIF regulators.', '2010 Sep 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.594910', 'Schwechheimer']
