In Sicily, small differences exist between wild and cultivated rosemary biotypes; VOCs and genetic profiles may be a useful tool to distinguish them. A germplasm collection of Rosmarinus officinalis L. was harvested from 15 locations in Sicily. Eleven wild and four cultivated populations were collected and, due to the surveyed area covered, they can be considered as a representative panel of Sicilian genetic background of the species. Ex situ plant collection was transferred to the field cultivation in homogeneous conditions for characterizing through a multidisciplinary approach. The study included morphological traits observations (growth habitus, flower color, number and size of leaves, length and number of internodes), VOC profiles using HS-SPME, genome size by flow cytometry analysis, and genetic characterization by means of DNA and nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) investigation. To detect any pattern within- and among-populations variability, all morphological and chemical data were submitted to ANOVA, while clustering and structure population analysis were carried out using genetic profiles. The present work allowed us to distinguish rather well between wild and cultivated genotypes and to underline the biodiversity richness among rosemary Sicilian germplasm, never highlighted, useful for future breeding programs addressed to exploit this important resource.
