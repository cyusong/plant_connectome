In Arabidopsis, the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED (CLE) peptides play important roles in regulating proliferation and differentiation of plant-specific stem cells. Although receptors of CLEs are reported to be leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases, the mechanisms underlying CLE-induced receptor activation remain largely unknown. Here we show that SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASEs (SERKs) serve as co-receptors in CLE41/TDIF-PXY signaling to regulate plant vascular development. TDIF induces interaction of its receptor PXY with SERKs in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the serk1-1 serk2-1 bak1-5 mutant plants are less sensitive to TDIF, phenocopying the pxy mutant with a compromised promotion of procambial cell proliferation. Crystal structure of the PXY-TDIF-SERK2 complex reveals that the last amino acid of TDIF conserved among CLEs and other evolutionary-related peptides is important for the interaction between SERK2 and PXY. Taken together, our current study identifies SERKs as signaling components of the TDIF-PXY pathway and suggests a conserved activation mechanism of CLE receptors.
