By using mechanical and optical sectioning of DII/mDII and R2D2 auxin sensors, we reconfirmed the presence of asymmetric auxin signaling in leaf primordia. We also showed that the imaging data reported by Bhatia et al. (2019) may suffer from artefacts, and that their analysis was artificially biased due to an arbitrary domain demarcation.
