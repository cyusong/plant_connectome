High salinity seriously affects crop growth and yield. Abscisic acid-, stress-, and ripening-induced (ASR) proteins play an important role in plant responses to multiple abiotic stresses. In this study, we identified a new salt-induced <i>ASR</i> gene in rice (<i>OsASR6</i>) and functionally characterized its role in mediating salt tolerance. Transcript levels of <i>OsASR6</i> were upregulated under salinity stress, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of the OsASR6 protein were confirmed. Meanwhile, a transactivation activity assay in yeast demonstrated no self-activation ability. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing <i>OsASR6</i> showed enhanced salt and oxidative stress tolerance as a result of reductions in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, malondialdehyde (MDA), Na/K and relative electrolyte leakage. In contrast, <i>OsASR6</i> RNAi transgenic lines showed opposite results. A higher ABA content was also measured in the <i>OsASR6</i> overexpressing lines compared with the control. Moreover, OsNCED1, a key enzyme of ABA biosynthesis, was found to interact with OsASR6. Collectively, these results suggest that OsASR6 serves primarily as a functional protein, enhancing tolerance to salt stress, representing a candidate gene for genetic manipulation of new salinity-resistant lines in rice.
