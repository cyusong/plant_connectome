Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), can elicit type I allergy becoming the most common cause of fatal food-induced anaphylactic reactions. Strict avoidance is the only effective means of dealing with this allergy. Ara h 2, a peanut seed storage protein, has been identified as the most potent peanut allergen and is recognized by approximately 90% of peanut hypersensitive individuals in the US. Because peanut has limited genetic variation, wild relatives are a good source of genetic diversity. After screening 30 Arachis duranensis accessions by EcoTILLing, we characterized five different missense mutations in ara d 2.01. None of these polymorphisms induced major conformational modifications. Nevertheless, a polymorphism in the immunodominant epitope #7 (S73T) showed a 56-99% reduction in IgE-binding activity and did not affect T cell epitopes, which must be retained for effective immunotherapy. The identification of natural hypoallergenic isoforms positively contributes to future immunological and therapeutic studies and peanut cultivar development.
