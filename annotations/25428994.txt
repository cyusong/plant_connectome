Aliphatic glucosinolates (GLSs) are derived from chain-elongated methionine produced by an iterative three-step process, known to be evolutionarily recruited from leucine biosynthesis. The divergence of homologous genes between two pathways is mainly linked to the alterations in biochemical features. In this study, it was discovered that a distinct pattern of histone modifications is associated with and/or contributes to the divergence of the two pathways. In general, genes involved in leucine biosynthesis were robustly associated with H3k4me2 and H3K4me3. In contrast, despite the considerable abundances of H3K4me2 observed in some of genes involved in methionine chain elongation, H3K4me3 was completely missing. This H3K4m3-depleted pattern had no effect on gene transcription, whereas it seemingly co-evolved with the entire pathway of aliphatic GLS biosynthesis. The results reveal a novel association of the epigenetic marks with plant secondary metabolism, and may help to understand the recruitment of the methionine chain-elongation pathway from leucine biosynthesis.
