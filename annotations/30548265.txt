The impact of drought on plant growth and yield has been widely studied and is considered a major limitation to crops reaching yield potential. Less known is the impact of water deficit on the nutritional quality of the resulting yield. This study characterised the impact of water deficit on carbon assimilation, modelled water use efficiency from carbon isotope discrimination and analysed the concentration of mineral nutrients, amino acids and sugars in leaf, phloem and pod pools collected from Phaseolus vulgaris L. (common bean) grown in a controlled environment. Water deficit led to an isohydric response, impacting on carbon isotope abundance in all tissues though not translating to any significant treatment differences in water use efficiency or nutrient content in tissues over the course of plant development. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that nutrient content of P. vulgaris yield was not impacted by the availability of water. The absence of significant changes in the nutrient content of individual seeds highlights the plasticity of developing reproductive tissue to changes in whole plant water availability.
