Plant nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors mediate effector-triggered immunity. Two major classes of NB-LRR proteins are involved in this process, namely, toll-interleukin receptor (TIR)-NB-LRR and coiled coil (CC)-NB-LRR proteins. Recent reports show that some of the TIR-NB-LRRs and CC-NB-LRRs localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Equilibrium between these pools is required for full resistance, suggesting tight regulation of nucleocytoplasmic receptor shuttling. We recently showed that SGT1, a protein that controls NB-LRR receptor stability and activity, facilitates nuclear import of N protein, which is a TIR-NB-LRR receptor. In this addendum, we show that the subcellular localization of Rx, a CC-NB-LRR protein, reflects the positions of SGT1 ectopic variants in the cell. This suggests that SGT1 might have a general role in maintaining the nucleocytoplasmic balance of NB-LRR receptors. We discuss these results in light of differences in the N and Rx systems of effector-triggered immunity.
