This study investigates whether it is possible to produce an amylose-free potato starch by displacing the amylose enzyme, granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI), from the starch granule by engineered, high-affinity, multiple-repeat family 20 starch-binding domains (SBD2, SBD3, SBD4, and SBD5). The constructs were introduced in the amylose-containing potato cultivar (cv. Kardal), and the starches of the resulting transformants were compared with those of SBD2-expressing amylose-free (amf) potato clones. It is shown that a correctly sized protein accumulated in the starch granules of the various transformants. The amount of SBD accumulated in starch increased progressively from SBD to SBD3; however, it seemed as if less SBD4 and SBD5 was accumulated. A reduction in amylose content was not achieved in any of the transformants. However, it is shown that SBDn expression can affect physical processes underlying granule assembly, in both genetic potato backgrounds, without altering the primary structure of the constituent starch polymers and the granule melting temperature. Granule size distribution of the starches obtained from transgenic Kardal plants were similar to those from untransformed controls, irrespective of the amount of SBDn accumulated. In the amf background, granule size is severely affected. In both the Kardal and amf background, apparently normal oval-shaped starch granules were composed of multiple smaller ones, as evidenced from the many "Maltese crosses" within these granules. The results are discussed in terms of different binding modes of SBD.
