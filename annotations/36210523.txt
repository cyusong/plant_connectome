Arginine decarboxylase (ADC)-mediated putrescine (Put) biosynthesis plays an important role in plant abiotic stress response. SNF1-related protein kinases 2s (SnRK2s) and abscisic acid (ABA)-response element (ABRE)-binding factors (ABFs), are core components of the ABA signaling pathway involved in drought stress response. We previously reported that ADC of Poncirus trifoliata (PtrADC) functions in drought tolerance. However, whether and how SnRK2 and ABF regulate PtrADC to modulate putrescine accumulation under drought stress remains largely unclear. Herein, we employed a set of physiological, biochemical, and molecular approaches to reveal that a protein complex composed of PtrSnRK2.4 and PtrABF2 modulates putrescine biosynthesis and drought tolerance by directly regulating PtrADC. PtrABF2 was upregulated by dehydration in an ABA-dependent manner. PtrABF2 activated PtrADC expression by directly and specifically binding to the ABRE core sequence within its promoter and positively regulated drought tolerance via modulating putrescine accumulation. PtrSnRK2.4 interacts with and phosphorylates PtrABF2 at Ser93. PtrSnRK2.4-mediated PtrABF2 phosphorylation is essential for the transcriptional regulation of PtrADC. Besides, PtrSnRK2.4 was shown to play a positive role in drought tolerance by facilitating putrescine synthesis. Taken together, this study sheds new light on the regulatory module SnRK2.4-ABF2-ADC responsible for fine-tuning putrescine accumulation under drought stress, which advances our understanding on transcriptional regulation of putrescine synthesis.
