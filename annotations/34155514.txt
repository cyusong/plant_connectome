Trichomes are hair-like structures that are essential for abiotic and biotic stress responses. Tomato Hair (H), encoding a C2H2 zinc finger protein, was found to regulate the multicellular trichomes on stems. Here, we characterized Solyc10g078990 (hereafter Hair2, H2), its closest homolog, to examine whether it was involved in trichome development. The H2 gene was highly expressed in the leaves, and its protein contained a single C2H2 domain and was localized to the nucleus. The number and length of type I trichomes on the leaves and stems of knock-out h2 plants were reduced when compared to the wild-type, while overexpression increased their number and length. An auto-activation test with various truncated forms of H2 using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) suggested that H2 acts as a transcriptional regulator or co-activator and that its N-terminal region is important for auto-activation. Y2H and pull-down analyses showed that H2 interacts with Woolly (Wo), which regulates the development of type I trichomes in tomato. Luciferase complementation imaging assays confirmed that they had direct interactions, implying that H2 and Wo function together to regulate the development of trichomes. These results suggest that H2 has a role in the initiation and elongation of type I trichomes in tomato.
