Increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations accompanied by abiotic stresses challenge food production worldwide. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>e</i>[CO<sub>2</sub>]) affects plant water relations <i>via</i> multiple mechanisms involving abscisic acid (ABA). Here, two tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) genotypes, Ailsa Craig (AC) and its ABA-deficient mutant (<i>flacca</i>), were used to investigate the responses of plant hydraulic conductance to <i>e</i>[CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought stress. Results showed that <i>e</i>[CO<sub>2</sub>] decreased transpiration rate (<i>E</i>) increased plant water use efficiency only in AC, whereas it increased daily plant water consumption and osmotic adjustment in both genotypes. Compared to growth at ambient [CO<sub>2</sub>], AC leaf and root hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i> <sub>leaf</sub> and <i>K</i> <sub>root</sub>) decreased at <i>e</i>[CO<sub>2</sub>], which coincided with the transcriptional regulations of genes of plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) and OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1), and these effects were attenuated in <i>flacca</i> during soil drying. Severe drought stress could override the effects of <i>e</i>[CO<sub>2</sub>] on plant water relation characteristics. In both genotypes, drought stress resulted in decreased <i>E</i>, <i>K</i> <sub>leaf</sub>, and <i>K</i> <sub>root</sub> accompanied by transcriptional responses of PIPs and OST1. However, under conditions combining <i>e</i>[CO<sub>2</sub>] and drought, some PIPs were not responsive to drought in AC, indicating that <i>e</i>[CO<sub>2</sub>] might disturb ABA-mediated drought responses. These results provide some new insights into mechanisms of plant hydraulic response to drought stress in a future CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched environment.
