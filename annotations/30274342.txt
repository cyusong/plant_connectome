Stilbene synthase genes make a contribution to improving the tolerances of biotic and abiotic stress in plants. However, the mechanisms mediated by these <i>STS</i> genes remain unclear. To provide insight into the role of <i>STS</i> genes defense against biotic and abiotic stress, we overexpressed <i>VqSTS36</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and tomato (Micro-Tom) via <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation. <i>VqSTS36</i>-transformed Arabidopsis lines displayed an increased resistance to powdery mildew, but both <i>VqSTS36</i>-transformed Arabidopsis and tomato lines showed the increased susceptibility to <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Besides, transgenic Arabidopsis lines were found to confer tolerance to salt and drought stress in seed and seedlings. When transgenic plants were treated with a different stress, qPCR assays of defense-related genes in transgenic Arabidopsis and tomato suggested that <i>VqSTS36</i> played a specific role in different phytohormone-related pathways, including salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid signaling pathways. All of these results provided a better understanding of the mechanism behind the role of <i>VqSTS36</i> in biotic and abiotic stress.
