Photosynthesis is limited by the conductance of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) from intercellular spaces to the sites of carboxylation. Although the concept of internal conductance (g(i)) has been known for over 50 years, shortcomings in the theoretical description of this process may have resulted in a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. To tackle this issue, we developed a three-dimensional reaction-diffusion model of photosynthesis in a typical C(3) mesophyll cell that includes all major components of the CO(2) diffusion pathway and associated reactions. Using this novel systems model, we systematically and quantitatively examined the mechanisms underlying g(i). Our results identify the resistances of the cell wall and chloroplast envelope as the most significant limitations to photosynthesis. In addition, the concentration of carbonic anhydrase in the stroma may also be limiting for the photosynthetic rate. Our analysis demonstrated that higher levels of photorespiration increase the apparent resistance to CO(2) diffusion, an effect that has thus far been ignored when determining g(i). Finally, we show that outward bicarbonate leakage through the chloroplast envelope could contribute to the observed decrease in g(i) under elevated CO(2). Our analysis suggests that physiological and anatomical features associated with g(i) have been evolutionarily fine-tuned to benefit CO(2) diffusion and photosynthesis. The model presented here provides a novel theoretical framework to further analyze the mechanisms underlying diffusion processes in the mesophyll.
