Oxylipins have been extensively studied in plant defense mechanisms or as signal molecules. Depending on the stress origin (e.g. wounding, insect, pathogen), and also on the plant species or organ, a specific oxylipin signature can be generated. Salt stress is frequently associated with secondary stress such as oxidative damage. Little is known about the damage caused to lipids under salt stress conditions, especially with respect to oxylipins. In order to determine if an organ-specific oxylipin signature could be observed during salt stress, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Money Maker) plants were submitted to salt stress (100 mM of NaCl) for a 30-d period. A complete oxylipin profiling and LOX related-gene expression measurement were achieved in leaves and roots. As expected, salt stress provoked premature senescence in leaves, as revealed by a decrease in photosystem II efficiency (F(v)/F(m) ratio) and sodium accumulation in leaves. In roots, a significant decrease in several oxylipins (9- and 13-hydro(pero)xy linole(n)ic acids, keto and divinyl ether derivatives) was initiated at day 5 and intensified at day 21 after salt treatment, whereas jasmonic acid content increased. In leaves, the main changes in oxylipins were observed later (at day 30), with an increase in some 9- and 13-hydro(pero)xy linole(n)ic acids and a decrease in some keto-derivatives and in jasmonic acid. Oxylipin enantiomeric characterization revealed that almost all compounds were formed enzymatically, and therefore a massive auto-oxidation of lipids that can be encountered in abscission processes can be excluded here.
