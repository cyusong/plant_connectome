['14976233', 'Two biosynthetic pathways for ascorbate (l-ascorbic acid [AsA]; vitamin C) in  plants are presently known, the mannose/l-galactose pathway and an l-GalUA  pathway. Here, we present molecular and biochemical evidence for a possible  biosynthetic route using myo-inositol (MI) as the initial substrate. A MI  oxygenase (MIOX) gene was identified in chromosome 4 (miox4) of Arabidopsis  ecotype Columbia, and its enzymatic activity was confirmed in bacterially  expressed recombinant protein. Miox4 was primarily expressed in flowers and  leaves of wild-type Arabidopsis plants, tissues with a high concentration of AsA.  Ascorbate levels increased 2- to 3-fold in homozygous Arabidopsis lines  overexpressing the miox4 open reading frame, thus suggesting the role of MI in  AsA biosynthesis and the potential for using this gene for the agronomic and  nutritional enhancement of crops.', '2004 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.033936', 'Nessler']
