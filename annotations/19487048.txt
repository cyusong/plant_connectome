Tyrosine decarboxylase (TyrDC) is an important enzyme in the secondary metabolism of several plant species, and was hypothesized to play a key role in the biosynthesis of salidroside, a pharmacologically valuable compound of roseroot. A 1520bp cDNA was cloned and sequenced, and turned out to contain an ORF of 963bp, which encodes a protein of 320 amino acids. The expression of the gene was studied by real-time PCR from leaves and roots of both high and low salidroside producer genotype of roseroot. The gene expression analysis showed the gene to be expressed in leaves as well as in roots; however, the expression was significantly higher in roots, which coincides with the fact that salidroside accumulates preferentially in the underground parts of the plant. The expression was also higher in the line accumulating high levels of salidroside, compared to the line with lower salidroside content. The difference in the expression intensity suggests a decisive role for this enzyme in the salidroside biosynthesis.
