Nitrogen (N) fertilization is a promising approach to improve salt tolerance. However, it is poorly known how plant sex and inorganic N alter salt stress-induced Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, distribution and tolerance. This study employed Populus cathayana Rehder females and males to examine sex-related mechanisms of salt tolerance under nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ) and ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> ) nutrition. Males had a higher root Na<sup>+</sup> efflux, lower root-to-shoot translocation of Na<sup>+</sup> , and higher K<sup>+</sup> /Na<sup>+</sup> , which enhanced salt tolerance under both N forms compared to females. On the other hand, decreased root Na<sup>+</sup> efflux and K<sup>+</sup> retention, and an increased ratio of Na<sup>+</sup> in leaves relative to shoots in females caused greater salt sensitivity. Females receiving NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> rather than NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> had greater net root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, K<sup>+</sup> efflux, and translocation to the shoots, especially in leaves. In contrast, males receiving NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> rather than NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> had increased Na<sup>+</sup> translocation to the shoots, especially in the bark, which may narrow the difference in leaf damage by salt stress between N forms despite a higher shoot Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation and lower root Na<sup>+</sup> efflux. Genes related to cell wall synthesis, K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transporters, and denaturized protein scavenging in the barks showed differential expression between females and males in response to salt stress under both N forms. These results suggested that the regulation of N forms in salt stress tolerance was sex-dependent, which was related to the maintenance of the K<sup>+</sup> /Na<sup>+</sup> ratio in tissues, the ability of Na<sup>+</sup> translocation to the shoots, and the transcriptional regulation of bark cell wall and proteolysis profiles.
