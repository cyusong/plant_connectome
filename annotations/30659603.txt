Conclusion 1227 Acknowledgements 1228 References 1228 SUMMARY: Our ability to understand the effect of nutrient limitation on ecosystem productivity is key to the prediction of future terrestrial carbon storage. Significant progress has been made to include phosphorus (P) cycle processes in land surface models (LSMs), but these efforts are focused on the soil component of the P cycle. Incorporating the soil component is important to estimate plant-available P, but does not necessarily address the vegetation response to P limitation or plant-soil interactions. A more detailed representation of plant P processes is needed to link nutrient availability and ecosystem productivity. We review physiological and biochemical evidence for vegetation responses to P availability, and recommend ways to move towards a more physiological representation of vegetation P processes in LSMs.
