Nostoc muscorum and Spirulina platensis were grown under phosphate deficiency in order to investigate the role of internal phosphate pool and activity of alkaline phosphatase on poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) accumulation. PHB accumulation in N. muscorum increased to 22.7% of dry weight (dw) after 4 day of phosphate deficiency, while the internal phosphate pool reduced to the level of 0.02 microM mg dw(-1) at a maximum APase activity of 2.57nM PNP mg dw(-1) h(-1). In contrary, S. platensis depicted maxima of 1.39nM PNP mg dw(-1) h(-1) on day 30 of incubation, which was about 2 fold lower than the observed value of N. muscorum. PHB content in S. platensis remained low even after prolonged phosphate starvation, and a rise only up to 3.5% of dw was recorded on day 60 of phosphate deficiency. Supplementation of NADPH exogenously to S. platensis cultures grown under phosphate deficiency favoured PHB accumulation in 10, 20 and 30 days old cultures, but not in the cultures grown under phosphate deficiency for 60 days. The possible role of phosphate limitation on PHB accumulation is discussed.
