['15369784', 'An Arabidopsis cDNA clone that encodes Athb-12, a homeobox-leucine zipper domain  protein (HD-Zip), was isolated by functional complementation of the  NaCl-sensitive phenotype of a calcineurin (CaN)-deficient yeast mutant (cnbDelta,  regulatory subunit null). CaN, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase,  regulates Na+ ion homeostasis in yeast. Expression of Athb-12 increased NaCl  tolerance but not osmotic stress tolerance of these cnbDelta cells. Furthermore,  expression of two other HD-Zip from Arabidopsis, Athb-1 and -7, did not suppress  NaCl sensitivity of cnbDelta cells. These results suggest that Athb-12  specifically functions in Na+ ion homeostasis in yeast. Consistent with these  observations, expression of Athb-12 in yeast turned on transcription of the NaCl  stress-inducible PMR2A, which encodes a Na+/Li+ translocating P-type ATPase, and  decreased Na+ levels in yeast cells. To investigate the biological function of  Athb-12 in Arabidopsis, we performed Northern blot analysis. Expression of  Athb-12 was dramatically induced by NaCl and ABA treatments, but not by KCl. In  vivo targeting experiments using a green fluorescent protein reporter indicated  that Athb-12 was localized to the nucleus. These results suggest that Athb-12 is  a putative transcription factor that may be involved in NaCl stress responses in  plants.', '2004 Oct 15', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.08.127', 'Yun']
