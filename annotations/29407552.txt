The circadian clock is crucial for the synchronization of an organism's physiology and metabolism with the geophysical time. In plants, previous work on the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) has identified various differing aspects of clock function compared to the widely studied Arabidopsis thaliana clock. However, transformation of legumes for the study of the circadian clock regulatory mechanisms is extremely laborious. In the present work, we describe an easy-to-follow and rapid method of preparing bean leaf protoplasts with high transformation potential and a functional circadian clock. In this system, we show that application of trichostatin A differentially changes the expression levels of several clock genes. More importantly, we investigate the effect of the clock protein PvTOC1 (Phaseolus vulgaris TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1) on the activity of bean circadian promoters. We present new evidence on the function of PvTOC1 as a repressor of the promoter activity of its own gene, mediated by its conserved CCT (CONSTANS, CO-LIKE and TOC1) domain. Using our protoplast system we were able to uncover functions of the bean circadian clock and to identify an additional target of the PvTOC1clock transcription factor, not previously reported.
