Plant water transport and its molecular components including aquaporins are responsive, across diverse time scales, to an extremely wide array of environmental and hormonal signals. These include water deficit and abscisic acid (ABA) but also more recently identified stimuli such as peptide hormones or bacterial elicitors. The present review makes an inventory of corresponding signalling pathways. It identifies some main principles, such as the central signalling role of ROS, with a dual function of aquaporins in water and hydrogen peroxide transport, the importance of aquaporin phosphorylation that is targeted by multiple classes of protein kinases, and the emerging role of lipid signalling. More studies including systems biology approaches are now needed to comprehend how plant water transport can be adjusted in response to combined stresses.
