As a leading oilseed crop that supplies plant oil and protein for daily human life, increasing yield and improving nutritional quality (high oil or protein) are the top two fundamental goals of soybean breeding. Seed size is one of the most critical factors determining soybean yield. Seed size, oil and protein contents are complex quantitative traits governed by genetic and environmental factors during seed development. The composition and quantity of seed storage reserves directly affect seed size. In general, oil and protein make up almost 60% of the total storage of soybean seed. Therefore, soybean's seed size, oil, or protein content are highly correlated agronomical traits. Increasing seed size helps increase soybean yield and probably improves seed quality. Similarly, rising oil and protein contents improves the soybean's nutritional quality and will likely increase soybean yield. Due to the importance of these three seed traits in soybean breeding, extensive studies have been conducted on their underlying quantitative trait locus (QTLs) or genes and the dissection of their molecular regulatory pathways. This review summarized the progress in functional genome controlling soybean seed size, oil and protein contents in recent decades, and presented the challenges and prospects for developing high-yield soybean cultivars with high oil or protein content. In the end, we hope this review will be helpful to the improvement of soybean yield and quality in the future breeding process.
