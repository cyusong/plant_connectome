In this paper, we describe how Bupleurum scorzonerifolium/Triticum aestivum asymmetric somatic hybrids can be exploited to study the wheat genome. Protoplasts of B. scorzonerifolium Willd were irradiated with ultraviolet light (UV) and fused with protoplasts of common wheat (T. aestivum L.). All cell clones were similar in appearance to those of B. scorzonerifolium, while the regenerated plantlets were either intermediate or B. scorzonerifolium-like. Genotypic screening using isozymes showed that 39.3% of cell clones formed were hybrid. Some of the hybrid cell clones grew vigorously, and differentiated green leaves, shoots or plantlets. DNA marker analysis of the hybrids demonstrated that wheat DNA was integrated into the nuclear genomes of B. scorzonerifolium and in situ karyotyping cells revealed that a few wheat chromosome fragments had been introgressed into B. scorzonerifolium. The average wheat SSR retention frequency of the RH panel was 20.50%, but was only 6.67% in fusions with a non-irradiated donor. B. scorzonerifolium chromosomes and wheat SSR fragments in most asymmetric hybrid cell lines remained stable over a period of 2.5-3.5 years. We suggest the UV-induced asymmetric somatic hybrids between B. scorzonerifolium Willd and T. aestivum L. have the potential for use in the construction of an RH map of the wheat genome.
