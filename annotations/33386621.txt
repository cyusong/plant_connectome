Legumes control their nodule numbers through the autoregulation of nodulation (AON). Rhizobia infection stimulates the production of root-derived CLE peptide hormones that are translocated to the shoot where they regulate a new signal. We used soybean to demonstrate that this shoot-derived signal is miR2111, which is transported via phloem to the root where it targets transcripts of Too Much Love (TML), a negative regulator of nodulation. Shoot perception of rhizobia-induced CLE peptides suppresses miR2111 expression, resulting in TML accumulation in roots and subsequent inhibition of nodule organogenesis. Feeding synthetic mature miR2111 via the petiole increased nodule numbers per plant. Likewise, elevating miR2111 availability by over-expression promoted nodulation, while target mimicry of TML induced the opposite effect on nodule development in wild-type plants and alleviated the supernodulating and stunted root growth phenotypes of AON-defective mutants. Additionally, in non-nodulating wild-type plants, ectopic expression of miR2111 significantly enhanced lateral root emergence with a decrease in lateral root length and average root diameter. In contrast, hairy roots constitutively expressing the target mimic construct exhibited reduced lateral root density. Overall, these findings demonstrate that miR2111 is both the critical shoot-to-root factor that positively regulates root nodule development and also acts to shape root system architecture.
