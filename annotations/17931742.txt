Two previously uncharacterized cDNAs encoding for polyketide synthases (PKSs), designated as HpPKS1 and HpPKS2, were isolated from Hypericum perforatum. The full-length HpPKS1 was 1573bp containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1161bp encoding for a 386 amino acid protein. The full-length cDNA of HpPKS2 was 1559bp with an ORF of 1182bp encoding for a 393 amino acid protein. The highly conserved catalytic amino acid residues common to plant-specific PKSs were preserved in both genes. HpPKS1 and HpPKS2 exhibited distinct tissue-specific expression patterns in H. perforatum. The HpPKS1 expression was highest in flower buds and lowest in root tissues. The expression of HpPKS2 was found to be high in flower buds and leaf margins and low in leaf interior parts, stems and roots. The expression of the HpPKS1 was found to correlate with the concentrations of hyperforin and adhyperforin while the expression of HpPKS2 showed correlation with the concentrations of hypericins and pseudohypericins in H. perforatum tissues.
