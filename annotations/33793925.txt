In a crowded environment, establishing interactions between different molecular partners can take a long time. Biological membranes have solved this issue, as they simultaneously are fluid and possess compartmentalized domains. This nanoscale organization of the membrane is often based on weak, local, and multivalent interactions between lipids and proteins. However, from local interactions at the nanoscale, different functional properties emerge at the higher scale, and these are critical to regulate and integrate cellular signaling. Rho of Plant (ROP) proteins are small guanosine triphosphate hydrolase enzymes (GTPases) involved in hormonal, biotic, and abiotic signaling, as well as fundamental cell biological properties such as polarity, vesicular trafficking, and cytoskeleton dynamics. Association with the membrane is essential for ROP function, as well as their precise targeting within micrometer-sized polar domains (i.e. microdomains) and nanometer-sized clusters (i.e. nanodomains). Here, we review our current knowledge about the formation and the maintenance of the ROP domains in membranes. Furthermore, we propose a model for ROP membrane targeting and discuss how the nanoscale organization of ROPs in membranes could determine signaling parameters like signal specificity, amplification, and integration.
