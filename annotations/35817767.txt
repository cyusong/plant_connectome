['35817767', 'Auxin critically regulates plant growth and development. Auxin-driven  transcriptional responses are mediated through the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF)  family of transcription factors. ARF protein condensation attenuates ARF  activity, resulting in dramatic shifts in the auxin transcriptional landscape.  Here, we perform a forward genetics screen for ARF hypercondensation, identifying  an F-box protein, which we named AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR F-BOX1 (AFF1). Functional  characterization of SCF(AFF1) revealed that this E3 ubiquitin ligase directly  interacts with ARF19 and ARF7 to regulate their accumulation, condensation, and  nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning. Mutants defective in AFF1 display attenuated  auxin responsiveness, and developmental defects, suggesting that SCF(AFF1)  -mediated regulation of ARF protein drives aspects of auxin response and plant  development.', '2022 Jul 11', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-022-31628-2', 'ORCID:']
