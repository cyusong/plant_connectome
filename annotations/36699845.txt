Rice (<i>Oryza sativa L.</i>) production is being challenged by global warming. Identifying new loci and favorable alleles associated with heat tolerance is crucial to developing rice heat-tolerant varieties. We evaluated the heat tolerance at the seedling stage using 620 diverse rice accessions. A total of six loci associated with heat tolerance were identified by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with ~2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Among the six detected loci, <i>qHT7</i> harbored the strongest association signal and the most associated SNPs. By comparing the transcriptomes of two representative accessions with contrasting heat tolerance, <i>LOC_Os07g48710</i> (<i>OsVQ30</i>) was selected as a promising candidate gene in <i>qHT7</i> due to the significant difference in its expression level between the two accessions. Haplotype 4 (Hap4) of <i>LOC_Os07g48710</i> was determined as the favorable haplotype for heat tolerance via the gene-based haplotype analysis. The heat-tolerant haplotype <i>LOC_Os07g48710</i>Hap4 is highly enriched in the tropical <i>Geng/Japonica</i> accessions, and its frequency has decreased significantly during the improvement process of rice varieties. Based on the GWAS and transcriptomics integrated results, a hypothetical model modulated by <i>qHT7</i> in response to heat stress was proposed. Our results provide valuable candidate genes for improving rice heat tolerance through molecular breeding.
