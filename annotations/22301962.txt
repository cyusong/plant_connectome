The Arabidopsis thaliana trichome development is a model system for understanding various aspects of plant cell development and differentiation. The C2H2 zinc finger proteins GIS, GIS2, and ZFP8 play important roles in controlling trichome initiation. In our recent study, we reported that a new C2H2 zinc finger protein, ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 5 (ZFP5), controls trichome cell development through GA signaling. ZFP5 acts upstream of GIS gene family and key trichome initiation regulators, and ZFP8 is the direct target gene of ZFP5. Here we show that ZFP5 encodes a protein functionally equivalent to GIS and GIS2 in controlling trichome initiation. Furthermore, similar to GIS2, ZFP5 is not involved in trichome branching.
