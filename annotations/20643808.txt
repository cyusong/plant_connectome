Heat shock (HS) at 40 degrees C was given to the root system of Nicotiana tabacum wild type (WT) and to HSIPT transgenic plants transformed with the bacterial cytokinin biosynthesis gene isopentenyltransferase (ipt) cloned behind the heat shock 70 promoter from Drosophila melanogaster. HS increased cytokinin concentrations in roots and leaves of transgenic plants. The effect was smaller in WT plants and restricted to upper leaves. HS also increased the activity of the cytokinin-degrading enzyme cytokinin oxidase in leaves of transgenic plants. This suggests that increases in cytokinin concentration induced by HS were lessened but not eliminated by increases in cytokinin oxidase. Elevated levels of zeatin riboside (the main transportable form of cytokinin) were also found in the HS-treated roots. It is proposed that increases in leaves were the outcome of increased transport of this hormone from roots in the transpiration stream. In conjunction with increased leaf cytokinin concentration, HS treatment to the roots increased stomatal conductivity and transpiration in both transgenic and WT plants. Subsequently, increased transpiration depressed leaf relative water content. This, in turn, raised leaf abscisic acid (ABA) concentrations, resulting in stomatal closure. It is concluded that the preceding increases in leaf cytokinin concentration, stomatal opening, and faster transpiration resulting from the localized induction of ip gene expression in roots strengthens the concept of cytokinin involvement in root to shoot signalling.
