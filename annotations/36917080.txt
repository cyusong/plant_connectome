As a fungicide, oxathiapiprolin has excellent effects on diseases caused by oomycetes. Fungicides generally protect crops by inhibiting pathogens, but little research has addressed the effects of fungicides on crops. This study combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to systematically analyze the physiological regulatory mechanisms of oxathiapiprolin on tobacco under Phytophthora nicotianae infection. The results showed that under Phytophthora nicotianae infection, tobacco's photosynthetic rate and antioxidant enzyme activity increased after the application of oxathiapiprolin. Omics results showed that the genes related to carbon metabolism, disease-resistant proteins, and amino acid synthesis were highly expressed, and the amino acid content increased in tobacco leaves. This study is the first comprehensive investigation of the physiological regulatory effects of oxathiapiprolin on tobacco in response to Phytophthora nicotianae infection. These findings provide a basis for the balance between regulating tobacco growth and development and enhancing disease resistance under the stimulation of oxathiapiprolin and provide new research and development opportunities for identifying new disease-resistance genes and the development of high-yielding disease-resistant crop varieties.
