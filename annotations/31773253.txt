['31773253', 'The chloroplast-localized protein CSAP is an ABA-responsive factor and positively  regulates dark-induced senescence. This phenomenon is controlled by SAUL1 in  Arabidopsis. We report here that CSAP (Chloroplast-localized  Senescence-Associated Protein, AT5G39520) functions as a positive regulator of  senescence and is controlled by SAUL1 (Senescence Associated E3 Ubiquitin Ligase  1) in Arabidopsis. CSAP transcript level was gradually increased when senescence  was progressed. Under dark conditions, the csap mutant showed delayed leaf  senescence and reduced chlorophyll breakdown, but overexpression of CSAP  accelerated leaf senescence and expressions of chlorophyll catabolic genes were  up-regulated compared to the wild-type (WT). NCED3 and AAO3, which are involved  in ABA biosynthesis, also showed higher expression in the overexpression lines  than the WT. It is known that the CSAP transcript is increased in the saul1  mutant that shows precocious senescence. In our experiments, we confirmed that  CSAP interacts with SAUL1 by the yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays. In  addition, we found that SAUL1 decreases the stability of CSAP in the presence of  ABA. Taken together, we suggest that CSAP accelerates leaf senescence in the dark  and this process is controlled by SAUL1.', '2020 Mar', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-019-02493-z', 'ORCID:']
