Fatty acids in crop seeds are a major source for both vegetable oils and industrial applications. Genetic improvement of fatty acid composition and oil content is critical to meet the current and future demands of plant-based renewable seed oils. Addressing this challenge can be approached by network modeling to capture key contributors of seed metabolism and to identify underpinning genetic targets for engineering the traits associated with seed oil composition and content. Here, we present a dynamic model, using an Ordinary Differential Equations model and integrated time-course gene expression data, to describe metabolic networks during <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> seed development. Through <i>in silico</i> perturbation of genes, targets were predicted in seed oil traits. Validation and supporting evidence were obtained for several of these predictions using published reports in the scientific literature. Furthermore, we investigated two predicted targets using omics datasets for both gene expression and metabolites from the seed embryo, and demonstrated the applicability of this network-based model. This work highlights that integration of dynamic gene expression atlases generates informative models which can be explored to dissect metabolic pathways and lead to the identification of causal genes associated with seed oil traits.
