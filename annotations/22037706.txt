['22037706', 'We present an Arabidopsis thaliana full-length transcription factor resource of  92% of root stele-expressed transcription factors and 74.5% of root-expressed  transcription factors. We demonstrate its use with enhanced yeast one-hybrid  (eY1H) screening for rapid, systematic mapping of plant transcription  factor-promoter interactions. We identified 158 interactions with 13  stele-expressed promoters, many of which occur physically or are regulatory in  planta.', '2011 Oct 30', 'Nat Methods', '10.1038/nmeth.1750', 'Brady']
