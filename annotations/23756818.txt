Dormancy is one of the most important adaptive mechanisms developed by perennial plants. To reveal the comprehensive mechanism of seasonal bud dormancy at four critical stages in Japanese apricot (Prunus persica), we applied Illumina sequencing to study differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the transcriptional level. As a result, 19,759, 16,375, 19,749 and 20,800 tag-mapped genes were sequenced from libraries of paradormancy (R1), endodormancy (R2), ecodormancy (R3) and dormancy release (R4) stages based on the P. persica genome. Moreover, 6,199, 5,539, and 5,317 genes were differentially expressed in R1 versus R2, R2 versus R3, and R3 versus R4, respectively. Gene Ontology analysis of dormancy-related genes showed that these were mainly related to the cytoplasm, cytoplasmic part metabolism, intracellular metabolism and membrane-bound organelle metabolism. Pathway-enrichment annotation revealed that highly ranked genes were involved in ribosome pathways and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results demonstrated that hormone response genes such as auxin, abscisic acid, ethylene and jasmonic acid, as well as zinc finger family protein genes are possibly involved in seasonal bud dormancy in Japanese apricot. The expression patterns of DEGs were verified using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. These results contribute to further understanding of the mechanism of bud dormancy in Japanese apricot.
