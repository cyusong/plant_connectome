['25211338', 'Day-length is important for regulating the transition to reproductive development  (flowering) in plants. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the transcription  factor CONSTANS (CO) promotes expression of the florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT),  constituting a key flowering pathway under long-day photoperiods. Recent studies  have revealed that FT expression is regulated by changes of histone modification  marks of the FT chromatin, but the epigenetic regulators that directly interact  with the CO protein have not been identified. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis  Morf Related Gene (MRG) group proteins MRG1 and MRG2 act as H3K4me3/H3K36me3  readers and physically interact with CO to activate FT expression. In vitro  binding analyses indicated that the chromodomains of MRG1 and MRG2 preferentially  bind H3K4me3/H3K36me3 peptides. The mrg1 mrg2 double mutant exhibits reduced mRNA  levels of FT, but not of CO, and shows a late-flowering phenotype under the  long-day but not short-day photoperiod growth conditions. MRG2 associates with  the chromatin of FT promoter in a way dependent of both CO and H3K4me3/H3K36me3.  Vice versa, loss of MRG1 and MRG2 also impairs CO binding at the FT promoter.  Crystal structure analyses of MRG2 bound with H3K4me3/H3K36me3 peptides together  with mutagenesis analysis in planta further demonstrated that MRG2 function  relies on its H3K4me3/H3K36me3-binding activity. Collectively, our results  unravel a novel chromatin regulatory mechanism, linking functions of MRG1 and  MRG2 proteins, H3K4/H3K36 methylations, and CO in FT activation in the  photoperiodic regulation of flowering time in plants.', '2014 Sep', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1004617', 'Dong']
