In plants exhibiting crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), CAM photosynthesis almost always occurs together with C3 photosynthesis, and occasionally with C4 photosynthesis. Depending on species, ontogeny, and environment, CAM input to total carbon gain can vary from values of <1% to 100%. The wide range of CAM phenotypes between and within species is a fascinating example of functional diversity and plasticity, but poses a significant challenge when attempting to define CAM. CO2 gas exchange experiments designed for this review illustrate key patterns of CAM expression and highlight distinguishing features of constitutive and facultative CAM. Furthermore, they help to address frequently recurring questions on CAM terminology. The functional and evolutionary significance of contrasting CAM phenotypes and of intermediate states between extremes is discussed. Results from a study on nocturnal malate accumulation in 50 species of Aizoaceae exposed to drought and salinity stress suggest that facultative CAM is more widespread amongst vascular plants than previously thought.
