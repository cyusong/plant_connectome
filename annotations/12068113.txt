['12068113', 'AtWRKY18 is a pathogen- and salicylic acid-induced Arabidopsis transcription  factor containing the plant-specific WRKY zinc finger DNA-binding motif. In the  present study, we have transformed Arabidopsis plants with AtWRKY18 under control  of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Surprisingly, transgenic plants  expressing high levels of AtWRKY18 were stunted in growth. When expressed at  moderate levels, AtWRKY18 potentiated developmentally regulated defense responses  in transgenic plants without causing substantial negative effects on plant  growth. As they grew from seedling to mature stages, transgenic AtWRKY18 plant  showed marked increase in the expression of pathogenesis-related genes and  resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, whereas wild-type  plants exhibited little enhancement in these defense responses. Potentiation of  developmentally regulated defense responses by AtWRKY18 was not associated with  enhanced biosynthesis of salicylic acid but required the disease resistance  regulatory protein NPR1/NIM1. Thus, AtWRKY18 can positively modulate  defense-related gene expression and disease resistance. To study the regulated  expression of AtWRKY18, we have identified a cluster of WRKY binding sites in the  promoter of the gene and demonstrated that they acted as negative regulatory  elements for the inducible expression of AtWRKY18. These negative cis-acting  elements may prevent overexpression of AtWRKY18 during the activation of plant  defense responses that could be detrimental to plant growth as inferred from the  transgenic plants ectopically expressing the transgene.', '2002 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.001057', 'Chen']
