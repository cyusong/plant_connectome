Fungi cause severe diseases on a broad range of crop and ornamental plants, leading to significant economical losses. Plant pathogenic fungi exhibit a huge variability in their mode of infection, differentiation and function of infection structures and nutritional strategy. In this review, advances in understanding mechanisms of biotrophy, necrotrophy and hemibiotrophic lifestyles are described. Special emphasis is given to the biotrophy-necrotrophy switch of hemibiotrophic pathogens, and to biosynthesis, chemical diversity and mode of action of various fungal toxins produced during the infection process.
