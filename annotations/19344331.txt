This study identified the role of CO in regulating the tomato root hair development. Exogenous CO promoted the root hair density and elongation in a concentration-dependent manner. Analysis of cross sections of primary roots also indicated that CO induced the formation of root hairs. Genetic analysis reveals that tomato mutant yg-2 (defective in haem oxygenase-1 activity and intracellular CO generation) displayed a phenotype of delayed root hair development, which however could be reversed by exogenous CO. Further, we analysed LeExt1::beta-glucuronidase reporter gene for root hair formation and found increasing expression of LeExt1 in the CO-exposed root hairs. Finally, CO was able to act synergistically with auxin, ethylene and NO. It is shown that the effect of CO could be blocked by NPA (auxin transport inhibitor), AVG (ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor), Ag(+) (ethylene action inhibitor) or cPTIO (NO scavenger). Exposure of tomato roots to CO also enhanced intracellular NO and reactive oxygen species generation in root hairs. Our results suggest that CO would be required for root hair development and may play a critical role in controlling architectural development of plant roots by a putative mechanism of cross-talk with auxin, ethylene and nitric oxide.
