Flowering plants display a vast diversity of inflorescence architecture, which plays an important role in determining seed yield and fruit production. Unlike the model eudicot Arabidopsis thaliana that has simple inflorescences, most legume plants have compound types of inflorescences. Recent studies in the model legume species Pisum sativum and Medicago truncatula showed that the MADS-box transcription factors VEGETATIVE1/PsFRUITFULc/MtFRUITFULc (VEG1/PsFULc and MtFULc) are essential for the development of compound inflorescences by specifying the secondary inflorescence meristem identity. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of two new mtfulc alleles by screening the M. truncatula Tnt1 insertion mutant collection. We found that MtFULc specifies M. truncatula secondary inflorescence meristem identity in a dose-dependent manner. Biochemical analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that MtFULc acts as a transcriptional repressor to directly repress the expression of MtTFL1 through its promoter and 3' intergenic region. Comprehensive genetic analysis suggest MtFULc coordinates with the primary inflorescence meristem maintainer MtTFL1 and floral meristem regulator MtPIM to control M. truncatula inflorescence development. Our findings help to elucidate the mechanism of MtFULc-mediated regulation of secondary inflorescence meristem identity and provide insights into understanding the genetic regulatory network underlying compound inflorescence development in legumes.
