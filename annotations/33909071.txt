The primary root is critical for early seedling growth and survival. To understand the molecular mechanisms governing primary root development, we performed a dynamic transcriptome analysis of two maize (Zea mays) inbred lines with contrasting primary root length at nine time points over a 12-day period. A total of 18 702 genes were differentially expressed between two lines or different time points. Gene enrichment, phytohormone content determination, and metabolomics analysis showed that auxin biosynthesis and signal transduction, as well as the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways, were associated with root development. Co-expression network analysis revealed that eight modules were associated with lines/stages, as well as primary or lateral root length. In root-related modules, flavonoid metabolism accompanied by auxin biosynthesis and signal transduction constituted a complex gene regulatory network during primary root development. Two candidate genes (rootless concerning crown and seminal roots, rtcs and Zm00001d012781) involved in auxin signaling and flavonoid biosynthesis were identified by co-expression network analysis, QTL-seq and functional annotation. These results increase our understanding of the regulatory network controlling the development of primary and lateral root length, and provide a valuable genetic resource for improvement of root performance in maize.
