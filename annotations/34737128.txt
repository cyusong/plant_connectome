The spring shoot leaves are important sites of nitrogen (N) metabolism in citrus trees. Understanding the physiological and metabolic response of the spring shoot leaves under varying N fertilization is fundamental to the fertilization management in citrus orchards. Thus, the processes affecting N composition, the activities of N metabolism related enzymes, and the expression of relevant genes were explored in spring shoot leaves under four N levels (0, 207, 275, 413 g N tree<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, as N0, N207, N275, N413). The results showed that, compared with N0, N275 significantly increased total N by 24.81%, which was mainly attributed to enhancement of structural N by 30.92%, free amino acid N by 40.91% and nitrate N by 41.33%. The relative expression of nitrate reductase (NR) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) under N275 increased by 19.32% and 73.48%, respectively, compared with that under N0 treatment. Compared with N0 treatment, the NR transcription level under N275 treatment increased by 381%. The relative transcription levels of NADP-GDH and GDH1 also increased with increasing N fertilization. However, compared with that under N275, the relative transcription of GDH2 under N413 treatment was inhibited. Therefore, the transcript abundance of NR, NADP-GDH,GDH1 and GDH2 affected the activities of NR and GDH and thereby contributed to the regulation of N composition in the leaves. In addition, the activities of glutamine synthetase and nitrite reductase were largely unaffected or even declined in the N207, N275 and N413 treatments compared with the N0. This study elucidated the mechanism of primary N metabolism and partitioning in citrus leaves and provided a theoretical basis for N management in citrus orchards.
