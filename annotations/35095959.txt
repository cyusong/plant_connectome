Understanding the genetic basis of polygenic traits is a major challenge in agricultural species, especially in non-model systems. Select and sequence (SnS) experiments carried out within existing breeding programs provide a means to simultaneously identify the genomic background of a trait while improving the mean phenotype for a population. Using pooled whole genome sequencing (WGS) of selected and unselected bulks derived from a synthetic outcrossing sugar beet population EL57 (PI 663212), which segregates for seedling rhizoctonia resistance, we identified a putative genomic background involved in conditioning a resistance phenotype. Population genomic parameters were estimated to measure fixation (<i>He</i>), genome divergence (<i>F</i> <sub><i>ST</i></sub> ), and allele frequency changes between bulks (DeltaAF). We report on the genome wide patterns of variation resulting from selection and highlight specific genomic features associated with resistance. Expected heterozygosity (<i>He</i>) showed an increased level of fixation in the resistant bulk, indicating a greater selection pressure was applied. In total, 1,311 biallelic loci were detected as significant F<sub>ST</sub> outliers (<i>p</i> < 0.01) in comparisons between the resistant and susceptible bulks. These loci were detected in 206 regions along the chromosomes and contained 275 genes. We estimated changes in allele frequency between bulks resulting from selection for resistance by leveraging the allele frequencies of an unselected bulk. DeltaAF was a more stringent test of selection and recovered 186 significant loci, representing 32 genes, all of which were also detected using F<sub>ST</sub>. Estimates of population genetic parameters and statistical significance were visualized with respect to the EL10.2 physical map and produced a candidate gene list that was enriched for function in cell wall metabolism and plant disease resistance, including pathogen perception, signal transduction, and pathogen response. Specific variation associated with these genes was also reported and represents genetic markers for validation and prediction of resistance to Rhizoctonia. Select and sequence experiments offer a means to characterize the genetic base of sugar beet, inform selection within breeding programs, and prioritize candidate variation for functional studies.
