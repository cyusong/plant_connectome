['32185689', 'The four phylogenetically closely related ERF102 to ERF105 transcription factors  of Arabidopsis thaliana are regulated by different stresses and are involved in  the response to cold stress. The ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) genes of  Arabidopsis thaliana form a large family encoding plant-specific transcription  factors. Here, we characterise the four phylogenetically closely related  ERF102/ERF5, ERF103/ERF6, ERF104 and ERF105 genes. Expression analyses revealed  that these four genes are similarly regulated by different hormones and abiotic  stresses. Analyses of tissue-specific expression using promoter:GUS reporter  lines revealed their predominant expression in root tissues including the root  meristem (ERF103), the quiescent center (ERF104) and the root vasculature (all).  All GFP-ERF fusion proteins were nuclear-localised. The analysis of insertional  mutants, amiRNA lines and 35S:ERF overexpressing transgenic lines indicated that  ERF102 to ERF105 have only a limited impact on regulating shoot and root growth.  Previous work had shown a role for ERF105 in the cold stress response. Here,  measurement of electrolyte leakage to determine leaf freezing tolerance and  expression analyses of cold-responsive genes revealed that the combined activity  of ERF102 and ERF103 is also required for a full cold acclimation response likely  involving the CBF regulon. These results suggest a common function of these ERF  genes in the response to cold stress.', '2020 Jun', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-020-00993-1', 'ORCID:']
