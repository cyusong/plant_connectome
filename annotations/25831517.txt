Unilateral interspecific incompatibility (UI) is a postpollination, prezygotic reproductive barrier that prevents hybridization between related species when the female parent is self-incompatible (SI) and the male parent is self-compatible (SC). In tomato and related Solanum species, two genes, ui1.1 and ui6.1, are required for pollen compatibility on pistils of SI species or hybrids. We previously showed that ui6.1 encodes a Cullin1 (CUL1) protein. Here we report that ui1.1 encodes an S-locus F-box (SLF) protein. The ui1.1 gene was mapped to a 0.43-cM, 43.2-Mbp interval at the S-locus on chromosome 1, but positional cloning was hampered by low recombination frequency. We hypothesized that ui1.1 encodes an SLF protein(s) that interacts with CUL1 and Skp1 proteins to form an SCF-type (Skp1, Cullin1, F-box) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. We identified 23 SLF genes in the S. pennellii genome, of which 19 were also represented in cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum). Data from recombination events, expression analysis, and sequence annotation highlighted 11 S. pennellii genes as candidates. Genetic transformations demonstrated that one of these, SpSLF-23, is sufficient for ui1.1 function. A survey of cultivated and wild tomato species identified SLF-23 orthologs in each of the SI species, but not in the SC species S. lycopersicum, S. cheesmaniae, and S. galapagense, pollen of which lacks ui1.1 function. These results demonstrate that pollen compatibility in UI is mediated by protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a mechanism related to that which controls pollen recognition in SI.
