['25913773', 'Biotic and abiotic stress responses of plants are linked to developmental  programs. Proteins involved in different signaling pathways are the molecular  basis of this concerted interplay. In our study, we show that Arabidopsis  thaliana HEAVY METAL-ASSOCIATED ISOPRENYLATED PLANT PROTEIN3 (HIPP3; At5g60800)  acts as an upstream regulator of stress- and development-related regulatory  networks. Localization, metal-binding and stress-responsive gene expression of  HIPP3 were analyzed via microscopy, protein and inductively coupled plasma  (ICP)-MS analyses and quantitative real-time PCR. In addition, transcriptome and  phenotype analyses of plants overexpressing HIPP3 were used to unravel its  function. Our data show that HIPP3 is a nuclear, zinc-binding protein. It is  repressed during drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment and, similar to  other pathogen-related genes, is induced after infection with Pseudomonas  syringae pv. tomato. HIPP3 overexpression affects the regulation of > 400 genes.  Strikingly, most of these genes are involved in pathogen response, especially in  the salicylate pathway. In addition, many genes of abiotic stress responses and  seed and flower development are affected by HIPP3 overexpression. Plants  overexpressing HIPP3 show delayed flowering. We conclude that HIPP3 acts via its  bound zinc as an upstream regulator of the salicylate-dependent pathway of  pathogen response and is also involved in abiotic stress responses and seed and  flower development.', '2015 Sep', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13419', 'Humbeck']
