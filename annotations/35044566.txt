We identified a typical rice premature senescence leaf mutant 86 (psl86) and exhibited the first global ubiquitination data during rice leaf senescence. Premature leaf senescence affects the yield and quality of rice, causing irreparable agricultural economic losses. In this study, we reported a rice premature senescence leaf mutant 86 (psl86) in the population lines of rice (Oryza sativa) japonica cultivar 'Yunyin' (YY) mutagenized using ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) treatment. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that a higher ubiquitination level in the psl86 mutant compared with YY. Thus, we performed the proteome and ubiquitylome analyses to identify the differential abundance proteins and ubiquitinated proteins (sites) related to leaf senescence. Among 885 quantified lysine ubiquitination (Kub) sites in 492 proteins, 116 sites in 94 proteins were classified as up-regulated targets and seven sites in six proteins were classified as down-regulated targets at a threshold of 1.5. Proteins with up-regulated Kub sites were mainly enriched in the carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Notably, 14 up-regulated Kub sites in 11 proteins were enriched in the carbon fixation in photosynthetic organism pathway, and seven proteins (rbcL, PGK, GAPA, FBA5, ALDP, CFBP1 and GGAT) were down-regulated, indicating this pathway is tightly regulated by ubiquitination during leaf senescence. To our knowledge, we present the first global data on ubiquitination during rice leaf senescence.
