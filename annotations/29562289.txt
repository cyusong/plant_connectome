In flowering plants, various RNA editing events occur in the mitochondria and chloroplasts as part of post-transcriptional processes. Although several pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins and multiple organellar RNA editing factors (MORFs) have been identified as RNA editing factors, the underlying mechanism of PPRs and the cooperation among these proteins are still obscure. Here, we identified a rice dual-localized PPR protein, OsPGL1. The loss of function of OsPGL1 resulted in defects in both chloroplast RNA editing of ndhD-878 and mitochondrial RNA editing of ccmFc-543, both of which could be restored in transgenic complementation lines. Despite synonymous editing of ccmFc-543, the loss of editing of ndhD-878 caused a failed conversion of serine to leucine, leading to chloroplast dysfunction and defects in the photosynthetic complex; the results of additional experiments demonstrated that OsPGL1 directly binds to both transcripts. Interactions between three OsMORFs (OsMORF2/8/9) and OsPGL1 both in vitro and in vivo were confirmed, implying that OsPGL1 functions in RNA editing via an editosome. These findings also suggested that OsMORFs assist with and contribute to a flexible PPR-RNA recognition model during RNA editing. These results indicate that, in cooperation with PPRs, OsPGL1 is required for RNA editing. In addition, our study provides new insights into the relationship between RNA editing and plant development.
