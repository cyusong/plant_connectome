The plant-specific lateral organ boundaries (LOB) domain (LBD) proteins, a family of transcription factors, play important roles in plant growth and development, as well as in responses to various stresses. However, little is known about the functions of <i>LBD</i> genes in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). In this study, we investigated the evolution and classification of the LBD family in soybean by a phylogenetic tree of the <i>LBD</i> gene family from 16 species. Phylogenetic analysis categorized these proteins into two classes (Class I and Class II) with seven subgroups. Moreover, we found that all the 18 <i>LBD</i> ancestors in angiosperm were kept in soybean, common bean genomes, and genome-wide duplication, suggesting the main force for the expansion of LBD from common bean to soybean. Analysis of gene expression profiling data indicated that 16 <i>GmLBD</i> genes were significantly induced at different time points after inoculation of soybean plants (cv. Huachun 6) with <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> (<i>P. sojae</i>). We further assessed the role of four highly upregulated genes, <i>GmLBD9</i>, <i>GmLBD16</i>, <i>GmLBD23</i>, and <i>GmLBD88</i>, in plant defense in soybean hairy roots using the transient overexpression and knockdown assays. The results showed that <i>GmLBD9</i> and <i>GmLBD23</i> negatively regulate plant immunity against <i>P. sojae</i>, whereas <i>GmLBD16</i> and <i>GmLBD88</i> positively manipulate plant immunity against <i>P. sojae</i>. Collectively, our findings expand our knowledge of the origin and evolution of the <i>GmLBD</i> gene family in soybean and promote the potential application of these genes in soybean genetic improvement.
