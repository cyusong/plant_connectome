Jasmonic acid (JA) is shown to induce leaf senescence. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood, especially in woody plants such as fruit trees. In this study, we are interested in exploring the biological role of MdBT2 in JA-mediated leaf senescence. We found that MdBT2 played an antagonistic role in MdMYC2-promoted leaf senescence. Our results revealed that MdBT2 interacted with MdMYC2 and accelerated its ubiquitination degradation, thus negatively regulated MdMYC2-promoted leaf senescence. In addition, MdBT2 acted as a stabilizing factor to improve the stability of MdJAZ2 through direct interaction, thereby inhibited JA-mediated leaf senescence. Furthermore, our results also showed that MdBT2 interacted with a subset of JAZ proteins in apple, including MdJAZ1, MdJAZ3, MdJAZ4 and MdJAZ8. Our investigations provide new insight into molecular mechanisms of JA-modulated leaf senescence. The dynamic JA-MdBT2-MdJAZ2-MdMYC2 regulatory module plays an important role in JA-modulated leaf senescence.
