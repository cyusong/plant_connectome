['31826964', 'The nuclear pore complex profoundly affects the timing of flowering; however, the  underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that Nucleoporin96  (Nup96) acts as a negative regulator of long-day photoperiodic flowering in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Through multiple approaches, we identified  the E3 ubiquitin ligase HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE1 (HOS1)  and demonstrated its interaction in vivo with Nup96. Nup96 and HOS1 mainly  localize and interact on the nuclear membrane. Loss of function of Nup96 leads to  destruction of HOS1 proteins without a change in their mRNA abundance, which  results in overaccumulation of the key activator of long-day photoperiodic  flowering, CONSTANS (CO) proteins, as previously reported in hos1 mutants.  Unexpectedly, mutation of HOS1 strikingly diminishes Nup96 protein level,  suggesting that Nup96 and HOS1 are mutually stabilized and thus form a novel  repressive module that regulates CO protein turnover. Therefore, the nup96 and  hos1 single and nup96 hos1 double mutants have highly similar early-flowering  phenotypes and overlapping transcriptome changes. Together, this study reveals a  repression mechanism in which the Nup96-HOS1 repressive module gates the level of  CO proteins and thereby prevents precocious flowering in long-day conditions.', '2020 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00661', 'ORCID:']
