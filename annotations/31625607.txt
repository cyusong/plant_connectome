Despite having a network of cytoplasmic interconnections (plasmodesmata) facilitating rapid exchange of metabolites and signal molecules, plant cells use the extracellular matrix as an alternative route for cell-cell communication. The need for extracellular signalling in plasmodesmata-networked tissues is baffling. A hypothesis is proposed that this phenomenon defines the plant extracellular matrix as a 'democratic space' for collective decision-making in a decentralized system, similar to quorum-sensing in bacteria. Extracellular communication enables signal integration and coordination across several cell layers through ligand-activated plasma membrane receptors. Recent results from drought stress-adaptive responses and light-mediated signalling in cell death activation show operational utility of this decision-making process. Opportunities are discussed for new innovations in drought gene discovery using platforms targeting the extracellular matrix.
