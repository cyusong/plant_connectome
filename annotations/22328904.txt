Light is an essential source of energy for life on Earth and is one of the most important signals that organisms use to obtain information from the surrounding environment, on land and in the oceans. Prominent marine microalgae, such as diatoms, display a suite of sophisticated responses (physiological, biochemical, and behavioural) to optimize their photosynthesis and growth under changing light conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling diatom responses to light are still largely unknown. Recent progress in marine diatom genomics and genetics, combined with well-established (eco) physiological and biophysical approaches, now offers novel opportunities to address these issues. This review provides a description of the molecular components identified in diatom genomes that are involved in light perception and acclimation mechanisms. How the initial functional characterizations of specific light regulators provide the basis to investigate the conservation or diversification of light-mediated processes in diatoms is also discussed. Hypotheses on the role of the identified factors in determining the growth, distribution, and adaptation of diatoms in different marine environments are reported.
