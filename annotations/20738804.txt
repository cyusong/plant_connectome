['20738804', 'Chloroplast biogenesis is tightly linked with embryogenesis and seedling  development. A growing body of work has been done on the molecular mechanisms  underlying chloroplast development; however, the molecular components involved in  chloroplast biogenesis during embryogenesis remain largely uncharacterized. In  this paper, we show that an Arabidopsis mutant carrying a T-DNA insertion in a  gene encoding a multiple membrane occupation and recognition nexus  (MORN)-containing protein exhibits severe defects during embryogenesis, producing  abnormal embryos and thereby leading to a lethality of young seedlings. Genetic  and microscopic studies reveal that the mutation is allelic to a previously  designated Arabidopsis embryo-defective 1211 mutant (emb1211). The emb1211 +/-  mutant plants produce approximately 25% of white-colored ovules with abnormal  embryos since late globular stage when primary chloroplast biogenesis takes  place, while the wild-type plants produce all green ovules. Transmission electron  microscopic analysis reveals the absence of normal chloroplast development, both  in the mutant embryos and in the mutant seedlings, that contributes to the  albinism. The EMB1211 gene is preferentially expressed in developing embryos as  revealed in the EMB1211::GUS transgenic plants. Taken together, the data indicate  that EMB1211 has an important role during embryogenesis and chloroplast  biogenesis in Arabidopsis.', '2010 Dec', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/j.1399-3054.2010.01407.x', 'Zhang']
