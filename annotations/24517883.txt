['24517883', 'Bundle sheath (BS) cells form a single cell layer surrounding the vascular tissue  in leaves. In C3 plants, photosynthesis occurs in both the BS and mesophyll  cells, but the BS cells are the major sites of photosynthesis in C4 plants,  whereas the mesophyll cells are only involved in CO2 fixation. Because C4 plants  are more efficient photosynthetically, introduction of the C4 mechanism into C3  plants is considered a key strategy to improve crop yield. One prerequisite for  such C3-to-C4 engineering is the ability to manipulate the number and physiology  of the BS cells, but the molecular basis of BS cell-fate specification remains  unclear. Here we report that mutations in three GRAS family transcription  factors, SHORT-ROOT (SHR), SCARECROW (SCR) and SCARECROW-LIKE 23 (SCL23), affect  BS cell fate in Arabidopsis thaliana. SCR and SCL23 are expressed specifically in  the BS cells and act redundantly in BS cell-fate specification, but their  expression pattern and function diverge at later stages of leaf development.  Using ChIP-chip experiments and sugar assays, we show that SCR is primarily  involved in sugar transport whereas SCL23 functions in mineral transport. SHR is  also essential for BS cell-fate specification, but it is expressed in the central  vascular tissue. However, the SHR protein moves into the BS cells, where it  directly regulates SCR and SCL23 expression. SHR, SCR and SCL23 homologs are  present in many plant species, suggesting that this developmental pathway for BS  cell-fate specification is likely to be evolutionarily conserved.', '2014 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12470', 'Hao']
