['11516153', 'In the sequences released by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI), we have  discovered a new large gene family (48 genes as of July 2000). A detailed  computational and biochemical analysis of the predicted gene products reveals a  novel family of plant F-box proteins, where the amino (N)-terminal F-box motif is  followed by four kelch repeats and a characteristic carboxy-terminal domain.  F-box proteins are an expanding family of eukaryotic proteins, which have been  shown in some cases to be critical for the controlled degradation of cellular  regulatory proteins via the ubiquitin pathway. The F-box motif of the At5g48990  gene product, a member of the family, was shown to be functionally active by its  ability to mediate the in vitro interaction between At5g48990 and ASK1 proteins.  F-box proteins specifically recruit the targets to be ubiquitinated, mainly  through protein-protein interaction modules such as WD-40 domains or leucine-rich  repeats (LRRs). The kelch repeats of the family described here form a potential  protein-protein interaction domain, as molecular modelling of the kelch repeats  according to the galactose oxidase crystal structure (the only solved structure  containing kelch repeats) predicts a beta-propeller. The identification of this  family of F-box proteins greatly expands the field of plant F-box proteins and  suggests that controlled degradation of cellular proteins via the ubiquitin  pathway could play a critical role in multiple plant cellular processes.', '2001 Jul', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1010650809272', 'Rodriguez']
