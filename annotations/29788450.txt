Callus formation in tissue culture follows the rooting pathway, and newly formed callus seems to be a group of root primordium-like cells. However, it is not clear whether there are multiple mechanisms of callus initiation in different species and in different organs. Here we show that the OsIAA11-mediated pathway is specifically and strictly required for callus initiation in the lateral root (LR) formation region of the primary root (PR) but not for callus initiation at the root tip or the stem base in rice. OsIAA11 and its Arabidopsis homolog AtIAA14 are key players in lateral rooting. However, the AtIAA14-mediated pathway is not strictly required for callus initiation in the LR formation region in Arabidopsis. LRs can be initiated through either the AtIAA14-mediated or AtWOX11-mediated pathway in the Arabidopsis PR, therefore providing optional pathways for callus initiation. In contrast, OsIAA11 is strictly required for lateral rooting in the rice PR, meaning that the OsIAA11 pathway is the only choice for callus initiation. Our study suggests that multiple pathways may converge to WOX5 activation during callus formation in different organs and different species.
