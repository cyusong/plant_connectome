Iron (Fe) homeostasis is essential for both plant development and human nutrition. The maintenance of Fe homeostasis involves a complex network in which Fe signaling nodes and circuits coordinate tightly Fe transporters, ferric reductases, H<sup>+</sup> -ATPases, low-molecular-mass metal chelators, and transporters of chelators and Fe-chelate complexes. Early-stage studies have revealed different strategies for Fe homeostasis between graminaceous and nongraminaceous plants. Recent progress has refreshed our understanding of previous knowledge, especially on the uptake, phloem transport and systemic signaling of Fe. This review attempts to summarize recent exciting and potentially influential studies on the various routes of Fe uptake and distribution in plants, focusing on breakthroughs that have changed our understanding of plant Fe nutrition.
