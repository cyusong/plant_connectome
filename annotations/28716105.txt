The error-free branch of the DNA-damage tolerance (DDT) pathway is orchestrated by Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and this polyubiquitination is mediated by a Ubc13-Uev complex in yeast. We have previously cloned OsUBC13 from rice, whose product functions as an E2 to promote Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain assembly in the presence of yeast or human Uev. Here we identify four highly conserved UEV1 genes in rice whose products are able to form stable heterodimers with OsUbc13 and mediate Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain assembly. Expression of OsUEV1s is able to rescue the yeast mms2 mutant from death caused by DNA-damaging agents. Interestingly, OsUev1A contains a unique C-terminal tail with a conserved prenylation site not found in the other three OsUev1s, and this post-translational modification appears to be required for its unique subcellular distribution and association with the membrane. The analysis of OsUEV1 expression profiles obtained from the Genevestigator database indicates that these genes are differentially regulated. We speculate that different OsUev1s play distinct roles by serving as a regulatory subunit of the Ubc13-Uev1 complex to respond to diverse cellular, developmental and environmental signals.
