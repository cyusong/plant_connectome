The flowering time of higher plants is controlled by environmental cues and intrinsic signals. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), flowering is accelerated by exposure to long-day conditions via the key photoperiod-induced factor FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Nuclear Factor-Y subunit C (NF-YC) proteins function as important mediators of epigenetic marks in different plant developmental stages and play an important role in the regulation of <i>FT</i> transcription, but the mechanistic details of this remain unknown. In this study, we show that Arabidopsis NF-YC homologs temporally interact with the histone methyltransferase CURLY LEAF (CLF) during the flowering transition. The binding of NF-YC antagonizes the association of CLF with chromatin and the CLF-dependent deposition of H3 lysine-27 trimethylation, thus relieving the repression of <i>FT</i> transcription and facilitating flowering under long-day conditions. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of NF-YC/CLF-mediated epigenetic regulation of <i>FT</i> activation in photoperiod-induced flowering and, consequently, contribute to our understanding of how plants control developmental events in a temporal-specific regulatory manner.
