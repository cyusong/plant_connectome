N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), which is added, removed, and interpreted by m<sup>6</sup>A writers, erasers, and readers, respectively, is the most abundant modification in eukaryotic mRNAs. The m<sup>6</sup>A marks play a pivotal role in the regulation of floral transition in plants. FLOWERING LOCUS K (FLK), an RNA-binding protein harboring K-homology (KH) motifs, is known to regulate floral transition by repressing the levels of a key floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) in Arabidopsis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the FLK-mediated FLC regulation has been unexplored. In this study, we identified FLK as a novel mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A reader protein that directly binds to the m<sup>6</sup>A site in the 3'-untranslated region of FLC transcript, thus repressing FLC levels by reducing its stability and splicing. Importantly, the binding of FLK to FLC transcript was abolished in the vir-1, an m<sup>6</sup>A writer mutant, and the late-flowering phenotype of the flk mutant was not rescued by a genetic complementation of the mutant-FLK<sup>m</sup> whose m<sup>6</sup>A reader function was eliminated, indicating that FLK binds to and regulates FLC expression in an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent manner. Collectively, our results uncover a long-standing question of how FLK regulates FLC transcript and suggest a molecular link between the FLK-mediated recognition of m<sup>6</sup>A modifications on FLC transcripts and floral transition in Arabidopsis.
