Unraveling the metabolic and phytohormonal changes in anthers exposed to heat stress would help identify mechanisms regulating heat stress tolerance during the sensitive reproductive stage. Two spring wheat genotypes contrasting for heat tolerance were exposed to heat stress during heading in controlled environment chambers. Anthers were collected from main and primary spikes for metabolic and phytohormonal profiling. A significant reduction in seed set (38%), grain number (54%) and grain weight (52%) per plant was recorded in the sensitive (KSG1177) but not in the tolerant (KSG1214) genotype under heat stress compared to control. Anther metabolite accumulation did not vary quantitatively between main and primary spikes. Hierarchical clustering of the genotypes and treatments using metabolites and phytohormones revealed a distinct cluster for KSG1177 under heat stress from that of control and KSG1214. A significant increase in N-based amino acids, ABA, IAA-conjugate and a decrease in polyamines and organic acids were observed in wheat anthers exposed to heat stress. Unlike KSG1214, a significantly higher accumulation of amino acids, ABA and IAA-conjugate in anthers of the sensitive KSG1177 was recorded under heat stress. These findings provide the rationale and direction towards developing molecular markers for enhancing heat stress tolerance in wheat.
