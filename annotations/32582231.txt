Fossil fuel sources are a limited resource and could eventually be depleted. Biofuels have emerged as a renewable alternative to fossil fuels. <i>Jatropha</i> has grown in significance as a potential bioenergy crop due to its high content of seed oil. However, <i>Jatropha</i>'s lack of high-yielding seed genotypes limits its potential use for biofuel production. The main cause of lower seed yield is the low female to male flower ratio (1:25-10), which affects the total amount of seeds produced per plant. Here, we review the genetic factors responsible for floral transitions, floral organ development, and regulated gene products in <i>Jatropha</i>. We also summarize potential gene targets to increase seed production and discuss challenges ahead.
