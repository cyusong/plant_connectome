Brassinosteroids, the steroid hormones of plants, are perceived at the plasma membrane by a leucine-rich repeat receptor serine/threonine kinase called BRI1. We report a BRI1-interacting protein, BKI1, which is a negative regulator of brassinosteroid signaling. Brassinosteroids cause the rapid dissociation of BKI1-yellow fluorescent protein from the plasma membrane in a process that is dependent on BRI1-kinase. BKI1 is a substrate of BRI1 kinase and limits the interaction of BRI1 with its proposed coreceptor, BAK1, suggesting that BKI1 prevents the activation of BRI1.
