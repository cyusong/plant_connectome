The monocot cambium is semi-storied, and its cells do not undergo rearrangement. The monocot cambium is a lateral meristem responsible for secondary growth in some monocotyledons of Asparagales. It is an unusual meristem, not homologous with the vascular cambia of gymnosperms and non-monocotyledonous angiosperms. Owing to the limited information available on the characteristics of this meristem, the aim of this study was to survey the structure of the monocot cambium in order to clarify the similarities and dissimilarities of this lateral meristem to the vascular cambium of trees. Using the serial sectioning analysis, we have studied the monocot cambium of three species of arborescent monocotyledons, i.e., Quiver Tree Aloe dichotoma, Dragon Tree Dracaena draco, and Joshua Tree Yucca brevifolia, native to different parts of the world. Data showed that in contrast to the vascular cambium, the monocot cambium is composed of a single type of short initials that vary in shape, and in tangential view display a semi-storied pattern. Furthermore, the cells of the monocot cambium do not undergo rearrangement. The criteria used in identifying monocot cambium initial cell are also discussed.
