Two OsDGAT1 genes showed the ability to restore TAG and LB synthesis in yeast H1246. Alterations in the N-terminal region of OsDGAT1-1 gene revealed its regulatory role in gene function. Accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) or oil in vegetative tissues has emerged as a promising approach to meet the global needs of food, feed, and fuel. Rice (Oryza sativa) has been recognized as an important cereal crop containing nutritional rice bran oil with high economic value for renewable energy production. To identify the key component involved in storage lipid biosynthesis, two type-1 diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1) from rice were characterized for its in vivo function in the H1246 (dga1, lro1, are1 and are2) yeast quadruple mutant. The ectopic expression of rice DGAT1 (designated as OsDGAT1-1 and OsDGAT1-2) genes restored the capability of TAG synthesis and lipid body (LB) formation in H1246. OsDGAT1-1 showed nearly equal substrate preferences to C16:0-CoA and 18:1-CoA whereas OsDGAT1-2 displayed substrate selectivity for C16:0-CoA over 18:1-CoA, indicating that these enzymes have contrasting substrate specificities. In parallel, we have identified the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) at the N-terminal domains of OsDGAT1 proteins. The regulatory role of the N-terminal domain was dissected. Single point mutations at the phosphorylation sites and truncations of the N-terminal region highlighted reduced lipid accumulation capabilities among different OsDGAT1-1 variants.
