Previous work on the adaptation of maize (Zea mays L.) primary root growth to water stress showed that cell elongation is maintained in the apical region of the growth zone but progressively inhibited further from the apex. Cell wall proteomic analysis suggested that levels of apoplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), may be modified in a region-specific manner within the growth zone of water-stressed roots. Apoplastic ROS may have wall loosening or tightening effects and may also have other growth regulatory functions. To gain an understanding of how apoplastic ROS levels change under water stress, cerium chloride staining was used in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy to examine the spatial distribution of apoplastic H2O2. The results revealed that apoplastic H2O2 levels increased specifically in the apical region of the growth zone under water stress, correlating spatially with the maintenance of cell elongation. The basal regions of the growth zone of water-stressed roots and the entire growth zone of well-watered roots exhibited relatively low levels of apoplastic H2O2. The increase in apoplastic H2O2 in the apical region under water stress probably resulted, at least in part, from a pronounced increase in oxalate oxidase activity in this region. By contrast, well-watered roots showed negligible oxalate oxidase activity throughout the growth zone. The results show that changes in apoplastic ROS levels in the root growth zone under water-deficit conditions are regulated in a spatially-specific manner, suggesting that this response may play an important role in maize root adaptation to water stress.
