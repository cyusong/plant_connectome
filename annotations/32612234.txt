['32612234', 'Plant hormones coordinate responses to environmental cues with developmental  programs(1), and are fundamental for stress resilience and agronomic yield(2).  The core signalling pathways underlying the effects of phytohormones have been  elucidated by genetic screens and hypothesis-driven approaches, and extended by  interactome studies of select pathways(3). However, fundamental questions remain  about how information from different pathways is integrated. Genetically, most  phenotypes seem to be regulated by several hormones, but transcriptional  profiling suggests that hormones trigger largely exclusive transcriptional  programs(4). We hypothesized that protein-protein interactions have an important  role in phytohormone signal integration. Here, we experimentally generated a  systems-level map of the Arabidopsis phytohormone signalling network, consisting  of more than 2,000 binary protein-protein interactions. In the highly  interconnected network, we identify pathway communities and hundreds of  previously unknown pathway contacts that represent potential points of crosstalk.  Functional validation of candidates in seven hormone pathways reveals new  functions for 74% of tested proteins in 84% of candidate interactions, and  indicates that a large majority of signalling proteins function pleiotropically  in several pathways. Moreover, we identify several hundred largely  small-molecule-dependent interactions of hormone receptors. Comparison with  previous reports suggests that noncanonical and nontranscription-mediated  receptor signalling is more common than hitherto appreciated.', '2020 Jul', 'Nature', '10.1038/s41586-020-2460-0', 'ORCID:']
