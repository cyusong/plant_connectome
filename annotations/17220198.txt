['17220198', 'During cell division, the mitotic spindle partitions chromosomes into daughter  nuclei. In higher plants, the molecular mechanisms governing spindle assembly and  function remain largely unexplored. Here, live cell imaging of mitosis in  Arabidopsis thaliana plants lacking a kinesin-14 (ATK5) reveals defects during  early spindle formation. Beginning during prophase and lasting until late  prometaphase, spindles of atk5-1 plants become abnormally elongated, are  frequently bent, and have splayed poles by prometaphase. The period of spindle  elongation during prophase and prometaphase is prolonged in atk5-1 cells.  Time-lapse imaging of yellow fluorescent protein:ATK5 reveals colocalization with  perinuclear microtubules before nuclear envelope breakdown, after which it  congresses inward from the poles to the midzone, where it becomes progressively  enriched at regions of overlap between antiparallel microtubules. In vitro  microtubule motility assays demonstrate that in the presence of ATK5, two  microtubules encountering one another at an angle can interact and coalign,  forming a linear bundle. These data indicate that ATK5 participates in the search  and capture of antiparallel interpolar microtubules, where it aids in generating  force to coalign microtubules, thereby affecting spindle length, width, and  integrity.', '2007 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.047613', 'Cyr']
