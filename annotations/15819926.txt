Some green orchids obtain carbon (C) from their mycorrhizal fungi and photosynthesis. This mixotrophy may represent an evolutionary step towards mycoheterotrophic plants fully feeding on fungal C. Here, we report on nonphotosynthetic individuals (albinos) of the green Cephalanthera damasonium that likely represent another evolutionary step. Albino and green individuals from a French population were compared for morphology and fertility, photosynthetic abilities, fungal partners (using microscopy and molecular tools), and nutrient sources (as characterized by 15N and 13C abundances). Albinos did not differ significantly from green individuals in morphology and fertility, but tended to be smaller. They harboured similar fungi, with Thelephoraceae and Cortinariaceae as mycorrhizal partners and few rhizoctonias. Albinos were nonphotosynthetic, fully mycoheterotrophic. Green individuals carried out photosynthesis at compensation point and received almost 50% of their C from fungi. Orchid fungi also colonized surrounding tree roots, likely to be the ultimate C source. Transition to mycoheterotrophy may require several simultaneous adaptations; albinos, by lacking some of them, may have reduced ecological success. This may limit the appearance of cheaters in mycorrhizal networks.
