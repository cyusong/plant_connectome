Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae secretes a number of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) whose purified preparations induce defense responses in rice. These defense responses are suppressed by X. oryzae pv. oryzae using type 3 secretion system (T3SS) effectors and a type 3 secretion system mutant (T3SS(-)) of X. oryzae pv. oryzae is an inducer of rice defense responses. We assessed the role of individual CWDEs in induction of rice defense responses during infection, by mutating them in the genetic background of a T3SS(-). We mutated the genes for five different plant CWDEs secreted by X. oryzae pv. oryzae, including two cellulases (clsA and cbsA), one xylanase (xyn), one pectinase (pglA), and an esterase (lipA), singly in a T3SS(-) background. We have demonstrated that, as compared with a T3SS(-) of X. oryzae pv. oryzae, a cbsA(-)T3SS(-), a clsA(-)T3SS(-), and a xyn(-)T3SS(-) are deficient in induction of rice immune responses such as callose deposits and programmed cell death. In comparison, a lipA(-) T3SS(-) and a pglA(-)T3SS(-) is as efficient in induction of host defense responses as a T3SS(-). Overall, these results indicate that the collective action of X. oryzae pv. oryzae-secreted ClsA, CbsA, and Xyn proteins is required for induction of rice defense responses during infection.
