['32913045', "Ribosome biogenesis is crucial for cellular metabolism and has important  implications for disease and aging. Human (Homo sapiens) glioma tumor-suppressor  candidate region gene2 (GLTSCR2) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Nucleolar  protein53 (Nop53) are orthologous proteins with demonstrated roles as ribosome  biogenesis factors; knockdown of GLTSCR2 impairs maturation of 18S and 5.8S  ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and Nop53 is required for maturation of 5.8S and 25S  rRNAs. Here, we characterized SMALL ORGAN4 (SMO4), the most likely ortholog of  human GLTSCR2 and yeast Nop53 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Loss of  function of SMO4 results in a mild morphological phenotype; however, we found  that smo4 mutants exhibit strong cytological and molecular phenotypes: nucleolar  hypertrophy and disorganization, overaccumulation of 5.8S and 18S rRNA  precursors, and an imbalanced 40S:60S ribosome subunit ratio. Like yeast Nop53  and human GLTSCR2, Arabidopsis SMO4 participates in 5.8S rRNA maturation. In  yeast, Nop53 cooperates with mRNA transport4 (Mtr4) for 5.8S rRNA maturation. In  Arabidopsis, we found that SMO4 plays similar roles in the 5.8S rRNA maturation  pathway than those described for MTR4. However, SMO4 seems not to participate in  the degradation of by-products derived from the 5'-external transcribed spacer  (ETS) of 45S pre-rRNA, as MTR4 does.", '2020 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.01540', 'ORCID:']
