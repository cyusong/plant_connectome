The basal land plant Marchantia polymorpha efficiently propagates in favourable environments through clonal progeny called gemmae. Gemmae develop in cup-shaped receptacles known as gemma cups, which are formed on the gametophyte body. Anatomical studies have described the developmental processes involved over a century ago; however, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Recent studies have started to unravel the mechanism underlying genetic and hormonal regulation of gemma cup and gemma development, showing that it shares some regulatory mechanisms with several sporophytic organs in angiosperms. Further study of these specialized organs will contribute to our understanding of the core regulatory modules underlying organ development in land plants and how these became so diversified morphologically over the course of evolution.
