The dynamic assembly of SKP1•CUL1•F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligases is important for protein ubiquitination and degradation. This process is enabled by CAND1, which exchanges F-box proteins associated with the common CUL1 scaffold, and thereby, recycles the limited CUL1 core and allows diverse F-box proteins to assemble active SCFs. Previous human cell biological and computational studies have led to the adaptive exchange hypothesis, which suggests that the CAND1-mediated exchange confers plasticity on the SCF system, allowing cells to tolerate large variations in F-box protein expression. Here, we tested this hypothesis using <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, a multicellular organism expressing hundreds of F-box protein genes at variable levels in different tissues. The <i>cand1</i> null mutant in <i>Arabidopsis</i> is viable but produce almost no seeds. Bioinformatic, cell biological, and developmental analyses revealed that the low fertility in the <i>cand1</i> mutant is associated with cell death in pollen, where the net expression of F-box protein genes is significantly higher than any other <i>Arabidopsis</i> tissue. In addition, we show that the transmission efficiency of the <i>cand1</i> null allele was reduced through the male but not the female gametophyte. Our results suggest that CAND1 activity is essential in cells or tissues expressing high levels of F-box proteins. This finding is consistent with the proposed adaptive exchange hypothesis, demonstrating the necessity of the evolutionarily conserved CAND1-mediated exchange system in the development of a multicellular organism.
