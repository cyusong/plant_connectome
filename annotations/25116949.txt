['25116949', 'Flavonoids are the most important pigments for the coloration of flowers and  seeds. In plant cells, flavonoids are synthesized by a multi-enzyme complex  located on the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, and they  accumulate in vacuoles. Two non-exclusive pathways have been proposed to mediate  flavonoid transport to vacuoles: the membrane transporter-mediated pathway and  the vesicle trafficking-mediated pathway. No molecules involved in the vesicle  trafficking-mediated pathway have been identified, however. Here, we show that a  membrane trafficking factor, GFS9, has a role in flavonoid accumulation in the  vacuole. We screened a library of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with defects in  vesicle trafficking, and isolated the gfs9 mutant with abnormal pale tan-colored  seeds caused by low flavonoid accumulation levels. gfs9 is allelic to the  unidentified transparent testa mutant tt9. The responsible gene for these  phenotypes encodes a previously uncharacterized protein containing a region that  is conserved among eukaryotes. GFS9 is a peripheral membrane protein localized at  the Golgi apparatus. GFS9 deficiency causes several membrane trafficking defects,  including the mis-sorting of vacuolar proteins, vacuole fragmentation, the  aggregation of enlarged vesicles, and the proliferation of autophagosome-like  structures. These results suggest that GFS9 is required for vacuolar development  through membrane fusion at vacuoles. Our findings introduce a concept that plants  use GFS9-mediated membrane trafficking machinery for delivery of not only  proteins but also phytochemicals, such as flavonoids, to vacuoles.', '2014 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12637', 'Hara-Nishimura']
