<i>Erigeron breviscapus</i> is a Compositae plant, and its rich flavonoids have shown strong preventative and curative effects in the treatment of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. <i>bHLH</i> genes play a crucial role in plant growth and development. There are 116 <i>EbbHLH</i> genes in <i>E. breviscapus</i>, and each gene has been named based on its chromosome location. Our phylogenetic analysis divided these genes into 18 subfamilies. To further investigate its function, <i>EbbHLH80</i> was isolated from <i>E. breviscapus</i> leaves. Next, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of tobacco leaves were performed. Among 421 differentially accumulated compounds, 98 flavonoids were identified. In addition, differentially expressed genes were identified using RNA-seq, and further analysis suggested that <i>EbbHLH80</i>-OE could not only regulate the expression of some structural genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway to achieve flavonoid accumulation but also be involved in the regulation of a series of downstream pathways, such as stress response, ABA and ethylene signal transduction, to affect plant growth and development. The results of our analysis provide new insights into the function of <i>EbbHLH80</i> and lay the foundation for future functional studies on <i>E. breviscapus</i>.
