Insect herbivory challenges plant survival, and coordination of the interactions between growth, herbivore resistance/tolerance is a key problem faced by plants. Based on field experiments into resistance to the Asian corn borer (ACB, Ostrinia furnacalis), we selected 10 inbred maize lines, of which five were resistant and five were susceptible to ACB. We conducted ACB larval bioassays, analysed defensive chemicals, phytohormones, and relative gene expression using RNA-seq and qPCR as well as agronomic traits, and found resistant lines had weaker inducibility, but were more resistant after ACB attack than susceptible lines. Resistance was related to high levels of major benzoxazinoids, but was not related to induced levels of JA or JA-Ile. Following combination analyses of transcriptome, metabolome and larval performance data, we discovered three benzoxazinoids biosynthesis-related transcription factors, NAC60, WRKY1 and WRKY46. Protoplast transformation analysis suggested that these may regulate maize defence-growth trade-offs by increasing levels of benzoxazinoids, JA and SA but decreasing IAA. Moreover, the resistance/tolerance-growth trade-offs were not observed in the 10 lines, and genotype-specific metabolic and genetic features probably eliminated the trade-offs. This study highlights the possibility of breeding maize varieties simultaneously with improved defences and higher yield under complex field conditions.
