['11427685', 'Lipoic acid is an essential coenzyme required for activity of several key enzyme  complexes, such as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, in the central metabolism.  In these complexes, lipoic acid must be covalently attached to one of the  component proteins for it to have biological activity. We report the cloning and  characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana LIP2 cDNA for lipoyltransferase that  catalyzes the transfer of the lipoyl group from lipoyl-acyl carrier protein to  lipoate-dependent enzymes. This cDNA was shown to code for lipoyltransferase by  its ability to complement an Escherichia coli lipB null mutant lacking  lipoyltransferase activity. The expressed enzyme in the E. coli mutant  efficiently complemented the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, but less  efficiently than that of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Comparison of the  deduced amino acid sequence of LIP2 with those of E. coli and yeast  lipoyltransferases showed a marked sequence similarity and the presence of a  leader sequence presumably required for import into mitochondria. Southern and  northern hybridization analyses suggest that LIP2 is a single-copy gene and is  expressed as an mRNA of 860 nt in leaves. Western blot analysis with an antibody  against lipoyltransferase demonstrated that a 29 kDa form of lipoyltransferase is  located in the mitochondrial compartment of A. thaliana.', '2001 Jun', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pce081', 'Wada']
