Alternative splicing (AS) occurs extensively in eukaryotes as an essential mechanism for regulating transcriptome complexity and diversity, but the AS landscape regulating potassium (K) use efficiency in plants is unclear. In this study, we performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of roots and shoots from allopolyploid <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> under K<sup>+</sup> deficiency. Preliminary physiological analysis showed that root system architecture was dramatically changed due to potassium deficiency and that IAA content was significantly reduced in root and shoot. AS analysis showed that a total of 28,179 genes exhibited 54,457 AS events, and 1,510 and 1,732 differentially alternatively spliced (DAS) events were identified in shoots and roots under low K<sup>+</sup> stress. Nevertheless, only 120 DAS events occurred in both shoots and roots, implying that most DAS events were tissue-specific. Both in shoot and the root, the proportion of DAS genes in differentially expressed (DE) genes equaled that in non-DE genes, which indicated that AS might play a unique regulatory role in response to low potassium. Gene ontology analysis further indicated that transcription regulation and AS modulation worked independently in response to low K<sup>+</sup> stress in tobacco, as their target biological processes were different. Totally 45 DAS transcription factors (TFs) were found, which were involved in 18 TF families. Five Auxin response factor (ARF) TFs were significantly DAS in root, suggesting that response to auxin was probably subject to AS regulation in the tobacco root. Our study shows that AS variation occurs extensively and has a particular regulatory mechanism under K<sup>+</sup> deficiency in tobacco. The study also links changes in root system architecture with the changes in AS of ARF TFs, which implied the functional significance of these AS events for root growth and architecture.
