The lower regeneration rate of wheat calli is the main factor restricting the development of transgenic wheat plants. Therefore, improving the regeneration rate of wheat callus is a precondition for developing genetic engineering-based wheat breeding approaches. In the present study, we explored the molecular mechanism of wheat regeneration and aimed to establish an efficient system for transgenic wheat. We isolated and identified a regeneration-related gene, <i>TaTCP-1</i> (KC808517), from wheat cultivar Lunxuan 987. Sequence analysis revealed that the ORF of <i>TaTCP-1</i> was 1623bp long encoding 540 amino acids. The <i>TaTCP-1</i> gene was expressed in various wheat tissues. Further, the level of <i>TaTCP-1</i> expression was higher in calli and increased gradually with increasing callus induction time, reaching a peak on the 11th day after induction. Moreover, the expression level of <i>TaTCP-1</i> was higher in embryogenic calli than in non-embryonic calli. The TaTCP-1 protein was localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane. The callus regeneration rate of wheat plants transformed with TaTCP-1-RNAi reduced by 85.09%. In contrast, it increased by 14.43% in plants overexpressing <i>TaTCP-1</i>. In conclusion, our results showed that <i>TaTCP-1</i> played a vital role in promoting wheat regeneration, and regulated the somatic embryogenesis of wheat. These results may have implications in the genetic engineering of wheat for improved wheat production.
