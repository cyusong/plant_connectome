Leaf dark respiration (R<sub>dark</sub> ) represents an important component controlling the carbon balance in tropical forests. Here, we test how nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) affect R<sub>dark</sub> and its relationship with photosynthesis using three widely separated tropical forests which differ in soil fertility. R<sub>dark</sub> was measured on 431 rainforest canopy trees, from 182 species, in French Guiana, Peru and Australia. The variation in R<sub>dark</sub> was examined in relation to leaf N and P content, leaf structure and maximum photosynthetic rates at ambient and saturating atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. We found that the site with the lowest fertility (French Guiana) exhibited greater rates of R<sub>dark</sub> per unit leaf N, P and photosynthesis. The data from Australia, for which there were no phylogenetic overlaps with the samples from the South American sites, yielded the most distinct relationships of R<sub>dark</sub> with the measured leaf traits. Our data indicate that no single universal scaling relationship accounts for variation in R<sub>dark</sub> across this large biogeographical space. Variability between sites in the absolute rates of R<sub>dark</sub> and the R<sub>dark</sub>  : photosynthesis ratio were driven by variations in N- and P-use efficiency, which were related to both taxonomic and environmental variability.
