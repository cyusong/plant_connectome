Phosphomannomutase (PMM; EC 5.4.2.8) catalyzes the interconversion of mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate in the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway for the biosynthesis of l-ascorbic acid (AsA). We have cloned the PMM cDNA from acerola (Malpighia glabra), a plant containing an enormous amount of AsA. The AsA contents correlate with the PMM gene expression of the ripening fruits and leaves. The PMM activities in the leaves of acerola, tomato and Arabidopsis correlate with their respective AsA contents. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the acerola PMM gene showed about a 2-fold increase in AsA contents compared with the wild type, with a corresponding correlation with the PMM transcript levels and activities.
