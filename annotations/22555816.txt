In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), nicotine and related pyridine alkaloids are produced in the root, and then transported to the aerial parts where these toxic chemicals function as part of chemical defense against insect herbivory. Although a few tobacco transporters have been recently reported to take up nicotine into the vacuole from the cytoplasm or into the cytoplasm from the apoplast, it is not known how the long-range translocation of tobacco alkaloids between organs is controlled. Nicotiana langsdorffii and N. alata are closely related species of diploid Nicotiana section Alatae, but the latter does not accumulate tobacco alkaloids in the leaf. We show here that N. alata does synthesize alkaloids in the root, but lacks the capacity to mobilize the root-borne alkaloids to the aerial parts. Interspecific grafting experiments between N. alata and N. langsdorffii indicate that roots of N. alata are unable to translocate alkaloids to their shoot system. Interestingly, genetic studies involving interspecific hybrids between N. alata and N. langsdorffii and their self-crossed or back-crossed progeny showed that the non-translocation phenotype is dominant over the translocation phenotype. These results indicate that a mechanism to retain tobacco alkaloids within the root organ has evolved in N. alata, which may represent an interesting strategy to control the distribution of secondary products within a whole plant.
