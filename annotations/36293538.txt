Tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), a sub-family of aquaporins (AQPs), are known to play important roles in plant abiotic stress responses. However, evidence for the promoters of TIPs involvement in abiotic stress processes remains scarce. In this study, the promoter of the vegetable soybean <i>GmTIP1;6</i> gene, which had the highest similarity to TIP1-type AQPs from other plants, was cloned. Expression pattern analyses indicated that the <i>GmTIP1;6</i> gene was dramatically induced by drought, salt, abscisic acid (ABA), and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) stimuli. Promoter analyses revealed that the <i>GmTIP1;6</i> promoter contained drought, ABA, and MeJA <i>cis</i>-acting elements. Histochemical staining of the <i>GmTIP1;6</i> promoter in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> corroborated that it was strongly expressed in the vascular bundles of leaves, stems, and roots. Beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity assays showed that the activities of the <i>GmTIP1;6</i> promoter were enhanced by different concentrations of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000), NaCl, ABA, and MEJA treatments. Integrating these results revealed that the <i>GmTIP1;6</i> promoter could be applied for improving the tolerance to abiotic stresses of the transgenic plants by promoting the expression of vegetable soybean <i>AQPs</i>.
