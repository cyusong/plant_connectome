Hexaploid wheat is a major food crop and is sensitive to heat stress. It is necessary to discover genes related to thermotolerance in wheat. Fes1s is a class of nucleotide exchange factor of heat shock protein 70s, proven to be participated in heat response in human, yeast, and Arabidopsis. However, little is known about Fes1s in hexaploid wheat. In this study, we identified nine <i>Fes1s</i> in hexaploid wheat (<i>TaFes1s</i>) and found that they present as three triads. A phylogenetic relationship analysis revealed that these <i>Fes1s</i> grouped into <i>Fes1A</i>, <i>Fes1B</i> and <i>Fes1C</i> subclades, and <i>Fes1As</i> and <i>Fes1Bs</i> were divergent in monocots, but possibly not in dicots. The sequences, gene structures and protein motifs of <i>TaFes1s</i> homoeologues within a triad were highly conserved. Through cis-elements analysis including heat shock elements, and miRNA targets prediction, we found that regulation of three <i>TaFes1s</i> homoeologues may be different, while the expression patterns of three homoeologues were similar. The expression levels of <i>TaFes1As</i> were higher than those of <i>TaFes1Bs</i> and <i>TaFes1Cs</i>, and based on these expressions, <i>TaFes1As</i> were chosen for functional characterization. Intriguingly, neither <i>TaFes1A-5A</i> nor <i>TaFes1A-5D</i> could not rescue the thermotolerance defect of Arabidopsis <i>fes1a</i> mutants at seedling stage, but in the transgenic plants seed germination was accelerated under normal and heat stress condition. The functional characterization indicated that roles of <i>Fes1As</i> would be different in Arabidopsis and hexaploid wheat, and function retention of <i>TaFes1As</i> may occur during wheat evolution. In conclusion, our study comprehensively characterized the distribution and expression of <i>Fes1s</i> in hexaploid wheat and found that two <i>TaFes1As</i> could accelerate seed germination under normal and heat stress condition.
