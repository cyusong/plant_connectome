Thiol reduction proteins are key regulators of the redox state of the cell, managing development and stress response programs. In plants, thiol reduction proteins, namely thioredoxin (TRX), glutaredoxin (GRX), and their respective reducers glutathione reductase (GR) and thioredoxin reductase (TR), are organized in complex multigene families. In order to decipher the function of the different proteins, it is necessary to have a clear picture of their respective expression profiles. By collecting information from gene expression databases, we have performed a comprehensive in silico study of the expression of all members of different classes of thiol reduction genes (TRX, GRX) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Tissue expression profiles and response to many biotic and abiotic stress conditions have been studied systematically. Altogether, the significance of our data is discussed with respect to published biochemical and genetic studies.
