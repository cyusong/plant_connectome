Plant microRNAs have been implicated in various abiotic stress responses. We identified several conserved microRNAs that showed differential expression in Medicago truncatula plants subjected to water deficit: miR169 is down-regulated only in the roots and miR398a/b and miR408 are strongly up-regulated in both shoots and roots. Down-regulation of miR169 in the roots did not correlate with accumulation of its target MtHAP2-1 transcripts, suggesting that its regulation may not occur at the mRNA level or may depend on other regulatory mechanisms, which do not involve this miRNA, in water-deficit conditions. The up-regulation of miR398a/b and miR408 and the clear down-regulation of their respective target genes, which encode the copper proteins COX5b (subunit 5b of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase) and plantacyanin, highlight the involvement of these miRNAs in response to water deprivation in M. truncatula. Also, miR398 up-regulation is inversely correlated with the down-regulation of copper superoxide dismutase, CSD1, during water deficit. The regulation of genes encoding copper proteins by miR398a/b and miR408 suggests a link between copper homeostasis and M. truncatula adaptation to progressive water deficit.
