Tropospheric ozone concentrations are increasing in many Asian countries and are expected to reach levels that adversely affect crop production. Developing ozone-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties is therefore essential to prevent yield losses in the future. The aims of this study were to assess genotypic variation for ozone tolerance in rice, to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring tolerance, and to relate QTLs to physiological tolerance mechanisms. The response of 23 varieties to elevated ozone (120 nl l(-1)) was assessed based on leaf bronzing and dry weight loss. The traditional variety 'Kasalath' was highly tolerant, whereas the modern variety 'Nipponbare' showed significant dry weight reductions. Using the Nipponbare/Kasalath/Nipponbare mapping population, six QTLs associated with tolerance to elevated ozone were identified, of which three were subsequently confirmed in Nipponbare/Kasalath substitution lines (SLs). Two QTLs associated with leaf bronzing were located on chromosomes three and nine. Kasalath alleles on chromosome three increased bronzing, while alleles on chromosome nine reduced bronzing. SLs carrying these contrasting QTLs differed significantly in leaf ascorbic acid (AsA) content when exposed to ozone, suggesting AsA as a principal antioxidant counteracting ozone-induced oxidative damage. A further confirmed QTL related to dry weight was located on chromosome eight, where the Kasalath allele increased relative dry weight. A SL carrying this QTL exhibited a less reduced net photosynthetic rate under ozone exposure compared with its recurrent parent Nipponbare. Although the effect of these QTLs on crop yield has not yet been established, their identification could be an important first step in developing ozone-tolerant rice varieties.
