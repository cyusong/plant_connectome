Seed oil bodies (OBs) are intracellular particles that store lipids. In maize embryos, the oil bodies are accumulated mainly in the scutellum. Oil bodies were purified from the scutellum of germinating maize seeds and the associated proteins were extracted and subjected to 2-DE analysis followed by LC-MS/MS for protein identification. In addition to the previously known oil body proteins oleosin, caleosin and steroleosin, new proteins were identified.
