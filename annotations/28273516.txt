Future long-term spaceflight missions rely on bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS) in order to provide the required resources for crew survival. Higher plants provide an essential part since they supply food and oxygen and recycle carbon dioxide. There are indications that under space conditions plants might be inefficient regarding the uptake, transport and distribution of nutrients, which in turn affects growth and metabolism. Therefore, Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) seeds were germinated and grown for five days under fast clinorotation (2-D clinostat, 60rpm) in order to simulate microgravity. Concentrations of ten different nutrients (potassium, sulfur, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, magnesium, manganese, iron, zinc, and boron) in shoots of plants grown under reduced and normal (1g) gravity conditions were compared. A protocol was developed for the determination of different nutrients by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES), flame emission spectrometry and spectrophotometry. The concentrations of boron and sulfur were significantly decreased in clinorotated shoots, while the concentration of sodium was elevated, suggesting that altered gravity conditions differentially affected nutrient uptake. Possible mechanisms for such effects include reduced transpiration, altered expression of channels or transporters and direct effects on nutrient assimilation. The observed nutrient imbalances might have a negative impact on plant growth and nutritional quality during prolonged space missions.
