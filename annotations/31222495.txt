An edible plant was tested as a host for the production of secretory monoclonal IgA against Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1). The lettuce-derived IgA completely protected Vero cells from Stx1. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is thought to control mucosal infections and thus it may be applicable to oral passive immunotherapy. Edible plants are candidate hosts for producing oral formulations with SIgA against pathogenic agents. We previously established a recombinant IgA specific for the B subunit of Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1B) consisting of the Fab fragment of Stx1B-specific monoclonal IgG and the Fc region of IgA (hyIgA). Here, we developed transgenic lettuce (Lactuca sativa) that produces hyIgA in a secretory form (S-hyIgA). An Arabidopsis-derived light-harvesting complex II (LHCB) promoter was used for the expression of all four transgenes (hyIgA heavy, light and j chains, and secretory component). Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was carried out to introduce genes into lettuce leaf discs by means of a single vector harboring all four transgenes. Consistent with the tissue specificity of the LHCB promoter, the expression of hyIgA transgenes was observed in leaf and stem tissues, which contain chloroplasts, at the mRNA and protein levels. The leaves produced hyIgA in a more than tenfold higher yield as compared with stems. The lettuce-derived S-hyIgA was found to bind to Stx1B in a dose-dependent manner by means of ELISA. A leaf extract of the transgenic lettuce completely neutralized the cytotoxicity of Stx1 against Vero cells, which are highly susceptible to Stx1. In conclusion, we established a transgenic lettuce producing a secretory form of hyIgA that can bind bacterial toxin. The results indicate that edible practical plants containing S-hyIgA will provide a possible means for immunotherapy for food poisoning.
