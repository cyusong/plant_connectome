['9670562', 'The disease resistance genes RPS2 of Arabidopsis and N of tobacco, among other  recently cloned resistance genes, share several conserved sequences. Degenerate  oligonucleotide primers, based on conserved sequences in the nucleotide binding  site (NBS) and a weak hydrophobic domain of RPS2 and N, were used to amplify  homologous sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana. Amplification products were  obtained that were similar in sequence to the disease resistance genes RPS2,  RPM1, N and L6. The Arabidopsis CIC-YAC library was used to identify the position  of the disease resistance homologs on the Arabidopsis genome. Their map positions  could be correlated with the disease resistance loci RPS5, RAC1, RPP9, CAR1,  RPP7, RPW2, RPP1, RPP10, RPP14, RPP5, RPP4, RPS2, RPW6, HRT, RPS4, RPP8, RPP21,  RPP22, RPP23, RPP24 and TTR1. This method was therefore not only successful in  the identification of sequences located within gene clusters that are involved in  disease resistance, but could also contribute to the cloning of disease  resistance genes from Arabidopsis.', '1998 May', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1998.00138.x', 'Beynon']
