['23040517', 'Diverse RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have increasingly been determined to perform  crucial roles in posttranscriptional regulation of RNA metabolism during plant  response to abscisic acid (ABA) or abiotic stresses, but the functional roles of  a variety of ABA-responsive RBPs in ABA and stress response remain poorly  understood. Here, we characterized an ABA-regulated putative RBP (At3g54770) in  Arabidopsis thaliana, designated ARP1, for its role in response to ABA or abiotic  stresses. The expression of ARP1 was markedly downregulated by ABA, and ARP1 is  localized to the nucleus. Interestingly, both overexpression and knockout of ARP1  resulted in delayed seed germination under ABA, high salt, or dehydration stress  conditions. The identical phenotypes of ARP1-overexpressing plants and the arp1  null mutant indicate that a tight regulation of ARP1 transcript is required for  normal function. Transcript levels of several germination-responsive genes were  modulated by ARP1 under ABA. Taken together, the results of the present study  demonstrate that ARP1 affects ABA-regulated seed germination of Arabidopsis, and  indicate that the regulation of posttranscriptional RNA metabolism is critical in  plant response to ABA or abiotic stresses.', '2013 Jan 15', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2012.09.002', 'Kang']
