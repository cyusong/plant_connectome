['17586809', 'Two closely related Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), MPK3  and MPK6, are rapidly but transiently activated in plants exposed to ozone.  Although the contribution of these MAPKs to control of redox stress has been  examined extensively, it remains unclear whether the dual-specificity MKPs play  an essential role in the regulation of these processes. To explore this question,  specific knockdown of each of the five putative MKPs in Arabidopsis was  performed, and the ozone sensitivity phenotype of each MKP-suppressed line was  assessed. Silencing of only one previously uncharacterized MKP, designated  AtMKP2, rendered the plants hypersensitive to oxidative stress. AtMKP2-suppressed  plants displayed significantly prolonged MPK3 and MPK6 activation during ozone  treatment, and recombinant AtMKP2 was able to dephosphorylate both phospho-MPK3  and phospho-MPK6 in vitro, providing direct evidence that AtMKP2 may target these  oxidant-activated MAPKs. In addition, the in vitro phosphatase activity of AtMKP2  was enhanced by co-incubation with either recombinant MPK3 or MPK6. In  AtMKP2:YFP-expressing plants, the fusion protein was localized predominantly in  the nucleus, the same compartment into which ozone-activated MPK3 and MPK6 have  previously been shown to be translocated. Taken together, these data suggest that  AtMKP2, a novel MKP protein in Arabidopsis, acts upon MPK3 and -6, and serves as  a positive regulator of the cellular response to oxidant challenge.', '2007 Aug 24', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M701888200', 'Ellis']
