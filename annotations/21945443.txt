['21945443', 'The gene for a putative cation calcium exchanger (CCX) from Arabidopsis thaliana,  AtCCX5, was cloned and its function was analyzed in yeast. Green fluorescent  protein-tagged AtCCX5 expressed in yeast was localized in the plasma membrane and  nuclear periphery. The yeast transformants expressing AtCCX5 were created and  their growth in the presence of various cations (K(+), Na(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+),  Fe(2+), Cu(2+), Co(2+), Cd(2+), Mn(2+), Ba(2+), Ni(2+), Zn(2+), and Li(+)) were  analyzed. AtCCX5 expression was found to affect the response to K(+) and Na(+) in  yeast. The AtCCX5 transformant also showed a little better growth to Zn(2+). The  yeast mutant 9.3 expressing AtCCX5 restored growth of the mutant on medium with  low K(+) (0.5mM), and also suppressed its Na(+) sensitivity. Ion uptake  experiments showed that AtCCX5 mediated relatively high-affinity K(+) uptake and  was also involved in Na(+) transport in yeast. Taken together, these findings  suggest that the AtCCX5 is a novel transport protein involves in mediating  high-affinity K(+) uptake and Na(+) transport in yeast.', '2011 Oct 14', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.030', 'Liu']
