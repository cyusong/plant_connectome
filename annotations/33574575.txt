DNA replication stress poses a severe threat to genome stability and is a hallmark of cancer as well as a target for cancer therapy. It is well known that the evolutionarily conserved protein kinase WEE1 regulates replication stress responses by directly phosphorylating and inhibiting the major cell cycle driver CDKs in many organisms. Here, we report a novel WEE1 pathway. We found that Arabidopsis WEE1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBL17 that promotes the degradation of CDK inhibitors. The phosphorylated FBL17 is further polyubiquitinated and degraded, thereby leading to the accumulation of CDK inhibitors and the inhibition of CDKs. In strong support for this model, either loss of function of FBL17 or overexpression of CDK inhibitors suppresses the hypersensitivity of the wee1 mutant to replication stress. Intriguingly, human WEE1 also phosphorylates and destabilizes the FBL17 equivalent protein SKP2, indicating that this is a conserved mechanism. This study reveals that the WEE1-FBL17/SKP2-CKIs-CDKs axis is a molecular framework for replication stress responses, which may have clinical implications because the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 is currently in phase II clinical trial as an anticancer drug.
