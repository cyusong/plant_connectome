This review focuses on the essential role played by the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in revealing both the mechanism and the physiological consequences of state transitions. Two aspects are considered. The first is the role of the cytochrome b6f complex in regulating state transitions, in light of the recently obtained 3D structure. The second is the switch between linear and cyclic electron flow that follows state transitions in Chlamydomonas. Structural and dynamic elements that might be involved in such a switch, as well as its consequences on the energetic metabolism, are discussed.
