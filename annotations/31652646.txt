Exploring genetic methods to improve yield in grain crops such as rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is essential to help meet the needs of the increasing population. Here, we report that rice ONAC096 affects grain yield by regulating leaf senescence and panicle number. <i>ONAC096</i> expression increased rapidly in rice leaves upon the initiation of aging- and dark-induced senescence. Two independent T-DNA insertion mutants (<i>onac096-1</i> and <i>onac096-2</i>) with downregulated <i>ONAC096</i> expression retained their green leaf color during natural senescence in the field, thus extending their photosynthetic capacity. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR analysis showed that <i>ONAC096</i> upregulated genes controlling chlorophyll degradation and leaf senescence. Repressed <i>OsCKX2</i> (encoding cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase) expression in the <i>onac096</i> mutants led to a 15% increase in panicle number without affecting grain weight or fertility. <i>ONAC096</i> mediates abscisic acid (ABA)-induced leaf senescence by upregulating the ABA signaling genes <i>ABA INSENSITIVE5</i> and <i>ENHANCED EM LEVEL</i>. The <i>onac096</i> mutants showed a 16% increase in grain yield, highlighting the potential for using this gene to increase grain production.
