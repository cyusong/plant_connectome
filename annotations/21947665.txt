['21947665', 'Brassinosteroids (BRs) play a crucial role in plant growth and development and  DIMINUTO 1 (DIM1), a protein involved in BR biosynthesis, was previously  identified as a cell elongation factor in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through promoter  expression analysis, we showed that DIM1 was expressed in most of the tissue  types in seedlings and sectioning of the inflorescence stem revealed that DIM1  predominantly localizes to the xylem vessels and in the interfascicular cambium.  To investigate the role of DIM1 in cell wall formation, we generated  loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants. Disruption of the gene function  caused a dwarf phenotype with up to 38 and 23% reductions in total lignin and  cellulose, respectively. Metabolite analysis revealed a significant reduction in  the levels of fructose, glucose and sucrose in the loss-of-function mutant  compared to the wild type control. The loss-of-function mutant also had a lower  S/G lignin monomer ratio relative to wild type, but no changes were detected in  the gain-of-function mutant. Phloroglucinol and toluidine blue staining showed a  size reduction of the vascular apparatus with smaller and disintegrated xylem  vessels in the inflorescence stem of the loss-of-function mutant. Taken together,  these data indicate a role for DIM1 in secondary cell wall formation. Moreover,  this study demonstrated the potential role of BR hormones in modulating cell wall  structure and composition.', '2012 Mar', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-011-1519-4', 'Hannoufa']
