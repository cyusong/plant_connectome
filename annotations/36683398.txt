Flavonoids are important plant pigments and defense compounds; understanding the transcriptional regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis may enable engineering crops with improved nutrition and stress tolerance. Here, we characterize R2R3-MYB domain subgroup 7 transcription factor CaMYB39, which regulates flavonol biosynthesis primarily in chickpea trichomes. CaMYB39 overexpression in chickpea was accompanied by a change in flux availability for the phenylpropanoid pathway, particularly flavonol biosynthesis. Lines overexpressing CaMYB39 showed higher isoflavonoid levels, suggesting its role in regulating isoflavonoid pathway. CaMYB39 transactivates the transcription of early flavonoid biosynthetic genes (EBG). FLAVONOL SYNTHASE2, an EBG, encodes an enzyme with higher substrate specificity for dihydrokaempferol than other dihydroflavonols explaining the preferential accumulation of kaempferol derivatives as prominent flavonols in chickpea. Interestingly, CaMYB39 overexpression increased trichome density and enhanced the accumulation of diverse flavonol derivatives in trichome-rich tissues. Moreover, CaMYB39 overexpression reduced reactive oxygen species levels and induced defense gene expression which aids in partially blocking the penetration efficiency of the fungal pathogen, Ascochyta rabiei, resulting in lesser symptoms, thus establishing its role against deadly Ascochyta blight (AB) disease. Overall, our study reports an instance where R2R3-MYB-SG7 member, CaMYB39, besides regulating flavonol biosynthesis, modulates diverse pathways like general phenylpropanoid, isoflavonoid, trichome density, and defense against necrotrophic fungal infection in chickpea.
