The <i>CAPRICE</i> (<i>CPC</i>) gene encodes a R3-type MYB transcription factor that promotes differentiation of root hair cells in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Here, we have compared the functions of five <i>CPC</i>-homologous genes for epidermal cell differentiation using <i>CPC</i> promoter-driven transgenic plants. Our results show that TRIPTYCHON (TRY) and ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC2 (ETC2) were less effective in root hair cell differentiation and were unstable in root epidermal cells when compared with CPC, ETC1 or CPC LIKE MYB3 (CPL3). The deletion of the extended C-terminal domain of TRY and ETC2 enhanced protein stability and conferred the ability to induce root hair cell differentiation on them. Treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, also led to the accumulation of TRY, indicating that TRY proteolysis is mediated by the proteasome-dependent pathway. Our results indicate that the CPC family includes relatively stable (CPC, ETC1 and CPL3) and unstable (TRY and ETC2) proteins that might be degraded by the proteasome. Our findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of CPC family proteins that mediate root hair cell differentiation and should be useful in understanding epidermal development.
