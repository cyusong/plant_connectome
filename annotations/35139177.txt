An optimal size of post-embryonic root apical meristem (RAM) is achieved by a balance between cell division and differentiation. Despite extensive research, molecular mechanisms underlying the coordination of cell division and differentiation are still fragmentary. Here, we report that ORESARA 15 (ORE15), an Arabidopsis PLANT A/T-RICH SEQUENCE-AND ZINC-BINDING PROTEIN (PLATZ) transcription factor preferentially expressed in the RAM, determines RAM size. Primary root length, RAM size, cell division rate, and stem cell niche activity were reduced in an ore15 loss-of-function mutant but enhanced in an activation-tagged line overexpressing ORE15, compared with wild type. ORE15 forms mutually positive and negative feedback loops with auxin and cytokinin signalling, respectively. Collectively, our findings imply that ORE15 controls RAM size by mediating the antagonistic interaction between auxin and cytokinin signalling-related pathways.
