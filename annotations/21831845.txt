The EID1-like protein 3 (EDL3) shows high similarity to EID1 (Empfindlicher im dunkelroten Licht 1), an F-box protein that functions as a negative regulator in the signalling cascade downstream of the phytochrome A photoreceptor in Arabidopsis thaliana. Analyses revealed a strong and rapid induction of EDL3 gene expression under osmotic stress, high salinity, and upon abscisic acid (ABA) application. Therefore, it was speculated that EDL3 is involved in the regulation of responses controlled by this plant hormone, which not only regulates many aspects of plant development but also integrates responses towards temperature, drought, osmotic, and salt stresses. Physiological data obtained with over-expresser lines and a conditional knock-down mutant demonstrated that EDL3 functions as a positive regulator in ABA-dependent signalling cascades that control seed germination, root growth, greening of etiolated seedlings, and transition to flowering. Results further demonstrate that EDL3 regulates anthocyanin accumulation under drought stress. The observed effects on physiological responses fit to tissue-specific expression patterns obtained with EDL3-promoter:GUS lines. Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation assays and yeast two-hybrid analyses showed that EDL3 carries a functional F-box domain. Thus, the protein is presumed to act as a component of a ubiquitin ligase complex that specifically directs negatively acting factors in ABA signalling to degradation via the proteasome.
