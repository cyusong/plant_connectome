['22422982', "Strigolactones, phytohormones with diverse signaling activities, have a common  structure consisting of two lactones connected by an enol-ether bridge.  Strigolactones derive from carotenoids via a pathway involving the carotenoid  cleavage dioxygenases 7 and 8 (CCD7 and CCD8) and the iron-binding protein D27.  We show that D27 is a beta-carotene isomerase that converts all-trans-beta-carotene  into 9-cis-beta-carotene, which is cleaved by CCD7 into a 9-cis-configured aldehyde.  CCD8 incorporates three oxygens into 9-cis-beta-apo-10'-carotenal and performs  molecular rearrangement, linking carotenoids with strigolactones and producing  carlactone, a compound with strigolactone-like biological activities. Knowledge  of the structure of carlactone will be crucial for understanding the biology of  strigolactones and may have applications in combating parasitic weeds.", '2012 Mar 16', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1218094', 'Al-Babili']
