A targeting method to insert genes at a previously characterized genetic locus to make plant transformation and transgene expression predictable is highly desirable for plant biotechnology. We report the successful targeting of transgenes to predefined soybean (Glycine max) genome sites using the yeast FLP-FRT recombination system. First, a target DNA containing a pair of incompatible FRT sites flanking a selection gene was introduced in soybean by standard biolistic transformation. Transgenic events containing a single copy of the target were retransformed with a donor DNA, which contained the same pair of FRT sites flanking a different selection gene, and a FLP expression DNA. Precise DNA cassette exchange was achieved between the target and donor DNA via recombinase-mediated cassette exchange, so that the donor DNA was introduced at the locus previously occupied by the target DNA. The introduced donor genes expressed normally and segregated according to Mendelian laws.

FLP-FRT: !inserts! genes 
target DNA: !flanks! selection gene 
donor DNA: !flanks! different selection gene 
FLP expression DNA: !mediates! cassette exchange 
donor genes: !expresses normally! and !segregates! according to Mendelian laws
