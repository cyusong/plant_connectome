Seed size is a key agronomic trait that greatly determines plant yield. Elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying seed size regulation is also an important question in developmental biology. Here, we show that the KIX-PPD-MYC-GIF1 pathway plays a crucial role in seed size control in Arabidopsis thaliana. Disruption of KIX8/9 and PPD1/2 causes large seeds due to increased cell proliferation and cell elongation in the integuments. KIX8/9 and PPD1/2 interact with transcription factors MYC3/4 to form the KIX-PPD-MYC complex in Arabidopsis. The KIX-PPD-MYC complex associates with the typical G-box sequence in the promoter of GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (GIF1), which promotes seed growth, and represses its expression. Genetic analyses support that KIX8/9, PPD1/2, MYC3/4, and GIF1 function in a common pathway to control seed size. Thus, our results reveal a genetic and molecular mechanism by which the transcription factors MYC3/4 recruit KIX8/9 and PPD1/2 to the promoter of GIF1 and repress its expression, thereby determining seed size in Arabidopsis.
