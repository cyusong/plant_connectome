A glutaredoxin of the fern Pteris vittata PvGRX5 was previously implicated in arsenic tolerance. Because of possible involvements of glutaredoxins in metabolic adaptations to high temperature stress, transgenic Arabidopsis lines constitutively expressing PvGRX5 were evaluated for thermotolerance. Homozygous lines expressing PvGRX5 exhibited significantly greater tolerance to high temperature stress than the vector control and wild-type, based upon growth during stress and during recovery from stress, and this was related to leaf glutaredoxin specific activities. Measurements of tissue ion leakage, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and protein carbonyl content showed that PvGRX5-expressors were significantly (P < 0.05) less affected by the high temperature treatment compared to wild-type and vector control lines for damage to membranes and proteins. Immunoblots indicated that specific protein bands, carbonylated during the stress treatment in the control lines, were protected in PvGRX5-expressors, thus implicating PvGRX5 in heat tolerance, likely mediated through cellular protection against oxidative stress.
