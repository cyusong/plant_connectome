Seed coat color is a typical evolutionary trait. Identification of the genetic loci that control seed coat color during the domestication of wild soybean could clarify the genetic variations between cultivated and wild soybean. We used 276 F<sub>10</sub> recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross between a cultivated soybean (JY47) and a wild soybean (ZYD00321) as the materials to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seed coat color. We constructed a high-density genetic map using re-sequencing technology. The average distance between adjacent markers was 0.31 cM on this map, comprising 9,083 bin markers. We identified two stable QTLs (<i>qSC08</i> and <i>qSC11</i>) for seed coat color using this map, which, respectively, explained 21.933 and 26.934% of the phenotypic variation. Two candidate genes (<i>CHS3C</i> and <i>CHS4A</i>) in <i>qSC08</i> were identified according to the parental re-sequencing data and gene function annotations. Five genes (<i>LOC100786658</i>, <i>LOC100801691</i>, <i>LOC100806824</i>, <i>LOC100795475</i>, and <i>LOC100787559</i>) were predicted in the novel QTL <i>qSC11</i>, which, according to gene function annotations, might control seed coat color. This result could facilitate the identification of beneficial genes from wild soybean and provide useful information to clarify the genetic variations for seed coat color in cultivated and wild soybean.
