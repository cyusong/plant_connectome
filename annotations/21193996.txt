The transcriptional co-activator ADA2b is a component of GCN5-containing complexes in eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, ada2b mutants result in pleiotropic developmental defects and altered responses to low-temperature stress. SGF29 has recently been identified as another component of GCN5-containing complexes. In the Arabidopsis genome there are two orthologs of yeast SGF29, designated as SGF29a and SGF29b. We hypothesized that, in Arabidopsis, one or both SGF29 proteins may work in concert with ADA2b to regulate genes in response to abiotic stress, and we set out to explore the role of SGF29a and ADA2b in salt stress responses. In root growth and seed germination assays, sgf29a-1 mutants were more resistant to salt stress than their wild-type counterparts, whereas ada2b-1 mutant was hypersensitive. The sgf29a;ada2b double mutant displayed similar phenotypes to ada2b-1 mutant with reduced salt sensitivity. The expression of several abiotic stress-responsive genes was reduced in ada2b-1 mutants after 3 h of salt stress in comparison with sgf29a-1 and wild-type plants. In the sgf29a-1;ada2b-1 double mutant, the salt-induced gene expression was affected similarly to ada2b-1. These results suggest that under salt stress the function of SGF29a was masked by ADA2b and perhaps SGF29a could play an auxiliary role to ADA2b action. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, reduced levels of histone H3 and H4 acetylation in the promoter and coding region of COR6.6, RAB18, and RD29b genes were observed in ada2b-1 mutants relative to wild-type plants. In conclusion, ADA2b positively regulates salt-induced gene expression by maintaining the locus-specific acetylation of histones H4 and H3.
