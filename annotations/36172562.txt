Plants rely on root systems for nutrient uptake from soils. Marker-assisted selection helps breeders to select desirable root traits for effective nutrient uptake. Here, 12 root and biomass traits were investigated at the seedling stage under low nitrogen (LN), low phosphorus (LP), and low potassium (LK) conditions, respectively, in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, which was generated from <i>Brassica napus</i> L. Zhongshuang11 and 4D122 with significant differences in root traits and nutrient efficiency. Significant differences for all the investigated traits were observed among RILs, with high heritabilities (0.43-0.74) and high correlations between the different treatments. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping identified 57, 27, and 36 loci, explaining 4.1-10.9, 4.6-10.8, and 4.9-17.4% phenotypic variances under LN, LP, and LK, respectively. Through QTL-meta analysis, these loci were integrated into 18 significant QTL clusters. Four major QTL clusters involved 25 QTLs that could be repeatedly detected and explained more than 10% phenotypic variances, including two NPK-common and two specific QTL clusters (K and NK-specific), indicating their critical role in cooperative nutrients uptake of N, P, and K. Moreover, 264 genes within the four major QTL clusters having high expressions in roots and SNP/InDel variations between two parents were identified as potential candidate genes. Thirty-eight of them have been reported to be associated with root growth and development and/or nutrient stress tolerance. These key loci and candidate genes lay the foundation for deeper dissection of the NPK starvation response mechanisms in <i>B. napus</i>.
