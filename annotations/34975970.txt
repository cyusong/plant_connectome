Trichomes are unicellular or multicellular epidermal structures that play a defensive role against environmental stresses. Although unicellular trichomes have been extensively studied as a mechanistic model, the genes involved in multicellular trichome formation are not well understood. In this study, we first classified the trichome morphology structures in <i>Capsicum</i> species using 280 diverse peppers. We cloned a key gene (<i>Hairiness</i>) on chromosome 10, which mainly controlled the formation of multicellular non-glandular trichomes (types II, III, and V). <i>Hairiness</i> encodes a Cys2-His2 zinc-finger protein, and virus-induced gene silencing of the gene resulted in a hairless phenotype. Differential expression of <i>Hairiness</i> between the hairiness and hairless lines was due to variations in promoter sequences. Transgenic experiments verified the hypothesis that the promoter of <i>Hairiness</i> in the hairless line had extremely low activity causing a hairless phenotype. <i>Hair</i> controlled the formation of type I glandular trichomes in tomatoes, which was due to nucleotide differences. Taken together, our findings suggest that the regulation of multicellular trichome formation might have similar pathways, but the gene could perform slightly different functions in crops.
