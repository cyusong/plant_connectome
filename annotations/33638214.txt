Leaf angle is an important agronomic trait in cereals that helps determine plant yield by affecting planting density. However, the regulation mechanism of leaf angle remained elusive. Here, we show that OsbHLH98, a rice bHLH transcription factor, negatively regulates leaf angle. osbhlh98 mutant leaves formed a larger leaf angle, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing OsbHLH98 exhibited a slight reduction in leaf angle. We determined that the changes in leaf angle resulted from increased number and size of parenchyma cells on the adaxial side of the lamina joint in osbhlh98 mutants. Experiments using reporter constructs showed that OsbHLH98 is expressed on the adaxial side of lamina joints, consistent with its proposed function in regulating leaf angle. Furthermore, we established by chromatin immunoprecipitation and CUT&RUN that OsBUL1 is a direct downstream target of OsbHLH98. Transactivation assays and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis indicated that OsbHLH98 represses OsBUL1 transcription. Our results demonstrate that OsbHLH98 negatively regulates leaf angle by counteracting brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation via the repression of OsBUL1 transcription. The characterization of OsbHLH98 and its role in determining leaf angle will lay the foundation to develop the ideal plant architecture for adaptation to high planting density.
