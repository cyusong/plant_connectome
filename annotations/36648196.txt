Saccharum spontaneum and Saccharum officinarum contributed to the genetic background of modern sugarcane cultivars. Saccharum spontaneum has shown a higher net photosynthetic rate and lower soluble sugar than S. officinarum. Here, we analyzed 198 RNA-sequencing samples to investigate the molecular mechanisms for the divergences of photosynthesis and sugar accumulation between the two Saccharum species. We constructed gene co-expression networks based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) both for leaf developmental gradients and diurnal rhythm. Our results suggested that the divergence of sugar accumulation may be attributed to the enrichment of major carbohydrate metabolism and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Compared with S. officinarum, S. spontaneum DEGs showed a high enrichment of photosynthesis and contained more complex regulation of photosynthesis-related genes. Noticeably, S. spontaneum lacked gene interactions with sulfur assimilation stimulated by photorespiration. In S. spontaneum, core genes related to clock and photorespiration displayed a sensitive regulation by the diurnal rhythm and phase-shift. Small subunit of Rubisco (RBCS) displayed higher expression in the source tissues of S. spontaneum. Additionally, it was more sensitive under a diurnal rhythm, and had more complex gene networks than that in S. officinarum. This indicates that the differential regulation of RBCS Rubisco contributed to photosynthesis capacity divergence in both Saccharum species.
