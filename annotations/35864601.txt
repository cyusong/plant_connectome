In this study, we investigated Arabidopsis thaliana plants with altered levels of the enzyme JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (JAR1), which converts jasmonic acid (JA) to jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile). Analysis of a newly generated overexpression line (35S::JAR1) revealed that constitutively increased JA-Ile production in 35S::JAR1 alters plant development, resulting in stunted growth and delayed flowering. Under drought-stress conditions, 35S::JAR1 plants showed reduced wilting and recovered better from desiccation than the wild type. By contrast, jar1-11 plants with a strong reduction in JA-Ile content were hypersensitive to drought. RNA-sequencing analysis and hormonal profiling of plants under normal and drought conditions provided insights into the molecular reprogramming caused by the alteration in JA-Ile content. Especially 35S::JAR1 plants displayed changes in expression of developmental genes related to growth and flowering. Further transcriptional differences pertained to drought-related adaptive systems, including stomatal density and aperture, but also reactive oxygen species production and detoxification. Analysis of wild type and jar1-11 plants carrying the roGFP-Orp1 sensor support a role of JA-Ile in the alleviation of methyl viologen-induced H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production. Our data substantiate a role of JA-Ile in abiotic stress response and suggest that JAR1-mediated increase in JA-Ile content primes Arabidopsis towards improved drought stress tolerance.
