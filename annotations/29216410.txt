We investigated the invagination structure of a chloroplast that surrounds organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes within a thin layer of chloroplast stroma, which is called a chloroplast pocket. In this study, chloroplast pockets were observed in rice plants subjected to salinity stress but not under moderate growth condition. They included cytosol, transparent structure, lipid bodies, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. We constructed the three-dimensional architecture of chloroplast pockets by using serial images obtained by transmission electron microscopy and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy. Three types of chloroplast pockets were observed by transmission electron microscopy: Organelles were completely enclosed in a chloroplast pocket (enclosed type), a chloroplast pocket with a small gap in the middle part (gap type), and a chloroplast pocket with one side open (open type). Of the 70 pockets observed by serial imaging, 35 were enclosed type, and 21 and 14 were gap and open types, respectively. Mitochondria and peroxisomes were often in contact with the chloroplast pockets. Focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy revealed chloroplasts with a sheet structure partially surrounding peroxisomes. This fact suggests that chloroplasts might construct large sheet structures that would be related to the formation of chloroplast pockets.
