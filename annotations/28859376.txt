Zinc (Zn) is an essential nutrient for plants, with a crucial role as a cofactor for many enzymes. Approximately one-third of the global arable land area is Zn deficient, leading to reduced crop yield and quality. To improve crop tolerance to Zn deficiency, it is important to understand the mechanisms plants have adopted to tolerate suboptimal Zn supply. In this study, physiological and molecular aspects of traits related to Zn deficiency tolerance were examined in a panel of 19 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Accessions showed a larger variation for shoot biomass than for Zn concentration, indicating that they have different requirements for their minimal Zn concentration required for growth. Accessions with a higher tolerance to Zn deficiency showed an increased expression of the Zn deficiency-responsive genes ZIP4 and IRT3 in comparison with Zn deficiency-sensitive accessions. Changes in the shoot ionome, as a result of the Zn treatment of the plants, were used to build a multinomial logistic regression model able to distinguish plants regarding their Zn nutritional status. This set of biomarkers, reflecting the A. thaliana response to Zn deficiency and Zn deficiency tolerance, can be useful for future studies aiming to improve the performance and Zn status of crop plants grown under suboptimal Zn concentrations.
