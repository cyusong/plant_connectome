['22214659', 'Plants modify their growth and development to protect themselves from detrimental  conditions by triggering a variety of signaling pathways, including the  activation of the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway. Endoplasmic  reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) is an important aspect of  the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but only a few of the active ERAD components  have been reported in plants. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana  ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UBC32, a stress-induced functional ubiquitin  conjugation enzyme (E2) localized to the ER membrane, connects the ERAD process  and brassinosteroid (BR)-mediated growth promotion and salt stress tolerance. In  vivo data showed that UBC32 was a functional ERAD component that affected the  stability of a known ERAD substrate, the barley (Hordeum vulgare) powdery mildew  O (MLO) mutant MLO-12. UBC32 mutation caused the accumulation of bri1-5 and  bri1-9, the mutant forms of the BR receptor, BRI1, and these mutant forms  subsequently activated BR signal transduction. Further genetic and physiological  data supported the contention that UBC32 plays a role in the BR-mediated salt  stress response and that BR signaling is necessary for the plant to tolerate  salt. Our data indicates a possible mechanism by which an ERAD component  regulates the growth and stress response of plants.', '2012 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.093062', 'Xie']
