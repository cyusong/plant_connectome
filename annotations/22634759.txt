['22634759', 'Successful chlorophyll biosynthesis during initial light exposure is critical for  plant survival and growth, as excess accumulation of chlorophyll precursors in  darkness can cause photooxidative damage to cells. Therefore, efficient  mechanisms have evolved to precisely regulate chlorophyll biosynthesis in plants.  Here, we identify FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and FAR-RED IMPAIRED  RESPONSE1 (FAR1), two transposase-derived transcription factors, as positive  regulators of chlorophyll biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that null  mutations in FHY3 and FAR1 cause reduced protochlorophyllide (a precursor of  chlorophyll) levels in darkness and less photobleaching in the light. We find  that FHY3 directly binds to the promoter and activates expression of HEMB1, which  encodes 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase in the chlorophyll biosynthetic  pathway. We reveal that PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR1 physically interacts with  the DNA binding domain of FHY3, thereby partly repressing FHY3/FAR1-activated  HEMB1 expression. Strikingly, FHY3 expression is upregulated by white light. In  addition, our genetic data indicate that overexpression, severe reduction, or  lack of HEMB1 impairs plant growth and development. Together, our findings reveal  a crucial role of FHY3/FAR1 in regulating chlorophyll biosynthesis, thus  uncovering a new layer of regulation by which light promotes plant dark-light  transition in early seedling development.', '2012 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.097022', 'Lin']
