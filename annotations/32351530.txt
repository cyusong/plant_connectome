Autophagy is an efficient degradation system for maintaining cellular homeostasis when plants are under environmental stress. ATG9 is the only integral membrane protein within the core ATG machinery that provides a membrane source for autophagosome formation. In this study, we isolated an <i>ATG9</i> homologs gene in apple, <i>MdATG9</i>, from <i>Malus domestica</i>. The analysis of its sequence, subcellular localization, promoter cis-elements, and expression patterns revealed the potential function of <i>MdATG9</i> in response to abiotic stressors. Overexpression of <i>MdATG9</i> in apple callus conferred enhanced tolerance to nitrogen depletion stress. During the treatment, other important <i>MdATG</i>s were expressed at higher levels in transgenic callus than in the wild type. Furthermore, more free amino acids and increased sucrose levels were found in <i>MdATG9</i>-overexpression apple callus compared with the wild type in response to nitrogen starvation, and the expression levels of <i>MdNRT1.1</i>, <i>MdNRT2.5</i>, <i>MdNIA1</i>, and <i>MdNIA2</i> were all increased higher in transgenic lines. These data suggest that, as an important autophagy gene, <i>MdATG9</i> plays an important role in the maintenance of amino acids and sugars in response to nutrient starvation in apple.
