NH4 (+) is a major source of inorganic nitrogen for rice (Oryza sativa), and NH4 (+) is known to stimulate the uptake of phosphorus (P). However, it is unclear whether NH4 (+) can also stimulate P remobilization when rice is grown under P-deficient conditions. In this study, we use the two rice cultivars 'Nipponbare' and 'Kasalath' that differ in their cell wall P reutilization, to demonstrate that NH4 (+) positively regulates the pectin content and activity of pectin methylesterase in root cell walls under -P conditions, thereby remobilizing more P from the cell wall and increasing soluble P in roots and shoots. Interestingly, our results show that more NO (nitric oxide) was produced in the rice root when NH4 (+) was applied as the sole nitrogen source compared with the NO3 (-) The effect of NO on the reutilization of P from the cell walls was further demonstrated through the application of the NO donor SNP (sodium nitroprusside) and c-PTIO (NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4, 4, 5, 5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide). What's more, the P-transporter gene OsPT2 is up-regulated under NH4 (+) supplementation and is therefore involved in the stimulated P remobilization. In conclusion, our data provide novel (to our knowledge) insight into the regulatory mechanism by which NH4 (+) stimulates Pi reutilization in cell walls of rice.
