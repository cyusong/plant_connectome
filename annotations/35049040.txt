Sugars, the chemically bound form of energy, are formed by the absorption of photosynthetically active radiation and fixation in plants. During evolution, plants availed the sugar molecules as a resource, balancing molecule, and signaling molecule. The multifaceted role of sugar molecules in response to environmental stimuli makes it the central coordinator required for growth, survival, and continuity. During the course of evolution, the molecular networks have become complex to adapt or acclimate to the changing environment. Sugar molecules are sensed both intra and extracellularly by their specific sensors. The signal is transmitted by a signaling loop that involves various downstream signaling molecules, transcriptional factors and, most pertinent, the sensors TOR and SnRK1. In this review, the focus has been retained on the significance of the sugar sensors during signaling and induced modules to regulate plant growth, development, biotic and abiotic stress. It is interesting to visualize the sugar molecule as a signaling unit and not only a nutrient. Complete information on the downstream components of sugar signaling will open the gates for improving the qualitative and quantitative elements of crop plants.
