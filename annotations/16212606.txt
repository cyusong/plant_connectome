['16212606', 'By screening a T-DNA population of Arabidopsis mutants for alterations in  inflorescence stem vasculature, we have isolated a mutant with a dramatic  increase in vascular tissue development, characterized by a continuous ring of  xylem/phloem. This phenotype is the consequence of premature and numerous cambial  cell divisions in both the fascicular and interfascicular regions that result in  the loss of the alternate vascular bundle/fiber organization typically observed  in Arabidopsis stems. The mutant was therefore designated high cambial activity  (hca). The hca mutation also resulted in pleiotropic effects including stunting  and a delay in developmental events such as flowering and senescence. The  physiological characterization of hca seedlings in vitro revealed an altered  auxin and cytokinin response and, most strikingly, an enhanced sensitivity to  cytokinin. These results were substantiated by comparative microarray analysis  between hca and wild-type plants. The genetic analysis of hca indicated that the  mutant phenotype was not tagged by the T-DNA and that the hca mutation segregated  as a single recessive locus, mapping to the long arm of chromosome 4. We propose  that hca is involved in mechanisms controlling the arrangement of vascular  bundles throughout the plant by regulating the auxin-cytokinin sensitivity of  vascular cambial cells. Thus, the hca mutant is a useful model for examining the  genetic and hormonal control of cambial growth and differentiation.', '2005 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02526.x', 'Pichon']
