['33932060', 'The xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) are enzymes involved in  cell wall assembly and growth regulation, cleaving and re-joining hemicellulose  chains in the xyloglucan-cellulose network. Here, in a homologous system, we  compare the secretion patterns of XTH11, XTH33 and XTH29, three members of the  Arabidopsis thaliana XTH family, selected for the presence (XTH11 and XTH33) or  absence (XTH29) of a signal peptide, and the presence of a transmembrane domain  (XTH33). We show that XTH11 and XTH33 reached, respectively, the cell wall and  plasma membrane through a conventional protein secretion (CPS) pathway, whereas  XTH29 moves towards the apoplast following an unconventional protein secretion  (UPS) mediated by exocyst-positive organelles (EXPOs). All XTHs share a common  C-terminal functional domain (XET-C) that, for XTH29 and a restricted number of  other XTHs (27, 28 and 30), continues with an extraterminal region (ETR) of 45  amino acids. We suggest that this region is necessary for the correct cell wall  targeting of XTH29, as the ETR-truncated protein never reaches its final  destination and is not recruited by EXPOs. Furthermore, quantitative real-time  polymerase chain reaction analyses performed on 4-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings  exposed to drought and heat stress suggest a different involvement of the three  XTHs in cell wall remodeling under abiotic stress, evidencing stress-, organ- and  time-dependent variations in the expression levels. Significantly, XTH29,  codifying the only XTH that follows a UPS pathway, is highly upregulated with  respect to XTH11 and XTH33, which code for CPS-secreted proteins.', '2021 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.15301', 'ORCID:']
