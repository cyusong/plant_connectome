O-glycosylation is one of the most abundant and diverse types of post-translational modifications of proteins. O-glycans modulate the structure, stability, and function of proteins and serve generalized as well as highly specific roles in most biological processes. This ShapShot presents types of O-glycans found in different organisms and their principle biosynthetic pathways. To view this SnapShot, open or download the PDF.
