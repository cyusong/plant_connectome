['8938402', "The small genome size and excellent genetics of Arabidopsis, as well as the ease  with which it is transformed, make it a superb candidate for molecular genetic  studies of the purine biosynthetic pathway. Herein we report the isolation,  physical characterization, and dissection of the expression patterns of the  single gene encoding 5'-phosphoribosyl-4-(N-succinocarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole  synthetase. This enzyme, encoded by the PUR7 gene, catalyzes aspartate addition  at the alpha-amino group to the growing purine backbone. The expression of the  PUR7 as directed by the 5' region, containing the promoter, mRNA leader, and  leader intron, was examined in Arabidopsis using a transgenic reporter system.  Our analysis demonstrates that the highest level of purine biosynthesis occurs in  mitotically active tissues of the plant. Furthermore, purine biosynthesis appears  to be under developmental and hormonal regulation. Inhibition of purine  biosynthesis using substrate analogs results in arrested plant development and  induction of purine gene expression. Purine nucleotides and their derivatives  provide multiple cofactors for a variety of metabolic processes. Our findings  begin to identify some of the regulatory mechanisms that affect the production of  purine nucleotides in Arabidopsis and may give important insights into nitrogen  metabolism in general.", '1996 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.3.905', 'Meagher']
