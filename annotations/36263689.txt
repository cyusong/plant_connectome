AVRPPHB SUSCEPTIBLE 3 (PBS3) belongs to the GH3 family of acyl acid amido synthetases, which conjugates amino acids to diverse acyl acid substrates. Recent studies demonstrate that PBS3 in Arabidopsis plays a key role in the biosynthesis of plant defense hormone salicylic acid (SA) by catalyzing the conjugation of glutamate to isochorismate to form isochorismate-9-glutamate, which is then used to produce SA through spontaneous decay or ENHANCED PSEUDOMONAS SUSCEPTIBILITY (EPS1) catalysis. Consistent with its function as an essential enzyme for SA biosynthesis, PBS3 is well known to be a positive regulator of plant immunity in Arabidopsis. Additionally, PBS3 is also involved in the trade-off between abiotic and biotic stress responses in Arabidopsis by suppressing the inhibitory effect of abscisic acid on SA-mediated plant immunity. Besides stress responses, PBS3 also plays a role in plant development. Under long-day conditions, PBS3 influences Arabidopsis flowering time by regulating the expression of flowering regulators FLOWERING LOCUS C and FLOWERING LOCUS T. Taken together, PBS3 functions in the signaling network of plant development and responses to biotic and/or abiotic stresses, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its diverse roles remain obscure.
