At high concentrations, selenium (Se) exerts phytotoxic effects in non-tolerant plant species partly due to the induction of nitro-oxidative stress; however, these processes are not fully understood. In order to obtain a more accurate view of the involvement of nitro-oxidative processes in plant Se sensitivity, this study aims to characterize and compare Se-triggered changes in reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) metabolism and the consequent protein tyrosine nitration as a marker of nitrosative stress in the non-accumulator Astragalus membranaceus and the Se hyperaccumulator Astragalus bisulcatus. The observed parameters (Se accumulation, microelement homeostasis, tissue-level changes in the roots, germination, biomass production, root growth and cell viability) supported that A. membranaceus is Se sensitive while the hyperaccumulator A. bisulcatus tolerates high Se doses. We first revealed that in A. membranaceus, Se sensitivity coincides with the Se-induced disturbance of superoxide metabolism, leading to its accumulation. Furthermore, Se increased the production or disturbed the metabolism of RNS (nitric oxide, peroxynitrite and S-nitrosoglutathione), consequently resulting in intensified protein tyrosine nitration in sensitive A. membranaceus. In the (hyper)tolerant and hyperaccumulator A. bisulcatus, Se-induced ROS/RNS accumulation and tyrosine nitration proved to be negligible, suggesting that this species is able to prevent Se-induced nitro-oxidative stress.
