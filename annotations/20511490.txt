['20511490', 'XBAT32, a member of the RING domain-containing ankyrin repeat subfamily of E3  ligases, was previously identified as a positive regulator of lateral root  development. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants harboring a mutation in  XBAT32 produce fewer lateral roots that wild-type plants. We found that xbat32  mutants produce significantly more ethylene than wild-type plants and that  inhibition of ethylene biosynthesis or perception significantly increased xbat32  lateral root production. XBAT32 interacts with the ethylene biosynthesis enzymes  AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLIC ACID SYNTHASE4 (ACS4) and ACS7 in yeast-two-hybrid  assays. XBAT32 is capable of catalyzing the attachment of ubiquitin to both ACS4  and ACS7 in in vitro ubiquitination assays. These results suggest that XBAT32  negatively regulates ethylene biosynthesis by modulating the abundance of ACS  proteins. Loss of XBAT32 may promote the stabilization of ACSs and lead to  increased ethylene synthesis and suppression of lateral root formation. XBAT32  may also contribute to the broader hormonal cross talk that influences lateral  root development. While auxin treatments only partially rescue the lateral root  defect of xbat32, they completely restore wild-type levels of xbat32 lateral root  production when coupled with ethylene inhibition. Abscisic acid, an antagonist of  ethylene synthesis/signaling, was also found to stimulate rather than inhibit  xbat32 lateral root formation, and abscisic acid acts synergistically with auxin  to promote xbat32 lateral root production.', '2010 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.156976', 'Stone']
