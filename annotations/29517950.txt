Peroxisome organelles have a versatile metabolism whose enzymatic content can be modulated by physiological and environment-dependent cellular conditions. They are characterized by a highly active nitro-oxidative metabolism and basic elements (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and nitric oxide (NO)) with signaling properties. However, new elements have increased our understanding of the connections between peroxisomes and other cellular compartments. Furthermore, the presence of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) intensifies communication between different signaling molecules and the relationship of Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself with NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
