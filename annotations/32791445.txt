Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays an essential role in plant cellular sensing of various environmental stress signals by modulating the activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins. Leymus chinensis is a dominant forage grass widely distributed in the Eurasian Steppe that is well adapted to drought and salty soils common in the region. Through transcript profiling of L. chinensis roots, we identified a transcript predicted to encode histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HRC), a protein recently characterized in wheat. L. chinensis HRC (LcH RC) localized in the nucleus, as demonstrated using a transient gene expression method that we developed for this species. Different regions of LcHRC showed affinity for either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, but not Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings heterologously overexpressing LcHRC showed greater sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA), along with decreased expression of some ABA-induced marker genes, but no increase in ABA content. Screening a Arabidopsis cDNA yeast library identified a Tudor/PWWP/MBT-domain-containing protein (AtPWWP3) that interacts with LcHRC. AtPWWP3 also localized in the nucleus and is predicted to mediate gene expression by modifying histone deacetylation. Based on these results, we propose a functional model of LcHRC action.
