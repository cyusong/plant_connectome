Early events occurring at the surface of the female organ are critical for plant reproduction, especially in species with a dry stigma. After landing on the stigmatic papilla cells, the pollen hydrates and germinates a tube, which penetrates the cell wall and grows towards the ovules to convey the male gametes to the embryo sac. In self-incompatible species within the Brassicaceae, these processes are blocked when the stigma encounters an incompatible pollen. Based on the generation of self-incompatible Arabidopsis lines and by setting up a live imaging system, we showed that control of pollen hydration has a central role in pollen selectivity. The faster the pollen pumps water from the papilla during an initial period of 10 min, the faster it germinates. Furthermore, we found that the self-incompatibility barriers act to block the proper hydration of incompatible pollen and, when hydration is promoted by high humidity, an additional control prevents pollen tube penetration into the stigmatic wall. In papilla cells, actin bundles focalize at the contact site with the compatible pollen but not with the incompatible pollen, raising the possibility that stigmatic cells react to the mechanical pressure applied by the invading growing tube.
