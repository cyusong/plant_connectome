['23524662', 'Many key aspects of plant development are regulated by the polarized transport of  the phytohormone auxin. Cellular auxin efflux, the rate-limiting step in this  process, has been shown to rely on the coordinated action of PIN-formed (PIN) and  B-type ATP binding cassette (ABCB) carriers. Here, we report that polar auxin  transport in the Arabidopsis thaliana root also requires the action of a Major  Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporter, Zinc-Induced Facilitator-Like 1  (ZIFL1). Sequencing, promoter-reporter, and fluorescent protein fusion  experiments indicate that the full-length ZIFL1.1 protein and a truncated splice  isoform, ZIFL1.3, localize to the tonoplast of root cells and the plasma membrane  of leaf stomatal guard cells, respectively. Using reverse genetics, we show that  the ZIFL1.1 transporter regulates various root auxin-related processes, while the  ZIFL1.3 isoform mediates drought tolerance by regulating stomatal closure. Auxin  transport and immunolocalization assays demonstrate that ZIFL1.1 indirectly  modulates cellular auxin efflux during shootward auxin transport at the root tip,  likely by regulating plasma membrane PIN2 abundance. Finally, heterologous  expression in yeast revealed that ZIFL1.1 and ZIFL1.3 share H(+)-coupled K(+)  transport activity. Thus, by determining the subcellular and tissue distribution  of two isoforms, alternative splicing dictates a dual function for the ZIFL1  transporter. We propose that this MFS carrier regulates stomatal movements and  polar auxin transport by modulating potassium and proton fluxes in Arabidopsis  cells.', '2013 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.110353', 'Duque']
