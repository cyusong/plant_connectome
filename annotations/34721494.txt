Root hair formation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> is a well-established model system for epidermal patterning and morphogenesis in plants. Over the last decades, many underlying regulatory genes and well-established networks have been identified by thorough genetic and molecular analysis. In this study, we used a forward genetic approach to identify genes involved in root hair development in <i>Arabis alpina</i>, a related crucifer species that diverged from <i>A. thaliana</i> approximately 26-40 million years ago. We found all root hair mutant classes known in <i>A. thaliana</i> and identified orthologous regulatory genes by whole-genome or candidate gene sequencing. Our findings indicate that the gene-phenotype relationships regulating root hair development are largely conserved between <i>A. thaliana</i> and <i>A. alpina</i>. Concordantly, a detailed analysis of one mutant with multiple hairs originating from one cell suggested that a mutation in the <i>SUPERCENTIPEDE1</i> (<i>SCN1</i>) gene is causal for the phenotype and that <i>AaSCN1</i> is fully functional in <i>A. thaliana</i>. Interestingly, we also found differences in the regulation of root hair differentiation and morphogenesis between the species, and a subset of root hair mutants could not be explained by mutations in orthologs of known genes from <i>A. thaliana</i>. This analysis provides insight into the conservation and divergence of root hair regulation in the Brassicaceae.
