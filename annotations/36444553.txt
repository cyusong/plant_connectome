Lignin is a major component of plant cell walls and a conserved basic defense mechanism in higher plants deposited in response to aphid infection. However, the molecular mechanisms of lignin biosynthesis in response to aphid infection and the effect of lignin on aphid feeding behavior remain unclear. We report that 4-Coumarate:coenzyme A ligase 2 (Cm4CL2), a gene encoding a key enzyme in the lignin biosynthesis pathway, is induced by aphid feeding, resulting in lignin deposition and reduced aphid attack. Upstream regulator analysis showed that the expression of Cm4CL2 in response to aphid feeding was directly upregulated by CmMYB15-like, an SG2-type R2R3-MYB transcription factor. CmMYB15-like binds directly to the AC cis-element in the promoter region of Cm4CL2. Genetic validation demonstrated that CmMYB15-like was induced by aphid infection and contributed to lignin deposition and cell wall thickening, which consequently enhanced aphid resistance in a Cm4CL2-dependent manner. This study is the first to show that the CmMYB15-like-Cm4CL2 module regulates lignin biosynthesis in response to aphid feeding.
