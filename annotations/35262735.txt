WRINKLED1 (WRI1) is an important transcription factor that regulates seed oil biosynthesis. However, how WRI1 regulates gene expression during this process remains poorly understood. Here, we found that BLISTER (BLI) is expressed in maturing Arabidopsis thaliana seeds and acts as an interacting partner of WRI1. bli mutant seeds showed delayed maturation, a wrinkled seed phenotype, and reduced oil content, similar to the phenotypes of wri1. In contrast, BLI overexpression resulted in enlarged seeds and increased oil content. Gene expression and genetic analyses revealed that BLI plays a role in promoting the expression of WRI1 targets involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and regulates seed maturation together with WRI1. BLI is recruited by WRI1 to the AW boxes in the promoters of fatty acid biosynthesis genes. BLI shows a mutually exclusive interaction with the Polycomb-group protein CURLY LEAF (CLF) or the chromatin remodeling factor SWITCH/SUCROSE NONFERMENTING 3B (SWI3B), which facilitates gene expression by modifying nucleosomal occupancy and histone modifications. Together, these data suggest that BLI promotes the expression of fatty acid biosynthesis genes by interacting with WRI1 to regulate chromatin dynamics, leading to increased fatty acid production. These findings provide insights into the roles of the WRI1-BLI-CLF-SWI3B module in mediating seed maturation and gene expression.
