['11910003', 'Plant architecture is dictated by morphogenetic factors that specify the number  and symmetry of lateral organs as well as their positions relative to the primary  axis. Mutants defective in the patterning of leaves and floral organs have  provided new insights on the signaling pathways involved, but there is  comparatively little information regarding aspects of the patterning of stems,  which play a dominant role in architecture. To this end, we have characterized  five alleles of the brevipedicellus mutant of Arabidopsis, which exhibits reduced  internode and pedicel lengths, bends at nodes, and downward-oriented flowers and  siliques. Bends in stems correlate with a loss of chlorenchyma tissue at the node  adjacent to lateral organs and in the abaxial regions of pedicels. A stripe of  achlorophyllous tissue extends basipetally from each node and is positioned over  the vasculature that services the corresponding lateral organ. Map-based cloning  and complementation studies revealed that a null mutation in the KNAT1 homeobox  gene is responsible for these pleiotropic phenotypes. Our observation that  wild-type Arabidopsis plants also downregulate chlorenchyma development adjacent  to lateral organs leads us to propose that KNAT1 and ERECTA are required to  restrict the action of an asymmetrically localized, vasculature-associated  chlorenchyma repressor at the nodes. Our data indicate that it is feasible to  alter the architecture of ornamental and crop plants by manipulating these  genetically defined pathways.', '2002 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010391', 'Riggs']
