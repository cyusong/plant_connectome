['19450582', 'Full-length tyrosine decarboxylase cDNA (TyrDC) from Arabidopsis thaliana was  identified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR and isolated by RT-PCR. The  TyrDC mRNA was substantially induced by drought stress and wounding, and was  considerably decreased by salt stress. By using TyrDC protein fusions with green  fluorescent protein, an intracellular localization to the cytoplasm was shown.  Recombinant (His)(6)-TyrDC was expressed in Escherichia coli and enzymatically  characterized: it exclusively catalyzed the conversion of L-tyrosine to tyramine,  exhibited an optimum temperature of 50 degrees C, and an optimum pH at  approximately 8.5-9. Recombinant TyrDC protein formed tetramers, as shown by blue  native gel electrophoresis.', '2009 Jun 18', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2009.05.017', 'Pollmann']
