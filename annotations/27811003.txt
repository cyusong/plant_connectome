This study aimed to understand the molecular mechanisms of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)-induced toxicity and cell death in plants. Exposure of Arabidopsis to high concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. No leaf symptoms were visible after fumigation for 1 h with 10 parts per million (ppm) NO<sub>2</sub> However, 20 ppm NO<sub>2</sub> caused necrotic lesion formation and 30 ppm NO<sub>2</sub> complete leaf collapse, which had already started during the 1 h fumigation period. NO<sub>2</sub> fumigation resulted in a massive accumulation of nitrite and in protein modifications by S-nitrosylation and tyrosine nitration. Nitric oxide (NO) at 30 ppm did not trigger leaf damage or any of the effects observed after NO<sub>2</sub> fumigation. The onset of NO<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death correlated with NO and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) signaling and a decrease in antioxidants. NO- and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-accumulating mutants were more sensitive to NO<sub>2</sub> than wild-type plants. Accordingly, experiments with specific scavengers confirmed that NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are essential promoters of NO<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death. Leaf injection of 100 mM nitrite caused an increase in S-nitrosylation, NO, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and cell death suggesting that nitrite functioned as a mediator of NO<sub>2</sub>-induced effects. A targeted screening of phytohormone mutants revealed a protective role of salicylic acid (SA) signaling in response to NO<sub>2</sub> It was also shown that phytohormones were modulators rather than inducers of NO<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death. The established experimental set-up is a suitable system to investigate NO<sub>2</sub> and cell death signaling in large-scale mutant screens.
