A myriad of abiotic stress responses in plants are controlled by abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. ABA receptors can be degraded by both the 26S proteasome pathway and vacuolar degradation pathway after processing via the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins. Despite being essential for ABA signaling, the upstream regulators of ESCRTs remain unknown. Here, we report that the ESCRT-I component VPS23A is an unstable protein that is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The UEV domain of VPS23A physically interacts with the two PSAP motifs of XBAT35, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and this interaction results in the deposition of K48 polyubiquitin chains on VPS23A, marking it for degradation by 26S proteasomes. We showed that XBAT35 in plants is a positive regulator of ABA responses that acts via the VPS23A/PYL4 complex, specifically by accelerating VPS23A turnover and thereby increasing accumulation of the ABA receptor PYL4. This work deciphers how an ESCRT component is regulated in plants and deepens our understanding of plant stress responses by illustrating a mechanism whereby crosstalk between the UPS and endosome-vacuole-mediated degradation pathways controls ABA signaling.
