['30466592', 'Frequent exposure of plants to solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) results in  damaged DNA. One mechanism of DNA repair is the light independent pathway Global  Genomic Nucleotide Excision Repair (GG-NER), which repairs UV damaged DNA  throughout the genome. In mammals, GG-NER DNA damage recognition is performed by  the Damaged DNA Binding protein 1 and 2 (DDB1/2) complex which recruits the  Xeroderma Pigmentosa group C (XPC) / RAD23D complex. In the yeast Saccharomyces  cerevisiae, distinct proteins, Radiation sensitive 7 and 16 (Rad7p and Rad16p),  recognize the damaged DNA strand and then recruit the XPC homologue, Rad4p, and  Rad23p. The remainder of the proteins involved GG-NER are well conserved. DDB1,  DDB2, XPC/RAD4, and RAD23 homologues have been described in the model plant  Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study we characterize three Arabidopsis RAD7  homologues, RAD7a, RAD7b, and RAD7c. Loss of function alleles of each of the  three RAD7 homologues result in increased UV sensitivity. In addition, RAD7b and  RAD7c overexpression lines exhibited increased UV tolerance. Thus RAD7 homologues  contribute to UV tolerance in plants as well as in yeast. This is the first time  any system has been shown to utilize both the DDB1/2 and RAD7/16 damage  recognition complexes.', '2018 Dec', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.09.017', 'Schroeder']
