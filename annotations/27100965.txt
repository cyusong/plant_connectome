['27100965', 'Several pathways control time to flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana through  transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation. In recent years, mRNA  processing has gained interest as a critical regulator of flowering time control  in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms linking RNA splicing to flowering  time are not well understood. In a screen for Arabidopsis early flowering mutants  we identified an allele of BRR2a. BRR2 proteins are components of the spliceosome  and highly conserved in eukaryotes. Arabidopsis BRR2a is ubiquitously expressed  in all analyzed tissues and involved in the processing of flowering time gene  transcripts, most notably FLC. A missense mutation of threonine 895 in BRR2a  caused defects in FLC splicing and greatly reduced FLC transcript levels. Reduced  FLC expression increased transcription of FT and SOC1 leading to early flowering  in both short and long days. Genome-wide experiments established that only a  small set of introns was not correctly spliced in the brr2a mutant. Compared to  control introns, retained introns were often shorter and GC-poor, had low H3K4me1  and CG methylation levels, and were often derived from genes with a  high-H3K27me3-low-H3K36me3 signature. We propose that BRR2a is specifically  needed for efficient splicing of a subset of introns characterized by a  combination of factors including intron size, sequence and chromatin, and that  FLC is most sensitive to splicing defects.', '2016 Apr', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1005924', 'ORCID:']
