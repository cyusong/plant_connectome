Soybean cyst nematode (SCN, <i>Heterodera glycines</i> Ichinohe) causes an estimated economic loss of about USD 3 billion each year in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> L.) production worldwide. Overexpression of resistance genes against SCN provides a powerful approach to develop SCN resistance cultivars in soybean. The clarification of molecular characterization in transformation events is a prerequisite for ecological risk assessment, food safety, and commercial release of genetically modified crops. Here, we generated transgenic events harboring the BCN (beet cyst nematode) resistance <i>Hs1<sup>pro-1</sup></i> gene using the <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated method in soybean, evaluated their resistance to SCN infection, and clarified the molecular characterization of one of the transformation events. Five independent and stable inheritable transformation events were generated by an <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation method. SCN resistance tests showed the average number of developed females per plant and female index (FI) in T4 ZHs1-1, ZHs1-2, ZHs1-3, ZHs1-4, and ZHs1-5 transformation events were significantly lower than that in the nontransgenic control. Among these, the ZHs1-2 transformation event had the lowest number of developed females per plant and FI. Southern hybridization showed the exogenous target <i>Hs1<sup>pro-1</sup></i> gene was inserted in one copy and the <i>Bar</i> gene was inserted two copies in the ZHs1-2 transformation event. The exogenous T-DNA fragment was integrated in the reverse position of Chr02: 5351566-5231578 (mainly the <i>Bar</i> gene expression cassette) and in the forward position of Chr03: 17083358-17083400 (intact T-DNA, including <i>Hs1<sup>pro-1</sup></i> and <i>Bar</i> gene expression cassette) using a whole genome sequencing method (WGS). The results of WGS method and Southern hybridization were consistent. All the functional elements of exogenous T-DNA fragments were verified by PCR using specific primer pairs in the T5 and T6 ZHs1-2 transformation events. These results demonstrated that the overexpression of <i>Hs1<sup>pro-1</sup></i> gene enhanced SCN resistance, and provide an important reference for the biosafety assessment and the labeling detection in transformation event ZHs1-2.
