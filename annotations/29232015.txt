Unlike animals, plants do not have an adaptive immune system and have instead evolved sophisticated and multi-layered innate immune mechanisms. To overcome plant immunity, pathogens secrete a diverse array of effectors into the apoplast and virtually all cellular compartments to dampen immune signaling and interfere with plant functions. Here we describe the scope of the arms race throughout the cell and summarize various strategies used by both plants and pathogens. Through studying the ongoing evolutionary battle between plants and key pathogens, we may yet uncover potential ways to achieve the ultimate goal of engineering broad-spectrum resistant crops without affecting food quality or productivity.
