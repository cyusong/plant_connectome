['24693939', 'BACKGROUND: Arabinogalactan proteins are abundant proteoglycans present on cell  surfaces of plants and involved in many cellular processes, including somatic  embryogenesis, cell-cell communication and cell elongation. Arabinogalactan  proteins consist mainly of glycan, which is synthesized by post-translational  modification of proteins in the secretory pathway. Importance of the variations  in the glycan moiety of arabinogalactan proteins for their functions has been  implicated, but its biosynthetic process is poorly understood. RESULTS: We have  identified a novel enzyme in the biosynthesis of the glycan moiety of  arabinogalactan proteins. The At1g08280 (AtGALT29A) from Arabidopsis thaliana  encodes a putative glycosyltransferase (GT), which belongs to the Carbohydrate  Active Enzyme family GT29. AtGALT29A co-expresses with other arabinogalactan GTs,  AtGALT31A and AtGLCAT14A. The recombinant AtGALT29A expressed in Nicotiana  benthamiana demonstrated a galactosyltransferase activity, transferring galactose  from UDP-galactose to a mixture of various oligosaccharides derived from  arabinogalactan proteins. The galactose-incorporated products were analyzed using  structure-specific hydrolases indicating that the recombinant AtGALT29A possesses  beta-1,6-galactosyltransferase activity, elongating beta-1,6-galactan side chains and  forming 6-Gal branches on the beta-1,3-galactan main chain of arabinogalactan  proteins. The fluorescence tagged AtGALT29A expressed in N. benthamiana was  localized to Golgi stacks where it interacted with AtGALT31A as indicated by  Forster resonance energy transfer. Biochemically, the enzyme complex containing  AtGALT31A and AtGALT29A could be co-immunoprecipitated and the isolated protein  complex exhibited increased level of beta-1,6-galactosyltransferase activities  compared to AtGALT29A alone. CONCLUSIONS: AtGALT29A is a  beta-1,6-galactosyltransferase and can interact with AtGALT31A. The complex can work  cooperatively to enhance the activities of adding galactose residues 6-linked to  beta-1,6-galactan and to beta-1,3-galactan. The results provide new knowledge of the  glycosylation process of arabinogalactan proteins and the functional significance  of protein-protein interactions among O-glycosylation enzymes.', '2014 Apr 3', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-14-90', 'Geshi']
