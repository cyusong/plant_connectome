Cellulose, the main component of the plant cell wall, is synthesized by the multimeric cellulose synthase (CESA) complex (CSC). In plant cells, CSCs are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi and transported through the endomembrane system to the plasma membrane (PM). However, how CESA catalytic activity or conserved motifs around the catalytic core influence vesicle trafficking or protein dynamics is not well understood. Here, we used yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged AtCESA6 and created 18 mutants in key motifs of the catalytic domain to analyze how they affected seedling growth, cellulose biosynthesis, complex formation, and CSC dynamics and trafficking in Arabidopsis thaliana. Seedling growth and cellulose content were reduced by nearly all mutations. Moreover, mutations in most conserved motifs slowed CSC movement in the PM as well as delivery of CSCs to the PM. Interestingly, mutations in the DDG and QXXRW motifs affected YFP-CESA6 abundance in the Golgi. These mutations also perturbed post-Golgi trafficking of CSCs. The 18 mutations were divided into two groups based on their phenotypes; we propose that Group I mutations cause CSC trafficking defects whereas Group II mutations, especially in the QXXRW motif, affect protein folding and/or CSC rosette formation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the CESA6 catalytic domain is essential for cellulose biosynthesis as well as CSC formation, protein folding and dynamics, and vesicle trafficking.
