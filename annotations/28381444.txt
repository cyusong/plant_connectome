Monocot stems lack the vascular cambium and instead have characteristic structures in which intercalary meristems generate internodes and veins remain separate and scattered. However, developmental processes of these unique structures have been poorly described. BELL1-like homeobox (BLH) transcription factors (TFs) are known to heterodimerize with KNOTTED1-like homeobox TFs to play crucial roles in shoot meristem maintenance, but their functions are elusive in monocots. We found that maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) BLH12 and BLH14 have redundant but important roles in stem development. BLH12/14 interact with KNOTTED1 (KN1) in vivo and accumulate in overlapping domains in shoot meristems, young stems, and provascular bundles. Similar to <i>kn1</i> loss-of-function mutants, <i>blh12 blh14</i> (<i>blh12/14</i>) double mutants fail to maintain axillary meristems. Unique to <i>blh12/14</i> is an abnormal tassel branching and precocious internode differentiation that results in dwarfism and reduced veins in stems. Micro-computed tomography observation of vascular networks revealed that <i>blh12/14</i> double mutants had reduced vein number due to fewer intermediate veins in leaves and precocious anastomosis in young stems. Based on these results, we propose two functions of BLH12/14 during stem development: (1) maintaining intercalary meristems that accumulate KN1 and prevent precocious internode differentiation and (2) preventing precocious anastomosis of provascular bundles in young stems to ensure the production of sufficient independent veins.
