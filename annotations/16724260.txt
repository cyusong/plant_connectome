The shoot apical meristem of higher plants is characterized by a conserved pattern of cell division, the functional significance of which is unclear. Although a causal role for cell division frequency and orientation in morphogenesis has been suggested, supporting data are limited. An alternative interpretation laying stress on the control of growth vector and its integration with networks of transcription factors and hormonal signals is discussed in this review.

Transcription factor: !controls! Growth vector
Hormonal signal: !integrates with! Networks of transcription factors
Cell division frequency: !affects! Morphogenesis
Cell division orientation: !influences! Morphogenesis
