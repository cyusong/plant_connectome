['25851613', "Arabidopsis thaliana possesses six branched-chain aminotransferases (BCAT1-6).  Previous studies revealed that some members of this protein family are involved  in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids and/or in the Met chain  elongation pathway, the initial steps towards the biosynthesis of Met-derived  glucosinolates. We now analyzed branched-chain aminotransferase 6 (BCAT6). In  vivo GFP-tagging experiments strongly suggest this enzyme to be localized to the  cytosol. Substrate specificity assays performed with recombinant enzyme revealed  that BCAT6 transaminates Val, Leu and Ile as well as the corresponding 2-oxo  acids but also transaminates Met and its cognate ketoacid  4-methyl-2-oxobutanoate. We established single (bcat6-1), double  (bcat4-2/bcat6-1) and triple (bcat3-1/bcat4-2/bcat6-1) mutants involving BCAT6  with the latter exhibiting a clear macroscopic phenotype with smaller plants and  abnormal leaf morphology. Metabolite profiling of these mutants demonstrated that  BCAT6 can contribute to Met chain elongation with the triple mutant line lacking  BCAT3, 4 and 6 showing a dramatic reduction of Met-derived glucosinolate species  down to 32 and 14% of wild-type levels in plant foliage and seeds, respectively.  This drop in glucosinolate levels is accompanied by a 46-fold increase of free  Met, demonstrating the important role of the three branched-chain  aminotransferases in converting Met to its 2-oxo acid for glucosinolate chain  elongation. In addition, we determined the relative amounts of  5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine, an intermediate of the Met recycling pathway.  This metabolite accumulated to relative high amounts in the absence of the  cytosolic BCAT4 and BCAT6, suggesting that cytosolic Met salvage also contributes  to the biosynthesis of glucosinolates.", '2015 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-015-0312-3', 'Binder']
