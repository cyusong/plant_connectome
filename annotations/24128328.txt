['24128328', 'We have characterized a beta-glucuronosyltransferase (AtGlcAT14A) from Arabidopsis  thaliana that is involved in the biosynthesis of type II arabinogalactan (AG).  This enzyme belongs to the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme database  glycosyltransferase family 14 (GT14). The protein was localized to the Golgi  apparatus when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. The soluble  catalytic domain expressed in Pichia pastoris transferred glucuronic acid (GlcA)  to beta-1,6-galactooligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization (DP) ranging from  3-11, and to beta-1,3-galactooligosaccharides of DP5 and 7, indicating that the  enzyme is a glucuronosyltransferase that modifies both the beta-1,6- and  beta-1,3-galactan present in type II AG. Two allelic T-DNA insertion mutant lines  showed 20-35% enhanced cell elongation during seedling growth compared to  wild-type. Analyses of AG isolated from the mutants revealed a reduction of GlcA  substitution on Gal-beta-1,6-Gal and beta-1,3-Gal, indicating an in vivo role of  AtGlcAT14A in synthesis of those structures in type II AG. Moreover, a relative  increase in the levels of 3-, 6- and 3,6-linked galactose (Gal) and reduced  levels of 3-, 2- and 2,5-linked arabinose (Ara) were seen, suggesting that the  mutation in AtGlcAT14A results in a relative increase of the longer and branched  beta-1,3- and beta-1,6-galactans. This increase of galactosylation in the mutants is  most likely caused by increased availability of the O6 position of Gal, which is  a shared acceptor site for AtGlcAT14A and galactosyltransferases in synthesis of  type II AG, and thus addition of GlcA may terminate Gal chain extension. We  discuss a role for the glucuronosyltransferase in the biosynthesis of type II AG,  with a biological role during seedling growth.', '2013 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12353', 'Geshi']
