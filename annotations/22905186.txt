['22905186', 'Most chloroplast and mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes, whose  functions remain largely unknown because mutant alleles are lacking. A reverse  genetics screen for mutations affecting the mitochondrial transcription  termination factor (mTERF) family in Arabidopsis thaliana allowed us to identify  75 lines carrying T-DNA insertions. Two of them were homozygous for insertions in  the At4g14605 gene, which we dubbed MDA1 (MTERF DEFECTIVE IN Arabidopsis1). The  mda1 mutants exhibited altered chloroplast morphology and plant growth, and  reduced pigmentation of cotyledons, leaves, stems and sepals. The mda1 mutations  enhanced salt and osmotic stress tolerance and altered sugar responses during  seedling establishment, possibly as a result of reduced ABA sensitivity. Loss of  MDA1 function caused up-regulation of the RpoTp/SCA3 nuclear gene encoding a  plastid RNA polymerase and modified the steady-state levels of chloroplast gene  transcripts. Double mutant analyses indicated that MDA1 and the previously  described mTERF genes SOLDAT10 and RUG2 act in different pathways. Our findings  reveal a new role for mTERF proteins in the response to abiotic stress, probably  through perturbed ABA retrograde signalling resulting from a disruption in  chloroplast homeostasis.', '2012', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0042924', 'Quesada']
