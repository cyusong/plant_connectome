['16731568', 'Dimeric basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factors constitute one of the most important  classes of enhancer-type transcription factors. In vertebrates, bZIP factors are  involved in many cellular processes, including cell survival, learning and  memory, cancer progression, lipid metabolism, and a variety of developmental  processes. These factors have the ability to homodimerize and heterodimerize in a  specific and predictable manner, resulting in hundreds of dimers with unique  effects on transcription. In recent years, several studies have described  dimerization preferences for bZIP factors from different species, including Homo  sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces  cerevisiae. Here, these findings are summarized as novel, graphical  representations of closed, interacting protein networks. These representations  combine phylogenetic information, DNA-binding properties, and dimerization  preference. Beyond summarizing bZIP dimerization preferences within selected  species, we have included annotation for a solitary bZIP factor found in the  primitive eukaryote, Giardia lamblia, a possible evolutionary precursor to the  complex networks of bZIP factors encoded by other genomes. Finally, we discuss  the fundamental similarities and differences between dimerization networks within  the context of bZIP factor evolution.', '2006 Aug', 'Mol Biol Evol', '10.1093/molbev/msl022', 'Taparowsky']
