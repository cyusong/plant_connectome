['26923071', 'Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) participate in diverse  regulations of plant growth and environmental stress responses. In this work, an  Arabidopsis hnRNP of unknown function, AtRNP1, was investigated. We found that  AtRNP1 gene is highly expressed in rosette and cauline leaves, and slightly  induced under drought, salt, osmotic and ABA stresses. AtRNP1 protein is  localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. We performed homologous  overexpression of AtRNP1 and found that the transgenic plants showed shortened  root length and plant height, and accelerated flowering. In addition, the  transgenic plants also showed reduced tolerance to drought, salt, osmotic and ABA  stresses. Further studies revealed that under both normal and stress conditions,  the proline contents in the transgenic plants are markedly decreased, associated  with reduced expression levels of a proline synthase gene and several  stress-responsive genes. These results suggested that the overexpression of  AtRNP1 negatively affects plant growth and abiotic stress tolerance.', '2016 Apr 1', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.02.081', 'Liu']
