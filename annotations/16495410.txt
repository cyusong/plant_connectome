The phloem is a well-known target of sucking and piercing insects that utilize the transported fluid as their major nutrient source. In addition to small molecules like sugars and amino acids, phloem sap of higher land plants contains proteins that can accumulate up to high concentrations. Although the knowledge about the identities of these phloem sap proteins is increasing, the functions of most of them are still poorly understood. Since many phloem sap proteins have predicted roles in wound and defence responses, they constitute a class of compounds that can potentially influence plant-insect interactions. However, there are as yet no studies published that have examined direct effects of phloem sap proteins on insect feeding or vice versa. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the identities of phloem sap proteins, focused on polypeptides with probable functions in wound and defence reactions, and their potential impact on plant-insect interactions is discussed.
