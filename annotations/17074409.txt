Thellungiella halophila and Arabidopsis thaliana were irrigated with medium containing NaCl at various concentrations. The salt treatment resulted in a restriction of rosette biomass deposition in both species. In A. thaliana leaves, this inhibition was stronger than for T. halophila and was associated with strong inhibition of both leaf initiation and leaf expansion. At highest medium salinity, A. thaliana accumulated Na(+) and Cl(-) at higher levels than T. halophila, but similar leaf dehydration was observed in the two species. Proline accumulation, which increased with NaCl concentration, did not differentiate the two species. The magnitude of the electrolyte leakage and the level of lipid peroxidation (assessed through hydroxy fatty acid content) were modest in T. halophila and quite marked in A. thaliana. The detrimental effects of the salt on photosynthetic activity and stomatal conductance of A. thaliana leaves were much more important than in T. halophila leaves. The abundance of the CDSP32 thioredoxin, a critical component of the defence system against oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation, was found to be higher in T. halophila than in A. thaliana under control conditions and salt treatment. These results suggest that the rosette leaves of T. halophila exhibit more efficient protective mechanisms against Na(+) metabolic toxicity than those of A. thaliana.
