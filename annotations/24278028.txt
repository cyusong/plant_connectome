['24278028', 'Pollen tube reception involves a pollen tube-synergid interaction that controls  the discharge of sperm cells into the embryo sac during plant fertilization.  Despite its importance in the sexual reproduction of plants, little is known  about the role of gene regulation in this process. We report here that the  pollen-expressed transcription factors MYB97, MYB101 and MYB120 probably control  genes whose encoded proteins play important roles in Arabidopsis thaliana pollen  tube reception. They share a high amino acid sequence identity and are expressed  mainly in mature pollen grains and pollen tubes. None of the single or double  mutants of these three genes exhibited any visible defective phenotype. Although  the myb97 myb101 myb120 triple mutant was not defective in pollen development,  pollen germination, pollen tube growth or tube guidance, the pollen tubes of the  triple mutants exhibited uncontrolled growth and failed to discharge their sperm  cells after entering the embryo sac. In addition, the myb97 myb101 myb120 triple  mutation significantly affected the expression of a group of pollen-expressed  genes in mature pollen grains. All these results indicate that MYB97, MYB101 and  MYB120 participate in pollen tube reception, possibly by controlling the  expression of downstream genes.', '2013 Nov', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1003933', 'Ye']
