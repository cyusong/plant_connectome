['25892242', 'Polar transport of the phytohormone auxin throughout plants shapes morphogenesis  and is subject to stringent and specific control. Here, we identify basic  cellular activities connected to translational control of gene expression as  sufficient to specify auxin-mediated development. Mutants in subunits of  Arabidopsis Elongator, a protein complex modulating translational efficiency via  maturation of tRNAs, exhibit defects in auxin-controlled developmental processes,  associated with reduced abundance of PIN-formed (PIN) auxin transport proteins.  Similar anomalies are observed upon interference with tRNA splicing by  downregulation of RNA ligase (AtRNL), pointing to a general role of tRNA  maturation in auxin signaling. Elongator Protein 6 (ELP6) and AtRNL expression  patterns underline an involvement in adjusting PIN protein levels, whereas rescue  of mutant defects by auxin indicates rate-limiting activities in auxin-controlled  organogenesis. This emphasizes mechanisms in which auxin serves as a bottleneck  for plant morphogenesis, translating common cellular activities into defined  developmental readouts.', '2015 Apr 28', 'Cell Rep', '10.1016/j.celrep.2015.03.054', 'Luschnig']
