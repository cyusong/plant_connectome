Meiotic recombination is closely linked with homologous pairing and synapsis. Previous studies have shown that HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING PROTEIN2 (HOP2), plays an essential role in homologous pairing and synapsis. However, the mechanism by which HOP2 regulates crossover (CO) formation has not been elucidated. Here, we show that OsHOP2 mediates the maturation of COs by promoting homologous pairing and synapsis in rice (Oryza sativa) meiosis. We used a combination of genetic analysis, immunolocalization and super-resolution imaging to analyze the function of OsHOP2 in rice meiosis. We showed that full-length pairing, synapsis and CO formation are disturbed in Oshop2 meiocytes. Moreover, structured illumination microscopy showed that OsHOP2 localized to chromatin and displayed considerable co-localization with axial elements (AEs) and central elements (CEs). Importantly, the interaction between OsHOP2 and a transverse filament protein of synaptonemal complex (ZEP1), provided further evidence that OsHOP2 was involved in assembly or stabilization of the structure of the synaptonemal complex (SC). Although the initiation of recombination and CO designation occur normally in Oshop2 mutants, mature COs were severely reduced, and human enhancer of invasion 10 (HEI10)10 foci were only present on the synapsed region. Putting the data together, we speculate that OsHOP2 may serve as a global regulator to coordinate homologous pairing, synapsis and meiotic recombination in rice meiosis.
