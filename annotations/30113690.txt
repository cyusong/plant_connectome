Legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with bacteroids in root nodules. Following fixation in pea (Pisum sativum L.) nodules, nitrogen is reduced to amino acids that are exported via the nodule xylem to the shoot, and in the phloem to roots in support of growth. However, the mechanisms involved in amino acid movement towards the nodule vasculature, and their importance for nodule function and plant nutrition, were unknown. We found that in pea nodules the apoplasmic pathway is an essential route for amino acid partitioning from infected cells to the vascular bundles, and that amino acid permease PsAAP6 is a key player in nitrogen retrieval from the apoplasm into inner cortex cells for nodule export. Using an miRNA interference (miR) approach, it was demonstrated that PsAAP6 function in nodules, and probably in roots, and affects both shoot and root nitrogen supply, which were strongly decreased in PsAAP6-miR plants. Further, reduced transporter function resulted in increased nodule levels of ammonium, asparagine, and other amino acids. Surprisingly, nitrogen fixation and nodule metabolism were up-regulated in PsAAP6-miR plants, indicating that under shoot nitrogen deficiency, or when plant nitrogen demand is high, systemic signaling leads to an increase in nodule activity, independent of the nodule nitrogen status.
