Mobile wound signals transmitted from local damaged to distal undamaged sites induce upsurge of jasmonic acid (JA) and activation of core JA signaling, priming the whole plant for broad-spectrum resistance/immunity against future challenges. We recently characterized two jasmonate importers AtJAT3 and AtJAT4 in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> jasmonate transporter (JAT) family that cooperatively regulate the transmission of JA from leaf-to-leaf in this wound-induced systemic response/resistance (WSR). As half-molecule ATP-binding cassette transporters, AtJAT3 and AtJAT4 need to form homodimers or/and heterodimer to function. Here we show interactions in AtJAT3-AtJAT3, AtJAT3-AtJAT4, and AtJAT4-AtJAT4 pairs by both yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescent complementation assays. Furthermore, we propose a model in which the homo-/hetero-dimers of AtJAT3/AtJAT4 mediated cell-cell transport of JA drives long-distance transmission of JA signal in a self-propagation mode and give perspectives on future works to reinforce this model.
