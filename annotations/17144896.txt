Regulating the transition of meristem identity is a critical step in reproductive development. After the shoot apical meristem (SAM) acquires inflorescence meristem identity, it goes through a sequential transition to second- and higher-order meristems that can eventually give rise to floral organs. Despite ample information on the molecular mechanisms that control the transition from SAM to inflorescence meristems, little is known about the mechanism for inflorescence development, especially in monocots. Here, we report the identification of the SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) gene controlling the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem and the floral organ development. This gene encodes a putative transcription factor carrying two AP2 domains. The SNB:GFP fusion protein is localized to the nucleus. SNB is expressed in all the examined tissues, but most strongly in the newly emerging spikelet meristems. In SNB knockout plants, the transition from spikelet meristems to floral meristems is delayed, resulting in the production of multiple rudimentary glumes in an alternative phyllotaxy. The development of additional bracts interferes with subsequent floral architecture. In some spikelets, the empty glumes and lodicules are transformed into lemma/palea-like organs. Occasionally, the number of stamens and carpels is altered and an ectopic floret occurs in the axil of the rachilla. These phenotypes suggest that snb is a heterochronic mutant, affecting the phase transition of spikelet meristems, the pattern formation of floral organs and spikelet meristem determinancy.
