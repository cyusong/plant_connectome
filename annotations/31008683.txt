<i>Venturia nashicola</i> is a fungal pathogen that causes Asian pear scab disease. This pathogen is of particular importance in Northeast Asian countries, where Asian pears are grown industrially. Scab disease in Asian pear is currently controlled by fungicide spraying and this situation calls for developing scab resistant cultivars. High-quality genome data are therefore required for in-depth comparative genome analysis of different isolates of <i>V. nashicola</i> and <i>V. pyrina</i>, a closely related species, which only infects European pear plants. Here, we report the high-contiguity whole genome assembly of two <i>V. nashicola</i> isolates, which is expected to enable genome comparisons for identification of the genes involved in host range determination of <i>V. nashicola</i>.
