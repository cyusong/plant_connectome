Freezing stress is a major limiting factor in crop production. To increase frost-hardiness of crops via breeding, deciphering the genes conferring freezing-tolerance is vital. Potato cultivars (Solanum tuberosum) are generally freezing-sensitive, but some potato wild species are freezing-tolerant, including Solanum commersonii, Solanum malmeanum and Solanum acaule. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms conferring the freezing-tolerance to the wild species remain to be deciphered. In this study, five representative genotypes of the above-mentioned species with distinct freezing-tolerance were investigated. Comparative transcriptomics analysis showed that SaCBL1-like (calcineurin B-like protein) was upregulated substantially in all of the freezing-tolerant genotypes. Transgenic overexpression and known-down lines of SaCBL1-like were examined. SaCBL1-like was shown to confer freezing-tolerance without significantly impacting main agricultural traits. A functional mechanism analysis showed that SaCBL1-like increases the expression of the C-repeat binding factor-regulon as well as causes a prolonged higher expression of CBF1 after exposure to cold conditions. Furthermore, SaCBL1-like was found to only interact with SaCIPK3-1 (CBL-interacting protein kinase) among all apparent cold-responsive SaCIPKs. Our study identifies SaCBL1-like to play a vital role in conferring freezing tolerance in potato, which may provide a basis for a targeted potato breeding for frost-hardiness.
