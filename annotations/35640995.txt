Photoperiod-sensitive plants such as soybean (Glycine max) often face threats from herbivorous insects throughout their whole growth period and especially during flowering; however, little is known about the relationship between plant flowering and insect resistance. Here, we used gene editing, multiple omics, genetic diversity and evolutionary analyses to confirm that the calcium-dependent protein kinase GmCDPK38 plays a dual role in coordinating flowering time regulation and insect resistance of soybean. Haplotype 2 (Hap2)-containing soybeans flowered later and were more resistant to the common cutworm (Spodoptera litura Fabricius) than those of Hap3. gmcdpk38 mutants with Hap3 knocked out exhibited similar flowering and resistance phenotypes as Hap2. Knocking out GmCDPK38 altered numerous flowering- and resistance-related phosphorylated proteins, genes, and metabolites. For example, the S-adenosylmethionine synthase GmSAMS1 was post-translationally upregulated in the gmcdpk38 mutants. GmCDPK38 has abundant genetic diversity in wild soybeans and was likely selected during soybean domestication. We found that Hap2 was mostly distributed at low latitudes and had a higher frequency in cultivars than in wild soybeans, while Hap3 was widely selected at high latitudes. Overall, our results elucidated that the two distinct traits (flowering time and insect resistance) are mediated by GmCDPK38.

GmCDPK38: !coordinates! flowering time and insect resistance
Hap2: !flows later and is more resistant! than Hap3
GmCDPK38: !alters! phosphorylated proteins, genes, and metabolites
GmSAMS1: !post-translationally upregulated! in gmcdpk38 mutants
GmCDPK38: !has abundant genetic diversity! in wild soybeans
Hap2: !distributed at low latitudes! and selected in cultivars
Hap3: !widely selected at high latitudes!
