['17557808', 'Glycolysis is a ubiquitous pathway thought to be essential for the production of  oil in developing seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and oil crops. Compartmentation  of primary metabolism in developing embryos poses a significant challenge for  testing this hypothesis and for the engineering of seed biomass production. It  also raises the question whether there is a preferred route of carbon from  imported photosynthate to seed oil in the embryo. Plastidic pyruvate kinase  catalyzes a highly regulated, ATP-producing reaction of glycolysis. The  Arabidopsis genome encodes 14 putative isoforms of pyruvate kinases. Three genes  encode subunits alpha, beta(1), and beta(2) of plastidic pyruvate kinase. The  plastid enzyme prevalent in developing seeds likely has a subunit composition of  4alpha4beta(1), is most active at pH 8.0, and is inhibited by Glu. Disruption of  the gene encoding the beta(1) subunit causes a reduction in plastidic pyruvate  kinase activity and 60% reduction in seed oil content. The seed oil phenotype is  fully restored by expression of the beta(1) subunit-encoding cDNA and partially  by the beta(2) subunit-encoding cDNA. Therefore, the identified pyruvate kinase  catalyzes a crucial step in the conversion of photosynthate into oil, suggesting  a preferred plastid route from its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate to fatty acids.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.048629', 'Benning']
