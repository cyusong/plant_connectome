Maintaining phosphorus (Pi) homeostasis in nodules is the key to nodule development and nitrogen fixation, an important source of nitrogen for agriculture and ecosystems. <i>PHOSPHATE-TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>PHT1</i>) and its regulator <i>PHOSPHATE-STARVATION-RESPONSE1</i> (<i>PHR1</i>), which constitute the <i>PHR1-PHT1</i> module, play important roles in maintaining Pi homeostasis in different organs. However, the <i>PHR1-PHT1</i> module and its functions in nodules remain unknown. We identified one <i>PHT1</i> (<i>GmPHT1;11</i>) and four <i>PHR1</i> (<i>GmPHR1</i>) homologs in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) plants, which displayed specific expression patterns in different tissues in nodules, similar to previously reported <i>GmPHT1;1</i> and <i>GmPHT1;4</i> Through the integration of different approaches, <i>GmPHR-GmPHT1</i> modules were confirmed. Combining our results and previous reports, we established multiple <i>GmPHR-GmPHT1</i> modules acting in the infected or noninfected tissues in nodules. A single <i>GmPHR</i> had more than one <i>GmPHT1</i> target, and vice versa. Therefore, overlapping and cross-talking modules monitored the wave of available Pi to maintain Pi homeostasis in nodules, which sequentially regulated nodule initiation and development. High levels of <i>GmPHT1;11</i> enhanced Pi accumulation in nodules, increased nodule size, but decreased nodule number. Nitrogenase activity was also enhanced by <i>GmPHT1;11</i> Our findings uncover <i>GmPHR-GmPHT1</i> modules in nodules, which expands our understanding of the mechanism of maintaining Pi homeostasis in soybean plants.
