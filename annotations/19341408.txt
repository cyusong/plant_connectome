Prunus necrotic ring spot virus (PNRSV) and grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) were detected by fluoroimmunoassay using bacterial magnetic particles (BMPs), and a double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA). For the fluoroimmunoassay, fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled anti-PNRSV antibody or anti-GFLV antibody was conjugated onto BMPs of Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense MSR-1. With this method, a very low minimum antigen concentration (1 x 10(6) dilution of the original sample concentration) could be detected. Using DAS-ELISA, the minimum antigen detection concentration was the original sample concentration. Thus, comparing these two methods, a BMP-based method could increase the sensitivity up to six orders of magnitude (10(6)) higher than an ELISA-based method of detection PNRSV and GFLV.
