['21364326', 'Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid-like hormones essential for plant growth and  development. The most active forms of brassinosteroids are Brassinolide (BL) and  Castasterone (CS), which are catalyzed by members of the CYP85A family of  cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. In Arabidopsis thaliana there are two CYP85A gene  members: CYP85A1 and CYP85A2. Unlike CYP85A1, CYP85A2 mediates the conversion of  CS to BL. In contrast to mutations in CYP85A2 that result in severe dwarfism,  cyp85a1 mutants do not show any obvious morphological phenotype during vegetative  or floral development. By analyzing large-scale transcriptional activity in the  ovule of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), we determined that CYP85A1 is  abundantly expressed in wild-type but not in sporocyteless (spl) ovules lacking a  female gametophyte. Insertional T-DNA lines defective in the activity of CYP85A1  exhibit a semi-sterile phenotype, suggesting a role for the corresponding enzyme  acting at the gametophytic level. The CYP85A1 mRNA is localized in the female  gametophyte and its neighboring sporophytic cells; however, translational fusions  of the CYP85A1 promoter to uidA (GUS) showed GUS expression restricted to the  female gametophyte, suggesting that within the ovule the corresponding protein is  mostly active in gametophytic cells. A cytological analysis of heterozygous  cyp85a1/+ individuals showed that close to 50% of female gametophytes are  arrested before the first nuclear mitotic division of the haploid functional  megaspore. Our results indicate that BR biosynthesis is required for the  initiation of megagametogenesis in Arabidopsis.', '2011 Mar', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.6.3.13206', 'Vielle-Calzada']
