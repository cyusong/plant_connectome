Development of genetic varieties with improved nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) is essential for sustainable agriculture. In this study, we developed a growth system for rice wherein N was the growth-limiting factor, and identified N-responsive genes by a whole genome transcriptional profiling approach. Some genes were selected to test their functionality in NUE by a transgenic approach. One such example with positive effects on NUE is an early nodulin gene OsENOD93-1. This OsENOD93-1 gene responded significantly to both N induction and N reduction. Transgenic rice plants over-expressing the OsENOD93-1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield. This OsENOD93-1 gene was expressed at high levels in roots of wild-type (WT) plants, and its protein product was localized in mitochondria. Transgenic plants accumulated higher concentrations of total amino acids and total N in roots. A higher concentration of amino acids in xylem sap was detected in transgenic plants, especially under N stress. In situ hybridization revealed that OsENOD93-1 is expressed in vascular bundles, as well as in epidermis and endodermis. This work demonstrates that transcriptional profiling, coupled with a transgenic validation approach, is an effective strategy for gene discovery. The knowledge gained from this study could be applied to other important crops.
