Climate change, energy use and food security are the main challenges that our society is facing nowadays. Biofuels and feedstock from microalgae can be part of the solution if high and continuous production is to be ensured. This could be attained in year-round, low cost, outdoor cultivation systems using strains that are not only champion producers of desired compounds but also have robust growth in a dynamic climate. Using microalgae strains adapted to the local conditions may be advantageous particularly in Nordic countries. Here, we review the current status of laboratory and outdoor-scale cultivation in Nordic conditions of local strains for biofuel, high-value compounds and water remediation. Strains suitable for biotechnological purposes were identified from the large and diverse pool represented by saline (NE Atlantic Ocean), brackish (Baltic Sea) and fresh water (lakes and rivers) sources. Energy-efficient annual rotation for cultivation of strains well adapted to Nordic climate has the potential to provide high biomass yields for biotechnological purposes.
