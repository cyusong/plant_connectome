The plant-specific TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR (TCP) transcription factor family is most closely associated with regulating plant developmental programs. Recently, TCPs were also shown to mediate host immune signaling, both as targets of pathogen virulence factors and as regulators of plant defense genes. However, comprehensive characterization of TCP gene targets is still lacking. Loss of function of the class I TCP gene AtTCP8 attenuates early immune signaling and, when combined with mutations in AtTCP14 and AtTCP15, additional layers of defense signaling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we focus on TCP8, the most poorly characterized of the three to date. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing to identify TCP8-bound gene promoters and differentially regulated genes in the tcp8 mutant; these datasets were heavily enriched in signaling components for multiple phytohormone pathways, including brassinosteroids (BRs), auxin, and jasmonic acid. Using BR signaling as a representative example, we showed that TCP8 directly binds and activates the promoters of the key BR transcriptional regulatory genes BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1) and BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT2 (BZR2/BES1). Furthermore, tcp8 mutant seedlings exhibited altered BR-responsive growth patterns and complementary reductions in BZR2 transcript levels, while TCP8 protein demonstrated BR-responsive changes in subnuclear localization and transcriptional activity. We conclude that one explanation for the substantial targeting of TCP8 alongside other TCP family members by pathogen effectors may lie in its role as a modulator of BR and other plant hormone signaling pathways.
