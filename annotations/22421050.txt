['22421050', 'Growth and development are coordinated by an array of intercellular  communications. Known plant signaling molecules include phytohormones and hormone  peptides. Although both classes can be implicated in the same developmental  processes, little is known about the interplay between phytohormone action and  peptide signaling within the cellular microenvironment. We show that genes coding  for small secretory peptides, designated GOLVEN (GLV), modulate the distribution  of the phytohormone auxin. The deregulation of the GLV function impairs the  formation of auxin gradients and alters the reorientation of shoots and roots  after a gravity stimulus. Specifically, the GLV signal modulates the trafficking  dynamics of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED2 involved in root tropic  responses and meristem organization. Our work links the local action of secretory  peptides with phytohormone transport.', '2012 Mar 13', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2012.02.002', 'Hilson']
