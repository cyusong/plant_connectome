['15781873', 'Analysis of transcripts of 75 genes encoding putative basic leucine zipper (bZIP)  transcription factors in the Arabidopsis genome identified AtbZIP60, which was  induced by tunicamycin. AtbZIP60 encodes a predicted protein of 295 aa with a  putative transmembrane domain near its C terminus after a bZIP domain. A  truncated form of AtbZIP60 without a transmembrane domain (AtbZIP60 delta C)  fused with GFP localized to the nucleus, suggesting translocation of native  protein to the nucleus by release from the membrane. AtbZIP60 was also induced by  DTT and azetidine-2-carboxylate, which induce the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  stress response (also called the unfolded protein response). Expression of  AtbZIP60 delta C clearly activated any of three BiP and two calnexin promoters in  a dual luciferase assay using protoplasts of cultured cells. The induction was  considered to be through cis-elements plant-specific unfolded protein response  element and ER stress-response element. Interestingly, AtbZIP60 delta C also  appeared to induce the expression of AtbZIP60 through an ER stress-response  element-like sequence in the promoter of AtbZIP60. These characteristics of  AtbZIP60 imply a signal transduction pathway of the ER stress response unique to  plants.', '2005 Apr 5', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0408941102', 'Koizumi']
