Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), which is a gasotransmitter, can be biosynthesized and participates in various physiological and biochemical processes in plants. H<sub>2</sub>S also positively affects plants' adaptation to abiotic stresses. Here, we summarize the specific ways in which H<sub>2</sub>S is endogenously synthesized and metabolized in plants, along with the agents and methods used for H<sub>2</sub>S research, and outline the progress of research on the regulation of H<sub>2</sub>S on plant metabolism and morphogenesis, abiotic stress tolerance, and the series of different post-translational modifications (PTMs) in which H<sub>2</sub>S is involved, to provide a reference for future research on the mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>S action.
