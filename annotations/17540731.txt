['17540731', 'Shortly after the release of singlet oxygen ((1)O2), drastic changes in nuclear  gene expression occur in the conditional flu mutant of Arabidopsis that reveal a  rapid transfer of signals from the plastid to the nucleus. In contrast to  retrograde control of nuclear gene expression by plastid signals described  earlier, the primary effect of (1)O2 generation in the flu mutant is not the  control of chloroplast biogenesis but the activation of a broad range of  signaling pathways known to be involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses.  This activity of a plastid-derived signal suggests a new function of the  chloroplast, namely that of a sensor of environmental changes that activates a  broad range of stress responses. Inactivation of the plastid protein EXECUTER1  attenuates the extent of (1)O2-induced up-regulation of nuclear gene expression,  but it does not fully eliminate these changes. A second related nuclear-encoded  protein, dubbed EXECUTER2, has been identified that is also implicated with the  signaling of (1)O2-dependent nuclear gene expression changes. Like EXECUTER1,  EXECUTER2 is confined to the plastid. Inactivation of both EXECUTER proteins in  the ex1/ex2/flu triple mutant is sufficient to suppress the up-regulation of  almost all (1)O2-responsive genes. Retrograde control of (1)O2-responsive genes  requires the concerted action of both EXECUTER proteins within the plastid  compartment.', '2007 Jun 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0702061104', 'Apel']
