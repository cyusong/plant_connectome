Flavonoids are secondary metabolites widely distributed among angiosperms, where they play diverse roles in plant growth, development, and evolution. The regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in plants has been extensively studied at the transcriptional level, but post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational control of flavonoid biosynthesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we analysed post-translational regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in the ornamental plant Paeonia, using proteome and ubiquitylome profiling, in conjunction with transcriptome data. Three enzymes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were identified as being putative targets of ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Among these, chalcone synthase (PhCHS) was shown to have the greatest number of ubiquitination sites. We examined PhCHS abundance in petals using PhCHS-specific antibody and found that its accumulation decreased at later developmental stages, resulting from 26S proteasome-mediated degradation. We further identified a ring domain-containing protein (PhRING-H2) that physically interacts with PhCHS and demonstrated that PhRING-H2 is required for PhCHS ubiquitination. Taken together, our results suggest that PhRING-H2-mediates PhCHS ubiquitination and degradation is an important mechanism of post-translational regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in Paeonia, providing a theoretical basis for the manipulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in plants.
