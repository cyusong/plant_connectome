Root branching or lateral root formation is crucial to maximize a root system acquiring nutrients and water from soil. A lateral root (LR) arises from asymmetric cell division of founder cells (FCs) in a pre-branch site of the primary root, and FC establishment is essential for lateral root formation. FCs are known to be specified from xylem pole pericycle cells, but the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying FC establishment are unclear. Here, we report that, in Arabidopsis thaliana, a PRC2 (for Polycomb repressive complex 2) histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) methyltransferase complex, functions to inhibit FC establishment during LR initiation. We found that functional loss of the PRC2 subunits EMF2 (for EMBRYONIC FLOWER 2) or CLF (for CURLY LEAF) leads to a great increase in the number of LRs formed in the primary root. The CLF H3K27 methyltransferase binds to chromatin of the auxin efflux carrier gene PIN FORMED 1 (PIN1), deposits the repressive mark H3K27me3 to repress its expression, and functions to down-regulate auxin maxima in root tissues and inhibit FC establishment. Our findings collectively suggest that EMF2-CLF PRC2 acts to down-regulate root auxin maxima and show that this complex represses LR formation in Arabidopsis.
