The A-type response regulator ARR4 is an element in the two-component signalling network of Arabidopsis. ARR4 interacts with the N-terminus of the red/far-red light photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB) and functions as a modulator of photomorphogenesis. In concert with other A-type response regulators, ARR4 also participates in the modulation of the cytokinin response pathway. Here evidence is presented that ARR4 directly modulates the activity state of phyB in planta, not only under inductive but also under extended irradiation with red light. Mutation of the phosphorylatable aspartate to asparagine within the receiver domain creates a version of ARR4 that negatively affects photomorphogenesis. Additional evidence suggests that ARR4 activity is regulated by a phosphorelay mechanism that depends on the AHK family of cytokinin receptors. Accordingly, the ability of ARR4 to function on phyB is modified by exogenous application of cytokinin. These results implicate a cross-talk between cytokinin and light signalling mediated by ARR4. This cross-talk enables the plant to adjust light reponsiveness to endogenous requirements in growth and development.
