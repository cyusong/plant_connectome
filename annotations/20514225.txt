Various environmental and internal cues play essential roles in regulating diverse aspects of plant growth and development. Phytohormones usually coordinate multiple stimuli to directly regulate multiple developmental programs. Recent studies have provided progresses into the complexity of their cross talk. Particularly, the signaling pathways of various phytohormones have been revealed, leading to the discovery of the mechanisms of the interplay among different hormone signaling pathways. This review focuses on the recent advances of the signaling cross-talk between brassinosteroids and other hormones, including abscisic acid, auxin, gibberellins, ethylene and jasmonate.
