Drought stress restricts crop productivity and exacerbates food shortages. The plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), has been shown to be a pivotal player in the regulation of drought tolerance and seed germination in plants. ABA accumulates under abiotic stresses to promote miR159 expression. miR159 is an ancient and conserved plant miRNA that plays diverse roles in plant development, seed germination, and drought response in Arabidopsis. Our previous studies demonstrated that miR159 regulates the vegetative phase change by repressing the ABI5 activation and thereafter preventing hyperactivation of miR156. However, whether the miR159-MYB33-ABI5 module plays a role in seed germination and drought response, and if so, how they interact genetically, remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that loss-of-function of miR159 (mir159ab) confers enhanced drought tolerance and hypersensitivity of seed germination to ABA. Genetic analyses demonstrated that loss-of-function mutation in the ABI5 gene suppresses the hypersensitivity of mir159ab to ABA, and the insensitivity of myb33 seeds to ABA treatment is ABI5 dependent. ABI5 functions downstream of MYB33 and miR159 in response to ABA. Therefore, our results uncover a new role for the miR159-MYB33-ABI5 module in the regulation of drought response and seed germination in plants.
