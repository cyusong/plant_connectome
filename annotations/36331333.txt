Low temperature affects the yield and quality of crops. Inducer of CBF expression 1 (ICE1) plays a positive role in plant cold tolerance by promoting the expression of CRT binding factor (CBF) and cold-responsive (COR) genes. Several ICE1-interacting transcription factors (TFs) that regulate plant cold tolerance have been identified. However, how these TFs affect the function of ICE1 and CBF expression under cold conditions remains unclear. Here, we identified the MYC-type TF MdbHLH4, a negative regulator of cold tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and apple (Malus domestica) plants. Under cold conditions, MdbHLH4 inhibits the expression of MdCBF1 and MdCBF3 by directly binding to their promoters. It also interacts with MdICE1L, a homolog of AtICE1 in apple, and inhibits the binding of MdICE1L to the promoters of MdCBF1/3 and thus their expression. We showed that MdCAX3L-2, a Ca2+/H+ exchanger (CAX) family gene that negatively regulates plant cold tolerance, is also a direct target of MdbHLH4. MdbHLH4 reduced apple cold tolerance by promoting MdCAX3L-2 expression. Moreover, overexpression of either MdCAX3L-2 or MdbHLH4 promoted the cold-induced ubiquitination and degradation of MdICE1L. Overall, our results reveal that MdbHLH4 negatively regulates plant cold tolerance by inhibiting MdCBF1/3 expression and MdICE1L promoter-binding activity, as well as by promoting MdCAX3L-2 expression and cold-induced MdICE1L degradation. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which ICE1-interacting TFs regulate CBF expression and ICE1 function and thus plant cold tolerance.
