Flavonoids have strong free radical scavenging and antioxidant capacity. The high abundance of flavonoids in Chinese prickly ash peels have many benefits to human health. In this study, 'Hancheng Dahongpao', a main cultivar, was taken as materials to investigate the flavonoids biosynthesis mechanism of Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim at three key development stages by integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis. A total of 19 differentially accumulated metabolites were identified, the key flavonoids compounds were kaempferol, quercetin and their glycoside derivatives, and two major anthocyanins (peonidin O-hexoside and peonidin 3-O-glucoside). 5 gene networks/modules including 15 important candidate genes were identified, which was highly correlated with flavonoids. Among these genes, ZM-163828 and ZM-184209 were strongly correlated with kaempferol and quercetin, and ZM-125833 and ZM-97481 were controlled the anthocyanins biosynthesis. Moreover, it was shown that MYB-ZM1, MYB-ZM3, MYB-ZM5, MYB-ZM6 and MYB-ZM7 coordinately controlled flavonoids accumulation through regulating the structural genes. Generally, this study systematically revealed the flavonoids metabolic pathways and candidate genes involved in flavonoids biosynthesis and laid a foundation for the potential targets for the breeding of new valuable Chinese prickly ash cultivars.
