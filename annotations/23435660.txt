['23435660', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana Elongator complex subunit2 (ELP2) genetically interacts  with NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES1 (NPR1), a key transcription  coactivator of plant immunity, and regulates the induction kinetics of defense  genes. However, the mechanistic relationship between ELP2 and NPR1 and how ELP2  regulates the kinetics of defense gene induction are unclear. Here, we  demonstrate that ELP2 is an epigenetic regulator required for pathogen-induced  rapid transcriptome reprogramming. We show that ELP2 functions in a  transcriptional feed-forward loop regulating both NPR1 and its target genes. An  elp2 mutation increases the total methylcytosine number, reduces the average  methylation levels of methylcytosines, and alters (increases or decreases)  methylation levels of specific methylcytosines. Interestingly, infection of  plants with the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato  DC3000/avrRpt2 induces biphasic changes in DNA methylation levels of NPR1 and  PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4), which encodes another key regulator of plant  immunity. These dynamic changes are blocked by the elp2 mutation, which is  correlated with delayed induction of NPR1 and PAD4. The elp2 mutation also  reduces basal histone acetylation levels in the coding regions of several defense  genes. Together, our data demonstrate a new role for Elongator in somatic DNA  demethylation/methylation and suggest a function for Elongator-mediated chromatin  regulation in pathogen-induced transcriptome reprogramming.', '2013 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.109116', 'Mou']
