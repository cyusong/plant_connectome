Silvicultural practices greatly improve the economic value of wood products from forests. Stem dimensions, wood density, and stem form are closely linked to end-product performance. This research aimed to examine the effects of stand density and stem height on variables that reflect ring growth and wood properties of <i>Sassafras tzumu</i> stands during the self-thinning phase. Between the ages of 10 and 40 years, the number of stems per hectare has declined from 1,068 to 964 due to density-dependent mortality. As the relative stand density decreased, there were significant reductions in the average tree ring width (5.07-3.51 mm) and increases in latewood proportions (49.88-53.49%) and the density of the annual growth ring (165.60-708.58 kg/m<sup>3</sup>). Therefore, ring density, earlywood density, and latewood density increased with decreasing relative stand density after self-thinning occurred. Ring width, earlywood width, and latewood width significantly increased from the base to the apex of the stem. Stand density and stem height had additive effects on <i>S. tzumu</i> wood properties during the self-thinning phase. A shift in the growth allocation along the longitudinal stem in response to self-thinning resulted in decreasing radial growth, increasing wood density, and improved stem form. In summary, we found a significant influence of stand density on tree ring growth, wood quality, and stem form of <i>S. tzumu</i> trees during the self-thinning phase.
