<i>Phytophthora capsici</i> is a destructive oomycete pathogen that causes devastating disease in black pepper, resulting in a significant decline in yield and economic losses. <i>Piper nigrum</i> (black pepper) is documented as susceptible to <i>P. capsici</i>, whereas its close relative <i>Piper flaviflorum</i> is known to be resistant. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the resistance of <i>P. flaviflorum</i> remains obscure. In this study, we conducted a comparative transcriptome and metabolome analysis between <i>P. flaviflorum</i> and <i>P. nigrum</i> upon <i>P. capsici</i> infection and found substantial differences in their gene expression profiles, with altered genes being significantly enriched in terms relating to plant-pathogen interaction, phytohormone signal transduction, and secondary metabolic pathways, including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Further metabolome analysis revealed the resistant <i>P. flaviflorum</i> to have a high background endogenous ABA reservoir and time-course-dependent accumulation of ABA and SA upon <i>P. capsici</i> inoculation, while the susceptible <i>P. nigrum</i> had a high background endogenous IAA reservoir and time-course-dependent accumulation of JA-Ile, the active form of JA. Investigation of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis metabolome further indicated the resistant <i>P. flaviflorum</i> to have more accumulation of lignin precursors than the susceptible <i>P. nigrum</i>, resulting in a higher accumulation after inoculation. This study provides an overall characterization of biologically important pathways underlying the resistance of <i>P. flaviflorum</i>, which theoretically explains the advantage of using this species as rootstock for the management of oomycete pathogen in black pepper production.
