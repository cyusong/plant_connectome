['25641249', "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the major model proposed for Agrobacterium  T-DNA integration into the plant genome. In animal cells, several proteins,  including KU70, KU80, ARTEMIS, DNA-PKcs, DNA ligase IV (LIG4), Ataxia  telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR), play an important  role in 'classical' (c)NHEJ. Other proteins, including histone H1 (HON1), XRCC1,  and PARP1, participate in a 'backup' (b)NHEJ process. We examined transient and  stable transformation frequencies of Arabidopsis thaliana roots mutant for  numerous NHEJ and other related genes. Mutants of KU70, KU80, and the  plant-specific DNA Ligase VI (LIG6) showed increased stable transformation  susceptibility. However, these mutants showed transient transformation  susceptibility similar to that of wild-type plants, suggesting enhanced T-DNA  integration in these mutants. These results were confirmed using a promoter-trap  transformation vector that requires T-DNA integration into the plant genome to  activate a promoterless gusA (uidA) gene, by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)  of Nicotiana benthamiana NHEJ genes, and by biochemical assays for T-DNA  integration. No alteration in transient or stable transformation frequencies was  detected with atm, atr, lig4, xrcc1, or parp1 mutants. However, mutation of parp1  caused high levels of T-DNA integration and transgene methylation. A double  mutant (ku80/parp1), knocking out components of both NHEJ pathways, did not show  any decrease in stable transformation or T-DNA integration. Thus, T-DNA  integration does not require known NHEJ proteins, suggesting an alternative route  for integration.", '2015 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12779', 'Gelvin']
