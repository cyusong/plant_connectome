['16146519', 'The DNA damage response and DNA recombination are two interrelated mechanisms  involved in maintaining the integrity of the genome, but in plants they are  poorly understood. RecQ is a family of genes with conserved roles in the  regulation of DNA recombination in eukaryotes; there are seven members in  Arabidopsis. Here we report on the functional analysis of the Arabidopsis RecQl4A  gene. Ectopic expression of Arabidopsis RecQl4A in yeast RecQ-deficient cells  suppressed their hypersensitivity to the DNA-damaging drug methyl  methanesulfonate (MMS) and enhanced their rate of homologous recombination (HR).  Analysis of three recQl4A mutant alleles revealed no obvious developmental  defects or telomere deregulation in plants grown under standard growth  conditions. Compared with wild-type Arabidopsis, the recQl4A mutant seedlings  were found to be hypersensitive to UV light and MMS, and more resistant to  mitomycin C. The average frequency of intrachromosomal HR in recQl4A mutant  plants was increased 7.5-fold over that observed in wild-type plants. The data  reveal roles for Arabidopsis RecQl4A in maintenance of genome stability by  modulation of the DNA damage response and suppression of HR.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02501.x', 'Dijkwel']
