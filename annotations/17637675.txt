['17637675', 'Jasmonates are essential phytohormones for plant development and survival.  However, the molecular details of their signalling pathway remain largely  unknown. The identification more than a decade ago of COI1 as an F-box protein  suggested the existence of a repressor of jasmonate responses that is targeted by  the SCF(COI1) complex for proteasome degradation in response to jasmonate. Here  we report the identification of JASMONATE-INSENSITIVE 3 (JAI3) and a family of  related proteins named JAZ (jasmonate ZIM-domain), in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our  results demonstrate that JAI3 and other JAZs are direct targets of the SCF(COI1)  E3 ubiquitin ligase and jasmonate treatment induces their proteasome degradation.  Moreover, JAI3 negatively regulates the key transcriptional activator of  jasmonate responses, MYC2. The JAZ family therefore represents the molecular link  between the two previously known steps in the jasmonate pathway. Furthermore, we  demonstrate the existence of a regulatory feed-back loop involving MYC2 and JAZ  proteins, which provides a mechanistic explanation for the pulsed response to  jasmonate and the subsequent desensitization of the cell.', '2007 Aug 9', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature06006', 'Solano']
