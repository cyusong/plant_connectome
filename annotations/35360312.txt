Fiber length (FL) and fiber strength (FS) are the important indicators of fiber quality in cotton. Longer and stronger fibers are preferred for manufacturing finer yarns in the textile industry. Functional markers (FMs) designed from polymorphic sites within gene sequences attributing to phenotypic variation are highly efficient when used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding superior varieties with longer FL and higher FS. The aims of this study were to develop FMs <i>via</i> kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays and to validate the efficacy of the FMs for allele discrimination and the potential value in practice application. We used four single-nucleotide polymorphism markers and 360 cotton accessions and found that two FMs, namely, D11_24030087 and A07_72204443, could effectively differentiate accessions of different genotypes with higher consistency to phenotype. The appeared frequencies of varieties harbored Hap2 (elite alleles G and T) with longer FL (> the mean of accessions with non-elite allele, 28.50 mm) and higher FS (> the mean of accessions with non-elite allele, 29.06 cN•tex<sup>-1</sup>) were 100 and 72.7%, respectively, which was higher than that of varieties harbored only on a single elite allele (G or T, 77.9 or 61.9%), suggesting a favorable haplotype for selecting varieties with superior FL and FS. These FMs could be valuable for the high-throughput selection of superior materials by providing genotypic information in cotton breeding programs.
