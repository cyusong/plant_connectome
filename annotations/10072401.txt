['10072401', 'The proper pairing, recombination, and segregation of chromosomes are central to  meiosis and sexual reproduction. The syn1 mutation was previously identified as a  synaptic mutant in a T-DNA-tagged population of plants. SYN1 has been isolated  and found to exhibit similarity to Schizosaccharomyces pombe RAD21 and RAD21-like  proteins, which are required for chromosome condensation and sister chromatid  cohesion during mitosis. Plants homozygous for syn1 are male and female sterile  and show defects in chromosome condensation and pairing beginning at leptonema of  meiosis I. Fragmentation of the chromosomes was observed at metaphase I.  Alternative promoters produced two SYN1 transcripts. One transcript was expressed  at low levels in most tissues, whereas the other was expressed only in prebolting  buds. DNA blot analyses suggest that Arabidopsis contains a small RAD21 gene  family. Consistent with the DNA blot data, a second Arabidopsis RAD21-like gene  has been identified. These results suggest that different RAD21-like proteins  play essential roles in chromosome condensation and pairing during both meiosis  and mitosis.', '1999 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.11.3.417', 'Makaroff']
