Heat acclimation enables plants to tolerate and survive short-term heat stress on hot days. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a genetically programmed heat shock response can be rapidly triggered in the temperature range of 32-38°C through activation of heat shock transcription factors (HSF). The heat shock response leads to heat acclimation and confers short-term protection against temperatures above 40°C. However, little is known about metabolic adjustments during heat acclimation.Untargeted metabolite analyses of A. thaliana seedlings revealed that levels of polyunsaturated triacylglycerols (TG) rapidly and dramatically increase during heat acclimation. TG accumulation was found to be temperature dependent in a temperature range of 32-50°C (optimum at 42°C) and reversible after a return from 37°C to normal growth temperatures. Heat-induced TGs accumulated in extra-chloroplastic compartments and increased in both roots and shoots to a similar extent. Analysis of mutants deficient in all four HSFA1 master regulator genes or the HSFA2 gene revealed that TG accumulation was not dependent on HSFs. Moreover, the TG response was not limited to heat stress because drought and salt stress also triggered an accumulation of TGs, but not short-term osmotic, cold, and high light stress. Lipid analysis revealed that heat-induced accumulation of TGs was not due to massive de novo fatty acid synthesis. It is hypothesized that TGs serve as transient stores for fatty acids that may be required for membrane remodelling during heat acclimation.
