Plant diseases are responsible for substantial crop losses each year and affect food security and agricultural sustainability. The improvement of crop resistance to pathogens through breeding represents an environmentally sound method for managing disease and minimizing these losses. The challenge is to breed varieties with a stable and broad-spectrum resistance. Different approaches, from markers to recent genomic and 'post-genomic era' technologies, will be reviewed in order to contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of host-pathogen interactions and genes, including those with small phenotypic effects and mechanisms that underlie resistance. An efficient combination of these approaches is herein proposed as the basis to develop a successful breeding strategy to obtain resistant crop varieties that yield higher in increasing disease scenarios.
