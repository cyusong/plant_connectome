Geminiviruses are ssDNA plant viruses that cause significant agricultural losses worldwide. The viruses do not encode a polymerase protein and must reprogram differentiated host cells to re-enter the S-phase of the cell cycle for the virus to gain access to the host-replication machinery for propagation. To date, 3 Beet curly top virus (BCTV) encoded proteins have been shown to restore DNA replication competency: the replication-initiator protein (Rep), the C2 protein, and the C4 protein. Ectopic expression of the BCTV C4 protein leads to a severe developmental phenotype characterized by extensive hyperplasia. We recently demonstrated that C4 interacts with 7 of the 10 members of the Arabidopsis thaliana SHAGGY-like protein kinase gene family and characterized the interactions of C4 and C4 mutants with AtSKs. Herein, we propose a model of how C4 functions.

BCTV Rep: !restores DNA replication competency!
C4 protein: !interacts with! AtSKs
C4 protein: !leads to! hyperplasia
C4 protein: !functions! model
