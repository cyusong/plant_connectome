['30790290', 'In mammalians and yeast, the splicing factor U2AF65/Mud2p functions in precursor  messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing. Arabidopsis AtU2AF65b encodes a putative  U2AF65 but its specific functions in plants are unknown. This paper examines the  function of AtU2AF65b as a negative regulator of flowering time in Arabidopsis.  We investigated the expression and function of AtU2AF65b in abscisic acid  (ABA)-regulated flowering as well as the transcript abundance and pre-mRNA  splicing of flowering-related genes in the knock-out mutants of AtU2AF65b. The  atu2af65b mutants show early-flowering phenotype under both long-day and  short-day conditions. The transcript accumulation of the flowering repressor gene  FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is reduced in the shoot apex of atu2af65b, due to both  increased intron retention and reduced transcription activation. Reduced  transcription of FLC results, at least partially, from the abnormal splicing and  reduced transcript abundance of ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5), which encodes  an activator of FLC in ABA-regulated flowering signaling. Additionally, the  expression of AtU2AF65b is promoted by ABA. Transition to flowering and splicing  of FLC and ABI5 in the atu2af65b mutants are compromised during ABA-induced  flowering. ABA-responsive AtU2AF65b functions in the pre-mRNA splicing of FLC and  ABI5 in shoot apex, whereby AtU2AF65b is involved in ABA-mediated flowering  transition in Arabidopsis.', '2019 Jul', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.15756', 'ORCID:']
