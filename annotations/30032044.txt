Trichome (also referred to as 'háo' in tea) is a key feature in both tea products and tea plant (Camellia sinensis) selection breeding. Although trichomes are used as a model for studying cell differentiation and have been well studied in many plant species, the regulation of trichome formation at the molecular level is poorly understood in tea plants. In the present study, the hairy and hairless tea plant cultivars Fudingdabaicha (FDDB) and Rongchunzao (RCZ), respectively, were used to study this mechanism. We characterised tea plant trichomes as unicellular and unbranched structures. High-throughput Illumina sequencing yielded approximately 277.0 million high-quality clean reads from the FDDB and RCZ cultivars. After de novo assembly, 161,444 unigenes were generated, with an average length of 937 bp. Among these unigenes, 81,425 were annotated using public databases, and 55,201 coding sequences and 4004 transcription factors (TFs) were identified. In total, 21,599 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between RCZ and FDDB, of which 10,785 DEGs were up-regulated and 10,814 DEGs were down-regulated. Genes involved in the DNA replication pathway were significantly enriched. Furthermore, between FDDB and RCZ, DEGs related to TFs, phytohormone signals, and cellulose synthesis were identified, suggesting that certain genes involved in these pathways are crucial for trichome initiation in tea plants. Together, the results of this study provide novel data to improve our understanding of the potential molecular mechanisms of trichome formation and lay a foundation for additional trichome studies in tea plants.
