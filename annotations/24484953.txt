['24484953', 'The LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE (LBD/ASL) gene family  encodes a class of transcription factors harboring a conserved plant-specific  lateral organ boundaries domain and plays a key role in lateral organ development  of plants. Recent studies have revealed developmental functions of some LBD genes  in Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. We have shown previously that LBD18/ASL20  promotes the emergence of lateral roots in Arabidopsis. LBD18 induces EXPANSIN14  (EXP14) expression by binding to a specific region of the EXP14 promoter. To  further understand the molecular mechanism of LBD18 acting as a transcription  factor, we isolated a protein interacting with LBD18 by screening an Arabidopsis  cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system with LBD18 as bait. We found that  GBF INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (GIP1) interacts with LBD18 in yeast and Arabidopsis  protoplasts. Reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed  overlapping expression of GIP1 and LBD18 in various tissues of Arabidopsis such  as roots, aerial parts, and rosette leaves. Transient gene expression assay  results with Arabidopsis protoplasts indicated that GIP1 enhances transcriptional  activity of LBD18 in the EXP14 promoter fused to the GUS reporter gene. These  results show that GIP1 may act as a transcriptional coactivator of LBD18.', '2014 Mar 1', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2013.11.003', 'Kim']
