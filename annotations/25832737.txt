INO80 is a conserved chromatin-remodeling factor in eukaryotes. While a previous study reported that the Arabidopsis thaliana INO80 (AtINO80) is required for somatic homologous recombination (HR), the role of AtINO80 in plant growth and development remains obscure. Here, we identified and characterized two independent atino80 mutant alleles, atino80-5 and atino80-6, which display similar and pleiotropic phenotypes, including smaller plant and organ size, and late flowering. Under standard growth conditions, atino80-5 showed decreased HR; however, after genotoxic treatment, HR in the mutant increased, accompanied by more DNA double-strand breaks and stronger cellular responses. Transcription analysis showed that many developmental and environmental responsive genes are overrepresented in the perturbed genes in atino80-5. These genes significantly overlapped with the category of H2A.Z body-enriched genes. AtINO80 also interacts with H2A.Z, and facilitates the enrichment of H2A.Z at the ends of the key flowering repressor genes FLC and MAF4/5. Our characterization of the atino80-5 and atino80-6 mutants confirms and extends the previous AtINO80 study, and provides perspectives for linking studies of epigenetic mechanisms involved in plant chromatin stability with plant response to developmental and environmental cues.
