Plum pox virus, the agent that causes sharka disease, is among the most important plant viral pathogens, affecting <i>Prunus</i> trees across the globe. The fabric of interactions that the virus is able to establish with the plant regulates its life cycle, including RNA uncoating, translation, replication, virion assembly, and movement. In addition, plant-virus interactions are strongly conditioned by host specificities, which determine infection outcomes, including resistance. This review attempts to summarize the latest knowledge regarding <i>Plum pox virus</i>-host interactions, giving a comprehensive overview of their relevance for viral infection and plant survival, including the latest advances in genetic engineering of resistant species.
