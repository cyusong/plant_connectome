Recent collections of fertile garlic (Allium sativum) accessions from Central Asia allow a detailed study of seedling developments and the evaluation of inherent variations. We hereby provide a comprehensive account of the ontogenesis of a population of garlic seedlings and their vegetative and reproductive traits. A nucleotide binding site profiling marker technology was applied to provide conclusive evidence for the cross-pollination nature of garlic, and to compare the levels of polymorphism between progeny derived from a single mother clone fertilized by several pollinators. The seedlings' population demonstrates a large variation in vegetative and reproductive characters, including bulbing ability, bulb color and size, clove number, and response to environmental conditions, similar to that of the genepool of vegetatively propagated garlic clones. In addition, a large variation in flowering and seed production ability was recorded. The understanding of garlic physiology, the availability of the large variability unleashed by sexual reproduction, and the possible utilization of sexual hybridization opens the way for genetic studies and breeding work.
