Heavy metal contamination is a major environmental and human health hazard in many areas of the world. Organic acids sequester heavy metals and protect plant roots from the effects of toxicity; however, it is largely unknown how these acids are regulated in response to heavy metal stress. Here, protein kinase SOS2L1 from apple was functionally characterized. MdSOS2L1 was found to be involved in the regulation of malate excretion, and to inhibit cadmium uptake into roots. Using the DUAL membrane system in a screen of an apple cDNA library with MdSOS2L1 as bait, a malate transporter, MdALMT14, was identified as an interactor. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation, pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation assays further indicated the interaction of the two proteins. Transgenic analyses showed that MdSOS2L1 is required for cadmium-induced phosphorylation at the Ser358 site of MdALMT14, a modification that enhanced the stability of the MdALMT14 protein. MdSOS2L1 was also shown to enhance cadmium tolerance in an MdALMT14-dependent manner. This study sheds light on the roles of the MdSOS2L1-MdALMT14 complex in physiological responses to cadmium toxicity.
