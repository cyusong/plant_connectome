The phytohormones jasmonates (JAs) regulate diverse aspects of plant growth and defense responses. The JA-ZIM domain (JAZ) family of repressors are targeted by the JA receptor Coronatine Insensitive 1 for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the 26S proteasome. We previously investigated the functions of JAZs in JA responses by analyzing <i>jaz</i> mutants of the phylogenetic group I (<i>jaz1/2/5/6</i>), group II/III (<i>jaz10/11/12</i>), group IV/V (<i>jaz3/4/7/9</i> and <i>jaz3/4/7/8/9</i>), and their high-order mutant <i>jaz1/2/3/4/5/6/7/9/10/11/12</i>. Here, we examined JA-regulated root growth, apical hook curvature, flowering time, and defense against the insect <i>Spodoptera exigua</i> in the intermediate <i>jaz</i> mutants <i>jaz1/2/5/6/10/11/12, jaz1/2/3/4/5/6/7/9</i>, and <i>jaz3/4/7/8/9/10/11/12</i>. This study shows that these <i>jaz</i> mutants differentially affect JA responses, suggesting the complexity of JA pathway in these multiple <i>jaz</i> mutants.
