In the phloem cap region of Arabidopsis plants, sulfur-rich cells (S-cells) accumulate >100 mM glucosinolates (GLS), but are biosynthetically inactive. The source and route of S-cell-bound GLS remain elusive. In this study, using single-cell sampling and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis we show that two GLS importers, NPF2.10/GTR1 and NPF2.11/GTR2, are critical for GLS accumulation in S-cells, although they are not localized in the S-cells. Comparison of GLS levels in S-cells in multiple combinations of homo- and heterografts of gtr1 gtr2, biosynthetic null mutant and wild-type plants indicate that S-cells accumulate GLS via symplasmic connections either directly from neighboring biosynthetic cells or indirectly to non-neighboring cells expressing GTR1/2. Distinct sources and transport routes exist for different types of GLS, and vary depending on the position of S-cells in the inflorescence stem. Based on these findings, we propose a model illustrating the GLS transport routes either directly from biosynthetic cells or via GTR-mediated import from apoplastic space radially into a symplasmic domain, wherein the S-cells are the ultimate sink. Similarly, we observed accumulation of the cyanogenic glucoside defensive compounds in high-turgor cells in the phloem cap of Lotus japonicus, suggesting that storage of defensive compounds in high-turgor cells may be a general mechanism for chemical protection of the phloem cap.
