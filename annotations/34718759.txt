Shade-intolerant plants rapidly elongate their stems, branches, and leaf stalks to compete with neighboring vegetation, maximizing sunlight capture for photosynthesis. This rapid growth adaptation, known as the shade-avoidance response (SAR), comes at a cost: reduced biomass, crop yield, and root growth. Significant progress has been made on the mechanistic understanding of hypocotyl elongation during SAR; however, the molecular interpretation of root growth repression is not well understood. Here, we explore the mechanisms by which SAR induced by low red:far-red light restricts primary and lateral root (LR) growth. By analyzing the whole-genome transcriptome, we identified a core set of shade-induced genes in roots of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) seedlings grown in the shade. Abiotic and biotic stressors also induce many of these shade-induced genes and are predominantly regulated by WRKY transcription factors. Correspondingly, a majority of WRKY genes were among the shade-induced genes. Functional analysis using transgenics of these shade-induced WRKYs revealed that their role is essentially to restrict primary root and LR growth in the shade; captivatingly, they did not affect hypocotyl elongation. Similarly, we also found that ethylene hormone signaling is necessary for limiting root growth in the shade. We propose that during SAR, shade-induced WRKY26, 45, and 75, and ethylene reprogram gene expression in the root to restrict its growth and development.
