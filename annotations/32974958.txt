Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are enzymes detoxifying superoxide to hydrogen peroxide while temporal developmental expression and subcellular localisation are linked to their functions. Therefore, we aimed here to reveal in vivo developmental expression, subcellular, tissue- and organ-specific localisation of iron superoxide dismutase 1 (FSD1) in Arabidopsis using light-sheet and Airyscan confocal microscopy. FSD1-GFP temporarily accumulated at the site of endosperm rupture during seed germination. In emerged roots, it showed the highest abundance in cells of the lateral root cap, columella, and endodermis/cortex initials. The largest subcellular pool of FSD1-GFP was localised in the plastid stroma, while it was also located in the nuclei and cytosol. The majority of the nuclear FSD1-GFP is immobile as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. We found that fsd1 knockout mutants exhibit reduced lateral root number and this phenotype was reverted by genetic complementation. Mutant analysis also revealed a requirement for FSD1 in seed germination during salt stress. Salt stress tolerance was coupled with the accumulation of FSD1-GFP in Hechtian strands and superoxide removal. It is likely that the plastidic pool is required for acquiring oxidative stress tolerance in Arabidopsis. This study suggests new developmental and osmoprotective functions of SODs in plants.
