We previously showed that overexpression of the rice ERF transcription factor gene <i>OsBIERF3</i> in tobacco increased resistance against different pathogens. Here, we report the function of <i>OsBIERF3</i> in rice immunity and abiotic stress tolerance. Expression of <i>OsBIERF3</i> was induced by <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i>, hormones (e.g., salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and abscisic acid), and abiotic stress (e.g., drought, salt and cold stress). OsBIERF3 has transcriptional activation activity that depends on its C-terminal region. The <i>OsBIERF3</i>-overexpressing (OsBIERF3-OE) plants exhibited increased resistance while <i>OsBIERF3</i>-suppressed (OsBIERF3-Ri) plants displayed decreased resistance to <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> and <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i>. A set of genes including those for PRs and MAPK kinases were up-regulated in OsBIERF3-OE plants. Cell wall biosynthetic enzyme genes were up-regulated in OsBIERF3-OE plants but down-regulated in OsBIERF3-Ri plants; accordingly, cell walls became thicker in OsBIERF3-OE plants but thinner in OsBIERF3-Ri plants than WT plants. The OsBIERF3-OE plants attenuated while OsBIERF3-Ri plants enhanced cold tolerance, accompanied by altered expression of cold-responsive genes and proline accumulation. Exogenous abscisic acid and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, a precursor of ethylene biosynthesis, restored the attenuated cold tolerance in OsBIERF3-OE plants while exogenous AgNO<sub>3</sub>, an inhibitor of ethylene action, significantly suppressed the enhanced cold tolerance in OsBIERF3-Ri plants. These data demonstrate that OsBIERF3 positively contributes to immunity against <i>M. oryzae</i> and <i>X. oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> but negatively regulates cold stress tolerance in rice.
