Iron is an essential element for most organisms. As an indispensable co-factor of many enzymes, iron is involved in various crucial metabolic processes that are required for the survival of plants and pathogens. Conversely, excessive iron produces highly active reactive oxygen species, which are toxic to the cells of plants and pathogens. Therefore, plants and pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to modulate iron status at a moderate level for maintaining their fitness. Over the past decades, many efforts have been made to reveal these mechanisms, and some progress has been made. In this review, we describe recent advances in understanding the roles of iron in plant-pathogen interactions and propose prospects for future studies.
