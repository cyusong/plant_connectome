['17189342', 'TPLATE was previously identified as a potential cytokinesis protein targeted to  the cell plate. Disruption of TPLATE in Arabidopsis thaliana leads to the  production of shriveled pollen unable to germinate. Vesicular  compartmentalization of the mature pollen is dramatically altered, and large  callose deposits accumulate near the intine cell wall layer. Green fluorescent  protein (GFP)-tagged TPLATE expression under the control of the pollen promoter  Lat52 complements the phenotype. Downregulation of TPLATE in Arabidopsis  seedlings and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 suspension cells results in  crooked cell walls and cell plates that fail to insert into the mother wall.  Besides accumulating at the cell plate, GFP-fused TPLATE is temporally targeted  to a narrow zone at the cell cortex where the cell plate connects to the mother  wall. TPLATE-GFP also localizes to subcellular structures that accumulate at the  pollen tube exit site in germinating pollen. Ectopic callose depositions observed  in mutant pollen also occur in RNA interference plants, suggesting that TPLATE is  implicated in cell wall modification. TPLATE contains domains similar to adaptin  and beta-COP coat proteins. These data suggest that TPLATE functions in  vesicle-trafficking events required for site-specific cell wall modifications  during pollen germination and for anchoring of the cell plate to the mother wall  at the correct cortical position.', '2006 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.040923', 'Geelen']
