Suberin in roots acts as a physical barrier preventing water/mineral losses. In Arabidopsis, root suberization is regulated by abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene in response to nutrient stresses. ABA also mediates coordination between microbiota and root endodermis in mineral nutrient homeostasis. However, it is not known whether this regulatory system is common to plants in general, and whether there are other key molecule(s) involved. We show that serotonin acts downstream of ABA in regulating suberization in rice and Arabidopsis and negatively regulates suberization in rice roots in response to salinity. We show that ABA represses transcription of the key gene (OsT5H) in serotonin biosynthesis, thus promoting root suberization in rice. Conversely, overexpression of OsT5H or supplementation with exogenous serotonin represses suberization and reduces tolerance to salt stress. These results identify an ABA-serotonin regulatory module controlling root suberization in rice and Arabidopsis, which is likely to represent a general mechanism as ABA and serotonin are ubiquitous in plants. These findings are of significant importance to breeding novel crop varieties that are resilient to abiotic stresses and developing strategies for production of suberin-rich roots to sequestrate more CO<sub>2</sub> , helping to mitigate the effects of climate change.
