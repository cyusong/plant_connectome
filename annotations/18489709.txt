['18489709', 'In contrast to the accumulated data on nuclear transport mechanisms of  macromolecules, little is known concerning the regulated release of  nuclear-exported complexes and their subsequent trans-cytoplasmic movement. The  bipartite begomovirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) facilitates the nuclear  export of viral DNA and cooperates with the movement protein (MP) to transport  viral DNA across the plant cell wall. Here, we identified a cellular  NSP-interacting GTPase (NIG) with biochemical properties consistent with a  nucleocytoplasmic transport role. We show that NIG is a cytosolic GTP-binding  protein that accumulates around the nuclear envelope and possesses intrinsic  GTPase activity. NIG interacts with NSP in vitro and in vivo (under transient  expression), and redirects the viral protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.  We propose that NIG acts as a positive contributor to geminivirus infection by  modulating NSP nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and hence facilitating MP-NSP  interaction in the cortical cytoplasm. In support of this, overexpression of NIG  in Arabidopsis enhances susceptibility to geminivirus infection. In addition to  highlighting the relevance of NIG as a cellular co-factor for NSP function, our  findings also have implications for general nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of  cellular macromolecules.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03556.x', 'Fontes']
