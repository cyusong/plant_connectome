Avoiding excessive agricultural nitrogen (N) use without compromising yields has long been a priority for both research and government policy in China<sup>1,2</sup>. Although numerous rice-related strategies have been proposed<sup>3-5</sup>, few studies have assessed their impacts on national food self-sufficiency and environmental sustainability and fewer still have considered economic risks faced by millions of smallholders. Here we established an optimal N rate strategy based on maximizing either economic (ON) or ecological (EON) performance using new subregion-specific models. Using an extensive on-farm dataset, we then assessed the risk of yield losses among smallholder farmers and the challenges of implementing the optimal N rate strategy. We find that meeting national rice production targets in 2030 is possible while concurrently reducing nationwide N consumption by 10% (6-16%) and 27% (22-32%), mitigating reactive N (Nr) losses by 7% (3-13%) and 24% (19-28%) and increasing N-use efficiency by 30% (3-57%) and 36% (8-64%) for ON and EON, respectively. This study identifies and targets subregions with disproportionate environmental impacts and proposes N rate strategies to limit national Nr pollution below proposed environmental thresholds, without compromising soil N stocks or economic benefits for smallholders. Thereafter, the preferable N strategy is allocated to each region based on the trade-off between economic risk and environmental benefit. To facilitate the adoption of the annually revised subregional N rate strategy, several recommendations were provided, including a monitoring network, fertilization quotas and smallholder subsidies.

N: !reduces! Consumption 
N: !mitigates! Nr losses 
N: !increases! N-use efficiency 
N rate strategy: !maximizes! Economic/Ecological performance 
Yield losses: !assessed! Among smallholder farmers 
Subregions: !targeted! With disproportionate environmental impacts 
Monitoring network: !proposed! To facilitate adoption of N rate strategy 
Fertilization quotas: !proposed! To facilitate adoption of N rate strategy 
Smallholder subsidies: !proposed! To facilitate adoption of N rate strategy
