Plant resistance inducers (PRIs) are compounds that protect plants from diseases by activating immunity responses. Exogenous treatment with glutamate (Glu), an important amino acid for all living organisms, induces resistance against fungal pathogens in rice and tomato. To understand the molecular mechanisms of Glu-induced immunity, we used the <i>Arabidopsis</i> model system. We found that exogenous treatment with Glu induces resistance against pathogens in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Consistent with this, transcriptome analyses of <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings showed that Glu significantly induces the expression of wound-, defense-, and stress-related genes. Interestingly, Glu activates the expression of genes induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns at much later time points than the flg22 peptide, which is a bacterial-derived PAMP. The Glu receptor-like (GLR) proteins GLR3.3 and GLR3.6 are involved in the early expression of Glu-inducible genes; however, the sustained expression of these genes does not require the GLR proteins. Glu-inducible gene expression is also not affected by mutations in genes that encode PAMP receptors (EFR, FLS2, and CERK1), regulators of pattern-triggered immunity (BAK1, BKK1, BIK1, and PBL1), or a salicylic acid biosynthesis enzyme (SID2). The treatment of roots with Glu activates the expression of PAMP-, salicylic acid-, and jasmonic acid-inducible genes in leaves. Moreover, the treatment of roots with Glu primes chitin-induced responses in leaves, possibly through transcriptional activation of <i>LYSIN-MOTIF RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 5</i> (<i>LYK5</i>), which encodes a chitin receptor. Because Glu treatment does not cause discernible growth retardation, Glu can be used as an effective PRI.
