['31812689', 'In plants, RNA interference (RNAi) plays a pivotal role in growth and  development, and responses to environmental inputs, including pathogen attack.  The intercellular and systemic trafficking of small interfering RNA  (siRNA)/microRNA (miRNA) is a central component in this regulatory pathway.  Currently, little is known with regards to the molecular agents involved in the  movement of these si/miRNAs. To address this situation, we employed a biochemical  approach to identify and characterize a conserved SMALL RNA-BINDING PROTEIN 1  (SRBP1) family that mediates non-cell-autonomous small RNA (sRNA) trafficking. In  Arabidopsis, AtSRBP1 is a glycine-rich (GR) RNA-binding protein, also known as  AtGRP7, which we show binds single-stranded siRNA. A viral vector, Zucchini  yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), was employed to functionally characterized the  AtSRBP1-4 (AtGRP7/2/4/8) RNA recognition motif and GR domains. Cellular-based  studies revealed the GR domain as being necessary and sufficient for SRBP1  cell-to-cell movement. Taken together, our findings provide a foundation for  future research into the mechanism and function of mobile sRNA signaling agents  in plants.', '2020 Feb 3', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2019.12.001', 'Lucas']
