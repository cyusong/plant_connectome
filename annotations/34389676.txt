The xylem in plants is specialized to transport water, mechanically support the plant body, and store water and carbohydrates. Balancing these functions leads to trade-offs that are linked to xylem structure. We proposed a multivariate hypothesis regarding the main xylem functions and tested it using structural equation modeling. We sampled 29 native shrub species from field sites in semiarid Southern California. We quantified xylem water transport (embolism resistance and transport efficiency), mechanical strength, storage of water (capacitance) and starch, minimum hydrostatic pressures (<i>P</i><sub>min</sub>), and proportions of fibers, vessels, and parenchyma, which were treated as a latent variable representing "cellular trade-offs." We found that xylem functions (transport, mechanical support, water storage, and starch storage) were independent, a result driven by <i>P</i><sub>min</sub><i>P</i><sub>min</sub> was strongly and directly or indirectly associated with all xylem functions as a hub trait. More negative <i>P</i><sub>min</sub> was associated with increased embolism resistance and tissue strength and reduced capacitance and starch storage. We found strong support for a trade-off between embolism resistance and transport efficiency. Tissue strength was not directly associated with embolism resistance or transport efficiency, and any associations were indirect involving <i>P</i><sub>min</sub> With <i>P</i><sub>min</sub> removed from the model, cellular trade-offs were central and related to all other traits. We conclude that xylem traits are broadly governed by functional trade-offs and that the <i>P</i><sub>min</sub> experienced by plants in the field exerts a strong influence over these relationships. Angiosperm xylem contains different cell types that contribute to different functions and that underpin trade-offs.
