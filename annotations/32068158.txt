Temperature is a key factor governing the growth and development, distribution, and seasonal behavior of plants. The entire plant life cycle is affected by environmental temperatures. Plants grow rapidly and exhibit specific changes in morphology under mild average temperature conditions, a response termed thermomorphogenesis. When exposed to chilling or moist chilling low temperatures, flowering or seed germination is accelerated in some plant species; these processes are known as vernalization and cold stratification, respectively. Interestingly, once many temperate plants are exposed to chilling temperatures for some time, they can acquire the ability to resist freezing stress, a process termed cold acclimation. In the face of global climate change, heat stress has emerged as a frequent challenge, which adversely affects plant growth and development. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent progress in dissecting the molecular mechanisms regulating plant thermomorphogenesis, vernalization, and responses to extreme temperatures. We also discuss the remaining issues that are crucial for understanding the interactions between plants and temperature.
