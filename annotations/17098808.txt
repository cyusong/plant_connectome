['17098808', 'CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON1 (CUC1), CUC2, and CUC3 define the boundary domain around  organs in the Arabidopsis thaliana meristem. CUC1 and CUC2 transcripts are  targeted by a microRNA (miRNA), miR164, encoded by MIR164A, B, and C. We show  that each MIR164 is transcribed to generate a large population of primary miRNAs  of variable size with a locally conserved secondary structure around the  pre-miRNA. We identified mutations in the MIR164A gene that deepen serration of  the leaf margin. By contrast, leaves of plants overexpressing miR164 have smooth  margins. Enhanced leaf serration was observed following the expression of an  miR164-resistant CUC2 but not of an miR164-resistant CUC1. Furthermore, CUC2  inactivation abolished serration in mir164a mutants and the wild type, whereas  CUC1 inactivation did not. Thus, CUC2 specifically controls leaf margin  development. CUC2 and MIR164A are transcribed in overlapping domains at the  margins of young leaf primordia, with transcription gradually restricted to the  sinus, where the leaf margins become serrated. We suggest that leaf margin  development is controlled by a two-step process in Arabidopsis. The pattern of  serration is determined first, independently of CUC2 and miR164. The balance  between coexpressed CUC2 and MIR164A then determines the extent of serration.', '2006 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.045617', 'Laufs']
