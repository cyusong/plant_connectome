Plant growth, productivity, and seed yield depend on the efficient uptake, metabolism, and allocation of nutrients. Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient needed in high amounts. Plants have evolved efficient and selective transport systems for nitrogen uptake and transport within the plant to sustain development, growth, and finally reproduction. This review summarizes current knowledge on membrane proteins involved in transport of amino acids and peptides. A special emphasis was put on their function in planta. We focus on uptake of the organic nitrogen by the root, source-sink partitioning, and import into floral tissues and seeds.

Membrane proteins: !facilitate! Nitrogen uptake
Nitrogen: !sustains! Plant growth and reproduction
Uptake of organic nitrogen: !occurs in! Root
Source-sink partitioning: !controlled by! Membrane proteins
Import into floral tissues and seeds: !mediated by! Membrane proteins
