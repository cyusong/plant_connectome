['33289329', 'In eukaryotes, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) is a conserved AAA+ ATPase  and a key component of the membrane trafficking machinery that promotes the  fusion of secretory vesicles with target membranes. Here, we demonstrate that the  Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains a single copy of NSF, AtNSF, which plays an  essential role in the regulation of leaf serration. The AtNSF knock-down mutant,  atnsf-1, exhibited more serrations in the leaf margin. Moreover, polar  localization of the PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) auxin efflux transporter was diffuse  around the margins of atnsf-1 leaves and root growth was inhibited in the atnsf-1  mutant. More PIN1-GFP accumulated in the intracellular compartments of atnsf-1  plants, suggesting that AtNSF is required for intracellular trafficking of PIN  between the endosome and plasma membrane. Furthermore, the serration phenotype  was suppressed in the atnsf-1 pin1-8 double mutant, suggesting that AtNSF is  required for PIN1-mediated polar auxin transport to regulate leaf serration. The  CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) transcription factor gene is up-regulated in atnsf-1  plants and the cuc2-3 single mutant exhibits smooth leaf margins, demonstrating  that AtNSF also functions in the CUC2 pathway. Our results reveal that AtNSF  regulates the PIN1-generated auxin maxima with a CUC2-mediated feedback loop to  control leaf serration. This article is protected by copyright.
