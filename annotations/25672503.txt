A 44-base-pair region in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii LHCBM9 promoter is essential for sulphur responsiveness. The photosynthetic light-harvesting complex (LHC) proteins play essential roles both in light capture, the first step of photosynthesis, and in photoprotective mechanisms. In contrast to the other LHC proteins and the majority of photosynthesis proteins, the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii photosystem II-associated LHC protein, LHCBM9, was recently reported to be up-regulated under sulphur deprivation conditions, which also induce hydrogen production. Here, we examined the sulphur responsiveness of the LHCBM9 gene at the transcriptional level, through promoter deletion analysis. The LHCBM9 promoter was found to be responsive to sulphur deprivation, with a 44-base-pair region between nucleotide positions -136 and -180 relative to the translation start site identified as essential for this response. Anaerobiosis was found to enhance promoter activity under sulphur deprivation conditions, however, alone was unable to induce promoter activity. The study of LHCBM9 is of biological and biotechnological importance, as its expression is linked to photobiological hydrogen production, theoretically the most efficient process for biofuel production, while the simplicity of using an S-deprivation trigger enables the development of a novel C. reinhardtii-inducible promoter system based on LHCBM9.
