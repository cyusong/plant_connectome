Growth-regulating factors (GRFs) are a unique family of transcription factors with well-characterized functions in plant growth and development. However, few studies have evaluated their roles in the absorption and assimilation of nitrate. In this study, we characterized the <i>GRF</i> family genes of flowering Chinese cabbage (<i>Brassica campestris</i>), an important vegetable crop in South China. Using bioinformatics methods, we identified <i>BcGRF</i> genes and analyzed their evolutionary relationships, conserved motifs, and sequence characteristics. Through genome-wide analysis, we identified 17 <i>BcGRF</i> genes distributed on seven chromosomes. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the <i>BcGRF</i> genes could be categorized into five subfamilies. RT-qPCR analysis showed that <i>BcGRF1</i>, <i>8</i>, <i>10</i>, and <i>17</i> expression clearly increased in response to nitrogen (N) deficiency, particularly at 8 h after treatment. <i>BcGRF8</i> expression was the most sensitive to N deficiency and was significantly correlated with the expression patterns of most key genes related to N metabolism. Using yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays, we discovered that BcGRF8 strongly enhances the driving activity of the <i>BcNRT1.1</i> gene promoter. Next, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which <i>BcGRF8</i> participates in nitrate assimilation and N signaling pathways by expressing it in Arabidopsis. BcGRF8 was localized in the cell nucleus and <i>BcGRF8</i> overexpression significantly increased the shoot and root fresh weights, seedling root length, and lateral root number in Arabidopsis. In addition, <i>BcGRF8</i> overexpression considerably reduced the nitrate contents under both nitrate-poor and -rich conditions in Arabidopsis. Finally, we found that BcGRF8 broadly regulates genes related to N uptake, utilization, and signaling. Our results demonstrate that BcGRF8 substantially accelerates plant growth and nitrate assimilation under both nitrate-poor and -rich conditions by increasing the number of lateral roots and the expression of genes involved in N uptake and assimilation, providing a basis for crop improvement.
