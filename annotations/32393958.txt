Crucifer flowers have a stereotypical plan and much of the floral diversity in the family is revealed only by careful observation. This statement holds true for the flower of Stanleya elata, a relative of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which exhibits a number of distinct features that highlight the value of crucifers in comparative studies. Such comparative approaches in combination with new imaging and genomic technologies provide novel insight into floral structure and diversity.
