['18583349', 'The organization and dynamics of the plant endomembrane system require both  universal and plant-specific molecules and compartments. The latter, despite the  growing wealth of information, remains poorly understood. From the study of an  Arabidopsis thaliana male gametophytic mutant, it was possible to isolate a gene  named POKY POLLEN TUBE (POK) essential for pollen tube tip growth. The similarity  between the predicted POK protein sequence and yeast Vps52p, a subunit from the  GARP/VFT complex which is involved in the docking of vesicles from the  prevacuolar compartment to the Golgi apparatus, suggested that the POK protein  plays a role in plant membrane trafficking. Genetic analysis of Arabidopsis  mutants affecting AtVPS53 or AtVPS54 genes which encode putative POK partners  shows a transmission defect through the male gametophyte for all lines, which is  similar to the pok mutant. Using a combination of biochemical approaches and  specific antiserum it has been demonstrated that the POK protein is present in  phylogenetically divergent plant species, associated with membranes and belongs  to a high molecular weight complex. Combination of immunolocalization studies and  pharmacological approaches in different plant cells revealed that the POK protein  associates with Golgi and post-Golgi compartments. The role of POK in post-Golgi  endomembrane trafficking and as a member of a putative plant GARP/VFT complex is  discussed.', '2008', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ern162', 'Bonhomme']
