In recent years the biosynthesis of auxin has been clarified with the aid of mutations in auxin biosynthesis genes. However, we know little about the effects of these mutations on the seed-filling stage of seed development. Here we investigate a key auxin biosynthesis mutation of the garden pea, which results in auxin deficiency in developing seeds. We exploit the large seed size of this model species, which facilitates the measurement of compounds in individual seeds. The mutation results in small seeds with reduced starch content and a wrinkled phenotype at the dry stage. The phenotypic effects of the mutation were fully reversed by introduction of the wild-type gene as a transgene, and partially reversed by auxin application. The results indicate that auxin is required for normal seed size and starch accumulation in pea, an important grain legume crop.
