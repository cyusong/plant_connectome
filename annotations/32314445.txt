C<sub>4</sub> plants can fix CO<sub>2</sub> efficiently using CO<sub>2</sub> -concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), but they require additional ATP. To supply the additional ATP, C<sub>4</sub> plants operate at higher rates of cyclic electron transport around photosystem I (PSI), in which electrons are transferred from ferredoxin to plastoquinone. Recently, it has been reported that the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) accumulated in the thylakoid membrane in leaves of C<sub>4</sub> plants, making it a candidate for the additional synthesis of ATP used in the CCM. In addition, C<sub>4</sub> plants have higher levels of PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5 (PGR5) expression, but it has been unknown how PGR5 functions in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. In this study, PGR5 was overexpressed in a C<sub>4</sub> dicot, Flaveria bidentis. In PGR5-overproducing (OP) lines, PGR5 levels were 2.3- to 3.0-fold greater compared with wild-type plants. PGR5-like PHOTOSYNTHETIC PHENOTYPE 1 (PGRL1), which cooperates with PGR5, increased with PGR5. A spectroscopic analysis indicated that in the PGR5-OP lines, the acceptor side limitation of PSI was reduced in response to a rapid increase in photon flux density. Although it did not affect CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, the overproduction of PGR5 contributed to an enhanced electron sink downstream of PSI.
