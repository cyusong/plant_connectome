Tight regulation of the auxin hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is crucial for plant development. Newly discovered IAA antagonists are the amide-linked tryptophan conjugates of IAA and jasmonic acid (JA). JA-Trp and IAA-Trp interfered with root gravitropism in Arabidopsis, and inhibited several responses to exogenously supplied IAA. Relatively low concentrations of the inhibitors occurred in Arabidopsis, but Pisum sativum flowers contained over 300 pmole g(-1) FW of JA-Trp. DihydroJA was an even more effective inhibitor than JA-Trp, suggesting that Trp conjugates with other JA derivatives may also be functional. JA-Trp and IAA-Trp add to the list of documented bioactive amide hormone conjugates. The only other example is JA-Ile, the recently discovered jasmonate signal. These examples establish that conjugation not only inactivates hormones, but in some cases creates novel compounds that function in hormone signaling.
