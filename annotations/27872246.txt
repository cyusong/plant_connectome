['27872246', 'The phytohormone auxin is involved in virtually every aspect of plant growth and  development. Through polar auxin transport, auxin gradients can be established,  which then direct plant differentiation and growth. Shade avoidance responses are  well-known processes that require polar auxin transport. In this study, we have  identified a mutant, shade avoidance 4 (sav4), defective in shade-induced  hypocotyl elongation and basipetal auxin transport. SAV4 encodes an unknown  protein with armadillo repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains known to  provide protein-protein interaction surfaces. C terminally yellow fluorescent  protein-tagged SAV4 localizes to both the plasma membrane and the nucleus.  Membrane-localized SAV4 displays a polar association with the shootward plasma  membrane domain in hypocotyl and root cells, which appears to be necessary for  its function in hypocotyl elongation. Cotransfection of SAV4 and ATP-binding  cassette B1 (ABCB1) auxin transporter in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) revealed  that SAV4 blocks ABCB1-mediated auxin efflux. We thus propose that polarly  localized SAV4 acts to inhibit ABCB-mediated auxin efflux toward shoots and  facilitates the establishment of proper auxin gradients.', '2017 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.01491', 'ORCID:']
