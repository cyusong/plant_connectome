Salinity is a natural and anthropogenic process that plants overcome using various responses. Salinity imposes a two-phase effect, simplified into the initial osmotic challenges and subsequent salinity-specific ion toxicities from continual exposure to sodium and chloride ions. Plant responses to salinity encompass a complex gene network involving osmotic balance, ion transport, antioxidant response, and hormone signaling pathways typically mediated by transcription factors. One particular transcription factor mega family, <i>WRKY</i>, is a principal regulator of salinity responses. Here, we categorize a collection of known salinity-responding <i>WRKYs</i> and summarize their molecular pathways. <i>WRKYs</i> collectively play a part in regulating osmotic balance, ion transport response, antioxidant response, and hormone signaling pathways in plants. Particular attention is given to the hormone signaling pathway to illuminate the relationship between <i>WRKYs</i> and abscisic acid signaling. Observed trends among <i>WRKYs</i> are highlighted, including group II <i>WRKYs</i> as major regulators of the salinity response. We recommend renaming existing <i>WRKYs</i> and adopting a naming system to a standardized format based on protein structure.
