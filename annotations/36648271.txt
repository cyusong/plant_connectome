The impending need for increasing amounts of food for the world population poses enormous challenges to agriculture. Moreover, global warming has exacerbated abiotic and biotic stresses, accelerating the emergence of new pests and pathogens which threatens crop productivity. Therefore, the scientific community urgently needs to develop innovative solutions for sustainable agriculture, notably replacing synthetic pesticides by active and highly specific biomolecules for pest control. In this context, RNA-based technologies emerge as an outstanding genetically modified organism-free approach offering versatile solutions to boost productivity while conserving and harnessing the wide variety of local landraces. Here we review recent advances in the field, including RNA synthesis approaches and the development of the nanotechnology required for RNA stabilization and delivery, and we discuss the potential of RNA as the key molecule for versatile applications in the second green revolution.
