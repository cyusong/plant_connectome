Over the last 10 yr there have been major advances in documenting and understanding dynamic changes to DNA methylation, small RNAs, chromatin modifications and chromatin structure that accompany reproductive development in flowering plants, from germline specification to seed maturation. Here I highlight recent advances in the field, mostly made possible by microscopic analysis of epigenetic states or by the ability to isolate specific cell types or tissues and apply omics approaches. I consider in which contexts there is potentially reprogramming vs maintenance or reinforcement of epigenetic states.

DNA: !affects! methylation
small RNAs: !affects! chromatin modifications
chromatin structure: !accompanies! reproductive development
microscopic analysis: !enables! understanding of epigenetic states
specific cell types/tissues: !isolates! omics approaches
reprogramming: !potentially occurs in! contexts
maintenance/reinforcement: !potentially occurs in! contexts
