From the different functions ABA exerted between the aboveground and belowground, seed and vegetative tissues, primary root and lateral root, stimulating stomatal closure and inhibiting stomatal opening, between young and senescence leaves in stomatal movement, among different cells in plasma membrane water permeability, we addressed the organ-, tissue-, cell-, physiological processes-, and development stage specificities of PYR1/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors. This specificity may reflect the spatio-temporal properties of water potentials as well as the endogenous ABA levels in detail context, which plus the various affinities among this receptor families, resulted in the specificity of the transcripts as well as genes functions. PYR1/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors may integrate the message of ABA resource (local signaling or long distance signaling) and concentration, thus fine-tuning ABA response to environmental- and developmental cues. It also evolutionally affording land plants sophisticated mechanism to survival adverse environments.
