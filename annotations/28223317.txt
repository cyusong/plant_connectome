High-temperature stress often leads to differential RNA splicing, thus accumulating different types and/or amounts of mature mRNAs in eukaryotic cells. However, regulatory mechanisms underlying plant precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing in the environmental stress conditions remain elusive. Herein, we describe that a U5-snRNP-interacting protein homolog STABILIZED1 (STA1) has pre-mRNA splicing activity for heat-inducible transcripts including <i>HEAT STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</i>s and various <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN</i>s for the establishment of heat stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our cell-based splicing reporter assay demonstrated STA1 acts on pre-mRNA splicing for specific subsets of stress-related genes. Cellular reconstitution of heat-inducible transcription cascades supported the view that STA1-dependent pre-mRNA splicing plays a role in DREB2A-dependent <i>HSFA3</i> expression for heat-responsive gene expression. Further genetic analysis with a loss-of-function mutant <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in Col background, and <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background verified that STA1 is essential in expression of necessary genes including <i>HSFA3</i> for two-step heat stress tolerance in plants. However, constitutive overexpression of the cDNA version of <i>HSFA3</i> in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background is unable to execute plant heat stress tolerance in <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> Consistently our global target analysis of STA1 showed that its splicing activity modulates a rather broad range of gene expression in response to heat treatment. The findings of this study reveal that heat-inducible STA1 activity for pre-mRNA splicing serves as a molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the plant stress tolerance to high-temperature stress.
