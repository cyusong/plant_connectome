['21772250', 'In multicellular organisms, morphogenesis relies on a strict coordination in time  and space of cell proliferation and differentiation. In contrast to animals,  plant development displays continuous organ formation and adaptive growth  responses during their lifespan relying on a tight coordination of cell  proliferation. How developmental signals interact with the plant cell-cycle  machinery is largely unknown. Here, we characterize plant A2-type cyclins, a  small gene family of mitotic cyclins, and show how they contribute to the  fine-tuning of local proliferation during plant development. Moreover, the timely  repression of CYCA2;3 expression in newly formed guard cells is shown to require  the stomatal transcription factors FOUR LIPS/MYB124 and MYB88, providing a direct  link between developmental programming and cell-cycle exit in plants. Thus,  transcriptional downregulation of CYCA2s represents a critical mechanism to  coordinate proliferation during plant development.', '2011 Jul 19', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2011.240', 'Beeckman']
