Accurately describing the light response curve of electron transport rate (<i>J</i>-<i>I</i> curve) and allocation of electron flow for ribulose biphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation (<i>J</i> <sub>C</sub>-<i>I</i> curve) and that for oxygenation (<i>J</i> <sub>O</sub>-<i>I</i> curve) is fundamental for modeling of light relations of electron flow at the whole-plant and ecosystem scales. The non-rectangular hyperbolic model (hereafter, NH model) has been widely used to characterize light response of net photosynthesis rate (<i>A</i> <sub>n</sub>; <i>A</i> <sub>n</sub>-<i>I</i> curve) and <i>J</i>-<i>I</i> curve. However, NH model has been reported to overestimate the maximum <i>A</i> <sub>n</sub> (<i>A</i> <sub>nmax</sub>) and the maximum <i>J</i> (<i>J</i> <sub>max</sub>), largely due to its asymptotic function. Meanwhile, few efforts have been delivered for describing <i>J</i> <sub>C</sub>-<i>I</i> and <i>J</i> <sub>O</sub>-<i>I</i> curves. The long-standing challenge on describing <i>A</i> <sub>n</sub>-<i>I</i> and <i>J</i>-<i>I</i> curves have been resolved by a recently developed <i>A</i> <sub>n</sub>-<i>I</i> and <i>J</i>-<i>I</i> models (hereafter, Ye model), which adopt a nonasymptotic function. To test whether Ye model can resolve the challenge of NH model in reproducing <i>J</i>-<i>I</i>, <i>J</i> <sub>C</sub>-<i>I</i> and <i>J</i> <sub>O</sub>-<i>I</i> curves over light-limited, light-saturated, and photoinhibitory <i>I</i> levels, we compared the performances of Ye model and NH model against measurements on two C<sub>3</sub> crops (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L. and <i>Glycine max</i> L.) grown in field. The results showed that NH model significantly overestimated the <i>A</i> <sub>nmax</sub> and <i>J</i> <sub>max</sub> for both species, which can be accurately obtained by Ye model. Furthermore, NH model significantly overestimated the maximum electron flow for carboxylation (<i>J</i> <sub>C-max</sub>) but not the maximum electron flow for oxygenation (<i>J</i> <sub>O-max</sub>) for both species, disclosing the reason underlying the long-standing problem of NH model-overestimation of <i>J</i> <sub>max</sub> and <i>A</i> <sub>nmax</sub>.
