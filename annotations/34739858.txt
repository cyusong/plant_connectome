Chickpea is a globally important commercial crop and a key source of protein for vegetarian populations. Though chickpea was domesticated at least 3000 years ago, research into abiotic stress tolerance has been limited compared to cereal crops such as wheat. This review investigates the impacts of heat stress on chickpea, focusing on reproductive development. The fertilisation process is particularly sensitive to environmental stress, such as drought and heat that can reduce yields by up to 70%. Current research has largely focused on breeding cultivars that reach maturity faster to avoid stress rather than true thermotolerance and little is known of the impact of heat on cellular processes. This review suggests that there is ample variation within the chickpea gene pool for selective breeding to achieve improved abiotic stress tolerance. Rates of genetic progress will improve once key QTL are identified and the link between thermotolerance and pollen viability confirmed. Other benefits may arise from better understanding of heat shock proteins and molecular chaperones and their role in the protection of reproductive processes.
