['28336771', 'LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKEs (hereafter referred to  as LBD) are plant-specific transcription factors that play important roles in a  plethora of plant growth and development. The leucine (Leu) zipper-like  coiled-coil motif in the lateral organ boundaries domain of the class I LBD  proteins has been proposed to mediate protein dimerization, but it has not been  experimentally assessed yet. LBD16 and LBD18 have been well characterized to play  important roles in lateral root development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana). Here, we investigated the role of the coiled-coil motif in the  dimerization of LBD16 and LBD18 and in transcriptional regulation and biological  function. We built the molecular models of the coiled coil of LBD16 and LBD18,  providing the probable Leu zipper models of the helix dimer. Using a variety of  molecular techniques, such as bimolecular fluorescence complementation,  luciferase complementation imaging, GST pull down, and coimmunoprecipitation  assays, we showed that the conserved Leu or valine residues in the coiled-coil  motif are critical for the dimerization of LBD16 or LBD18. Using transgenic  Arabidopsis plants that overexpress HA:LBD16 or HA:LBD16(Q) in lbd16 or HA:LBD18  or HA:LBD18(Q) in lbd18, we demonstrated that the homodimerization of LBD18  mediated by the coiled-coil motif is crucial for transcriptional regulation via  promoter binding and for lateral root formation. In addition, we found that the  carboxyl-terminal region beyond the coiled-coil motif in LBD18 acts as an  additional dimerization domain. These results provide a molecular basis for  homodimerization and heterodimerization among the 42 Arabidopsis LBD family  members for displaying their biological functions.', '2017 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.00013', 'ORCID:']
