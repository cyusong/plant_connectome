<i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> RSc0454 is predicted as a FAD-linked oxidase based on protein homologies, while it contains distinct domains of lactate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase. A previous study demonstrated that RSc0454 exhibits lactate dehydrogenase activity using pyruvate and NADH as substrates, and is essential for pathogenicity of <i>R. solanacearum</i>. Here, we genetically characterized involvement of RSc0454 on bacterial growth and expression of genes for the type III secretion system (T3SS, a pathogenicity determinant) in <i>R. solanacearum</i>. The <i>RSc0454</i> mutant grew normally in rich medium but grew faintly in host plants, and failed to grow in minimal medium. Supplementary succinate but not lactate could substantially restore some phenotypes of <i>RSc0454</i> mutants, including faint growth in host plants, diminished growth in the minimal medium, and lost pathogenicity toward host plants. Expression of T3SS genes is directly controlled by a master regulator, HrpB, and <i>hrpB</i> expression is positively regulated by HrpG and PrhG in parallel ways. Deletion of <i>RSc0454</i> substantially reduced expression levels of <i>hrpB</i> and T3SS both in vitro and in planta. Moreover, RSc0454 is revealed to be required for the T3SS expression via HrpG and PrhG, although through some novel pathway, and impaired expression of these genes was not due to growth deficiency of <i>RSc0454</i> mutants. RSc0454 is suggested to be important for redox balance inside cells, and supplementary NADH partially restored diminished growth of the <i>RSc0454</i> mutant in the minimal medium only in the presence of succinate at some moderate concentrations, indicating that the unbalanced redox in the <i>RSc0454</i> mutant might be responsible for its diminished growth in the minimal medium. Taken together, these results provide novel insights into the understanding of various biological functions of this FAD-linked oxidase RSc0454 and involvement of the redox balance on expression of the T3SS in <i>R. solanacearum</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
