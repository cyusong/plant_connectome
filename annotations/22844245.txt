['22844245', 'In numerous species, the formation of meiotic crossovers is largely under the  control of a group of proteins known as ZMM. Here, we identified a new ZMM  protein, HEI10, a RING finger-containing protein that is well conserved among  species. We show that HEI10 is structurally and functionally related to the yeast  Zip3 ZMM and that it is absolutely required for class I crossover (CO) formation  in Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, we show that it is present as numerous foci  on the chromosome axes and the synaptonemal complex central element until  pachytene. Then, from pachytene to diakinesis, HEI10 is retained at a limited  number of sites that correspond to class I COs, where it co-localises with MLH1.  Assuming that HEI10 early staining represents an early selection of recombination  intermediates to be channelled into the ZMM pathway, HEI10 would therefore draw a  continuity between early chosen recombination intermediates and final class I  COs.', '2012', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1002799', 'Grelon']
