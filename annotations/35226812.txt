Downy mildew disease of spinach, caused by the oomycete <i>Peronospora effusa</i>, causes major losses to spinach production. In this study, the 17 chromosomes of <i>P. effusa</i> were assembled telomere-to-telomere, using Pacific Biosciences high-fidelity reads. Of these, 16 chromosomes are complete and gapless; chromosome 15 contains one gap bridging the nucleolus organizer region. This is the first telomere-to-telomere genome assembly for an oomycete. Putative centromeric regions were identified on all chromosomes. This new assembly enables a reevaluation of the genomic composition of <i>Peronospora</i> spp.; the assembly was almost double the size and contained more repeat sequences than previously reported for any <i>Peronospora</i> species. Genome fragments consistently underrepresented in six previously reported assemblies of <i>P. effusa</i> typically encoded repeats. Some genes annotated as encoding effectors were organized into multigene clusters on several chromosomes. Putative effectors were annotated on 16 of the 17 chromosomes. The intergenic distances between annotated genes were consistent with compartmentalization of the genome into gene-dense and gene-sparse regions. Genes encoding putative effectors were enriched in gene-sparse regions. The near-gapless assembly revealed apparent horizontal gene transfer from Ascomycete fungi. Gene order was highly conserved between <i>P. effusa</i> and the genetically oriented assembly of the oomycete <i>Bremia lactucae</i>; high levels of synteny were also detected with <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>. Extensive synteny between phylogenetically distant species suggests that many other oomycete species may have similar chromosome organization. Therefore, this assembly provides the foundation for genomic analyses of diverse oomycetes.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
