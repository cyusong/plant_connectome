Auxin plays a key role across all land plants in growth and developmental processes. Although auxin signaling function has diverged and expanded, differences in the molecular functions of signaling components have largely been characterized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we used the nuclear Auxin Response Circuit recapitulated in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) system to functionally annotate maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) auxin signaling components, focusing on genes expressed during the development of ear and tassel inflorescences. All 16 maize auxin/indole-3-acetic acid repressor proteins were degraded in response to auxin with rates that depended on both receptor and repressor identities. When fused to the maize TOPLESS homolog RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2, maize auxin/indole-3-acetic acids were able to repress AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR transcriptional activity. A complete auxin response circuit comprising all maize components, including the ZmAFB2/3 b1 maize AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (AFB) receptor, was fully functional. The ZmAFB2/3 b1 auxin receptor was more sensitive to hormone than AtAFB2 and allowed for rapid circuit activation upon auxin addition. These results validate the conserved role of predicted auxin response genes in maize as well as provide evidence that a synthetic approach can facilitate broader comparative studies across the wide range of species with sequenced genomes.
