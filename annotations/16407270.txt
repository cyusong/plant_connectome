['16407270', 'Complex I of Arabidopsis includes five structurally related subunits representing  gamma-type carbonic anhydrases termed CA1, CA2, CA3, CAL1, and CAL2. The position  of these subunits within complex I was investigated. Direct analysis of isolated  subcomplexes of complex I by liquid chromatography linked to tandem mass  spectrometry allowed the assignment of the CA subunits to the membrane arm of  complex I. Carbonate extraction experiments revealed that CA2 is an integral  membrane protein that is protected upon protease treatment of isolated  mitoplasts, indicating a location on the matrix-exposed side of the complex. A  structural characterization by single particle electron microscopy of complex I  from the green alga Polytomella and a previous analysis from Arabidopsis indicate  a plant-specific spherical extra-domain of about 60 A in diameter, which is  attached to the central part of the membrane arm of complex I on its matrix face.  This spherical domain is proposed to contain a heterotrimer of three CA subunits,  which are anchored with their C termini to the hydrophobic arm of complex I.  Functional implications of the complex I-integrated CA subunits are discussed.', '2006 Mar 10', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M511542200', 'Braun']
