In this study, we cloned a new chitinase gene, <i>EuCHIT2</i>, from <i>Eucommia ulmoides</i> Oliver (<i>E. ulmoides</i>) using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technology and constructed an overexpression vector, pSH-35S-<i>EuCHIT</i>2, to introduce it into tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> cv. Xanthi)<i>.</i> Resistance to <i>Erysiphe cichoracearum</i> de Candolle (E.cichoracearum DC) and molecular mechanisms in the transgenic tobacco were determined by drop inoculation, spore counting, determination of physicochemical indicators, and analysis of gene expression. The chitinase activity and resistance to <i>E. cichoracearum</i> DC were significantly higher in the transgenic tobacco than in wild-type tobacco (p < 0.05). The activities of peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT), after inoculation with <i>E. cichoracearum</i> DC, were higher in the transgenic tobacco than in the wild-type. Conversely, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly lower in the transgenic tobacco than the wild-type before and after inoculation. In addition, our study also indicated that the resistance to <i>E. cichoracearum</i> DC might involve the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways, because the expression levels of pathogenesis-related gene 1 (<i>PR-1a</i>) and <i>coronatine-insensitive 1</i> (<i>COI1</i>) were significantly increased and decreased, respectively, after inoculation with <i>E. cichoracearum</i> DC. The present study supports the notion that <i>PR-1a</i> and POD participate in resistance to <i>E. cichoracearum</i> DC in the transgenic tobacco plants.
