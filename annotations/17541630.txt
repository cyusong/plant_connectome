The possible interaction of the plant hormones auxin and ethylene and the role of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase containing bacteria on ethylene production in canola (Brassica campestris) in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of growth regulators were investigated. The effects of auxin (indole-3-acetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid), auxin transport inhibitor 2-(p-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid, ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate and ethylene synthesis inhibitor L-alpha-(2-aminoethoxyvinyl)glycine hydrochloride on root elongation were concentration dependent. Exogenous addition of growth regulators influences the enzyme activities of ethylene production and we have presented here evidences that support the hypothesis that inhibitory effects of auxin on root elongation are independent of ethylene. Additionally, we have proved that inoculation of ACC deaminase containing Methylobacterium oryzae sequester ACC exuded from roots and hydrolyze them lowering the concentration of ACC in root exudates. However, the inhibitory actions of exogenous additions of auxins could not be ameliorated by bacterial inoculation that reduces ethylene concentration in canola seedlings.
