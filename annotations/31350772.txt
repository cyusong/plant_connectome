RNA interference (RNAi)-based tools are used in multiple organisms to induce antiviral resistance through the sequence-specific degradation of target RNAs by complementary small RNAs. In plants, highly specific antiviral RNAi-based tools include artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) and synthetic trans-acting small interfering RNAs (syn-tasiRNAs). syn-tasiRNAs have emerged as a promising antiviral tool allowing for the multi-targeting of viral RNAs through the simultaneous expression of several syn-tasiRNAs from a single precursor. Here, we compared in tomato plants the effects of an amiRNA construct expressing a single amiRNA and a syn-tasiRNA construct expressing four different syn-tasiRNAs against Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), an economically important pathogen affecting tomato crops worldwide. Most of the syn-tasiRNA lines were resistant to TSWV, whereas the majority of the amiRNA lines were susceptible and accumulated viral progenies with mutations in the amiRNA target site. Only the two amiRNA lines with higher amiRNA accumulation were resistant, whereas resistance in syn-tasiRNA lines was not exclusive of lines with high syn-tasiRNA accumulation. Collectively, these results suggest that syn-tasiRNAs induce enhanced antiviral resistance because of the combined silencing effect of each individual syn-tasiRNA, which minimizes the possibility that the virus simultaneously mutates all different target sites to fully escape each syn-tasiRNA.

RNAi: !induces! antiviral resistance 
amiRNA: !expresses! single amiRNA 
syn-tasiRNA: !expresses! four syn-tasiRNAs 
amiRNA: !accumulates! viral progenies 
syn-tasiRNA: !induces! enhanced antiviral resistance 
virus: !simultaneously mutates! all target sites
