To find nanoporous substrates with hydrodynamic properties useful for pollen hydration and germination, we used the glassy Silica gel and Vycor scales and pollen with different morphological and physiological traits, that of <i>Crocus vernus</i>, and that of <i>Narcissus poeticus</i>. For <i>in vitro</i> tests, the scales were spread on microscope slides, hand pollinated, and incubated. Pollen germination was evaluated with the stereomicroscope and the tube growth was explored with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The <i>in vivo</i> tests were carried out by sprinkling the stigmas of the <i>Crocus</i> plants with Silica gel scales and immediately after having pollinated them by hand, the plants were incubated. Three hours later, the stigmas were removed and treated for observation with SEM. <i>In vitro</i> the pollen of both species germinated on Silica gel with percentages similar to those of the <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> controls, accumulating fibrillary material at the interface. The tubes grew perpendicular to the surface of the scales, trying to penetrate the scales to the point of flattening with the apex. On <i>Crocus</i> stigmas sprinkled with Silica gel scales, pollen developed tubes that grew to the scales rather than penetrating the papillae. The results underline the close interaction of pollen with nanoporous artificial material, so much so that its pollen tubes are attracted to the Silica scales more than to the stigma papillae that arises from a mechanism of natural selection.

Pollen: !germinates on! Silica gel
Pollen: !attracted to! Silica scales
Pollen: !penetrates! Papillae
