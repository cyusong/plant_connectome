We present the first comprehensive proteome analysis of wheat flag leaves under water-deficit, high-nitrogen (N) fertilization, and combined treatments during grain development in the field. Physiological and agronomic trait analyses showed that leaf relative water content, total chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, and grain weight and yield were significantly reduced under water-deficit conditions, but dramatically enhanced under high-N fertilization and moderately promoted under the combined treatment. Two-dimensional electrophoresis detected 72 differentially accumulated protein (DAP) spots representing 65 unique proteins, primarily involved in photosynthesis, signal transduction, carbohydrate metabolism, redox homeostasis, stress defense, and energy metabolism. DAPs associated with photosynthesis and protein folding showed significant downregulation and upregulation in response to water-deficit and high-N treatments, respectively. The combined treatment caused a moderate upregulation of DAPs related to photosynthesis and energy and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that high-N fertilization can alleviate losses in yield caused by water-deficit conditions by enhancing leaf photosynthesis and grain storage compound synthesis.
