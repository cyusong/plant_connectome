['28848569', 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling networks represent important  means of signal transduction in plants and other eukaryotes, controlling  intracellular signaling by linking perception of environmental or developmental  cues to downstream targets. In the Arabidopsis MEKK subfamily, the MKKK19, 20,  and 21 form a highly supported clade with the Solanaceous Fertilization-Related  Kinases. In Arabidopsis, little is known about this group, except for MKKK20,  which is involved in osmotic stress. Using a directed MKKK-MKK yeast two-hybrid  (Y2H) screen, MKKK20 was found to interact only with MKK3, while a MKKK20  large-scale Y2H screen retrieved MPK18 as a direct interactant. In vitro  phosphorylation assays showed that MKKK20 phosphorylates both MKK3 and MPK18.  However, when all three kinases are combined, no synergistic effect is observed  on MPK18 phosphorylation, suggesting a direct access to MPK18, consistent with  the absence of interaction between MKK3 and MPK18 in protein-protein interaction  assays. Since mpk18 mutant plants were previously shown to be defective in  microtubule-related functions, phenotypes of mkkk20 single and mkkk20/mpk18  double mutants were investigated to determine if MKKK20 acts upstream of MPK18.  This was the case, as mkkk20 root length was shorter than WT in media containing  microtubule-disrupting drugs as previously observed for mpk18 plants.  Surprisingly, mkk3 plants were also similarly affected, suggesting the presence  of two non-complementary pathways involved in Arabidopsis cortical microtubule  function, the first including MKKK20, MKK3 and an unknown MPK; the second, a  non-canonical MAPK cascade made of MKKK20 and MPK18 that bypasses the need for an  MKK intermediate.', '2017', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2017.01352', 'Matton']
