Gene expression changes induced during graft union formation (the first month after grafting) in grapevine have been studied using whole genome microarrays. The genes differentially expressed between the rootstock and graft interface tissues of homo-grafts (Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) grafted onto CS) were compared at 3 and 28 days after grafting (dag). Graft union formation was associated with the upregulation of genes involved in secondary metabolism, cell wall, wound responses and hormone signaling. These gene expression differences were associated with the accumulation of lignin, cellulose and callose in the callus cells. Superimposed upon this, hetero-grafting between two different grapevine genotypes resulted in the further upregulation of stress and/or defense responses at the graft interface. Here we discuss the limitations of the techniques used to study the developments at the graft interface to date and future research directions to understand graft union formation in plants.
