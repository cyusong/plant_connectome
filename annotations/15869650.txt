Here the effect of jasmonic acid, methyljasmonate and Na-orthovanadate on the production of resveratrol was studied in Vitis vinifera cv. Barbera cell suspension cultures. Na-orthovanadate at 0.1 mm and 1 mm concentration was efficient in promoting the production and/or accumulation and release in the culture medium of cis-resveratrol while trans-resveratrol levels were not affected by this treatment. Methyljasmonate was highly effective in stimulating both trans- and cis-resveratrol endogenous accumulation, as well as their release into the culture medium. Cis-resveratrol was absent or detected in very low amounts in the controls. Jasmonic acid was less efficient than methyljasmonate in promoting endogenous resveratrol accumulation, but it stimulated the release in the culture medium especially of cis-resveratrol. Gel analysis was performed on control and 10 microm MeJA treated cell suspensions. Results showed an up-regulation of the stilbene synthase demonstrating that MeJA stimulated the synthesis ex-novo of this protein.

jasmonic acid: !stimulates! release of cis-resveratrol 
methyljasmonate: !stimulates! endogenous accumulation of trans- and cis-resveratrol 
Na-orthovanadate: !promotes! production and/or accumulation of cis-resveratrol 
MeJA: !up-regulates! stilbene synthase
