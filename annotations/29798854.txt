LaManna <i>et al</i> (Reports, 30 June 2017, p. 1389) found higher conspecific negative density dependence in tree communities at lower latitudes, yielding a possible mechanistic explanation for the latitudinal diversity gradient. We show that their results are artifacts of a selective data transformation and a forced zero intercept in their fitted model. A corrected analysis shows no latitudinal trend.
