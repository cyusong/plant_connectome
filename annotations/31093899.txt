A class III peroxidase from Artemisia annua has been shown to indicate the possibility of cellular localization-based role diversity, which may have implications in artemisinin catabolism as well as lignification. Artemisia annua derives its importance from the antimalarial artemisinin. The -O-O- linkage in artemisinin makes peroxidases relevant to its metabolism. Earlier, we identified three peroxidase-coding genes from A. annua, whereby Aa547 showed higher expression in the low-artemisinin plant stage whereas Aa528 and Aa540 showed higher expression in the artemisinin-rich plant stage. Here we carried out tertiary structure homology modelling of the peroxidases for docking studies. Maximum binding affinity for artemisinin was shown by Aa547. Further, Aa547 showed greater binding affinity for post-artemisinin metabolite, deoxyartemisinin, as compared to pre-artemisinin metabolites (dihydroartemisinic hydroperoxide, artemisinic acid, dihydroartemisinic acid). It also showed significant binding affinity for the monolignol, coniferyl alcohol. Moreover, Aa547 expression was related inversely to artemisinin content and directly to total lignin content as indicated by its transient silencing and overexpression in A. annua. Artemisinin reduction assay also indicated inverse relationship between Aa547 expression and artemisinin content. Subcellular localization using GFP fusion suggested that Aa547 is peroxisomal. Nevertheless, dual localization (intracellular/extracellular) of Aa547 could not be ruled out due to its effect on both, artemisinin and lignin. Taken together, this indicates possibility of localization-based role diversity for Aa547, which may have implications in artemisinin catabolism as well as lignification in A. annua.
