This review highlights a potential signaling pathway of CO2-dependent stimulation in root hair development. Elevated CO2 firstly increases the carbohydrates production, which triggers the auxin or ethylene responsive signal transduction pathways and subsequently stimulates the generation of intracellular nitric oxide (NO). The NO acts on target Ca2+ and ion channels and induces activation of MAPK. Meanwhile, reactive oxygen species (ROS) activates cytoplasmic Ca2+ channels at the plasma membrane in the apex of the root tip. This complex pathway involves transduction cascades of multiple signals that lead to the fine tuning of epidermal cell initiation and elongation. The results suggest that elevated CO2 plays an important role in cell differentiation processes at the root epidermis.
