Codon usage in chloroplasts is different from that in prokaryotic and eukaryotic nuclear genomes. However, no experimental approach has been made to analyse the translation efficiency of individual codons in chloroplasts. We devised an in vitro assay for translation efficiencies using synthetic mRNAs, and measured the translation efficiencies of five synonymous codon groups in tobacco chloroplasts. Among four alanine codons (GCN, where N is U, C, A or G), GCU was the most efficient for translation, whereas the chloroplast genome lacks tRNA genes corresponding to GCU. Phenylalanine and tyrosine are each encoded by two codons (UUU/C and UAU/C, respectively). Phenylalanine UUC and tyrosine UAC were translated more than twice as efficiently than UUU and UAU, respectively, contrary to their codon usage, whereas translation efficiencies of synonymous codons for alanine, aspartic acid and asparagine were parallel to their codon usage. These observations indicate that translation efficiencies of individual codons are not always correlated with codon usage in vitro in chloroplasts. This raises an important issue for foreign gene expression in chloroplasts.

GCU: !most efficient for translation! tobacco chloroplasts
UUU/C: !translated more efficiently than! UUC
UAU/C: !translated more efficiently than! UAC
codon usage: !not always correlated with! translation efficiency
