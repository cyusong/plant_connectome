Various environmental stresses strongly influence plant development. Among these stresses is drought, which is a serious threat that can reduce agricultural productivity and obstruct plant growth. Although the mechanism of plants in response to drought has been studied extensively, the adaptive strategies of <i>Amygdalus mira</i> (<i>Koehne</i>) Yü et Lu grown in drought and rewatered habitats remain undefined. <i>Amygdalus mira</i> from the Tibetan Plateau has outstanding nutritional and medicinal values and can thrive in extreme drought. In this study, the physiological and proteomic responses in leaves of <i>A. mira</i> were investigated during drought and recovery period. The changes in plant growth, photosynthesis, enzymes, and non-enzymatic antioxidant under drought and rewatering were also analyzed in leaves. Compared with controls, <i>A. mira</i> showed stronger adaptive and resistant characteristics to drought. In addition, the proteomic technique was also used to study drought tolerance mechanisms in <i>A. mira</i> leaves. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using mass spectrometry. Accordingly, 103 proteins involved in 10 functional categories: cytoskeleton dynamics, energy metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, transcription and translation, transport, stress and defense, molecular chaperones, other materials metabolism, and unknown function were identified. These results showed that an increase of stress-defense-related proteins in leaves after drought treatment contributed to coping with drought. Importantly, <i>A. mira</i> developed an adaptive mechanism to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), including enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities and non-enzymatic antioxidant contents, reducing energy, and adjusting the efficiency of gas exchanges. These results may help to understand the acclimation of <i>A. mira</i> to drought.
