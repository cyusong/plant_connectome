Wild barley forms a two-rowed spike with a brittle rachis whereas domesticated barley has two- or six-rowed spikes with a tough rachis. Like domesticated barley, 'agriocrithon' forms a six-rowed spike; however, the spike is brittle as in wild barley, which makes the origin of agriocrithon obscure. Haplotype analysis of the Six-rowed spike 1 (vrs1) and Non-brittle rachis 1 (btr1) and 2 (btr2) genes was conducted to infer the origin of agriocrithon barley. Some agriocrithon barley accessions (eu-agriocrithon) carried Btr1 and Btr2 haplotypes that are not found in any cultivars, implying that they are directly derived from wild barley through a mutation at the vrs1 locus. Other agriocrithon barley accessions (pseudo-agriocrithon) carried Btr1 or Btr2 from cultivated barley, thus implying that they originated from hybridization between six-rowed landraces carrying btr1Btr2 and Btr1btr2 genotypes followed by recombination to produce Btr1Btr2. All materials we collected from Tibet belong to pseudo-agriocrithon and thus do not support the Tibetan Plateau as being a center of barley domestication. Tracing the evolutionary history of these allelic variants revealed that eu-agriocrithon represents six-rowed barley lineages that were selected by early farmers, once in south-eastern Turkmenistan (vrs1.a1) and again in the eastern part of Uzbekistan (vrs1.a4).
