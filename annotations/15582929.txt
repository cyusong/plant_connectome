Mechanical wounding, infiltration with P. syringae or A. tumefaciens, and exposure to an H(2)O(2)-generating system (Glc/Glc oxidase) induce betacyanin synthesis in red beet (Beta vulgaris) leaves. These conditions also induced the expression of BvGT, a gene encoding a glucosyltransferase (GT) from Beta vulgaris. BvGT has a high similarity to Dorotheanthus bellidiformis betanidin-5 GT involved in betacyanin synthesis. Furthermore, the transient expression of a BvGT antisense construct resulted in the reduction of BvGT transcript accumulation and betanin synthesis, suggesting a role for this gene product in betacyanin glucosylation. In addition, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), inhibited the accumulation of the BvGT transcript in response to infiltration with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Hence, this result suggests that ROS produced by a plasma membrane NADPH oxidase may act as a signal to induce BvGT expression, necessary for betanin synthesis after wounding and bacterial infiltration.
