Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient that limits plant growth in many ecosystems. Here we investigate an overlooked component of the terrestrial N cycle - subsurface ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub> ) gas transport and its contribution to plant and mycorrhizal N acquisition. We used controlled mesocosms, soil incubations, stable isotopes, and imaging to investigate edaphic drivers of NH<sub>3</sub> gas efflux, track lateral subsurface N transport originating from <sup>15</sup> NH<sub>3</sub> gas or <sup>15</sup> N-enriched organic matter, and assess plant and mycorrhizal N assimilation from this gaseous transport pathway. NH<sub>3</sub> is released from soil organic matter, travels belowground, and contributes to root and fungal N content. Abiotic soil properties (pH and texture) influence the quantity of NH<sub>3</sub> available for subsurface transport. Mutualisms with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can substantially increase plant NH<sub>3</sub> -N uptake. The grass Brachypodium distachyon acquired 6-9% of total plant N from organic matter-N that traveled as a gas belowground. Colonization by the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis was associated with a two-fold increase in total plant N acquisition from subsurface NH<sub>3</sub> gas. NH<sub>3</sub> gas transport and uptake pathways may be fundamentally different from those of more commonly studied soil N species and warrant further research.
