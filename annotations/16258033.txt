Our understanding of how cell cycle regulation and virulence are coordinated during the induction of fungal pathogenesis is limited. In the maize smut fungus Ustilago maydis, pathogenesis and sexual development are intricately interconnected. Furthermore, the first step in the infection process is mating, and this is linked to the cell cycle. In this study, we have identified a new G1 cyclin gene from U. maydis that we have named cln1. We investigated the roles of Cln1 in growth and differentiation in U. maydis and found that although not essential for growth, its absence produces dramatic morphological defects. We provide results that are consistent with Cln1 playing a conserved role in regulating the length of G1 and cell size, but also additional morphological functions. We also present experiments indicating that the cyclin Cln1 controls sexual development in U. maydis. Overexpression of cln1 blocks sexual development, while its absence enables the cell to express sexual determinants in conditions where wild-type cells were unable to initiate this developmental program. We conclude that Cln1 contributes to negative regulation of the timing of sexual development, and we propose the existence of a negative crosstalk between mating program and vegetative growth that may help explain why these two developmental options are incompatible in U. maydis.
