Promoter editing represents an innovative approach to introduce quantitative trait variation (QTV) in crops. However, an efficient promoter editing system for QTV needs to be established. Here we develop a CRISPR-Cas12a promoter editing (CAPE) system that combines a promoter key-region estimating model and an efficient CRISPR-Cas12a-based multiplexed or singular editing system. CAPE is benchmarked in rice to produce QTV continuums for grain starch content and size by targeting OsGBSS1 and OsGS3, respectively. We then apply CAPE for promoter editing of OsD18, a gene encoding GA3ox in the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway. The resulting lines carry a QTV continuum of semidwarfism without significantly compromising grain measures. Field trials demonstrated that the OsD18 promoter editing lines have the same yield performance and antilodging phenotype as the Green Revolution OsSD1 mutants in different genetic backgrounds. Hence, promoter editing of OsD18 generates a quantitative Green Revolution trait. Together, we demonstrate a CAPE-based promoter editing and tuning pipeline for efficient production of useful QTV continuum in crops.
