['27058316', 'Programmed cell death (PCD) is used by plants for development and survival to  biotic and abiotic stresses. The role of caspases in PCD is well established in  animal cells. Over the past 15 years, the importance of caspase-3-like enzymatic  activity for plant PCD completion has been widely documented despite the absence  of caspase orthologues. In particular, caspase-3 inhibitors blocked nearly all  plant PCD tested. Here, we affinity-purified a plant caspase-3-like activity  using a biotin-labelled caspase-3 inhibitor and identified Arabidopsis thaliana  cathepsin B3 (AtCathB3) by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS). Consistent with this, recombinant AtCathB3 was found to have  caspase-3-like activity and to be inhibited by caspase-3 inhibitors. AtCathepsin  B triple-mutant lines showed reduced caspase-3-like enzymatic activity and  reduced labelling with activity-based caspase-3 probes. Importantly, AtCathepsin  B triple mutants showed a strong reduction in the PCD induced by ultraviolet  (UV), oxidative stress (H2O2, methyl viologen) or endoplasmic reticulum stress.  Our observations contribute to explain why caspase-3 inhibitors inhibit plant PCD  and provide new tools to further plant PCD research. The fact that cathepsin B  does regulate PCD in both animal and plant cells suggests that this protease may  be part of an ancestral PCD pathway pre-existing the plant/animal divergence that  needs further characterisation.', '2016 Sep 1', 'Cell Death Differ', '10.1038/cdd.2016.34', 'ORCID:']
