['23686420', 'There has been considerable interest recently in the prospect of engineering  crops to produce triacylglycerol (TAG) in their vegetative tissues as a means to  achieve a step change in oil yield. Here, we show that disruption of TAG  hydrolysis in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) lipase mutant  sugar-dependent1 (sdp1) leads to a substantial accumulation of TAG in roots and  stems but comparatively much lower TAG accumulation in leaves. TAG content in  sdp1 roots increases with the age of the plant and can reach more than 1% of dry  weight at maturity, a 50-fold increase over the wild type. TAG accumulation in  sdp1 roots requires both ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (DGAT1)  and PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 and can also be strongly  stimulated by the provision of exogenous sugar. In transgenic plants  constitutively coexpressing WRINKLED1 and DGAT1, sdp1 also doubles the  accumulation of TAG in roots, stems, and leaves, with levels ranging from 5% to  8% of dry weight. Finally, provision of 3% (w/v) exogenous Suc can further boost  root TAG content in these transgenic plants to 17% of dry weight. This level of  TAG is similar to seed tissues in many plant species and establishes the efficacy  of an engineering strategy to produce oil in vegetative tissues that involves  simultaneous manipulation of carbohydrate supply, fatty acid synthesis, TAG  synthesis, and also TAG breakdown.', '2013 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.219840', 'Eastmond']
