As major component in cereals grains, starch has been one of the most important carbohydrate consumed by a majority of world's population. However, the molecular mechanism for regulation of biosynthesis of starch remains elusive. In the present study, <i>ZmES22</i>, encoding a MADS-type transcription factor, was modestly characterized from maize inbred line B73. <i>ZmES22</i> exhibited high expression level in endosperm at 10 days after pollination (DAP) and peaked in endosperm at 20 DAP, indicating that <i>ZmES22</i> was preferentially expressed in maize endosperm during active starch synthesis. Transient expression of <i>ZmES22</i> in tobacco leaf revealed that ZmES22 protein located in nucleus. No transactivation activity could be detected for ZmES22 protein via yeast one-hybrid assay. Transformation of overexpressing plasmid 35S::<i>ZmES22</i> into rice remarkedly reduced 1000-grain weight as well as the total starch content, while the soluble sugar was significantly higher in transgenic rice lines. Moreover, overexpressing <i>ZmES22</i> reduced fractions of long branched starch. Scanning electron microscopy images of transverse sections of rice grains revealed that altered expression of <i>ZmES22</i> also changed the morphology of starch granule from densely packed, polyhedral starch granules into loosely packed, spherical granules with larger spaces. Furthermore, RNA-seq results indicated that overexpressing <i>ZmES22</i> could significantly influence mRNA expression levels of numerous key regulatory genes in starch synthesis pathway. Y1H assay illustrated that ZmES22 protein could bind to the promoter region of <i>OsGIF1</i> and downregulate its mRNA expression during rice grain filling stages. These findings suggest that <i>ZmES22</i> was a novel regulator during starch synthesis process in rice endosperm.
