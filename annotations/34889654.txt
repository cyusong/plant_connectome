Before the end of the century, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are predicted to increase to approximately 900 ppm. This will dramatically affect plant physiology and influence environmental interactions and, in particular, plant resistance to biotic stresses. This review is a broad survey of the current research on the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>) on phytohormone-mediated resistance of C<sub>3</sub> agricultural crops and related model species to pathogens and insect herbivores. In general, while plants grown in eCO<sub>2</sub> often have increased constitutive and induced salicylic acid levels and suppressed induced jasmonate levels, there are exceptions that implicate other environmental factors, such as light and nitrogen fertilization in modulating these responses. Therefore, this review sets the stage for future studies to delve into understanding the mechanistic basis behind how eCO<sub>2</sub> will affect plant defensive phytohormone signaling pathways under future predicted environmental conditions that could threaten global food security to inform the best agricultural management practices.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
