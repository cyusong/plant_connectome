My career in research has flourished through hard work, supportive mentors, and outstanding mentees and collaborators. The Carman laboratory has contributed to the understanding of lipid metabolism through the isolation and characterization of key lipid biosynthetic enzymes as well as through the identification of the enzyme-encoding genes. Our findings from yeast have proven to be invaluable to understand regulatory mechanisms of human lipid metabolism. Several rewarding aspects of my career have been my service to the Journal of Biological Chemistry as an editorial board member and Associate Editor, the National Institutes of Health as a member of study sections, and national and international scientific meetings as an organizer. I advise early career scientists to not assume anything, acknowledge others' accomplishments, and pay it forward.
