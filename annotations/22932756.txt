['22932756', 'Triacylglycerols (TAG) in seeds of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and many  plant species contain large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). These  PUFA are synthesized on the membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC). However, the  exact mechanisms of how fatty acids enter PC and how they are removed from PC  after being modified to participate in the TAG assembly are unclear, nor are the  identities of the key enzymes/genes that control these fluxes known. By reverse  genetics and metabolic labeling experiments, we demonstrate that two genes  encoding the lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases LPCAT1 and LPCAT2 in  Arabidopsis control the previously identified "acyl-editing" process, the main  entry of fatty acids into PC. The lpcat1/lpcat2 mutant showed increased contents  of very-long-chain fatty acids and decreased PUFA in TAG and the accumulation of  small amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine in developing seeds revealed by  [(1)(4)C]acetate-labeling experiments. We also showed that mutations in LPCATs and  the PC diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase in the reduced oleate  desaturation1 (rod1)/lpcat1/lpcat2 mutant resulted in a drastic reduction of PUFA  content in seed TAG, accumulating only one-third of the wild-type level. These  results indicate that PC acyl editing and phosphocholine headgroup exchange  between PC and diacylglycerols control the majority of acyl fluxes through PC to  provide PUFA for TAG synthesis.', '2012 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.204438', 'Lu']
