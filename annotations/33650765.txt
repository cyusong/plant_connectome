The tremendous functional, spatial, and temporal diversity of the plant proteome is regulated by multiple factors that continuously modify protein abundance, modifications, interactions, localization, and activity to meet the dynamic needs of plants. Dissecting the proteome complexity and its underlying genetic variation is attracting increasing research attention. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become a powerful approach in the global study of protein functions and their relationships on a systems level. Here, we review recent breakthroughs and strategies adopted to unravel the diversity of the proteome, with a specific focus on the methods used to analyze posttranslational modifications (PTMs), protein localization, and the organization of proteins into functional modules. We also consider PTM crosstalk and multiple PTMs temporally regulating the life cycle of proteins. Finally, we discuss recent quantitative studies using MS to measure protein turnover rates and examine future directions in the study of the plant proteome.
