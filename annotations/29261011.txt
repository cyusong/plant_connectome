The phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 has a complex Gac-rsm global regulatory pathway that controls virulence, motility, production of secondary metabolites, carbon metabolism, and quorum sensing. However, despite the fact that components of this pathway are known, their physiological roles have not yet been established. Regarding the CsrA/RsmA type proteins, five paralogs, three of which are well conserved within the Pseudomonas genus (csrA1, csrA2, and csrA3), have been found in the DC3000 genome. To decipher their function, mutants lacking the three most conserved CsrA proteins have been constructed and their physiological outcomes examined. We show that they exert nonredundant functions and demonstrate that CsrA3 and, to a lesser extent, CsrA2 but not CsrA1 alter the expression of genes involved in a variety of pathways and systems important for motility, exopolysaccharide synthesis, growth, and virulence. Particularly, alginate synthesis, syringafactin production, and virulence are considerably de-repressed in a csrA3 mutant, whereas growth in planta is impaired. We propose that the linkage of growth and symptom development is under the control of CsrA3, which functions as a pivotal regulator of the DC3000 life cycle, repressing virulence traits and promoting cell division in response to environmental cues.
