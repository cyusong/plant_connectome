['10859166', 'In flowering plants, the developing embryo consists of growing populations of  cells whose fates are determined in a position-dependent manner to form the adult  organism. Mutations in the FACKEL (FK) gene affect body organization of the  Arabidopsis seedling. We report that FK is required for cell division and  expansion and is involved in proper organization of the embryo. We isolated FK by  positional cloning. Expression analysis in embryos revealed that FK mRNA becomes  localized to meristematic zones. FK encodes a predicted integral membrane protein  related to the vertebrate lamin B receptor and sterol reductases across species,  including yeast sterol C-14 reductase ERG24. We provide functional evidence that  FK encodes a sterol C-14 reductase by complementation of erg24. GC/MS analysis  confirmed that fk mutations lead to accumulation of intermediates in the  biosynthetic pathway preceding the C-14 reductase step. Although fk represents a  sterol biosynthetic mutant, the phenotype was not rescued by feeding with  brassinosteroids (BRs), the only plant sterol signaling molecules known so far.  We propose that synthesis of sterol signals in addition to BRs is important in  mediating regulated cell growth and organization during embryonic development.  Our results indicate a novel role for sterols in the embryogenesis of plants.', '2000 Jun 15', 'Genes Dev', None, 'Jurgens']
