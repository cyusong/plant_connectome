Metacaspases (MCs), a class of cysteine-dependent proteases, act as important regulators in plant defense response. In maize genome, there are 11 <i>ZmMCs</i> which have been categorized into two types (type I and II) based on their structural differences. In this study, we investigated the different transcript patterns of 11 <i>ZmMCs</i> in maize defense response mediated by the nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich-repeat protein Rp1-D21. We further predicted that many <i>cis</i>-elements responsive to salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin were identified in the promoter regions of <i>ZmMCs</i>, and several different transcription factors were predicted to bind to their promoters. We analyzed the localization of <i>ZmMCs</i> with previously identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in maize disease resistance, and found that all other <i>ZmMCs</i>, except for <i>ZmMC6-8</i>, are co-located with at least one QTL associated with disease resistance to southern leaf blight, northern leaf blight, gray leaf spot or <i>Fusarium</i> ear rot. Based on previous RNA-seq analysis, different <i>ZmMCs</i> display different transcript levels in response to <i>Cochliobolous heterostrophus</i> and <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i>. All the results imply that the members of <i>ZmMCs</i> might have differential functions to different maize diseases. This study lays the basis for further investigating the roles of <i>ZmMCs</i> in maize disease resistance.
