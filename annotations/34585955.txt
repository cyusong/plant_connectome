<i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> is a bacterial pathogen that causes crown gall disease on a wide range of eudicot plants by genetic transformation. Besides T-DNA integrated by natural transformation of plant vegetative tissues by pathogenic <i>Agrobacterium</i> spp., previous reports have indicated that T-DNA sequences originating from an ancestral <i>Agrobacterium</i> sp. are present in the genomes of all cultivated sweet potato (<i>Ipomoea batatas</i>) varieties analyzed. Expression of an <i>Agrobacterium</i>-derived agrocinopine synthase (ACS) gene was detected in leaf and root tissues of sweet potato, suggesting that the plant can produce agrocinopine, a sugar-phosphodiester opine considered to be utilized by some strains of <i>Agrobacterium</i> spp. in crown gall. To validate the product synthesized by <i>Ipomoea batatas</i> ACS (IbACS), we introduced <i>IbACS</i> into tobacco under a constitutive promoter. High-voltage paper electrophoresis followed by alkaline silver nitrate staining detected the production of an agrocinopine-like substance in <i>IbACS1</i>-expressing tobacco, and further mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of the product confirmed that IbACS can produce agrocinopine A from natural plant substrates. The partially purified compound was biologically active in an agrocinopine A bioassay. A 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing and meta-transcriptome analysis revealed that the rhizosphere microbial community of tobacco was affected by the expression of <i>IbACS</i>. A new species of <i>Leifsonia</i> (actinobacteria) was isolated as an enriched bacterium in the rhizosphere of <i>IbACS1</i>-expressing tobacco. This <i>Leifsonia</i> sp. can catabolize agrocinopine A produced in tobacco, indicating that the production of agrocinopine A attracts rhizosphere bacteria that can utilize this sugar-phosphodiester. These results suggest a potential role of <i>IbACS</i> conserved among sweet potato cultivars in manipulating their microbial community.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
