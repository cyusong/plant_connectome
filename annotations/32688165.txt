Calcium (Ca) is an essential element for all organisms. In animal cells, the plasma membrane-localized Ca receptor CaSR coupled to a phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent signaling cascade monitors extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>) and responds with increases in cytosolic calcium concentrations ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>). Plant roots encounter variable soil conditions, but how they sense changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> evokes a transient increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the cytosol, mitochondria, and nuclei of Arabidopsis thaliana root cells. These increases were strongly desensitized to repeat applications of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>, a typical feature of receptor-mediated cellular signaling in animal and plant cells. Treatment with gadolinium (Gd<sup>3+</sup>), a CaSR activator in animal cells, induced concentration-dependent increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> in roots, which showed self-desensitization and cross-desensitization to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (EICC). EICC was sensitive to extracellular H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels. Treatment with the PLC inhibitor neomycin suppressed EICC and Ca accumulation in roots. The inhibitory effect of neomycin on root elongation was fully rescued by increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> but not [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] or [K<sup>+</sup>] in the growth medium. These results suggest that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub> and the movement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol of plant roots are regulated by a receptor-mediated signaling pathway involving PLC.
