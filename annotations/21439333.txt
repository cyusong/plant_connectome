['21439333', 'Both enantiomers of beta-nitro alcohols are versatile chiral building blocks.  However, their synthesis using enzymes as catalysts has received little  attention, with the exception of (S)-beta-nitro alcohols produced in a reaction  catalyzed by an S-selective hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) from Hevea brasiliensis  (HbHNL). An R-selective HNL containing an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold from the  noncyanogenic plant Arabidopsis thaliana (AtHNL) accepts nitromethane (MeNO(2)) as  a donor in a reaction with aromatic aldehydes to yield (R)-beta-nitro alcohols  (Henry reaction; nitro aldol reaction). This reaction proceeded in an  aqueous-organic biphasic system. The organic solvent giving the highest  enantioselectivity was n-butyl acetate (AcOBu) with an optimum aqueous phase  content of 50% (v/v). This is the first example of the R-HNL-catalyzed synthesis  of (R)-beta-nitro alcohols.', '2011 May 20', 'J Biotechnol', '10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.03.011', 'Asano']
