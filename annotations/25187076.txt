Whole-genome re-sequencing of weedy rice from southern China reveals that weedy rice can originate from hybridization of domesticated indica and japonica rice. Weedy rice (Oryza sativa f. spontanea Rosh.), which harbors phenotypes of both wild and domesticated rice, has become one of the most notorious weeds in rice fields worldwide. While its formation is poorly understood, massive amounts of rice genomic data may provide new insights into this issue. In this study, we determined genomes of three weedy rice samples from the lower Yangtze region, China, and investigated their phylogenetics, population structure and chromosomal admixture patterns. The phylogenetic tree and principle component analysis based on 46,005 SNPs with 126 other Oryza accessions suggested that the three weedy rice accessions were intermediate between japonica and indica rice. An ancestry inference study further demonstrated that weedy rice had two dominant genomic components (temperate japonica and indica). This strongly suggests that weedy rice originated from indica-japonica hybridization. Furthermore, 22,443 novel fixed single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the weedy genomes and could have been generated after indica-japonica hybridization for environmental adaptation.
