Wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) ABA insensitive five (<i>ABI5</i>) binding protein gene (<i>TaAFP</i>) is a homologue of the <i>ABI5</i> binding protein (AFP) gene in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. It is well documented that <i>AtAFP</i> is a negative regulator of ABA signaling that regulates embryo germination and seed dormancy. <i>TaABI5</i> was earlier shown to be expressed specifically in seed and its transcript accumulated during wheat grain maturation and acquisition of dormancy. It plays an important role in seed dormancy. In a previous study, we identified two allelic variants <i>TaAFP-B1a</i> and <i>TaAFP-B1b</i> of <i>TaAFP</i> on chromosome arm 2BS in common wheat, designated as, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed a 4 bp insertion in the promoter of <i>TaAFP-B1a</i> compared with <i>TaAFP-B1b</i> that affected mRNA transcription level, mRNA stability, GUS and tdTomatoER translation level, and GUS activity determining seed dormancy. The transcription and translation levels of <i>TaAFP-B</i> were significantly reduced in <i>TaAFP-Ba</i> and <i>TaAFP-Ba-GFP</i> transgenic plants compared with <i>TaAFP-Bb</i> and <i>TaAFP-Bb-GFP</i>. The average GI (germination index) values of <i>TaAFP-Ba</i> and <i>TaAFP-Ba-GFP</i> were significantly lower than those of <i>TaAFP-Bb</i> and <i>TaAFP-Bb-GFP</i> in T1 and T2 transgenic rice seeds, whereas mature <i>TaAFP-Ba</i> and <i>TaAFP-Ba-GFP</i> transgenic seeds exhibited increased ABA sensitivity and content of endogenous ABA compared with <i>TaAFP-Bb</i> and <i>TaAFP-Bb-GFP</i>. The 4 bp insertion in the promoter of <i>TaAFP-Ba</i> decreased transcript abundance and translation level in transgenic rice. This insertion increased sensitivity to ABA and content of endogenous ABA in mature seeds, leading to a higher seed dormancy and pre-harvest sprouting tolerance in transgenic rice.
