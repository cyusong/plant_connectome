['31722406', 'Primary carbohydrate metabolism in plants includes several sugar and  sugar-derivative transport processes. Over recent years, evidences have shown  that in starch-related transport processes, in addition to glucose 6-phosphate,  maltose, glucose and triose-phosphates, glucose 1-phosphate also plays a role and  thereby increases the possible fluxes of sugar metabolites in planta. In this  study, we report the characterization of two highly similar transporters,  At1g34020 and At4g09810, in Arabidopsis thaliana, which allow the import of  glucose 1-phosphate through the plasma membrane. Both transporters were expressed  in yeast and were biochemically analyzed to reveal an antiport of glucose  1-phosphate/phosphate. Furthermore, we showed that the apoplast of Arabidopsis  leaves contained glucose 1-phosphate and that the corresponding mutant of these  transporters had higher glucose 1-phosphate amounts in the apoplast and  alterations in starch and starch-related metabolism.', '2020 Feb 1', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcz206', 'Fettke']
