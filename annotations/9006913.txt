['9006913', "Siroheme, the prosthetic group for both nitrite and sulfite reductases, is a  methylated, iron-containing modified tetrapyrrole. Here we report the first  molecular characterization of the branch point enzyme in higher plants, which  directs intermediates toward siroheme synthesis. A cDNA was cloned from  Arabidopsis thaliana (UPM1) that functionally complements an Escherichia coli  cysG mutant, a strain that is unable to catalyze the conversion of  uroporphyrinogen III (Uro'gen-III) to siroheme. UPM1 is 1484 base pairs and  encodes a 369-amino acid, 39.9-kDa protein. The UPM1 product contains two regions  that are identical to consensus sequences found in bacterial Uro'gen-III and  precorrin methyltransferases. Recombinant UPM1 protein was found to catalyze  S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent transmethylation by UPM1 in a multistep process  involving the formation of a covalently linked complex with  S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The UPM1 product has a sequence at the amino terminus  that resembles a transit peptide for localization to mitochondria or plastids.  The protein produced by in vitro expression is able to enter isolated intact  chloroplasts but not mitochondria. Genomic blot analysis showed that UPM1 is  encoded in the A. thaliana genome. The genomic DNA corresponding to UPM1 was  cloned and sequenced and found to contain at least five introns.", '1997 Jan 31', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.272.5.2744', 'Warren']
