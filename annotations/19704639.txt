Image-based non-destructive methods were used to quantify root growth reactions happening within hours following simulated leaf herbivore attack.1 The induction of wound reactions in leaves of seedlings of Nicotiana attenuata led to transiently decreased root growth rates: Upon application of the oral secretions and regurgitants of the specialist herbivore Manduca sexta, a transient decrease in root growth was observed that was more pronounced than if a mere mechanical wounding was imposed. Root growth reduction was more severe than leaf growth reduction and the timing of the transient growth reduction coincided with endogenous bursts of jasmonate (JA) and ethylene emissions reported in literature. The reaction of root growth was superimposed by a strong diel variation of root growth, which was caused by the fluctuating temperature to which the plants were exposed. Apart from the observed root growth reaction, other defense-related traits such as increased nicotine concentration, trichome length and density were activated within 72 h after wounding. Further experiments indicated that the response was elicited by fatty acid-amino acid conjugates that are contained in the oral secretions and that JA signalling is crucial for root-shoot communication here.

Wounding: !induces! JA/ethylene emissions
JA signalling: !mediates! root-shoot communication
Oral secretions: !contain! fatty acid-amino acid conjugates
Herbivore attack: !causes! transient decrease in root growth
Temperature: !influences! diel variation of root growth
Nicotine concentration: !increases! after wounding
Trichome length/density: !enhances! after wounding
