StLFY-knockout potato plants were developed using CRISPR/Cas9 system. Inflorescences of edited plants transited to flowering, but inflorescence structures lacked flowers and were indeterminate, producing multiple shoot meristems. The tetraploid potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is an important agricultural crop worldwide. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to inactivate the potato homolog (StLFY) of the LEAFY gene-a key regulator of the transition to flowering and floral meristem identity-in a tetraploid potato cultivar. We achieved high rates of all-allelic knockouts. Frameshift indels led to phenotypic alterations, including indeterminate inflorescence development and the replacement of flowers with the leafy-like structures.

StLFY: !inactivates! Transition to flowering
CRISPR/Cas9: !edits! Potato homolog
StLFY: !regulates! Floral meristem identity
Frameshift indels: !causes! Phenotypic alterations
Indeterminate inflorescence: !replaces! Flowers with leafy-like structures
