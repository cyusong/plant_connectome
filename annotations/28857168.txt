Plants live in a world where they are challenged by abiotic and biotic stresses. In response to unfavorable conditions or an acute challenge like a pathogen attack, plants use various signaling pathways that regulate expression of defense genes and other mechanisms to provide resistance or stress adaptation. Identification of the regulatory steps in defense signaling has seen much progress in recent years. Many of the identified signaling pathways show interactions with each other, exemplified by the modulation of the jasmonic acid response by salicylic acid. Accordingly, defense regulation is more appropriately thought of as a web of interactions, rather than linear pathways. Here we describe various regulatory components and how they interact to provide an appropriate defense response. One of the common assays to monitor the output of defense signaling, as well as interaction between signaling pathways, is the measurement of altered gene expression. We illustrate that, while this is a suitable assay to monitor defense regulation, it can also inadvertently provide overstated conclusions about interaction among signaling pathways.
