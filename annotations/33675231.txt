Lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) were originally found as symbiotic signals called Nod Factors (Nod-LCOs) controlling the nodulation of legumes by rhizobia. More recently, LCOs were also found in symbiotic fungi and, more surprisingly, very widely in the kingdom Fungi, including in saprophytic and pathogenic fungi. The LCO-V(C18:1, fucosylated/methyl fucosylated), hereafter called Fung-LCOs, are the LCO structures most commonly found in fungi. This raises the question of how legume plants such as Medicago truncatula can discriminate between Nod-LCOs and Fung-LCOs. To address this question, we performed a genome-wide association study on 173 natural accessions of M. truncatula, using a root branching phenotype and a newly developed local score approach. Both Nod-LCOs and Fung-LCOs stimulated root branching in most accessions, but the root responses to these two types of LCO molecules were not correlated. In addition, the heritability of the root response was higher for Nod-LCOs than for Fung-LCOs. We identified 123 loci for Nod-LCO and 71 for Fung-LCO responses, of which only one was common. This suggests that Nod-LCOs and Fung-LCOs both control root branching but use different molecular mechanisms. The tighter genetic constraint of the root response to Fung-LCOs possibly reflects the ancestral origin of the biological activity of these molecules.

Nod-LCOs: !control! nodulation of legumes 
Fung-LCOs: !control! root branching 
Nod-LCOs: !have higher heritability! root response 
Fung-LCOs: !have lower heritability! root response 
Nod-LCOs: !use different molecular mechanisms! Fung-LCOs
