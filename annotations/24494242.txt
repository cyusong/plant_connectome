The exocyst complex is a multi-subunits evolutionary conserved complex, which was originally shown to be primarily associated with vesicular transport to the plasma membrane. A recent report (Kulich et al., 2013 Traffic; In Press) revealed that AtEXO70B1, one of the multiple subunits of the exocyst complex of Arabidopsis thaliana plants, is co-transported with the autophagy-associated Atg8f protein to the vacuole. This pathway does not involve the Golgi apparatus. The co-localization of AtEXO70B1 and Atg8f suggests either that both of these proteins are co-transported together to the vacuole or, alternatively, that Atg8 binds to a putative Atg8 interacting motif (AIM) located within the AtEXO70B1 polypeptide, apparently forming a tethering complex for an autophagic complex that is transported to the vacuole. In the present addendum, by tooling a bioinformatics approach, we show that AtEXO70B1 as well as the additional 20 paralogs of Arabidopsis EXO70 exocyst subunits each possess one or more AIMs whose consensus sequence implies their high fidelity binding to Atg8. This indicates that the autophagy machinery is strongly involved in the assembly, transport, and apparently also the function of AtEXO70B1 as well as the exocyst sub complex.
