['28970334', 'The role of phloem proteins in plant resistance to aphids is still largely  elusive. By genome-wide association mapping of aphid behavior on 350 natural  Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, we identified the small heat shock-like SIEVE  ELEMENT-LINING CHAPERONE1 (SLI1). Detailed behavioral studies on near-isogenic  and knockout lines showed that SLI1 impairs phloem feeding. Depending on the  haplotype, aphids displayed a different duration of salivation in the phloem. On  sli1 mutants, aphids prolonged their feeding sessions and ingested phloem at a  higher rate than on wild-type plants. The largest phenotypic effects were  observed at 26 degrees C, when SLI1 expression is upregulated. At this moderately high  temperature, sli1 mutants suffered from retarded elongation of the inflorescence  and impaired silique development. Fluorescent reporter fusions showed that SLI1  is confined to the margins of sieve elements where it lines the parietal layer  and colocalizes in spherical bodies around mitochondria. This localization  pattern is reminiscent of the clamp-like structures observed in previous  ultrastructural studies of the phloem and shows that the parietal phloem layer  plays an important role in plant resistance to aphids and heat stress.', '2017 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00424', 'Jongsma']
