Tuber formation in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is regulated by hormonal and environmental signals that are thought to be integrated in the leaves. The molecular mechanisms that mediate the responses to tuberization-related signals in leaves remain largely unknown. In this study we analyzed the roles of protein phosphatase type 2A catalytic subunits (PP2Ac) in the leaf responses to conditions that affect tuberization. The responses were monitored by analyzing the expression of the "tuber-specific" genes Patatin and Pin2, which are induced in tubers and leaves during tuber induction. Experiments using PP2A inhibitors, together with PP2Ac expression profiles under conditions that affect tuberization indicate that high sucrose/nitrogen ratio, which promotes tuber formation, increases the transcript levels of Patatin and Pin2, by increasing the activity of PP2As without affecting PP2Ac mRNA or protein levels. Gibberellic acid (GA), a negative regulator of tuberization, down-regulates the transcription of catalytic subunits of PP2As from the subfamily I and decreases their enzyme levels. In addition, GA inhibits the expression of Patatin and Pin2 possibly by a PP2A-independent mechanism. PP2Ac down-regulation by GA may inhibit tuberization signaling downstream of the inductive effects of high sucrose/nitrogen ratio. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PP2As of the subfamily I may positively modulate the signaling pathways that lead to the transcriptional activation of "tuber-specific" genes in leaves, and act as molecular switches regulated by both positive and negative modulators of tuberization.
