The development of the embryo in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) involves a carefully controlled set of cell divisions and cell fate decisions that lead to a mature embryo containing shoot and root meristems and all basic tissue types. Over the last 20 years, a number of transcriptional regulators of embryonic patterning have been described, but little is known about the role of posttranscriptional regulators such as microRNAs (miRNAs). Previous work has centered on the study of null or very weak alleles of miRNA biosynthetic genes, but these mutants either arrest early in embryogenesis or have wild-type-looking embryos. Here, we significantly extend those analyses by characterizing embryos mutant for a strong hypomorphic allele of DICER-LIKE1 (dcl1-15). Our data demonstrate that miRNAs are required for the patterning of most regions of the embryo, with the exception of the protoderm. In mutant embryos with the most severe morphological defects, the majority of tissue identities are lost. Different levels of miRNAs appear to be required to specify cell fates in various regions of the embryo. The suspensor needs the lowest levels, followed by the root apical meristem and hypocotyl, cotyledons, and shoot apical meristem. Furthermore, we show that erecta acts as a suppressor of dcl1-15, a novel role for this signaling pathway in embryos. Our results also indicate that the regulation of the messenger RNA levels of miRNA targets involves not just the action of miRNAs but has a significant transcriptional component as well.
