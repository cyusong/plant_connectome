The stomatal pores of plant leaves, situated in the epidermis and surrounded by a pair of guard cells, allow CO2 uptake for photosynthesis and water loss through transpiration. Blue light is one of the dominant environmental signals that control stomatal movements in leaves of plants in a natural environment. This blue light response is mediated by blue/UV A light-absorbing phototropins (phots) and cryptochromes (crys). Red/far-red light-absorbing phytochromes (phys) also play a role in the control of stomatal aperture. The signaling components that link the perception of light signals to the stomatal opening response are largely unknown. This review discusses a few newly discovered nuclear genes, their function with respect to the phot-, cry-, and phy-mediated signal transduction cascades, and possible involvement of circadian clock.

phot: !mediates! blue/UV A light response
crys: !mediates! blue/UV A light response
phys: !mediates! red/far-red light response
nuclear genes: !link! perception of light signals to stomatal opening response
nuclear genes: !involve! circadian clock
