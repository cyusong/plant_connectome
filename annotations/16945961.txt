['16945961', 'The endonuclease MUS81 has been shown in a variety of organisms to be involved in  DNA repair in mitotic and meiotic cells. Homologues of the MUS81 gene exist in  the genomes of all eukaryotes, pointing to a conserved role of the protein.  However, the biological role of MUS81 varies between different eukaryotes. For  example, while loss of the gene results in strongly impaired fertility in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae and nearly complete sterility in Schizosaccharomyces  pombe, it is not essential for meiosis in mammals. We identified a functional  homologue (AtMUS81/At4g30870) in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana and isolated  a full-length cDNA of this gene. Analysing two independent T-DNA insertion lines  of AtMUS81, we found that they are sensitive to the mutagens MMS and MMC. Both  mutants have a deficiency in homologous recombination in somatic cells but only  after induction by genotoxic stress. In contrast to yeast, no meiotic defect of  AtMUS81 mutants was detectable and the mutants are viable. Crosses with a  hyperrecombinogenic mutant of the AtRecQ4A helicase resulted in synthetic  lethality in the double mutant. Thus, the nuclease AtMUS81 and the helicase  AtRecQ4A seem to be involved in two alternative pathways of resolution of  replicative DNA structures in somatic cells.', '2006', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkl576', 'Puchta']
