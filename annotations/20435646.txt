['20435646', 'In flowering plants, pollen formation is a complex process and strictly  controlled by genetic factors. Although thousands of genes have been identified  to be highly or specifically expressed in pollen grains, little is known about  the functions and regulatory mechanisms of the genes in pollen formation. Here we  report the characterization of a novel gene, MALE GAMETOPHYTE DEFECTIVE 1 (MGP1),  that is essential for pollen formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. MGP1 encodes the  F(A)d subunit of mitochondrial F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase in Arabidopsis. It was  highly expressed in pollen grains at the later developmental stage. Mutation in  MGP1 led to destruction of the mitochondria in pollen grains at the dehydration  stage and subsequently death of the pollen grains. These results suggested that  MGP1 plays important roles in pollen formation, possibly by regulating the  activity of mitochondrial F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase in Arabidopsis pollen grains.', '2010 Jun', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcq066', 'Ye']
