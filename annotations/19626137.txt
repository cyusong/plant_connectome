['19626137', 'Transcriptome analyses have been performed on mature trichomes isolated from  wild-type Arabidopsis leaves and on leaf trichomes isolated from the gl3-sst sim  double mutant, which exhibit many attributes of immature trichomes. The mature  trichome profile contained many highly expressed genes involved in cell wall  synthesis, protein turnover, and abiotic stress response. The most highly  expressed genes in the gl3-sst sim profile encoded ribosomal proteins and other  proteins involved in translation. Comparative analyses showed that all but one of  the genes encoding transcription factors previously found to be important for  trichome formation, and many other trichome-important genes, were preferentially  expressed in gl3-sst sim trichomes. The analysis of genes preferentially  expressed in gl3-sst sim led to the identification of four additional genes  required for normal trichome development. One of these was the HDG2 gene, which  is a member of the HD-ZIP IV transcription factor gene family. Mutations in this  gene did not alter trichome expansion, but did alter mature trichome cell walls.  Mutations in BLT resulted in a loss of trichome branch formation. The  relationship between blt and the phenotypically identical mutant, sti, was  explored. Mutations in PEL3, which was previously shown to be required for  development of the leaf cuticle, resulted in the occasional tangling of expanding  trichomes. Mutations in another gene encoding a protein with an unknown function  altered trichome branch formation.', '2009 Jul', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssp037', 'Dixon']
