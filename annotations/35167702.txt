Plant ribosomes contain four specialized ribonucleic acids, the 5S, 5.8S, 18S, and 25S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Maturation of the latter three rRNAs requires cooperative processing of a single transcript by several endonucleases and exonucleases at specific sites. In maize (Zea mays), the exact nucleases and components required for rRNA processing remain poorly understood. Here, we characterized a conserved RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase (RCL)-like protein, RCL1, that functions in 18S rRNA maturation. RCL1 is highly expressed in the embryo and endosperm during early seed development. Loss of RCL1 function resulted in lethality due to aborted embryo cell differentiation. We also observed pleiotropic defects in the rcl1 endosperm, including abnormal basal transfer cell layer growth and aleurone cell identity, and reduced storage reserve accumulation. The rcl1 seeds had lower levels of mature 18S rRNA and the related precursors were altered in abundance compared with wild type. Analysis of transcript levels and protein accumulation in rcl1 revealed that the observed lower levels of zein and starch synthesis enzymes mainly resulted from effects at the transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. These results demonstrate that RCL1-mediated 18S pre-rRNA processing is essential for ribosome function and messenger RNA translation during maize seed development.
