<i>Bemisia tabaci</i> is a threat to agriculture worldwide because of its potential to cause devastating damage to crops. Chlorogenic acid is a bioactive pesticidal phytochemical agent against various insect pests. We here determined the susceptibility of a laboratory strain of <i>B. tabaci</i> to chlorogenic acid and other popular insecticides, and the susceptibility of several field-collected populations to chlorogenic acid. Also, cross-resistance to four common insecticides was measured. Chlorogenic acid had the highest toxicity of all tested insecticides, and all the field-collected populations were susceptible to chlorogenic acid, and little cross-resistance was detected between chlorogenic acid and the other tested insecticides. Furthermore, analysis of enzyme activities and expression of P450 genes in <i>B. tabaci</i> after treatment with LC<sub>50</sub> of chlorogenic acid suggested that enhanced P450 activity could be involved in chlorogenic acid detoxification. We subsequently evaluated sublethal effects of chlorogenic acid, and found that treatment with LC<sub>25</sub> of chlorogenic acid prolonged duration of two developmental stages, reduced fecundity, and decreased survival rates of treated <i>B. tabaci</i> compared to untreated insects. Overall, these findings demonstrate strong toxicity and significant sublethal effects of chlorogenic acid on <i>B. tabaci</i>, and suggest that overexpression of P450 genes may be associated with chlorogenic acid detoxification.
