Uptake and translocation of micronutrients are essential for plant growth. These micronutrients are also important food components. We generated transgenic rice plants over-expressing OsIRT1 to evaluate its functional roles in metal homeostasis. Those plants showed enhanced tolerance to iron deficiency at the seedling stage. In paddy fields, this over-expression caused plant architecture to be altered. In addition, those plants were sensitive to excess Zn and Cd, indicating that OsIRT1 also transports those metals. As expected, iron and zinc contents were elevated in the shoots, roots and mature seeds of over-expressing plants. This demonstrates that OsIRT1 can be used for enhancing micronutrient levels in rice grains.
