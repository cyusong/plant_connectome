Acetylation and deacetylation of histones are important for regulating a series of biological processes in plants. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) control the histone deacetylation that plays an important role in plant response to abiotic stress. In our study, we show the evidence that GhHDT4D (a member of the HD2 subfamily of HDACs) is involved in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) response to drought stress. Overexpression of GhHDT4D in Arabidopsis increased plant tolerance to drought, whereas silencing GhHDT4D in cotton resulted in plant sensitivity to drought. Simultaneously, the H3K9 acetylation level was altered in the GhHDT4D silenced cotton, compared with the controls. Further study revealed that GhHDT4D suppressed the transcription of GhWRKY33, which plays a negative role in cotton defense to drought, by reducing its H3K9 acetylation level. The expressions of the stress-related genes, such as GhDREB2A, GhDREB2C, GhSOS2, GhRD20-1, GhRD20-2 and GhRD29A, were significantly decreased in the GhHDT4D silenced cotton, but increased in the GhWRKY33 silenced cotton. Given these data together, our findings suggested that GhHDT4D may enhance drought tolerance by suppressing the expression of GhWRKY33, thereby activating the downstream drought response genes in cotton.
