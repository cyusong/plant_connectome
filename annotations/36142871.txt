Flowering is a pivotal developmental process in response to the environment and determines the start of a new life cycle in plants. Woody plants usually possess a long juvenile nonflowering phase followed by an adult phase with repeated flowering cycles. The molecular mechanism underlying flowering regulation in woody plants is believed to be much more complex than that in annual herbs. In this review, we briefly describe the successive but distinct flowering processes in perennial trees, namely the vegetative phase change, the floral transition, floral organogenesis, and final blooming, and summarize in detail the most recent advances in understanding how woody plants regulate flowering through dynamic gene expression. Notably, the florigen gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i>(<i>FT</i>) and its antagonistic gene <i>TERMINAL FLOWER 1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>) seem to play a central role in various flowering transition events. Flower development in different taxa requires interactions between floral homeotic genes together with <i>AGL6</i> conferring floral organ identity. Finally, we illustrate the issues and corresponding measures of flowering regulation investigation. It is of great benefit to the future study of flowering in perennial trees.
