An important branch of plant immunity involves the recognition of pathogens by nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins. However, signaling events downstream of NB-LRR activation are poorly understood. We have analysed the Arabidopsis translatome using ribosome affinity purification and RNA sequencing. Our results show that the translational status of hundreds of transcripts is differentially affected upon activation of the NB-LRR protein RPM1, showing an overall pattern of a switch away from growth-related activities to defense. Among these is the central translational regulator and growth promoter, Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase. Suppression of TOR expression leads to increased resistance to pathogens while overexpression of TOR results in increased susceptibility, indicating an important role for translational control in the switch from growth to defense. Furthermore, we show that several additional genes whose mRNAs are translationally regulated, including BIG, CCT2, and CIPK5, are required for both NB-LRR-mediated and basal plant innate immunity, identifying novel actors in plant defense.
