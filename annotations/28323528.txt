Plant immunity inducers represent a new and rapidly developing field in plant-protection research. In this paper, we discuss recent research on plant immunity inducers and their development and applications in China. Plant immunity inducers include plant immunity-inducing proteins, chitosan oligosaccharides, and microbial inducers. These compounds and microorganisms can trigger defense responses and confer disease resistance in plants. We also describe the mechanisms of plant immunity inducers and how they promote plant health. Furthermore, we summarize the current situation in plant immunity inducer development in China and the global marketplace. Finally, we also deeply analyze the development trends and application prospects of plant immunity inducers in environmental protection and food safety.
