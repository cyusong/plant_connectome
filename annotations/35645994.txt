Salinity stress is one of the major global problems that negatively affect crop growth and productivity. Therefore, ecofriendly and sustainable strategies for mitigating salinity stress in agricultural production and global food security are highly demandable. Sugarcane press mud (PM) is an excellent source of the organic amendment, and the role of PM in mitigating salinity stress is not well understood. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate how the PM mitigates salinity stress through the regulation of rice growth, yield, physiological properties, and antioxidant enzyme activities in fine rice grown under different salinity stress conditions. In this study, different levels of salinity (6 and 12 dS m<sup>-1</sup>) with or without different levels of 3, 6, and 9% of SPM, respectively were tested. Salinity stress significantly increased malondialdehyde (MDA, 38%), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 74.39%), Na<sup>+</sup> (61.5%), electrolyte leakage (40.32%), decreased chlorophyll content (32.64%), leaf water content (107.77%), total soluble protein (TSP, 72.28%), and free amino acids (FAA, 75.27%). However, these negative effects of salinity stress were reversed mainly in rice plants after PM application. PM application (9%) remained the most effective and significantly increased growth, yield, TSP, FAA, accumulation of soluble sugars, proline, K<sup>+</sup>, and activity of antioxidant enzymes, namely, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD). Thus, these findings suggest a PM-mediated eco-friendly strategy for salinity alleviation in agricultural soil could be useful for plant growth and productivity in saline soils.
