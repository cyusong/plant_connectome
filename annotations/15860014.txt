['15860014', 'The Arabidopsis type 1 UDP-glucose-dependent glucosyltransferase UGT72B1 is  highly active in conjugating the persistent pollutants 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA)  and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP). To determine its importance in detoxifying  xenobiotics in planta, mutant plants where the respective gene has been disrupted  by T-DNA insertion have been characterized. Extracts from the knockout ugt72B1  plants showed radically reduced conjugating activity towards DCA and TCP and the  absence of immunodetectable UGT72B1 protein. In contrast, activities towards  phenolic natural products were unaffected. When aseptic root cultures were fed  [14C]-DCA, compared with wild types, the ugt72B1 plants showed a reduced rate of  uptake of the xenobiotic and very little metabolism to soluble DCA-glucose or  associated polar conjugates. Instead, the knockouts accumulated non-extractable  radioactive residues, most probably associated with lignification. When the  feeding studies were carried out with [14C]-TCP, rates and routes of metabolism  were identical in the wild type and knockouts, with TCP-glucoside a major product  in both cases. Similar differential effects on the metabolism of DCA and TCP were  obtained in whole plant studies with wild type and ugt72B1 mutants, demonstrating  that while UGT72B1 had a central role in metabolizing chloroanilines in  Arabidopsis, additional UGTs could compensate for the conjugation of TCP in the  knockout. TCP was equally toxic to wild type and ugt72B1 plants, while  surprisingly, the knockouts were less sensitive to DCA. From this it was  concluded that the glucosylation of DCA may not be as effective in xenobiotic  detoxification as bound-residue formation.', '2005 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02398.x', 'Edwards']
