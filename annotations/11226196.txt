['11226196', 'Nonhost interactions are prevalent between plants and specialized phytopathogens.  Although it has great potential for providing crop plants with durable  resistance, nonhost resistance is poorly understood. Here, we show that nonhost  resistance is controlled, at least in part, by general resistance. Arabidopsis  plants are resistant to the nonhost pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv phaseolicola  NPS3121 and completely arrest bacterial multiplication in the plant. Ten  Arabidopsis mutants were isolated that were compromised in nonhost (nho)  resistance to P. s. phaseolicola. Among these, nho1 is caused by a single  recessive mutation that defines a novel gene. nho1 is defective in nonspecific  resistance to Pseudomonas bacteria, because it also supported the growth of P. s.  tabaci and P. fluorescens bacteria, both of which are nonpathogenic on  Arabidopsis. In addition, the nho1 mutation also compromised resistance mediated  by RPS2, RPS4, RPS5, and RPM1. Interestingly, the nho1 mutation had no effect on  the growth of the virulent bacteria P. s. maculicola ES4326 and P. s. tomato  DC3000, but it partially restored the in planta growth of the DC3000 hrpS(-)  mutant bacteria. Thus, the virulent bacteria appear to evade or suppress  NHO1-mediated resistance by means of an Hrp-dependent virulence mechanism.', '2001 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.13.2.437', 'Zhou']
