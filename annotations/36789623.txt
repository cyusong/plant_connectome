While various labs had shown cell division-inducing activity in a variety of plant extracts for over a decade, the identification of zeatin (Z) in 1964, the first known naturally occurring cytokinin, belongs to Letham and co-workers. Using extracts from maize (Zea mays), they were the first to obtain crystals of pure Z and in sufficient quantity for structural determination by MS, NMR, chromatography, and mixed melting point analysis. This group also crystallised Z-9-riboside (ZR) from coconut (Cocos nucifera) milk. However, their chemical contributions go well beyond the identification of Z and ZR and include two unambiguous syntheses of trans-Z (to establish stereochemistry), the synthesis of 3H-cytokinins that facilitated metabolic studies, and the synthesis of deuterated internal standards for accurate mass spectral quantification. Letham and associates also unequivocally identified Z nucleotide, the 7-and 9-glucoside conjugates of Z, and the O-glucosides of Z, ZR, dihydro Z (DHZ) and DHZR as endogenous compounds and as metabolites of exogenous Z. Their contributions to the role of cytokinins in plant physiology and development were also substantial, especially the role of cytokinins moving in the xylem. These biological advances are described and briefly related to the genetic/molecular biological contributions of others that established that plants have an absolute requirement for cytokinin.
