In the biennial Cichorium intybus, inulin-type fructans accumulate in the taproot during the first year. Upon cold or drought exposure, fructans are degraded by fructan exohydrolases, affecting inulin yield and degree of polymerization. While stress-induced expression of 1-FEH genes has been thoroughly explored, the transcriptional network mediating these responses has remained unknown. In this study, several R2R3-MYB transcriptional regulators were analysed for their possible involvement in 1-FEH regulation via transient transactivation of 1-FEH target promoters and for in vivo co-expression with target genes under different stress and hormone treatments. CiMYB3 and CiMYB5 selectively enhanced promoter activities of 1-FEH1, 1-FEH2a, and 1-FEH2b genes, without affecting promoter activities of fructosyltransferase genes. Both factors recognized the MYB-core motifs (C/TNGTTA/G) that are abundantly present in 1-FEH promoters. In chicory hairy root cultures, CiMYB5 displayed co-expression with its target genes in response to different abiotic stress and phytohormone treatments, whereas correlations with CiMYB3 expression were less consistent. Oligofructan levels indicated that the metabolic response, while depending on the balance of the relative expression levels of fructan exohydrolases and fructosyltransferases, could be also affected by differential subcellular localization of different FEH isoforms. The results indicate that in chicory hairy root cultures CiMYB5 and CiMYB3 act as positive regulators of the fructan degradation pathway.
