YABBY (YAB) genes are specifically expressed in abaxial cells of lateral organs and determine abaxial cell fate. However, most studies have focused on few model plants, and the molecular mechanisms of YAB genes are not well understood. Here, we identified a YAB transcription factor in chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium), Dwarf and Robust Plant (CmDRP), that belongs to a distinct FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FlL)/YAB3 sub-clade lost in Brassicaceae. CmDRP was expressed in various tissues but did not show any polar distribution in chrysanthemum. Overexpression of CmDRP resulted in a semi-dwarf phenotype with a significantly decreased active GA3 content, while reduced expression generated the opposite phenotype. Furthermore, plant height of transgenic plants was partially rescued through the exogenous application of GA3 and Paclobutrazol, and expression of the GA biosynthesis gene CmGA3ox1 was significantly altered in transgenic plants. Yeast one-hybrid, luciferase, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR analyses showed that CmDRP could directly bind to the CmGA3ox1 promoter and suppress its expression. Our research reveals a nonpolar expression pattern of a YAB family gene in dicots and demonstrates it regulates plant height through the GA pathway, which will deepen the understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of YAB genes.
