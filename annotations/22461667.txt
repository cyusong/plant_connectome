['22461667', 'Application of crab shell chitin or pentamer chitin oligosaccharide to  Arabidopsis seedlings increased tolerance to salinity in wild-type but not in  knockout mutants of the LysM Receptor-Like Kinase1 (CERK1/LysM RLK1) gene, known  to play a critical role in signaling defense responses induced by exogenous  chitin. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the endochitinase chit36 and  hexoaminidase excy1 genes from the fungus Trichoderma asperelleoides T203 showed  increased tolerance to salinity, heavy-metal stresses, and Botrytis cinerea  infection. Resistant lines, overexpressing fungal chitinases at different levels,  were outcrossed to lysm rlk1 mutants. Independent homozygous hybrids lost  resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, despite enhanced chitinase activity.  Expression analysis of 270 stress-related genes, including those induced by  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chitin, revealed constant up-regulation (at  least twofold) of 10 genes in the chitinase-overexpressing line and an additional  76 salt-induced genes whose expression was not elevated in the lysm rlk1 knockout  mutant or the hybrids harboring the mutation. These findings elucidate that  chitin-induced signaling mediated by LysM RLK1 receptor is not limited to biotic  stress response but also encompasses abiotic-stress signaling and can be conveyed  by ectopic expression of chitinases in plants.', '2012 Sep', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/sss021', 'Viterbo']
