Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded rice plants is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward growth direction is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward growth).
