Phytotoxic aluminum (Al) is a limiting factor for crop production on acid soils. The molecular mechanism, however, underlying Al toxicity and responses in plants is still not well understood. We report here the characterization of comparative proteome of aluminum-stress-responsive proteins in a known Al-resistant soybean cultivar, Baxi 10 (BX10). To investigate time-dependent responses, 1-week-old soybean seedlings were exposed to 50 microM AlCl3 for 24, 48 and 72 h, and total proteins extracted from roots were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. More than 1200 root proteins of the soybean BX10 seedling were reproducibly resolved on the gels. A total of 39 differentially expressed spots in abundance were identified by mass spectrometry, with 21 upregulated, 13 newly induced and 5 downregulated. The heat shock protein, glutathione S-transferase, chalcone-related synthetase, GTP-binding protein and ABC transporter ATP-binding protein were previously detected at the transcriptional or translational level in other plants. Other proteins, identified in this study, are new Al-induced proteins. Soybean BX10 roots under aluminum stress could be characterized by the cellular activities involved in stress/defense, signal transduction, transport, protein folding, gene regulation, and primary metabolisms, which are critical for plant survival under Al toxicity. This present study expands our understanding of differentially expressed proteins associated with aluminum stress on soybean BX10.
