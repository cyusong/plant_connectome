Gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) has been widely studied in flowering plants, but studies of the mechanisms underlying pollen tube growth arrest by self S-RNase in GSI species are limited. In the present study, two leucine-rich repeat extensin genes in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri), PbLRXA2.1 and PbLRXA2.2, were identified based on transcriptome and quantitative real-time PCR analyses. The expression levels of these two LRX genes were significantly higher in the pollen grains and pollen tubes of the self-compatible cultivar 'Jinzhui' (harboring a spontaneous bud mutation) than in those of the self-incompatible cultivar 'Yali'. Both PbLRXA2.1 and PbLRXA2.2 stimulated pollen tube growth and attenuated the inhibitory effects of self S-RNase on pollen tube growth by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton and enhancing cell wall integrity. These results indicate that abnormal expression of PbLRXA2.1 and PbLRXA2.2 is involved in the loss of self-incompatibility in 'Jinzhui'. The PbLRXA2.1 and PbLRXA2.2 promoters were directly bound by the ABRE-binding factor PbABF.D.2. Knockdown of PbABF.D.2 decreased PbLRXA2.1 and PbLRXA2.2 expression and inhibited pollen tube growth. Notably, the expression of PbLRXA2.1, PbLRXA2.2, and PbABF.D.2 was repressed by self S-RNase, suggesting that self S-RNase can arrest pollen tube growth by restricting the PbABF.D.2-PbLRXA2.1/PbLRXA2.2 signal cascade. These results provide novel insight into pollen tube growth arrest by self S-RNase.
