['15888445', '5-Formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF) is formed via a second catalytic activity of  serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) and strongly inhibits SHMT and other  folate-dependent enzymes in vitro. The only enzyme known to metabolize 5-CHO-THF  is 5-CHO-THF cycloligase (5-FCL), which catalyzes its conversion to  5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. Because 5-FCL is mitochondrial in plants and  mitochondrial SHMT is central to photorespiration, we examined the impact of an  insertional mutation in the Arabidopsis 5-FCL gene (At5g13050) under  photorespiratory (30 and 370 micromol of CO2 mol(-1)) and non-photorespiratory  (3200 micromol of CO2 mol(-1)) conditions. The mutation had only mild visible  effects at 370 micromol of CO2 mol(-1), reducing growth rate by approximately 20%  and delaying flowering by 1 week. However, the mutation doubled leaf 5-CHO-THF  level under all conditions and, under photorespiratory conditions, quadrupled the  pool of 10-formyl-/5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolates (which could not be  distinguished analytically). At 370 micromol of CO2 mol(-1), the mitochondrial  5-CHO-THF pool was 8-fold larger in the mutant and contained most of the  5-CHO-THF in the leaf. In contrast, the buildup of  10-formyl-/5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolates was extramitochondrial. In  photorespiratory conditions, leaf glycine levels were up to 46-fold higher in the  mutant than in the wild type. Furthermore, when leaves were supplied with  5-CHO-THF, glycine accumulated in both wild type and mutant. These data establish  that 5-CHO-THF can inhibit SHMT in vivo and thereby influence glycine pool size.  However, the near-normal growth of the mutant shows that even exceptionally high  5-CHO-THF levels do not much affect fluxes through SHMT or any other  folate-dependent reaction, i.e. that 5-CHO-THF is well tolerated in plants.', '2005 Jul 15', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M503106200', 'Hanson']
