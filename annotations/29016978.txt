Taxus species are well-known for paclitaxel, which exhibits antitumor activities and is used for treating various cancers. Although most Taxus species are widespread in many areas, few studies have characterized the variation in metabolism among different Taxus species. Using an integrated approach involving 'tandem mass tag' labeling and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), proteomes of T. media and T. mairei were investigated and 4078 proteins were quantified. Screening and classification of differentially expressed proteins revealed many metabolism-associated proteins. In detail, four enzymes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were predominantly expressed in T. mairei. Four enzymes associated with supplying precursors for paclitaxel biosynthesis and three cytochrome P450 taxoid oxygenases were preferentially expressed in T. media compared with T. mairei. Furthermore, variations in taxoid contents between T. media and T. mairei were determined using HPLC-MS analysis. Variations in flavonoid contents between T. media and T. mairei were determined by HPLC analysis. A number of differentially expressed proteins may provide an explanation for the variation in metabolisms of different Taxus species.
