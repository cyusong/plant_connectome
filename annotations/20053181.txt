Low concentrations of some trace metals markedly reduce root elongation rate and cause ruptures to root rhizodermal and outer cortical cells in the elongation zone. The interactions between the trace metals and plant components responsible for these effects are not well understood but may be linked to changes in water uptake, cell turgor and cell wall extensibility. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of Al, La, Cu, Gd, Sc and Ru on the saturated hydraulic conductivity of bacterial cellulose (BC)-pectin composites, used as plant cell wall analogs. Hydraulic conductivity was reduced to approximately 30% of the initial flow rate by 39 microM Al and 0.6 microM Cu, approximately 40% by 4.6 microM La, 3 microM Sc and 4.4 microM Ru and approximately 55% by 3.4 microM Gd. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed changes in the ultrastructure of the composites. The results suggest that trace metal binding decreases the hydraulic conductivity through changes in pectin porosity. The experiment illustrates the importance of metal interactions with pectin, and the implications of such an interaction in plant metal toxicity and in normal cell wall processes.
