['21453984', 'The plant hormone cytokinin rapidly alters the steady state transcript levels of  a number of transcription factor genes suggesting that these might have a  function in mediating cytokinin effects. Here we report the analysis of  Arabidopsis thaliana plants with an altered expression level of four different  cytokinin-regulated transcription factor genes. These include GATA22 (also known  as CGA1/GNL), two genes coding for members of the homeodomain zip (HD zip) class  II transcription factor family (HAT4, HAT22), and bHLH64. Ectopic expression of  the GATA22 gene induced the development of chloroplasts in root tissue where it  is normally suppressed and led to the formation of shorter and less branched  roots. Overexpression of HAT22 lowered the seedlings chlorophyll content and  caused an earlier onset of leaf senescence. Enhanced expression of the HAT4 gene  led to severe defects in inflorescence stem development and to a decrease in root  growth and branching, while hat4 insertional mutants developed a larger root  system. 35S:bHLH64 transgenic plants showed a pleiotropic phenotype, consisting  of larger rosettes, reduced chlorophyll content and an elongated and thickened  hypocotyl. Flower development was strongly disturbed leading to sterile plants.  The results are consistent with specific functions of these transcription factor  genes in regulating part of the cytokinin activities and suggest their action as  convergence point with other signalling pathways, particularly those of  gibberellin and light.', '2011 Aug 15', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2011.02.006', 'Schmulling']
