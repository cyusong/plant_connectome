Legumes are able to meet their nitrogen need by establishing nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia. Nitrogen fixation is performed by rhizobia, which has been converted to bacteroids, in newly formed organs, the root nodules. In the model legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i>, nodule cells are invaded by rhizobia through transcellular tubular structures called infection threads (ITs) that are initiated at the root hairs. Here, we describe a novel <i>M. truncatula</i> early symbiotic mutant identified as <i>infection-related epidermal factor</i> (<i>ief</i>), in which the formation of ITs is blocked in the root hair cells and only nodule primordia are formed. We show that the function of <i>MtIEF</i> is crucial for the bacterial infection in the root epidermis but not required for the nodule organogenesis. The <i>IEF</i> gene that appears to have been recruited for a symbiotic function after the duplication of a flower-specific gene is activated by the ERN1-branch of the Nod factor signal transduction pathway and independent of the NIN activity. The expression of <i>MtIEF</i> is induced transiently in the root epidermal cells by the rhizobium partner or Nod factors. Although its expression was not detectable at later stages of symbiosis, complementation experiments indicate that MtIEF is also required for the proper invasion of the nodule cells by rhizobia. The gene encodes an intracellular protein of unknown function possessing a coiled-coil motif and a plant-specific DUF761 domain. The IEF protein interacts with RPG, another symbiotic protein essential for normal IT development, suggesting that combined action of these proteins plays a role in nodule infection.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
