Symplastic domains in plants are defined by spatial limitations on cell-to-cell communication through plasmodesmata (Pds) and establish tissue boundaries necessary for metabolic and developmental programming. With the exception of the physical closure of Pds by callose, the cues and the processes for creating symplastic domains remain poorly understood. Recently, we identified a novel family of eight proteins, called Pd-located protein 1 (PDLP1). These proteins span the plasma membrane within Pds and likely form part of a signal transduction system that perceives external signals to regulate molecular trafficking between cells. For two members of this family that have high expression in the shoot apex we show that they have defined and partially overlapping tissue-specific expression patterns that correlate in part with previously defined symplastic domains. The importance of non-cell-autonomous proteins in shoot development and of the spatial rules that govern leaf and floral development highlight the need to have a clearer understanding of symplastic domains.
