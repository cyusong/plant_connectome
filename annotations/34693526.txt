Root development is a crucial process that determines the ability of plants to acquire nutrients, adapt to the substrate and withstand changing environmental conditions. Root plasticity is controlled by a plethora of transcriptional regulators that allow, in contrast to tissue development in animals, post-embryonic changes that give rise to new tissue and specialized cells. One of these changes is the accommodation in the cortex of hyperbranched hyphae of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, called arbuscules. Arbuscule-containing cells undergo massive reprogramming to coordinate developmental changes with transport processes. Here we describe a novel negative regulator of arbuscule development, MIG3. MIG3 induces and interacts with SCL3, both of which modulate the activity of the central regulator DELLA, restraining cortical cell growth. As in a tug-of-war, MIG3-SCL3 antagonizes the function of the complex MIG1-DELLA, which promotes the cell expansion required for arbuscule development, adjusting cell size during the dynamic processes of the arbuscule life cycle. Our results in the legume plant Medicago truncatula advance the knowledge of root development in dicot plants, showing the existence of additional regulatory elements not present in Arabidopsis that fine-tune the activity of conserved central modules.
