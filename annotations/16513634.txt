['16513634', 'We report that protein phosphorylation is involved in the control of starch  metabolism in Arabidopsis leaves at night. sex4 (starch excess 4) mutants, which  have strongly reduced rates of starch metabolism, lack a protein predicted to be  a dual specificity protein phosphatase. We have shown that this protein is  chloroplastic and can bind to glucans and have presented evidence that it acts to  regulate the initial steps of starch degradation at the granule surface.  Remarkably, the most closely related protein to SEX4 outside the plant kingdom is  laforin, a glucan-binding protein phosphatase required for the metabolism of the  mammalian storage carbohydrate glycogen and implicated in a severe form of  epilepsy (Lafora disease) in humans.', '2006 Apr 28', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M600519200', 'Smith']
