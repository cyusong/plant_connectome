The Special Issue of "Wheat breeding through genetic and physical mapping" aimed to collect recent advances in research on the genetic and physical mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs), candidate genes and regulatory sequences involved in the control of wheat's important agronomic traits, such as grain yield and quality, biotic and abiotic stress resistance [...].

QTLs: !affect! Agronomic traits 
Candidate genes: !control! Wheat's important agronomic traits 
Regulatory sequences: !influence! Control of wheat's important agronomic traits
