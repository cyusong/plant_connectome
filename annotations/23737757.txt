['23737757', 'PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins localize asymmetrically at the plasma membrane and  mediate intercellular polar transport of the plant hormone auxin that is crucial  for a multitude of developmental processes in plants. PIN localization is under  extensive control by environmental or developmental cues, but mechanisms  regulating PIN localization are not fully understood. Here we show that early  endosomal components ARF GEF BEN1 and newly identified Sec1/Munc18 family protein  BEN2 are involved in distinct steps of early endosomal trafficking. BEN1 and BEN2  are collectively required for polar PIN localization, for their dynamic  repolarization, and consequently for auxin activity gradient formation and  auxin-related developmental processes including embryonic patterning,  organogenesis, and vasculature venation patterning. These results show that early  endosomal trafficking is crucial for cell polarity and auxin-dependent regulation  of plant architecture.', '2013 May', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1003540', 'Friml']
