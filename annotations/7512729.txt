['7512729', 'An Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding an analogue, referred to as Arp for  apurinic endonuclease-redox protein, of the human redox factor REF has been  cloned. Arp stimulates in vitro DNA-binding activity of the human transcription  factor Jun and Fos by the reduction of a cysteine residue located in the  DNA-binding domain. Based on amino acid sequence homology, this redox activity is  probably confined to the small internal domain of the Arp protein. In analogy to  REF, we show that the Arabidopsis Arp protein also functions as an  apurinic/apyrimidinic class II endonuclease. This base-free endonuclease activity  resides in the carboxyl-terminal domain, and this part of the protein has  significant sequence similarity to bacterial (Escherichia coli exonuclease III  and Streptococcus pneumoniae exonuclease A) and animal (Drosophila Rrp1 and human  REF/HAP) apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases. The amino-terminal domain of the  Arp protein is highly charged and apparently increases the affinity of the  protein for DNA. Therefore, the Arabidopsis Arp protein is multifunctional and  may be involved both in DNA repair and in the regulation of transcription.', '1994 Apr 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.91.8.3299', 'Inze']
