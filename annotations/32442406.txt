The evolutionary features and molecular innovations that enabled plants to first colonize land are not well understood. Here, insights are provided through our report of the genome sequence of the unicellular alga Penium margaritaceum, a member of the Zygnematophyceae, the sister lineage to land plants. The genome has a high proportion of repeat sequences that are associated with massive segmental gene duplications, likely facilitating neofunctionalization. Compared with representatives of earlier diverging algal lineages, P. margaritaceum has expanded repertoires of gene families, signaling networks, and adaptive responses that highlight the evolutionary trajectory toward terrestrialization. These encompass a broad range of physiological processes and protective cellular features, such as flavonoid compounds and large families of modifying enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, assembly, and remodeling. Transcriptome profiling further elucidated adaptations, responses, and selective pressures associated with the semi-terrestrial ecosystems of P. margaritaceum, where a simple body plan would be an advantage.
