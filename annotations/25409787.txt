Histone methylation is a major component in numerous processes such as determination of flowering time, which is fine-tuned by multiple genetic pathways that integrate both endogenous and environmental signals. Previous studies identified SET DOMAIN GROUP 26 (SDG26) as a histone methyltransferase involved in the activation of flowering, as loss of function of SDG26 caused a late-flowering phenotype in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the SDG26 function and the underlying molecular mechanism remain largely unknown. In this study, we undertook a genetic analysis by combining the sdg26 mutant with mutants of other histone methylation enzymes, including the methyltransferase mutants Arabidopsis trithorax1 (atx1), sdg25 and curly leaf (clf), as well as the demethylase double mutant lsd1-like1 lsd1-like2 (ldl1 ldl2). We found that the early-flowering mutants sdg25, atx1 and clf interact antagonistically with the late-flowering mutant sdg26, whereas the late-flowering mutant ldl1 ldl2 interacts synergistically with sdg26. Based on microarray analysis, we observed weak overlaps in the genes that were differentially expressed between sdg26 and the other mutants. Our analyses of the chromatin of flowering genes revealed that the SDG26 protein binds at the key flowering integrator SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20), and is required for histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) at this locus. Together, our results indicate that SDG26 promotes flowering time through a distinctive genetic pathway, and that loss of function of SDG26 causes a decrease in H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 at its target gene SOC1, leading to repression of this gene and the late-flowering phenotype.
