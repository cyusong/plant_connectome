In Arabidopsis, aluminum (Al) exclusion from the root is mainly facilitated by Al-activated root malate and citrate exudation through the ALMT1 malate transporter and the MATE citrate transporter, respectively. However, the nature of an internal Al tolerance mechanism remains largely unknown. In a recent study, we showed that NIP1;2 facilitates Al-malate transport from the root cell wall into the root symplasm and subsequent root-to-shoot translocation and thus NIP1;2 plays key roles in Al detoxification and internal tolerance in Arabidopsis. We discovered that the NIP1;2-mediated Al removal from the root cell wall requires a functional ALMT1-mediated malate exudation system, which allows the formation of an Al-malate complex in the root cell wall. Thus, a coordinated function between the exclusion and the internal resistance mechanisms, linked by the ALMT1-mediated root malate exudation and the NIP1;2-mediated Al uptake system, is critical for Al resistance in Arabidopsis.
