Blue light triggers stomatal opening through the phototropin-mediated pathway. A new study shows that light-induced stomatal opening is negatively regulated by three closely related plastidial phospholipases and their downstream oxylipin product.

phototropin: !triggers! stomatal opening
plastidial phospholipases: !regulate! stomatal opening
