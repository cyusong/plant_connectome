Environment-sensitive genic male sterility is a type of male sterility that is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Environment-sensitive genic male sterile lines are not only used in two-line hybrid breeding but are also good materials for studying plant-environment interactions. In this study we review the research progress on environment-sensitive genic male sterility in rice from the perspectives of epigenetic, transcriptional, posttranscriptional, posttranslational and metabolic mechanisms as well as signal transduction processes. While significant progress has been made in the genetics, gene cloning and understanding of the molecular mechanisms of environment-sensitive genic male sterility in recent years, the relevant regulatory network is still poorly understood in rice. We therefore also review studies of environment-sensitive genic male sterility in Arabidopsis and other crops, hoping to promote research in this field in rice. Finally, we analyse the challenges posed by environment-sensitive genic male sterility and provide corresponding suggestions. This review will contribute towards an understanding the molecular genetics of environment-sensitive genic male sterility and its application in two-line hybrid breeding in rice and other species.
