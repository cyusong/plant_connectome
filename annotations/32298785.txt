In response to far-red light (FR), FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 1 (FHY1) transports the photoactivated phytochrome A (phyA), the primary FR photoreceptor, into the nucleus, where it initiates FR signaling in plants. Light promotes the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of FHY1, which desensitizes FR signaling, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we show that reversible SUMOylation of FHY1 tightly regulates this process. Lysine K32 (K32) and K103 are major SUMOylation sites of FHY1. We found that FR exposure promotes the SUMOylation of FHY1, which accelerates its degradation. Furthermore, we discovered that ARABIDOPSIS SUMO PROTEASE 1 (ASP1) interacts with FHY1 in the nucleus under FR and facilitates its deSUMOylation. FHY1 was strongly SUMOylated and its protein level was decreased in the asp1-1 loss-of-function mutant compared with that in the wild type under FR. Consistently, asp1-1 seedlings exhibited a decreased sensitivity to FR, suggesting that ASP1 plays an important role in the maintenance of proper FHY1 levels under FR. Genetic analysis further revealed that ASP1 regulates FR signaling through an FHY1- and phyA-dependent pathway. Interestingly, We found that continuous FR inhibits ASP1 accumulation, perhaps contributing to the desensitization of FR signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that FR-induced SUMOylation and ASP1-dependent deSUMOylation of FHY1 represent a key regulatory mechanism that fine-tunes FR signaling.
