['27495811', 'LHP1-INTERACTING FACTOR2 (LIF2), a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein  involved in Arabidopsis thaliana cell fate and stress responses, interacts with  LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1), a Polycomb Repressive Complex1 subunit. To  investigate LIF2-LHP1 functional interplay, we mapped their genome-wide  distributions in wild-type, lif2, and lhp1 backgrounds, under standard and stress  conditions. Interestingly, LHP1-targeted regions form local clusters, suggesting  an underlying functional organization of the plant genome. Regions targeted by  both LIF2 and LHP1 were enriched in stress-responsive genes, the H2A.Z histone  variant, and antagonistic histone marks. We identified specific motifs within the  targeted regions, including a G-box-like motif, a GAGA motif, and a telo-box.  LIF2 and LHP1 can operate both antagonistically and synergistically. In response  to methyl jasmonate treatment, LIF2 was rapidly recruited to chromatin, where it  mediated transcriptional gene activation. Thus, LIF2 and LHP1 participate in  transcriptional switches in stress-response pathways.', '2016 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00244', 'ORCID:']
