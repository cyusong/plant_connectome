Recent genetic analysis showed that phototropins (phot1 and phot2) function as blue light receptors in stomatal opening of Arabidopsis thaliana, but no biochemical evidence was provided for this. We prepared a large quantity of guard cell protoplasts from Arabidopsis. The immunological method indicated that phot1 was present in guard cell protoplasts from the wild-type plant and the phot2 mutant, that phot2 was present in those from the wild-type plant and the phot1 mutant, and that neither phot1 nor phot2 was present in those from the phot1 phot2 double mutant. However, the same amounts of plasma membrane H+-ATPase were found in all of these plants. H+ pumping was induced by blue light in isolated guard cell protoplasts from the wild type, from the single mutants of phototropins (phot1-5 and phot2-1), and from the zeaxanthin-less mutant (npq1-2), but not from the phot1 phot2 double mutant. Moreover, increased ATP hydrolysis and the binding of 14-3-3 protein to the H+-ATPase were found in response to blue light in guard cell protoplasts from the wild type, but not from the phot1 phot2 double mutant. These results indicate that phot1 and phot2 mediate blue light-dependent activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase and illustrate that Arabidopsis guard cell protoplasts can be useful for biochemical analysis of stomatal functions. We determined isogenes of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase and found the expression of all isogenes of functional plasma membrane H+-ATPases (AHA1-11) in guard cell protoplasts.
