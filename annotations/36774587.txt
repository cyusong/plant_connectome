Starch in the stomatal guard cells is largely synthesized using carbon precursors originating from sugars imported from the leaf mesophyll. Such heterotrophic nature of guard cell starch synthesis prompted us to investigate the role of cytosolic sucrose synthases (SUS) in this pathway. Out of the six members of the Arabidopsis <i>SUS</i> gene family, <i>SUS3</i> was the most highly expressed isoform in guard cells. The Arabidopsis <i>sus3</i> mutant displayed changes in guard cell starch contents comparable to the Wild Type (WT) up until 6 h into the day. After this time point, <i>sus3</i> guard cells surprisingly started to accumulate starch at very high rates, reaching the end of the day with significantly more starch than WT. Based on the phenotype of the <i>sus3</i> mutant, we suggest that in guard cells, SUS3 is involved in the regulation of carbon fluxes towards starch synthesis during the second half of the day. SUS3 may be part of a previously predicted guard cell futile cycle of metabolic reactions, in which sucrose is re-synthesized from UDP-glucose to avoid excessive starch synthesis toward the end of the day. This is in contrast to typical storage organs, in which cytosolic SUS is required to produce ADP-glucose for starch synthesis.
