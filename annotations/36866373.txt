The Arabidopsis homeodomain transcription factor <i>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS</i> (<i>STM</i>) is crucial for shoot apical meristem (SAM) function, which cooperates with <i>CLAVATA3</i> (<i>CLV3</i>)<i>/WUSCHEL</i> (<i>WUS</i>) feedback regulation loops to maintain the homeostasis of stem cells in SAM. <i>STM</i> also interacts with the boundary genes to regulate the tissue boundary formation. However, there are still few studies on the function of <i>STM</i> in <i>Brassica napus</i>, an important oil crop. There are two homologs of <i>STM</i> in <i>B. napus</i> (<i>BnaA09g13310D</i> and <i>BnaC09g13580D</i>). In the present study, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was employed to create the stable site-directed single and double mutants of the <i>BnaSTM</i> genes in <i>B. napus.</i> The absence of SAM could be observed only in the <i>BnaSTM</i> double mutants at the mature embryo of seed, indicating that the redundant roles of <i>BnaA09.STM</i> and <i>BnaC09.STM</i> are vital for regulating SAM development. However, different from Arabidopsis, the SAM gradually recovered on the third day after seed germination in <i>Bnastm</i> double mutants, resulting in delayed true leaves development but normal late vegetative and reproductive growth in <i>B. napus</i>. The <i>Bnastm</i> double mutant displayed a fused cotyledon petiole phenotype at the seedling stage, which was similar but not identical to the <i>Atstm</i> in Arabidopsis. Further, transcriptome analysis showed that targeted mutation of <i>BnaSTM</i> caused significant changes for genes involved in the SAM boundary formation (<i>CUC2</i>, <i>CUC3</i>, <i>LBDs</i>). In addition, <i>Bnastm</i> also caused significant changes of a sets of genes related to organogenesis. Our findings reveal that the <i>BnaSTM</i> plays an important yet distinct role during SAM maintenance as compared to Arabidopsis.
