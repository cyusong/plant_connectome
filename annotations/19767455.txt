['19767455', 'AGAMOUS-Like15 (AGL15) is a MADS domain transcriptional regulator that promotes  somatic embryogenesis by binding DNA and regulating gene expression. Chromatin  immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis previously identified DNA fragments with  which AGL15 associates in vivo, and a low-throughput approach revealed a role for  AGL15 in gibberellic acid catabolism that is relevant to embryogenesis. However,  higher throughput methods are needed to identify targets of AGL15. Here, we  mapped AGL15 in vivo binding sites using a ChIP-chip approach and the Affymetrix  tiling arrays for Arabidopsis thaliana and found that approximately 2000 sites  represented in three biological replicates of the experiment are annotated to  nearby genes. These results were combined with high-throughput measurement of  gene expression in response to AGL15 accumulation to discriminate responsive  direct targets from those further downstream in the network. LEAFY COTYLEDON2,  FUSCA3, and ABA INSENSITIVE3, which encode B3 domain transcription factors that  are key regulators of embryogenesis, were identified and verified as direct  target genes of AGL15. Genes identified as targets of the B3 genes are also  targets of AGL15, and we found that INDOLEACETIC ACID-INDUCED PROTEIN30 is  involved in promotion of somatic embryo development. The data presented here and  elsewhere suggest that much cross-regulation occurs in gene regulatory networks  underpinning embryogenesis.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.068890', 'Perry']
