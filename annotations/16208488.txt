Soybean is a short-day plant and its flowering process can be reversed when switching from short-day to long-day conditions. Flowering reversion provides a useful system to study the flowering process in both forward and backward directions. In this study, we optimized a soybean flowering reversion system using a photoperiod-sensitive cultivar Zigongdongdou. Three types of terminal structures were found during flowering reversion: reversed terminal raceme (RTR), short terminal raceme (STR), and vegetative terminal (VT). The relative frequency of these terminal structures during flowering reversion under long day was dependent on the duration of the prior short day (SD) pretreatment. This process is phytochrome dependent and young plants were more susceptible to flowering reversion. Leaf removal increased the minimal SD period needed for the induction of STR. To demonstrate the application of this system, we studied the patterns of in situ expression of the GmNMH7 gene during flowering development and reversion. NMH7 family members encode MADS-box proteins and are unique in legume families since their expression can be detected in both developing flowers and nodules. In situ hybridization experiments using plants grown under different photoperiod cycles provided several lines of evidence supporting a close relationship between GmNMH7 gene expression and floral development in soybean. Furthermore, it seems that GmNMH7 may participate in flower development at different stages. Interestingly, the expression pattern of GmNMH7 in root nodules was also found to be regulated by photoperiod. These results support the notion that the photoperiod sensitive GmNMH7 gene may play multiple roles in growth and development in soybean.
