In CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated protein 9)-mediated genome editing in plants, Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) protein and the required guide RNA (gRNA) are, in most cases, expressed from a stably integrated transgene. Generally, SpCas9 protein is expressed from an RNA polymerase (pol) II promoter, while gRNA is expressed from a pol III promoter. However, pol III promoters have not been much characterized other than in model plants, making it difficult to select appropriate promoters for specific applications, while pol II transcripts have to be processed to generate functional gRNAs. Recently, successful processing of a pol II transcript into functional gRNAs using ribozyme or Csy4-RNA cleavage systems has been demonstrated. Here, we show that functional gRNAs can be efficiently processed using SpCas9 protein and plant endogenous RNA cleavage systems without the need for a specific RNA processing system. In our system, SpCas9 RNA and gRNA are both transcribed as a single RNA using a single pol II promoter; translated SpCas9 protein can be bound to this RNA and, finally, extra RNA sequences are trimmed by plant RNA processing systems to form a functional SpCas9-gRNA complex. The efficiency of targeted mutagenesis using our novel SpCas9-gRNA fused system was comparable with that of the SpCas9-gRNA system with ribozyme sequence, achieving rates of up to 100% in rice. Our results could be useful in developing stable SpCas9-gRNA expression systems and in RNA virus vector-mediated genome editing systems in plants.
