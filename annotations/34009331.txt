Meiosis is a key feature of sexual reproduction. During meiosis homologous chromosomes replicate, recombine, and randomly segregate, followed by the segregation of sister chromatids to produce haploid cells. The unique genotypes of recombinant gametes are an essential substrate for the selection of superior genotypes in natural populations and in plant breeding. In this review we summarize current knowledge on meiosis in diverse monocot and dicot crop species and provide a comprehensive resource of cloned meiotic mutants in six crop species (rice, maize, wheat, barley, tomato, and Brassica species). Generally, the functional roles of meiotic proteins are conserved between plant species, but we highlight notable differences in mutant phenotypes. The physical lengths of plant chromosomes vary greatly; for instance, wheat chromosomes are roughly one order of magnitude longer than those of rice. We explore how chromosomal distribution for crossover recombination can vary between species. We conclude that research on meiosis in crops will continue to complement that in Arabidopsis, and alongside possible applications in plant breeding will facilitate a better understanding of how the different stages of meiosis are controlled in plant species.
