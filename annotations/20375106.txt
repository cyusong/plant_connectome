For a better understanding of the metabolic interaction between chloroplasts and mitochondria, it is important to analyze the in vivo redox states of the electron transport chains in both organelles at the same time. For this purpose, we devised an HPLC-based measurement system simultaneously analyzing plastoquinone (PQ) and ubiquinone (UQ) contents and redox states. Using this system, we discovered that, in addition to PQ, the reduction levels of UQ were elevated under high-light conditions. We also provide direct evidence that mitochondrial alternative oxidase contributes to alleviate UQ over-reduction under such conditions.

PQ: !elevates! UQ
UQ: !over-reduces! under high-light conditions
alternative oxidase: !contributes to! alleviate UQ over-reduction
