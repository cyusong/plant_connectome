Antimony (Sb) is toxic to organisms including plants. Although it is not essential to organisms, plants take up Sb from the environment. In this study, we identified an antimonite [Sb(III)] transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana. We examined the Sb(III) tolerance of the disruption mutant plants of arsenite [As(III)] transporters, nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), since Sb(III) is similar to As(III) in structure. One of the mutants, nip1;1, showed Sb(III) tolerance and accumulated less Sb. Furthermore, yeast expressing NIP1;1 accumulated twice as much Sb as control. These data indicate that NIP1;1 transports Sb(III) and determines the Sb(III) sensitivity of A. thaliana.
