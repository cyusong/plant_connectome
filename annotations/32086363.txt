Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), an mRNA quality control process, is thought to function in plant immunity. A subset of fully spliced (FS) transcripts of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) resistance (<i>R</i>) genes are upregulated during bacterial infection. Here, we report that 81.2% and 65.1% of FS natural TIR-NBS-LRR (TNL) and CC-NBS-LRR transcripts, respectively, retain characteristics of NMD regulation, as their transcript levels could be controlled posttranscriptionally. Both bacterial infection and the perception of bacteria by pattern recognition receptors initiated the destruction of core NMD factors UP-FRAMESHIFT1 (UPF1), UPF2, and UPF3 in Arabidopsis within 30 min of inoculation via the independent ubiquitination of UPF1 and UPF3 and their degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway. The induction of UPF1 and UPF3 ubiquitination was delayed in <i>mitogen</i>-<i>activated protein kinase3</i> (<i>mpk3</i>) and <i>mpk6</i>, but not in salicylic acid-signaling mutants, during the early immune response. Finally, previously uncharacterized TNL-type <i>R</i> transcripts accumulated in <i>upf</i> mutants and conferred disease resistance to infection with a virulent <i>Pseudomonas</i> strain in plants. Our findings demonstrate that NMD is one of the main regulatory processes through which PRRs fine-tune <i>R</i> transcript levels to reduce fitness costs and achieve effective immunity.
