['31048693', 'RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6/JMJ12), a Jumonji C (JmjC)-domain-containing  H3K27me3 histone demethylase, finds its target loci in Arabidopsis genome by  directly recognizing the CTCTGYTY motif via its zinc-finger (ZnF) domains. REF6  tends to bind motifs located in active chromatin states that are depleted for  heterochromatic modifications. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown.  Here, we show that REF6 preferentially bind to hypo-methylated CTCTGYTY motifs in  vivo, and that CHG methylation decreases REF6 DNA binding affinity in vitro. In  addition, crystal structures of ZnF-clusters in complex with DNA oligonucleotides  reveal that 5-methylcytosine is unfavorable for REF6 binding. In drm1 drm2 cmt2  cmt3 (ddcc) quadruple mutants, in which non-CG methylation is significantly  reduced, REF6 can ectopically bind a small number of new target loci, most of  which are located in or neighbored with short TEs in euchromatic regions.  Collectively, our findings reveal that DNA methylation, likely acting in  combination with other epigenetic modifications, may partially explain why REF6  binding is depleted in heterochromatic loci.', '2019 May 2', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-019-10026-1', 'ORCID:']
