Phytohormones are crucial molecules regulating plant development and responses to environmental challenges, including abiotic stresses, microbial and insect attacks. Most notably, phytohormones play important roles in the biosynthesis of lignocellulosics. Jasmonates are involved in secondary growth and secondary metabolism, such as phenylpropanoids and lignin biosyntheses. At the physiological and molecular levels, the actions of phytohormones depend on subtle concentration changes, as well as antagonistic equilibria between two or more of these molecules. In this article, we investigate the consequences of jasmonic acid (JA) spraying on young hemp hypocotyls. First, we show that JA application results in changes in the monomeric composition of lignin. Second, we highlight that, five days after application, JA leads to an increase in salicylic acid (SA) content in hemp hypocotyls. These results are discussed in the light of the known antagonism between JA and SA at both the physiological and molecular levels.
