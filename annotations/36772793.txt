Comprehensive utilization of cottonseeds is limited by the presence of pigment glands and its inclusion gossypol. The ideal cotton has glandless seeds but a glanded plant, a trait found in only a few Australian wild cotton species, including Gossypium bickii. Introgression of this trait into cultivated species has proved to be difficult. Understanding the biological processes toward pigment gland morphogenesis and the associated underlying molecular mechanisms will facilitate breeding of cultivated cotton varieties with the trait of glandless seeds and glanded plant. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on 12 222 protoplasts isolated from cotyledons of germinating G. bickii seeds 48 h after imbibition. Clustered into 14 distinct clusters unsupervisedly, these cells could be grouped into eight cell populations with the assistance of known cell marker genes. The pigment gland cells were well separated from others and could be separated into pigment gland parenchyma cells, secretory cells, and apoptotic cells. By integrating the pigment gland cell developmental trajectory, transcription factor regulatory networks, and core transcription factor functional validation, we established a model for pigment gland formation. In this model, light and gibberellin were verified to promote the formation of pigment glands. In addition, three novel genes, GbiERF114 (ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 114), GbiZAT11 (ZINC FINGER OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 11), and GbiNTL9 (NAC TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-LIKE 9), were found to affect pigment gland formation. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into pigment gland morphogenesis and lay the cornerstone for future cotton scRNA-seq investigations.
