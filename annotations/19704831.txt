Protein kinase CK2 is a pleitropic Ser/Thr kinase present in all eukaryotes. In order to study the effects of CK2 depletion on plant development, we have recently generated Arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing a CK2alpha-inactive mutant under the control of an inducible promoter. Our results showed that continuous expression of the transgene had a dominant negative effect and was lethal for Arabidopsis plants. Overexpression of the CK2alpha-inactive subunit provoked cell cycle arrest, by perturbation of both G(1)/S and G(2) cell cycle phases. The effects on cell division were particularly strong in root meristems, causing inhibition of lateral root formation even when the mutant protein was transiently induced. Processes that rely on cell expansion, such as hypocotyl elongation in dark-grown seedlings, were also strongly affected. We propose that CK2 regulates auxin-signaling pathways.
