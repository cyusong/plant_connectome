Oxygenic phototrophs have played a fundamental role in Earth's history by enabling the rise of atmospheric oxygen (O<sub>2</sub> ) and paving the way for animal evolution. Understanding the origins of oxygenic photosynthesis and Cyanobacteria is key when piecing together the events around Earth's oxygenation. It is likely that photosynthesis evolved within bacterial lineages that are not extant, so it can be challenging when studying the early history of photosynthesis. Recent genomic and molecular evolution studies have transformed our understanding about the evolution of photosynthetic reaction centres and the evolution of Cyanobacteria. The evidence reviewed here highlights some of the most recent advances on the origin of photosynthesis both at the genomic and gene family levels.
