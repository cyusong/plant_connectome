Cytoskeleton serves as structural, membrane-bound and highly nonlinear dynamics element that basically functions in abiotic and biotic stresses. The study of phospholipid-regulated cytoskeletal organization to strengthen plants against stresses is emerging. Phospholipids in lipid bilayers, as the main compound of cellular membranes, have roles in modulation of membrane curvature and anchoring, cross-linking or regulating particular cytoskeletal proteins to modulate cytoskeletal dynamics. In this review, we highlight the role of phospholipids and their metabolic enzymes through regulating cytoskeletal organization and dynamics in response to abiotic stresses, such as salt, drought and low/high temperature stresses.
