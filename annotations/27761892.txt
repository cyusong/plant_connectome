Transcript and metabolite profiling were performed on leaves from six rice cultivars under high night temperature (HNT) condition. Six genes were identified as central for HNT response encoding proteins involved in transcription regulation, signal transduction, protein-protein interactions, jasmonate response and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Sensitive cultivars showed specific changes in transcript abundance including abiotic stress responses, changes of cell wall-related genes, of ABA signaling and secondary metabolism. Additionally, metabolite profiles revealed a highly activated TCA cycle under HNT and concomitantly increased levels in pathways branching off that could be corroborated by enzyme activity measurements. Integrated data analysis using clustering based on one-dimensional self-organizing maps identified two profiles highly correlated with HNT sensitivity. The sensitivity profile included genes of the functional bins abiotic stress, hormone metabolism, cell wall, signaling, redox state, transcription factors, secondary metabolites and defence genes. In the tolerance profile, similar bins were affected with slight differences in hormone metabolism and transcription factor responses. Metabolites of the two profiles revealed involvement of GABA signaling, thus providing a link to the TCA cycle status in sensitive cultivars and of myo-inositol as precursor for inositol phosphates linking jasmonate signaling to the HNT response specifically in tolerant cultivars.
