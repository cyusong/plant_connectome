Maintaining low intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations is an essential physiological strategy in salt stress tolerance in most cereal crops. Here, we characterized a member of the high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> transporter (HKT) family in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), HvHKT1;5, which negatively regulates salt tolerance and has different functions from its homology in other cereal crops. <i>HvHKT1</i>;<i>5</i> encodes a plasma membrane protein localized to root stele cells, particularly in xylem parenchyma cells adjacent to the xylem vessels. Its expression was highly induced by salt stress. Heterogenous expression of <i>HvHKT1</i>;<i>5</i> in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes showed that HvHKT1;5 was permeable to Na<sup>+</sup>, but not to K<sup>+</sup>, although its Na<sup>+</sup> transport activity was inhibited by external K<sup>+</sup> <i>HvHKT1</i>;<i>5</i> knockdown barley lines showed improved salt tolerance, a dramatic decrease in Na<sup>+</sup> translocation from roots to shoots, and increases in K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> when compared with wild-type plants under salt stress. The negative regulation of HvHKT1;5 in salt tolerance distinguishes it from other HKT1;5 members, indicating that barley has a distinct Na<sup>+</sup> transport system. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the functions of HKT family members and the regulation of <i>HvHKT1</i>;<i>5</i> in improving salt tolerance of barley.
