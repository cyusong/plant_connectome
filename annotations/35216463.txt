Grain weight, a crucial trait that determines the grain yield in rice, is influenced by grain size. Although a series of regulators that control grain size have been identified in rice, the mechanisms underlying grain development are not yet well understood. In this study, we identified OsPUB43, a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, as an important negative regulator determining the gain size and grain weight in rice. Phenotypes of large grain are observed in <i>ospub43</i> mutants, whereas overexpression of <i>OsPUB43</i> results in short grains. Scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that <i>OsPUB43</i> modulates the grain size mainly by inhibiting cell proliferation in the spikelet hull. The OsPUB43 protein is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The <i>ospub43</i> mutants display high sensitivity to exogenous BR, while <i>OsPUB43</i>-OE lines are hyposensitive to BR. Furthermore, the transient transcriptional activity assay shows that OsBZR1 can activate the expression of <i>OsPUB43</i>. Collectively, our results indicate that OsPUB43 negatively controls the gain size by modulating the expression of BR-responsive genes as well as MADS-box genes that are required for lemma/palea specification, suggesting that OsPUB43 has a potential valuable application in the enlargement of grain size in rice.
