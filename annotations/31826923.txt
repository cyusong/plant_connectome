['31826923', 'The developmental program of seed formation, germination, and early seedling  growth requires not only tight regulation of cell division and metabolism, but  also concerted control of the structure and function of organelles, which relies  on specific changes in their protein composition. Of particular interest is the  switch from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic seedling growth, for which  cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) play a critical role as depots for energy-rich  storage lipids. Here, we present the results of a bottom-up proteomics study  analyzing the total protein fractions and LD-enriched fractions in eight  different developmental phases during silique (seed) development, seed  germination, and seedling establishment in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).  The quantitative analysis of the LD proteome using LD-enrichment factors led to  the identification of six previously unidentified and comparably low-abundance LD  proteins, each of which was confirmed by intracellular localization studies with  fluorescent protein fusions. In addition to these advances in LD protein  discovery and the potential insights provided to as yet unexplored aspects in  plant LD functions, our data set allowed for a comparative analysis of the LD  protein composition throughout the various developmental phases examined. Among  the most notable of the alterations in the LD proteome were those during seedling  establishment, indicating a switch in the physiological function(s) of LDs after  greening of the cotyledons. This work highlights LDs as dynamic organelles with  functions beyond lipid storage.', '2020 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.01255', 'ORCID:']
