In eukaryotic cells, the endocytic and secretory pathways are key players in several physiological processes. These pathways are largely inter-connected in animal and yeast cells through organelles named sorting endosomes. Sorting endosomes are multi-vesicular compartments that redirect proteins towards various destinations, such as the lysosomes or vacuoles for degradation, the trans-Golgi network for retrograde transport and the plasma membrane for recycling. In contrast, cross-talk between the endocytic and secretory pathways has not been clearly established in plants, especially in terms of cargo protein trafficking. Here we show by co-localization analyses that endosomes labelled with the AtSORTING NEXIN1 (AtSNX1) protein overlap with the pre-vacuolar compartment in Arabidopsis root cells. In addition, alteration of the routing functions of AtSNX1 endosomes by drug treatments leads to mis-routing of endocytic and secretory cargo proteins. Based on these results, we propose that the AtSNX1 endosomal compartment represents a sorting endosome in root cells, and that this specialized organelle is conserved throughout eukaryotes.
