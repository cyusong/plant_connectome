Understanding the pronounced seasonal and spatial variation in leaf carboxylation capacity (V<sub>c,max</sub> ) is critical for determining terrestrial carbon cycling in tropical forests. However, an efficient and scalable approach for predicting V<sub>c,max</sub> is still lacking. Here the ability of leaf spectroscopy for rapid estimation of V<sub>c,max</sub> was tested. V<sub>c,max</sub> was estimated using traditional gas exchange methods, and measured reflectance spectra and leaf age in leaves sampled from tropical forests in Panama and Brazil. These data were used to build a model to predict V<sub>c,max</sub> from leaf spectra. The results demonstrated that leaf spectroscopy accurately predicts V<sub>c,max</sub> of mature leaves in Panamanian tropical forests (R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.90). However, this single-age model required recalibration when applied to broader leaf demographic classes (i.e. immature leaves). Combined use of spectroscopy models for V<sub>c,max</sub> and leaf age enabled construction of the V<sub>c,max</sub> -age relationship solely from leaf spectra, which agreed with field observations. This suggests that the spectroscopy technique can capture the seasonal variability in V<sub>c,max</sub> , assuming sufficient sampling across diverse species, leaf ages and canopy environments. This finding will aid development of remote sensing approaches that can be used to characterize V<sub>c,max</sub> in moist tropical forests and enable an efficient means to parameterize and evaluate terrestrial biosphere models.
