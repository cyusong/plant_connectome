['12165296', 'In the Arabidopsis mutant irx3, truncation of the AtCesA7 gene encoding a  xylem-specific cellulose synthase results in reduced cellulose synthesis in the  affected xylem cells and collapse of mature xylem vessels. Here we describe  spectroscopic experiments to determine whether any cellulose, normal or abnormal,  remained in the walls of these cells and whether there were consequent effects on  other cell-wall polysaccharides. Xylem cell walls from irx3 and its wild-type  were prepared by anatomically specific isolation and were examined by solid-state  NMR spectroscopy and FTIR microscopy. The affected cell walls of irx3 contained  low levels of crystalline cellulose, probably associated with primary cell walls.  There was no evidence that crystalline cellulose was replaced by less ordered  glucans. From the molecular mobility of xylans and lignin it was deduced that  these non-cellulosic polymers were cross-linked together in both irx3 and the  wild-type. The disorder previously observed in the spatial pattern of  non-cellulosic polymer deposition in the secondary walls of irx3 xylem could not  be explained by any alteration in the structure or cross-linking of these  polymers and may be attributed directly to the absence of cellulose microfibrils  which, in the wild-type, scaffold the organisation of the other polymers into a  coherent secondary cell wall.', '2002 Sep', 'Phytochemistry', '10.1016/s0031-9422(02)00199-1', 'Jarvis']
