['17082420', 'Iron deficiency is a major human nutritional problem wherever plant-based diets  are common. Using synchrotron x-ray fluorescence microtomography to directly  visualize iron in Arabidopsis seeds, we show that iron is localized primarily to  the provascular strands of the embryo. This localization is completely abolished  when the vacuolar iron uptake transporter VIT1 is disrupted. Vacuolar iron  storage is also critical for seedling development because vit1-1 seedlings grow  poorly when iron is limiting. We have uncovered a fundamental aspect of seed  biology that will ultimately aid the development of nutrient-rich seed,  benefiting both human health and agricultural productivity.', '2006 Nov 24', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1132563', 'Guerinot']
