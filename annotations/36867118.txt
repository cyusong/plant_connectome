Annis Richardson is the Lecturer in Molecular Crop Science at the University of Edinburgh, UK. Her research employs a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing organ development and evolution in grass crops, such as maize. In 2022, Annis was awarded a Starting Grant from the European Research Council. We spoke to Annis over Microsoft Teams to learn more about her career trajectory, her research and her agricultural roots.
