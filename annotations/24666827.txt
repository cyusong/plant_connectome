['24666827', "BACKGROUND: A mutant screening was carried out previously to look for new genes  related to the Cucumber mosaic virus infection response in Arabidopsis. A Pumilio  RNA binding protein-coding gene, Arabidopsis Pumilio RNA binding protein 5  (APUM5), was obtained from this screening. RESULTS: APUM5 transcriptional  profiling was carried out using a bioinformatics tool. We found that APUM5 was  associated with both biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, bacterial and  fungal pathogen infection susceptibility was not changed in APUM5 transgenic  plants compared to that in wild type plants although APUM5 expression was induced  upon pathogen infection. In contrast, APUM5 was involved in the abiotic stress  response. 35S-APUM5 transgenic plants showed hypersensitive phenotypes under salt  and drought stresses during germination, primary root elongation at the seedling  stage, and at the vegetative stage in soil. We also showed that some abiotic  stress-responsive genes were negatively regulated in 35S-APUM5 transgenic plants.  The APUM5-Pumilio homology domain (PHD) protein bound to the 3' untranslated  region (UTR) of the abiotic stress-responsive genes which contained putative  Pumilio RNA binding motifs at the 3' UTR. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that  APUM5 may be a new post-transcriptional regulator of the abiotic stress response  by direct binding of target genes 3' UTRs.", '2014 Mar 25', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-14-75', 'Paek']
