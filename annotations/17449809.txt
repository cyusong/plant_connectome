['17449809', 'Cyclin D (CYCD) plays an important role in cell cycle progression and reentry in  response to external signals. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana  CYCD4 is associated with specific cell divisions in the hypocotyl. We observed  that cycd4 T-DNA insertion mutants had a reduced number of nonprotruding cells  and stomata in the hypocotyl epidermis. Conversely, CYCD4 overexpression enhanced  cell division in nonprotruding cell files in the upper region of the hypocotyls,  where stomata are usually formed in wild-type plants. The overproliferative cells  were of stomatal lineage, which is marked by the expression of the TOO MANY  MOUTHS gene, but unlike the meristemoids, most of them were not triangular.  Although the phytohormone gibberellin promoted stomatal differentiation in the  hypocotyl, inhibition of gibberellin biosynthesis did not prevent CYCD4 from  inducing cell division. These results suggested that CYCD4 has a specialized  function in the proliferation of stomatal lineage progenitors rather than in  stomatal differentiation. We propose that CYCD4 controls cell division in the  initial step of stomata formation in the hypocotyl.', '2007 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.046763', 'Umeda']
