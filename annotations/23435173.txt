Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, established between AM fungi (AMF) and roots of higher plants, occurs in most terrestrial ecosystems. It has been well demonstrated that AM symbiosis can improve plant performance under various environmental stresses, including drought stress. However, the molecular basis for the direct involvement of AMF in plant drought tolerance has not yet been established. Most recently, we cloned two functional aquaporin genes, GintAQPF1 and GintAQPF2, from AM fungus Glomus intraradices. By heterologous gene expression in yeast, aquaporin localization, activities and water permeability were examined. Gene expressions during symbiosis in expose to drought stress were also analyzed. Our data strongly supported potential water transport via AMF to host plants. As a complement, here we adopted the monoxenic culture system for AMF, in which carrot roots transformed by Ri-T DNA were cultured with Glomus intraradices in two-compartment Petri dishes, to verify the aquaporin gene functions in assisting AMF survival under polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. Our results showed that 25% PEG significantly upregulated the expression of two aquaporin genes, which was in line with the gene functions examined in yeast. We therefore concluded that the aquaporins function similarly in AMF as in yeast subjected to osmotic stress. The study provided further evidence to the direct involvement of AMF in improving plant water relations under drought stresses.
