['20731781', 'The flavonol branch of flavonoid biosynthesis is under transcriptional control of  the R2R3-MYBs production of flavonol glycoside1 (PFG1/MYB12, PFG2/MYB11 and  PFG3/MYB111) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we investigated the influence of  specific PFG transcription factors on flavonol distribution in various organs. A  combination of genetic and metabolite analysis was used to identify transcription  factor gene-metabolite correlations of the flavonol metabolic pathway. Flavonol  glycoside accumulation patterns have been analysed in wild-type and multiple  R2R3-MYB PFG mutants in an organ- and development-dependent manner using  high-performance thin-layer chromatography, supplemented with liquid  chromatography-mass spectroscopy metabolite profiling. Our results clearly  demonstrate a differential influence of MYB11, MYB12 and MYB111 on the spatial  accumulation of specific flavonol derivatives in leaves, stems, inflorescences,  siliques and roots. In addition, MYB11-, MYB12- and MYB111-independent flavonol  glycoside accumulation was observed in pollen grains and siliques/seeds. The  highly complex tissue- and developmental-specific regulation of flavonol  biosynthesis in A. thaliana is orchestrated by at least four PFG transcription  factors, differentially influencing the spatial accumulation of specific flavonol  derivatives. We present evidence that a separate flavonol control mechanism might  be at play in pollen.', '2010 Dec', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03421.x', 'Weisshaar']
