The genus <i>Stagonosporopsis</i> is classified within the Didymellaceae family and has around 40 associated species. Among them, several species are important plant pathogens responsible for significant losses in economically important crops worldwide. <i>Stagonosporopsis vannaccii</i> is a newly described species pathogenic to soybean. Here, we present the draft whole-genome sequence, gene prediction, and annotation of <i>S. vannaccii</i> isolate LFN0148 (also known as IMI 507030). To our knowledge, this is the first genome sequenced of this species and represents a new useful source for future research on fungal comparative genomics studies.
