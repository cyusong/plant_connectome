['23175745', 'In this article, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in Arabidopsis  thaliana undergoes morphological changes in structure during ER stress that can  be attributed to autophagy. ER stress agents trigger autophagy as demonstrated by  increased production of autophagosomes. In response to ER stress, a soluble ER  marker localizes to autophagosomes and accumulates in the vacuole upon inhibition  of vacuolar proteases. Membrane lamellae decorated with ribosomes were observed  inside autophagic bodies, demonstrating that portions of the ER are delivered to  the vacuole by autophagy during ER stress. In addition, an ER stress sensor,  INOSITOL-REQUIRING ENZYME-1b (IRE1b), was found to be required for ER  stress-induced autophagy. However, the IRE1b splicing target, bZIP60, did not  seem to be involved, suggesting the existence of an undiscovered signaling  pathway to regulate ER stress-induced autophagy in plants. Together, these  results suggest that autophagy serves as a pathway for the turnover of ER  membrane and its contents in response to ER stress in plants.', '2012 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.101535', 'Bassham']
