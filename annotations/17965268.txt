The mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (Complex I) is a large protein complex formed from both nuclearly and mitochondrially encoded subunits. Subunit ND1 is encoded by a mitochondrial gene comprising five exons, and the mature transcript requires four RNA splicing events, two of which involve trans-splicing independently transcribed RNAs. We have identified a nuclear gene (OTP43) absolutely required for trans-splicing of intron 1 (and only intron 1) of Arabidopsis thaliana nad1 transcripts. This gene encodes a previously uncharacterized pentatricopeptide repeat protein. Mutant Arabidopsis plants with a disrupted OTP43 gene do not present detectable mitochondrial Complex I activity and show severe defects in seed development, germination, and to a lesser extent in plant growth. The alternative respiratory pathway involving alternative oxidase is significantly induced in the mutant.
