Engineered minichromosomes were constructed in maize by modifying natural A and supernumerary B chromosomes. By using telomere-mediated chromosomal truncation, it was demonstrated that such an approach is feasible for the generation of minichromosomes of normal A chromosomes by selection of spontaneous polyploid events that compensate for the deficiencies produced. B chromosomes are readily fractionated by biolistic transformation of truncating plasmids. Foreign genes were faithfully expressed from integrations into normal B chromosomes and from truncated miniB chromosomes. Site-specific recombination between the terminal transgene on a miniA chromosome and a terminal site on a normal chromosome was demonstrated. It was also found that the miniA chromosome did not pair with its progenitor chromosomes during meiosis, indicating a useful property for such constructs. The miniB chromosomes are faithfully transmitted from one generation to the next but can be changed in dosage in the presence of normal B chromosomes. This approach for construction of engineered chromosomes can be easily extended to other plant species because it does not rely on cloned centromere sequences, which are species-specific. These platforms will provide avenues for studies on plant chromosome structure and function and for future developments in biotechnology and agriculture.
