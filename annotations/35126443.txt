With the increasing amount of cotton omics data, breeding scientists are confronted with the question of how to use massive cotton data to mine effective breeding information. Here, we construct a <i>Gossypium</i> Resource And Network Database (GRAND), which integrates 18 cotton genome sequences, genome annotations, two cotton genome variations information, and also four transcriptomes for <i>Gossypium</i> species. GRAND allows to explore and mine this data with the help of a toolbox that comprises a flexible search system, BLAST and BLAT suite, orthologous gene ID, networks of co-expressed genes, primer design, Gbrowse and Jbrowse, and drawing instruments. GRAND provides important information regarding <i>Gossypium</i> resources and hopefully can accelerate the progress of cultivating cotton varieties.
