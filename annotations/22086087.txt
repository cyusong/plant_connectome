Increases in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)) mediate plant responses to stress by regulating the expression of genes encoding proteins that confer tolerance. Several plant stress genes have previously been shown to be calcium-regulated, and in one case, a specific promoter motif Abscisic Acid Responsive-Element (ABRE) has been found to be regulated by calcium. A comprehensive survey of the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome for calcium-regulated promoter motifs was performed by measuring the expression of genes in Arabidopsis seedlings responding to three calcium elevations of different characteristics, using full genome microarray analysis. This work revealed a total of 269 genes upregulated by [Ca(2+)](c) in Arabidopsis. Bioinformatic analysis strongly indicated that at least four promoter motifs were [Ca(2+)](c)-regulated in planta. We confirmed this finding by expressing in plants chimeric gene constructs controlled exclusively by these cis-elements and by testing the necessity and sufficiency of calcium for their expression. Our data reveal that the C-Repeat/Drought-Responsive Element, Site II, and CAM box (along with the previously identified ABRE) promoter motifs are calcium-regulated. The identification of these promoter elements targeted by the second messenger intracellular calcium has implications for plant signaling in response to a variety of stimuli, including cold, drought, and biotic stress.
