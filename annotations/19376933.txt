The PLETHORA (PLT) stem cell transcription factors form a developmentally instructive protein gradient in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Histone acetylation is known to facilitate gene transcription and plays an important role in developmental processes. Here, we show that histone acetyltransferase GCN5 (for general control nonderepressible 5) attenuates the PLT gradient. Based on genetic evidence, we establish that GCN5 is essential for root stem cell niche maintenance and acts in the PLT pathway. The GCN5-associated factor ADA2b (for alteration/deficiency in activation 2b) is also positioned in the PLT pathway and regulates PLT expression, similar to GCN5. Both GCN5 and ADA2b mediate proliferation of the transit amplifying cells, but ADA2b does not affect stem cell niche maintenance. Overexpression of PLT2 rescues the stem cell niche defect of gcn5 mutants, indicating that GCN5 regulation of PLT expression is essential for maintenance of the root stem cell niche. We conclude that histone acetylation complexes play an important role in shaping a developmentally instructive gradient in the root.
