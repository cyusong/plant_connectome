The calcineurin B-like (CBL)-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs), a type of plant-specific genes in the calcium signaling pathway, function in response to adverse environments. However, few halophyte derived CIPKs have been studied for their role in plant physiological and developmental adaptation during abiotic stresses, which inhibits the potential application of these genes to improve environmental adaptability of glycophytes. In this study, we constructed <i>Nitraria billardieri CIPK25</i> overexpressing <i>Arabidopsis</i> and analyzed the seedling development under salt treatment. Our results show that <i>Arabidopsis</i> with <i>NbCIPK25</i> expression exhibits more vigorous growth than wild type plants under salt condition. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying salt tolerance, we profiled the transcriptome of WT and transgenic plants <i>via</i> RNA-seq. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that upregulated genes in <i>NbCIPK25</i> overexpressing seedlings under salt stress are enriched in photosynthesis related terms; Calvin-cycle genes including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPDHs) are significantly upregulated in transgenic plants, which is consistent with a decreased level of NADPH (GAPDH substrate) and increased level of NADP<sup>+</sup>. Accordingly, <i>NbCIPK25</i> overexpressing plants exhibited more efficient photosynthesis; soluble sugar and proteins, as photosynthesis products, showed a higher accumulation in transgenic plants. These results provide molecular insight into how <i>NbCIPK25</i> promotes the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, thereby maintaining plant growth under salt stress. Our finding supports the potential application of halophyte-derived <i>NbCIPK25</i> in genetic modification for better salt adaptation.
