Developing wheat varieties with durable resistance is a core objective of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and many other breeding programs worldwide. The CIMMYT advanced wheat line "Mucuy" displayed high levels of resistance to stripe rust (YR) and leaf rust (LR) in field evaluations in Mexico and several other countries. To determine the genetic basis of YR and LR resistance, 138 F<sub>5</sub> recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross of Apav#1× Mucuy were phenotyped for YR responses from 2015 to 2020 at field sites in India, Kenya, and Mexico, and LR in Mexico. Seedling phenotyping for YR and LR responses was conducted in the greenhouse in Mexico using the same predominant races as in field trials. Using 12,681 polymorphic molecular markers from the DArT, SNP, and SSR genotyping platforms, we constructed genetic linkage maps and QTL analyses that detected seven YR and four LR resistance loci. Among these, a co-located YR/LR resistance loci was identified as <i>Yr29/Lr46</i>, and a seedling stripe rust resistance gene <i>YrMu</i> was mapped on the 2AS/2NS translocation. This fragment also conferred moderate adult plant resistance (APR) under all Mexican field environments and in one season in Kenya. Field trial phenotyping with <i>Lr37</i>-virulent <i>Puccinia triticina</i> races indicated the presence of an APR QTL accounting for 18.3-25.5% of the LR severity variation, in addition to a novel YR resistance QTL, <i>QYr.cim-3DS</i>, derived from Mucuy. We developed breeder-friendly KASP and indel molecular markers respectively for <i>Yr29</i>/<i>Lr46</i> and <i>YrMu</i>. The current study validated the presence of known genes and identified new resistance loci, a QTL combination effect, and flanking markers to facilitate accelerated breeding for genetically complex, durable rust resistance.
