The control of the potato tuber life cycle has been the subject of significant interest over many years. A number of different approaches have been adopted and data is available regarding hormonal, metabolic and gene expression changes that occur over the tuber life cycle. Despite this intense effort, no unifying model for the control of the potato tuber life cycle has emerged. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of the tuber life cycle utilising physiological, biochemical and cell-biological techniques. It has emerged that a major factor contributing to both tuber induction and dormancy break is symplastic gating which controls the allocation of resources to meristematic or vegetative tissues. Future challenges include the determination of factors regulating symplastic gating at the molecular level and the extrapolation of these findings to other systems.
