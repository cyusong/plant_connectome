Over 70% of <i>Agave</i> species, (159 of 206) are found in Mexico and are well adapted to survive under hot, arid conditions, often in marginal terrain, due to a unique combination of morphological and physiological attributes. In the pre-Columbian era agaves were also key to human adaptation to desert terrain. In contrast to other species such as cacti or resurrection plants, <i>Agaves</i> store carbohydrates in the form of fructan polymers rather than starch or sucrose, however, properties specific to fructans such as a strong hydration shell, the ability to be transported through phloem, variable composition throughout the <i>Agave</i> life-cycle and accumulation in succulent tissues and flowers suggest a potential for multiple functional roles. This mini-review summarizes current knowledge of molecular and biochemical aspects of fructan metabolism in <i>Agave</i> species.
