Plant transformation systems for creating transgenics require separate process for introducing cloned DNA into living plant cells. Identification or selection of those cells that have integrated DNA into appropriate plant genome is a vital step to regenerate fully developed plants from the transformed cells. Selectable marker genes are pivotal for the development of plant transformation technologies because marker genes allow researchers to identify or isolate the cells that are expressing the cloned DNA, to monitor and select the transformed progeny. As only a very small portion of cells are transformed in most experiments, the chances of recovering transgenic lines without selection are usually low. Since the selectable marker gene is expected to function in a range of cell types it is usually constructed as a chimeric gene using regulatory sequences that ensure constitutive expression throughout the plant. Advent of recombinant DNA technology and progress in plant molecular biology had led to a desire to introduce several genes into single transgenic plant line, necessitating the development of various types of selectable markers. This review article describes the developments made in the recent past on plant transformation systems using different selection methods adding a note on their importance as marker genes in transgenic crop plants.
