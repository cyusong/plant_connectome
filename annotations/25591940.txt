['25591940', 'Turgor pressure plays pivotal roles in the growth and movement of walled cells  that make up plants and fungi. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating  turgor pressure and the coordination between turgor pressure and cell wall  remodelling for cell growth remain poorly understood. Here, we report the  characterization of Arabidopsis TurgOr regulation Defect 1 (TOD1), which is  preferentially expressed in pollen tubes and silique guard cells. We demonstrate  that TOD1 is a Golgi-localized alkaline ceramidase. tod1 mutant pollen tubes have  higher turgor than wild type and show growth retardation both in pistils and in  agarose medium. In addition, tod1 guard cells are insensitive to abscisic acid  (ABA)-induced stomatal closure, whereas sphingosine-1-phosphate, a putative  downstream component of ABA signalling and product of alkaline ceramidases,  promotes closure in both wild type and tod1. Our data suggest that TOD1 acts in  turgor pressure regulation in both guard cells and pollen tubes.', '2015 Jan 16', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms7030', 'Yang']
