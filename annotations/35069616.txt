<i>Panax notoginseng</i> (Burk.) F. H. Chen is a Chinese medicinal plant of the Araliaceae family used for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in Asia. <i>P. notoginseng</i> is vulnerable to root rot disease, which reduces the yield of <i>P. notoginseng</i>. In this study, we analyzed the rhizosphere soil and root endophyte microbial communities of <i>P. notoginseng</i> from different geographical locations using high-throughput sequencing. Our results revealed that the <i>P. notoginseng</i> rhizosphere soil microbial community was more diverse than the root endophyte community. <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i>, <i>Actinoplanes</i>, <i>Burkholderia</i>, and <i>Variovorax paradoxus</i> can help <i>P. notoginseng</i> resist the invasion of root rot disease. <i>Ilyonectria mors-panacis</i>, <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>, and <i>Pseudopyrenochaeta lycopersici</i> are pathogenic bacteria of <i>P. notoginseng</i>. The upregulation of amino acid transport and metabolism in the soil would help to resist pathogens and improve the resistance of <i>P. notoginseng.</i> The ABC transporter and gene modulating resistance genes can improve the disease resistance of <i>P. notoginseng</i>, and the increase in the number of GTs (glycosyltransferases) and GHs (glycoside hydrolases) families may be a molecular manifestation of <i>P. notoginseng</i> root rot. In addition, the complete genomes of two <i>Flavobacteriaceae</i> species and one <i>Bacteroides</i> species were obtained. This study demonstrated the microbial and functional diversity in the rhizosphere and root microbial community of <i>P. notoginseng</i> and provided useful information for a better understanding of the microbial community in <i>P. notoginseng</i> root rot. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying <i>P. notoginseng</i> root rot and other plant rhizosphere microbial communities.
