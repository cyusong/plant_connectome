['22628555', 'Acyl acid amido synthetases of the GH3 family act as critical prereceptor  modulators of plant hormone action; however, the molecular basis for their  hormone selectivity is unclear. Here, we report the crystal structures of  benzoate-specific Arabidopsis thaliana AtGH3.12/PBS3 and jasmonic acid-specific  AtGH3.11/JAR1. These structures, combined with biochemical analysis, define  features for the conjugation of amino acids to diverse acyl acid substrates and  highlight the importance of conformational changes in the carboxyl-terminal  domain for catalysis. We also identify residues forming the acyl acid binding  site across the GH3 family and residues critical for amino acid recognition. Our  results demonstrate how a highly adaptable three-dimensional scaffold is used for  the evolution of promiscuous activity across an enzyme family for modulation of  plant signaling molecules.', '2012 Jun 29', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1221863', 'Jez']
