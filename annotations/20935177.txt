['20935177', 'Development and acclimation processes to the environment are associated with  large-scale changes in chromatin compaction in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana). Here, we studied the effects of light signals on chromatin  organization. A decrease in light intensity induces a large-scale reduction in  chromatin compaction. This low light response is reversible and shows strong  natural genetic variation. Moreover, the degree of chromatin compaction is  affected by light quality signals relevant for natural canopy shade. The  photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME2 appears a general positive regulator of low  light-induced chromatin decompaction. Phytochrome B also controls light-induced  chromatin organization, but its effect appears to be dependent on the genetic  background. We present a model in which chromatin compaction is regulated by the  light environment via CRYPTOCHROME2 protein abundance, which is controlled by  phytochrome B action.', '2010 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.164616', 'Fransz']
