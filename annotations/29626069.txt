Dioecy, the presence of male and female flowers on distinct individuals, has evolved independently in multiple plant lineages, and the genes involved in this differential development are just starting to be uncovered in a few species. Here, we used genomic approaches to investigate this pathway in kiwifruits (genus <i>Actinidia</i>). Genome-wide cataloging of male-specific subsequences, combined with transcriptome analysis, led to the identification of a type-C cytokinin response regulator as a potential sex determinant gene in this genus. Functional transgenic analyses in two model systems, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>, indicated that this gene acts as a dominant suppressor of carpel development, prompting us to name it <i>Shy Girl</i> (<i>SyGI</i>). Evolutionary analyses in a panel of <i>Actinidia</i> species revealed that <i>SyGI</i> is located in the Y-specific region of the genome and probably arose from a lineage-specific gene duplication. Comparisons with the duplicated autosomal counterpart, and with orthologs from other angiosperms, suggest that the <i>SyGI</i>-specific duplication and subsequent evolution of <i>cis</i>-elements may have played a key role in the acquisition of separate sexes in this species.
