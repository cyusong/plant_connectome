Cryptochromes (CRYs) are flavoproteins that are known as blue light photoreceptors in many organisms. Recently, genome sequences from a variety of algae became available. Functional characterizations of animal-like CRYs from Oestreococcus tauri, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Phaeodactylum tricornutum highlighted novel functions and properties. As arising from studies in fungi, certain algal CRYs of the "cryptochrome photolyase family" (PtCPF1, OtCPF1) have dual or even triple functions. They are involved in blue light perception and/or in the circadian clock and are able to repair DNA damages. On the other hand, the animal-like aCRY from C. reinhardtii is not only acting as sensory blue light- but also as sensory red light receptor thus expanding our current view of flavoproteins in general and CRYs in particular. The observed broad spectral response points to the neutral radical state of flavin, which is assumed to be the dark form in aCRY in contrast to the plant CRYs.

CRYs: !perceive! blue light 
CRYs: !repair! DNA damages 
aCRY: !perceive! blue and red light 
flavin: !assumed to be! dark form in aCRY
