Cuticles, which are composed of a variety of aliphatic molecules, impregnate epidermal cell walls forming diffusion barriers that cover almost all the aerial surfaces in higher plants. In addition to revealing important roles for cuticles in protecting plants against water loss and other environmental stresses and aggressions, mutants with permeable cuticles show major defects in plant development, such as abnormal organ formation as well as altered seed germination and viability. However, understanding the mechanistic basis for these developmental defects represents a significant challenge due to the pleiotropic nature of phenotypes and the altered physiological status/viability of some mutant backgrounds. Here we discuss both the basis of developmental phenotypes associated with defects in cuticle function and mechanisms underlying developmental processes that implicate cuticle modification. Developmental abnormalities in cuticle mutants originate at early developmental time points, when cuticle composition and properties are very difficult to measure. Nonetheless, we aim to extract principles from existing data in order to pinpoint the key cuticle components and properties required for normal plant development. Based on our analysis, we will highlight several major questions that need to be addressed and technical hurdles that need to be overcome in order to advance our current understanding of the developmental importance of plant cuticles.
