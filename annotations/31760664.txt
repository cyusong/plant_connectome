It is well known that PsbS is a key protein for the proper management of excessive energy in plants. Plants without PsbS cannot trigger non-photochemical quenching, which is crucial for optimal photosynthesis under variable conditions. Our studies showed wild-type plants had enhanced tolerance to UV-C-induced cell death (CD) upon induction of light memory by a blue or red light. However, npq4-1 plants, which lack PsbS, as well as plants overexpressing this protein (oePsbS), responded differently. Untreated oePsbS appeared more tolerant to UV-C exposure, whereas npq4-1 was unable to adequately induce cross-tolerance to UV-C. Similarly, light memory induced by episodic blue or red light was differently deregulated in npq-4 and oePsbS, as indicated by transcriptomic analyses, measurements of the trans-thylakoid pH gradient, chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, and measurements of foliar surface electrical potential. The mechanism of the foliar CD development seemed to be unaffected in the analysed plants and is associated with chloroplast breakdown. Our results suggest a novel, substantial role for PsbS as a regulator of chloroplast retrograde signalling for light memory, light acclimation, CD, and cross-tolerance to UV radiation.
