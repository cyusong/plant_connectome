Plants have evolved precise mechanisms to optimize immune responses against pathogens. ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) plays a vital role in plant innate immunity by regulating basal resistance and effector-triggered immunity. Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of EDS1 is required for resistance reinforcement, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that EDS1-INTERACTING J PROTEIN1 (EIJ1), which acts as a DnaJ protein-like chaperone in response to pathogen infection, functions as an essential negative regulator of plant immunity by interacting with EDS1. The loss-of-function mutation of EIJ1 did not affect plant growth but significantly enhanced pathogen resistance. Upon pathogen infection, EIJ1 relocalized from the chloroplast to the cytoplasm, where it interacted with EDS1, thereby restricting pathogen-triggered trafficking of EDS1 to the nucleus and compromising resistance at an early infection stage. During disease development, EIJ1 was gradually degraded, allowing the nuclear accumulation of EDS1 for transcriptional resistance reinforcement. The avirulent strain Pst DC3000 (AvrRps4) abolished the repressive action of EIJ1 by rapidly inducing its degradation in the effector-triggered immunity response. Thus, our findings show that EIJ1 is an essential EDS1-dependent negative regulator of innate plant immunity and provide a mechanistic understanding of how the nuclear versus cytoplasmic distribution of EDS1 is regulated during the immune response.
