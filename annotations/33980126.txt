A major part of the eukaryotic genome is transcribed into non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) having no protein coding potential. ncRNAs which are longer than 200 nucleotides are categorized as long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Most lncRNAs are induced as a consequence of various environmental and developmental cues. Among plants, the functions of lncRNAs are best studied in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. In this review, we highlight the important functional roles of various lncRNAs during different stages of <i>Arabidopsis</i> life cycle and their response to environmental changes. These lncRNAs primarily govern processes such as flowering, seed germination, stress response, light- and auxin-regulated development, and RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM). Major challenge is to differentiate between functional and cryptic transcripts. Genome editing, large scale RNAi and computational approaches may help to identify and characterize novel functional lncRNAs in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
