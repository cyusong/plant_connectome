Nitrogen promotes changes in SLA through metabolism and anatomical traits in Capsicum plants. Specific leaf area (SLA) is a key trait influencing light interception and light use efficiency that often impacts plant growth and production. SLA is a key trait explaining growth variations of plant species under different environments. Both light and nitrogen (N) supply are important determinants of SLA. To better understand the effect of irradiance level and N on SLA in Capsicum chinense, we evaluated primary metabolites and morphological traits of two commercial cultivars (Biquinho and Habanero) in response to changes in both parameters. Both genotypes showed increased SLA with shading, and a decrease in SLA in response to increased N supply, however, with Habanero showing a stable SLA in the range of N deficiency to sufficient N doses. Correlation analyses indicated that decreased SLA in response to higher N supply was mediated by altered amino acids, protein, and starch levels, influencing leaf density. Moreover, in the range of moderate N deficiency to N sufficiency, both genotypes exhibited differences in SLA response, with Biquinho and Habanero displaying alterations on palisade and spongy parenchyma, respectively. Altogether, the results suggest that SLA responses to N supply are modulated by the balance between certain metabolites content and genotype-dependent changes in the parenchyma cells influencing leaf thickness and density.
