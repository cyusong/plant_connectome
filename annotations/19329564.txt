['19329564', 'Peroxisomes are metabolically diverse organelles with essential roles in plant  development. The major protein constituents of plant peroxisomes are well  characterized, whereas only a few low-abundance and regulatory proteins have been  reported to date. We performed an in-depth proteome analysis of Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf peroxisomes using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis  followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. We detected 65  established plant peroxisomal proteins, 30 proteins whose association with  Arabidopsis peroxisomes had been previously demonstrated only by proteomic data,  and 55 putative novel proteins of peroxisomes. We subsequently tested the  subcellular targeting of yellow fluorescent protein fusions for selected proteins  and confirmed the peroxisomal localization for 12 proteins containing predicted  peroxisome targeting signals type 1 or 2 (PTS1/2), three proteins carrying  PTS-related peptides, and four proteins that lack conventional targeting signals.  We thereby established the tripeptides SLM> and SKV> (where > indicates the stop  codon) as new PTS1s and the nonapeptide RVx(5)HF as a putative new PTS2. The 19  peroxisomal proteins conclusively identified from this study potentially carry  out novel metabolic and regulatory functions of peroxisomes. Thus, this study  represents an important step toward defining the complete plant peroxisomal  proteome.', '2009 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.137703', 'Hu']
