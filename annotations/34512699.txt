The enzyme phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase (PRPS) catalyzes the conversion of ribose 5-phosphate into phosphoribosyl diphosphate; the latter is a precursor of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. Here, we investigated the function of PRPS from the single-celled green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> in its response to DNA damage from gamma radiation or the alkylating agent LiCl. <i>CrPRPS</i> transcripts were upregulated in cells treated with these agents. We generated <i>CrPRPS</i>-overexpressing transgenic lines to study the function of CrPRPS. When grown in culture with LiCl or exposed to gamma radiation, the transgenic cells grew faster and had a greater survival rate than wild-type cells. <i>CrPRPS</i> overexpression enhanced expression of genes associated with DNA damage response, namely <i>RAD51</i>, <i>RAD1</i>, and <i>LIG1.</i> We observed, from transcriptome analysis, upregulation of genes that code for key enzymes in purine metabolism, namely <i>ribonucleoside-diphosphate pyrophosphokinase subunit M1</i>, <i>adenylate kinase</i>, and <i>nucleoside-diphosphate kinase</i>. We conclude that <i>CrPRPS</i> may affect DNA repair process via regulation of <i>de novo</i> nucleotide synthesis.
