['19631646', 'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) is the key enzyme of the oxidative  pentose phosphate pathway supplying reducing power (as NADPH) in  non-photosynthesizing cells. We have examined in detail the redox regulation of  the plastidial isoform predominantly present in Arabidopsis green tissues  (AtG6PDH1) and found that its oxidative activation is strictly dependent on  plastidial thioredoxins (Trxs) that show differential efficiencies. Light/dark  modulation of AtG6PDH1 was reproduced in vitro in a reconstituted ferredoxin/Trx  system using f-type Trx allowing to propose a new function for this Trx isoform  co-ordinating both reductive (Calvin cycle) and oxidative pentose phosphate  pathways.', '2009 Sep 3', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2009.07.035', 'Issakidis-Bourguet']
