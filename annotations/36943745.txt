In the anthers and ovaries of flowers, pollen grains and embryo sacs are produced with uniform cell compositions. This stable gametogenesis enables elaborate interactions between male and female gametophytes after pollination, forming the highly successful sexual reproduction system in flowering plants. As most ovules are fertilized with a single pollen tube, the resulting genome set in the embryo and endosperm is determined in a single pattern by independent fertilization of the egg cell and central cell by two sperm cells. However, if ovules receive four sperm cells from two pollen tubes, the expected options for genome sets in the developing seeds would more than double. In wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana plants, around 5% of ovules receive two pollen tubes. Recent studies have elucidated the abnormal fertilization in supernumerary pollen tubes and sperm cells related to polytubey, polyspermy, heterofertilization, and fertilization recovery. Analyses of model plants have begun to uncover the mechanisms underlying this new pollen tube biology. Here, we review unusual fertilization phenomena and propose several breeding applications for flowering plants. These arguments contribute to the remodeling of plant reproduction, a challenging concept that alters typical plant fertilization by utilizing the current genetic toolbox.
