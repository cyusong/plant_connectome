['30498218', 'In plants, hyperosmolality stimuli triggers opening of the osmosensitive  channels, leading to a rapid downstream signaling cascade initiated by cytosolic  calcium concentration elevation. Members of the OSCA family in Arabidopsis  thaliana, identified as the hyperosmolality-gated calcium-permeable channels,  have been suggested to play a key role during the initial phase of hyperosmotic  stress response. Here, we report the atomic structure of Arabidopsis OSCA1.2  determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. It contains 11  transmembrane helices and forms a homodimer. It is in an inactivated state, and  the pore-lining residues are clearly identified. Its cytosolic domain contains a  RNA recognition motif and two unique long helices. The linker between these two  helices forms an anchor in the lipid bilayer and may be essential to osmosensing.  The structure of AtOSCA1.2 serves as a platform for the study of the mechanism  underlying osmotic stress responses and mechanosensing.', '2018 Nov 29', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-018-07564-5', 'Sun']
