During their lifetime, plants are frequently exposed to a variety of stresses which negatively impact on growth and vitality. In order to respond specifically to a given stress situation, integration of multiple signal inputs is of utmost importance. Recently, we demonstrated that recognition and adaptation to low-oxygen stress requires integration of signals from energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and oxygen availability. Low oxygen which results in an energy crisis causes a shift in lipid intermediate ratios. Binding of C18:1-CoA by ACYL-COA BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ACBP1) at the plasma membrane concomitantly leads to release and nuclear accumulation of the ERFVII transcription factor RELATED TO APETALA 2.12 (RAP2.12) which is central to the activation of anaerobic metabolism during stress. Moreover, RAP2.12 protein stability is oxygen-dependently regulated and its oxidation results in degradation by the N-end rule pathway. Here, we illuminate the concept of multiple-signal integration under hypoxia and discuss signal inputs merging at the ACBP1-ERFVII signaling hub.
