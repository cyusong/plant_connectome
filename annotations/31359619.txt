Leaf shape has important implications for optimizing plant architecture for grain crops and horticultural crops. Examination of the cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) round leaf (rl) mutant by Song et al. (2019) revealed that the PINOID protein kinase affects leaf shape by altering auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling.
