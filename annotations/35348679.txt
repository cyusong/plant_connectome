The moss Physcomitrium (previously Physcomitrella) patens is a non-vascular plant belonging to the bryophytes that has been used as a model species to study the evolution of plant cell wall structure and biosynthesis. Here, we present an updated review of the cell wall biology of P. patens. Immunocytochemical and structural studies have shown that the cell walls of P. patens mainly contain cellulose, hemicelluloses (xyloglucan, xylan, glucomannan, and arabinoglucan), pectin, and glycoproteins, and their abundance varies among different cell types and at different plant developmental stages. Genetic and biochemical analyses have revealed that a number of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis are functionally conserved between P. patens and vascular plants, indicating that the common ancestor of mosses and vascular plants had already acquired most of the biosynthetic machinery to make various cell wall polymers. Although P. patens does not synthesize lignin, homologs of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway genes exist in P. patens and they play an essential role in the production of caffeate derivatives for cuticle formation. Further genetic and biochemical dissection of cell wall biosynthetic genes in P. patens promises to provide additional insights into the evolutionary history of plant cell wall structure and biosynthesis.
