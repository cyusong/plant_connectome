In the present manuscript, we report on the proteolytic enzymes acting in the Araucaria bidwillii megagametophyte throughout seed germination. At seed maturity the megagametophyte contains a bulk of reserves for the growing embryo, thus representing the major storage tissue of the bunya pine seed. Soon after seed germination the megagametophyte undergoes storage protein mobilization, degenerating as a no longer needed tissue by the late germinative stages. By using in-solution and in-gel assays, and mass spectrometric analyses we detected exopeptidases and proteinases differently active in this tissue at selected germinative stages, and obtained preliminary data on the nature of an endopeptidase active at the late stages. Early germination stages were characterized by aminopeptidase and aspartic, metallo and cysteine proteinase activities; carboxypeptidases and serine proteinases became highly active by the late stages. Partial sequencing of a protein responsible for late stage serine peptidase activity sensitive to the caspase-6 inhibitor, showed a set of amino acid sequences with various degrees of identity with various plant subtilisin-like serine proteinases. The participation of the early stage proteases in the storage protein mobilization and the involvement of the late stage proteases in the megagametophyte cell death are proposed and discussed.
