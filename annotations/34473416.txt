The evolution of seeds is a major reason why flowering plants are a dominant life form on Earth. The developing seed is composed of two fertilization products, the embryo and endosperm, which are surrounded by a maternally derived seed coat. Accumulating evidence indicates that efficient communication among all three seed components is required to ensure coordinated seed development. Cell communication within plant seeds has drawn much attention in recent years. In this study, we review current knowledge of cross-talk among the endosperm, embryo, and seed coat during seed development, and highlight recent advances in this field.
