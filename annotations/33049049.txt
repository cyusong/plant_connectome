Gibberellins (GAs) play key roles in various developmental processes in land plants. We studied the evolutionary trends of GA metabolic enzymes through a comprehensive homology search and phylogenetic analyses from bryophytes to angiosperms. Our analyses suggest that, in the process of evolution, plants were able to acquire GA metabolic enzymes in a stepwise manner and that the enzymes had rapidly diversified in angiosperms. As a good example of their rapid diversification, we focused on the GA-deactivating enzyme, GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox). Although the establishment of a GA system first occurred in lycophytes, its inactivation system mediated by GA2oxs was established at a much later time: the rise of gymnosperms and the rise of angiosperms through C19-GA2ox and C20-GA2ox development, respectively, as supported by the results of our direct examination of their enzymatic activities in vitro. Based on these comprehensive studies of GA metabolic enzymes, we discuss here that angiosperms rapidly developed a sophisticated system to delicately control the level of active GAs by increasing their copy numbers for their survival under different challenging environments.
