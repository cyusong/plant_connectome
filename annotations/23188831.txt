MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) are important regulators of the activation levels and kinetics of MAP kinases. This is crucial for a large number of physiological processes during development and growth, as well as interactions with the environment, including the response to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) stress. Arabidopsis MKP1 is a key regulator of MAP kinases MPK3 and MPK6 in response to UV-B stress. However, virtually nothing is presently known about the post-translational regulation of plant MKPs in vivo. Here, we provide evidence that MKP1 is a phosphoprotein in vivo and that MKP1 accumulates in response to UV-B stress. Moreover, proteasome inhibitor experiments suggest that MKP1 is constantly turned-over under non-stress conditions and that MKP1 is stabilized upon stress treatment. Stress-responsive phosphorylation and stabilization of MKP1 demonstrate the post-translational regulation of a plant MKP in vivo, adding an additional regulatory layer to MAP kinase signaling in plants.
