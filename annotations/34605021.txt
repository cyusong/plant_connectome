Sessile plants constantly experience environmental stresses in nature. They must have evolved effective mechanisms to balance growth with stress response. Here we report the MADS-box transcription factor AGL16 acting as a negative regulator in stress response in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-AGL16 confers resistance to salt stress in seed germination, root elongation and soil-grown plants, while elevated AGL16 expression confers the opposite phenotypes compared with wild-type. However, the sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) in seed germination is inversely correlated with AGL16 expression levels. Transcriptomic comparison revealed that the improved salt resistance of agl16 mutants was largely attributed to enhanced expression of stress-responsive transcriptional factors and the genes involved in ABA signalling and ion homeostasis. We further demonstrated that AGL16 directly binds to the CArG motifs in the promoter of HKT1;1, HsfA6a and MYB102 and represses their expression. Genetic analyses with double mutants also support that HsfA6a and MYB102 are target genes of AGL16. Taken together, our results show that AGL16 acts as a negative regulator transcriptionally suppressing key components in the stress response and may play a role in balancing stress response with growth.
