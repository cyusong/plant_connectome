In our article published in Plant Physiology, we had reported <i>tarani</i> (<i>tni</i>) mutant in Arabidopsis, in which poly-ubiquitin hydrolysis is adversely affected, shows pleiotropic phenotypic defects including fewer lateral roots due to the stabilization of several AUX/IAAs and reduced auxin response. <i>TNI</i> encodes UBIQUITIN-SPECIFIC PROTEASE14 that maintains normal auxin response through ubiquitin recycling. Fewer lateral roots observed in <i>tni</i> could be due to defects in their primordia initiation or subsequent elongation post-initiation. Here we have tested this by marking the lateral root primordia with <i>pCycB1;1::CycB1;1(DB):GUS</i> reporter and counting the number of lateral root at various stages development of as a marker of lateral root primordium. The results suggest that TNI/UBP14 is required for LRP development, and a reduction in TNI activity causes a delay in LRP initiation and consequently shorter lateral roots in the <i>tni</i> seedlings. <b>ABBREVIATIONS</b>: LRP, lateral root primordium; XPP, xylem pole pericycle; LRFC, lateral root founder cells.
