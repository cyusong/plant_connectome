The phytohormone cytokinin is a key player in many developmental processes and in the response of plants to biotic and abiotic stress. The cytokinin signal is perceived and transduced via a multistep variant of the bacterial two-component signaling system. Most of the research on cytokinin signaling has been done in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Research on cytokinin signaling has expanded to a much broader range of plants species in recent years. This is due to the natural limitation of Arabidopsis as a model species for the investigation of processes like nodulation or wood formation. The rapidly increasing number of sequenced plant genomes also facilitates the use of other species in this line of research. This review summarizes what is known about the cytokinin signaling in the different organisms and highlights differences to Arabidopsis.
