Understanding the mechanisms by which chlorophylls are synthesized in the eggplant (<i>Solanum melongena</i>) fruit peel is of great relevance for eggplant breeding. A multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population and a germplasm collection have been screened for green pigmentation in the fruit peel and used to identify candidate genes for this trait. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed with 420 MAGIC individuals revealed a major association on chromosome 8 close to a gene similar to <i>APRR2</i>. Two variants in <i>SmAPRR2</i>, predicted as having a high impact effect, were associated with the absence of fruit chlorophyll pigmentation in the MAGIC population, and a large deletion of 5.27 kb was found in two reference genomes of accessions without chlorophyll in the fruit peel. The validation of the candidate gene <i>SmAPRR2</i> was performed by its sequencing in a set of MAGIC individuals and through its <i>de novo</i> assembly in 277 accessions from the G2P-SOL eggplant core collection. Two additional mutations in <i>SmAPRR2</i> associated with the lack of chlorophyll were identified in the core collection set. The phylogenetic analysis of <i>APRR2</i> reveals orthology within Solanaceae and suggests that specialization of <i>APRR2-like</i> genes occurred independently in Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae. A strong geographical differentiation was observed in the frequency of predominant mutations in <i>SmAPRR2</i>, resulting in a lack of fruit chlorophyll pigmentation and suggesting that this phenotype may have arisen and been selected independently several times. This study represents the first identification of a major gene for fruit chlorophyll pigmentation in the eggplant fruit.
