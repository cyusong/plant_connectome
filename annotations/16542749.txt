The role of ABA in the modification of membrane proton pump activity in cucumber roots which had been stressed for 24h with 200 mmol/dm(3) NaCl was investigated. It was shown that treatment of plants with salt distinctly increased the activity of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.3.6) as well as of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.3.14). In roots treated with NaCl, an increase of ABA level was observed. Moreover, 24-h treatment of seedlings with 50 micro mol/dm(3) ABA increased the activity of proton pumps in both membranes. However, when ABA was added to the reaction medium, no changes in ATPase activities were observed. The increased H(+)-ATPase activity in plasma membranes isolated from the ABA-treated roots was positively correlated with a higher level of PM-H(+)-ATPase transcript. These data have provided evidence that under salt stress conditions, the role of ABA action due to salinity on the induction of the PM-H(+)-ATPase could be at the level of gene expression.

NaCl: !increases! ABA level 
ABA: !increases! H+-ATPase activity 
ABA: !induces! PM-H+-ATPase transcript
