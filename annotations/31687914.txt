Although the influence of microbiomes on the health of plant hosts is evident, specific mechanisms shaping the structure and dynamics of microbial communities in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere are only beginning to become clear. Traditionally, plant-microbe interactions have been studied using cultured microbial isolates and plant hosts but the rising use of 'omics tools provides novel snapshots of the total complex community in situ. Here, we discuss the recent advances in tools and techniques used to monitor plant-microbe interactions and the chemical signals that influence these relationships in above- and belowground tissues. Particularly, we highlight advances in integrated microscopy that allow observation of the chemical exchange between individual plant and microbial cells, as well as high-throughput, culture-independent approaches to investigate the total genetic and metabolic contribution of the community. The chemicals discussed have been identified as relevant signals across experimental spectrums. However, mechanistic insight into the specific interactions mediated by many of these chemicals requires further testing. Experimental designs that attempt to bridge the gap in biotic complexity between single strains and whole communities will advance our understanding of the chemical signals governing plant-microbe associations in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere.
