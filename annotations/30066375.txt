As a major component of soil organic phosphorus (P), phytate-P is unavailable to plants unless hydrolysed by phytase to release inorganic phosphate. However, knowledge on natural variation in root-associated phytase activity and its underlying molecular mechanisms in plants remains fragmentary. In this study, variations in root internal and associated phytase activity were observed among 39 genotypes of Stylosanthes guianensis (Stylo), which is well adapted to acid soils. Furthermore, TPRC2001-1, the genotype with the highest root-associated phytase activity, was more capable of utilizing extracellular phytate-P than Fine-stem, the genotype with the lowest root-associated phytase activity. After protein liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, a purple acid phosphatase (PAP), SgPAP23, was identified and cloned from TPRC2001-1. SgPAP23 exhibited high activity against phytate-P and was mainly localized on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, SgPAP23 overexpression resulted in significant increases of root-associated phytase activity and thus facilitated extracellular phytate-P utilization in both bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) hairy roots and Arabidopsis thaliana. The results herein support the conclusion that SgPAP23 is a primary contributor to the superior extracellular phytate-P utilization in stylo and thus is used to develop cultivars with efficient extracellular phytate-P utilization.
