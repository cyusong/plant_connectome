['30992454', 'Seed germination and photoautotrophic establishment are controlled by the  antagonistic activity of the phytohormones gibberellins (GAs) and abscisic acid  (ABA). Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana GAS2 (Gain of Function in  ABA-modulated Seed Germination 2), a protein belonging to the Fe-dependent  2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase superfamily, catalyzes the stereospecific hydration of  GA(12) to produce GA(12) 16, 17-dihydro-16alpha-ol (DHGA(12)). We show that DHGA(12),  a C(20)-GA has an atypical structure compared to known active GAs but can bind to  the GA receptor (GID1c). DHGA(12) can promote seed germination, hypocotyl  elongation and cotyledon greening. Silencing and over-expression of GAS2 alters  the ABA/GA ratio and sensitivity to ABA during seed germination and  photoautotrophic establishment. Hence, we propose that GAS2 acts to modulate  hormonal balance during early seedling development.', '2019 Apr 16', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-019-09467-5', 'ORCID:']
