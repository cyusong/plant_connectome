['25843888', 'Cell polarization is linked to fate determination during asymmetric division of  plant stem cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In  Arabidopsis, BREAKING OF ASYMMETRY IN THE STOMATAL LINEAGE (BASL) is polarized to  control stomatal asymmetric division. A mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)  cascade determines terminal stomatal fate by promoting the degradation of the  lineage determinant SPEECHLESS (SPCH). Here, we demonstrate that a  positive-feedback loop between BASL and the MAPK pathway constitutes a polarity  module at the cortex. Cortical localization of BASL requires phosphorylation  mediated by MPK3/6. Phosphorylated BASL functions as a scaffold and recruits the  MAPKKK YODA and MPK3/6 to spatially concentrate signaling at the cortex.  Activated MPK3/6 reinforces the feedback loop by phosphorylating BASL and  inhibits stomatal fate by phosphorylating SPCH. Polarization of the BASL-MAPK  signaling feedback module represents a mechanism connecting cell polarity to fate  differentiation during asymmetric stem cell division in plants.', '2015 Apr 20', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2015.02.022', 'Dong']
