Changes in the activity of catalase (Cat) and in the levels of H2O2 were followed throughout dormancy in buds of grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.). In grapevines grown in the Elqui valley in Chile, a region with warm-winters, the activity of Cat increased during the recess period of buds, reaching a maximum and thereafter decreased to less than one third of its maximal activity. Three isoforms of Cat were detected in extracts of buds by native PAGE analysis, and the extracted activity was inhibited competitively by hydrogen cyanamide (HC), a potent bud-break agent. Furthermore, HC applications to field-grown grapevines in addition to the expected effect on advancing bud break, reduced the Cat activity during bud dormancy. Similar reductions were observed during dormancy in buds of grapevines grown in the Central valley in Chile, a region with temperate winters, suggesting that HC and winter chilling inhibits the activity of the main H2O2 degrading enzyme in grape buds. A transient rise in H2O2 levels preceded the release of buds from endodormancy, moreover, the peak of H2O2 and the onset of bud break occurred earlier in HC treated than in control grapevines, suggesting the participation of H2O2 as a signal molecule in the release of endodormancy in grape buds. The relationship between Cat inhibition, rise in H2O2 levels and initiation of bud break are discussed.

HC: !inhibits! Cat activity
H2O2: !rises before! bud break
HC: !advances! bud break
Cat: !degrades! H2O2
