Phenological studies often focus on relationships between flowering date and temperature or other environmental variables. Yet in species that preform flowers, anthesis is one stage of a lengthy developmental process, and effects of temperature on flower development in the year(s) before flowering are largely unknown. We investigated the effects of temperature during preformation on flower development in Vaccinium vitis-idaea. Using scanning electron microscopy, we established scores for developing primordia and examined effects of air temperature, depth of soil thaw, time of year and previous stage on development. Onset of flower initiation depends on soil thaw, and developmental change is greatest at early stages and during the warmest months. Regardless of temperature and time during the season, all basal floral primordia pause development at the same stage before whole-plant dormancy. Once primordia are initiated, development does not appear to be influenced by air temperature differences within the range of variation among our sites. There may be strong endogenous flower-level controls over development, particularly the stage at which morphogenesis ceases before dormancy. However, the strength of such internal controls in the face of continuing temperature extremes under a changing climate is unclear.
