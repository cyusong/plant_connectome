['15749712', 'Selective modification of proteins by ubiquitination is directed by diverse  families of ubiquitin-protein ligases (or E3s). A large collection of E3s use  Cullins (CULs) as scaffolds to form multisubunit E3 complexes in which the CUL  binds a target recognition subcomplex and the RBX1 docking protein, which  delivers the activated ubiquitin moiety. Arabidopsis and rice contain a large  collection of CUL isoforms, indicating that multiple CUL-based E3s exist in  plants. Here we show that Arabidopsis CUL3a and CUL3b associate with RBX1 and  members of the broad complex/tramtrack/bric-a-brac (BTB) protein family to form  BTB E3s. Eighty genes encoding BTB domain-containing proteins were identified in  the Arabidopsis genome, indicating that a diverse array of BTB E3s is possible.  In addition to the BTB domain, the encoded proteins also contain various other  interaction motifs that likely serve as target recognition elements. DNA  microarray analyses show that BTB genes are expressed widely in the plant and  that tissue-specific and isoform-specific patterns exist. Arabidopsis defective  in both CUL3a and CUL3b are embryo-lethal, indicating that BTB E3s are essential  for plant development.', '2005 May 13', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M413247200', 'Vierstra']
