One model of a disease-suppressive soil predicts that the confrontation of plant with a phytopathogen can lead to the recruitment and accumulation of beneficial microorganisms. However, more information needs to be deciphered regarding which beneficial microbes become enriched, and how the disease suppression is achieved. Here, we conditioned soil by continuously growing eight generations of cucumber inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cucumerinum in a split-root system. Disease incidence was found to decrease gradually upon pathogen infection accompanied with higher quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS mainly OH<sup>•</sup> ) in roots and accumulation of Bacillus and Sphingomonas. These key microbes were proven to protect the cucumber from pathogen infection by inducing high ROS level in the roots through enrichment of pathways, including a two-component system, a bacterial secretion system, and flagellar assembly revealed by metagenomics sequencing. Untargeted metabolomics analysis combined with in vitro application assays suggested that threonic acid and lysine were pivotal to recruit Bacillus and Sphingomonas. Collectively, our study deciphered a 'cry for help' case, wherein cucumber releases particular compounds to enrich beneficial microbes that raise the ROS level of host to prevent pathogen attack. More importantly, this may be one of the fundamental mechanisms underpinning disease-suppressive soil formation.

Cucumber: !releases! threonic acid and lysine 
threonic acid and lysine: !recruit! Bacillus and Sphingomonas 
Bacillus and Sphingomonas: !induce! high ROS level in roots 
high ROS level: !protects! cucumber from pathogen attack
