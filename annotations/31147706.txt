Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is a C4 crop known to be adaptable to harsh environments such as those under high temperature and water deficit. In this study, we focused on a Japanese sorghum landrace Takakibi (NOG) and employed chlorophyll fluorescence measurements to assess its response to environmental stress. Comparison of photosynthetic rate evaluated using two parameters (effective quantum yield and electron transfer rate) indicated that NOG showed less activity than BTx623 in the pre-flowering stage, which was consistent with the higher susceptibility of NOG seedlings to drought than BTx623. The observed differences in photosynthetic activity between the two cultivars were detectable without drought conditions on days with high temperature and strong light. Interestingly, the photosynthetic activity of NOG leaves in stress conditions increased soon after heading, and the trend was similar to that in BTx642, a well-characterized post-flowering drought-tolerant cultivar. In contrast, BTx623 showed a gradual decline in photosynthetic rate. Thus, we inferred that Japanese Takakibi has the potential to show pre-flowering drought susceptibility and post-flowering drought tolerance, through which it adapts to local climates with high temperature and strong light at harvest.
