['23512854', "In most plant cell types, the chloroplast represents the largest sink for iron,  which is both essential for chloroplast metabolism and prone to cause oxidative  damage. Here, we show that to buffer the potentially harmful effects of iron,  besides ferritins for storage, the chloroplast is equipped with specific iron  transporters that respond to iron toxicity by removing iron from the chloroplast.  We describe two transporters of the YELLOW STRIPE1-LIKE family from Arabidopsis  thaliana, YSL4 and YSL6, which are likely to fulfill this function. Knocking out  both YSL4 and YSL6 greatly reduces the plant's ability to cope with excess iron.  Biochemical and immunolocalization analyses showed that YSL6 resides in the  chloroplast envelope. Elemental analysis and histochemical staining indicate that  iron is trapped in the chloroplasts of the ysl4 ysl6 double mutants, which also  accumulate ferritins. Also, vacuolar iron remobilization and NRAMP3/4 expression  are inhibited. Furthermore, ubiquitous expression of YSL4 or YSL6 dramatically  reduces plant tolerance to iron deficiency and decreases chloroplastic iron  content. These data demonstrate a fundamental role for YSL4 and YSL6 in managing  chloroplastic iron. YSL4 and YSL6 expression patterns support their physiological  role in detoxifying iron during plastid dedifferentiation occurring in  embryogenesis and senescence.", '2013 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.107672', 'Curie']
