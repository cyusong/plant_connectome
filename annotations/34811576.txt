The Ve-resistance locus in tomato acts as a resilience gene by affecting both the stress/defense cascade and growth, constituting a signaling intercept with a competitive regulatory mechanism. For decades, the tomato Ve-gene has been recognized as a classical resistance R-gene, inherited as a dominant Mendelian trait and encoding a receptor protein that binds with a fungal effector to provide defense against Verticillium dahliae and V. albo-atrum. However, recent molecular studies suggest that the function and role(s) of the Ve-locus and the two proteins that it encodes are more complex than previously understood. This review summarizes both the background and recent molecular evidence and provides a reinterpretation of the function and role(s) of the Ve1- and Ve2-genes and proteins that better accommodates existing data. It is proposed that these two plasma membrane proteins interact to form a signaling intercept that directly links defense and growth. The induction of Ve1 by infection or wounding promotes growth but also downregulates Ve2 signaling, resulting in a decreased biosynthesis of PR proteins. In this context, the Ve1 R-gene acts as a Resilience gene rather than a Resistance gene, promoting taller more robust tomato plants with reduced symptoms (biotic and abiotic) and Verticillium concentration.
