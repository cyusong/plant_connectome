Drought is the main abiotic stress constraining sugarcane production. However, our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the drought stress responses of sugarcane impairs the development of new technologies to increase sugarcane drought tolerance. Here, an integrated approach was performed to reveal the molecular and physiological changes in two closely related sugarcane cultivars, including the most extensively planted cultivar in Brazil (cv. RB867515), in response to moderate (-0.5 MPa) and severe (-1 MPa) drought stress at the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels. The results show common and cultivar exclusive changes in specific genes related to photosynthesis, carbohydrate, amino acid, and phytohormone metabolism. The novel phosphoproteomics and redox proteomic analysis revealed the importance of posttranslational regulation mechanisms during sugarcane drought stress. The shift to soluble sugar, secondary metabolite production, and activation of ROS eliminating processes in response to drought tolerance were mechanisms exclusive to cv. RB867515, helping to explain the better performance and higher production of this cultivar under these stress conditions.
