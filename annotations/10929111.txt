['10929111', 'To investigate the uptake and long-distance translocation of sulphate in plants,  we have characterized three cell-type-specific sulphate transporters, Sultr1;1,  Sultr2;1 and Sultr2;2 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Heterologous expression in the  yeast sulphate transporter mutant indicated that Sultr1;1 encodes a high-affinity  sulphate transporter (Km for sulphate 3.6 +/- 0.6 microM), whereas Sultr2;1 and  Sultr2;2 encode low-affinity sulphate transporters (Km for sulphate 0.41 +/- 0.07  mM and >/= 1.2 mM, respectively). In Arabidopsis plants expressing the fusion  gene construct of the Sultr1;1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP), GFP  was localized in the lateral root cap, root hairs, epidermis and cortex of roots.  beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expressed with the Sultr2;1 promoter was specifically  accumulated in the xylem parenchyma cells of roots and leaves, and in the root  pericycles and leaf phloem. Expression of the Sultr2;2 promoter-GFP fusion gene  showed specific localization of GFP in the root phloem and leaf vascular bundle  sheath cells. Plants continuously grown with low sulphate concentrations  accumulated high levels of Sultr1;1 and Sultr2;1 mRNA in roots and Sultr2;2 mRNA  in leaves. The abundance of Sultr1;1 and Sultr2;1 mRNA was increased remarkably  in roots by short-term stress caused by withdrawal of sulphate. Addition of  selenate in the sulphate-sufficient medium increased the sulphate uptake  capacity, tissue sulphate content and the abundance of Sultr1;1 and Sultr2;1 mRNA  in roots. Concomitant decrease of the tissue thiol content after selenate  treatment was consistent with the suggested role of glutathione (GSH) as a  repressive effector for the expression of sulphate transporter genes.', '2000 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00768.x', 'Saito']
