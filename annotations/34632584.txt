The hypersensitive response (HR) is a robust immune response mediated by nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs). However, the early molecular event that links activated NLRs to cell death is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that NLRs target plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup> -ATPases (PMAs) that generate electrochemical potential, an essential component of living cells, across the plasma membrane. CC<sup>A</sup> 309, an autoactive N-terminal domain of a coiled-coil NLR (CNL) in pepper, is associated with PMAs. Silencing or overexpression of PMAs reversibly affects cell death induced by CC<sup>A</sup> 309 in Nicotiana benthamiana. CC<sup>A</sup> 309-induced extracellular alkalization causes plasma membrane depolarization, followed by cell death. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses suggest that CC<sup>A</sup> 309 inhibits PMA activation by preoccupying the dephosphorylated penultimate threonine residue of PMA. Moreover, pharmacological experiments using fusicoccin, an irreversible PMA activator, showed that inhibition of PMAs contributes to CNL-type (but not Toll interleukin-1 receptor NLR-type) resistance protein-induced cell death. We suggest PMAs as primary targets of plasma membrane-associated CNLs leading to HR-associated cell death by disturbing the electrochemical gradient across the membrane. These results provide new insight into NLR-mediated cell death in plants, as well as innate immunity in higher eukaryotes.
