Members of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN1 (DRP1) family are required for cytokinesis and cell expansion. Two isoforms, DRP1A and DRP1C, are required for plasma membrane maintenance during stigmatic papillae expansion and pollen development, respectively. It is unknown whether the DRP1s function interchangeably or if they have distinct roles during cell division and expansion. DRP1C was previously shown to form dynamic foci in the cell cortex, which colocalize with part of the clathrin endocytic machinery in plants. DRP1A localizes to the plasma membrane, but its cortical organization and dynamics have not been determined. Using dual color labeling with live cell imaging techniques, we showed that DRP1A also forms discreet dynamic foci in the epidermal cell cortex. Although the foci overlap with those formed by DRP1C and clathrin light chain, there are clear differences in behavior and response to pharmacological inhibitors between DRP1A and DRP1C foci. Possible functional or regulatory differences between DRP1A and DRP1C were supported by the failure of DRP1C to functionally compensate for the absence of DRP1A. Our studies indicated that the DRP1 isoforms function or are regulated differently during cell expansion.
