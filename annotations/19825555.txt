Programmed cell death (PCD) is a central regulatory process in both plant development and in plant responses to pathogens. PCD requires a coordinate activation of pro-apoptotic factors such as proteases and suppressors inhibiting and modulating these processes. In plants, various caspase-like cysteine proteases as well as serine proteases have been implicated in PCD. Here, we show that a serine protease (Kunitz trypsin) inhibitor (KTI1) of Arabidopsis acts as a functional KTI when produced in bacteria and in planta. Expression of AtKTI1 is induced late in response to bacterial and fungal elicitors and to salicylic acid. RNAi silencing of the AtKTI1 gene results in enhanced lesion development after infiltration of leaf tissue with the PCD-eliciting fungal toxin fumonisin B1 (FB1) or the avirulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 carrying avrB (Pst avrB). Overexpression of AtKTI1 results in reduced lesion development after Pst avrB and FB1 infiltration. Interestingly, RNAi silencing of AtKTI1 leads to enhanced resistance to the virulent pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora SCC1, while overexpression of AtKTI1 leads to higher susceptibility towards this pathogen. Together, these data indicate that AtKTI1 is involved in modulating PCD in plant-pathogen interactions.
