The present study aimed to evaluate the possible relationship between the changes in hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and nitric oxide (NO) content and the course of growth and reproductive processes of the cell cycle of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The peak of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> observed at the beginning of the cell cycle was found to originate from Fe-SOD and Mn-SOD<sub>chl.</sub> activity and result from the alternation in the photosynthetic processes caused by the dark-to-light transition of daughter cells. A rapid increase in NO concentration, observed before the light-to-dark cell transition, originated from NR and NIR activity and was followed by a photosynthesis-independent, Mn-SOD<sub>chl.</sub>-mediated increases in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. This H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> peak overlapped the beginning of Chlamydomonas cell division, which was indicated by a profile of CYCs and CDKs characteristic of cells' passage through the G1/S and S/M checkpoints. Taken together, our results show that there is a clear relationship between the course of the Chlamydomonas cell cycle and typical changes in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/NO ratio, as well as changes in expression and activity of enzymes involved in generation and scavenging of these signaling molecules.
