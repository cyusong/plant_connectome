['21734647', 'The plant hormone auxin is thought to provide positional information for  patterning during development. It is still unclear, however, precisely how auxin  is distributed across tissues and how the hormone is sensed in space and time.  The control of gene expression in response to auxin involves a complex network of  over 50 potentially interacting transcriptional activators and repressors, the  auxin response factors (ARFs) and Aux/IAAs. Here, we perform a large-scale  analysis of the Aux/IAA-ARF pathway in the shoot apex of Arabidopsis, where  dynamic auxin-based patterning controls organogenesis. A comprehensive expression  map and full interactome uncovered an unexpectedly simple distribution and  structure of this pathway in the shoot apex. A mathematical model of the  Aux/IAA-ARF network predicted a strong buffering capacity along with spatial  differences in auxin sensitivity. We then tested and confirmed these predictions  using a novel auxin signalling sensor that reports input into the signalling  pathway, in conjunction with the published DR5 transcriptional output reporter.  Our results provide evidence that the auxin signalling network is essential to  create robust patterns at the shoot apex.', '2011 Jul 5', 'Mol Syst Biol', '10.1038/msb.2011.39', 'Traas']
