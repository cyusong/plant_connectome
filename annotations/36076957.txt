The dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (DREB) is a subgroup member of the AP2/ERF family and actively participates in the response of plants to abiotic stress. Although <i>DREB</i> genes have been studied in a variety of plant species, there are few reports of <i>DREB</i> genes in sugarcane (<i>Saccharum</i> spp.). In this study, a novel full-length cDNA sequence of the <i>ScDREB2B-1</i> gene was cloned from the <i>Saccharum</i> hybrid ROC22, whose encoding protein contained only one AP2-conserved domain and was clustered into the DREB (A-2) subgroup. The diverse promoter elements in the <i>ScDREB2B-1</i> gene and the accumulated transcripts of its homologous gene (<i>SsAP2/ERF-107</i>) in <i>S. spontaneum</i> under drought stress suggest that the <i>ScDREB2B-1</i> gene may play a role in drought response. In addition, reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis showed that the expression level of the <i>ScDREB2B-1</i> gene was upregulated in the root and leaf of ROC22 under polyethylene glycol, sodium chloride and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. The yeast two-hybrid experiment demonstrated that ScDREB2B-1 had transcriptional self-activation activity. Compared with wild-type plants, the overexpression of the <i>ScDREB2B-1</i> gene improved the drought tolerance of the transgenic <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> by activating the ABA pathway to enhance the expression of the ABA-responsive gene (<i>NbNCED</i>) and ABA content, regulate the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level (enhance the transcripts of ROS synthase-related gene <i>NbRbohB</i> and the activities of catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) and increase the relative water content, proline content and expression level of osmotic stress-related genes (<i>NbERD</i> and <i>NbLEA</i>). Collectively, our data indicate that <i>ScDREB2B-1</i> is a stress-inducible and ABA-responsive transcription factor gene that responds to drought stress by regulating ABA signaling, ROS levels and stress-related gene expression. This study contributes to a better understanding of the biological function of <i>ScDREB2B-1</i>, which could serve as a foundation for future resistance breeding in sugarcane.
