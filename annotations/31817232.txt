NAC (NAM (no apical meristem), ATAF1/2, and CUC2 (cup-shaped cotyledon)) proteins are one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors, and this family is present in a wide range of land plants. Here, we have investigated the role of <i>ANAC046</i> in the regulation of suberin biosynthesis and deposition in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Subcellular localization and transcriptional activity assays showed that <i>ANAC046</i> localizes in the nucleus, where it functions as a transcription activator. Analysis of the P<sub>ANAC046</sub>:GUS lines revealed that <i>ANAC046</i> is mainly expressed in the root endodermis and periderm, and is also induced in leaves by wounding. The transgenic lines overexpressing <i>ANAC046</i> exhibited defective surfaces on the aerial plant parts compared to the wild-type (WT) as characterized by increased permeability for Toluidine blue stain and greater chlorophyll leaching. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of suberin biosynthesis genes was significantly higher in the roots and leaves of overexpression lines compared to the WT. The biochemical analysis of leaf cuticular waxes showed that the overexpression lines accumulated 30% more waxes than the WT. Concurrently, overexpression lines also deposited almost twice the amount of suberin content in their roots compared with the WT. Taken together, these results showed that <i>ANAC046</i> is an important transcription factor that promotes suberin biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> roots.
