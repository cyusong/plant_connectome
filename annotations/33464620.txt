Although the crosstalk between iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) homeostasis signalling networks exists in plants, the underlined molecular mechanism remains unclear. FIT (FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR) and four bHLH Ib members (bHLH38, bHLH39, bHLH100 and bHLH101) are the key regulators of Fe homeostasis. Here, we reveal that FIT and bHLH Ib control the up-regulation of Cu-uptake genes (COPT2, FRO4 and FRO5) by Fe deficiency, and Cu is required for improving plant growth under Fe-deficiency conditions. The induction of Cu-uptake gene expression and the elevation of Cu concentration are inhibited in the fit-2 or bhlh4x (the quadruple mutant of four bHLH Ib genes) under Fe-deficiency conditions. The dual overexpression of both bHLH38 (or bHLH39) and FIT activates the expression of COPT2, FRO4 and FRO5 and increases Cu accumulation. Furthermore, bHLH Ib proteins directly bind to the promoters of COPT2, FRO4 and FRO5. Either Cu supplement or overexpression of COPT2 or FRO4 improves the growth of fit-2 under Fe-deficiency conditions. Moreover, the induction of COPT2, FRO4 and FRO5 by Fe deficiency is independent of SPL7, a central regulator of Cu-deficiency responses. This work through the link between bHLH Ib/FIT and COPT2/FRO4/FRO5 under Fe-deficiency conditions establishes a new relationship between Cu and Fe homeostasis.
