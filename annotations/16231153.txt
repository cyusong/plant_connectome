Tomato MAF1 (LeMAF1) is a plant-specific, nuclear envelope (NE)-associated protein. It is the founding member of a group of WPP domain-containing, NE-associated proteins. This group includes the Arabidopsis WPP family, which is involved in cell division, as well as plant RanGAPs. In addition to its NE localization, LeMAF1 accumulates in speckles in the cytoplasm. Here, we show that the LeMAF1-containing speckles are components of the Golgi apparatus. A novel tomato coiled-coil protein was identified that specifically binds to LeMAF1. Tomato WPP domain-associated protein (LeWAP) interacts in yeast and in vitro through its coiled-coil domain with several WPP-domain containing proteins, including AtRanGAP1 and the WPP family (LeMAF, WPP1 and WPP2). Like LeMAF1, LeWAP is localized at the Golgi. Moreover, we present data showing that Arabidopsis WAP is necessary for the existence of a multi-protein complex containing WPP2.
