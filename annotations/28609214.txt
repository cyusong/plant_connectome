The viral protein genome-linked (VPg) of potyviruses is a protein covalently linked to the 5' end of viral RNA. It interacts with eIF4E, a component of the cellular translation initiation complex. It has been suggested that the 5' RNA-linked VPg could mimic the cellular mRNA cap, promoting synthesis of viral proteins. Here, we report evidence for recruitment of the plant eIF4E by Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV, potyvirus) particles via the 5' RNA-linked VPg. Analysis of the viral population was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based tests, either with crude extracts of LMV-infected tissues or purified viral particles. In both cases, LMV-VPg and LMV-eIF4E subpopulations could be detected. After reaching a maximum within the first 2 weeks postinoculation, these populations decreased and very few labeled particles were found later than 3 weeks postinoculation. The central domain of VPg (CD-VPg) was found to be exposed at the surface of the particles. Using a purified recombinant lettuce eIF4E and CD-VPg-specific antibodies, we demonstrate that the plant factor binds to the VPg via its central domain. Moreover, the plant eIF4E factor could be imaged at one end of the particles purified from LMV plant extracts, by immunoredox atomic force microscopy coupled to scanning electrochemical microscopy. We discuss the biological significance of these results.
