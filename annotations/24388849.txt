['24388849', 'BACKGROUND: Transmembrane leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors are commonly used  innate immune receptors in plants and animals but can also sense endogenous  signals to regulate development. BAK1 is a plant LRR-receptor-like kinase (RLK)  that interacts with several ligand-binding LRR-RLKs to positively regulate their  functions. BAK1 is involved in brassinosteroid-dependent growth and development,  innate immunity, and cell-death control by interacting with the brassinosteroid  receptor BRI1, immune receptors, such as FLS2 and EFR, and the small receptor  kinase BIR1, respectively. RESULTS: Identification of in vivo BAK1 complex  partners by LC/ESI-MS/MS uncovered two novel BAK1-interacting RLKs, BIR2 and  BIR3. Phosphorylation studies revealed that BIR2 is unidirectionally  phosphorylated by BAK1 and that the interaction between BAK1 and BIR2 is  kinase-activity dependent. Functional analyses of bir2 mutants show differential  impact on BAK1-regulated processes, such as hyperresponsiveness to  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), enhanced cell death, and  resistance to bacterial pathogens, but have no effect on  brassinosteroid-regulated growth. BIR2 interacts constitutively with BAK1,  thereby preventing interaction with the ligand-binding LRR-RLK FLS2. PAMP  perception leads to BIR2 release from the BAK1 complex and enables the  recruitment of BAK1 into the FLS2 complex. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide  evidence for a new regulatory mechanism for innate immune receptors with BIR2  acting as a negative regulator of PAMP-triggered immunity by limiting  BAK1-receptor complex formation in the absence of ligands.', '2014 Jan 20', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2013.11.047', 'Kemmerling']
