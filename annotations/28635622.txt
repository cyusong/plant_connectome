['28635622', 'Genes essential for gametophyte development and fertilization have been  identified and studied in detail; however, genes that fine-tune these processes  are largely unknown. Here, we characterized an unknown Arabidopsis gene,  GTP-BINDING PROTEIN RELATED1 (GPR1). GPR1 is specifically expressed in ovule,  pollen, and pollen tube. Enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged GPR1 localizes  to both nucleus and cytoplasm, and it also presents in punctate and ring-like  structures. gpr1 mutants exhibit no defect in gametogenesis and seed setting,  except that their pollen grains are pale in color. Scanning electron microscopy  analyses revealed a normal patterned but thinner exine on gpr1 pollen surface.  This may explain why gpr1 pollen grains are pale. We next examined whether GPR1  mutation affects post gametogenesis processes including pollen germination,  pollen tube growth, and ovule senescence. We found that gpr1 pollen grains  germinated earlier, and their pollen tubes elongated faster. Emasculation assay  revealed that unfertilized gpr1 pistil expressed the senescence marker  P(BFN1):GUS (GUS: a reporter gene that encodes beta-glucuronidase) one-day earlier  than the wild type pistil. Consistently, ovules and pollen grains of gpr1 mutants  showed lower viability than those of the wild type at 4 to 5 days post anthesis.  Together, these data suggest that GPR1 functions as a negative regulator of  pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and gametophyte senescence to fine-tune  the fertilization process.', '2017 Jun 21', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms18061303', 'Men']
