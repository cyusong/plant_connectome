Xanthomonadins are membrane-bound yellow pigments that are typically produced by phytopathogenic bacterial <i>Xanthomonas</i> spp., <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, and <i>Pseudoxanthomonas</i> spp. They are also produced by a diversity of environmental bacterial species. Considerable research has revealed that they are a unique group of halogenated, aryl-polyene, water-insoluble pigments. Xanthomonadins have been shown to play important roles in epiphytic survival and host-pathogen interactions in the phytopathogen <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i> pv. <i>campestris</i>, which is the causal agent of black rot in crucifers. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of xanthomonadin chemical structures, physiological roles, biosynthetic pathways, regulatory mechanisms, and crosstalk with other signaling pathways. The aim of the present review is to provide clues for further in-depth research on xanthomonadins from <i>Xanthomonas</i> and other related bacterial species.
