['15598800', 'We use Arabidopsis thaliana as a model to investigate coordination of cell  proliferation and cell elongation in the three components that develop side by  side in the seed. Two of these, the embryo and its nurturing annex, the  endosperm, are placed under zygotic control and develop within the seed  integument placed under maternal control. We show that integument cell  proliferation and endosperm growth are largely independent from each other. By  contrast, prevention of cell elongation in the integument by the mutation  transparent testa glabra2 (ttg2) restricts endosperm and seed growth. Conversely,  endosperm growth controlled by the HAIKU (IKU) genetic pathway modulates  integument cell elongation. Combinations of TTG2 defective seed integument with  reduction of endosperm size by iku mutations identify integument cell elongation  and endosperm growth as the primary regulators of seed size. Our results strongly  suggest that a cross talk between maternal and zygotic controls represents the  primary regulator of the coordinated control of seed size in Arabidopsis.', '2005 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.027136', 'Berger']
