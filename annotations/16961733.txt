['16961733', 'Caleosin is a Ca(2+)-binding oil-body surface protein. To assess its role in the  degradation of oil-bodies, two independent insertion mutants lacking caleosin  were studied. Both mutants demonstrated significant delay of breakdown of the  20:1 storage lipid at 48 and 60 h of germination. Additionally, although  germination rates for seeds were not affected by the mutations, mutant seedlings  grew more slowly than wild type when measured at 48 h of germination, a defect  that was corrected with continued growth for 72 and 96 h in the light. After 48 h  of germination, wild-type central vacuoles had smooth contours and demonstrated  internalization of oil bodies and of membrane containing alpha- and  delta-tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), markers for protein storage vacuoles.  In contrast, mutant central vacuoles had distorted limiting membranes displaying  domains with clumps of the two TIPs, and they contained fewer oil bodies. Thus,  during germination caleosin plays a role in the degradation of storage lipid in  oil bodies. Its role involves both the normal modification of storage vacuole  membrane and the interaction of oil bodies with vacuoles. The results indicate  that interaction of oil bodies with vacuoles is one mechanism that contributes to  the degradation of storage lipid.', '2006 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02845.x', 'Rogers']
