['19075229', 'All sun-exposed organisms are affected by UV-B [(UVB) 280-320 nm], an integral  part of sunlight. UVB can cause stresses or act as a developmental signal  depending on its fluence levels. In plants, the mechanism by which  high-fluence-rate UVB causes damages and activates DNA-repair systems has been  extensively studied. However, little is known about how nondamaging  low-fluence-rate UVB is perceived to regulate plant morphogenesis and  development. Here, we report the identification of an Arabidopsis mutant, root  UVB sensitive 1 (rus1), whose primary root is hypersensitive to very  low-fluence-rate (VLF) UVB. Under standard growth-chamber fluorescent white  light, rus1 displays stunted root growth and fails to form postembryonic leaves.  Experiments with different monochromatic light sources showed that rus1  phenotypes can be rescued if the seedlings are allowed to grow in light  conditions with minimum UVB. We determined that roots, not other organs, perceive  the UVB signal. Genetic and molecular analyses confirmed that the root  light-sensitive phenotypes are independent of all other known plant  photoreceptors. Three rus1 alleles have been identified and characterized. A  map-based approach was used to identify the RUS1 locus. RUS1 encodes a protein  that contains DUF647 (domain of unknown function 647), a domain highly conserved  in eukaryotes. Our results demonstrate a root VLF UVB-sensing mechanism that is  involved in Arabidopsis early seedling morphogenesis and development.', '2008 Dec 30', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0809942106', 'He']
