To maintain normal growth and development in a plant, gene expression must be under strict surveillance. One of the post-transcriptional regulatory pathways involves small RNA (sRNA)-guided, Argonaute (AGO) protein complex-mediated target cleavages. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the well-known sRNA species participating in the cleavage-based regulation of gene expression. In plants, most miRNAs are incorporated into AGO1-associated silencing complexes. Thus, the AGO1 protein is considered to be the most important slicer for sRNA-mediated target cleavages. Previous phylogenetic analysis revealed that AGO1, AGO5, and AGO10 belonged to the same clade in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In addition, experimental evidence pointed to the possibility that AGO2, AGO7, and AGO10 were implicated in specific miRNA-mediated regulatory pathways. To investigate the potential slicer activities of AGO2, AGO5, AGO7, and AGO10, a comprehensive search was performed for the sRNAs enriched in the four AGO proteins in Arabidopsis. A total of 3 499, 1 618, 4 632, and 63 sRNAs are enriched in AGO2, AGO5, AGO7, and AGO10, respectively. Interestingly, several miRNAs were found to be enriched in AGO2 or AGO5. Transcriptome-wide target identification based on degradome sequencing data uncovered that a number of sRNAs enriched in the four AGOs could perform target cleavages like AGO1-associated miRNAs in plants. Based on the above results, the opinion was put forward that not only AGO1, but also AGO2, AGO5, AGO7, and AGO10 might be essential for the sRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression in plants.
