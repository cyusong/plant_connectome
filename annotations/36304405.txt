BBX (B-box) proteins play a vital role in light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis. PpBBX18 was an indispensable regulator for the induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the peel of red pear fruit (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> Nakai.). However, the upstream regulation of BBX genes has not been well characterized. In this study, PpZAT5, a cysteine2/histidine2-type transcription factor, was discovered as the upstream negative regulator of PpBBX18. The results showed that PpZAT5 functions as a transcriptional repressor and directly binds to the CAAT motif of <i>PpBBX18</i> and inhibits its expression. <i>PpZAT5</i> expression was inhibited by light, which is converse to the expression pattern of anthocyanin-related structural genes. In addition, less anthocyanin accumulated in the <i>PpZAT5-</i>overexpressing pear calli than in the wild-type pear calli; on the contrary, more anthocyanin accumulated in PpZAT5-RNAi pear calli. Moreover, the crucial genes involved in light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis were markedly down-regulated in the transcriptome of PpZAT5 overexpression pear calli compared to wild-type. In conclusion, our study indicates that <i>PpBBX18</i> is negatively regulated by a C2H2-type transcriptional repressor, PpZAT5, which reduces anthocyanin content in pear. The present results demonstrate an upstream molecular mechanism of <i>PpBBX18</i> and provide insights into light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis.
