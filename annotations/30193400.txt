Seedling emergence is a critical stage in the establishment of desert plants. Soil microbes participate in plant growth and development, but information is lacking with regard to the role of microbes on seedling emergence. We applied the biocides (captan and streptomycin) to assess how seed mucilage interacts with soil microbial community and physiochemical processes to affect seedling emergence of Artemisia sphaerocephala on the desert sand dune. Fungal and bacterial community composition and diversity and fungal-bacterial interactions were changed by both captan and streptomycin. Mucilage increased soil enzyme activities and fungal-bacterial interactions. Highest seedling emergence occurred under streptomycin and mucilage treatment. Members of the phyla Firmicutes and Glomeromycota were the keystone species that improved A. sphaerocephala seedling emergence, by increasing resistance of young seedlings to drought and pathogen. Seed mucilage directly improved seedling emergence and indirectly interacted with the soil microbial community through strengthening fungal-bacterial interactions and providing favourable environment for soil enzymes to affect seedling emergence. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms by which soil microbial community and seed mucilage interactively promote successful establishment of populations of desert plants on the barren and stressful sand dune.

Mucilage: !increases! Soil enzyme activities
Mucilage: !strengthens! Fungal-bacterial interactions
Firmicutes: !improves! A. sphaerocephala seedling emergence
Glomeromycota: !improves! A. sphaerocephala seedling emergence
Captan: !changes! Fungal and bacterial community composition
Streptomycin: !changes! Fungal and bacterial community composition
