<i>Erwinia amylovora</i> causes fire blight on rosaceous plants. One of the major entry points of <i>E. amylovora</i> into hosts is flowers, where <i>E. amylovora</i> proliferates epiphytically on stigmatic and hypanthium surfaces and, subsequently, causes endophytic infection at the hypanthium. The type III secretion system (T3SS) is an important virulence factor in <i>E. amylovora.</i> Although the role of T3SS during endophytic infection is well characterized, its expression during epiphytic colonization and role in the subsequent infection is less understood. Here, we investigated T3SS gene expression in epiphytic <i>E. amylovora</i> on stigma and hypanthium of apple flowers under different relative humidities (RH). On stigma surfaces, T3SS was expressed in a high percentage of <i>E. amylovora</i> cells, and its expression promoted epiphytic growth. On hypanthium surfaces, however, T3SS was expressed in fewer <i>E. amylovora</i> cells than on the stigma, and displayed no correlation with epiphytic growth, even though T3SS expression is essential for infection. <i>E. amylovora</i> cells grown on stigmatic surfaces and then flushed down to the hypanthium displayed a higher level of T3SS expression than cells grown on the hypanthium surface alone. Furthermore, <i>E. amylovora</i> cells precultured on stigma had a higher potential to infect flowers than <i>E. amylovora</i> cells precultured in a T3SS-repressive medium. This suggests that T3SS induction during the stigmatic epiphytic colonization may be beneficial for subsequent infection. Finally, epiphytic expression of T3SS was influenced by RH. Higher percentage of stigmatic <i>E. amylovora</i> cells expressed T3SS under high RH than under low RH.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
