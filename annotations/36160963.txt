Grafting is one of the key agronomic measures to enhance the tolerance to environmental stresses in horticultural plants, but the specific molecular regulation mechanism in this tolerance largely remains unclear. Here, we found that cucumber grafted onto figleaf gourd rootstock increased cold tolerance through abscisic acid (ABA) activating WRKY41/WRKY46-miR396b-5p-TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat-like superfamily protein) module. Cucumber seedlings grafted onto figleaf gourd increased cold tolerance and induced the expression of miR396b-5p. Furthermore, overexpression of cucumber miR396b-5p in Arabidopsis improved cold tolerance. 5' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RLM-RACE) and transient transformation experiments demonstrated that <i>TPR</i> was the target gene of miR396b-5p, while <i>TPR</i> overexpression plants were hypersensitive to cold stress. The yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays showed that both WRKY41 and WRKY46 bound to <i>MIR396b-5p</i> promoter to induce its expression. Furthermore, cold stress enhanced the content of ABA in the roots and leaves of figleaf gourd grafted cucumber seedlings. Exogenous application of ABA induced the expression of <i>WRKY41</i> and <i>WRKY46</i>, and cold tolerance of grafted cucumber seedlings. However, figleaf gourd rootstock-induced cold tolerance was compromised when plants were pretreated with ABA biosynthesis inhibitor. Thus, ABA mediated figleaf gourd grafting-induced cold tolerance of cucumber seedlings through activating the WRKY41/WRKY46-miR396b-5p-<i>TPR</i> module.
