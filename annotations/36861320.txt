The CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIPIII) transcription factors (TFs) were repeatedly deployed over 725 million years of evolution to regulate central developmental innovations. The START domain of this pivotal class of developmental regulators was recognized over twenty years ago, but its putative ligands and functional contributions remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the START domain promotes HD-ZIPIII TF homodimerization and increases transcriptional potency. Effects on transcriptional output can be ported onto heterologous TFs, consistent with principles of evolution via domain capture. We also show the START domain binds several species of phospholipids, and that mutations in conserved residues perturbing ligand binding and/or its downstream conformational readout, abolish HD-ZIPIII DNA-binding competence. Our data present a model in which the START domain potentiates transcriptional activity and uses ligand-induced conformational change to render HD-ZIPIII dimers competent to bind DNA. These findings resolve a long-standing mystery in plant development and highlight the flexible and diverse regulatory potential coded within this widely distributed evolutionary module.
