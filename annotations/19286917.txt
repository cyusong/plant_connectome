['19286917', 'HHP1 (heptahelical protein 1), a protein with a predicted seven transmembrane  domain structure homologous to adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) and membrane  progestin receptors (mPRs), has been characterized. Expression of HHP1 was  increased in response to abscisic acid (ABA) and salt/osmotic stress as shown by  quantitative real-time PCR and HHP1 promoter-controlled GUS activity. The HHP1  T-DNA insertion mutant (hhp1-1) showed a higher sensitivity to ABA and osmotic  stress than the wild-type (WT), as revealed by the germination rate and  post-germination growth rate. The induced expression of stress-responsive genes  (RD29A, RD29B, ADH1, KIN1, COR15A, and COR47) was more sensitive to exogenous ABA  and osmotic stress in hhp1-1 than in the WT. The hypersensitivity in the hhp1-1  mutant was reversed in the complementation mutant of HHP1 expressing the HHP1  gene. The data suggest that the mutation of HHP1 renders plants hypersensitive to  ABA and osmotic stress and HHP1 might be a negative regulator in ABA and osmotic  signalling.', '2009', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erp039', 'Yang']
