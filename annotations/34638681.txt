Reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling is crucial in modulating stress responses in plants, and NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are an important component of signal transduction under salt stress. The goal of this research was to investigate whether the regulation of NOX-dependent signalling during mild and severe salinity differs between the halophyte <i>Eutrema salsugineum</i> and the glycophyte <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Gene expression analyses showed that salt-induced expression patterns of two NOX genes, <i>RBOHD</i> and <i>RBOHF</i>, varied between the halophyte and the glycophyte. Five days of salinity stimulated the expression of both genes in <i>E. salsugineum</i> leaves, while their expression in <i>A. thaliana</i> decreased. This was not accompanied by changes in the total NOX activity in <i>E. salsugineum</i>, while the activity in <i>A. thaliana</i> was reduced. The expression of the <i>RBOHD</i> and <i>RBOHF</i> genes in <i>E. salsugineum</i> leaves was induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and ethephon spraying. The in silico analyses of promoter sequences of <i>RBOHD</i> and <i>RBOHF</i> revealed multiple <i>cis</i>-acting elements related to hormone responses, and their distribution varied between <i>E. salsugineum</i> and <i>A. thaliana</i>. Our results indicate that, in the halophyte <i>E. salsugineum</i>, the maintenance of the basal activity of NOXs in leaves plays a role during acclimation responses to salt stress. The different expression patterns of the <i>RBOHD</i> and <i>RBOHF</i> genes under salinity in <i>E. salsugineum</i> and <i>A. thaliana</i> point to a modified regulation of these genes in the halophyte, possibly through ABA- and/or ethylene-dependent pathways.
