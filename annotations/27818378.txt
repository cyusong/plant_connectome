In plants, two genes encode ferrochelatase (FC), which catalyzes iron chelation into protoporphyrin IX at the final step of heme biosynthesis. FERROCHELATASE1 (FC1) is continuously, but weakly expressed in roots and leaves, while FC2 is dominantly active in leaves. As a continuation of previous studies on the physiological consequences of FC2 inactivation in tobacco, we aimed to assign FC1 function in plant organs. While reduced FC2 expression leads to protoporphyrin IX accumulation in leaves, FC1 down-regulation and overproduction caused reduced and elevated FC activity in root tissue, respectively, but were not associated with changes in macroscopic phenotype, plant development or leaf pigmentation. In contrast to the lower heme content resulting from a deficiency of the dominant FC2 expression in leaves, a reduction of FC1 in roots and leaves does not significantly disturb heme accumulation. The FC1 overexpression was used for an additional approach to re-examine FC activity in mitochondria. Transgenic FC1 protein was immunologically shown to be present in mitochondria. Although matching only a small portion of total cellular FC activity, the mitochondrial FC activity in a FC1 overexpressor line increased 5-fold in comparison with wild-type mitochondria. Thus, it is suggested that FC1 contributes to mitochondrial heme synthesis.
