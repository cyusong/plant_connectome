Narrow-leafed lupin (NLL, Lupinus angustifolius) is a promising legume crop that produces seeds with very high protein content. However, NLL accumulates toxic quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs) in most of its tissues, including the seeds. To determine the level of in situ biosynthesis in the seeds, we compared the accumulation of QAs with the expression of the biosynthetic gene lysine decarboxylase (LDC) in developing seeds and pods of a bitter (high-QA) variety of NLL. While QAs accumulated steadily in seeds until the drying phase, LDC expression was comparatively very low throughout seed development. In contrast, both QA accumulation and LDC expression peaked early in pods and decreased subsequently, reaching background levels at the onset of drying. We complemented these studies with MS imaging, which revealed the distribution patterns of individual QAs in cross-sections of pods and seeds. Finally, we show that a paternal bitter genotype does not influence the QA levels of F1 seeds grown on a maternal, low-QA genotype. We conclude that the accumulation of QAs in seeds of bitter NLL is mostly, if not exclusively, transported from other tissues. These results open the possibility of using transport engineering to generate herbivore-resistant bitter NLL varieties that produce QA-free seeds.
