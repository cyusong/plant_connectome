MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding endogenous small RNAs (long 20-24 nucleotides) that negatively regulate eukaryotes gene expression at post-transcriptional level <i>via</i> cleavage or/and translational inhibition of targeting mRNA. Based on the diverse roles of miRNA in regulating eukaryotes gene expression, research on the identification of miRNA target genes has been carried out, and a growing body of research has demonstrated that miRNAs act on target genes and are involved in various biological functions of plants. It has an important influence on plant growth and development, morphogenesis, and stress response. Recent case studies indicate that miRNA-mediated regulation pattern may improve agronomic properties and confer abiotic stress resistance of plants, so as to ensure sustainable agricultural production. In this regard, we focus on the recent updates on miRNAs and their targets involved in responding to abiotic stress including low temperature, high temperature, drought, soil salinity, and heavy metals, as well as plant-growing development. In particular, this review highlights the diverse functions of miRNAs on achieving the desirable agronomic traits in important crops. Herein, the main research strategies of miRNAs involved in abiotic stress resistance and crop traits improvement were summarized. Furthermore, the miRNA-related challenges and future perspectives of plants have been discussed. miRNA-based research lays the foundation for exploring miRNA regulatory mechanism, which aims to provide insights into a potential form of crop improvement and stress resistance breeding.
