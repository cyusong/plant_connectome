Different plant plastid types contain a distinct protein complement for specialized functions and metabolic activities. plprot was established as a plastid proteome database to provide information about the proteomes of chloroplasts, etioplasts and undifferentiated plastids. The current version of plprot features 2,043 protein entries and consists of two modules. Module one contains a BLAST search option and provides comparative information on the proteomes of different plastid types. The second module contains four searchable databases, three for each individual plastid type and one comprehensive composite database that provides the results of plastid proteome analyses from different laboratories. plprot is accessible at http://www.plprot.ethz.ch.
