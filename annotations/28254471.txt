Maize is the world's most produced crop, providing food, feed, and biofuel. Maize production is constantly threatened by the presence of devastating pathogens worldwide. Characterization of the genetic components underlying disease resistance is a major research area in maize which is highly relevant for resistance breeding programs. Quantitative disease resistance (QDR) is the type of resistance most widely used by maize breeders. The past decade has witnessed significant progress in fine-mapping and cloning of genes controlling QDR. The molecular mechanisms underlying QDR remain poorly understood and exploited. In this review we discuss recent advances in maize QDR research and strategy for resistance breeding.
