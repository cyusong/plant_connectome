Ultrasonic (US) treatment is an efficient method to induce crop tolerance against heavy metal toxicity; however, US-induced aluminum (Al) tolerance in peanuts was rarely studied. This study was comprised of two treatments, namely, CK, without ultrasonic treatment, and US, an ultrasonic seed treatment, for 15 min. Both treated and non-treated treatments were applied with Al in the form of AlCl<sub>3</sub>.18H<sub>2</sub>O at 5 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> in Hoagland solution at one leaf stage. Results depicted that plant height, main root length, and number of lateral roots increased significantly under US treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that plant hormone signal transduction and transcription factors (TFs) were significantly enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in US treatment, and the plant hormones were measured, including salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) contents, were substantially increased, while indole acetic acid (IAA) and jasmonic acid (JA) contents were decreased significantly in US treatment. The TFs were verified using quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR, and it was found that multiple TFs genes were significantly upregulated in US treatment, and <i>ALMT9</i> and <i>FRDL1</i> genes were also significantly upregulated in US treatment. Overall, the US treatment induced the regulation of hormone content and regulated gene expression by regulating TFs to improve Al tolerance in peanuts. This study provided a theoretical rationale for US treatment to improve Al tolerance in peanuts.
