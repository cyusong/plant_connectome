['12324613', 'Variation in plant shoot structure may be described as occurring through changes  within a basic unit, the metamer. Using this terminology, the apical meristem of  Arabidopsis produces three metameric types sequentially: type 1, rosette; type 2,  coflorescence-bearing with bract; and type 3, flower-bearing without bract. We  describe a mutant of Arabidopsis, Leafy, homozygous for a recessive allele of a  nuclear gene LEAFY (LFY), that has an inflorescence composed only of type 2-like  metamers. These data suggest that the LFY gene is required for the development of  type 3 metamers and that the transition from type 2 to type 3 metamers is a  developmental step distinct from that between vegetative and reproductive growth  (type 1 to type 2 metamers). Results from double mutant analysis, showing that  lfy-1 is epistatic to the floral organ homeotic gene ap2-6, are consistent with  the hypothesis that a functional LFY gene is necessary for the expression of  downstream genes controlling floral organ identity.', '1991 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.3.8.771', 'Haughn']
