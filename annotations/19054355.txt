['19054355', 'Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is a widely conserved cytoprotective protein localized in  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. We identified Arabidopsis  cytochrome b(5) (AtCb5) as an interactor of Arabidopsis BI-1 (AtBI-1) by  screening the Arabidopsis cDNA library with the split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid  (suY2H) system. Cb5 is an electron transfer protein localized mainly in the ER  membrane. In addition, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay  and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis confirmed that AtBI-1  interacted with AtCb5 in plants. On the other hand, we found that the  AtBI-1-mediated suppression of cell death in yeast requires Saccharomyces  cerevisiae fatty acid hydroxylase 1 (ScFAH1), which had a Cb5-like domain at the  N terminus and interacted with AtBI-1. ScFAH1 is a sphingolipid fatty acid  2-hydroxylase localized in the ER membrane. In contrast, AtFAH1 and AtFAH2, which  are functional ScFAH1 homologues in Arabidopsis, had no Cb5-like domain, and  instead interacted with AtCb5 in plants. These results suggest that AtBI-1  interacts with AtFAHs via AtCb5 in plant cells. Furthermore, the overexpression  of AtBI-1 increased the level of 2-hydroxy fatty acids in Arabidopsis, indicating  that AtBI-1 is involved in fatty acid 2-hydroxylation.', '2009 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03765.x', 'Kawai-Yamada']
