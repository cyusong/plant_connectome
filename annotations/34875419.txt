Rice is generally sensitive to chilling stress, which seriously affects growth and yield. Since early in the last century, considerable efforts have been made to understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the response to chilling stress and improve rice chilling tolerance. Here, we review the research trends and advances in this field. The phenotypic and biochemical changes caused by cold stress and the physiological explanations are briefly summarized. Using published data from the past 20 years, we reviewed the past progress and important techniques in the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL), novel genes, and cellular pathways involved in rice chilling tolerance. The advent of novel technologies has significantly advanced studies of cold tolerance, and the characterization of QTLs, key genes, and molecular modules have sped up molecular design breeding for cold tolerance in rice varieties. In addition to gene function studies based on overexpression or artificially generated mutants, elucidating natural allelic variation in specific backgrounds is emerging as a novel approach for the study of cold tolerance in rice, and the superior alleles identified using this approach can directly facilitate breeding.
