['35876822', 'ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family proteins, one type of small  guanine-nucleotide-binding (G) proteins, play a central role in regulating  vesicular traffic and organelle structures in eukaryotes. The Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome contains more than 21 ARF proteins, but relatively  little is known about the functional heterogeneity of ARF homologs in plants.  Here, we characterized the function of a unique ARF protein, ARFD1B, in  Arabidopsis. ARFD1B exhibited both cytosol and punctate localization patterns,  colocalizing with a Golgi marker in protoplasts and transgenic plants. Distinct  from other ARF1 homologs, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant form of  ARFD1B did not alter the localization of the Golgi marker mannosidase I  (ManI)-RFP in Arabidopsis cells. Interestingly, the ARFD1 artificial microRNA  knockdown mutant arfd1 displayed a deleterious growth phenotype, while this  phenotype was restored in complemented plants. Further, confocal imaging and  transmission electron microscopy analyses of the arfd1 mutant revealed defective  cell plate formation and abnormal Golgi morphology. Pull-down and liquid  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses identified Coat Protein I (COPI)  components as interacting partners of ARFD1B, and subsequent bimolecular  fluorescence complementation, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid, and  co-immunoprecipitation assays further confirmed these interactions. These results  demonstrate that ARFD1 is required for cell plate formation, maintenance of Golgi  morphology, and plant growth in Arabidopsis.', '2022 Sep 28', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiac329', 'ORCID:']
