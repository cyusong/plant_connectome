['16673933', 'Parasitism genes expressed in the esophageal gland cells of root-knot nematodes  encode proteins that are secreted into host root cells to transform the recipient  cells into enlarged multinucleate feeding cells called giant-cells. Expression of  a root-knot nematode parasitism gene which encodes a novel 13-amino-acid  secretory peptide in plant tissues stimulated root growth. Two SCARECROW-like  transcription factors of the GRAS protein family were identified as the putative  targets for this bioactive nematode peptide in yeast two-hybrid analyses and  confirmed by in vitro and in vivo coimmunoprecipitations. This discovery is the  first demonstration of a direct interaction of a nematode-secreted parasitism  peptide with a plant-regulatory protein, which may represent an early signaling  event in the root-knot nematode-host interaction.', '2006 May', 'Mol Plant Microbe Interact', '10.1094/MPMI-19-0463', 'Hussey']
