The productivity of agricultural produce is fairly dependent on the availability of nutrients and efficient use. Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) is an essential macronutrient of living cells and is the second most prevalent free divalent cation in plants. Mg<sup>2+</sup> plays a role in several physiological processes that support plant growth and development. However, it has been largely forgotten in fertilization management strategies to increase crop production, which leads to severe reductions in plant growth and yield. In this review, we discuss how the Mg<sup>2+</sup> shortage induces several responses in plants at different levels: morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular. Additionally, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake and transport mechanisms in different cellular organelles and the role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters in regulating Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis are also discussed. Overall, in this review, we critically summarize the available information about the responses of Mg deficiency on plant growth and development, which would facilitate plant scientists to create Mg<sup>2+</sup>-deficiency-resilient crops through agronomic and genetic biofortification.
