Calcium and protons exert control over the formation and activity of the cytoskeleton, usually by modulating an associated motor protein or one that affects the structural organization of the polymer.

Calcium: !controls! Formation/Activity of Cytoskeleton
Protons: !controls! Formation/Activity of Cytoskeleton
Motor Protein: !modulated by! Calcium/Protons
Structural Organization of Polymer: !affected by! Motor Protein
