['11340191', 'The specific roles of the chlorophyll a/b binding proteins CP29 and CP26 in light  harvesting and energy dissipation within the photosynthetic apparatus have been  investigated. Arabidopsis was transformed with antisense constructs against the  genes encoding the CP29 or CP26 apoprotein, which gave rise to several transgenic  lines with remarkably low amounts of the antisense target proteins. The decrease  in the level of CP24 protein in the CP29 antisense lines indicates a physical  interaction between these complexes. Analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence showed  that removal of the proteins affected photosystem II function, probably as a  result of changes in the organization of the light-harvesting antenna. However,  whole plant measurements showed that overall photosynthetic rates were similar to  those in the wild type. Both antisense lines were capable of the qE type of  nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching, although there were minor changes in the  capacity for quenching and in its induction kinetics. High-light-induced  violaxanthin deepoxidation to zeaxanthin was not affected, although the pool size  of these pigments was decreased slightly. We conclude that CP29 and CP26 are  unlikely to be sites for nonphotochemical quenching.', '2001 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.13.5.1193', 'Jansson']
