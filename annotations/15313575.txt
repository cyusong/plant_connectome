['15313575', 'Arabidopsis thaliana RGS1 is a novel "regulator of G-protein signaling" (AtRGS1)  protein that consists of an N-terminal seven transmembrane domain characteristic  of G-protein-coupled receptors and a C-terminal RGS box. AtRGS1 modulates plant  cell proliferation. Atrgs1 mutants are insensitive to glucose and less sensitive  to fructose and sucrose, suggesting that sugar signaling in Arabidopsis involves  AtRGS1. In addition, sugar metabolism and phosphorylation by hexokinase (HXK) are  not required for AtRGS1-mediated sugar signaling, suggesting that AtRGS1  functions in a HXK-independent glucose signaling pathway.', '2004', 'Methods Enzymol', '10.1016/S0076-6879(04)89020-7', 'Jones']
