The yield and quality of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) is seriously affected by Phytophthora infestans. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Sl-lncRNA39896 is induced after P. infestans infection and was previously predicted to act as an endogenous target mimic (eTM) for the microRNA Sl-miR166b, which function in stress responses. Here, we further examined the role of Sl-lncRNA39896 and Sl-miR166b in tomato resistance to P. infestans. Sl-miR166b levels were higher in Sl-lncRNA39896-knockout mutants than in wild-type plants, and the mutants displayed enhanced resistance to P. infestans. A six-point mutation in the region of Sl-lncRNA39896 that binds to Sl-miR166b disabled the interaction, suggesting that Sl-lncRNA39896 acts as an eTM for Sl-miR166b. Overexpressing Sl-miR166b yielded a similar phenotype to that produced by Sl-lncRNA39896-knockout, whereas silencing of Sl-miR166b impaired resistance. We verified that Sl-miR166b cleaved transcripts of its target class III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes SlHDZ34 and SlHDZ45. Silencing of SlHDZ34/45 decreased pathogen accumulation in plants infected with P. infestans. Additionally, jasmonic acid and ethylene contents were elevated following infection in the plants with enhanced resistance. Sl-lncRNA39896 is the first known lncRNA to negatively regulate resistance to P. infestans in tomato. We propose a novel mechanism in which the lncRNA39896-miR166b-HDZ module modulates resistance to P. infestans.
