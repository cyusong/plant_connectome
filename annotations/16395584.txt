Inositol plays a role in membrane trafficking and signaling in addition to regulating cellular metabolism and controlling growth. In plants, the myo-inositol-1-phosphate is synthesized from glucose 6-phosphate in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4). Inositol can be converted into phytic acid (phytate), the most abundant form of phosphate in seeds. The path to phytate has been suggested to proceed via the sequential phosphorylation of inositol phosphates, and/or in part via phosphatidylinositol phosphate. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] lines were produced using interfering RNA (RNAi) construct in order to silence the myo-inositol-1-phosphate (GmMIPS1) gene. We have observed an absence of seed development in lines in which the presence of GmMIPS1 transcripts was not detected. In addition, a drastic reduction of phytate (InsP6) content was achieved in transgenic lines (up to 94.5%). Our results demonstrated an important correlation between GmMIPS1 gene expression and seed development.
