WRKY is an important complex family of transcription factors involved in plant immune responses. Among them, <i>WRKY70</i> plays an important role in the process of the plant defense response to the invasion of pathogens. However, the defense mechanism of <i>PsnWRKY70</i> is not clear in <i>Populus nigra</i>. In this study, we showed that <i>PsnWRKY70</i>-overexpression lines (OE) had fewer leaf blight symptoms than <i>PsnWRKY70</i>-repressing lines (RE). <i>PsnWRKY70</i> activated MAP kinase cascade genes (<i>PsnM2K4</i>, <i>PsnMPK3</i>, <i>PsnM3K18</i>), calcium channel proteins-related genes (<i>PsnCNG3</i>, <i>PsnCNGC1</i>, <i>PsnCNG4</i>), and calcium-dependent protein kinases genes (<i>PsnCDPKL</i>, <i>PsnCDPKW</i>, <i>PsnCDPKS</i>, <i>PsnCDPKQ</i>). Furthermore, 129 genes of <i>PsnWRKY70</i> putative genome-wide direct targets (DTGs) were identified by using transcriptome (RNA-seq) and DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq). <i>PsnWRKY70</i> directly binds to the promoters of homologous genes and LRR domain proteins to promote the expression of <i>WRKY6</i>, <i>WRKY18</i>, <i>WRKY22</i>, and <i>WRKY22-1</i>, LRR domain proteins <i>LRR8</i>, <i>LRR-RLK</i>, <i>ADR1-like 2</i>, <i>NB-ARC</i>, etc. Our study suggests that <i>PsnWRKY70</i> enhances the resistance of <i>A. alternata</i> in poplar by activating genes in both pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI).
