Recognition of bacterial effector proteins by plant cells is crucial for plant disease and defense response signaling. The Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv) type III effector protein, AvrBsT, is secreted into plant cells from Xcv strain Bv5-4a. Here, we demonstrate that dexamethasone (DEX): avrBsT overexpression triggers cell death signaling in healthy transgenic Arabidopsis plants. AvrBsT overexpression in Arabidopsis also reduced susceptibility to infection with the obligate biotrophic oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Overexpression of avrBsT significantly induced some defense-related genes in Arabidopsis leaves. A high-throughput in planta proteomics screen identified TCP-1 chaperonin, SEC7-like guanine nucleotide exchange protein and calmodulin-like protein, which were differentially expressed in DEX:avrBsT-overexpression (OX) Arabidopsis plants during Hp. arabidopsidis infection. Treatment with purified GST-tagged AvrBsT proteins distinctly inhibited the growth and sporulation of Hp. arabidopsidis on Arabdiopsis cotyledons. In contrast, DEX:avrBsT-OX plants exhibited enhanced susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 infection. Notably, susceptible cell death and enhanced electrolyte leakage were significantly induced in the Pst-infected leaves of DEX:avrBsT-OX plants. Together, these results suggest that Xcv effector AvrBsT overexpression triggers plant cell death, disease and defense signaling leading to both disease and defense responses to microbial pathogens of different lifestyles.
