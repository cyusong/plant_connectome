['32690890', 'The survival of all living organisms requires the ability to detect attacks and  swiftly counter them with protective immune responses. Despite considerable  mechanistic advances, the interconnectivity of signalling modules often remains  unclear. A newly characterized protein, IMMUNOREGULATORY RNA-BINDING PROTEIN  (IRR), negatively regulates immune responses in both maize and Arabidopsis, with  disrupted function resulting in enhanced disease resistance. IRR associates with  and promotes canonical splicing of transcripts encoding defence signalling  proteins, including the key negative regulator of pattern-recognition receptor  signalling complexes, CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 28 (CPK28). On immune  activation by Plant Elicitor Peptides (Peps), IRR is dephosphorylated, disrupting  interaction with CPK28 transcripts and resulting in the accumulation of an  alternative splice variant encoding a truncated CPK28 protein with impaired  kinase activity and diminished function as a negative regulator. We demonstrate a  new mechanism linking Pep-induced post-translational modification of IRR with  post-transcriptionally mediated attenuation of CPK28 function to dynamically  amplify Pep signalling and immune output.', '2020 Aug', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/s41477-020-0724-1', 'ORCID:']
