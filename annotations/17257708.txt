As the second enzyme of the non-mevalonate terpenoid pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis, DXP reductoisomerase (DXR, EC: 1.1.1.267) catalyzes a committed step of the MEP pathway for camptothecin (CPT) biosynthesis. In order to understand more about the role of DXR involved in the CPT biosynthesis at the molecular level, the full-length DXR cDNA sequence (designated as CaDXR) was isolated and characterized for the first time from a medicinal Nyssaceae plant species, Camptotheca acuminata. The full-length cDNA of CaDXR was 1823 bp containing a 1416 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 472 amino acids. Comparative and bioinformatic analyses revealed that CaDXR showed extensive homology with DXRs from other plant species and contained a conserved transit peptide for plastids, an extended Pro-rich region and a highly conserved NADPH binding motif in its N-terminal region owned by all plant DXRs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CaDXR was more ancient than other plant DXRs. Tissue expression pattern analysis revealed that CaDXR expressed strongly in stem, weak in leaf and root. CaDXR was found to be an elicitor-responsive gene, which could be induced by exogenous elicitor of methyl jasmonate. The functional color complementation assay indicated that CaDXR could accelerate the biosynthesis of carotenoids in the Escherichia coli transformant, demonstrating that DXP reductoisomerase plays an influential step in isoprenoid biosynthesis.
