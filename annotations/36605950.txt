Harnessing the potential yields of evergreen perennial crops like tea (<i>Camellia sinensis</i> L.) essentially requires the application of optimum doses of nutrients based on the soil test reports. In the present study, the soil pH, organic carbon (OC), available potassium as K<sub>2</sub>O (AK), and available sulphur (AS) of 7300 soil samples from 115 tea estates spread over the Dooars ranging from 88°52'E to 89°86'E longitude and 26°45'N to 27°00'N latitude of West Bengal, India have been documented. About 54% of soil samples were found within the optimum range of soil pH (4.50-5.50) for tea cultivation. The overall range of OC was found from 0.28% to 6.00% of which, 94% of the analyzed samples were within the range of satisfactory to excellent level of OC i.e. (>0.80% to 6.00%). Around 36.3% of soil samples were found to have high AK (>100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) but 37.1% of soils were found to have high AS content (>40 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). The nutrient index status of soil pH was low in Dam Dim, Chulsa, Nagrakata, Binnaguri, and Jainti sub-districts. Soils from five sub-districts had a high nutrient index (2.47 to 2.83) for soil organic carbon. However, it existed in the medium index (1.69 and 2.22) for Dalgaon and Kalchini sub-districts. Only Nagrakata sub-district soil samples were in the high nutrient index (2.65) for AK. All analyzed samples showed a medium nutrient index (1.97 to 2.27) for AS. The result indicated that soil pH was significantly negatively correlated with soil OC (-0.336) and AK (-0.174). However, the soil OC was significantly positive correlated with AK (0.258) and AS (0.100). It could be concluded that a balanced fertilizer application would be needed as a part of the soil improvement program through soil chemical tests for sustainable tea cultivation.
