['20624295', 'ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) mediates microRNA- and small interfering RNA-directed  posttranscriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutant alleles of  SQUINT (SQN) slightly reduce AGO1 activity and have weak effects on shoot  morphology. A screen for mutations that suppress the sqn phenotype produced  loss-of-function mutations in the F-box gene FBW2. Mutations in FBW2 not only  suppress sqn but also suppress many of the developmental phenotypes of weak, but  not null, alleles of AGO1 by increasing AGO1 protein levels. Conversely,  over-expression of FBW2 decreases the abundance of the AGO1 protein but not AGO1  messenger RNA, further indicating that FBW2 regulates AGO1 protein levels. fbw2  mutants have no obvious morphological phenotype, but display a reduced  sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) that can be attributed to increased AGO1  activity. Our results indicate that FBW2 is a novel negative regulator of AGO1  and suggest that it plays a role in ABA signalling and/or response.', '2010 Jul 12', 'Silence', '10.1186/1758-907X-1-15', 'Poethig']
