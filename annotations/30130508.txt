A recent study reveals a novel type of trophic interaction: galls induced on a native Florida oak by cynipid wasps are attacked by love vine, a subtropical parasitic plant. Attack is fatal to the wasp, and thus there is the opportunity for the vine to exert selection on the wasp to alter gall structure.
