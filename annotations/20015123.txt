MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of gene expression regulators that play crucial roles in many biological processes. Recently, several reports have revealed that micoRNAs participate in regulation of symbiotic interaction between plants and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria. However, the role of miRNAs in another type of plant-microbe interaction, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, has not been documented. We carried out a microarray screen and poly(A)-tailed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) validation for miRNA expression in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) under varying phosphate (Pi) availability and AM symbiosis conditions. In roots, miRNA158, miRNA862-3p, miRNA319, miRNA394 and miR399 were differentially regulated under three different treatments, Pi sufficient (+P ), Pi deficient (-P) and AM symbiosis (+M ). In leaves, up to 14 miRNAs were up- or down-regulated under either or both of the Pi treatments and AM symbiosis, of which miR158, miR319 and miR399 were responsive to the treatments in both roots and leaves. We detected that miR395, miR779.1, miR840 and miR867 in leaves were specifically responsive to AM symbiosis, which is independent of Pi availability, whereas miR398 in leaves and miR399 in both roots and leaves were Pi starvation induced. Furthermore, miR158 in roots as well as miR837-3p in leaves were responsive to both Pi deprivation and AM colonization. In contrast, miR862-3p in roots was responsive to Pi nutrition, but not to AM symbiosis. Moreover, the group of miRNA consisting miR319 and miR394 in roots and miR158, miR169g*, miR172, miR172b*, miR319, miR771 and miR775 in leaves were up- and down-regulated by Pi starvation, respectively. The data suggest that altered expression of distinct groups of miRNA is an essential component of Pi starvation-induced responses and AM symbiosis.
