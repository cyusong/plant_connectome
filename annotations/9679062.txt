['9679062', 'The EIR1 gene of Arabidopsis is a member of a family of plant genes with  similarities to bacterial membrane transporters. This gene is expressed only in  the root, which is consistent with the phenotypes of the eir1 mutants-the roots  are agravitropic and have a reduced sensitivity to ethylene. The roots of eir1  mutants are also insensitive to the excess auxin produced by alf1-1 and fail to  induce an auxin-inducible gene in the expansion zone. Although they fail to  respond to internally generated auxin, they respond normally to externally  applied auxin. Expression of the EIR1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae confers  resistance to fluorinated indolic compounds. Taken together, these data suggest  that the EIR1 protein has a root-specific role in the transport of auxin.', '1998 Jul 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.12.14.2175', 'Fink']
