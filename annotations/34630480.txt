Root systems are instrumental for water and nutrient uptake and the anchorage of plants in the soil. Root regulating GL2-interacting repressors (GIRs) contain a Short RING-like Zinc-Finger (SRNF) domain, but there has been no comprehensive characterization about this gene family in any plant species. Here, we renamed the GIR-like proteins as SRNF proteins due to their conserved domain and identified 140 <i>SRNF</i> genes from 16 plant species including 24 <i>GhSRNF</i> genes in <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>. Phylogenetic analysis of the SRNFs revealed both similarities and divergences between five subfamilies. Notably, synteny analysis revealed that polyploidization and whole-genome duplication contribute to the expansion of the <i>GhSRNF</i> gene family. Various cis-acting regulatory elements were shown to be pertinent to light, phytohormone, defense responsive, and meristem regulation. Furthermore, <i>GhSRNF2</i>/<i>15</i> were predominantly expressed in root, whereas the expression of <i>GhSRNF18</i> is positively correlated with the primary root (PR) length in <i>G. hirsutum</i>, quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Over-expression of <i>GhSRNF18</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of <i>GhSRNF18</i> in <i>G. hirsutum</i> has revealed the role of GhSRNF18 in PR growth. The over-expression of <i>GhSRNF18</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> resulted in an increase of meristematic activities and auxin accumulations in PRs, which were consistent with the transcriptomic data. Our results suggested that <i>GhSRNF18</i> positively regulates PR growth. This study increased our understanding of the <i>SRNF</i> gene family in plants and provided a novel rationale for the further investigation of cotton root morphogenesis regulated by the <i>GhSRNFs</i>.
