Environmental drought and high salinity impose osmotic stress, which inhibits plant growth and yield. Thus, understanding how plants respond to osmotic stress is critical to improve crop productivity. Plants have multiple signalling pathways in response to osmotic stress in which the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays important roles. However, since little is known concerning key early components, the global osmotic stress-signalling network remains to be elucidated. Here, we review recent advances in the identification of osmotic-stress activated Raf-like protein kinases as regulators of ABA-dependent and -independent signalling pathways and discuss the plant stress-responsive kinase network from an evolutionary perspective.

Environmental drought: !inhibits! Plant growth
High salinity: !inhibits! Plant growth
ABA: !plays roles in! Plant signalling pathways
Raf-like protein kinases: !regulate! ABA-dependent and -independent pathways
Osmotic stress: !activates! Raf-like protein kinases
