Abiotic stresses adversely affect plant growth and the yield of crops worldwide. R2R3-MYB transcriptional factors have been found to be vital for plants to confer stress response. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, FOUR LIPS (FLP, MYB124) and its paralogous MYB88 function redundantly regulated the symmetric division of guard mother cells (GMCs) and abiotic stress response. Here, OsFLP was identified as an R2R3-MYB transcriptional activator and localized in the nucleus. <i>OsFLP</i> was transiently induced by drought, salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA). Overexpression of <i>OsFLP</i> showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses. The stomatal density in <i>OsFLP-OE</i> plants was not changed, whereas the stomatal closure was sensitive to ABA treatment compared to wild-type plants. In contrast, <i>OsFLP</i>-RNAi plants had abnormal stomata and were sensitive to drought. Moreover, the transcripts of stomatal closure-related genes <i>DST</i> and <i>peroxidase 24 precursor</i>, which are identified as downstream of OsNAC1, were inhibited in <i>OsFLP</i>-RNAi plants. The yeast-one-hybrid assay indicated that OsFLP can specifically bind and positively regulate <i>OsNAC1</i> and <i>OsNAC6</i>. Meanwhile, stress response genes, such as <i>OsLEA3</i> and <i>OsDREB2A</i>, were up-regulated in <i>OsFLP</i>-OE plants. These findings suggested that OsFLP positively participates in drought stress, mainly through regulating regulators' transcripts of <i>OsNAC1</i> and <i>OsNAC6</i>.
