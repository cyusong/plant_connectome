The extreme drought tolerance of the resurrection fern is in part the result of the dorsal scales that assist in water distribution and controlled desiccation. We studied the effect of peltate scales on water uptake and loss of the desiccation-tolerant epiphytic fern Pleopeltis polypodioides using optical and FTIR microscopy and staining with calcofluor, solophenyl flavine7GFE, and Ruthenium Red. We provide information on structure, property, and function of the scales by measuring water uptake and dehydration, contact angles, and metabolic activity. Peltate scales mainly contain cellulose, xylogalactans, and pectin. Water is absorbed from the center of scales, and the overlapping arrangement of scales facilitates surface spreading of water. Intact fronds hydrated fully within 5 h of imbibition of the apical pinna, without scales water uptake stopped after 1 h. Hydration rates via rhizomes followed a longer time course but also improved in the presence of scales. Fronds with and without scales lost half of their water content in 15 or 4 h, respectively. The overall metabolism of rapidly dehydrated fronds was significantly reduced compared with slowly dehydrated fronds. Thus, water management and metabolism of Pleopeltis are dependent on surface properties determined by peltate scales.
