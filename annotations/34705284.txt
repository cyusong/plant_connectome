Heat stress is a major abiotic stress for plants, which can generate a range of biochemical and genetic responses. In 'Ponkan' mandarin fruit, hot air treatment (HAT) accelerates the degradation of citric acid. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of citrate degradation in response to HAT remain to be elucidated. Here, 17 heat shock transcription factor sequences were isolated, and dual-luciferase assays were employed to investigate whether the encoded proteins that could trans-activate the promoters of key genes in the GABA shunt, involved in citrate metabolism. We identified four heat shock transcription factors (CitHsfA7, CitHsfA3, CitHsfA4b and CitHsfA8) that showed trans-activation effects on CitAco3, CitIDH3 and CitGAD4, respectively. Transient expression of the CitHsfs in citrus fruits indicated that CitHsfA7 was the only factor that resulted in a significant lowering of the citric acid content, and these results were confirmed by a virus-induced gene silencing system (VIGS). Sub-cellar localization showed that CitHsfA7 is located in the nucleus and is capable of binding directly to a putative HSE in the CitAco3 promoter and enhance its expression. We proposed that the induction of CitHsfA7 transcript level contributes to citric acid degradation in citrus fruit, via modulation of CitAco3 in response to HAT.
