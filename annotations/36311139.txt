Photoinhibition decreases photosynthetic capacity and can therefore affect the plant survival, growth, and distribution, but little is known about how it affects on kindred tree species. We conducted field experiments to measure the photosynthetic, growth and physiological performances of two maple species (<i>Acer mono</i> and <i>A. pseudosieboldianum</i>) seedlings at four light intensities (100%, 75%, 55%, and 20% of full light) and evaluated the adaptability of seedlings. We found that: (1) <i>A. mono</i> seedlings have larger light saturated photosynthetic rates (<i>A</i> <sub>max</sub>), the light saturation point (LSP), and lower light compensation point (LCP) than <i>A. pseudosieboldianum</i> seedlings, thus indicating that the former has a stronger light utilization ability. (2) <i>A. mono</i> seedlings under 75% light intensity and had higher seedling height (SH), basal stem diameter (BSD), leaf number (LN), leaf area per plant (LAPP) and total dry weight (TDW), while <i>A. pseudosieboldianum</i> seedling at 55% light intensity displayed greater growth advantages, which agreed with their response of light saturated photosynthetic rate. Morphological plasticity adjustments such as decreased root shoot ratio (RSR) and increased specific leaf area (SLA) showed how seedlings adapt to weak light environments. (3) 100% and 20% light intensities increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of two maple seedlings, indicating that very strong or very weak light could lead to the imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. The regulation of antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT), as well as the content of osmoregulation substances such as free proline and soluble protein, are the main mechanisms of plant adaptation to light stress. Although both <i>A. mono</i> and <i>A. pseudosieboldianum</i> are highly shade tolerant, subtle differences in the photosynthetic, morphological and physiological traits underpinning their shade tolerance suggest <i>A. pseudosieboldianum</i> has the advantage to deal with the light threat. Future studies should focus on the expression level of photosynthesis-related genes and cell, to better understand the adaptation mechanism of plants to light variation which facilitates forest development, either natural or <i>via</i> silvicultural practices. This information expands our understanding of the light-regulating mechanism of trees, which contributes to develop management practices to support natural forest regeneration.
