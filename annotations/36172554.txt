Plants produce the volatile hormone ethylene to regulate many developmental processes and to deal with (a)biotic stressors. In seed plants, ethylene is synthesized from 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by the dedicated enzyme ACC oxidase (ACO). Ethylene biosynthesis is tightly regulated at the level of ACC through ACC synthesis, conjugation and transport. ACC is a non-proteinogenic amino acid, which also has signaling roles independent from ethylene. In this work, we investigated the biological function of an uncharacterized ACC dipeptide. The custom-synthesized di-ACC molecule can be taken up by Arabidopsis in a similar way as ACC, in part <i>via</i> Lysine Histidine Transporters (e.g., LHT1). Using Nano-Particle Assisted Laser Desoprtion/Ionization (Nano-PALDI) mass-spectrometry imaging, we revealed that externally fed di-ACC predominantly localizes to the vasculature tissue, despite it not being detectable in control hypocotyl segments. Once taken up, the ACC dimer can evoke a triple response phenotype in dark-grown seedlings, reminiscent of ethylene responses induced by ACC itself, albeit less efficiently compared to ACC. Di-ACC does not act <i>via</i> ACC-signaling, but operates <i>via</i> the known ethylene signaling pathway. <i>In vitro</i> ACO activity and molecular docking showed that di-ACC can be used as an alternative substrate by ACO to form ethylene. The promiscuous nature of ACO for the ACC dimer also explains the higher ethylene production rates observed <i>in planta</i>, although this reaction occurred less efficiently compared to ACC. Overall, the ACC dipeptide seems to be transported and converted into ethylene in a similar way as ACC, and is able to augment ethylene production levels and induce subsequent ethylene responses in Arabidopsis.
