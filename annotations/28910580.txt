In plants, cell wall bound phenolics change in response to stress. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of NaCl induced stress on wall bound phenolics in four rice varieties, of which two (Bhutnath, Nonabokra) were salt tolerant and two (MTU 7029, Sujala) were salt sensitive. After germination, seedlings were grown in hydroponic solution and subjected to salinity stress (25 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM and 150 mM NaCl) on day 12. Wall bound phenolic compounds were determined by GC-MS based metabolite analysis. Total seven wall bound phenols were identified from the leaf tissues and eight from the root tissues. Ferulic acid and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid were found in all the four varieties. After NaCl treatment, these two wall bound phenols increased in the leaves of tolerant varieties only. Significant inverse correlation between leaf length and leaf fresh weight with wall bound ferulic acid and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid in Nonabokra suggests the positive role of these wall bound phenolics in salt tolerance.
