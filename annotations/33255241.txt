To survive in stressful conditions, plants have developed multiple strategies to relieve damage. One of the strategies is to clear the damaged protein and organelles. Autophagy is a highly conservative degradation process, which refers to the recycling of damaged protein and organelles. Over the past decades, increasing evidence has revealed the important roles of autophagy in response to stress conditions, and many factors have been revealed involved in the sophisticated regulation of the autophagy signaling pathway. However, the accurate regulation pathway of the autophagy pathway is largely unknown. The current review proposes how stress-response factors respond to stress conditions involved in regulating the autophagy signaling pathway. In short, clarifying the regulating pathway of autophagy in response to stress conditions is beneficial to plant breeding.
