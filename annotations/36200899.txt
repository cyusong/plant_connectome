We review how a data infrastructure for the Plant Cell Atlas might be built using existing infrastructure and platforms. The Human Cell Atlas has developed an extensive infrastructure for human and mouse single cell data, while the European Bioinformatics Institute has developed a Single Cell Expression Atlas, that currently houses several plant data sets. We discuss issues related to appropriate ontologies for describing a plant single cell experiment. We imagine how such an infrastructure will enable biologists and data scientists to glean new insights into plant biology in the coming decades, as long as such data are made accessible to the community in an open manner.
