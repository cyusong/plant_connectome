Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play roles in various biological processes, but their functions in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) response to <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that circRNAs are involved in the rice-<i>M. oryzae</i> interaction using comparative circRNA-sequencing and transgenic approaches. We identified 2932 high-confidence circRNAs from young leaves of the blast-resistant accession International Rice Blast Line Pyricularia-Kanto51-m-Tsuyuake (IR25) and the blast-susceptible accession Lijiangxin Tuan Heigu (LTH) under <i>M</i> <i>oryzae</i>-infected or uninfected conditions; 636 were detected specifically upon <i>M</i> <i>oryzae</i> infection. The circRNAs in IR25 were significantly more diverse than those in LTH, especially under <i>M. oryzae</i> infection. Particularly, the number of circRNAs generated per parent gene was much higher in IR25 than in LTH and increased in IR25 but decreased in LTH upon <i>M. oryzae</i> infection. The higher diversity of circRNAs in IR25 was further associated with more frequent 3' and 5' alternative back-splicing and usage of complex splice sites. Moreover, a subset of circRNAs was differentially responsive to <i>M</i> <i>oryzae</i> in IR25 and LTH. We further confirmed that circR5g05160 promotes rice immunity against <i>M</i> <i>oryzae</i> Therefore, our data indicate that circRNA diversity is associated with different responses to <i>M</i> <i>oryzae</i> infection in rice and provide a starting point to investigate a new layer of regulation in the rice-<i>M</i> <i>oryzae</i> interaction.
