The TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR (TCP) family proteins are plant-specific transcription factors that have been well-acknowledged for designing the architectures of plant branch, shoot, and inflorescence. However, evidence for their innovation and emerging role in abiotic stress has been lacking. In this study, we identified a total of 36 <i>TCP</i> genes in <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>, 50% more than that in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (i.e., 24). Comparative intra-genomes showed that such significant innovation was mainly due to the most recent whole genome duplication (rWGD) in <i>Populus</i> lineage around Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary after the divergence from <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Transcriptome analysis showed that the expressions of <i>PtrTCP</i> genes varied among leaf, stem, and root, and they could also be elaborately regulated by abiotic stresses (e.g., cold and salt). Moreover, co-expression network identified a cold-associated regulatory module including <i>PtrTCP31</i>, <i>PtrTCP10</i>, and <i>PtrTCP36</i>. Of them, <i>PtrTCP10</i> was rWGD-duplicated from <i>PtrTCP31</i> and evolved a strong capability of cold induction, which might suggest a neofunctionalization of <i>PtrTCP</i> genes and contribute to the adaptation of <i>Populus</i> lineage during the Cenozoic global cooling. Evidentially, overexpression of <i>PtrTCP10</i> into <i>Arabidopsis</i> increased freezing tolerance and salt susceptibility. Integrating co-expression network and <i>cis-</i>regulatory element analysis confirmed that PtrTCP10 can regulate the well-known cold- and salt-relevant genes (e.g., <i>ZAT10</i>, <i>GolS2</i>, and <i>SOS1</i>), proving that PtrTCP10 is an evolutionary innovation in <i>P. trichocarpa</i> response to environmental changes. Altogether, our results provide evidence of the rWGD in <i>P. trichocarpa</i> responsible for the innovation of <i>PtrTCP</i> genes and their emerging roles in environmental stresses.
