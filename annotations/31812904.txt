Inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation severely affects the normal growth and development of plants. Here, a Pi-responsive gene, named MdMYB2 (MDP0000823458), was cloned and functionally identified in apple. Overexpression of MdMYB2 regulated the expression of Pi starvation-induced (PSI) genes and then promoted phosphate assimilation and utilization. The ectopic expression of MdMYB2 in Arabidopsis influenced plant growth and flowering, which was partially rescued by application of exogenous gibberellin (GA). These results indicated that MdMYB2 may be an essential regulator in phosphate utilization and GA-regulated plant growth and development.
