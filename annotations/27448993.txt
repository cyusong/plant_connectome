Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade has been extensively studied in plants. Recently, this important network has been implicated in imparting submergence tolerance by facilitating the phosphorylation of the SUB1A1 protein. In this study, we try to examine the speculative role of MAPK cascade components in another rice mega-variety Pusa Basmati 1. The study reports that potential MAPK cascade components are triggered by submergence stress. Overall, the results provide a brief understanding of activation of MAPK cascade components post submergence stress in a rice variety, which does not harbor the SUB1A1, and in turn, succumbs to prolonged submergence stress.
