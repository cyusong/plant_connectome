['26069325', 'In multicellular organisms, temporal and spatial regulation of cell proliferation  is central for generating organs with defined sizes and morphologies. For  establishing and maintaining the post-mitotic quiescent state during cell  differentiation, it is important to repress genes with mitotic functions. We  found that three of the Arabidopsis MYB3R transcription factors synergistically  maintain G2/M-specific genes repressed in post-mitotic cells and restrict the  time window of mitotic gene expression in proliferating cells. The combined  mutants of the three repressor-type MYB3R genes displayed long roots, enlarged  leaves, embryos, and seeds. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed  that MYB3R3 binds to the promoters of G2/M-specific genes and to E2F target  genes. MYB3R3 associates with the repressor-type E2F, E2FC, and the  RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED proteins. In contrast, the activator MYB3R4 was in complex  with E2FB in proliferating cells. With mass spectrometry and pairwise interaction  assays, we identified some of the other conserved components of the multiprotein  complexes, known as DREAM/dREAM in human and flies. In plants, these repressor  complexes are important for periodic expression during cell cycle and to  establish a post-mitotic quiescent state determining organ size.', '2015 Aug 4', 'EMBO J', '10.15252/embj.201490899', 'Ito']
