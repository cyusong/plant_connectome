Betacyanins are a group of water-soluble red-violet compounds containing nitrogen in their structure. These are biosynthesized in red beetroot (<i>Beta vulgaris</i> L.), a widely consumed vegetable that contains significant amounts of nutritious and bioactive compounds which are also found in dietary supplements. This contribution presents results of betacyanin thermal oxidation (resulting in dehydrogenation) interrelated with decarboxylation in selected acetate/phosphate buffers at pH 3-8 and at 85 °C, which may be of particular significance for formulation and performance of foods. Most of the reaction products were detected at the highest concentrations in the acidic solutions (pH 3-4). The main dehydrogenation reaction pathways were monitored by LC-DAD-MS/MS and were associated with decarboxylation of the principal extract pigments, betanin/isobetanin and neobetanin, at carbon positions C-2 and C-17. Additional reactions are accompanied by the 2,15-decarboxylation processes at different dehydrogenation levels with 15-decarboxy-betanin and 2,15-bidecarboxy-betanin, structurally elucidated by NMR analysis, as the distinct indicators of this route type. For other novel pigments detected, 2,15-bidecarboxy-xanbetanin, 2,15-bidecarboxy-xanneobetanin and 2,15,17-tridecarboxy-neobetanin, additional high resolution mass spectrometric analyses were performed and confirmed their molecular formulas.
