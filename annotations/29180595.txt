<i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most abundant, internal, posttranscriptional modification in mRNA among all higher eukaryotes. In mammals, this modification is reversible and plays broad roles in the regulation of mRNA metabolism and processing. Despite its importance, previous studies on the role and mechanism of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> have been limited. Here, we report that ALKBH10B is a demethylase that oxidatively reverses m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in mRNA in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of ALKBH10B in the <i>alkbh10b</i> mutant delays flowering and represses vegetative growth. Complementation with wild-type <i>ALKBH10B</i>, but not a catalytically inactive mutant (<i>ALKBH10B H366A/E368A</i>), rescues these effects in <i>alkbh10b-1</i> mutant plants, suggesting the observed phenotypes are controlled by the catalytic action of <i>ALKBH10B</i> We show that <i>ALKBH10B</i>-mediated mRNA demethylation affects the stability of target transcripts, thereby influencing floral transition. We identified 1190 m<sup>6</sup>A hypermethylated transcripts in the <i>alkbh10b-1</i> mutant involved in plant development. The discovery and characterization of the archetypical RNA demethylase in Arabidopsis sheds light on the occurrence and functional role(s) of reversible mRNA methylation in plants and defines the role of m<sup>6</sup>A RNA modification in Arabidopsis floral transition.
