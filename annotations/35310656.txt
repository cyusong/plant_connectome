The tropical plant <i>Plumbago auriculata</i> can tolerate subzero temperatures without induction of apoptosis after cold acclimation in autumn, making it more cold tolerant than conventional tropical plants. In this study, we found that low temperatures significantly affected the photosynthetic system of <i>P. auriculata</i>. Using transcriptome sequencing, <i>PaDREB1A</i> was identified as a key transcription factor involved in the response to cold stress in <i>P. auriculata</i>. This transcription factor may be regulated by upstream JA signaling and regulates downstream <i>ERD4</i> and <i>ERD7</i> expression to resist cold stress. Overexpression of <i>PaDREB1A</i> significantly enhanced freezing resistance, protected the photosynthetic system, and enhanced the ROS scavenging mechanism under cold stress in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Additionally, <i>PaDREB1A</i> significantly enhanced the expression of <i>CORs</i> and <i>CAT1</i> in <i>A. thaliana</i>, which further activated the downstream pathway to enhance plant cold tolerance. This study explored the possible different regulatory modes of <i>CBFs</i> in tropical plants and can serve as an important reference for the introduction of tropical plants to low-temperature regions.
