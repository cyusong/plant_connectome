Plants secreted phytocytokine SMALL PHYTOCYTOKINES REGULATING DEFENSE AND WATER LOSS (SCREWs) and its receptor PLANT SCREW UNRESPONSIVE RECEPTOR (NUT) to counter abscisic acid (ABA)- and pathogen-induced stomatal closure (Liu et al.). This novel signaling process provides plants with a new strategy to increase immunity through disrupting an aqueous habitat for pathogen colonization.

SCREWs: !secreted by! Plants 
NUT: !receives! SCREWs 
ABA: !induces! Stomatal closure 
Pathogen: !induces! Stomatal closure 
SCREWs: !disrupts! Aqueous habitat 
Pathogen: !colonizes! Aqueous habitat
