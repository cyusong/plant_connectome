['22899078', 'Endomitosis and endoreplication are atypical modes of cell cycle that results in  genome duplication in single nucleus. Because the cell size of given cell type is  generally proportional to the nuclear DNA content, endoreplication and  endomitosis are effective strategy of cell growth, which are widespread in  multicellular organisms, especially those in plant kingdom. We found that these  processes might be differently regulated by GIGAS CELL1 (GIG1) and its paralog  UV-INSENSITIVE4 (UVI4) in Arabidopsis thaliana. GIG1 and UVI4 may negatively  regulate activities of anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin  ligase that acts as an important mitotic regulator. The gig1 mutation induced  ectopic occurrence of endomitosis during somatic cell division, while it has been  reported that uvi4 mutation resulted in premature occurrence of endoreplication  during organ development. Overexpression of GIG1 and UVI4 dramatically increased  the amount of mitotic cyclin, CYCB1;1, a well-known substrate of APC/C. Ectopic  endomitosis in gig1 was enhanced by mutation in CYCB2;2 and suppressed by  downregulation of APC10 encoding a core subunit of APC/C. Overexpression of  CDC20.1, an activator protein of APC/C, further promoted the ectopic endomitosis  in gig1. These findings suggest that endomitosis and endoreplication are  regulated by similar molecular mechanisms, in which two related proteins, GIG1  and UVI4, may inhibit APC/C in different ways.', '2012 Sep 1', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.21133', 'Ito']
