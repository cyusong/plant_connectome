['26586836', "The Hsp100-type chaperone Hsp93/ClpC has crucial roles in chloroplast biogenesis.  In addition to its role in proteolysis in the stroma, biochemical and genetic  evidence led to the hypothesis that this chaperone collaborates with the inner  envelope TIC complex to power preprotein import. Recently, it was suggested that  Hsp93, working together with the Clp proteolytic core, can confer a protein  quality control mechanism at the envelope. Thus, the role of envelope-localized  Hsp93, and the mechanism by which it participates in protein import, remain  unclear. To analyze the function of Hsp93 in protein import independently of its  ClpP association, we created a mutant of Hsp93 affecting its ClpP-binding motif  (PBM) (Hsp93[P-]), which is essential for the chaperone's interaction with the  Clp proteolytic core. The Hsp93[P-] construct was ineffective at complementing  the pale-yellow phenotype of hsp93 Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants,  indicating that the PBM is essential for Hsp93 function. As expected, the PBM  mutation negatively affected the degradation activity of the stromal Clp  protease. The mutation also disrupted association of Hsp93 with the Clp  proteolytic core at the envelope, without affecting the envelope localization of  Hsp93 itself or its association with the TIC machinery, which we demonstrate to  be mediated by a direct interaction with Tic110. Nonetheless, Hsp93[P-]  expression did not detectably improve the protein import efficiency of hsp93  mutant chloroplasts. Thus, our results do not support the proposed function of  Hsp93 in protein import propulsion, but are more consistent with the notion of  Hsp93 performing a quality control role at the point of import.", '2016 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.01538', 'ORCID:']
