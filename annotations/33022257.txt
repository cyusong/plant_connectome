There is longstanding interest in studying microbial communities below ground, while little attention has historically been paid to the above ground portions of plants (the phyllosphere). The phyllosphere has been estimated to make up around 60% of the biomass across all taxa on Earth, making it a key habitat for microbial organisms. The more we study these complex and dynamic communities, the more we come to realize their importance to the health of plant hosts. Overall, the phyllosphere is proving to be both an important microbial habitat and a tractable model system for asking questions in microbial ecology and evolution.
