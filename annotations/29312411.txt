['29312411', 'During double fertilization of angiosperms, the central cell of the female  gametophyte fuses with a sperm cell to produce the endosperm, a storage tissue  that nourishes the developing embryo within the seed. Although many genetic  mutants defective in female gametophytic functions have been characterized, the  molecular mechanisms controlling the specification and differentiation of the  central cell are still not fully understood. Here, we report a mitochondrial  ribosomal protein, RPS9M, is required for central cell maturation. RPS9M was  highly expressed in the male and female gametophytes before and after double  fertilization. The female gametophytes were defective in the rps9m mutant  specifically concerning maturation of central cells. The morphological defects  include unfused polar nuclei and smaller central vacuole in central cells. In  addition, embryo initiation and early endosperm development were also severely  affected in rps9m female gametophytes even after fertilized with wild type  pollens. The RPS9M can interact with ANK6, an ankyrin-repeat protein in  mitochondria previously reported to be required for fertilization. The expression  pattern and mutant phenotype of RPS9M are similar to those of ANK6 as well,  suggesting that RPS9M may work together with ANK6 in controlling female  gametophyte development, possibly by regulating the expression of some  mitochondrial proteins.', '2017', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2017.02171', 'Chen']
