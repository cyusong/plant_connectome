['14617065', 'Auxin/indole acetic acid (Aux/IAA) proteins regulate transcriptional responses to  the plant hormone auxin. Gain-of-function mutations in the Arabidopsis SHORT  HYPOCOTYL 2 (SHY2/IAA3) gene encoding an Aux/IAA protein increase steady-state  levels of SHY2/IAA3 protein and decrease auxin responses, indicating that  SHY2/IAA3 negatively regulates auxin signaling. These shy2 mutations also cause  ectopic light responses, suggesting that SHY2/IAA3 may promote light signaling.  Auxin regulates turnover of the related Auxin-resistant (AXR)2/IAA7 and  AXR3/IAA17 proteins by increasing their interaction with the  Skp1-Cdc53/cullin-F-box (SCFTIR1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. To investigate  whether SHY2/IAA3 is regulated similarly, we have used a turnover assay to reveal  that axr1 and transport inhibitor resistant (tir)1 mutations affecting SCFTIR1  decrease SHY2/IAA3 turnover. In pull-down assays, SHY2/IAA3 protein interacted  with TIR1, the F-box component of SCFTIR1 and with the photoreceptor phytochrome  B. Auxin stimulated SHY2/IAA3 interaction with TIR1, whereas the shy2-2  gain-of-function mutation decreased this interaction. Light did not affect the  interaction, suggesting that light regulates some other aspect of Aux/IAA gene or  protein function. The chemical juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) inhibited  the interaction, suggesting that peptidyl-prolyl isomerization may mediate  auxin-induced SHY2/IAA3 protein turnover.', '2003 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01909.x', 'Reed']
