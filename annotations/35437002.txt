When confronted with heat stress, plants depend on the timely activation of cellular defences to survive by perceiving the rising temperature. However, how plants sense heat at the whole-plant level has remained unanswered. Here we demonstrate that shoot apical nitric oxide (NO) bursting under heat stress as a signal triggers cellular heat responses at the whole-plant level on the basis of our studies mainly using live-imaging of transgenic plants harbouring pHsfA2::LUC, micrografting, NO accumulation mutants and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we validate that S-nitrosylation of the trihelix transcription factor GT-1 by S-nitrosoglutathione promotes its binding to NO-responsive elements in the HsfA2 promoter and that loss of function of GT-1 disrupts the activation of HsfA2 and heat tolerance, revealing that GT-1 is the long-sought mediator linking signal perception to the activation of cellular heat responses. These findings uncover a heat-responsive mechanism that determines the timing and execution of cellular heat responses at the whole-plant level.

NO: !triggers! cellular heat responses 
S-nitrosoglutathione: !S-nitrosylates! GT-1 
GT-1: !binds to! NO-responsive elements 
GT-1: !mediates! activation of HsfA2 
HsfA2: !activates! cellular heat responses
