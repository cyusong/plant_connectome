['9596631', 'Poikilothermic organisms require mechanisms that allow survival at chilling  temperatures (2 to 15 degreesC). We have isolated chilling-sensitive mutants of  Arabidopsis, a plant that is very chilling resistant, and are characterizing them  to understand the genes involved in chilling resistance. The T-DNA-tagged mutant  paleface1 (pfc1) grows normally at 22 degrees C but at 5 degrees C exhibits a  pattern of chilling-induced chlorosis consistent with a disruption of chloroplast  development. Genomic DNA flanking the T-DNA was cloned and used to isolate  wild-type genomic and cDNA clones. The PFC1 transcript is present at a low level  in wild-type plants and was not detected in pfc1 plants. Wild-type Arabidopsis  expressing antisense constructs of PFC1 grew normally at 22 degrees C but showed  chilling-induced chlorosis, confirming that the gene is essential for  low-temperature development of chloroplasts. The deduced amino acid sequence of  PFC1 has identity with rRNA methylases found in bacteria and yeast that modify  specific adenosines of pre-rRNA transcripts. The pfc1 mutant does not have these  modifications in the small subunit rRNA of the plastid.', '1998 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.5.699', 'Browse']
