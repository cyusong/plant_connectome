One central concept in island biology is that island assemblages form subsets of the mainland species pool, being disproportionately rich or poor in certain taxonomic groups. This unbalanced composition, termed 'disharmony', is generally explained using a taxon-centred approach, linking the over- or under-representation of taxa to their colonisation abilities. However, islands may also harbour 'functionally' disharmonic flora, being disproportionately rich or poor in species with certain traits, which may offer greater insights into the processes driving island colonisation. Here, we use orchids as a model to illustrate key processes involved in the formation of functionally disharmonic island floras, including filtering effects (for example biotic interactions), and speciation. Our synthesis is based on a comprehensive orchid dataset of 27 637 species and combines both a literature review and simple exploratory analyses to show that orchids are significantly under-represented on islands relative to mainland regions and that insular orchids display shifts in functional traits, from the shortening of nectar spurs to facilitate ornithophily to changes in colour associated with generalist insect pollinators. We highlight that taxa are simply coarse proxies and that we need to consider species traits and interactions to gain a full understanding of the processes constraining plant assembly on islands.
