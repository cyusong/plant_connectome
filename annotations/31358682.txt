During growth, plant cells must coordinate cell expansion and cell wall reinforcement by integrating distinct regulatory pathways in concert with intrinsic and external cues. However, the mechanism underpinning this integration is unclear, as few of the regulators that orchestrate cell expansion and wall strengthening have been identified. Here, we report a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Class II KNOX-like homeobox protein, <i>KNOTTED ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA7</i> (<i>KNAT7</i>), that interacts with different partners to govern cell expansion and wall thickening. A loss-of-function mutation in <i>KNAT7</i> enhanced wall mechanical strength and cell expansion, resulting in improved lodging resistance and grain size. Overexpression of <i>KNAT7</i> gave rise to the opposite phenotypes, with plants having weaker cell walls and smaller grains. Biochemical and gene expression analyses revealed that rice KNAT7 interacts with a secondary wall key regulator, NAC31, and a cell growth master regulator, Growth-Regulating Factor 4 (GRF4). The KNAT7-NAC31 and KNAT7-GRF4 modules suppressed regulatory pathways of cell expansion and wall reinforcement, as we show in internode and panicle development. These modules function in sclerenchyma fiber cells and modulate fiber cell length and wall thickness. Hence, our study uncovers a mechanism for the combined control of cell size and wall strengthening, providing a tool to improve lodging resistance and yield in rice production.
