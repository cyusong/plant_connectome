Flavones, a major group of flavonoids in most plant tissues, play multiple roles in plant-environment interactions. In our study, the expression of the two soybean flavone synthase genes, GmFNSII-1 and GmFNSII-2, was significantly increased by methyl jasmonate (MeJA), glucose, mannitol and NaCl treatment, which were also found to increase flavone aglycone accumulation in Glycine max (L.) Merrill. In the GmFNSII-1 promoter, a specific CGTCA motif in the region (-979 bp to -806 bp) involved in the MeJA response was identified. Promoter deletion analysis of GmFNSII-2 revealed the presence of osmotic-responsive (-1,143 bp to -767 bp) and glucose-repressive sequence elements (-767 bp to -475 bp), which strongly supported the hypothesis that glucose induces soybean flavone production by acting as both an osmotic factor and a sugar signaling molecule simultaneously. Silencing of the GmFNSII gene clearly reduced the production of flavone aglycones (apigenin, luteolin and 7,4'-dihydroxyflavone) in hairy roots. The GmFNSII-RNAi (RNA interference) roots that had a reduced level of flavones accompanied by more malondialdehyde and H2O2 accumulation were more sensitive to salt stress compared with those of the control, and we concluded that flavones, as antioxidants, are associated with salt tolerance.
