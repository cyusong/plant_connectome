Interfering RNA technology has been established as an effective strategy to protect plants against viral infection. Despite this success, interfering RNA (RNAi) has rarely been applied due to the regulatory barriers that confront genetically engineered plants and concerns over possible environmental and health risks posed by non-endogenous small RNAs. 'HoneySweet' was developed as a virus-resistant plum variety that is protected by an RNAi-mediated process against Sharka disease caused by the plum pox virus. 'HoneySweet' has been approved for cultivation in the United States but not in countries where the plum pox virus is endemic. In this study, we evaluated the long-term efficacy of virus resistance in 'HoneySweet,' the nature and stability of its sRNA profile, and the potential health risks of consuming 'HoneySweet' plums. Graft-challenged 'HoneySweet' trees carrying large non-transgenic infected limbs remained virus-free after more than 10 years in the field, and the viral sequences from the non-transgenic infected limbs showed no evidence of adaptation to the RNAi-based resistance. Small RNA profiling revealed that transgene-derived sRNA levels were stable across different environments and, on average, were more than 10 times lower than those present in symptom-less fruits from virus-infected trees. Comprehensive 90-day mouse feeding studies showed no adverse health impacts in mice, and there was no evidence for potential siRNA off-target pathologies predicted by comparisons of the most abundant transgene-derived sRNAs to the mouse genome. Collectively, the data confirmed that RNAi provides a highly effective, stable, and safe strategy to combat virus diseases in crop plants.
