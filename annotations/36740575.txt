Soybean is a major crop that produces valuable seed oil and protein for global consumption. Seed oil and protein are regulated by complex quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and have undergone intensive selections during the domestication of soybean. It is essential to identify the major genetic components and understand their mechanism behind seed oil and protein in soybean. We report that MOTHER-OF-FT-AND-TFL1 (GmMFT) is the gene of a classical QTL that has been reported to regulate seed oil and protein content in many studies. Mutation of MFT decreased seeds oil content and weight in both Arabidopsis and soybean, whereas increased expression of GmMFT enhanced seeds oil content and weight. Haplotype analysis showed that GmMFT has undergone selection, which resulted in the extended haplotype homozygosity in the cultivated soybean and the enriching of the oil-favorable allele in modern soybean cultivars. This work unraveled the GmMFT-mediated mechanism regulating seed oil and protein content and seed weight, and revealed a previously unknown function of MFT that provides new insights into targeted soybean improvement and breeding.
