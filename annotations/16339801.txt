['16339801', 'Heterotrimeric G proteins have been previously linked to plant defense; however a  role for the Gbetagamma dimer in defense signaling has not been described to  date. Using available Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants lacking  functional Galpha or Gbeta subunits, we show that defense against the  necrotrophic pathogens Alternaria brassicicola and Fusarium oxysporum is impaired  in Gbeta-deficient mutants while Galpha-deficient mutants show slightly increased  resistance compared to wild-type Columbia ecotype plants. In contrast, responses  to virulent (DC3000) and avirulent (JL1065) strains of Pseudomonas syringae  appear to be independent of heterotrimeric G proteins. The induction of a number  of defense-related genes in Gbeta-deficient mutants were severely reduced in  response to A. brassicicola infection. In addition, Gbeta-deficient mutants  exhibit decreased sensitivity to a number of methyl jasmonate-induced responses  such as induction of the plant defensin gene PDF1.2, inhibition of root  elongation, seed germination, and growth of plants in sublethal concentrations of  methyl jasmonate. In all cases, the behavior of the Galpha-deficient mutants is  coherent with the classic heterotrimeric mechanism of action, indicating that  jasmonic acid signaling is influenced by the Gbetagamma functional subunit but  not by Galpha. We hypothesize that Gbetagamma acts as a direct or indirect  enhancer of the jasmonate signaling pathway in plants.', '2006 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.069625', 'Botella']
