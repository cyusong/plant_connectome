Phosphorylation modification is required for the modulation of phytochrome B (phyB) thermal reversion, but the kinase(s) that phosphorylate(s) phyB and the biological significance of the phosphorylation are still unknown. Here we report that FERONIA (FER) phosphorylates phyB to regulate plant growth and salt tolerance, and the phosphorylation not only regulates dark-triggered photobody dissociation but also modulates phyB protein abundance in the nucleus. Further analysis indicates that phosphorylation of phyB by FER is sufficient to accelerate the conversion of phyB from the active form (Pfr) to the inactive form (Pr). Under salt stress, FER kinase activity is inhibited, leading to delayed photobody dissociation and increased phyB protein abundance in the nucleus. Our data also show that phyB mutation or overexpression of PIF5 attenuates growth inhibition and promotes plant survival under salt stress. Together, our study not only reveals a kinase that controls phyB turnover via a signature of phosphorylation, but also provides mechanistic insights into the role of the FER-phyB module in coordinating plant growth and stress tolerance.
