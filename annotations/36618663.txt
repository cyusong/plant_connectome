<i>Populus</i> (Salicaceae) species harbour rich biodiversity and are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. However, the origin and biogeography of <i>Populus</i> remain poorly understood. We infer the divergence times and the historical biogeography of the genus <i>Populus</i> through phylogenetic analysis of 34 chloroplast fragments based on a large sample. Eurasia is the likely location of the early divergences of Salicaceae after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction, followed by recurrent spread to the remainder of the Old World and the New World beginning in the Eocene; the extant <i>Populus</i> species began to diversity during the early Oligocene (approximately 27.24 Ma), climate changes during the Oligocene may have facilitated the diversification of modern poplar species; three separate lineages of <i>Populus</i> from Eurasia colonized North America in the Cenozoic via the Bering Land Bridges (BLB); We hypothesize that the present day disjunction in <i>Populus</i> can be explained by two scenarios: (i) <i>Populus</i> likely originated in Eurasia and subsequently colonized other regions, including North America; and (ii) the fact that the ancestor of the genus <i>Populus</i> that was once widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere and eventually wiped out due to the higher extinction rates in North America, similar to the African Rand flora. We hypothesize that disparities in extinction across the evolutionary history of <i>Populus</i> in different regions shape the modern biogeography of <i>Populus</i>. Further studies with dense sampling and more evidence are required to test these hypotheses. Our research underscores the significance of combining phylogenetic analyses with biogeographic interpretations to enhance our knowledge of the origin, divergence, and distribution of biodiversity in temperate plant floras.
