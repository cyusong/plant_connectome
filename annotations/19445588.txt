In addition to the resistance to Phytophthora infestans (Rpi) genes Rpi-blb1 and Rpi-blb2, Solanum bulbocastanum appears to harbor Rpi-blb3 located at a major late blight resistance locus on LG IV, which also harbors Rpi-abpt, R2, R2-like, and Rpi-mcd1 in other Solanum spp. Here, we report the cloning and functional analyses of four Rpi genes, using a map-based cloning approach, allele-mining strategy, Gateway technology, and transient complementation assays in Nicotiana benthamiana. Rpi-blb3, Rpi-abpt, R2, and R2-like contain all signature sequences characteristic of leucine zipper nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat (LZ-NBS-LRR) proteins, and share amino-acid sequences 34.9% similar to RPP13 from Arabidopsis thaliana. The LRR domains of all four Rpi proteins are highly homologous whereas LZ and NBS domains are more polymorphic, those of R2 being the most divergent. Clear blocks of sequence affiliation between the four functional resistance proteins and those encoded by additional Rpi-blb3 gene homologs suggest exchange of LZ, NBS, and LRR domains, underlining the modular nature of these proteins. All four Rpi genes recognize the recently identified RXLR effector PiAVR2.
