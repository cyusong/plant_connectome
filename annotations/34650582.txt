The Antarctic flowering plant <i>Deschampsia antarctica</i> is highly sensitive to climate change and has shown rapid population increases during regional warming of the Antarctic Peninsula. Several studies have examined the physiological and biochemical changes related to environmental stress tolerance that allow <i>D. antarctica</i> to colonize harsh Antarctic environments; however, the molecular mechanisms of its responses to environmental changes remain poorly understood. To elucidate the survival strategies of <i>D. antarctica</i> in Antarctic environments, we investigated the functions of actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) in this species. We identified eight <i>ADF</i> genes in the transcriptome that were clustered into five subgroups by phylogenetic analysis. DaADF3, which belongs to a monocot-specific clade together with cold-responsive ADF in wheat, showed significant transcriptional induction in response to dehydration and cold, as well as under Antarctic field conditions. Multiple drought and low-temperature responsive elements were identified as possible binding sites of C-repeat-binding factors in the promoter region of <i>DaADF3</i>, indicating a close relationship between DaADF3 transcription control and abiotic stress responses. To investigate the functions of DaADF3 related to abiotic stresses <i>in vivo</i>, we generated transgenic rice plants overexpressing <i>DaADF3</i>. These transgenic plants showed greater tolerance to low-temperature stress than the wild-type in terms of survival rate, leaf chlorophyll content, and electrolyte leakage, accompanied by changes in actin filament organization in the root tips. Together, our results imply that DaADF3 played an important role in the enhancement of cold tolerance in transgenic rice plants and in the adaptation of <i>D. antarctica</i> to its extreme environment.
