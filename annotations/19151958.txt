Sterility in the universally exploited PET1-CMS system of sunflower is associated with the expression of orfH522, a novel mitochondrial gene. Definitive evidence that ORFH522 is directly responsible for male sterility is lacking. To test the hypothesis that ORFH522 is sufficient to induce male sterility, a set of chimeric constructs were developed. The cDNA of orfH522 was cloned in-frame with yeast coxIV pre-sequence, and was expressed under tapetum-specific promoter TA29 (construct designated as TCON). For developing control vectors, orfH522 was cloned without the transit peptide under TA29 promoter (TON) or orfH522 was cloned with or without transit peptide under the constitutive CaMV35S promoter (SCOP and SOP). Among several independent transformants obtained with each of the gene cassettes, one third of the transgenics (6/17) with TCON were completely male sterile while more than 10 independent transformants obtained with each of the control vectors were fertile. The male sterile plants were morphologically similar to fertile plants, but had anthers that remained below the stigmatic surface at anthesis. RT-PCR analysis of the sterile plants confirmed the anther-specific expression of orfH522 and bright-field microscopy demonstrated ablation of the tapetal cell layer. Premature DNA fragmentation and programmed cell death was observed at meiosis stage in the anthers of sterile plants. Stable transmission of induced male sterility trait was confirmed in test cross progeny. This constitutes the first report at demonstrating the induction of male sterility by introducing orfH522 gene that could be useful for genetic engineering of male sterility.
