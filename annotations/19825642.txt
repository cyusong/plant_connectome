Pluripotent stem cells are able to both self-renew and generate undifferentiated cells for the formation of new tissues and organs. In higher plants, stem cells found in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and the root apical meristem (RAM) are origins of organogenesis occurring post-embryonically. It is important to understand how the regulation of stem cell fate is coordinated to enable the meristem to constantly generate different types of lateral organs. Much knowledge has accumulated on specific transcription factors controlling SAM and RAM activity. Here, we review recent evidences for a role of chromatin remodeling in the maintenance of stable expression states of transcription factor genes and the control of stem cell activity in Arabidopsis.
