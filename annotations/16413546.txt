The large number of ABC transporters in the Arabidopsis genome was made responsible for known as well as unexpected aspects in plant development. The combination of classical transport experiments with functional genomics approaches helped unravel some of these effects. Yet questions concerning the importance of this large number of ABC transporters in eukaryotic photosynthesizing organisms remain open. Phylogenomic analyses of whole genome sequence data reveal comparable sizes and composition between algae and higher plants within this protein family. Although this indicates the significance of ABC transporters in plants, several other questions remain to be answered.
