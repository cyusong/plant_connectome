Heat stress is a major growth-limiting factor for most crops over the world. Chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (<i>CERK1</i>) is a chitin/chitooligosaccharides receptor, and <i>ERECTA</i> (<i>ER</i>) plays a crucial role in plant resistance to heat stress. In the present study, a chitooligosaccharides-induced <i>CERK1n-ERc</i> fusion gene was designed and synthesized, in which the extracellular domain and transmembrane domain of <i>CERK1</i> gene is connected with the response region of <i>ER</i> gene. We successfully constructed the <i>CERK1n-ERc</i> fusion gene by Overlap PCR and introduced it into <i>Arabidopsis</i> by <i>Agrobacterium-medicated</i> infection. Genetically modified (GM) plants had a greater germination rate and germination index, as well as a shorter mean germination time, indicating that they had a better thermotolerance compared with the wild-type (WT) lines under heat stress. Moreover, the GM lines showed a lower level of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and relative electrolyte leakage (REL), suggesting that they were in better state compared with the WT plants when exposed to high temperature. UPLC-MS/MS was employed to assess the phytohormone level, suggesting that the GM lines acquired a better thermotolerance via jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways. In general, we constructed a COS-induced fusion gene to enhance the thermotolerance of <i>Arabidopsis</i> during seed germination and postgermination growth.
