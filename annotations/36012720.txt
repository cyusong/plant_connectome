Root systems are the key organs through which plants absorb water and nutrients and perceive the soil environment and thus are easily damaged by salt stress. Melatonin can alleviate stress-induced damage to roots. The present study investigated the effects of exogenous melatonin on the root physiology, transcriptome and metabolome of cotton seedlings under salt stress. Salt stress was observed to damage the cell structure and disorder the physiological system of cotton seedling roots. After subjecting melatonin-soaked seeds to salt stress, the activities of SOD, CAT and POD in cotton seedling roots increased by 10-25%, 50-60% and 50-60%, respectively. The accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA were significantly decreased by 30-60% and 30-50%, respectively. The contents of soluble sugar, soluble protein and K<sup>+</sup> increased by 15-30%, 15-30% and 20-50%, respectively, while the Na<sup>+</sup> content was significantly reduced. Melatonin also increased auxin (by 20-40%), brassinosteroids (by 5-40%) and gibberellin (by 5-35%) and promoted melatonin content and root activity. Exogenous melatonin maintained the integrity of root cells and increased the number of organelles. Transcriptomic and metabolomic results showed that exogenous melatonin could mitigate the salt-stress-induced inhibition of plant root development by regulating the reactive oxygen species scavenging system; ABC transporter synthesis; plant hormone signal transduction, endogenous melatonin gene expression; and the expression of the transcription factors MYB, TGA and WRKY33. These results provide a new direction and empirical basis for improving crop salt tolerance with melatonin.
