Southern corn rust (SCR) caused by <i>Puccinia polysora</i> Underw. poses a major threat to maize production worldwide. The utilization of host SCR-resistance genes and the cultivation of resistant cultivars are the most effective, economical strategies for controlling SCR. Here, we identified and cloned a new SCR resistance gene, <i>RppM</i>, from the elite maize inbred line Jing2416K. <i>RppM</i> was found to encode a typical CC-NBS-LRR protein localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. This gene was constitutively expressed at all developmental stages and in all tissues examined, with the strongest expression detected in leaves at the mature stage. A transcriptome analysis provided further evidence that multiple defense systems were initiated in Jing2416K, including pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity, reinforcement of cell walls, accumulation of antimicrobial compounds, and activation of phytohormone signaling pathways. Finally, we developed functional Kompetitive allele-specific PCR markers for <i>RppM</i> using two conserved SNP sites and successfully applied these functional markers for the detection of <i>RppM</i> and the cultivation of resistant maize cultivars, demonstrating their great potential utility in maize breeding.
