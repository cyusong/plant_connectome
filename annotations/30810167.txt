Phosphate (Pi) deficiency severely influences the growth and reproduction of plants. To cope with Pi deficiency, plants initiate morphological and biochemical adaptive responses upon sensing low Pi in the soil, and the plant hormone ethylene plays a crucial role during this process. However, how regulation of ethylene biosynthesis influences the Pi-induced adaptive responses remains unclear. Here, we determine the roles of rice 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS), the rate-limiting enzymes in ethylene biosynthesis, in response to Pi deficiency. Through analysis of tissue-specific expression of OsACS in response to Pi deficiency and OsACS mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 [clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9] genome editing, we found that two members of the OsACS family, i.e. OsACS1 and OsACS2, are involved but differed in their importance in controlling the remodeling of root system architecture, transcriptional regulation of Pi starvation-induced genes, and cellular phosphorus homeostasis. Interestingly, in contrast to the known inhibitory role of ethylene on root elongation, both OsACS mutants, especially OsACS1, almost fail to promote lateral root growth in response to Pi deficiency, demonstrating a stimulatory role for ethylene in lateral root development under Pi-deficient conditions. Together, this study provides new insights into the roles of ethylene in Pi deficiency response in rice seedlings and the isoform-specific function of OsACS genes in this process.
