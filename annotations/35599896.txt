A sample set of 18 sweet potatoes [<i>Ipomoea batatas</i> (L.) Lam] segmented into six registered cultivars and 12 new varieties were evaluated. The 142 tuberous roots were obtained from a sweet potato germplasm bank (BAG-sweet potato; -27.417713768824555 and -49.64874168439556), specifically from plants belonging to a sweet potato breeding program. All samples were characterized according to their morphology, instrumental pulp color, proximate composition, and total dietary fiber. The analytical results were submitted to parametric and non-parametric statistical tests for sample variance data comparison. Moreover, the screening of the cultivars and new varieties was performed by exploratory statistical analysis, factor analysis (FA), and principal component analysis (PCA). From the sixteen independent variables that characterized the samples, the exploratory FA identified thirteen that had a communality greater than 0.7, with 92.08% of assertiveness. The PCA generated 4 principal components able to account for 84.01% of the explanatory variance. So, among the six registered cultivars, SCS372 Marina and SCS370 Luiza showed the capability to be employed as cultivars for production. Among the 12 sweet potato new varieties, samples 17025-13, 17125-10, and 17117 met the requirements for patent and registration. These results will be useful to farmers who wish to use these sweet potatoes in the development of their crops.
