The C5 hemiterpenes isoprene and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO) are important biogenic volatiles emitted from terrestrial vegetation. Isoprene is emitted from many plant groups, especially trees such as <i>Populus</i>, while emission of MBO is restricted to certain North American conifers, including species of <i>Pinus</i>. MBO is also a pheromone emitted by several conifer bark beetles. Both isoprene and MBO have typically been measured by proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), but this method cannot accurately distinguish between them because of their signal overlap. Our study developed a method for using selective ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) that allows simultaneous on-line measurement of isoprene and MBO by employing different reagent ions. The use of <i>m</i>/<i>z</i>(NO<sup>+</sup>) = 68 u for isoprene and <i>m</i>/<i>z</i>(O<sub>2</sub> <sup>+</sup>) = 71 u for MBO gave minimal interference between the compounds. We tested the suitability of the method by measuring the emission of young trees of <i>Populus</i>, <i>Picea</i>, and <i>Pinus</i>. Our results largely confirm previous findings that <i>Populus nigra</i>, <i>Picea glauca</i>, and <i>Picea abies</i> emit isoprene and <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> emits MBO, but we also found MBO to be emitted by <i>Picea abies</i>. Thus SIFT-MS provides a reliable, easy to use, on-line measuring tool to distinguish between isoprene and MBO. The method should be of use to atmospheric chemists, tree physiologists and forest entomologists, among others.
