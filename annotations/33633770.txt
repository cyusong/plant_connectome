In many plants, isoflavones are the main secondary metabolites that have various pharmacological activities, but the low water solubility of aglycones limits their usage. The O-glycosylation of (iso)flavones is a promising way to overcome this barrier. O-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of (iso)flavonoid O-glycosides in plants. However, limited investigations on isoflavonoid O-UGTs have been reported, and they mainly focused on legumes. <i>Iris domestica (L.)</i> Goldblatt et Mabberley is a non-legume plant rich in various isoflavonoid glycosides. However, there are no reports regarding its glycosylation mechanism, despite the <i>I. domestica</i> transcriptome previously being annotated as having non-active isoflavone 7-O-UGTs. Our previous experiments indicated that isoflavonoid glycosides were induced by CuCl<sub>2</sub> in <i>I. domestica</i> calli; therefore, we hypothesized that isoflavone O-UGTs may be induced by Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed using <i>I. domestica</i> seedlings treated with CuCl<sub>2</sub>, and eight new active BcUGTs were obtained. Biochemical analyses showed that most of the active BcUGTs had broad substrate spectra; however, substrates lacking 5-OH were rarely catalyzed. Real-time quantitative PCR results further indicated that the transcriptional levels of BcUGTs were remarkably induced by Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Our study increases the understanding of UGTs and isoflavone biosynthesis in non-legume plants.
