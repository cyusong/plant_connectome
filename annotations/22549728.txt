['22549728', "RNase P is an essential enzyme that cleaves the 5' leader sequence of tRNA  precursors. RNase Ps were believed until now to occur universally as  ribonucleoproteins in organisms performing RNase P activity. Here we find that  protein-only RNase P enzymes called PRORP (for proteinaceous RNase P) support  RNase P activity in vivo in both organelles and the nucleus in Arabidopsis.  Beyond tRNA, PRORP proteins are involved in the maturation of small nucleolar RNA  (snoRNA) and mRNA. Finally, ribonucleoprotein RNase MRP is not involved in tRNA  maturation in plants. Altogether, our results indicate that ribonucleoprotein  enzymes have been entirely replaced by proteins for RNase P activity in plants.", '2012 May 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.189514.112', 'Giege']
