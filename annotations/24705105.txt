Autophagy, especially selective autophagy, is poorly characterized in plants compared with mammals and yeasts, where numerous factors required for the proper regulation of autophagy have been identified. The evidence for the importance of the cytoskeleton (both actin filaments and microtubules) in various aspects of autophagy comes mostly from work on yeasts and mammals, while in plant cells these links are poorly explored. In this report we demonstrate that tobacco protein Joka2, a member of a family of selective autophagy cargo receptors closely related to mammalian NBR1 and p62 colocalizes with both major cytoskeletal components, microtubules and microfilaments and, additionally, resides in close proximity of the ER.
