Zoysia japonica is an important warm-season turfgrass used worldwide. Although the draft genome sequence and a vast amount of next-generation sequencing data have been published, the current genome annotation and complete mRNA structure remain incomplete. Therefore, to analyze the full-length transcriptome of Z. japonica, we used the PacBio single-molecule long-read sequencing method in this study. First, we generated 37,056 high-confidence non-redundant transcripts from 16,005 gene loci. Next, 32,948 novel transcripts, 913 novel gene loci, 8035 transcription factors, 89 long non-coding RNAs, and 254 fusion transcripts were identified. Furthermore, 15,675 alternative splicing events and 5325 alternative polyadenylation sites were detected. In addition, using bioinformatics analysis, the underlying transcriptional mechanism of senescence was explored based on the revised reference transcriptome. This study provides a full-length reference transcriptome of Z. japonica using PacBio single-molecule long-read sequencing for the first time. These results contribute to our knowledge of the transcriptome and improve the knowledge of the reference genome of Z. japonica. This will also facilitate genetic engineering projects using Z. japonica.
