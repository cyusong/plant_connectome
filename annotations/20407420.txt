['20407420', 'Many core oscillator components of the circadian clock are nuclear localized but  how the phase and rate of their entry contribute to clock function is unknown.  TOC1/PRR1, a pseudoresponse regulator (PRR) protein, is a central element in one  of the feedback loops of the Arabidopsis clock, but how it functions is unknown.  Both TOC1 and a closely related protein, PRR5, are nuclear localized, expressed  in the same phase, and shorten period when deficient, but their molecular  relationship is unclear. Here, we find that both proteins interact in vitro and  in vivo through their conserved N-termini. TOC1-PRR5 oligomerization enhances  TOC1 nuclear accumulation two-fold, most likely through enhanced nuclear import.  In addition, PRR5 recruits TOC1 to large subnuclear foci and promotes  phosphorylation of the TOC1 N-terminus. Our results show that nuclear TOC1 is  essential for normal clock function and reveal a mechanism to enhance  phase-specific TOC1 nuclear accumulation. Interestingly, this process of  regulated nuclear import is reminiscent of similar oligomeric pairings in animal  clock systems (e.g. timeless/period and clock/cycle), suggesting evolutionary  convergence of a conserved mechanism across kingdoms.', '2010 Jun 2', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2010.76', 'Somers']
