['15266051', 'Transcriptomic and proteomic technologies are generating a wealth of data that  are frequently used by scientists to predict the function of proteins based on  their expression or presence. However, activity of many proteins, such as  transcription factors, kinases, and proteases, depends on posttranslational  modifications that frequently are not detected by these technologies. Therefore,  to monitor activity of proteases rather than their abundance, we introduce  protease activity profiling in plants. This technology is based on the use of  biotinylated, irreversible protease inhibitors that react with active proteases  in a mechanism-based manner. Using a biotinylated derivative of the Cys protease  inhibitor E-64, we display simultaneous activities of many papain-like Cys  proteases in extracts from various tissues and from different plant species.  Labeling is pH dependent, stimulated with reducing agents, and inhibited  specifically by Cys protease inhibitors but not by inhibitors of other protease  classes. Using one-step affinity capture of biotinylated proteases followed by  sequencing mass spectrometry, we identified proteases that include xylem-specific  XCP2, desiccation-induced RD21, and cathepsin B- and aleurain-like proteases.  Together, these results demonstrate that this technology can identify  differentially activated proteases and/or characterize the activity of a  particular protease within complex mixtures.', '2004 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.041467', 'Peck']
