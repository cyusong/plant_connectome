JAs are important hormones for plant development and defense, and JA signaling is regulated by diverse mechanisms. We have recently identified two RING-type ubiquitin ligases, RGLG3 and RGLG4, as essential JA signaling regulators. In this addendum, we discuss some characters of RGLG3 and RGLG4, which further support their important roles in JA pathway. RGLG3 and RGLG4 didn't interact with known key factors of the core JA pathway, rather, it might target on unknown protein that negatively regulated JA signaling. RGLG3 and RGLG4 expression was suppressed by SA treatment in an NPR1-independent manner, and rglg3 rglg4 moderated SA-inhibited JA-responsive PDF1.2 expression, suggesting RGLG3 and RGLG4 took roles in SA-JA antagonism. RGLG3 and RGLG4 could be important players of a regulatory network and coordinated diverse signals to modulate JA signaling.
