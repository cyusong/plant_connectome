['25524441', 'The activity of SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) is required for the functioning of the  shoot apical meristem (SAM). STM is expressed in the SAM but is down-regulated at  the site of leaf initiation. STM is also required for the formation of compound  leaves. However, how the activity of STM is regulated at the transcriptional,  posttranscriptional, and posttranslational levels is poorly understood. We  previously found two conserved noncoding sequences in the promoters of STM-like  genes across angiosperms, the K-box and the RB-box. Here, we characterize the  function of the RB-box in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The RB-box, along  with the K-box, regulates the expression of STM in leaf sinuses, which are areas  on the leaf blade with meristematic potential. The RB-box also contributes to  restrict STM expression to the SAM. We identified FAR1-RELATED SEQUENCES-RELATED  FACTOR1 (FRF1) as a binding factor to the RB-box region. FRF1 is an  uncharacterized member of a subfamily of four truncated proteins related to the  FAR1-RELATED SEQUENCES factors. Internal deletion analysis of the STM promoter  identified a region required to repress the expression of STM in hypocotyls.  Expression of STM in leaf primordia under the control of the JAGGED promoter  produced plants with partially undifferentiated leaves. We further found that the  ELK domain has a role in the posttranslational regulation of STM by affecting the  nuclear localization of STM.', '2015 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.248625', 'ORCID:']
