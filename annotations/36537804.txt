Fungal genus <i>Septoria</i> causes diseases in a wide range of plants. Here, we report the first genome sequences of two strains of <i>Septoria linicola</i>, the causal agent of the pasmo disease of flax (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i>). The genome of the first strain, SE15195, was fully assembled in 16 chromosomes, while 35 unitigs were obtained for a second strain, SE14017. Structural annotations predicted 13,096 and 13,085 protein-encoding genes and transposable elements content of 19.0 and 18.1% of the genome for SE15195 and SE14017, respectively. The four smaller chromosomes 13 to 16 show genomics features of potential accessory chromosomes. The assembly of these two genomes is a new resource for studying <i>S. linicola</i> and improving management of pasmo. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
