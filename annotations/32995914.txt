Rhizobium etli CE3-DsRed pMP604 drives infection 12-24 h earlier than R. etli CE3-DsRed and it is an excellent tool in live-cell imaging studies of IT developement in P. vulgaris roots. The study of the cellular dynamics of nodulation has frequently been limited by the difficulty of performing live-cell imaging in nodule primordia and legume roots, which are constituted by multiple cell layers, such is the case of Phaseolus vulgaris. Seeking conditions to reduce the time it takes for rhizobia to infect P. vulgaris root, we decided to explore the nodulation properties of Rhizobium etli CE3 pMP604, a strain that constitutively produces Nod factors through a flavonoids-independent transcriptional activation which is often used to purify Nod factors. Even though the strain infects 12-24 h earlier than the parental R. etli CE3 strain, infection thread (IT) formation, nodule organogenesis processes and N<sub>2</sub>-fixation activity are similar for both strains. Additionally, we have confirmed that R. etli CE3-DsRed pMP604 is an excellent tool to trace IT development in P. vulgaris roots.
