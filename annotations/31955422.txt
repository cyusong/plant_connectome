Photosynthetic rate is concurrently limited by stomatal limitations and nonstomatal limitations (NSLs). However, the controls on NSLs to photosynthesis and their coordination with stomatal control on different timescales remain poorly understood. According to a recent optimization hypothesis, NSLs depend on leaf osmotic or water status and are coordinated with stomatal control so as to maximize leaf photosynthesis. Drought and notching experiments were conducted on Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Betula Pendula and Populus tremula seedlings in glasshouse conditions to study the dependence of NSLs on leaf osmotic and water status, and their coordination with stomatal control, on timescales of minutes and weeks, to test the assumptions and predictions of the optimization hypothesis. Both NSLs and stomatal conductance followed power-law functions of leaf osmotic concentration and leaf water potential. Moreover, stomatal conductance was proportional to the square root of soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance, as predicted by the optimization hypothesis. Though the detailed mechanisms underlying the dependence of NSLs on leaf osmotic or water status lie outside the scope of this study, our results support the hypothesis that NSLs and stomatal control are coordinated to maximize leaf photosynthesis and allow the effect of NSLs to be included in models of tree gas-exchange.
