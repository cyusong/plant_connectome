Functions of exogenous L-ascorbic acid in plant roots are poorly understood. Recent study by Makavitskaya et al. (doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ery056) has demonstrated that exogenous ascorbate can be released from roots in response to salt stress, and can trigger elevation in the cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Here, we report that exogenous ascorbate significantly modifies root elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using a medium exchange technique, we have shown that 10-100 µM ascorbate induces small but significant increase in root elongation while higher levels cause its dramatic decrease. Root border cells of Pisum sativum have been losing viability twice faster in the presence of ascorbate that under control conditions, as tested by the confocal microscopy and a combined staining with propidium iodide and fluorescein diacetate.
