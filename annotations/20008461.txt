Ethylene regulates plant growth in response to many adverse environmental conditions, including the induction of aerenchyma, i.e. the formation of air spaces, in flooded roots in an effort to maintain oxygen levels. In this work, quantitative RT-PCR and in situ RNA hybridization were used to determine how the expression of the ethylene biosynthetic machinery in maize roots is spatially and temporally regulated following exposure to 4% oxygen (i.e. hypoxia) for up to 24 h, conditions that induced aerenchyma formation in the fully-expanded region of the root and reduced cytoplasmic density throughout the root. Expression of ACC oxidase, the ethylene forming enzyme, was observed in the root cap, protophloem sieve elements, and companion cells associated with metaphloem sieve elements. Exposure to 4% oxygen induced ACC oxidase expression in these cell types as well as in the root cortex. ACC synthase, which generates the ethylene precursor, was expressed in the root cap and the cortex and its expression was induced in cortical cells following low oxygen treatment. The induction of expression of the ethylene biosynthetic machinery was accompanied by an induction of ethylene evolution and a reduced rate of root growth. These results suggest that maize roots respond to conditions of hypoxia by inducing the spatially restricted expression of the ethylene biosynthetic machinery, resulting in increased ethylene production.
