The phytohormone auxin is a master regulator of plant growth and development in response to many endogenous and environmental signals. The underlying coordination of growth is mediated by the formation of auxin maxima and concentration gradients. The visualization of auxin dynamics and distribution can therefore provide essential information to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which auxin orchestrates these growth and developmental processes. Several auxin reporters have been developed to better perceive the auxin distribution and signaling machinery in vivo. This review focuses on different types of auxin reporters and biosensors used to monitor auxin distribution and its dynamics, as well as auxin signaling, at the cellular and tissue levels in different plant species. We provide a brief history of each reporter and biosensor group and explain their principles and utilities.
