['19097903', 'Plant organs are produced from meristems in a characteristic pattern. This  pattern, referred to as phyllotaxis, is thought to be generated by local  gradients of an information molecule, auxin. Some studies propose a key role for  the mechanical properties of the cell walls in the control of organ outgrowth. A  major cell-wall component is the linear alpha-1-4-linked D-GalAp pectic  polysaccharide homogalacturonan (HG), which plays a key role in cell-to-cell  cohesion. HG is deposited in the cell wall in a highly (70%-80%)  methyl-esterified form and is subsequently de-methyl-esterified by pectin  methyl-esterases (PME, EC 3.1.1.11). PME activity is itself regulated by  endogenous PME inhibitor (PMEI) proteins. PME action modulates cell-wall-matrix  properties and plays a role in the control of cell growth. Here, we show that the  formation of flower primordia in the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem is  accompanied by the de-methyl-esterification of pectic polysaccharides in the cell  walls. In addition, experimental perturbation of the methyl-esterification status  of pectins within the meristem dramatically alters the phyllotactic pattern.  These results demonstrate that regulated de-methyl-esterification of pectins is a  key event in the outgrowth of primordia and possibly also in phyllotactic  patterning.', '2008 Dec 23', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2008.10.065', 'Mouille']
