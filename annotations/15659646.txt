['15659646', 'Diverse kinesin motor proteins are involved in spindle function; however, the  mechanisms by which they are targeted to specific sites within spindles are not  well understood. Here, we show that a fusion between yellow fluorescent protein  (YFP) and a minus-end-directed Kinesin-14 (C-terminal family) from Arabidopsis,  ATK5, localizes to mitotic spindle midzones and regions rich in growing plus-ends  within phragmoplasts. Notably, in Arabidopsis interphase cells, YFP::ATK5  localizes to microtubules with a preferential enrichment at growing plus-ends;  indicating ATK5 is a plus-end tracking protein (+TIP). This +TIP activity is  conferred by regions outside of the C-terminal motor domain, which reveals the  presence of independent plus-end tracking and minus-end motor activities within  ATK5. Furthermore, mitotic spindles of atk5 null mutant plants are abnormally  broadened. Based on these data, we propose a model in which ATK5 uses plus-end  tracking to reach spindle midzones, where it then organizes microtubules via  minus-end-directed motor activity.', '2005 Apr', 'Mol Biol Cell', '10.1091/mbc.e04-10-0935', 'Cyr']
