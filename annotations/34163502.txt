Snow algae play crucial roles in cold ecosystems, however, many aspects related to their biology, adaptations and especially their diversity are not well known. To improve the identification of snow algae from colored snow, in the present study we used a polyphasic approach to describe a new Antarctic genus, <i>Chlorominima</i> with the species type <i>Chlorominima collina</i>. This new taxon was isolated of colored snow collected from the Collins Glacier (King George Island) in the Maritime Antarctic region. Microscopy revealed biflagellated ellipsoidal cells with a rounded posterior end, a C-shaped parietal chloroplast without a pyrenoid, eyespot, and discrete papillae. Several of these characteristics are typical of the genus <i>Chloromonas</i>, but the new isolate differs from the described species of this genus by the unusual small size of the cells, the presence of several vacuoles, the position of the nucleus and the shape of the chloroplast. Molecular analyzes confirm that the isolated alga does not belong to <i>Chloromonas</i> and therefore forms an independent lineage, which is closely related to other unidentified Antarctic and Arctic strains, forming a polar subclade in the <i>Stephanosphaerinia</i> phylogroup within the Chlamydomonadales. Secondary structure comparisons of the ITS2 rDNA marker support the idea that new strain is a distinct taxon within of <i>Caudivolvoxa</i>. Physiological experiments revealed psychrophilic characteristics, which are typical of true snow algae. This status was confirmed by the partial transcriptome obtained at 2°C, in which various cold-responsive and cryoprotective genes were identified. This study explores the systematics, cold acclimatization strategies and their implications for the Antarctic snow flora.
