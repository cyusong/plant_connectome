Small signalling peptides are key molecules for cell-to-cell communications in plants. The cysteine-rich signalling peptide, rapid alkalinisation factors (RALFs) family are involved in diverse developmental and stress responses and have expanded considerably during land plant evolution, implying neofunctionalisations in the RALF family. However, the ancestral roles of RALFs when land plant first acquired them remain unknown. Here, we functionally characterised two of the three RALFs in bryophyte Physcomitrium patens using loss-of-function mutants, overexpressors, as well as fluorescent proteins tagged reporter lines. We showed that PpRALF1 and PpRALF2 have overlapping functions in promoting protonema tip growth and elongation, showing a homologous function as the Arabidopsis RALF1 in promoting root hair tip growth. Although both PpRALFs are secreted to the plasma membrane on which PpRALF1 symmetrically localised, PpRALF2 showed a polarised localisation at the growing tip. Notably, proteolytic cleavage of PpRALF1 is necessary for its function. Our data reveal a possible evolutionary origin of the RALF functions and suggest that functional divergence of RALFs is essential to drive complex morphogenesis and to facilitate other novel processes in land plants.
