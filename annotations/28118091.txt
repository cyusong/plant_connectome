Paraburkholderia phytofirmans PsJN is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) that stimulates plant growth and improves tolerance to abiotic stresses. This study analyzed whether strain PsJN can reduce plant disease severity and proliferation of the virulent strain Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, in Arabidopsis plants, through the activation of induced resistance. Arabidopsis plants previously exposed to strain PsJN showed a reduction in disease severity and pathogen proliferation in leaves compared with noninoculated, infected plants. The plant defense-related genes WRKY54, PR1, ERF1, and PDF1.2 demonstrated increased and more rapid expression in strain PsJN-treated plants compared with noninoculated, infected plants. Transcriptional analyses and functional analysis using signaling mutant plants suggested that resistance to infection by DC3000 in plants treated with strain PsJN involves salicylic acid-, jasmonate-, and ethylene-signaling pathways to activate defense genes. Additionally, activation occurs through a specific PGPR-host recognition, being a necessary metabolically active state of the bacterium to trigger the resistance in Arabidopsis, with a strain PsJN-associated molecular pattern only partially involved in the resistance response. This study provides the first report on the mechanism used by the PGPR P. phytofirmans PsJN to protect A. thaliana against a widespread virulent pathogenic bacterium.
