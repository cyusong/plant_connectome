Chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis are affected by temperature. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains elusive. Here, we isolated and characterized a thermosensitive yellow-green leaf mutant named tsyl1 (thermosensitive yellow leaf 1) from an ethylmethylsulfone (EMS)-mutagenized pool of rice. The mutant exhibits a yellow-green leaf phenotype and decreased leaf chlorophyll contents throughout development. At the mature stage of the tsyl1 mutant, the plant height, tiller number, number of spikelets per panicle and 1000 seed weight were decreased significantly compared to those of wild-type plants, but the seed setting rate and panicle length were not. The mutant phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene on the short arm of rice chromosome 11. Map-based cloning of TSYL1, followed by a complementation experiment, showed a G base deletion at the coding region of LOC_Os11g05552, leading to the yellow-green phenotype. The TSYL1 gene encodes a signal recognition particle 54 kDa (SRP54) protein that is conserved in all organisms. The expression of tsyl1 was induced by high temperature. Furthermore, the expression of chlorophyll biosynthesis- and chloroplast development-related genes was influenced in tsyl1 at different temperatures. These results indicated that the TSYL1 gene plays a key role in chlorophyll biosynthesis and is affected by temperature at the transcriptional level.
