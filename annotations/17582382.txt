['17582382', 'We have investigated the covalent and secondary solution structure of caleosin, a  27-kDa protein also called ATS1 or AtClo1 (At4g26740) found within Arabidopsis  thaliana seed lipid bodies. The native protein was partly phosphorylated at S225.  Purified bacterially expressed caleosin (recClo) was not phosphorylated; cysteine  residues C221 and C230 were connected by a disulfide bridge. In solution it  exists as a mixture of predominant monomers and covalent dimers. We have used  recClo as a model for the study of AtClo1 secondary structure. recClo is folded  in aqueous solution (16% alpha-helix, 29% beta-sheet), its secondary structure  being dramatically influenced by the polarity of media, as deduced from CD  spectra measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of various  aliphatic alcohols.', '2007 Aug 15', 'Arch Biochem Biophys', '10.1016/j.abb.2007.04.041', 'Chardot']
