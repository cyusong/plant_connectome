Plants can successfully improve their resistance to previously lethal salinity stress by a short exposure to low levels of salt stress, a process known as salt acclimation (SA). In spite of its fundamental significance in theoretical study and agricultural practice, the molecular mechanisms underlying plant SA remain elusive. In this study, we found that salt acclimated Arabidopsis young seedlings can survive subsequent 200 mM NaCl stress. RNA-seq was performed to analyze the genome-wide transcriptional response under SA conditions. Among 518 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under SA, 366 up-regulated genes were enriched for cell wall biosynthesis, osmoregulation, oxidative stress, or transcription factors. Seven DEGs participate in the synthesis of lignin and 24 DEGs encode plant cell wall proteins, suggesting the importance of cell wall remodeling under SA. Furthermore, in comparison to non-acclimated salt stress, 228 of 245 DEGs were repressed by acclimated salt stress, including many genes related to ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway. In addition, MAPK6, a major component of the ethylene signaling pathway, was found to play a crucial role in SA. Our transcriptomic analysis has provided important insight on the roles of transcription factors, cell wall remodeling, and the ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathways during SA in Arabidopsis.
