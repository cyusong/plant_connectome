Faithful chromosome segregation is required for both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions and is regulated by multiple mechanisms including the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is the largest known E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex and has been implicated in regulating chromosome segregation in both mitosis and meiosis in animals. However, the role of the APC/C during plant meiosis remains largely unknown. Here, we show that Arabidopsis APC8 is required for male meiosis. We used a combination of genetic analyses, cytology and immunolocalisation to define the function of AtAPC8 in male meiosis. Meiocytes from apc8-1 plants exhibit several meiotic defects including improper alignment of bivalents at metaphase I, unequal chromosome segregation during anaphase II, and subsequent formation of polyads. Immunolocalisation using an antitubulin antibody showed that APC8 is required for normal spindle morphology. We also observed mitotic defects in apc8-1, including abnormal sister chromatid segregation and microtubule morphology. Our results demonstrate that Arabidopsis APC/C is required for meiotic chromosome segregation and that APC/C-mediated regulation of meiotic chromosome segregation is a conserved mechanism among eukaryotes.
