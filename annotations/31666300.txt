Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) plays critical roles in regulating growth and development as well as stress responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In this study, we used wild-type and HUB1 and HUB2 loss-of-function Arabidopsis plants to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the plant's defense responses to <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> toxins (Vd-toxins). We demonstrated that HUB-mediated H2Bub1 regulates the expression of the NADPH oxidase <i>RbohD</i> by enhancing the enrichment of histone H3 trimethylated on Lys-4 in response to Vd-toxins. <i>RbohD</i>-dependent hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) signaling is a critical modulator in the defense response against Vd-toxins. Moreover, H2Bub1 also affects posttranscriptional mitogen-activated protein kinase (or MPK) signaling. H2Bub1 was required for the activation of MPK3 and MPK6. MPK3 and MPK6 are involved in regulating <i>RbohD</i>-mediated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. MPK3 and MPK6 are associated with protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), such as Tyr-specific phosphatase1 and mitogen-activated protein kinases phosphatase1, which negatively regulated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. In addition, H2Bub1 is involved in regulating the expression of <i>WRKY33</i> WRKY33 directly binds to <i>RbohD</i> promoter and functions as a transcription factor to regulate the expression of <i>RbohD</i> Collectively, our results indicate that H2Bub1 regulates the NADPH oxidase <i>RbohD</i>-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and that the PTP-MPK3/6-WRKY pathway plays an important role in the regulation of <i>RbohD</i>-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> signaling in defense responses to Vd-toxins in Arabidopsis.
