Plant cell wall proteins (CWPs) play critical roles during plant development and in response to stresses. Proteomics has revealed their great diversity. With nearly 1000 identified CWPs, the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> cell wall proteome is the best described to date and it covers the main plant organs and cell suspension cultures. Other monocot and dicot plants have been studied as well as bryophytes, such as <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> and <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>. Although these proteomes were obtained using various flowcharts, they can be searched for the presence of members of a given protein family. Thereby, a core cell wall proteome which does not pretend to be exhaustive, yet could be defined. It comprises: (i) glycoside hydrolases and pectin methyl esterases, (ii) class III peroxidases, (iii) Asp, Ser and Cys proteases, (iv) non-specific lipid transfer proteins, (v) fasciclin arabinogalactan proteins, (vi) purple acid phosphatases and (vii) thaumatins. All the conserved CWP families could represent a set of house-keeping CWPs critical for either the maintenance of the basic cell wall functions, allowing immediate response to environmental stresses or both. Besides, the presence of non-canonical proteins devoid of a predicted signal peptide in cell wall proteomes is discussed in relation to the possible existence of alternative secretion pathways.
