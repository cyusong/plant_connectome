During ripening, fleshy fruits undergo irreversible changes in color, texture, sugar content, aroma, and flavor to appeal to seed-dispersal vectors. The onset of climacteric fruit ripening is accompanied by an ethylene burst. Understanding the factors triggering this ethylene burst is important for manipulating climacteric fruit ripening. Here, we review the current understanding and recent insights into the possible factors triggering climacteric fruit ripening: DNA methylation and histone modification, including methylation and acetylation. Understanding the initiation factors of fruit ripening is important for exploring and accurately regulating the mechanisms of fruit ripening. Lastly, we discuss the potential mechanisms responsible for climacteric fruit ripening.
