The ChillPeach database was developed to facilitate identification of genes controlling chilling injury (CI), a global-scale post-harvest physiological disorder in peach. It contained 7,862 high-quality ESTs (comprising 4,468 unigenes) obtained from mesocarp tissues of two full-sib progeny contrasting for CI, about 48 and 13% of which are unique to Prunus and Arabidopsis, respectively. All ESTs are in the Gateway vector to facilitate functional assessment of the genes. The data set contained several putative SNPs and 184 unigenes with high quality SSRs, of which 42% were novel to Prunus. Microarray slides containing 4,261 ChillPeach unigenes were printed and used in a pilot experiment to identify differentially expressed genes in cold-treated compared to control mesocarp tissues, and in vegetative compared to mesocarp tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed microarray results for all 13 genes tested. The microarray and qRT-PCR analyses indicated that ChillPeach is rich in putative fruit-specific and novel cold-induced genes. A website ( http://bioinfo.ibmcp.upv.es/genomics/ChillPeachDB ) was created holding detailed information on the ChillPeach database.
