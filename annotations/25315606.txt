['25315606', 'Size is a critical property of a cell, but how it is determined is still not well  understood. The sepal epidermis of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) contains  cells with a diversity of sizes ranging from giant cells to small cells. Giant  cells have undergone endoreduplication, a specialized cell cycle in which cells  replicate their DNA but fail to divide, becoming polyploid and enlarged. Through  forward genetics, we have identified a new mutant with ectopic giant cells  covering the sepal epidermis. Surprisingly, the mutated gene, SEC24A, encodes a  coat protein complex II vesicle coat subunit involved in endoplasmic  reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking in the early secretory pathway. We show that the  ectopic giant cells of sec24a-2 are highly endoreduplicated and that their  formation requires the activity of giant cell pathway genes LOSS OF GIANT CELLS  FROM ORGANS, DEFECTIVE KERNEL1, and Arabidopsis CRINKLY4. In contrast to other  trafficking mutants, cytokinesis appears to occur normally in sec24a-2. Our study  reveals an unexpected yet specific role of SEC24A in endoreduplication and cell  size patterning in the Arabidopsis sepal.', '2014 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.246033', 'ORCID:']
