Siebold's beech, <i>Fagus crenata</i>, is widely distributed across the Japanese Archipelago and islands in Japan Sea. Similar to the northern limit of the geographical distribution of <i>F. crenata</i> on the mainland of Hokkaido, the northern limit of the distribution of <i>F. crenata</i> on islands in the Japan Sea is observed on Okushiri Island (ca 42°<i>N</i>). To understand the genetic relationships of <i>F. crenata</i> on Okushiri Island, we examined chloroplast (cp) DNA haplotypes and 11 nuclear microsatellite (SSR) loci among 1,838 individuals from 44 populations from Okushiri Island, mainland Hokkaido, and the northern part of the Tohoku region on Honshu Island. We identified 2 cpDNA haplotypes, which represent not only populations on the Japan Sea coast but also those on the Pacific coast and this suggested the Okushiri Island populations might not be formed by single colonization. Genetic diversity of the Okushiri Island populations of nuclear SSR was not lower than the mainland and the STRUCTURE analysis revealed the Okushiri Island individuals were admixed between Hokkaido and Tohoku clusters. Approximate Bayesian computation inferred that divergence between Tohoku and Hokkaido, and admixture between two populations which generated Okushiri populations occurred before the last glacial maximum (LGM), that is, 7,890 (95% hyper probability density (HPD): 3,420 - 9,910) and 3,870 (95% HPD: 431- 8,540) generations ago, respectively. These inferences were well supported by a geological history which suggested an isolation of Okushiri Island from Hokkaido started prior to the Middle Pleistocene. We discuss the possible persistence of <i>F. crenata</i> during the last glacial maximum on northern islands in the Japan Sea such as Okushiri Island.
