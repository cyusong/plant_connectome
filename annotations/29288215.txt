['29288215', 'Germ-line specification is essential for sexual reproduction. In the ovules of  most flowering plants, only a single hypodermal cell enlarges and differentiates  into a megaspore mother cell (MMC), the founder cell of the female germ-line  lineage. The molecular mechanisms restricting MMC specification to a single cell  remain elusive. We show that the Arabidopsis transcription factor WRKY28 is  exclusively expressed in hypodermal somatic cells surrounding the MMC and is  required to repress these cells from acquiring MMC-like cell identity. In this  process, the SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex mediates the incorporation of the  histone variant H2A.Z at the WRKY28 locus. Moreover, the cytochrome P450 gene  KLU, expressed in inner integument primordia, non-cell-autonomously promotes  WRKY28 expression through H2A.Z deposition at WRKY28. Taken together, our  findings show how somatic cells in ovule primordia cooperatively use chromatin  remodeling to restrict germ-line cell specification to a single cell.', '2018 Jan 16', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1716054115', 'Qin']
