Improving photosynthesis is a promising avenue to increase crop yield. This will be aided by better understanding of natural variance in photosynthesis. Profiling of Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC) metabolites provides a top-down strategy to uncover inter-species diversity in CBC operation. In a study of four C4 and five C3 species, principal components analysis separated C4 species from C3 species and also separated different C4 species. These separations were driven by metabolites that reflect known species-differences in their biochemistry and pathways. Unexpectedly, there was also considerable diversity between the C3 species. Falling atmospheric CO2 and changing temperature, nitrogen and water availability have driven evolution of C4 photosynthesis in multiple lineages. We propose that analogous selective pressures drove lineage-dependent evolution of the CBC in C3 species. Examples of species-dependent variation include differences in the balance between the CBC and the light reactions, and in the balance between regulated steps in the CBC. Metabolite profiles also reveal conserved features including inactivation of enzymes in low irradiance, and maintenance of CBC metabolites at relatively high levels in the absence of net CO2 fixation. These features may be important for photosynthetic efficiency in low light, fluctuating irradiance and when stomata close due to low water availability.
