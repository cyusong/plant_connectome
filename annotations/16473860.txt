When the nodal end of an internodal cell of Chara corallina was subjected to a pulse treatment with artificial cell sap, a depolarization lasted in artificial pond water. This depolarization could also be induced by pulse treatment with KCl solution, indicating that K+ in the artificial cell sap is responsible (K+ -induced depolarization). The depolarization was prolonged in the presence of 2 mM KCl and the prolonged depolarization was terminated by supplementing with either CaCl2, MgCl2 or NaCl. These results supported the hypothesis that K+ released from the killed cell is responsible for generation of the wound-induced membrane depolarization.

K+: !induces! depolarization 
KCl solution: !induces! depolarization 
K+: !released from! killed cell 
2 mM KCl: !prolongs! depolarization 
CaCl2/MgCl2/NaCl: !terminates! prolonged depolarization
