['22158675', 'The cuticle is a complex aliphatic polymeric layer connected to the cell wall and  covers surfaces of all aerial plant organs. The cuticle prevents nonstomatal  water loss, regulates gas exchange, and acts as a barrier against pathogen  infection. The cuticle is synthesized by epidermal cells and predominantly  consists of an aliphatic polymer matrix (cutin) and intracuticular and  epicuticular waxes. Cutin monomers are primarily C(16) and C(18) unsubstituted,  omega-hydroxy, and alpha,omega-dicarboxylic fatty acids. Phenolics such as ferulate and  p-coumarate esters also contribute to a minor extent to the cutin polymer. Here,  we present the characterization of a novel acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent  acyl-transferase that is encoded by a gene designated Deficient in Cutin Ferulate  (DCF). The DCF protein is responsible for the feruloylation of omega-hydroxy fatty  acids incorporated into the cutin polymer of aerial Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) organs. The enzyme specifically transfers hydroxycinnamic acids using  omega-hydroxy fatty acids as acyl acceptors and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs, preferentially  feruloyl-CoA and sinapoyl-CoA, as acyl donors in vitro. Arabidopsis mutant lines  carrying DCF loss-of-function alleles are devoid of rosette leaf cutin ferulate  and exhibit a 50% reduction in ferulic acid content in stem insoluble residues.  DCF is specifically expressed in the epidermis throughout all green Arabidopsis  organs. The DCF protein localizes to the cytosol, suggesting that the  feruloylation of cutin monomers takes place in the cytoplasm.', '2012 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.187187', 'Scheller']
