Phytopathogens, such as biotrophs, hemibiotrophs and necrotrophs, pose serious stress on the development of their host plants, compromising their yields. Plants are in constant interaction with such phytopathogens and hence are vulnerable to their attack. In order to counter these attacks, plants need to develop immunity against them. Consequently, plants have developed strategies of recognizing and countering pathogenesis through pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Pathogen perception and surveillance is mediated through receptor proteins that trigger signal transduction, initiated in the cytoplasm or at the plasma membrane (PM) surfaces. Plant hosts possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (P/MAMPs), which trigger a complex set of mechanisms through the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and resistance (R) genes. These interactions lead to the stimulation of cytoplasmic kinases by many phosphorylating proteins that may also be transcription factors. Furthermore, phytohormones, such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene, are also effective in triggering defense responses. Closure of stomata, limiting the transfer of nutrients through apoplast and symplastic movements, production of antimicrobial compounds, programmed cell death (PCD) are some of the primary defense-related mechanisms. The current article highlights the molecular processes involved in plant innate immunity (PII) and discusses the most recent and plausible scientific interventions that could be useful in augmenting PII.
