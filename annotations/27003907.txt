During their sessile mode of life, plants need to endure variations in their environment such as a drastic variability in the nutrient concentration in soil solution. It is almost trivial to say that such fluctuations in the soil modify plant growth, development and phase transitions. However, the signaling pathways underlying the connections between nitrogen related signaling and hormonal signaling controlling growth are still poorly documented. This review is meant to present how nitrate/nitrogen controls hormonal pathways. Furthermore, it is very interesting to highlight the increasing evidence that the hormonal signaling pathways themselves seem to feed back control of the nitrate/nitrogen transport and assimilation to adapt nutrition to growth. This thus defines a feed-forward cycle that finely coordinates plant growth and nutrition.
