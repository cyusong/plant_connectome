Nitrogen availability has profound ecological consequences in nutrient-limited systems. In terrestrial settings these would include the upland heaths, sand dunes and blanket bogs of temperate latitudes. Understanding the physiological consequences of nitrogen enrichment is a first critical step in predicting possible consequences. Results are presented from a metabolic fingerprinting study using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to detect biochemical differences in the lichen Cladonia portentosa collected from 25 sites across mainland Britain varying in their nitrogen input. Partial least-squares regression analysis of the FTIR data demonstrated that changes in broad biochemical classes were consistently correlated with mean annual wet inorganic nitrogen deposition loads. These results demonstrated a direct coupling of a broad range of metabolic processes in C. portentosa to nitrogen deposition.
