Mesophyll conductance (g<sub>m</sub> ), the diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> from substomatal cavities to the carboxylation sites in the chloroplasts, is a highly complex trait driving photosynthesis (net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, A<sub>N</sub> ). However, little is known concerning the mechanisms by which it is dynamically regulated. The apoplast is considered as a 'key information bridge' between the environment and cells. Interestingly, most of the environmental constraints affecting g<sub>m</sub> also cause apoplastic responses, cell wall (CW) alterations and metabolic rearrangements. Since CW thickness is a key determinant of g<sub>m</sub> , we hypothesize that other changes in this cellular compartiment should also influence g<sub>m</sub> . We study the relationship between the antioxidant apoplastic system and CW metabolism and the g<sub>m</sub> responses in tobacco plants (Nicotiana sylvestris L.) under two abiotic stresses (drought and salinity), combining in vivo gas-exchange measurements with analyses of antioxidant activities, CW composition and primary metabolism. Stress treatments imposed substantial reductions in A<sub>N</sub> (58-54%) and g<sub>m</sub> (59%), accompanied by a strong antioxidant enzymatic response at the apoplastic and symplastic levels. Interestingly, apoplastic but not symplastic peroxidases were positively related to g<sub>m</sub> . Leaf anatomy remained mostly stable; however, the stress treatments significantly affected the CW composition, specifically pectins, which showed significant relationships with A<sub>N</sub> and g<sub>m</sub> . The treatments additionally promoted a differential primary metabolic response, and specific CW-related metabolites including galactose, glucosamine and hydroxycinnamate showed exclusive relationships with g<sub>m</sub> independent of the stress. These results suggest that g<sub>m</sub> responses can be attributed to specific changes in the apoplastic antioxidant system and CW metabolism, opening up more possibilities for improving photosynthesis using breeding/biotechnological strategies.
