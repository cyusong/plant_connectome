The rapeseed crop is susceptible to many pathogens such as parasitic plants or fungi attacking aerial or root parts. Conventional plant protection products, used intensively in agriculture, have a negative impact on the environment as well as on human health. There is therefore a growing demand for the development of more planet-friendly alternative protection methods such as biocontrol compounds. Natural rhamnolipids (RLs) can be used as elicitors of plant defense mechanisms. These glycolipids, from bacteria secretome, are biodegradable, non-toxic and are known for their stimulating and protective effects, in particular on rapeseed against filamentous fungi. Characterizing the organ responsiveness to defense-stimulating compounds such as RLs is missing. This analysis is crucial in the frame of optimizing the effectiveness of RLs against various diseases. A Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) labeling of the proteins extracted from the shoots and roots of rapeseed has been performed and showed a differential pattern of protein abundance between them. Quantitative proteomic analysis highlighted the differential accumulation of parietal and cytoplasmic defense or stress proteins in response to RL treatments with a clear effect of the type of application (foliar spraying or root absorption). These results must be considered for further use of RLs to fight specific rapeseed pathogens.
