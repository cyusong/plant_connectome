['10631260', 'Nuclease I enzymes are responsible for the degradation of RNA and single-stranded  DNA during several plant growth and developmental processes, including  senescence. However, in the case of senescence the corresponding genes have not  been reported. We describe the identification and characterization of BFN1 of  Arabidopsis, and demonstrate that it is a senescence-associated nuclease I gene.  BFN1 nuclease shows high similarity to the sequence of a barley nuclease induced  during germination and a zinnia (Zinnia elegans) nuclease induced during  xylogenesis. In transgenic plants overexpressing the BFN1 cDNA, a nuclease  activity of about 38 kD was detected on both RNase and DNase activity gels.  Levels of BFN1 mRNA were extremely low or undetectable in roots, leaves, and  stems. In contrast, relatively high BFN1 mRNA levels were detected in flowers and  during leaf and stem senescence. BFN1 nuclease activity was also induced during  leaf and stem senescence. The strong response of the BFN1 gene to senescence  indicated that it would be an excellent tool with which to study the mechanisms  of senescence induction, as well as the role of the BFN1 enzyme in senescence  using reverse genetic approaches in Arabidopsis.', '2000 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.122.1.169', 'Green']
