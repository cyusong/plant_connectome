['22307646', 'In all eukaryotic cells, a membrane-trafficking system connects the post-Golgi  organelles, such as the trans-Golgi network (TGN), endosomes, vacuoles, and the  plasma membrane. This complex network plays critical roles in several  higher-order functions in multicellular organisms. The TGN, one of the important  organelles for protein transport in the post-Golgi network, functions as a  sorting station, where cargo proteins are directed to the appropriate post-Golgi  compartments. Unlike its roles in animal and yeast cells, the TGN has also been  reported to function like early endosomal compartments in plant cells. However,  the physiological roles of the TGN functions in plants are not understood. Here,  we report a study of the SYP4 group (SYP41, SYP42, and SYP43), which represents  the plant orthologs of the Tlg2/syntaxin16 Qa-SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide  sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) that localizes on the TGN in yeast  and animal cells. The SYP4 group regulates the secretory and vacuolar transport  pathways in the post-Golgi network and maintains the morphology of the Golgi  apparatus and TGN. Consistent with a secretory role, SYP4 proteins are required  for extracellular resistance responses to a fungal pathogen. We also reveal a  plant cell-specific higher-order role of the SYP4 group in the protection of  chloroplasts from salicylic acid-dependent biotic stress.', '2012 Jan 31', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1115146109', 'Nakano']
