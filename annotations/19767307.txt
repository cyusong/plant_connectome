Crocus sativus is a triploid sterile plant characterized by its long red stigmas, which produce and store significant quantities of carotenoid derivatives formed from the oxidative cleavage of beta-carotene and zeaxanthin. The present study reports on the genomic structures of two lycopene-beta-cyclase genes, CstLcyB1 and CstLcyB2a, and on their transcription patterns in different C. sativus tissues. Phylogenetic analysis showed that both proteins are located in different groups: CstLcyB2a encodes chromoplast-specific lycopene cyclases, with an expression analysis showing strongly in flower stigmas where it activates and boosts beta-carotene accumulation. The CstLcyB1 transcript, however, was present in leaves, tepals, and stigmas at lower levels. In vivo assays in transgenic Arabidopsis demonstrated lycopene beta-cyclase activity of CstLcyB2a. CstLcyB2a is a CstLcyB1 paralogue derived through a gene duplication event, while promoter analysis showed that both genes have diverged in their regulatory sequences after duplication. Furthermore, it was found that the CstLcyB2a gene was absent from Crocus kotschyanus and, although present in C. goulimyi and C. cancellatus, the absence of transcripts suggests that transcriptional regulation of CstLcyB2a is responsible for the low apocarotenoid content in these species.
