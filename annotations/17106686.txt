The mechanical strength of cell walls in the tip-growing cells of Vaucheria terrestris is weakened by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. To clarify the morphological characteristics of the components maintaining cell wall strength, the fine structures of the cell walls, with and without protease treatment, were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Observations indicated that cellulose microfibrils were arranged in random directions and overlapped each other. Most of the microfibrils observed in the inner surface of the cell wall were embedded in amorphous materials, whereas in the outer surface of the cell wall, microfibrils were partially covered by amorphous materials. The matrix components embedding and covering microfibrils were almost completely removed by protease treatment, revealing layers of naked microfibrils deposited deeply in the cell wall. Topographic data taken from AFM observations provided some additional information that could not be obtained by TEM, including more detailed images of the granular surface textures of the matrix components and the detection of microfibrils in the interior of the cell wall. In addition, quantitative AFM data of local surface heights enabled us to draw three-dimensional renderings and to quantitatively estimate the extent of the exposure of microfibrils by the enzymatic treatment.
