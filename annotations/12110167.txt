['12110167', 'In a genetic screen for altered circadian period length in Arabidopsis, we  isolated a mutant with a long free-running period. The tej mutation acts  independently of light quality and quantity. It affects clock-controlled  transcription of genes in Arabidopsis and alters the timing of the  photoperiod-dependent transition from vegetative growth to flowering. Map-based  cloning of TEJ identified a poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). An inhibitor  of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation rescued the period phenotype of tej mutant and  shortened the period length of wild-type plants. Posttranslational  poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of an oscillator component may contribute to setting the  period length of the Arabidopsis central oscillator.', '2002 Jul', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/s1534-5807(02)00200-9', 'Kay']
