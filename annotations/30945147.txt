Overexpression of the poplar PP2C protein phosphatase gene PtrHAB2 resulted in increased tree height and altered leaf morphology and phyllotaxy, implicating PP2C phosphatases as growth regulators functioning under favorable conditions. We identified and studied Populus trichocarpa genes, PtrHAB1 through PtrHAB15, belonging to the clade A PP2C family of protein phosphatases known to regulate abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. PtrHAB1 through PtrHAB3 and PtrHAB12 through PtrHAB15 were the most highly expressed genes under non-stress conditions. The poplar PP2C genes were differentially regulated by drought treatments. Expression of PtrHAB1 through PtrHAB3 was unchanged or downregulated in response to drought, while all other PtrHAB genes were weakly to strongly upregulated in response to drought stress treatments. Yeast two-hybrid assays involving seven ABA receptor proteins (PtrRCAR) against 12 PtrHAB proteins detected 51 interactions involving eight PP2Cs and all PtrRCAR proteins with 22 interactions requiring the addition of ABA. PtrHAB2, PtrHAB12, PtrHAB13 and PtrHAB14 also interacted with the sucrose non-fermenting related kinase 2 proteins PtrSnRK2.10 and PtrSnRK2.11, supporting conservation of a SnRK2 signaling cascade regulated by PP2C in poplar. Additionally, PtrHAB2, PtrHAB12, PtrHAB13 and PtrHAB14 interacted with the mitogen-activated protein kinase protein PtrMPK7. Due to its interactions with PtrSnRK2 and PtrMPK7 proteins, and its reduced expression during drought stress, PtrHAB2 was overexpressed in poplar to test its potential as a growth regulator under non-stress conditions. 35S::PtrHAB2 transgenics exhibited increased growth rate for a majority of transgenic events and alterations in leaf phyllotaxy and morphology. These results indicate that PP2Cs have additional roles which extend beyond canonical ABA signaling, possibly coordinating plant growth and development in response to environmental conditions.
