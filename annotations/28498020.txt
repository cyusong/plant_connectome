Single-bud cuttings of Vitis vinifera L exposed to forced growing conditions were used to investigate the involvement of phytohormones, abscisic acid (ABA), auxin (Aux) and cytokinin (CK) in the release of buds from the ED and in bud-sprouting. This artificial system imitates and hastens the natural sprouting that occurs in spring. Temporal expression analysis of genes related to phytohormones synthesis, showed an early drop in the expression of ABA biosynthesis gene that preceded an increase in Aux and CK biosynthesis genes. Bud-break is headed by the activation of all structures of the latent bud, especially the differentiation of the inflorescence and the development of the early stages of floral organs. Therefore, resumption of cell division and increases in respiration are essential for the activation of the bud. Temporal expression analysis of the cell cycle and respiration genes indicate that an increase in cell division go before the increase in respiration. These results, together with results indicating that the cell cycle genes are upregulated by Aux and CK, suggest that the events before the bud-break, start with a reduction in ABA content, followed by an increase in the content of Aux and CK, which activates the machinery of the cell cycle, which eventually would cause an increase in respiration.

ABA: !decreases! Aux/CK
Aux/CK: !increases! Cell Division
Cell Division: !increases! Respiration
Aux/CK: !upregulates! Cell Cycle Genes
