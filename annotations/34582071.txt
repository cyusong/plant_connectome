['34582071', 'Rhomboid-like proteins are intramembrane proteases with a variety of regulatory  roles in cells. Though many rhomboid-like proteins are predicted in plants, their  detailed molecular mechanisms or cellular functions are not yet known. Of the 13  predicted rhomboids in Arabidopsis thaliana, one, RBL10, affects lipid metabolism  in the chloroplast, because in the respective rbl10 mutant the transfer of  phosphatidic acid through the inner envelope membrane is disrupted. Here we show  that RBL10 is part of a high-molecular-weight complex of 250 kDa or greater in  size. Nine likely components of this complex are identified by two independent  methods and include Acyl Carrier Protein 4 (ACP4) and Carboxyltransferase  Interactor1 (CTI1), which have known roles in chloroplast lipid metabolism. The  acp4 mutant has decreased C16:3 fatty acid content of  monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, similar to the rbl10 mutant, prompting us to offer  a mechanistic model of how an interaction between ACP4 and RBL10 might affect  chloroplast lipid assembly. We also demonstrate the presence of a seventh  transmembrane domain in RBL10, refining the currently accepted topology of this  protein. Taken together, the identity of possible RBL10 complex components as  well as insights into RBL10 topology and distribution in the membrane provide a  stepping-stone towards a deeper understanding of RBL10 function in Arabidopsis  lipid metabolism.', '2021 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.15514', 'ORCID:']
