['12228340', 'Threonine dehydratase/deaminase (TD), the first enzyme in the isoleucine  biosynthetic pathway, is feedback inhibited by isoleucine. By screening M2  populations of ethyl methane sulfonate-treated Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia  wild-type seeds, we isolated five independent mutants that were resistant to  L-O-methylthreonine, an isoleucine structural analog. Growth in the mutants was  50- to 600-fold more resistant to L-O-methylthreonine than in the wild type. The  resistance was due to a single, dominant nuclear gene that was denoted omr1 and  was mapped to chromosome 3 in GM11b, the mutant line exhibiting the highest level  of resistance. Biochemical characteristics (specific activities, Km, Vmax, and pH  optimum) of TD in extracts from the wild type and GM11b were similar except for  the inhibition constant of isoleucine, which was 50-fold higher in GM11b than in  the wild type. Levels of free isoleucine were 20-fold higher in extracts from  GM11b than in extracts from wild type. Therefore, isoleucine feedback  insensitivity in GM11b is due to a mutant form of the TD enzyme encoded by omr1.  The mutant allele omr1 of the line GM11b could provide a new selectable marker  for plant genetic transformation.', '1995 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.107.1.43', 'King']
