['26324904', "Plants produce diverse low-molecular-weight compounds via specialized metabolism.  Discovery of the pathways underlying production of these metabolites is an  important challenge for harnessing the huge chemical diversity and catalytic  potential in the plant kingdom for human uses, but this effort is often  encumbered by the necessity to initially identify compounds of interest or purify  a catalyst involved in their synthesis. As an alternative approach, we have  performed untargeted metabolite profiling and genome-wide association analysis on  440 natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. This approach allowed us to  establish genetic linkages between metabolites and genes. Investigation of one of  the metabolite-gene associations led to the identification of  N-malonyl-D-allo-isoleucine, and the discovery of a novel amino acid racemase  involved in its biosynthesis. This finding provides, to our knowledge, the first  functional characterization of a eukaryotic member of a large and widely  conserved phenazine biosynthesis protein PhzF-like protein family. Unlike most of  known eukaryotic amino acid racemases, the newly discovered enzyme does not  require pyridoxal 5'-phosphate for its activity. This study thus identifies a new  d-amino acid racemase gene family and advances our knowledge of plant d-amino  acid metabolism that is currently largely unexplored. It also demonstrates that  exploitation of natural metabolic variation by integrating metabolomics with  genome-wide association is a powerful approach for functional genomics study of  specialized metabolism.", '2015 Sep 15', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1503272112', 'Li']
