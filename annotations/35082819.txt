WRKY transcription factors (TFs) play crucial roles in the regulation of biotic stress. Citrus is the most productive fruit in the world. It is of great value to investigate the regulatory molecular mechanism of WRKYs in improving disease resistance. In this research, the transcription level of <i>CsWRKY25</i> was upregulated in <i>P. digitatum</i> infected citrus peel, and CsWRKY25 activated the expression of three target genes (<i>RbohB, RbohD</i>, and <i>PR10</i>). Besides, the <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transient overexpression of <i>CsWRKY25</i> has also been shown to enhance resistance to <i>P. digitatum</i> in citrus, and caused the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and lignin. The accumulation of ROS also activated the antioxidant system, the catalase (<i>CAT</i>), peroxidase (<i>POD</i>), and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (<i>CAD</i>) genes were significant upregulated, leading to activation of antioxidant enzymes. In addition, the up-regulated expression of <i>MPK5</i> and <i>MPK6</i> genes suggested that the regulatory role of CsWRKY25 might be related to the phosphorylation process. In conclusion, CsWRKY25 could enhance the resistance to <i>P. digitatum via</i> modulating ROS production and PR genes in citrus peel.
