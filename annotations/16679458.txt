['16679458', 'As a plant shoot matures, it transitions through a series of growth phases in  which successive aerial organs undergo distinct developmental changes. This  process of phase change is known to be influenced by gibberellins (GAs). We  report the identification of a putative transcription factor, GLABROUS  INFLORESCENCE STEMS (GIS), which regulates aspects of shoot maturation in  Arabidopsis thaliana. GIS loss-of-function mutations affect the epidermal  differentiation of inflorescence organs, causing a premature decrease in trichome  production on successive leaves, stem internodes, and branches. Overexpression  has the opposite effect on trichome initiation and causes other heterochronic  phenotypes, affecting flowering and juvenile-adult leaf transition and inducing  the formation of rosette leaves on inflorescence stems. Genetic and gene  expression analyses suggest that GIS acts in a GA-responsive pathway upstream of  the trichome initiation regulator GLABROUS1 (GL1) and downstream of the GA  signaling repressor SPINDLY (SPY). GIS mediates the induction of GL1 expression  by GA in inflorescence organs and is antagonized in its action by the DELLA  repressor GAI. The implication of GIS in the broader regulation of phase change  is further suggested by the delay in flowering caused by GIS loss of function in  the spy background. The discovery of GIS reveals a novel mechanism in the control  of shoot maturation, through which GAs regulate cellular differentiation in  plants.', '2006 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.041533', 'Broun']
