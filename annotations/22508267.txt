['22508267', 'The remarkable regeneration capability of plant tissues or organs under culture  conditions has underlain an extensive practice for decades. The initial step in  plant in vitro regeneration often involves the induction of a pluripotent cell  mass termed callus, which is driven by the phytohormone auxin and occurs via a  root development pathway. However, the key molecules governing callus formation  remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that Arabidopsis LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES  DOMAIN (LBD)/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE (ASL) transcription factors are involved in  the control of callus formation program. The four LBD genes downstream of AUXIN  RESPONSE FACTORs (ARFs), LBD16, LBD17, LBD18 and LBD29, are rapidly and  dramatically induced by callus-inducing medium (CIM) in multiple organs. Ectopic  expression of each of the four LBD genes in Arabidopsis is sufficient to trigger  spontaneous callus formation without exogenous phytohormones, whereas suppression  of LBD function inhibits the callus formation induced by CIM. Moreover, the  callus triggered by LBD resembles that induced by CIM by characteristics of  ectopically activated root meristem genes and efficient regeneration capacity.  These findings define LBD transcription factors as key regulators in the callus  induction process, thereby establishing a molecular link between auxin signaling  and the plant regeneration program.', '2012 Jul', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2012.63', 'Hu']
