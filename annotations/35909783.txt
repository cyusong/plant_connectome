The measurement of grapevine phenotypic parameters is crucial to quantify crop traits. However, individual differences in grape bunches pose challenges in accurately measuring their characteristic parameters. Hence, this study explores a method for estimating grape feature parameters based on point cloud information: segment the grape point cloud by filtering and region growing algorithm, and register the complete grape point cloud model by the improved iterative closest point algorithm. After estimating model phenotypic size characteristics, the grape bunch surface was reconstructed using the Poisson algorithm. Through the comparative analysis with the existing four methods (geometric model, 3D convex hull, 3D alpha-shape, and voxel-based), the estimation results of the algorithm proposed in this study are the closest to the measured parameters. Experimental data show that the coefficient of determination (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>) of the Poisson reconstruction algorithm is 0.9915, which is 0.2306 higher than the coefficient estimated by the existing alpha-shape algorithm (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.7609). Therefore, the method proposed in this study provides a strong basis for the quantification of grape traits.
