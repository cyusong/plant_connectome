['29288621', 'Fatty acids (FAs) and sterols constitute building blocks of eukaryotic membranes  and lipid signals. Co-regulation of FA and sterol synthesis is mediated by sterol  regulatory element-binding proteins in animals but remains elusive in plants. We  reported recently that Arabidopsis ACYL-COA-BINDING PROTEIN1 (ACBP1) modulates  sterol synthesis via protein-protein interaction with STEROL C4-METHYL OXIDASE1-1  (SMO1-1). Herein, ACBP1 was demonstrated to co-express and interact with SMO1-2  by yeast two-hybrid, co-localization, pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation and  beta-glucuronidase assays. SMO1-2 silenced in acbp1 was used in phenotyping, GC-MS  and expression profiling. ACBP1 co-expressed with SMO1-2 in embryo sacs, pollen  and trichomes, corroborating with cooperative tissue-specific functions unseen  with SMO1-1. SMO1-2 silencing in acbp1 impaired seed development, male and female  gamete transmission, and pollen function. Genes encoding homeodomain-leucine  zipper IV transcription factors (HDG5, HDG10, HDG11 and GLABRA2), which  potentially bind phospholipids/sterols, were transcribed aberrantly. GLABRA2  targets (MYB23, MUM4 and PLDalpha1) were misregulated, causing glabra2-resembling  trichome, seed coat mucilage and oil-accumulating phenotypes. Together with  altered sterol and FA compositions upon ACBP1 mutation and/or SMO1-2 silencing,  ACBP1-SMO1 interaction appears to mediate homeostatic co-regulation of FAs and  sterols, which serve as lipid modulators for gene expression of  homeodomain-leucine zipper IV transcription factors.', '2018 Apr', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.14965', 'ORCID:']
