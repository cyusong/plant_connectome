The WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are among the most diverse TF families of plants. They are implicated in various processes related to plant growth and stress response. Kenaf (<i>Hibiscus cannabinus</i> L.), an important fiber crop, has many applications, including the phytoremediation of saline-alkaline soil. However, the roles of WRKY TFs in kenaf are rarely studied. In the present study, 46 kenaf WRKY genes were genome-widely identified and characterized by gene structure, phylogeny and expression pattern analysis. Furthermore, the <i>HcWRKY44</i> gene was functionally characterized in <i>Arabidopsis</i> under salinity and drought stresses. HcWRKY44 is a nuclear-localized protein that is positively induced by salinity and drought, with roots showing maximum accumulation of its transcripts. Under NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) stress conditions, plants overexpressing <i>HcWRKY44</i> had higher germination rates, better root growth and increased survival than control plants; however, it did not improve the ability to withstand drought stress. Moreover, ABA signaling genes (<i>ABI1</i>, <i>ABI2</i>, and <i>ABI5</i>), ABA-responsive genes (<i>ABF4</i>, <i>RD29B</i>, <i>COR15A</i>, <i>COR47</i>, and <i>RD22</i>), stress-related genes (<i>STZ</i>, <i>P5CS</i>, and <i>KIN1</i>), and ionic homeostasis-related genes (<i>SOS1</i>, <i>AHA1</i>, <i>AHA2</i>, and <i>HKT1</i>) were positively induced in <i>HcWRKY44</i> transgenic plants under NaCl treatment. These results suggest that <i>HcWRKY44</i> improved plant's tolerance to salt stress but not osmotic stress through an ABA-mediated pathway. In summary, this study provides provided comprehensive information about <i>HcWRKY</i> genes and revealed that <i>HcWRKY44</i> is involved in salinity tolerance and ABA signaling.
