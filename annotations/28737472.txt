HD2D is one of the 4 plant specific HD2 family histone deacetylases (HDAC) identified in Arabidopsis and it is distantly related to the other HD2 members. At this time, little is known about the function of HD2D in plants. Here we provide evidence that HD2D is involved in the control of flowering time. Flowering was delayed in transgenic plants overexpressing HD2D and hd2d mutant plants flowered earlier compared with wild-type in both long day and short day conditions. Expression of several floral identity genes was altered in these plants. Taken together, our findings suggest that HD2D is a negative regulator of flowering that modulates the transition of vegetative to reproductive growth in a photoperiod independent manner.
