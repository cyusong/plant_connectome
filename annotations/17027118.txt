Brassinosteroids (BRs) are endogenous plant hormones essential for plant growth and development. Brassinosteroid insensitive1 (BRI1)-assocaiated receptor kinase (BAK1) is one of the key components in the BR signal transduction pathway due to its direct association with the BR receptor, BRI1. Although BRI1 and its orthologs have been identified from both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants, less is known about BAK1 and its orthologs in higher plants other than Arabidopsis. This article provides the first piece of evidence that AtBAK1 can greatly affect growth and development of rice plants when ectopically expressed, suggesting that rice may share similar BR perception mechanism via BRI1/BAK1 complex. Interestingly, transgenic rice plants displayed semi-dwarfism and shortened primary roots. Physiological analysis and cell morphology assay demonstrated that the observed phenotypes in transgenic plants were presumably caused by hypersensitivity to endogenous levels of BRs, different from BR insensitive and deficient rice mutants. Consistently, several known BR inducible genes were also upregulated in transgenic rice plants, further suggesting that BAK1 was able to affect BR signaling in rice. On the other hand, the transgenic plants generated by overproducing AtBAK1 may potentially have agricultural applications because the dwarfed phenotype is generally resistant to lodging, while the fertility remains unaffected.
