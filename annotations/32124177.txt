In light of the available discoveries in the field, this review manuscript discusses on plant reproduction mechanism and molecular players involved in the process. Sperm cells in angiosperms are immotile and are physically distant to the female gametophytes (FG). To secure the production of the next generation, plants have devised a clever approach by which the two sperm cells in each pollen are safely delivered to the female gametophyte where two fertilization events occur (by each sperm cell fertilizing an egg cell and central cell) to give rise to embryo and endosperm. Each of the successfully fertilized ovules later develops into a seed. Sets of macromolecules play roles in pollen tube (PT) guidance, from the stigma, through the transmitting tract and funiculus to the micropylar end of the ovule. Other sets of genetic players are involved in PT reception and in its rupture after it enters the ovule, and yet other sets of genes function in gametic fusion. Angiosperms have come long way from primitive reproductive structure development to today's sophisticated, diverse, and in most cases flamboyant organ. In this review, we will be discussing on the intricate yet complex molecular mechanism of double fertilization and how it might have been shaped by the evolutionary forces focusing particularly on the model plant Arabidopsis.
