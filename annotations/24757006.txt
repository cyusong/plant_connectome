['24757006', 'Asymmetric localization of PIN proteins controls directionality of auxin  transport and many aspects of plant development. Directionality of PIN1 within  the marginal epidermis and the presumptive veins of developing leaf primordia is  crucial for establishing leaf vein pattern. One mechanism that controls PIN  protein distribution within the cell membranes is endocytosis and subsequent  transport to the vacuole for degradation. The Arabidopsis mutant unhinged-1  (unh-1) has simpler leaf venation with distal non-meeting of the secondary veins  and fewer higher order veins, a narrower leaf with prominent serrations, and  reduced root and shoot growth. We identify UNH as the Arabidopsis vacuolar  protein sorting 51 (VPS51) homolog, a member of the Arabidopsis Golgi-associated  retrograde protein (GARP) complex, and show that UNH interacts with VPS52,  another member of the complex and colocalizes with trans Golgi network and  pre-vacuolar complex markers. The GARP complex in yeast and metazoans retrieves  vacuolar sorting receptors to the trans-Golgi network and is important in sorting  proteins for lysosomal degradation. We show that vacuolar targeting is reduced in  unh-1. In the epidermal cells of unh-1 leaf margins, PIN1 expression is expanded.  The unh-1 leaf phenotype is partially suppressed by pin1 and cuc2-3 mutations,  supporting the idea that the phenotype results from expanded PIN1 expression in  the marginal epidermis. Our results suggest that UNH is important for reducing  expression of PIN1 within margin cells, possibly by targeting PIN1 to the lytic  vacuole.', '2014 May', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.099333', 'Schultz']
