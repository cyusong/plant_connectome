<i>Verticillium dahliae</i> is a widespread fungal pathogen that causes Verticillium wilt on many economically important crops and ornamentals worldwide. Populations of <i>V. dahliae</i> have been divided into two distinct races based upon differential host responses in tomato and lettuce. Recently, the contemporary race 2 isolates were further divided into an additional race in tomato. Herein, we provide a high-quality reference genome for the race 1 strain VdLs.16 isolated from lettuce in California, U.S.A. This resource will contribute to ongoing research that aims to elucidate the genetic basis of <i>V. dahliae</i> pathogenicity and population genomic diversity.
