The long-distance translocation of nutrients and mobile molecules between different terminals is necessary for plant growth and development. Plasmodesmata-mediated symplastic trafficking plays an important role in accomplishing this task. To facilitate intercellular transport, plants have evolved diverse plasmodesmata with distinct internal architecture at different cell-cell interfaces along the trafficking route. Correspondingly, different underlying mechanisms for regulating plasmodesmal structures have been gradually revealed. In this review, we highlight recent studies on various plasmodesmal architectures, as well as relevant regulators of their de novo formation and transition, responsible for phloem loading, transport, and unloading specifically. We also discuss the interesting but unaddressed questions relating to, and potential studies on, the adaptation of functional plasmodesmal structures.
