Drought is the largest abiotic factor impacting agriculture. Plants are challenged by both natural and artificial stressors because they are immobile. To produce drought-resistant plants, we need to know how plants react to drought. A largescale proteome study of leaf and root tissue found drought-responsive proteins. Tomato as a vegetable is grown worldwide. Agricultural biotechnology focuses on creating drought-resistant cultivars. This is important because tomato drought is so widespread. Breeders have worked to improve tomato quality, production, and stress resistance. Conventional breeding approaches have only increased drought tolerance because of drought's complexity. Many studies have examined how tomatoes handle drought. With genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and modern sequencing technologies, it's easier to find drought-responsive genes. Biotechnology and in silico studies has helped demonstrate the function of drought-sensitive genes and generate drought-resistant plant types. The latest tomato genome editing technology is another. WRKY genes are plant transcription factors. They help plants grow and respond to both natural and artificial stimuli. To make plants that can handle stress, we need to know how WRKY-proteins, which are transcription factors, work with other proteins and ligands in plant cells by molecular docking and modeling study. Abscisic acid, a plant hormone generated in stressed roots, was used here to make plants drought-resistant. Abscisic acid binds WRKY with binding affinity -7.4kcal/mol and inhibitory concentration (Ki) 0.12 microM. This study aims to modulate the transcription factor so plants can handle drought and stress better. Therefore, polyphenols found to make Solanum lycopersicum more drought-tolerant.
