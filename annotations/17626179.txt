['17626179', 'In pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI), plant  cell surface receptors sense potential microbial pathogens by recognizing  elicitors called PAMPs. Although diverse PAMPs trigger PTI through distinct  receptors, the resulting intracellular responses overlap extensively. Despite  this, a common component(s) linking signal perception with transduction remains  unknown. In this study, we identify SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE  (SERK)3/brassinosteroid-associated kinase (BAK)1, a receptor-like kinase  previously implicated in hormone signaling, as a component of plant PTI. In  Arabidopsis thaliana, AtSERK3/BAK1 rapidly enters an elicitor-dependent complex  with FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2), the receptor for the bacterial PAMP flagellin  and its peptide derivative flg22. In the absence of AtSERK3/BAK1, early  flg22-dependent responses are greatly reduced in both A. thaliana and Nicotiana  benthamiana. Furthermore, N. benthamiana Serk3/Bak1 is required for full  responses to unrelated PAMPs and, importantly, for restriction of bacterial and  oomycete infections. Thus, SERK3/BAK1 appears to integrate diverse perception  events into downstream PAMP responses, leading to immunity against a range of  invading microbes.', '2007 Jul 17', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0705306104', 'Rathjen']
