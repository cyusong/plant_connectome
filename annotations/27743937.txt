Secreted signaling peptides or peptide hormones play crucial roles in plant growth and development through coordination of cell-cell communication. Perception of peptide hormones in plants generally relies on membrane-localized receptor kinases (RKs). Progress has recently been made in structural elucidation of interactions between posttranslationally modified peptide hormones and RKs. The structural studies suggest conserved receptor binding and activation mechanisms of this type of peptide hormones involving their conserved C-termini. Here, we review these structural data and discuss how the conserved mechanisms can be used to match peptide-RK pairs.

Peptide hormones: !coordinate! Cell-cell communication
RKs: !perceive! Peptide hormones
Peptide hormones: !bind and activate! RKs
Structural data: !match! Peptide-RK pairs
