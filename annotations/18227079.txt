C(4) plants have been reported to have Rubiscos with higher maximum carboxylation rates (kcat(CO(2))) and Michaelis-Menten constants (K(m)) for CO(2) (K(c)) than the enzyme from C(3) species, but variation in other kinetic parameters between the two photosynthetic pathways has not been extensively examined. The CO(2)/O(2) specificity (S(C/O)), kcat(CO(2)), K(c), and the K(m) for O(2) (K(o)) and RuBP (K(m-RuBP)), were measured at 25 degrees C, in Rubisco purified from 16 species of Flaveria (Asteraceae). Our analysis included two C(3) species of Flaveria, four C(4) species, and ten C(3)-C(4) or C(4)-like species, in addition to other C(4) (Zea mays and Amaranthus edulis) and C(3) (Spinacea oleracea and Chenopodium album) plants. The S(C/O) of the C(4) Flaveria species was about 77 mol mol(-1), which was approximately 5% lower than the corresponding value in the C(3) species. For Rubisco from the C(4) Flaverias kcat(CO(2)) and K(c) were 23% and 45% higher, respectively, than for Rubisco from the C(3) plants. Interestingly, it was found that the K(o) for Rubisco from the C(4) species F. bidentis and F. trinervia were similar to the C(3) Flaveria Rubiscos (approximately 650 microM) while the K(o) for Rubisco in the C(4) species F. kochiana, F. australasica, Z. mays, and A. edulis was reduced more than 2-fold. There were no pathway-related differences in K(m-RuBP). In the C(3)-C(4) species kcat(CO(2)) and K(c) were generally similar to the C(3) Rubiscos, but the K(o) values were more variable. The typical negative relationships were observed between S(C/O) and both kcat(CO(2)) and K(c), and a strongly positive relationship was observed between kcat(CO(2)) and Kc. However, the statistical significance of these relationships was influenced by the phylogenetic relatedness of the species.
