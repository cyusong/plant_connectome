Abiotic stresses severely affect plant growth and productivity. To cope with abiotic stresses, plants have evolved tolerance mechanisms that are tightly regulated by reprogramming transcription factors (TFs). APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factors are known to play an important role in various abiotic stresses. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms remains incomplete. In this study, we identified the role of <i>OsERF83</i>, a member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, in response to drought stress. OsERF83 is a transcription factor localized to the nucleus and induced in response to various abiotic stresses, such as drought and abscisic acid (ABA). Overexpression of <i>OsERF83</i> in transgenic plants (<i>OsERF83<sup>OX</sup></i>) significantly increased drought tolerance, with higher photochemical efficiency in rice. <i>OsERF83<sup>OX</sup></i> was also associated with growth retardation, with reduced grain yields under normal growth conditions. <i>OsERF83</i> is predominantly expressed in the vascular tissue of all organs. Transcriptome analysis revealed that <i>OsERF83</i> regulates drought response genes, which are related to the transporter (<i>OsNPF8.10, OsNPF8.17, OsLH1),</i> lignin biosynthesis (<i>OsLAC17, OsLAC10, CAD8D)</i>, terpenoid synthesis (<i>OsTPS33, OsTPS14, OsTPS3)</i>, cytochrome P450 family (<i>Oscyp71Z4, CYP76M10</i>), and abiotic stress-related genes (<i>OsSAP, OsLEA14, PCC13-62). OsERF83</i> also up-regulates biotic stress-associated genes, including <i>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEIN</i> (<i>PR</i>), <i>WALL-ASSOCIATED KINASE</i> (<i>WAK</i>), <i>CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE PROTEIN E1</i> (<i>CslE1</i>), and <i>LYSM RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE</i> (<i>RLK</i>) genes. Our results provide new insight into the multiple roles of <i>OsERF83</i> in the cross-talk between abiotic and biotic stress signaling pathways.
