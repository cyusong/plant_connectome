The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs), as one of the largest families of TFs, are essential regulators of plant terpenoid biosynthesis and response to stresses. Lavender has more than 75 volatile terpenoids, yet few TFs have been identified to be involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis. Based on RNA-Seq, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and transgenic technology, this study characterized the stress-responsive transcription factor LaMYC4 regulates terpenoid biosynthesis. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment increased volatile terpenoid emission, and the differentially expressed gene LaMYC4 was isolated. LaMYC4 expression level was higher in leaf than in other tissues. The expression of LaMYC4 decreased during flower development. The promoter of LaMYC4 contained hormone and stress-responsive regulatory elements and was responsive to various treatments, including UV, MeJA treatment, drought, low temperature, Pseudomonas syringae infection, and NaCl treatment. LaMYC4 overexpression increased the levels of sesquiterpenoids, including caryophyllenes, in Arabidopsis and tobacco plants. Furthermore, the expression of crucial node genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis and glandular trichome number and size increased in transgenic tobacco. We have shown that the stress-responsive MYC TF LaMYC4 from 'Jingxun 2' lavender regulates volatile terpenoid synthesis. This study is the first to describe the cloning of LaMYC4, and the results help understand the role of LaMYC4 in terpenoid biosynthesis.
