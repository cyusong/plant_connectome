* Here we analyzed the shape of the central vacuole of Acetabularia acetabulum by visualizing its development during diplophase (from juvenility through reproduction) and haplophase (from meiosis through mating). * Light microscopy and whole-organism applications of a pH-sensitive dye, neutral red, were used to visualize the anatomy of the central vacuole. We studied connectivity within the thallus by locally applying dye to morphologically distinct regions (rhizoid, stalk, apex, hairs) and observing dye movements. * In vegetative thalli most of the rhizoid, stalk and young hairs stained with dye. In reproductive structures (caps, gametangia) dye also stained the majority of the interiors. When applied to small areas, dye moved at different rates through each region of the thallus (e.g. within the stalk). Dye moved from younger hairs, but not from older hairs, into the stalk. Errors in incorporation of central vacuole into gametangia occurred at <10(-5). * These data indicate that the central vacuole of A. acetabulum is a ramified polar organelle with, potentially, a gel-like sap that actively remodels its morphology during development.
