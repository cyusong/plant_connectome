In plant cells, diverse environmental changes often induce transient elevation in the intracellular calcium concentrations, which are involved in signaling pathways leading to the respective cellular reactions. Therefore, these calcium elevations need to be deciphered into specific downstream responses. Calmodulin-like-proteins (CMLs) are calcium-sensing proteins present only in higher plants. They are involved in signaling processes induced by both abiotic as well as biotic stress factors. However, the role of CMLs in the interaction of plants with herbivorous insects is almost unknown. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana a number of CMLs genes (CML9, 11,12,16,17 and 23) are upregulated due to treatments with oral secretion of larvae of the herbivorous insect Spodoptera littoralis. We identified that these genes belong to two groups that respond with different kinetics to the treatment with oral secretion. Our data indicate that signaling networks involving multiple CMLs very likely have important functions in plant defense against insect herbivores, in addition to their involvement in many other stress-induced processes in plants.
