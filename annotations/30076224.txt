Aquaporins (AQPs) are ubiquitous water channels that facilitate the transport of many small molecules and may play multiple vital roles in aquatic environments. In particular, mechanisms to maintain transmembrane fluxes of important small molecules have yet to be studied in marine photoautotrophic organisms. Here, we report the occurrence of multiple AQPs with differential cellular localizations in marine diatoms, an important group of oceanic primary producers. The AQPs play a role in mediating the permeability of membranes to CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> In silico surveys revealed the presence of five AQP orthologs in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> and two in the centric diatom <i>Thalassiosira pseudonana</i> GFP fusions of putative AQPs displayed clear localization to the plasma membrane (PtAGP1 and PtAQP2), the chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum (CER; PtAGP1 and PtAQP3), and the tonoplast (PtAQP5) in <i>P. tricornutum</i> In <i>T. pseudonana</i>, GFP-AQP fusion proteins were found on the vacuole membrane (TpAQP1) and CER (TpAQP2). Transcript levels of both <i>PtAQP1</i> and <i>PtAQP2</i> were highly induced by ammonia, while only <i>PtAQP2</i> was induced by high (1%[v/v]) CO<sub>2</sub> Constitutive overexpression of GFP-tagged PtAQP1 and PtAQP2 significantly increased CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> permeability in <i>P. tricornutum</i>, strongly indicating that these AQPs function in regulating CO<sub>2</sub>/NH<sub>3</sub> permeability in the plasma membrane and/or CER. Cells carrying GFP-tagged PtAQP1 and PtAQP2 had higher nonphotochemical quenching under high light relative to that of wild-type cells, suggesting that these AQPs are involved in photoprotection. These AQPs may facilitate the efflux of NH<sub>3</sub>, preventing the uncoupling effect of high intracellular ammonia concentrations.
