Premature senescence greatly affects the yield production and the grain quality in plants, although the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we identified a novel rice <i>premature senescence leaf 85</i> (<i>psl85</i>) mutant from ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis of cultivar Zhongjian100 (the wild-type, WT). The <i>psl85</i> mutant presented a distinct dwarfism and premature senescence leaf phenotype, starting from the seedling stage to the mature stage, with decreasing level of chlorophyll and degradation of chloroplast, declined photosynthetic capacity, increased content of malonaldehyde (MDA), upregulated expression of senescence-associated genes, and disrupted reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging system. Moreover, endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) level was significantly increased in <i>psl85</i> at the late aging phase, and the detached leaves of <i>psl85</i> showed more rapid chlorophyll deterioration than that of WT under ABA treatment, indicating that <i>PSL85</i> was involved in ABA-induced leaf senescence. Genetic analysis revealed that the premature senescence leaf phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene which was finally mapped in a 47 kb region on the short arm of chromosome 7, covering eight candidate open reading frames (ORFs). No similar genes controlling a premature senescence leaf phenotype have been identified in the region, and cloning and functional analysis of the gene is currently underway.
