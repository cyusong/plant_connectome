['27468890', 'The molecular mechanism of pollen germination and pollen tube growth has been  revealed in detail during the last decade, while the mechanism that suspends  pollen grains in a dormant state is largely unclear. Here, we identified the  JINGUBANG (JGB) gene by screening pollen-specific genes for those that are  unnecessary for pollen germination. We showed that the pollen of the jgb  loss-of-function mutant exhibited hyperactive germination in sucrose-only medium  and inside the anther, while this phenotype was rescued by the transgenic  expression of JGB in jgb plants. JGB contains seven WD40 repeats and is highly  conserved in flowering plants. Overexpression of JGB inhibits pollen germination.  These results indicate that JGB is a novel negative regulator of pollen  germination. In addition, we found that jasmonic acid (JA) abundance was  significantly elevated in jgb pollen, while exogenous application of methyl  jasmonate rescued the inhibition of pollen germination in plants overexpressing  JGB Based on the molecular features of JGB and on the finding that it interacts  with a known JA biosynthesis-related transcription factor, TCP4, we propose that  JGB, together with TCP4, forms a regulatory complex that controls pollen JA  synthesis, ensuring pollination in moist environments.', '2016 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00401', 'Sodmergen']
