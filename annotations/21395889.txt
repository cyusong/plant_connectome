['21395889', 'Circadian clocks regulate many molecular and physiological processes in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), allowing the timing of these processes to  occur at the most appropriate time of the day in a 24-h period. The accuracy of  timing relies on the synchrony of the clock and the environmental day/night  cycle. Visible light is the most potent signal for such synchronization, but  light-induced responses are also rhythmically attenuated (gated) by the clock.  Here, we report a similar mutual interaction of the circadian clock and  non-damaging photomorphogenic UV-B light. We show that low-intensity UV-B  radiation acts as entraining signal for the clock. UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8)  and CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) are required, but ELONGATED  HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH) are dispensable for this process. UV-B  responsiveness of clock gene expression suggests that photomorphogenic UV-B  entrains the plant clock through transcriptional activation. We also demonstrate  that UV-B induction of gene expression under these conditions is gated by the  clock in a HY5/HYH-independent manner. The arrhythmic early flowering 3-4 mutant  showed non-gated, high-level gene induction by UV-B, yet displayed no increased  tolerance to UV-B stress. Thus, the temporal restriction of UV-B responsiveness  by the circadian clock can be considered as saving resources during acclimation  without losing fitness.', '2011 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04573.x', 'Nagy']
