Xylogen-like proteins (XYLPs) are essential for plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, little is known about the XYLP gene family in grape and its protective effects against gray mold a destructive disease caused by <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. We identified and characterized six common XYLPs in the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> genome (VvXYLPs). VvXYLP expression pattern analyses with <i>B. cinerea</i> infection showed that <i>VvXYLP02</i> was significantly up-regulated in the resistant genotype but down-regulated or only slightly up-regulated in the susceptible genotype. <i>VvXYLP02</i> overexpression in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> significantly increased resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i>, indicating that the candidate gene has functional importance. Furthermore, JA treatment significantly up-regulated <i>VvXYLP02</i> expression in <i>V. vinifera</i>. JA-responsive genes were also up-regulated in <i>VvXYLP02</i> overexpression lines in <i>A. thaliana</i> under <i>B. cinerea</i> inoculation. These findings suggest that VvXYLP02, which is induced by JA upon the pathogen infection, enhances JA dependent response to enforce plant resistance against gray mold disease.
