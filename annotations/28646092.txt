['28646092', 'AGD1, a plant ACAP-type ADP-ribosylation factor-GTPase activating protein  (ARF-GAP), functions in specifying root hair polarity in Arabidopsis thaliana To  better understand how AGD1 modulates root hair growth, we generated full-length  and domain-deleted AGD1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) constructs, and followed  their localization during root hair development. AGD1-GFP localized to the  cytoplasm and was recruited to specific regions of the root hair plasma membrane  (PM). Distinct PM AGD1-GFP signal was first detected along the site of root hair  bulge formation. The construct continued to mark the PM at the root hair apical  dome, but only during periods of reduced growth. During rapid tip growth,  AGD1-GFP labeled the PM of the lateral flanks and dissipated from the apical-most  PM. Deletion analysis and a single domain GFP fusion revealed that the pleckstrin  homology (PH) domain is the minimal unit required for recruitment of AGD1 to the  PM. Our results indicate that differential recruitment of AGD1 to specific PM  domains is an essential component of the membrane trafficking machinery that  facilitates root hair developmental phase transitions and responses to changes in  the root microenvironment.', '2018 Jan 29', 'J Cell Sci', '10.1242/jcs.203828', 'ORCID:']
