Programmed cell death (PCD) is an important form to protect plants from pathogen attack. However, plants must precisely control the PCD process under microbe attacks to avoid detrimental effects. The complexity of how plants balance the defense activation and PCD requires further clarification. Lesion mimic mutants constitute an excellent material to study the crosstalk between them. Here, we identified a <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> (cotton) lesion mimic mutant (<i>Ghlmm</i>), which exhibits necrotic leaf damage and enhanced disease resistance. Map-based cloning demonstrated that <i>GhLMMD</i>, encoding 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and located on chromosome D5, was responsible for the phenotype. The mutant was resulted from a nonsense mutation within the coding region of <i>GhLMMD</i> It exhibited an overaccumulation of the 5-aminolevulinic acid, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and salicylic acid, along with constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to the <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> infection. Interestingly, <i>GhLMM</i> plays a dosage-dependent role in regulating PCD of cotton leaves and resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> infection. This study provides a new strategy on the modulation of plant immunity, particularly in polyploidy plants.
