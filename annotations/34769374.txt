Plants employ a diversified array of defense activities when they encounter stress. Continuous activation of defense pathways that were induced by mutation or altered expression of disease resistance genes and mRNA surveillance mechanisms develop abnormal phenotypes. These plants show continuous defense genes' expression, reduced growth, and also manifest tissue damage by apoptosis. These macroscopic abrasions appear even in the absence of the pathogen and can be attributed to a condition known as autoimmunity. The question is whether it is possible to develop an autoimmune mutant that does not fetch yield and growth penalty and provides enhanced protection against various biotic and abiotic stresses via secondary metabolic pathways' engineering. This review is a discussion about the common stress-fighting mechanisms, how the concept of cross-tolerance instigates propitious or protective autoimmunity, and how it can be achieved by engineering secondary metabolic pathways.
