It has been suggested that establishment of one alien invader might promote further invasions. Such a so-called invasional meltdown could be mediated by differences in soil-legacy effects between alien and native plants. Whether such legacy effects might depend on the diversity of the invaded community has not been explored to date. Here, we conducted a two-phase plant-soil feedback experiment. In a soil-conditioning phase, we grew five alien and five native species as invaders in 21 communities of one, two or four species. In the subsequent test phase, we grew five alien and five native species on the conditioned soils. We found that growth of these test species was negatively affected by soils conditioned by both a community and an invader, and particularly if the previous invader was a conspecific (i.e. negative plant-soil feedback). Alien test species suffered less from soil-legacy effects of previous allospecific alien invaders than from the legacy effects of previous native invaders. However, this effect decreased when the soil had been co-conditioned by a multispecies community. Our findings suggest that plant-soil feedback-mediated invasional meltdown may depend on community diversity and therefore provide some evidence that diverse communities could increase resistance against subsequent alien invasions.
