Soybean [<i>Glycine max</i> (L.) Merri.] is one of the most valuable global crops. And vegetable soybean, as a special type of soybean, provides rich nutrition in people's life. In order to investigate the gene expression networks and molecular regulatory mechanisms that regulate soybean seed oil and protein contents during seed development, we performed transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of soybean seeds during development in two soybean varieties that differ in protein and oil contents. We identified a total of 41,036 genes and 392 metabolites, of which 12,712 DEGs and 315 DAMs were identified. Analysis of KEGG enrichment demonstrated that DEGs were primarily enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, glycerolipid metabolism, carbon metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, linoleic acid metabolism, and the biosynthesis of amino acids and secondary metabolites. K-means analysis divided the DEGs into 12 distinct clusters. We identified candidate gene sets that regulate the biosynthesis of protein and oil in soybean seeds, and present potential regulatory patterns that high seed-protein varieties may be more sensitive to desiccation, show earlier photomorphogenesis and delayed leaf senescence, and thus accumulate higher protein contents than high-oil varieties.
