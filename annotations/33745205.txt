Predicted increases in future global temperatures require us to better understand the dimensions of heat stress experienced by plants. Here we highlight four key areas for improving our approach towards understanding plant heat stress responses. First, although the term 'heat stress' is broadly used, that term encompasses heat shock, heat wave and warming experiments, which vary in the duration and magnitude of temperature increase imposed. A greater integration of results and tools across these approaches is needed to better understand how heat stress associated with global warming will affect plants. Secondly, there is a growing need to associate plant responses to tissue temperatures. We review how plant energy budgets determine tissue temperature and discuss the implications of using leaf versus air temperature for heat stress studies. Third, we need to better understand how heat stress affects reproduction, particularly understudied stages such as floral meristem initiation and development. Fourth, we emphasise the need to integrate heat stress recovery into breeding programs to complement recent progress in improving plant heat stress tolerance. Taken together, we provide insights into key research gaps in plant heat stress and provide suggestions on addressing these gaps to enhance heat stress resilience in plants.
