['15864638', 'The Arabidopsis genome encodes for 20 members of putative ligand-gated channels,  termed glutamate receptors (GLR). Despite the fact that initial studies suggested  a role for GLRs in various aspects of photomorphogenesis, calcium homeostasis or  aluminium toxicity, their functional properties and physiological role in plants  remain elusive. Here, we have focussed on AtGLR3.4, which is ubiquitously  expressed in Arabidopsis including roots, vascular bundles, mesophyll cells and  guard cells. AtGLR3.4 encodes a glutamate-, touch-, and cold-sensitive member of  this gene family. Abiotic stress stimuli such as touch, osmotic stress or cold  stimulated AtGLR3.4 expression in an abscisic acid-independent, but  calcium-dependent manner. In plants expressing the Ca(2+) -reporter apoaequorin,  glutamate as well as cold elicited cytosolic calcium elevations. Upon glutamate  treatment of mesophyll cells, the plasma membrane depolarised by about 120 mV.  Both glutamate responses were transient in nature, sensitive to glutamate  receptor antagonists, and were subject to desensitisation. One hour after  eliciting the first calcium signal, a 50% recovery from desensitisation was  observed, reflecting the stimulus-induced fast activation of AtGLR3.4  transcription. We thus conclude that AtGLR3.4 in particular and GLRs in general  could play an important role in the Ca(2+) -based, fast transmission of  environmental stress.', '2005 Oct', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-005-1551-3', 'Becker']
