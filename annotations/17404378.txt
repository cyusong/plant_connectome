Sorbitol, the primary photosynthate and translocated carbohydrate in apple (Malusxdomestica Borkh.), is converted to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH; EC 1.1.1.14) which is active in apple fruit throughout development. In the apple genome, nine SDH genes have been isolated and their sequences characterized, but their individual expression patterns during apple fruit set and development have not been determined. The objective of this work was to ascertain if SDH genes are differentially expressed and how their patterns of expression may relate to SDH activity in apple seed and cortex during early fruit development. Seed SDH activity was found to be much higher than cortex SDH activity per mg and g fresh weight (FW), and seed SDH activity contributed significantly to whole fruit SDH activity during weeks 2-5 after bloom. Five of the nine SDH genes present in the apple genome were expressed in apple fruit. Two SDH genes, SDH1 and SDH3, were expressed in both seed and cortex tissues. SDH2 expression was limited to cortex, while SDH6 and SDH9 were expressed in seed tissues only. SDH isomeric proteins of different pI values were detected in apple fruit. SDH isomers with pI values of 4.2, 4.8, 5.5, and 6.3 were found in seeds, and SDH isomers with pI values of 5.5, 6.3, 7.3, and 8.3 were found in cortex. The present work is the first to show that SDH is highly active in apple seed and that SDH genes are differentially expressed in seed and cortex during early development.
