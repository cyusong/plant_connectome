Although covalent nucleotide modifications were first identified on the bases of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), a number of these epitranscriptome marks have also been found to occur on the bases of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). These covalent mRNA features have been demonstrated to have various and significant effects on the processing (e.g. splicing, polyadenylation, etc.) and functionality (e.g. translation, transport, etc.) of these protein-encoding molecules. Here, we focus our attention on the current understanding of the collection of covalent nucleotide modifications known to occur on mRNAs in plants, how they are detected and studied, and the most outstanding future questions of each of these important epitranscriptomic regulatory signals.
