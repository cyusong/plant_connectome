Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is an important avenue for regeneration of many plants. Although documented over half a century ago, the process of SE remains poorly understood and many factors impact upon competence for SE. We recently reported that a Glycine max ortholog of a MADS-domain transcription factor that promotes SE in Arabidopsis also enhances SE in soybean. We recently assessed transcriptomes in 35Spro:GmAGL15 compared to control during an early time-course of SE and in response to 35Spro:AtAGL15. We expand here upon discussion of the types of genes regulated by overexpression of AGL15 and characterize the step of SE that may be affected by altered accumulation of AGL15.
