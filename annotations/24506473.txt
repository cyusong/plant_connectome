['24506473', "Group II introns are large catalytic RNAs that are found in bacteria and  organellar genomes of lower eukaryotes, but are particularly prevalent within  mitochondria in plants, where they are present in many critical genes. The  excision of plant mitochondrial introns is essential for respiratory functions,  and is facilitated in vivo by various protein cofactors. Typical group II introns  are classified as mobile genetic elements, consisting of the self-splicing  ribozyme and its own intron-encoded maturase protein. A hallmark of maturases is  that they are intron-specific, acting as cofactors that bind their  intron-containing pre-RNAs to facilitate splicing. However, the degeneracy of the  mitochondrial introns in plants and the absence of cognate intron-encoded  maturase open reading frames suggest that their splicing in vivo is assisted by  'trans'-acting protein factors. Interestingly, angiosperms harbor several  nuclear-encoded maturase-related (nMat) genes that contain N-terminal  mitochondrial localization signals. Recently, we established the roles of two of  these paralogs in Arabidopsis, nMAT1 and nMAT2, in the splicing of mitochondrial  introns. Here we show that nMAT4 (At1g74350) is required for RNA processing and  maturation of nad1 introns 1, 3 and 4 in Arabidopsis mitochondria. Seed  germination, seedling establishment and development are strongly affected in  homozygous nmat4 mutants, which also show modified respiration phenotypes that  are tightly associated with complex I defects.", '2014 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12466', 'Ostersetzer-Biran']
