Self-incompatibility (SI) promotes outcrossing, but transitions to self-compatibility (SC) are frequent. Population genetic theory describing the breakdown of SI to SC suggests that, under most conditions, populations should be composed of either SI or SC individuals. Under a narrow range of conditions, theory suggests that SI may persist alongside reduced expression of SI (pseudo-SI, PSI) in mixed-mating populations. We studied genetic variation for PSI segregating in four SI populations of Leavenworthia alabamica by measurement of the heritability of pollen tube number after self-pollination. We tested for the role of the S-locus in this variation by sequencing seven S-alleles from plants with high pseudo-SC (PSC) and testing for the co-segregation of these alleles with PSC. We found a continuous distribution of PSC in all populations and 90% of plants exhibited PSC. The heritability ranged from 0.39 to 0.57. All seven S-alleles from plants with high PSC exhibited trans-specific polymorphism, and no stop codons were observed within the c. 600-bp region sequenced. One of these S-alleles was directly associated with the inheritance of PSC. We conclude that heritable variation in PSC is largely a result of genetic variation in the signaling cascade downstream of the S-locus reaction, together with the presence of one leaky S-allele.
