['10769244', 'In higher plants, meristem organization and cell division regulation are two  fundamentally important and intimately related biological processes. Identifying  and isolating regulatory genes in these processes is essential for understanding  higher plant growth and development. We describe the molecular isolation and  analyses of an Arabidopsis gene, TSO1, which regulates both of these processes.  We previously showed that tso1 mutants displayed defects in cell division of  floral meristem cells including partially formed cell walls, increased DNA  content, and multinucleated cells (Liu, Z., Running, M. P. and Meyerowitz, E. M.  (1997). Development 124, 665-672). Here, we characterize a second defect of tso1  in influorescence meristem development and show that the enlarged influorescence  in tso1 mutants results from repeated division of one inflorescence meristem into  two or more influorescence meristems. Using a map-based approach, we isolated the  TSO1 gene and found that TSO1 encodes a protein with cysteine-rich repeats  bearing similarity to Drosophila Enhancer of zeste and its plant homologs. In  situ TSO1 mRNA expression pattern and the nuclear localization of TSO1-GFP are  consistent with a regulatory role of TSO1 in floral meristem cell division and in  influorescence meristem organization.', '2000 May', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.127.10.2207', 'Liu']
