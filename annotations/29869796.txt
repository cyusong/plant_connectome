Cadmium (Cd) stress is one of the most serious heavy metal stresses limiting plant growth and development. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Cd-induced root growth inhibition remain unclear. Here, we found that ethylene signalling positively regulates Cd-induced root growth inhibition. Arabidopsis seedlings pretreated with the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid exhibited enhanced Cd-induced root growth inhibition, whereas the addition of the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinyl glycine decreased Cd-induced root growth inhibition. Consistently, ethylene-insensitive mutants, such as ein4-1, ein3-1 eil1-1 double mutant, and EBF1ox, displayed an increased tolerance to Cd. Furthermore, we also observed that Cd inhibited EIN3 protein degradation, a process that was regulated by ethylene signalling. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that EIN3 enhanced root growth inhibition under Cd stress through direct binding to the promoters and regulating the expression of XTH33 and LSU1, which encode key regulators of cell wall extension and sulfur metabolic process, respectively. Collectively, our study demonstrates that ethylene plays a positive role in Cd-regulated root growth inhibition through EIN3-mediated transcriptional regulation of XTH33 and LSU1 and provides a molecular framework for the integration of environmental signals and intrinsic regulators in modulating plant root growth.
