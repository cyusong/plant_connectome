Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms. Plants serve as a major entry point for this element into the food chain. Zn deficiency has become a widespread nutritional condition, which mirror the inadequate Zn reserves in significant proportion of the earth's arable land. A recent assessment by the World Health Organization revealed that one third of the world's population is at risk of Zn deficiency. To counter this alarming situation, substantial efforts have been made to increase Zn content and availability in staple crops and grains. Nevertheless, the absence of fundamental information has held back progress in this field. Developing a better understanding of how Zn homeostasis is regulated in plants, such as Zn transporters at loading bottlenecks, is of primary interest to biofortification and phytoremediation programs. Many reviews have been published on this subject, and here we briefly summarize the regulation of one limiting step in Zn distribution within plants - the loading of Zn into root xylem.
