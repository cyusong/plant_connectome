The plant <i>trans</i>-Golgi Network/Early Endosome (TGN/EE), as an organizer of vesicle trafficking, fulfills a crucial role for plant development and adaptation. Because it coordinates the transport of cell material along different routes, it is expected that a number of TGN/EE associated factors function in the rapid organization of post-Golgi trafficking to ensure that proteins reach their destination. The roles of Transport Protein Particle (TRAPP) complexes in the regulation of plant post-Golgi trafficking start to emerge. We previously demonstrated that the plant TRAPPIII complex is involved in maintenance of TGN organization and function and has a role in endocytic trafficking mediated by the SYP61 TGN/EE compartment. Here we show that <i>attrappc11</i> mutants display accumulation of the plasma membrane resident proteins CESA6, BRI1 and PIP1;4 in aberrant intracellular compartments. This adds further insights into the functions of TRAPPIII as a regulators of post-Golgi/endosomal traffic.

TRAPPIII: !regulates! post-Golgi/endosomal traffic
TRAPPIII: !maintains! TGN organization and function
attrappc11: !accumulates! CESA6, BRI1 and PIP1;4
