Peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) is a compound formed by reaction of superoxide (O(2) (-)) with nitric oxide (NO) and is expected to possess characteristics of both O(2) (-) reactivity and NO mobility in order to function as a signal molecule. Although there are several reports that describe the role of ONOO(-) in defense responses in plants, it has been very difficult to detect ONOO(-) in bioimaging due to its short half-life or paucity of methods for ONOO(-)-specific detection among reactive oxygen species or free radicals. Aminophenyl fluorescein (APF), a recently developed novel fluorophore for direct detection of ONOO(-) in bioimaging, was used for intracellular ONOO(-) detection. ONOO(-) generation in tobacco BY-2 cells treated with INF1, the major elicitin secreted by the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans, occurred within 1 h and reached a maximum level at 6-12 h after INF1 treatment. Urate, a ONOO(-) scavenger, abolished INF1-induced ONOO(-) generation. It is well known that ONOO(-) reacts with tyrosine residues in proteins to form nitrotyrosine in a nitration reaction as an ONOO(-)-specific reaction. Western blot analysis using anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies recognized nitrotyrosine-containing proteins in 20 and 50 kDa bands in BY-2 protein extract containing SIN-1 [3-(4-morpholinyl) sydnonimine hydrochloride; an ONOO(-) donor]. These bands were also recognized in INF1-treated BY-2 cells and were found to be slightly suppressed by urate. Our study is the first to report ONOO(-) detection and tyrosine nitration in defense responses in plants.
