['25336567', 'Nexine is a conserved layer of the pollen wall. We previously reported that the  nexine layer is absent in the knockout mutant of TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENT SILENCING  VIA AT-HOOK (TEK). In this work, we characterized the molecular function of TEK  in pollen development and identified direct targets of TEK, Arabinogalactan  proteins (AGPs), which are responsible for nexine formation. Electrophoretic  mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that TEK can directly bind to the nuclear  matrix attachment region (MAR). Phenotypic similarity between tek and the  TEK-SRDX transgenic lines indicated that TEK plays a role in transcriptional  activation in anther development. Microarray analysis identified a total of 661  genes downstream of TEK, including four genes encoding AGPs, AGP6, AGP11, AGP23  and AGP40. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by PCR analysis using  the FLAG-tagged TEK complement lines suggested that TEK is enriched in the  promoters of these four genes. EMSA further confirmed that TEK binds to the AGP6  promoter. The expression of AGP6 driven by the TEK promoter in tek can partially  rescue both nexine formation and plant fertility. These results show that TEK  directly regulates AGPs expression in the anther. It is proposed that  glycoproteins are an essential component of the nexine layer in the pollen wall.', '2014 Oct 20', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssu114', 'Yang']
