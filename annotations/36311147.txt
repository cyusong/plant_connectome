The dynamics and correlations of chlorophyll and phytol content with silage bacterial of different growth heights <i>Pennisetum sinese</i> were investigated. The results demonstrated that the chlorophyll and phytol content of <i>P. sinese</i> before and after ensiled decreased with the increase of growth height. Ensiling significantly reduced pigment content but had no significant effect on phytol. In addition, <i>P. sinese</i> pigment yield before and after ensiled increased with growth heights increasing, and the yield at 150 or 180 cm was obviously higher. Moreover, the higher silage quality V-Score were at 150 or 180 cm growth heights. Furthermore, the silage microbial diversity were varied by growth heights, and some specific undesirable microorganisms (<i>Acinetobacter</i>, <i>Cellvibrio</i>, <i>Sphingobacterium</i>, etc.) were negatively correlated with pigment and phytol content. Therefore, with comprehensive consideration of pigment, phytol yield, and silage quality, the optimum harvest growth height of <i>P. sinese</i> was 150 cm. Furthermore, precise reduction of particular undesirable microorganisms maybe helps to preserve pigments and phytol.
