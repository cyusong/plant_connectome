When photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation is limited and the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> intake to transpiration becomes suboptimal, guard cells, sensing the rise in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the substomatal cavity, deflate and the stomata close. Screens for mutants that do not close in response to experimentally imposed high CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres identified the guard cell-expressed Slowly activating anion channel, SLAC1, as the key player in the regulation of stomatal closure. SLAC1 evolved, though, before the emergence of guard cells. In Arabidopsis, SLAC1 is the founder member of a family of anion channels, which comprises four homologues. SLAC1 and SLAH3 mediate chloride and nitrate transport in guard cells, while SLAH1, SLAH2 and SLAH3 are engaged in root nitrate and chloride acquisition, and anion translocation to the shoot. The signal transduction pathways involved in CO<sub>2</sub> , water stress and nutrient-sensing activate SLAC/SLAH via distinct protein kinase/phosphatase pairs. In this review, we discuss the role that SLAC/SLAH channels play in guard cell closure, on the one hand, and in the root-shoot continuum on the other, along with the molecular basis of the channels' anion selectivity and gating.
