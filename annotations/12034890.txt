['12034890', 'Plant growth and development depends on the activity of a continuously  replenished pool of stem cells within the shoot apical meristem to supply cells  for organogenesis. In Arabidopsis, the stem cell-specific protein CLAVATA3 (CLV3)  acts cell nonautonomously to restrict the size of the stem cell population, but  the hypothesis that CLV3 acts as an extracellular signaling molecule has not been  tested. We used genetic and immunological assays to show that CLV3 localizes to  the apoplast and that export to the extracellular space is required for its  function in activating the CLV1/CLV2 receptor complex. Apoplastic localization  allows CLV3 to signal from the stem cell population to the organizing center in  the underlying cells.', '2002 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.002196', 'Fletcher']
