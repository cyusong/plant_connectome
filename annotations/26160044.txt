['26160044', "BACKGROUND: The actin cytoskeleton is involved in an array of integral structural  and developmental processes throughout the cell. One of actin's best-studied  binding partners is the small ubiquitously expressed protein, profilin.  Arabidopsis thaliana is known to encode a family of five profilin sequence  variants: three vegetative (also constitutive) profilins that are predominantly  expressed in all vegetative tissues and ovules, and two reproductive profilins  that are specifically expressed in pollen. This paper analyzes the roles of the  three vegetative profilin members, PRF1, PRF2, and PRF3, in plant cell and organ  development. RESULTS: Using a collection of knockout or severe knockdown T-DNA  single mutants, we found that defects in each of the three variants gave rise to  specific developmental deficiencies. Plants lacking PRF1 or PRF2 had defects in  rosette leaf morphology and inflorescence stature, while those lacking PRF3 led  to plants with slightly elongated petioles. To further examine these effects,  double mutants and double and triple gene-silenced RNAi epialleles were created.  These plants displayed significantly compounded developmental defects, as well as  distinct lateral root growth morphological phenotypes. CONCLUSION: These results  suggest that having at least one vegetative profilin gene is essential to  viability. Evidence is presented that combinations of independent function,  quantitative genetic effects, and functional redundancy have preserved the three  vegetative profilin genes in the Arabidopsis lineage.", '2015 Jul 11', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/s12870-015-0551-0', 'Meagher']
