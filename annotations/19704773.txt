In non-graminaceous monocots and dicots, phenolic compounds are frequently reported to be the main components of root exudates in response to Fe deficiency. We show that the phenolics secretion is an important part of a plant's adaptive strategy to Fe deficiency stress that encourages a reutilization of the considerable amounts of Fe normally stored and unavailable in the root apoplast. Besides, we also found that the secreted phenolics can selectively alter the soil microbial community, and the altered soil microbial community may in turn favor plant Fe acquisition by producing siderophores and auxins.

Fe deficiency: !encourages! reutilization of Fe
Phenolics secretion: !alters! soil microbial community
Soil microbial community: !favors! plant Fe acquisition
