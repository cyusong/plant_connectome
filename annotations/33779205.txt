LuxR-type transcriptional regulators are essential for many physiological processes in bacteria, including pathogenesis. <i>Acidovorax citrulli</i> is a seedborne bacterial pathogen responsible for bacterial fruit blotch, which causes great losses in melon and watermelon worldwide. However, the LuxR-type transcriptional factors in <i>A. citrulli</i> have not been well studied, except for the previously reported LuxR-type regulatory protein, AcrR, involved in regulating virulence and motility. Here, we characterized a second LuxR-type regulator, AclR, in the group II strain Aac-5 of <i>A. citrulli</i> by mutagenesis, virulence and motility assays, and transcriptomic analysis. Deletion of <i>aclR</i> resulted in impaired twitching and swimming motility and flagellar formation and diminished virulence but increased biofilm formation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 1,379 genes were differentially expressed in the <i>aclR</i> mutant strain, including 29 genes involved in flagellar assembly and 3 involved in pili formation, suggesting a regulatory role for AclR in multiple important biological functions of <i>A. citrulli</i>. Together, our results not only indicate that AclR plays a global role in transcriptional regulation in <i>A. citrulli</i> influencing motility, biofilm formation, and virulence but also provide perspective regarding the regulatory network of biological functions in <i>A. citrulli</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
