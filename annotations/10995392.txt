['10995392', 'The very late-flowering behavior of Arabidopsis winter-annual ecotypes is  conferred mainly by two genes, FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). A  MADS-domain gene, AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (AGL20), was identified as a dominant FRI  suppressor in activation tagging mutagenesis. Overexpression of AGL20 suppresses  not only the late flowering of plants that have functional FRI and FLC alleles  but also the delayed phase transitions during the vegetative stages of plant  development. Interestingly, AGL20 expression is positively regulated not only by  the redundant vernalization and autonomous pathways of flowering but also by the  photoperiod pathway. Our results indicate that AGL20 is an important integrator  of three pathways controlling flowering in Arabidopsis.', '2000 Sep 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.813600', 'Lee']
