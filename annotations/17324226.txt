['17324226', "Leaves are reported to contain a secreted alpha-amylase that accumulates during  senescence or after biotic or abiotic stress; however, a gene encoding this  enzyme has not been described. Because a secreted amylase is isolated from  plastidic starch, the function of this enzyme is difficult to predict, but  circumstantial evidence suggests that it may degrade starch after cell death. The  Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains three alpha-amylase genes, one of which,  AMY1 (At4g25000), has a putative signal sequence suggesting that the protein may  be secreted. Two independent T-DNA insertion mutants in AMY1 lacked an amylase  band on starch zymograms, which was previously named 'A1'. Washed leaf  protoplasts contained reduced A1 activity suggesting that the enzyme is secreted.  Native AMY1, fused to a weakly fluorescent form of GFP, was sensitive to  proteinase K infiltrated into leaf apoplastic spaces, while a cytosolic form of  GFP was unaffected until cell breakage, confirming that the AMY1 protein is  secreted. Amylase A1 was transcriptionally induced in senescing leaves and in  leaves exposed to heat stress, treated with abscisic acid or infected with  Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato expressing avrRpm1. The A1 amylase was also  extremely heat resistant and its expression was up-regulated in cpr5-2, an  activated defence response mutant.", '2007 Apr', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01624.x', 'Monroe']
