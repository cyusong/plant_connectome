The inducible carbon concentration mechanism (CCM) in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been well defined from a molecular and ultrastructural perspective. Inorganic carbon transport proteins, and strategically located carbonic anhydrases deliver CO2 within the chloroplast pyrenoid matrix where Rubisco is packaged. However, there is little understanding of the fundamental signalling and sensing processes leading to CCM induction. While external CO2 limitation has been believed to be the primary cue, the coupling between energetic supply and inorganic carbon demand through regulatory feedback from light harvesting and photorespiration signals could provide the original CCM trigger. Key questions regarding the integration of these processes are addressed in this review. We consider how the chloroplast functions as a crucible for photosynthesis, importing and integrating nuclear-encoded components from the cytoplasm, and sending retrograde signals to the nucleus to regulate CCM induction. We hypothesize that induction of the CCM is associated with retrograde signals associated with photorespiration and/or light stress. We have also examined the significance of common evolutionary pressures for origins of two co-regulated processes, namely the CCM and photorespiration, in addition to identifying genes of interest involved in transcription, protein folding, and regulatory processes which are needed to fully understand the processes leading to CCM induction.
