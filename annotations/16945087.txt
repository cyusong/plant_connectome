Recent years have seen fascinating contributions to our understanding of the molecular dialogue between fungi and plants entering into arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses. Attention has shifted from descriptions of physiological and cellular events to molecular genetics and modern chemical diagnostics. Genes, signal transduction pathways and the chemical structures of components relevant to the symbiosis have been defined. This review examines our current knowledge of signals and mechanisms involved in the establishment of AM symbioses.
