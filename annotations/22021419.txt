['22021419', 'DNA-binding protein phosphatases (DBPs) have been identified as a novel class of  plant-specific regulatory factors playing a role in plant-virus interactions.  NtDBP1 from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) was shown to participate in  transcriptional regulation of gene expression in response to virus infection in  compatible interactions, and AtDBP1, its closest relative in the model plant  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), has recently been found to mediate  susceptibility to potyvirus, one of the most speciose taxa of plant viruses.  Here, we report on the identification of a novel family of highly conserved small  polypeptides that interact with DBP1 proteins both in tobacco and Arabidopsis,  which we have designated DBP-interacting protein 2 (DIP2). The interaction of  AtDIP2 with AtDBP1 was demonstrated in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence  complementation, and AtDIP2 was shown to functionally interfere with AtDBP1 in  yeast. Furthermore, reducing AtDIP2 gene expression leads to increased  susceptibility to the potyvirus Plum pox virus and to a lesser extent also to  Turnip mosaic virus, whereas overexpression results in enhanced resistance.  Therefore, we describe a novel family of conserved small polypeptides in plants  and identify AtDIP2 as a novel host factor contributing to resistance to  potyvirus in Arabidopsis.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.188953', 'Vera']
