['19719484', 'We investigated the physiological and molecular basis of lower fecundity of  massugu2 (msg2), which is a dominant mutant of an auxin primary response gene,  IAA19, in Arabidopsis thaliana. By measuring the length of all stamens and  pistils in inflorescences and the reference growth rate of pistils, we  constructed growth curves of pistils and stamens between stages 12 and 15 of  flower development. Pistil growth was found to consist of a single exponential  growth, while stamen growth consisted of three exponential phases. During the  second exponential phase, the growth rate of stamen filaments was approximately  10 times greater than the growth rates in the other two phases. Consequently,  stamens whose growth was initially retarded grew longer than the pistil, putting  pollen grains on the stigma. msg2-1 stamens, on the other hand, exhibited a less  obvious growth increase, resulting in less frequent contact between anthers and  stigma. MSG2 was expressed in the stamen filaments and its expression almost  coincided with the second growth phase. Stamen filaments appeared to elongate by  cell elongation rather than cell division in the epidermal cell file. Considering  that MSG2 is likely to be a direct target of the auxin F-box receptors, MSG2 may  be one of the master genes that control the transient growth increase of stamen  filaments.', '2009 Oct', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/j.1399-3054.2009.01271.x', 'Yamamoto']
