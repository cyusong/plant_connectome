The two most common styles to analyze genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) and estimate genotypes are additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype + genotype × environment (GGE) biplot. Therefore, the aim of this study was to find the winning genotype(s) under three locations, as well as to investigate the nature and extent of GEI effects on Bambara groundnut production. The experiment was carried out in the fields of three environments with 15 Bambara groundnut accessions using the randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications each in Ibadan, Osun, and Odeda. Yield per plant, fresh seed weight, total number of pods per plant, hundred seed weight, length of seeds, and width of seeds were estimated. According to the combined analysis of variance over environments, genotypes and GEI both had a significant (p < 0.001) impact on Bambara groundnut (BGN) yield. This result revealed that BGN accessions performed differently in the three locations. A two-dimensional GGE biplot was generated using the first two principal component analyses for the pattern of the interaction components with the genotype and GEI. The first two principal component analyses (PCAs) for yield per plant accounted for 59.9% in PCA1 and 40.1% in PCA2. The genotypes that performed best in each environment based on the "which-won-where" polygon were G8, G3, G2, G11, G6, and G4. They were also the vertex genotypes for each environment. Based on the ranking of genotypes, the ideal genotypes were G2 and G6 for YPP, G1 and G5 for FPW, G15 and G13 for TNPP, G3 and GG7 for HSW, G7 and G12 for LOS, and G10 and G7 for WOS. G8 was recorded as the top most-yielding genotype. G8, G4, G7, and G13 were high yielding and the most stable across the environments; G11, G14, and G9 were unstable, but they yielded above-average performance; G14, G12, G15, and G1 were unstable and yielded poorly, as their performances were below average. Bowen was the most discriminating and representative environment and is classified as the superior environment. Based on the performance of accessions in each region, we recommend TVSU 455 (G8) and TVSU 458 (G3) in Bowen, TVSU 455 (G8) and TVSU 939 (G6) and TVSU 454 (G1) in Ibadan, and TVSU 158 (G2) and TVSU 2096 (G10) in Odeda. The variety that performed best in the three environments was TVSU 455 (G8). They could also be used as parental lines in breeding programs.
