Although the primary sequence of kinases shows substantial divergence between unrelated eukaryotes, variation in the motifs that are actually phosphorylated by eukaryotic kinases is much smaller. Hence arrays developed for kinome profiling of mammalian cells are useful for kinome profiling of plant tissues as well, facilitating the study of plant signal transduction. We recently employed the Pepscan kinomics chip to reveal the small GTPases in plant sucrose signaling. Here we show that employing a different peptide library (the Pepscan kinase chip) largely similar results are obtained, confirming these earlier data, but such a different library also contributes new insights into the molecular details mediating plant cell responses to a sugar stimulus. Thus when studying plant signal transduction employing peptide arrays, using multiple platforms both increases the confidence of results and provides additional information.
