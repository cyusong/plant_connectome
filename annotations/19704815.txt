Plants are acutely sensitive to the directional information provided by gravity. They have evolved statocytes, which are specialized cells that sense gravity and, upon integration of the corresponding information with that of other environmental stimuli, control the growth behavior of their organs. The cellular mechanisms that allow statocytes to sense and transduce gravitational information likely involve detecting the sedimentation of, or the tension/pressure exerted by, starch-filled amyloplasts-the presumptive statoliths-within their cytoplasm. Gravity signaling in root statocytes controls the direction of transport of signaling compounds, especially auxin, across the root cap, establishing a lateral gradient that is transmitted to cells in the elongation zone and results in gravitropic curvature. The Arabidopsis J-domain proteins ARG1 and ARL2 function as gravity-signal transducers in root statocytes. In the January issue of The Plant Journal, we reported that ARG1 and ARL2 function non-redundantly in a common gravity signaling pathway required for accumulation of the auxin efflux facilitator PIN3 on the new bottom side of statocytes following gravity stimulation, and lateral redistribution of auxin toward the new lower flank of stimulated roots. Here we present data suggesting that ARG1 physically associates with ARL2, the J-domain co-chaperone HSC70, and actin in vivo. We briefly discuss potential mechanisms by which ARG1 and ARL2 might function in gravity signaling in light of this information.
