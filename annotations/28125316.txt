Tic56 is an essential subunit of a 1-MDa protein complex at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane that comprises Tic100, Tic214 and the protein conducting channel protein Tic20-I. The complex was characterized as the "general protein import translocase" because mutants in either of its subunits have a severe growth phenotype and fail to assemble a photosynthetic machinery. In a recent publication we show that the albino phenotype of tic56-1 mutants results at least in part from a defect in ribosome assembly and a deficiency in plastid translation. We furthermore could not detect any impairment of protein import activity with plastids from tic56-3 mutants, despite a lack of full-length Tic56 and a decreased abundance of other 1-MDa complex subunits. These findings suggest that the 1-MDa complex consists of subunits that have functions other than protein import.
