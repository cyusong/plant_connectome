['10325430', 'The multiprotein complexes involved in active dis-ruption of chromatin structure,  homologous to yeast SWI/SNF complex, have been described for human and Drosophila  cells. In all SWI/SNF-class complexes characterised so far, one of the key  components is the SNF5-type protein. Here we describe the isolation of a plant  (Arabidopsis thaliana ) cDNA encoding a 27 kDa protein which we named BSH, with  high homology to yeast SNF5p and its human (INI1) and Drosophila (SNR1)  counterparts as well as to other putative SNF5-type proteins from Caenorhabditis  elegans, fish and yeast. With 240 amino acids, the Arabidopsis BSH is the  smallest SNF5-type protein so far identified. When expressed in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae, the gene for BSH partially complements the snf5 mutation. BSH is,  however, unable to activate transcription in yeast when tethered to DNA. The gene  for BSH occurs in single copy in the Arabidopsis genome and is ubiquitously  expressed in the plant. Analysis of the whole cell and nuclear protein extracts  with antibodies against recombinant BSH indicates that the protein is localised  in nuclei. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with markedly decreased physiological  level of the BSH mRNA, resulting from the expression of antisense messenger, are  viable but exhibit a distinctive phenotype characterised by bushy growth and  flowers that are unable to produce seeds.', '1999 Jun 1', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/27.11.2393', 'Jerzmanowski']
