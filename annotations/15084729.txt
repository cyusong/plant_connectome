['15084729', 'The transformation of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate, catalyzed by  4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), plays an important role in degrading  aromatic amino acids. As the reaction product homogentisate serves as aromatic  precursor for prenylquinone synthesis in plants, the enzyme is an interesting  target for herbicides. In this study we report the first x-ray structures of the  plant HPPDs of Zea mays and Arabidopsis in their substrate-free form at 2.0 A and  3.0 A resolution, respectively. Previous biochemical characterizations have  demonstrated that eukaryotic enzymes behave as homodimers in contrast to  prokaryotic HPPDs, which are homotetramers. Plant and bacterial enzymes share the  overall fold but use orthogonal surfaces for oligomerization. In addition,  comparison of both structures provides direct evidence that the C-terminal helix  gates substrate access to the active site around a nonheme ferrous iron center.  In the Z. mays HPPD structure this helix packs into the active site, sequestering  it completely from the solvent. In contrast, in the Arabidopsis structure this  helix tilted by about 60 degrees into the solvent and leaves the active site  fully accessible. By elucidating the structure of plant HPPD enzymes we aim to  provide a structural basis for the development of new herbicides.', '2004 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.034082', 'Steinbacher']
