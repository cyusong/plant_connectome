Pollen tube polar growth is a key physiological activity for angiosperms to complete double fertilization, which is highly dependent on the transport of polar substances mediated by secretory vesicles. The exocyst and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins are involved in the regulation of the tethering and fusion of vesicles and plasma membranes, but the molecular mechanism by which they regulate pollen tube polar growth is still unclear. In this study, we found that loss of function of SEC1A, a member of the SM protein family in Arabidopsis thaliana, resulted in reducing pollen tube growth and a significant increase in pollen tube width. SEC1A was diffusely distributed in the pollen tube cytoplasm, and was more concentrated at the tip of the pollen tube. Through co-immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry screening, protein interaction analysis and in vivo microscopy, we found that SEC1A interacted with the exocyst subunit SEC6, and they mutually affected the distribution and secretion rate at the tip of the pollen tube. Meanwhile, the functional loss of SEC1A and SEC6 significantly affected the distribution of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex member SYP125 at the tip of the pollen tube, and led to the disorder of pollen tube cell wall components. Genetic analysis revealed that the pollen tube-related phenotype of the sec1a sec6 double mutant was significantly enhanced compared with their respective single mutants. Therefore, we speculated that SEC1A and SEC6 cooperatively regulate the fusion of secretory vesicles and plasma membranes in pollen tubes, thereby affecting the length and the width of pollen tubes.
