['19326079', 'Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) are reported to be porin-type,  beta-barrel diffusion pores. They are prominently localized in the outer  mitochondrial membrane and are involved in metabolite exchange between the  organelle and the cytosol. In this study, we have investigated a family of VDAC  isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtVDAC). We have shown that the heterologous  expression of AtVDAC proteins can functionally complement a yeast mutant lacking  the endogenous mitochondrial VDAC gene. AtVDACs tagged with GFP were localized to  mitochondria in both yeast and plant cells. We also looked at the response of  AtVDACs to biotic and abiotic stresses and found that four AtVDAC transcripts  were rapidly up-regulated in response to a bacterial pathogen.', '2009 Mar 31', 'Mol Cells', '10.1007/s10059-009-0041-z', 'Chung']
