C<sub>4</sub> plants achieve higher photosynthesis (A<sub>n</sub> ) and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) than C<sub>3</sub> plants, but processes underpinning the variability in A<sub>n</sub> and iWUE across the three C<sub>4</sub> subtypes remain unclear, partly because we lack an integrated framework for quantifying the contribution of diffusional and biochemical limitations to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We exploited the natural diversity among C<sub>4</sub> grasses to develop an original mathematical approach for estimating eight key processes of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis and their relative limitations to A<sub>n</sub> . We also developed a new formulation to estimate mesophyll conductance (g<sub>m</sub> ) based on actual hydration rates of CO<sub>2</sub> by carbonic anhydrases. We found a positive relationship between g<sub>m</sub> and iWUE and an inverse correlation with g<sub>sw</sub> among C<sub>4</sub> grasses. We also revealed subtype-specific regulatory processes of iWUE that may be related to known anatomical traits characterising each C<sub>4</sub> subtype. Leaf width was an important determinant of iWUE and showed significant correlations with key limitations of A<sub>n</sub> , especially among NADP-ME species. In conclusion, incorporating leaf width in breeding trials may unlock new opportunities for C<sub>4</sub> crops because the revealed negative relationship between leaf width and iWUE may translate into higher crop and canopy WUE.
