In the post-genomic sequencing era, an expanding portfolio of genomic technologies has been applied to the study of gene function. Reverse genetics approaches that provide targeted inactivation of genes identified by sequence analysis include TILLING (for Targeting Local Lesions IN Genomes). TILLING searches the genomes of mutagenized organisms for mutations in a chosen gene, typically single base-pair substitutions. This review covers practical aspects of the technology, ranging from building the mutagenized population to mutation discovery, and discusses possible improvements to current protocols and the impact of new genomic methods for mutation discovery in relation to the future of the TILLING approach.
