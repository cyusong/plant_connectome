['25619813', 'Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins affect processes of growth and  development by changing transcription and reading epigenetic histone  modifications, but their functions in abiotic stress responses remain largely  unclear. Here we characterized seven Arabidopsis thaliana Alfin1-like PHD finger  proteins (ALs) in terms of the responses to abiotic stresses. ALs localized to  the nucleus and repressed transcription. Except AL6, all the ALs bound to G-rich  elements. Mutations of the amino acids at positions 34 and 35 in AL6 caused loss  of ability to bind to G-rich elements. Expression of the AL genes responded  differentially to osmotic stress, salt, cold and abscisic acid treatments.  AL5-over-expressing plants showed higher tolerance to salt, drought and freezing  stress than Col-0. Consistently, al5 mutants showed reduced stress tolerance. We  used ChIP-Seq assays to identify eight direct targets of AL5, and found that AL5  binds to the promoter regions of these genes. Knockout mutants of five of these  target genes exhibited varying tolerances to stresses. These results indicate  that AL5 inhibits multiple signaling pathways to confer stress tolerance. Our  study sheds light on mechanisms of AL5-mediated signaling in abiotic stress  responses, and provides tools for improvement of stress tolerance in crop plants.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12773', 'Chen']
