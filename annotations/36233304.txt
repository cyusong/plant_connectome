There is an array of pathogenic fungi in the natural environment of plants, which produce some molecules including pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and effectors during infection. These molecules, which can be recognized by plant specific receptors to activate plant immunity, including PTI (PAMP-triggered immunity) and ETI (effector-triggered immunity), are called elicitors. Undoubtedly, identification of novel fungal elicitors and their plant receptors and comprehensive understanding about fungal elicitor-triggered plant immunity will be of great significance to effectively control plant diseases. Great progress has occurred in fungal elicitor-triggered plant immunity, especially in the signaling pathways of PTI and ETI, in recent years. Here, recent advances in fungal elicitor-triggered plant immunity are summarized and their important contribution to the enlightenment of plant disease control is also discussed.
