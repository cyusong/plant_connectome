Improving crop yield potential through an enhanced response to rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels is an effective strategy for sustainable crop production in the face of climate change. Large-sized panicles (containing many spikelets per panicle) have been a recent ideal plant architecture (IPA) for high-yield rice breeding. However, few breeding programs have proposed an IPA under the projected climate change. Here, we demonstrate through the cloning of the rice (Oryza sativa) quantitative trait locus for MORE PANICLES 3 (MP3) that the improvement in panicle number increases grain yield at elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. MP3 is a natural allele of OsTB1/FC1, previously reported as a negative regulator of tiller bud outgrowth. The temperate japonica allele advanced the developmental process in axillary buds, moderately promoted tillering, and increased the panicle number without negative effects on the panicle size or culm thickness in a high-yielding indica cultivar with large-sized panicles. The MP3 allele, containing three exonic polymorphisms, was observed in most accessions in the temperate japonica subgroups but was rarely observed in the indica subgroup. No selective sweep at MP3 in either the temperate japonica or indica subgroups suggested that MP3 has not been involved and utilized in artificial selection during domestication or breeding. A free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiment revealed a clear increase of grain yield associated with the temperate japonica allele at elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Our findings show that the moderately increased panicle number combined with large-sized panicles using MP3 could be a novel IPA and contribute to an increase in rice production under climate change with rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels.
