In plant science, 2,4-dinitrophenylether of iodonitrothymol (DNP-INT) is frequently used as an alternative to 2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBMIB) to examine the capacity of plastoquinol and semiquinone to reduce O<sub>2</sub>. DNP-INT is considered to be an effective inhibitor of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain (PETC) through its binding at the Q<sub>0</sub> site of Cyt-<i>b6f</i>. The binding and action of DNP-INT has been previously characterized spectroscopically in purified Cyt-<i>b6f</i> complex reconstituted with Plastocyanin, PSII membranes and plastoquinone, as well as in isolated thylakoids based on its property to block MV-mediated O<sub>2</sub> consumption. Contrary to the conclusions obtained from these experiments, we observed clear reduction of P700<sup>+</sup> in samples incubated with DNP-INT during our recent investigation into the sites of oxygen consumption in isolated thylakoids. Therefore, we carried out an extensive investigation of DNP-INT's chemical efficacy in isolated thylakoids and intact leaves. This included examination of its capacity to block the PETC before PSI, and therefore its inhibition of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. P700 redox kinetics were measured using Dual-PAM whilst Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) was used for simultaneous determination of the rates of O<sub>2</sub> evolution and O<sub>2</sub> consumption in isolated thylakoids and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in intact leaves, using two stable isotopes of oxygen (<sup>16</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, <sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) and CO<sub>2</sub> (<sup>12</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>C), respectively. Based on these investigations we confirmed that DNP-INT is unable to completely block the PETC and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, therefore its use may produce artifacts if applied to isolated thylakoids or intact cells, especially when determining the locations of reactive oxygen species formation in the photosynthetic apparatus.
