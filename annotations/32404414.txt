Since their origin in the early Cretaceous, grasses have diversified across every continent on Earth, with a handful of species (rice [<i>Oryza sativa</i>], maize [<i>Zea mays</i>], and wheat [<i>Triticum aestivum</i>]) providing most of the caloric intake of contemporary humans and their livestock. The ecological dominance of grasses can be attributed to a number of physiological innovations, many of which contributed to shifts from closed to open habitats that incur daily (e.g. tropical mountains) and/or seasonal extremes in temperature (e.g. temperate/continental regions) and precipitation (e.g. tropical savannas). In addition to strategies that allow them to tolerate or resist periodically stressful environments, plants can adopt escape behaviors by modifying the relative timing of distinct development phases. Flowering time is one of these behaviors that can also act as a postzygotic barrier to reproduction and allow temporal partitioning of resources to promote coexistence. In this review, we explore what is known about the phylogenetic pattern of flowering control in grasses, and how this relates to broad- and fine-scale niche transitions within the family. We then synthesize recent findings on the genetic basis of flowering time evolution as a way to begin deciphering why certain aspects of flowering are seemingly so conserved, and what the implications of this are for future adaptation under climate change.
