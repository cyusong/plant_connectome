['11522909', 'In order to clarify the peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs), we characterized  one of the major PMPs, PMP38. The deduced amino acid sequence for its cDNA in  Arabidopsis thaliana contained polypeptides with 331 amino acids and had high  similarity with those of Homo sapiens PMP34 and Candida boidinii PMP47 known as  homologues of mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier protein. We expected PMP38 to be  localized on peroxisomal membranes, because it had the membrane peroxisomal  targeting signal. Cell fractionation and immunocytochemical analysis using  pumpkin cotyledons revealed that PMP38 is localized on peroxisomal membranes as  an integral membrane protein. The amount of PMP38 in pumpkin cotyledons increased  and reached the maximum protein level after 6 d in the dark but decreased  thereafter. Illumination of the seedlings caused a significant decrease in the  amount of the protein. These results clearly showed that the membrane protein  PMP38 in glyoxysomes changes dramatically during the transformation of  glyoxysomes to leaf peroxisomes, as do the other glyoxysomal enzymes, especially  enzymes of the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle, that are localized in the matrix  of glyoxysomes.', '2001 Aug', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pce108', 'Nishimura']
