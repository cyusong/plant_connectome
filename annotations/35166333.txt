The unique morphology of grass stomata enables rapid responses to environmental changes. Deciphering the basis for these responses is critical for improving food security. We have developed a planta platform of single-nucleus RNA-sequencing by combined fluorescence-activated nuclei flow sorting, and used it to identify cell types in mature and developing stomata from 33,098 nuclei of the maize epidermis-enriched tissues. Guard cells (GCs) and subsidiary cells (SCs) displayed differential expression of genes, besides those encoding transporters, involved in the abscisic acid, CO2, Ca2+, starch metabolism, and blue light signaling pathways, implicating coordinated signal integration in speedy stomatal responses, and of genes affecting cell wall plasticity, implying a more sophisticated relationship between GCs and SCs in stomatal development and dumbbell-shaped guard cell formation. The trajectory of stomatal development identified in young tissues, and by comparison to the bulk RNA-seq data of the MUTE defective mutant in stomatal development, confirmed known features, and shed light on key participants in stomatal development. Our study provides a valuable, comprehensive, and fundamental foundation for further insights into grass stomatal function.
