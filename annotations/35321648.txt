Clematis species are attractive ornamental plants with a variety of flower colors and patterns. Heat stress is one of the main factors restricting the growth, development, and ornamental value of Clematis. Clematis lanuginosa and Clematis crassifolia are large-flowered and evergreen Clematis species, respectively, that show different tolerance to heat stress. We compared and analyzed the transcriptome of C. lanuginose and C. crassifolia under heat stress to determine the regulatory mechanism(s) of resistance. A total of 1720 and 6178 differentially expressed genes were identified from C. lanuginose and C. crassifolia, respectively. The photosynthesis and oxidation-reduction processes of C. crassifolia were more sensitive than C. lanuginose under heat stress. Glycine/serine/threonine metabolism, glyoxylic metabolism, and thiamine metabolism were important pathways in response to heat stress in C. lanuginose, and flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and arginine/proline metabolism were the key pathways in C. crassifolia. Six sHSPs (c176964_g1, c200771_g1, c204924_g1, c199407_g2, c201522_g2, c192936_g1), POD1 (c200317_g1), POD3 (c210145_g2), DREB2 (c182557_g1), and HSFA2 (c206233_g2) may be key genes in the response to heat stress in C. lanuginose and C. crassifolia. We compared important metabolic pathways and differentially expressed genes in response to heat stress between C. lanuginose and C. crassifolia. The results increase our understanding of the response mechanism and candidate genes of Clematis under heat stress. These data may contribute to the development of new Clematis varieties with greater heat tolerance.
