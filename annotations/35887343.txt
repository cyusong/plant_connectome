Pollen fertility plays an important role in the application of heterosis in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.). However, the key genes and mechanisms underlying pollen abortion in K-type male sterility remain unclear. <i>TAA1a</i> is an essential gene for pollen development in wheat. Here, we explored the mechanism involved in its transcriptional regulation during pollen development, focusing on a 1315-bp promoter region. Several <i>cis</i>-acting elements were identified in the <i>TAA1a</i> promoter, including binding motifs for <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> AtAMS and AtMYB103 (CANNTG and CCAACC, respectively). Evolutionary analysis indicated that <i>TaTDRL</i> and <i>TaMYB103</i> were the <i>T. aestivum</i> homologs of <i>AtAMS</i> and <i>AtMYB103</i>, respectively, and encoded nucleus-localized transcription factors containing 557 and 352 amino acids, respectively. <i>TaTDRL</i> and <i>TaMYB103</i> were specifically expressed in wheat anthers, and their expression levels were highest in the early uninucleate stage; this expression pattern was consistent with that of <i>TAA1a</i>. Meanwhile, we found that TaTDRL and TaMYB03 directly interacted, as evidenced by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, while yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays revealed that both TaTDRL and TaMYB103 could bind the <i>TAA1a</i> promoter and synergistically increase its transcriptional activity. Furthermore, TaTDRL-EAR and TaMYB103-EAR transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants displayed abnormal microspore morphology, reduced pollen viability, and lowered seed setting rates. Additionally, the expression of <i>AtMS2</i>, a <i>TAA1a</i> homolog, was significantly lower in the two repressor lines than in the corresponding overexpression lines or WT plants. In summary, we identified a potential transcriptional regulatory mechanism associated with wheat pollen development.
