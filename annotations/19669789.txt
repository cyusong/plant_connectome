The auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) has already been proved to be an extracellular receptor of auxin in single cell systems. Protoplasts of maize coleoptiles respond to auxin with an increase in volume. The 2-naphthaleneacetic acid (2-NAA), an inactive auxin analog, acts as an anti-auxin in protoplast swelling, as it suppresses the effect of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Antibodies raised against box a of ABP1 induce protoplast swelling in the absence of auxin. This response is inhibited by pre-incubation with 2-NAA. The effect of 2-NAA on swelling induced by agonistic antibodies appears to depend on the binding characteristics of the antibody. ScFv12, an antibody directed against box a, box c and the C-terminal domain of ABP1 also exhibits auxin-agonist activity which is, however, not abolished by 2-NAA. Neither does 2-NAA affect the activity of the C-terminal peptide of ABP1, which is predicted to interact with putative binding proteins of ABP1. These results support the view that box a and box c of ABP1 are auxin-binding domains.
