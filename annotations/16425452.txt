The effect of heavy metal stress as a potent abiotic elicitor for triggering an accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) was investigated. Copper and cadmium in in vivo conditions induced accumulation of jasmonates in mature leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana and in young and oldest Phaseolus coccineus plants. The dynamics of jasmonate accumulation showed a biphasic character in both plants. In the first phase, after 7 (A. thaliana) or 14h (P. coccineus) of exposure to Cu or Cd, a rapid increase of JA level occurred, followed by a rapid decrease observed during 7 successive hours. In the next phase, a repeated but slow increase of JA content occurred. The heavy metal stress induced in particular a more stable (3R,7R) form of jasmonates. These results indicate that JA is connected with the mechanism of toxic action of both heavy metals in plants, differentially reacting to exogenous JA and possessing variable dynamics depending on the plants studied as well as their growth stage.
