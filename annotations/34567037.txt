During the energy crisis associated with submergence stress, plants restrict mRNA translation and rapidly accumulate stress granules that act as storage hubs for arrested mRNA complexes. One of the proteins associated with hypoxia-induced stress granules in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> is the calcium-sensor protein CALMODULIN-LIKE 38 (CML38). Here, we show that SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3) is a CML38-binding protein, and that SGS3 and CML38 co-localize within hypoxia-induced RNA stress granule-like structures. Hypoxia-induced SGS3 granules are subject to turnover by autophagy, and this requires both CML38 as well as the AAA<sup>+</sup>-ATPase CELL DIVISION CYCLE 48A (CDC48A). CML38 also interacts directly with CDC48A, and CML38 recruits CDC48A to CML38 granules in planta. Together, this work demonstrates that SGS3 associates with stress granule-like structures during hypoxia stress that are subject to degradation by CML38 and CDC48-dependent autophagy. Further, the work identifies direct regulatory targets for the hypoxia calcium-sensor CML38, and suggest that CML38 association with stress granules and associated regulation of autophagy may be part of the RNA regulatory program during hypoxia stress.
