['30210511', 'The Brix domain is a conserved domain in several proteins involved in ribosome  biogenesis in yeast and animals. In the Arabidopsis genome, six Brix  domain-containing proteins are encoded; however, their molecular functions have  not been fully characterized, as yet. Here we report the functional analysis of a  Brix domain-containing protein, ARPF2, which is homologous to yeast Rpf2 that  plays an essential role in ribosome biogenesis as a component of the 5S  ribonucleoprotein particle. By phenotypic characterization of arpf2 mutants,  histochemical GUS staining, and analysis using green fluorescence protein, we  show that ARPF2 is an essential and ubiquitously expressed gene encoding a  nucleolar protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and split-GFP-based bimolecular  fluorescence complementation assays revealed that ARPF2 interacts with a protein  named ARRS1, which is homologous to yeast Rrs1 that forms a complex with Rpf2 in  yeast. Furthermore, the result of RNA immunoprecipitation assay indicated that  ARPF2 interacts with 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or the precursor of 5S rRNA, as well  as with the internal transcribed spacer 2 in the precursors of 25S rRNA. Most  intriguingly, we found that the overexpression of ARPF2 and ARRS1 leads to  characteristic phenotypes, including short stem, abnormal leaf morphology, and  long lifespan, in Arabidopsis. These results suggest that the function of Brix  domain-containing ARPF2 protein in ribosome biogenesis is intimately associated  with the growth and development in plants.', '2018', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2018.01177', 'Yanagisawa']
