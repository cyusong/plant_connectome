Pitaya (<i>Hylocereus polyrhizus</i>) is cultivated in a broad ecological range, due to its tolerance to drought, heat, and poor soil. The zinc finger proteins regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, by interacting with DNA, RNA, and proteins, to play roles in plant growth and development, and stress response. Here, a total of 81 CCCH-type zinc finger protein genes were identified from the pitaya genome. Transcriptomic analysis showed that nine of them, including <i>HuTZF3</i>, responded to both salt and heat stress. RT-qPCR results showed that <i>HuTZF3</i> is expressed in all tested organs of pitaya, with a high level in the roots and stems, and confirmed that expression of <i>HuTZF3</i> is induced by salt and heat stress. Subcellular localization showed that HuTZF3 is targeted in the processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs). Heterologous expression of <i>HuTZF3</i> could improve both salt and heat tolerance in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, reduce oxidative stress, and improve the activity of catalase and peroxidase. Therefore, HuTZF3 may be involved in post-transcriptional regulation via localizing to PBs and SGs, contributing to both salt and heat tolerance in pitaya.
