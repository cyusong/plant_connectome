Accurate and timely nitrogen (N) scheduling requires knowledge of in-season crop N deficit. Therefore, understanding the association between crop growth and crop N demand during its growth period is imperative for fine-tuning N scheduling decisions to actual crop N demand and to enhance N use efficiency. The concept of the critical N dilution curve has been employed to assess and quantify the intensity and time of crop N deficit. However, research regarding the association between crop N deficit and N use efficiency in wheat is limited. The present study was carried out to determine whether there are relationships between the accumulated nitrogen deficit (N<sub>and</sub>) and agronomic N use efficiency (AE<sub>N</sub>) as well as with its components (N fertilizer recovery efficiency (RE<sub>N</sub>) and N fertilizer physiological efficiency (PE<sub>N</sub>)) of winter wheat and to explore the potential capacity of N<sub>and</sub> for predicting AE<sub>N</sub> and its components. Data acquired from five variable N rates (0, 75, 150, 225, and 300 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) field experiments using six winter wheat cultivars were used to establish and validate the relationships between N<sub>and</sub> and AE<sub>N</sub>, RE<sub>N</sub>, and PE<sub>N</sub>. The results indicated that plant N concentration in winter wheat was significantly affected by N application rates. N<sub>and</sub> varied from -65.73 to 104.37 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> after Feekes stage 6 under different N application rates. The AE<sub>N</sub> and its components were also affected by cultivars, N levels, seasons, and growth stages. A positive correlation was observed between N<sub>and</sub>, AE<sub>N</sub>, and its components. Validation using an independent data set showed the robustness of the newly developed empirical models to accurately predict AE<sub>N</sub>, RE<sub>N,</sub> and PE<sub>N</sub> with an RMSE of 3.43 kg kg<sup>-1</sup>, 4.22%, and 3.67 kg kg<sup>-1</sup> and RRMSE of 17.53%, 12.46%, and 13.17%, respectively. This indicates that N<sub>and</sub> has the potential to predict AE<sub>N</sub> and its components during the growth period of winter wheat. The findings will assist in improving in-season N use efficiency by fine-tuning N scheduling decisions in winter wheat cultivation.
