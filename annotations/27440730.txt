In order to contribute to evolutionary resilience and adaptive potential in highly modified landscapes, revegetated areas should ideally reflect levels of genetic diversity within and across natural stands. Landscape genomic analyses enable such diversity patterns to be characterized at genome and chromosomal levels. Landscape-wide patterns of genomic diversity were assessed in Eucalyptus microcarpa, a dominant tree species widely used in revegetation in Southeastern Australia. Trees from small and large patches within large remnants, small isolated remnants and revegetation sites were assessed across the now highly fragmented distribution of this species using the DArTseq genomic approach. Genomic diversity was similar within all three types of remnant patches analysed, although often significantly but only slightly lower in revegetation sites compared with natural remnants. Differences in diversity between stand types varied across chromosomes. Genomic differentiation was higher between small, isolated remnants, and among revegetated sites compared with natural stands. We conclude that small remnants and revegetated sites of our E. microcarpa samples largely but not completely capture patterns in genomic diversity across the landscape. Genomic approaches provide a powerful tool for assessing restoration efforts across the landscape.
