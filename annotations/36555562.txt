The harmful effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been confirmed in many organisms, but the mechanism of their toxicity is not yet fully understood. In biological systems, AgNPs tend to aggregate and dissolve, so they are often stabilized by coatings that influence their physico-chemical properties. In this study, the effects of AgNPs with different coatings [polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)] on oxidative stress appearance and proteome changes in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) seedlings have been examined. To discriminate between the nanoparticulate Ag form from the ionic one, the treatments with AgNO<sub>3</sub>, a source of Ag<sup>+</sup> ions, were also included. Ag uptake and accumulation were found to be similarly effective upon exposure to all treatment types, although positively charged AgNP-CTAB showed less stability and a generally stronger impact on the investigated parameters in comparison with more stable and negatively charged AgNP-PVP and ionic silver (AgNO<sub>3</sub>). Both AgNP treatments induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and increased the expression of proteins involved in antioxidant defense, confirming oxidative stress as an important mechanism of AgNP phytotoxicity. However, the mechanism of seedling responses differed depending on the type of AgNP used. The highest AgNP-CTAB concentration and CTAB coating resulted in increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content and significant damage to lipids, proteins and DNA molecules, as well as a strong activation of antioxidant enzymes, especially CAT and APX. On the other hand, AgNP-PVP and AgNO<sub>3</sub> treatments induced the nonenzymatic antioxidants by significantly increasing the proline and GSH content. Exposure to AgNP-CTAB also resulted in more noticeable changes in the expression of proteins belonging to the defense and stress response, carbohydrate and energy metabolism and storage protein categories in comparison to AgNP-PVP and AgNO<sub>3</sub>. Cysteine addition significantly reduced the effects of AgNP-PVP and AgNO<sub>3</sub> for the majority of investigated parameters, indicating that AgNP-PVP toxicity mostly derives from released Ag<sup>+</sup> ions. AgNP-CTAB effects, however, were not alleviated by cysteine addition, suggesting that their toxicity derives from the intrinsic properties of the nanoparticles and the coating itself.
