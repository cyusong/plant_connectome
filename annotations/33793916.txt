The seeds of flowering plants contain three genetically distinct structures: the embryo, endosperm, and seed coat. The embryo and endosperm need to interact and exchange signals to ensure coordinated growth. Accumulating evidence has confirmed that embryo growth is supported by the nourishing endosperm and regulated by signals originating from the endosperm. Available data also support that endosperm development requires communication with the embryo. Here, using single-fertilization mutants, Arabidopsis thaliana dmp8 dmp9 and gex2, we demonstrate that in the absence of a zygote and embryo, endosperm initiation, syncytium formation, free nuclear cellularization, and endosperm degeneration occur as in the wild type in terms of the cytological process and time course. Although rapid embryo expansion accelerates endosperm breakdown, our findings strongly suggest that endosperm development is an autonomously organized process, independent of egg cell fertilization and embryo-endosperm communication. This work confirms both the altruistic and self-directed nature of the endosperm during coordinated embryo-endosperm development. Our findings provide insights into the intricate interaction between the two fertilization products and will help to distinguish the physiological roles of the signaling between endosperm and embryo. These findings also open new avenues in agro-biotechnology for crop improvement.
