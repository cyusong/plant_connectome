<i>Plukenetia volubilis</i> L. (Malpighiales: Euphorbiaceae), also known as Sacha inchi, is considered a promising crop due to its high seed content of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), all of them highly valuable for food and cosmetic industries, but the genetic basis of oil biosynthesis of this non-model plant is still insufficient. Here, we sequenced the total DNA of Sacha inchi by using Illumina and Nanopore technologies and approached a <i>de novo</i> reconstruction of the whole nucleotide sequence and the organization of its 164,111 bp length of the chloroplast genome, displaying two copies of an inverted repeat sequence [inverted repeat A (IRA) and inverted repeat B (IRB)] of 28,209 bp, each one separating a small single copy (SSC) region of 17,860 bp and a large single copy (LSC) region of 89,833 bp. We detected two large inversions on the chloroplast genome that were not presented in the previously reported sequence and studied a promising cpDNA marker, useful in phylogenetic approaches. This chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) marker was used on a set of five distinct Colombian cultivars of <i>P. volubilis</i> from different geographical locations to reveal their phylogenetic relationships. Thus, we evaluated if it has enough resolution to genotype cultivars, intending to crossbreed parents and following marker's trace down to the F1 generation. We finally elucidated, by using molecular and cytological methods on cut flower buds, that the inheritance mode of <i>P. volubilis</i> cpDNA is maternally transmitted and proposed that it occurs as long as it is physically excluded during pollen development. This <i>de novo</i> chloroplast genome will provide a valuable resource for studying this promising crop, allowing the determination of the organellar inheritance mechanism of some critical phenotypic traits and enabling the use of genetic engineering in breeding programs to develop new varieties.
