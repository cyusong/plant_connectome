['23607329', 'Stem cells in the root and shoot apical meristem provide the descendant cells  required for growth and development throughout the lifecycle of a plant. We found  that mutations in the Arabidopsis MAINTENANCE OF MERISTEMS (MAIN) gene led to  plants with distorted stem cell niches in which stem cells are not maintained and  undergo premature differentiation or cell death. The malfunction of main  meristems leads to short roots, mis-shaped leaves, reduced fertility and partial  fasciation of stems. MAIN encodes a nuclear-localized protein and is a member of  a so far uncharacterized plant-specific gene family. As main mutant plants are  hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents, expression of genes involved in DNA repair  is induced and dead cells with damaged DNA accumulate in the mutant meristems, we  propose that MAIN is required for meristem maintenance by sustaining genome  integrity in stem cells and their descendants cells.', '2013 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12215', 'Sauer']
