['21570971', 'We provide evidence that one of the 11 Arabidopsis actin-depolymerizing factors  (ADFs), namely ADF9, does not display typical F-actin depolymerizing activity.  Instead, ADF9 effectively stabilizes actin filaments in vitro and concomitantly  bundles actin filaments with the highest efficiency under acidic conditions.  Competition experiments show that ADF9 antagonizes ADF1 activity by reducing its  ability to potentiate F-actin depolymerization. Accordingly, ectopic expression  of ADF1 and ADF9 in tobacco cells has opposite effects. ADF1 severs actin  filaments/bundles and promotes actin cytoskeleton disassembly, whereas ADF9  induces the formation of long bundles. Together these data reveal an additional  degree of complexity in the comprehension of the biological functions of the ADF  family and illustrate that antagonist activities can be displayed by seemingly  equivalent actin-binding proteins.', '2011 Jun 23', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2011.05.019', 'Thomas']
