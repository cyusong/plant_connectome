Plants emit complex mixtures of volatile organic compounds from floral and vegetative tissue, especially after herbivore damage, so it is difficult to associate individual compounds with activity towards pollinators, herbivores or herbivore enemies. Attention has usually focused upon the biological activity of the most abundant compounds; but here, we detail a number of reports implicating minor volatiles in attractant or deterrent roles. This is not surprising given the exquisite sensitivity of insect olfactory systems for certain substances. In this context, it is worth reconsidering the methods involved in sampling volatile compounds from plants, measuring their abundance and determining their biological activity to ensure that minor compounds are not overlooked. Here, we describe various experimental approaches and chemical and statistical methods that should increase the chance of detecting minor compounds with major biological activities.
