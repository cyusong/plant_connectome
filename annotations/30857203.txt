APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor superfamily (AP2/ERF) is a transcription factor involved in abiotic stresses, for instance, cold, drought, and low oxygen. In this study, a novel ethylene-responsive transcription factor named <i>AdRAP2.3</i> was isolated from <i>Actinidia</i> <i>deliciosa</i> 'Jinkui'. <i>AdRAP2.3</i> transcription levels in other reproductive organs except for the pistil were higher than those in the vegetative organs (root, stem, and leaf) in kiwi fruit. Plant hormones (Salicylic acid (SA), Methyl-jasmonate acid (MeJA), 1-Aminocyclopropanecarboxylic Acid (ACC), Abscisic acid (ABA)), abiotic stresses (waterlogging, heat, 4 °C and NaCl) and biotic stress (<i>Pseudomonas Syringae</i> pv. <i>Actinidiae</i>, <i>Psa</i>) could induce the expression of <i>AdRAP2.3</i> gene in kiwi fruit. Overexpression of the <i>AdRAP2.3</i> gene conferred waterlogging stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco plants. When completely submerged, the survival rate, fresh weight, and dry weight of transgenic tobacco lines were significantly higher than those of wile type (WT). Upon the roots being submerged, transgenic tobacco lines grew aerial roots earlier. Overexpression of <i>AdRAP2.3</i> in transgenic tobacco improved the pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme activities, and improved the expression levels of waterlogging mark genes <i>NtPDC</i>, <i>NtADH</i>, <i>NtHB1</i>, <i>NtHB2</i>, <i>NtPCO1</i>, and <i>NtPCO2</i> in roots under waterlogging treatment. Overall, these results demonstrated that <i>AdRAP2.3</i> might play an important role in resistance to waterlogging through regulation of <i>PDC</i> and <i>ADH</i> genes in kiwi fruit.
