Increasing the oil content of leafy biomass is emerging as a sustainable source of vegetable oil to meet global demand. Transient gene expression in leaf provides a reproducible platform to study the effect of transgenes on lipid biosynthesis. We first generated a transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana line containing high levels of triacylglycerol in the leaf tissue (31.4% by dry weight) by stably expressing WRI1, DGAT1 and OLEOSIN. We then used this line as a platform to test the effect of three Arabidopsis thaliana thioesterases (FATA1, FATA2 and FATB). Further increases in leaf oil content were observed with biochemical and lipid assays revealing an increase in the export of fatty acids from the chloroplast and a modification in the oil profile.
