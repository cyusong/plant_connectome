In plant protection, the increasing maturity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has greatly increased efficiency. UAVs can adapt to multiple terrains and do not require specific take-off platforms. They do well, especially in farmland areas with rugged terrain. However, due to the complex flow field at the bottom of a UAV, some of the droplets will not reach the surface of a plant, which causes pesticide waste and environmental pollution. Droplet deposition is a good indicator of the utilization rate of pesticides; therefore, this review describes recent studies on droplet deposition for further method improvement. First, this review introduces the flight altitude, speed, and environmental factors that affect pesticide utilization efficiency and then summarizes methods to improve pesticide utilization efficiency from three aspects: nozzles, electrostatic sprays, and variable spray systems. We also point out the possible direction of algorithm development for a UAV's precision spray.
