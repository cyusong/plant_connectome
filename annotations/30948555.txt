Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important hormone for seed development and germination whose physiological action is modulated by its endogenous levels. Cleavage of carotenoid precursors by 9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) and inactivation of ABA by ABA 8'-hydroxylase (CYP707A) are key regulatory metabolic steps. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), both enzymes are encoded by multigene families, having distinctive expression patterns. To evaluate the genome-wide impact of ABA deficiency in developing seeds at the maturation stage when dormancy is induced, we used a <i>nced2569</i> quadruple mutant in which ABA deficiency is mostly restricted to seeds, thus limiting the impact of maternal defects on seed physiology. ABA content was very low in <i>nced2569</i> seeds, similar to the severe mutant <i>aba2</i>; unexpectedly, ABA Glc ester was detected in <i>aba2</i> seeds, suggesting the existence of an alternative metabolic route. Hormone content in <i>nced2569</i> seeds compared with <i>nced259</i> and wild type strongly suggested that specific expression of <i>NCED6</i> in the endosperm is mainly responsible for ABA production. In accordance, transcriptome analyses revealed broad similarities in gene expression between <i>nced2569</i> and either wild-type or <i>nced259</i> developing seeds. Gene ontology enrichments revealed a large spectrum of ABA activation targets involved in reserve storage and desiccation tolerance, and repression of photosynthesis and cell cycle. Proteome and metabolome profiles in dry <i>nced2569</i> seeds, compared with wild-type and <i>cyp707a1a2</i> seeds, also highlighted an inhibitory role of ABA on remobilization of reserves, reactive oxygen species production, and protein oxidation. Down-regulation of these oxidative processes by ABA may have an essential role in dormancy control.
