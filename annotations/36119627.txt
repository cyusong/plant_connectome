Soybean crop is regulated by abiotic and biotic stresses with great potential in reducing grain yield and quality. The selection of resistant cultivars is a promising approach for mitigating these damages. We evaluated the chemical profile of <i>Glycine max</i> leaves from different cultivars in order to explore their defense mechanisms against <i>Spodoptera cosmioides</i> caterpillars. We optimized solid-liquid extraction techniques using ultrasound bath and static headspace extraction. Additionally, we developed an approach based on liquid and gas chromatography for analyzing the chemical profile of <i>G. max</i> cultivars. The principal component analysis allowed the classification of transgenic cultivars, which are classified as susceptible to <i>S. cosmioides</i>, from those obtained by genetic improvement and resistant to the insect. Differences were observed in the abundance of phenolic glycosides, lipids, aldehydes, and alcohols. More specifically, <i>S. cosmioides</i> resistant cultivars presented molecules related to the jasmonic and salicylic acid pathways. Such data can contribute to a molecular understanding of phenotypic diversity in soybean cultivars, from plant quality to resistance mechanisms and adaptation, to environmental stress and herbivory.
