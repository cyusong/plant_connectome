Plant transformation has for many years relied on agrobacterium infection or biolistic particle delivery. However, these two methods are limited to model plant systems or a small number of crop species. This commentary highlights recent developments in the nanoparticle-mediated transformation that have the potential to revolutionize how plants are transformed.
