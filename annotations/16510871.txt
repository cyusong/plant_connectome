['16510871', 'Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) trigger innate immune responses in animals  and plants. One such PRR is the flagellin receptor FLS2 in Arabidopsis. Here, we  demonstrate that a functional fusion of FLS2 to the green fluorescent protein  (GFP) resides in cell membranes of most tissues. Stimulation with the flagellin  epitope flg22 induces its transfer into intracellular mobile vesicles, followed  by degradation. FLS2 internalization depends on cytoskeleton and proteasome  functions, and receptor activation. A variant FLS2 mutated in Thr 867, a  potential phosphorylation site, binds flg22 normally, but is impaired in flg22  responses and FLS2 endocytosis. We propose that plant cells regulate  pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-mediated PRR activities by  subcellular compartmentalization.', '2006 Mar 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.366506', 'Boller']
