Plant organ growth requires the proper transition from cell proliferation to cell expansion and differentiation. The CIN-TCP transcription factor gene TCP4 and its post-transcriptional regulator microRNA319 play a pivotal role in this process. In this study, we identified a pathway in which the product of the C2H2 zinc finger gene RABBIT EARS (RBE) regulates the transcription of TCP4 during Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) petal development. RBE directly represses TCP4 during the early stages of petal development; this contributes to the role of RBE in controlling the growth of petal primordia. We also found that the rbe-1 mutant strongly enhanced the petal phenotypes of tcp4soj6 and mir319a, two mutants with compromised miR319 regulation of TCP4 Our results show that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation function together to pattern the spatial and temporal expression of TCP4 This in turn controls petal size and shape in Arabidopsis.
