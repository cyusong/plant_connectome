['22334645', 'Many plants monitor day-length changes throughout the year and use the  information to precisely regulate the timing of seasonal flowering for maximum  reproductive success. In Arabidopsis thaliana, transcriptional regulation of the  CONSTANS (CO) gene and posttranslational regulation of CO protein are crucial  mechanisms for proper day-length measurement in photoperiodic flowering.  Currently, the CYCLING DOF FACTOR proteins are the only transcription factors  known to directly regulate CO gene expression, and the mechanisms that directly  activate CO transcription have remained unknown. Here we report the  identification of four CO transcriptional activators, named FLOWERING BHLH 1  (FBH1), FBH2, FBH3, and FBH4. All FBH proteins are related basic  helix-loop-helix-type transcription factors that preferentially bind to the E-box  cis-elements in the CO promoter. Overexpression of all FBH genes drastically  elevated CO levels and caused early flowering regardless of photoperiod, whereas  CO levels were reduced in the fbh quadruple mutants. In addition, FBH1 is  expressed in the vascular tissue and bound near the transcription start site of  the CO promoter in vivo. Furthermore, FBH homologs in poplar and rice induced CO  expression in Arabidopsis. These results indicate that FBH proteins positively  regulate CO transcription for photoperiodic flowering and that this mechanism may  be conserved in diverse plant species. Our results suggest that the diurnal CO  expression pattern is generated by a concert of redundant functions of positive  and negative transcriptional regulators.', '2012 Feb 28', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1118876109', 'Imaizumi']
