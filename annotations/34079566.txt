Disease lesion mimic (<i>Les</i>/<i>les</i>) mutants display disease-like spontaneous lesions in the absence of pathogen infection, implying the constitutive activation of defense responses. However, the genetic and biochemical bases underlying the activated defense responses in those mutants remain largely unknown. Here, we performed integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis on three typical maize <i>Les</i> mutants <i>Les4</i>, <i>Les10</i>, and <i>Les17</i> with large, medium, and small lesion size, respectively, thereby dissecting the activated defense responses at the transcriptional and metabolomic level. A total of 1,714, 4,887, and 1,625 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in <i>Les4</i>, <i>Les10</i>, and <i>Les17</i>, respectively. Among them, 570, 3,299, and 447 specific differentially expressed genes (SGs) were identified, implying a specific function of each <i>LES</i> gene. In addition, 480 common differentially expressed genes (CGs) and 42 common differentially accumulated metabolites (CMs) were identified in all <i>Les</i> mutants, suggesting the robust activation of shared signaling pathways. Intriguingly, substantial analysis of the CGs indicated that genes involved in the programmed cell death, defense responses, and phenylpropanoid and terpenoid biosynthesis were most commonly activated. Genes involved in photosynthetic biosynthesis, however, were generally repressed. Consistently, the dominant CMs identified were phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. In particular, lignin, the phenylpropanoid-based polymer, was significantly increased in all three mutants. These data collectively imply that transcriptional activation of defense-related gene expression; increase of phenylpropanoid, lignin, flavonoid, and terpenoid biosynthesis; and inhibition of photosynthesis are generalnatures associated with the lesion formation and constitutively activated defense responses in those mutants. Further studies on the identified SGs and CGs will shed new light on the function of each <i>LES</i> gene as well as the regulatory network of defense responses in maize.
