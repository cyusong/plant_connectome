ABA/GA<sub>4</sub> ratio, stress resistance, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and chromatin structure play important roles in vigour differences of seeds located at different maize ear positions. Seed vigour, which ensures rapid and uniform field emergence across diverse environments, differs at different maize ear positions. However, little is known regarding the associated mechanisms. In this study, we determined that seed vigour, stress resistance, and carbon and nitrogen metabolism were higher in seeds from middle and bottom section of the ear, while the ABA/GA<sub>4</sub> ratio in the embryos was significantly lower. Compared with the seeds subjected to repeated pollination during silking, less variation in seed vigour and the ABA/GA<sub>4</sub> ratio in the embryos was observed in seeds at different ear positions subjected to single pollination after complete silking. This indicated that single pollination can reduce, but not eliminate, the differences in seed vigour at different ear positions. RNA-seq analysis indicated that the seed vigour differences at the different locations of the maize ears of the single pollinated treatment were related to carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In contrast, the differences in seed vigour under repeated pollination were related to chromatin structure. The present study contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying differences in seed vigour at different positions on the maize ear.
