Six commercial biocontrol agents (BCAs, containing <i>Aureobasidium pullulans, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, Pythium oligandrum</i>, or <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i>) were applied to ripening berries that were then incubated at one of four temperatures (T, 15, 20, 25, and 30°C) and one of four relative humidity levels (RH, 60, 80, 90, and 100%). After 1 to 13 days of incubation (BCA colonization period), the berries were inoculated with conidia of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and kept at 25°C and 100% RH for 7 days, at which time Botrytis bunch rot (BBR) was assessed. The response of BBR control to T/RH conditions and BCA colonization period differed among BCAs; the coefficients of variation among the BCAs ranged from 44.7 to 72.4%. An equation was developed that accounted for the combined effects of T, RH, and BCA colonization period on BBR control. The equation, which had an R<sup>2</sup>>0.94, could help farmers select the BCA to be used for a specific application based on weather conditions at the time of treatment and in the following days.
