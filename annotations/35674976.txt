Plant cell walls are highly dynamic and chemically complex structures surrounding all plant cells. They provide structural support, protection from both abiotic and biotic stress as well as ensure containment of turgor. Recently evidence has accumulated that a dedicated mechanism exists in plants, which is monitoring the functional integrity of cell walls and initiates adaptive responses to maintain integrity in case it is impaired during growth, development or exposure to biotic and abiotic stress. The available evidence indicates that detection of impairment involves mechano-perception, while reactive oxygen species and phytohormone-based signaling processes play key roles in translating signals generated and regulating adaptive responses. More recently it has also become obvious that the mechanisms mediating cell wall integrity maintenance and pattern triggered immunity are interacting with each other to modulate the adaptive responses to biotic stress and cell wall integrity impairment. Here we will review initially our current knowledge regarding the mode of action of the maintenance mechanism, discuss mechanisms mediating responses to biotic stresses and highlight how both mechanisms may modulate adaptive responses. This first part will be focused on Arabidopsis thaliana since most of the relevant knowledge derives from this model organism. We will then proceed to provide perspective to what extent the relevant molecular mechanisms are conserved in other plant species and close by discussing current knowledge of the transcriptional machinery responsible for controlling the adaptive responses using selected examples.

Reactive oxygen species: !signals! Adaptive responses 
Phytohormones: !signals! Adaptive responses 
Cell wall integrity maintenance: !interacts with! Pattern triggered immunity
