1RS.1BL translocations are centric translocations formed by misdivision and have been used extensively in wheat breeding. However, the role that the centromere plays in the formation of 1RS.1BL translocations is still unclear. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied to detect the fine structures of the centromeres in 130 1RS.1BL translocation cultivars. Immuno-FISH, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR and RT-PCR were used to investigate the functions of the hybrid centromeres in 1RS.1BL translocations. New 1R translocations with different centromere structures were created by misdivision and pollen irradiation to elucidate the role that the centromere plays in the formation of 1RS.1BL translocations. We found that all of the 1RS.1BL translocations detected contained hybrid centromeres and that wheat-derived CENH3 bound to both the wheat and rye centromeres in the 1RS.1BL translocation chromosomes. Moreover, a rye centromere-specific retrotransposon was actively transcribed in 1RS.1BL translocations. The frequencies of new 1RS hybrid centromere translocations and group-1 chromosome translocations were higher during 1R misdivision. Our study demonstrates the hybrid nature of the centromere in 1RS.1BL translocations. New 1R translocations with different centromere structures were created to help understand the fusion centromere used for wheat breeding and for use as breeding material for the improvement of wheat.
