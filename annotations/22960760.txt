Plant-parasitic cyst nematodes form a specialized feeding site, termed a syncytium, in the roots of host plants. Monoclonal antibodies to defined glycans, in addition to a cellulose-binding module, were used to characterize the cell walls of a functioning syncytia in situ. Cell walls of syncytia were found to contain cellulose, xyloglucan and mannan. Analysis of the pectin network revealed syncytial cell walls are abundant in homogalacturonan, which was heavily methyl-esterified. Arabinan was also detected and the results suggest the cell walls of syncytia are highly flexible.
