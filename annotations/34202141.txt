Intestinal symbiotic bacteria have played an important role in the digestion, immunity detoxification, mating, and reproduction of insects during long-term coevolution. The oriental fruit moth, <i>Grapholita molesta</i>, is an important fruit tree pest worldwide. However, the composition of the <i>G. molesta</i> microbial community, especially of the gut microbiome, remains unclear. To explore the differences of gut microbiota of <i>G. molesta</i> when reared on different host plants, we determined the gut bacterial structure when <i>G. molesta</i> was transferred from an artificial diet to different host plants (apples, peaches, nectarines, crisp pears, plums, peach shoots) by amplicon sequencing technology. The results showed that Proteobacteria and Firmicutes are dominant in the gut microbiota of <i>G. molesta</i>. Plum-feeding <i>G. molesta</i> had the highest richness and diversity of gut microbiota, while apple-feeding <i>G. molesta</i> had the lowest. PCoA and PERMANOVA analysis revealed that there were significant differences in the gut microbiota structure of <i>G. molesta</i> on different diets. PICRUSt2 analysis indicated that most of the functional prediction pathways were concentrated in metabolic and cellular processes. Our results confirmed that gut bacterial communities of <i>G. molesta</i> can be influenced by host diets and may play an important role in host adaptation.
