Accurate development of the gynoecium, the female reproductive organ, is necessary to achieve efficient fertilization. In Arabidopsis, the correct patterning of the apical-basal axis of the gynoecium requires the establishment of a morphogenic gradient of auxin. This allows the production of specialized tissues, whose roles consist of attracting pollen, allowing pollen tube growth and protecting the ovules within the ovaries. Mutations in the bHLH transcription factor SPATULA (SPT) are known to impair the development of the apical tissues of the gynoecium. Here, we show that the spt phenotype is rescued by the removal of phytochrome B, and discuss how light signaling may control flower development.

SPT: !affects! Gynoecium development 
Auxin: !establishes! Morphogenic gradient 
Pollen: !attracted by! Specialized tissues 
Pollen tube: !allowed to grow by! Specialized tissues 
Ovules: !protected by! Specialized tissues 
SPT: !rescued by! Removal of phytochrome B 
Light signaling: !controls! Flower development
