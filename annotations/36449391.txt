Increase in ambient temperatures caused by climate change affects various morphological and developmental traits of plants, threatening crop yield stability. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) plays prominent roles in temperature sensing and thermomorphogenesis signal transduction. However, how crop species respond to elevated temperatures is poorly understood. Here, we show that the barley ortholog of AtELF3 interacts with high temperature to control growth and development. We used heterogeneous inbred family (HIF) pairs generated from a segregating mapping population and systematically studied the role of exotic ELF3 variants in barley temperature responses. An exotic ELF3 allele from Syrian origin promoted elongation growth in barley at elevated temperatures, whereas plant area and estimated biomass were drastically reduced, resulting in an open canopy architecture. The same allele accelerated inflorescence development at high temperature, which correlated with early transcriptional induction of MADS-box floral identity genes BM3 and BM8. Consequently, barley plants carrying the exotic ELF3 allele displayed stable total grain number at elevated temperatures. Our findings therefore demonstrate that exotic ELF3 variants can contribute to phenotypic and developmental acclimation to elevated temperatures, providing a stimulus for breeding of climate resilient crops.
