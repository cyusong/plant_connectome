Epigenetic regulation controls multiple aspects of the plant development. The N-terminal tail of histone can be differently modified to regulate various chromatin activities. One of them, the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) confers a repressive chromatin state with gene silencing. H3K27me3 is dynamically deposited and removed throughout development. While components of the H3K27me3 writer, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), have been reported for almost 2 decades, it is only recently that JUMONJI (JMJ) proteins are reported as H3K27me3 demethylases, affirming the dynamic nature of histone modifications. This review highlights recent progress in plant epigenetic research, focusing on the H3K27me3 demethylases.
