Germination negatively affects adventitious shoot formation induced by cytokinins in pine cotyledons. To investigate the causes of this decrease in the organogenic response, uptake and metabolism of benzyladenine (BA) were studied in stone pine cotyledons (Pinus pinea) isolated from in vitro germinating embryos and cultured in bud induction medium. As embryos grew, cotyledons showed a progressive decrease in the amount of BA taken up from the medium. BA was barely metabolized; however, a BA metabolite previously undescribed in conifers was found. It was identified as a glucoside of the BA riboside, a type of metabolite recently described in other gymnosperms. Data revealed that differences in the organogenic capacity of P. pinea cotyledons associated with embryo germination are related primarily to their ability to absorb BA from the bud induction medium.
