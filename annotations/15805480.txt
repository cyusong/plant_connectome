['15805480', 'Plants acclimate to variations in light intensity by changing the antenna size of  photosystems. This acclimation allows them to undergo efficient photosynthesis  and creates a protective strategy to minimize photodamage. Chlorophyll b  synthesis by chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO) is a key regulatory step in the  control of antenna size. Recently, we found that higher plant CAOs consist of  three domains (A, B, and C domains) and confirmed that the C domain possesses  catalytic function. To investigate the function of the A domain, we fused various  combinations of these three domains with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and  introduced them into Arabidopsis thaliana. When a full-length CAO-GFP fusion  protein was introduced into a chlorophyll b-less chlorina1-1 mutant, chlorophyll  b accumulated to almost the same levels as in the chlorophyll b-containing  Columbia wild type, but the CAO-GFP could not be detected by immunoblotting. By  contrast, when a GFP-C domain fusion was introduced into chlorina1-1 or Columbia  wild type, a large amount of GFP-C domain protein accumulated and the chlorophyll  a/b ratio decreased drastically from 3.6 to 2.2 in Columbia wild type. When an A  domain-GFP was introduced into Columbia wild type, A domain-GFP levels were very  low. Conversely, a large amount of the protein accumulated when it was introduced  into the chlorina1-1 mutant. These results indicate that the A domain may sense  the presence of chlorophyll b and regulate the accumulation of CAO protein in the  chloroplasts.', '2005 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.031518', 'Tanaka']
