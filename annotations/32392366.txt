In self-incompatible Solanaceae, the pistil protein S-RNase contributes to S-specific pollen rejection in conspecific crosses, as well as to rejecting pollen from foreign species or whole clades. However, S-RNase alone is not sufficient for either type of pollen rejection. We describe a thioredoxin (Trx) type h from Nicotiana alata, NaTrxh, which interacts with and reduces S-RNase in vitro. Here, we show that expressing a redox-inactive mutant, NaTrxh<sub>SS</sub> , suppresses both S-specific pollen rejection and rejection of pollen from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. Biochemical experiments provide evidence that NaTrxh specifically reduces the Cys<sub>155</sub> -Cys<sub>185</sub> disulphide bond of S<sub>C10</sub> -Rnase, resulting in a significant increase of its ribonuclease activity. This reduction and increase in S-RNase activity by NaTrxh helps to explain why S-RNase alone could be insufficient for pollen rejection.
