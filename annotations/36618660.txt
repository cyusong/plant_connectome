Green microalgae can accumulate neutral lipids, as part of a general lipid remodeling mechanism under stress such as nitrogen starvation. <i>Lobosphaera incisa</i> is of special interest because of its unique TAG acyl chain composition, especially 20:4 (n-6) can reach up to 21% of dry weight after nitrogen starvation. In order to identify factors that may influence the accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), we identified recently a linoleate 13-lipoxygenase (LiLOX). It shares highest identity with plastidic enzymes from vascular plants and is induced upon nitrogen starvation. Here, we confirmed the localization of LiLOX in the stroma of plastids <i>via</i> transient expression in epithelial onion cells. In order to further characterize this enzyme, we focused on the identification of the endogenous substrate of LiLOX. In this regard, an <i>ex vivo</i> enzymatic assay, coupled with non-targeted analysis <i>via</i> mass spectrometry allowed the identification of MGDG, DGDG and PC as three substrate candidates, later confirmed <i>via in vitro</i> assays. Further investigation revealed that LiLOX has preferences towards the lipid class MGDG, which seems in agreement with its localization in the galactolipid rich plastid. Altogether, this study shows the first characterization of plastidic LOX from green algae, showing preference for MGDGs. However, lipidomics analysis did neither reveal an endogenous LiLOX product nor the final end product of MGDG oxidation. Nevertheless, the latter is a key to understanding the role of this enzyme and since its expression is highest during the degradation of the plastidic membrane, it is tempting to assume its involvement in this process.
