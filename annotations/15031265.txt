['15031265', 'Mutant analysis has been tremendously successful in deciphering the genetics of  plant development. However, less is known about the molecular basis of  morphological variation within species, which is caused by naturally occurring  alleles. In this study, we succeeded in isolating a novel regulator of root  growth by exploiting natural genetic variation in the model plant Arabidopsis.  Quantitative trait locus analysis of a cross between isogenized accessions  revealed that a single locus is responsible for approximately 80% of the variance  of the observed difference in root length. This gene, named BREVIS RADIX (BRX),  controls the extent of cell proliferation and elongation in the growth zone of  the root tip. We isolated BRX by positional cloning. BRX is a member of a small  group of highly conserved genes, the BRX gene family, which is only found in  multicellular plants. Analyses of Arabidopsis single and double mutants suggest  that BRX is the only gene of this family with a role in root development. The BRX  protein is nuclear localized and activates transcription in a heterologous yeast  system, indicating that BRX family proteins represent a novel class of  transcription factors. Thus, we have identified a novel regulatory factor  controlling quantitative aspects of root growth.', '2004 Mar 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1187704', 'Hardtke']
