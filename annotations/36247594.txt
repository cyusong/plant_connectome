Fusarium crown rot (FCR), caused by various <i>Fusarium</i> species, is a primary fungal disease in most wheat-growing regions worldwide. <i>A. tauschii</i>, the diploid wild progenitor of the D-genome of common wheat, is a reservoir of genetic diversity for improving bread wheat biotic and abiotic resistance/tolerance. A worldwide collection of 286 <i>A. tauschii</i> accessions was used to evaluate FCR resistance. Population structure analysis revealed that 115 belonged to the <i>A. tauschii</i> ssp. <i>strangulata</i> subspecies, and 171 belonged to the <i>A. tauschii</i> ssp. <i>tauschii</i> subspecies. Five accessions with disease index values lower than 20 showed moderate resistance to FCR. These five originated from Afghanistan, China, Iran, Uzbekistan, and Turkey, all belonging to the <i>tauschii</i> subspecies. Genome-wide association mapping using 6,739 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed that two SNPs on chromosome 2D and four SNPs on chromosome 7D were significantly associated with FCR resistance. Almost all FCR resistance alleles were presented in accessions from the <i>tauschii</i> subspecies, and only 4, 11, and 19 resistance alleles were presented in accessions from the <i>strangulata</i> subspecies. Combining phenotypic correlation analysis and genome-wide association mapping confirmed that FCR resistance loci were independent of flowering time, heading date, and plant height in this association panel. Six genes encoding disease resistance-related proteins were selected as candidates for further validation. The identified resistant <i>A. tauschii</i> accessions will provide robust resistance gene sources for breeding FCR-resistant cultivars. The associated loci/genes will accelerate and improve FCR in breeding programs by deploying marker-assisted selection.
