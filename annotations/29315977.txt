Maize white seedling 3 (w3) has been used to study carotenoid deficiency for almost 100 years, although the molecular basis of the mutation has remained unknown. Here we show that the w3 phenotype is caused by disruption of the maize gene for homogentisate solanesyl transferase (HST), which catalyzes the first and committed step in plastoquinone-9 (PQ-9) biosynthesis in the plastid. The resulting PQ-9 deficiency prohibits photosynthetic electron transfer and eliminates PQ-9 as an oxidant in the enzymatic desaturation of phytoene during carotenoid synthesis. As a result, light-grown w3 seedlings are albino, deficient in colored carotenoids and accumulate high levels of phytoene. However, despite the absence of PQ-9 for phytoene desaturation, dark-grown w3 seedlings can produce abscisic acid (ABA) and homozygous w3 kernels accumulate sufficient carotenoids to generate ABA needed for seed maturation. The presence of ABA and low levels of carotenoids in w3 nulls indicates that phytoene desaturase is able to use an alternate oxidant cofactor, albeit less efficiently than PQ-9. The observation that tocopherols and tocotrienols are modestly affected in w3 embryos and unaffected in w3 endosperm indicates that, unlike leaves, grain tissues deficient in PQ-9 are not subject to severe photo-oxidative stress. In addition to identifying the molecular basis for the maize w3 mutant, we: (1) show that low levels of phytoene desaturation can occur in w3 seedlings in the absence of PQ-9; and (2) demonstrate that PQ-9 and carotenoids are not required for vitamin E accumulation.

HST: !catalyzes! PQ-9 biosynthesis
PQ-9: !prohibits! photosynthetic electron transfer
PQ-9: !eliminates! oxidant in carotenoid synthesis
phytoene desaturase: !uses! alternate oxidant cofactor
ABA: !accumulates! in w3 nulls
tocopherols/tocotrienols: !modestly affected! in w3 embryos
