Rice is a major food crop that sustains approximately half of the world population. Recent worldwide improvements in the standard of living have increased the demand for high-quality rice. Accurate identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for rice grain quality traits will facilitate rice quality breeding and improvement. In the present study, we performed high-resolution QTL mapping for rice grain quality traits using a genotyping-by-sequencing approach. An F<sub>2</sub> population derived from a cross between an elite <i>japonica</i> variety, Koshihikari, and an <i>indica</i> variety, Nona Bokra, was used to construct a high-density genetic map. A total of 3,830 single nucleotide polymorphism markers were mapped to 12 linkage groups spanning a total length of 2,456.4 cM, with an average genetic distance of 0.82 cM. Seven grain quality traits-the percentage of whole grain, percentage of head rice, percentage of area of head rice, transparency, percentage of chalky rice, percentage of chalkiness area, and degree of chalkiness-of the F<sub>2</sub> population were investigated. In total, 15 QTLs with logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores >4 were identified, which mapped to chromosomes 6, 7, and 9. These loci include four QTLs for transparency, four for percentage of chalky rice, four for percentage of chalkiness area, and three for degree of chalkiness, accounting for 0.01%-61.64% of the total phenotypic variation. Of these QTLs, only one overlapped with previously reported QTLs, and the others were novel. By comparing the major QTL regions in the rice genome, several key candidate genes reported to play crucial roles in grain quality traits were identified. These findings will expedite the fine mapping of these QTLs and QTL pyramiding, which will facilitate the genetic improvement of rice grain quality.
