The meristem is the most functionally dynamic part in a plant. The shaping of the meristem requires constant cell division and elongation, which are influenced by hormones and the cytoskeletal component, actin. Although the roles of hormones in modulating meristem development have been extensively studied, the role of actin in this process is still elusive. Using the single and double mutants of the vegetative class actin, we demonstrate that actin isovariant ACT7 plays an important role in root meristem development. In the absence of ACT7, but not ACT8 and ACT2, depolymerization of actin was observed. Consistently, the act7 mutant showed reduced cell division, cell elongation, and meristem length. Intracellular distribution and trafficking of auxin transport proteins in the actin mutants revealed that ACT7 specifically functions in the root meristem to facilitate the trafficking of auxin efflux carriers PIN1 and PIN2, and consequently the transport of auxin. Compared with act7, the act7act8 double mutant exhibited slightly enhanced phenotypic response and altered intracellular trafficking. The altered distribution of auxin in act7 and act7act8 affects the response of the roots to ethylene, but not to cytokinin. Collectively, our results suggest that ACT7-dependent auxin-ethylene response plays a key role in controlling Arabidopsis root meristem development.
