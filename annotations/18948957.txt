['18948957', 'Flowering plants possess a unique reproductive strategy, involving double  fertilization by twin sperm cells. Unlike animal germ lines, the male germ cell  lineage in plants only forms after meiosis and involves asymmetric division of  haploid microspores, to produce a large, non-germline vegetative cell and a germ  cell that undergoes one further division to produce the twin sperm cells.  Although this switch in cell cycle control is critical for sperm cell production  and delivery, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here we identify a  novel F-box protein of Arabidopsis thaliana, designated FBL17 (F-box-like 17),  that enables this switch by targeting the degradation of cyclin-dependent kinase  A;1 inhibitors specifically in male germ cells. We show that FBL17 is transiently  expressed in the male germ line after asymmetric division and forms an  SKP1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (SCF(FBL17)) that  targets the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors KRP6 and KRP7 for  proteasome-dependent degradation. Accordingly, the loss of FBL17 function leads  to the stabilization of KRP6 and inhibition of germ cell cycle progression. Our  results identify SCF(FBL17) as an essential male germ cell proliferation complex  that promotes twin sperm cell production and double fertilization in flowering  plants.', '2008 Oct 23', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature07289', 'Nam']
