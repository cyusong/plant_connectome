['19914588', 'The function and metabolic pathway of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (KDO) are  unclear in plants although it is an essential component in plant cell wall. Here  we cloned and characterized a putative Arabidopsis thaliana cytidine  monophosphate-KDO synthetase to understand synthetic pathways of KDO. It showed a  ubiquitous expression, the activity at an optimal pH of 8.0, and a requirement of  Mg2+.', '2009 Dec', 'J Biosci Bioeng', '10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.05.022', 'Seki']
