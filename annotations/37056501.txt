Soil salinity is a major constraint for soybean production worldwide, and the exploitation of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) and their bioactive metabolite(s) can improve plant salinity tolerance. With this objective, two experiments were performed, aiming to test 4 culture media (YEM(A), TYE(A), TS(A), and LB(A)) for growing a novel <i>Devosia</i> sp. (strain SL43), and then evaluating cell-free supernatants (CFS) from the <i>Devosia</i> sp. on germination of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> L.) seeds under salinity stress. Soybean seeds were subjected to three salinity levels (0, 100, and 125 mM NaCl) and 6 levels of <i>Devosia</i> sp. CFS dilution (0, 1:1, 1:100, 1:250, 1:500, 1:1000). The results indicated that 125 mM NaCl concentration caused the greatest reduction in the total number of germinated seeds (15%), germination rate (43.6%), root length (55.2%), root weight (39.3%), and seed vigor (68%), and it also increased mean germination time by 71.9%. However, <i>Devosia</i>-CFS improved soybean germination, and the greatest effect was obtained at 1:1 dilution. Under the highest salinity level, application of CFS at 1:1 dilution increased final germination (17.6%), germination rate (18.6%), root length (162.2%), root weight (239.4%), seed vigor index (318.7%), and also shortening mean germination time by 19.2%. The results indicated that seed vigor index was positively correlated with other traits except for mean germination time. Our study suggested that the highest productivity of Devoisa sp. was obtained from the YEM medium. Results also suggested that CFS produced by the novel Devosia sp. (SL43 strain) can successfully alleviate salt stress effects on soybean seed germination and manipulating the chemical composition of the growth medium can influence the effectiveness of these bioactive metabolites.
