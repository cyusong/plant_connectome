Gamete fusion activates the egg in animals and plants, and the gamete fusion site on the zygote might provide a possible cue for zygotic development and/or embryonic patterning. In angiosperms, a zygote generally divides into a two-celled proembryo consisting of an apical and a basal cell with different cell fates. This is a putative step in the formation of the apical-basal axis of the proembryo. We observed the positional relationship between the gamete fusion site and the division plane formed by zygotic cleavage using an in vitro fertilization system with rice gametes. There was no relationship between the gamete fusion site and the division plane leading to the two-celled proembryo. Thus, the gamete fusion site on the rice zygote does not appear to function as a determinant for positioning the zygote division plane, and the zygote apparently possesses autonomous potential to establish cell polarity along the apical-basal axis for its first cleavage.
