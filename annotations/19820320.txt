The proper regulation of enlargement and patterning of plant lateral organs is essential for plant functionality. In an earlier work, we characterized the role of a microRNA (miRNA)-transcription factor regulatory module, miRNA164-CUC2, in the enlargement and patterning of multiple lateral organs in Arabidopsis. This regulatory module genetically interacts with another transcription factor, CRC, in fruit development patterning. Here, we characterize the genetic interaction of this module with a homeodomain transcription factor, BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP), that has been shown to play roles in leaf development patterning.
