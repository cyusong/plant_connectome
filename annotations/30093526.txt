['30093526', 'Successful pollen tube elongation is critical for double fertilization, but the  biological functions of pollen tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying  this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed  two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) SAUR (SMALL AUXIN UP RNA) genes, SAUR62  and SAUR75, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that  both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to pollen tube nuclei. The siliques of  homozygous saur62 (saur62/-), saur75 (saur75/-), and the SAUR62/75 RNA  interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal  pollen viability but defective in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth, with  branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers  revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting  partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast  two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Polysome  profiling showed reduced 80S ribosome abundance in homozygous saur62, saur75,  ribosomal large subunit12c, and SAUR62/75 RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75  play roles in ribosome assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we  analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for  relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of  factors participating in pollen tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which  are critical for the elastic properties of tube elongation. Indeed, RNAi pollen  tubes showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin  organization. Thus, the biological roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners  are critical in ribosomal pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient pollen tube  elongation and subsequent fertilization.', '2018 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.18.00257', 'ORCID:']
