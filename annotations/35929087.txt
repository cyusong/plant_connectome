Lipid droplets (LDs) are evolutionarily conserved organelles that serve as hubs of cellular lipid and energy metabolism in virtually all organisms. Mobilization of LDs is important in light-induced stomatal opening. However, whether and how LDs are involved in stomatal development remains unknown. We show here that Arabidopsis thaliana LIPID DROPLETS AND STOMATA 1 (LDS1)/RABC1 (At1g43890) encodes a member of the Rab GTPase family that is involved in regulating LD dynamics and stomatal morphogenesis. The expression of RABC1 is coordinated with the different phases of stomatal development. RABC1 targets to the surface of LDs in response to oleic acid application in a RABC1GEF1-dependent manner. RABC1 physically interacts with SEIPIN2/3, two orthologues of mammalian seipin, which function in the formation of LDs. Disruption of RABC1, RABC1GEF1, or SEIPIN2/3 resulted in aberrantly large LDs, severe defects in guard cell vacuole morphology, and stomatal function. In conclusion, these findings reveal an aspect of LD function and uncover a role for lipid metabolism in stomatal development in plants.
