Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), caused by <i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), is one of the most destructive citrus diseases worldwide, yet how Las causes HLB is poorly understood. Here we show that a Las-secreted protein, SDE15 (CLIBASIA_04025), suppresses plant immunity and promotes Las multiplication. Transgenic expression of SDE15 in Duncan grapefruit (<i>Citrus × paradisi</i>) suppresses the hypersensitive response induced by <i>Xanthomonas citri</i> ssp. <i>citri</i> (<i>Xcc</i>) and reduces the expression of immunity-related genes. SDE15 also suppresses the hypersensitive response triggered by the <i>Xanthomonas vesicatoria</i> effector protein AvrBsT in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, suggesting that it may be a broad-spectrum suppressor of plant immunity. SDE15 interacts with the citrus protein CsACD2, a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 2 (ACD2). SDE15 suppression of plant immunity is dependent on <i>CsACD2</i>, and overexpression of <i>CsACD2</i> in citrus suppresses plant immunity and promotes Las multiplication, phenocopying overexpression of SDE15. Identification of CsACD2 as a susceptibility target has implications in genome editing for novel plant resistance against devastating HLB.
