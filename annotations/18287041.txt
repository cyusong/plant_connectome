['18287041', 'LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) is a central regulator of embryogenesis sufficient to  induce somatic cells to form embryos when expressed ectopically. Here, we analyze  the cellular processes induced by LEC2, a B3 domain transcription factor, that  may underlie its ability to promote somatic embryogenesis. We show  auxin-responsive genes are induced after LEC2 activation in seedlings. Genes  encoding enzymes involved in auxin biosynthesis, YUC2 and YUC4, are activated  within 1 h after induction of LEC2 activity, and YUC4 appears to be a direct  transcriptional target of LEC2. We also show ectopic LEC2 expression induces  accumulation of seed storage protein and oil bodies in vegetative and  reproductive organs, events that normally occur during the maturation phase of  embryogenesis. Furthermore, LEC2 activates seed protein genes before an increase  in RNAs encoding LEC1 or FUS3 is observed. Thus, LEC2 causes rapid changes in  auxin responses and induces cellular differentiation characteristic of the  maturation phase. The relevance of these changes to the ability of LEC2 to  promote somatic embryogenesis is discussed.', '2008 Feb 26', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0712364105', 'Harada']
