Infection of plant cells by RNA viruses leads to the generation of organelle-like subcellular structures that contain the viral replication complex. During <i>Turnip mosaic virus</i> (TuMV) infection of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, the viral membrane protein 6K<sub>2</sub> plays a key role in the release of motile replication vesicles from the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we demonstrate that 6K<sub>2</sub> contains a GxxxG motif within its predicted transmembrane domain that is vital for TuMV infection. Replacement of the Gly with Val within this motif inhibited virus production, and this was due to a relocation of the viral protein to the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. This indicated that passage of 6K<sub>2</sub> through the Golgi apparatus is a dead-end avenue for virus infection. Impairing the fusion of transport vesicles between the ER and the Golgi apparatus by overexpression of the SNARE Sec22 protein resulted in enhanced intercellular virus movement. Likewise, expression of nonfunctional, Golgi-located synaptotagmin during infection enhanced TuMV intercellular movement. 6K<sub>2</sub> copurified with VTI11, a prevacuolar compartment SNARE protein. An <i>Arabidopsis thaliana vti11</i> mutant was completely resistant to TuMV infection. We conclude that TuMV replication vesicles bypass the Golgi apparatus and take an unconventional pathway that may involve prevacuolar compartments/multivesicular bodies for virus infection.
