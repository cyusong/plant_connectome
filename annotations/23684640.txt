Oil crops are in increasing demand both for food and as renewable sources of chemicals. It is therefore vital to understand how oil accumulation is regulated. Different ways of obtaining such information are discussed with an emphasis on metabolic control analysis. The usefulness of the latter has been well-illustrated by its application to help raise yields in oilseed rape.
