['12232400', 'A novel mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, arc6 (accumulation and replication of  chloroplasts), has been isolated from a transfer DNA-mutagenized population of  Arabidopsis seedlings. arc6 has the most extreme arc mutant phenotype we have yet  described, with only one to three chloroplasts per leaf mesophyll cell compared  to a mean of 83 in cells of the wild-type var Wassilewskija. The chloroplasts of  arc6 are 20-fold larger than wild-type chloroplasts.Chloroplast division is  almost certainly precluded in arc6 mesophyll cells, since chloroplast number per  cell does not increase during mesophyll cell expansion. arc6 chloroplasts are  long and thin in cross-section and only one-half the width of wild-type  chloroplasts and the arrangement of thylakoid membranes is largely unaltered.  arc6 segregates as a monogenic recessive nuclear mutation in a normal Mendelian  manner and the arc6 phenotype is stably inherited for at least four generations.  arc6 plants grow normally and are fertile, although the rosette leaves appear  curled and twisted. arc6 plants accumulate 70 to 75% of the biomass of wild type.  The phenotype of this novel mutant is discussed in relation to the nature of the  control of chloroplast division in leaf cells.', '1994 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.3.1169', 'Leech']
