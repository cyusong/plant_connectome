The plant extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid-enveloped nano-particles containing proteins, nucleic acids and metabolites and function in plant development and response. The <i>Arabidopsis</i> four transmembrane protein TETRASPANIN 8 (TET8) knock-out mutant <i>tet8</i> secreted less EVs than the wild-type (WT). In this report, we show that the <i>tet8</i> mutant was attenuated in the plant hormone jasmonate (JA) accumulation in response to mechanical wounding treatment. We also noticed that the EVs contained a high level of phospholipids phosphatidic acids (PAs) which may serve as precursors of JA biosynthesis during wound-triggered-self-healing processes. Thus, we propose an open question about a potential role of EVs or TET8 or both in damage-associated JA response.
