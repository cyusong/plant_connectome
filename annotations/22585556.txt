['22585556', 'Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase  comprised of a catalytic subunit (PP1c) and a regulatory subunit that modulates  catalytic activity, subcellular localization and substrate specificity. PP1c  positively regulates stomatal opening through blue light signaling between  phototropins and the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase in guard cells. However, the  regulatory subunit functioning in this process is unknown. We identified  Arabidopsis PRSL1 (PP1 regulatory subunit2-like protein1) as a regulatory subunit  of PP1c. Tautomycin, a selective inhibitor of PP1c, inhibited blue light  responses of stomata in the single mutants phot1 and phot2, supporting the idea  that signals from phot1 and phot2 converge on PP1c. We obtained PRSL1 based on  the sequence similarity to Vicia faba PRS2, a PP1c-binding protein isolated by a  yeast two-hybrid screen. PRSL1 bound to Arabidopsis PP1c through its RVxF motif,  a consensus PP1c-binding sequence. Arabidopsis prsl1 mutants were impaired in  blue light-dependent stomatal opening, H(+) pumping and phosphorylation of the  H(+)-ATPase, but showed normal phototropin activities. PRSL1 complemented the  prsl1 phenotype, but not if the protein carried a mutation in the RVxF motif,  suggesting that PRSL1 functions through binding PP1c via the RVxF motif. PRSL1  did not affect the catalytic activity of Arabidopsis PP1c but it stimulated the  localization of PP1c in the cytoplasm. We conclude that PRSL1 functions as a  regulatory subunit of PP1 and regulates blue light signaling in stomata.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcs073', 'Shimazaki']
