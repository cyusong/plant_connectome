Lily (<i>Lilium</i> spp.) has elegant flowers and beautiful colors, which makes it popular among people. However, the poor stress resistance and self-propagation ability of lily limit its application in landscaping to a great extent. In addition, transgenic technology is an important means to improve plant characteristics, but the lack of a stable and efficient genetic transformation system is still an important factor restricting the development of lily transgenic technology. Therefore, this study established a good lily regeneration system by screening different explants and plant growth regulators of different concentrations. Then, the genetic transformation system of lily was optimized by screening the critical concentration of antibiotics, the concentration of bacterial solution, and the infection time. Finally, the homologous lily cold resistance gene <i>LlNAC2</i> and bulblet generation gene <i>LaKNOX1</i> were successfully transferred to 'Siberia' and 'Sorbonne' to obtain lily transgenic lines. The results showed that when the stem axis was used as explant in 'Siberia', the induction rate was as high as 87%. The induction rate of 'Sorbonne' was as high as 91.7% when the filaments were used as explants. At the same time, in the optimized genetic transformation system, the transformation rate of 'Siberia' and 'Sorbonne' was up to 60%. In conclusion, this study provides the theoretical basis and technical support for improving the resistance and reproductive ability of Oriental lily and the molecular breeding of lily.
