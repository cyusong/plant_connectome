['25340959', 'Chitin is a fungal microbe-associated molecular pattern recognized in Arabidopsis  by a lysin motif receptor kinase (LYK), AtCERK1. Previous research suggested that  AtCERK1 is the major chitin receptor and mediates chitin-induced signaling  through homodimerization and phosphorylation. However, the reported chitin  binding affinity of AtCERK1 is quite low, suggesting another receptor with high  chitin binding affinity might be present. Here, we propose that AtLYK5 is the  primary chitin receptor in Arabidopsis. Mutations in AtLYK5 resulted in a  significant reduction in chitin response. However, AtLYK5 shares overlapping  function with AtLYK4 and, therefore, Atlyk4/Atlyk5-2 double mutants show a  complete loss of chitin response. AtLYK5 interacts with AtCERK1 in a  chitin-dependent manner. Chitin binding to AtLYK5 is indispensable for  chitin-induced AtCERK1 phosphorylation. AtLYK5 binds chitin at a much higher  affinity than AtCERK1. The data suggest that AtLYK5 is the primary receptor for  chitin, forming a chitin inducible complex with AtCERK1 to induce plant immunity.', '2014 Oct 23', 'Elife', '10.7554/eLife.03766', 'Stacey']
