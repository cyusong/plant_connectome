['22545860', 'The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) acyltransferase, encoded by lpxA,  catalyzes the first step of lipid A biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria, the  (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-ACP-dependent acylation of the 3-OH group of UDP-GlcNAc.  Recently, we demonstrated that the Arabidopsis thaliana orthologs of six enzymes  of the bacterial lipid A pathway produce lipid A precursors with structures  similar to those of Escherichia coli lipid A precursors [Li, C., et al. (2011)  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 108, 11387-11392]. To build upon this finding, we  have cloned, purified, and determined the crystal structure of the A. thaliana  LpxA ortholog (AtLpxA) to 2.1 A resolution. The overall structure of AtLpxA is  very similar to that of E. coli LpxA (EcLpxA) with an alpha-helical-rich C-terminus  and characteristic N-terminal left-handed parallel beta-helix (LbetaH). All key  catalytic and chain length-determining residues of EcLpxA are conserved in  AtLpxA; however, AtLpxA has an additional coil and loop added to the LbetaH not seen  in EcLpxA. Consistent with the similarities between the two structures, purified  AtLpxA catalyzes the same reaction as EcLpxA. In addition, A. thaliana lpxA  complements an E. coli mutant lacking the chromosomal lpxA and promotes the  synthesis of lipid A in vivo similar to the lipid A produced in the presence of  E. coli lpxA. This work shows that AtLpxA is a functional UDP-GlcNAc  acyltransferase that is able to catalyze the same reaction as EcLpxA and supports  the hypothesis that lipid A molecules are biosynthesized in Arabidopsis and other  plants.', '2012 May 29', 'Biochemistry', '10.1021/bi3002242', 'Garrett']
