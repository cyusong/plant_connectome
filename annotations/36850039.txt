Metallochaperones are a unique class of proteins that play crucial roles in metal homoeostasis and detoxification. However, few metallochaperones have been functionally characterised in rice. Heterologous expression of Heavy metal-associated Isoprenylated Plant Protein 9 (OsHIPP9), a metallochaperone, altered yeast tolerance to cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu). We investigated the physiological role of OsHIPP9 in rice. OsHIPP9 was primarily expressed in the root exodermis and xylem region of enlarged vascular bundles (EVB) at nodes. KO of OsHIPP9 increased the Cd concentrations of the upper nodes and panicle, but decreased Cd in expanded leaves. KO of OsHIPP9 decreased Cu uptake and accumulation in rice. Constitutive OX of OsHIPP9 increased Cd and Cu accumulation in aboveground tissues and brown rice. OsHIPP9 showed binding capacity for Cd and Cu. We propose that OsHIPP9 has dual metallochaperone roles, chelating Cd in the xylem region of EVB for Cd retention in the nodes and chelating Cu in rice roots to aid Cu uptake.
