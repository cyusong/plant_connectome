Arabidopsis thaliana contains 13 fibrillins (FBNs), which are all localized to chloroplasts. FBN1 and FBN2 are involved in photoprotection of photosystem II, and FBN4 and FBN5 are thought to be involved in plastoquinone transport and biosynthesis, respectively. The functions of the other FBNs remain largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of FBN6, we performed coexpression and Western analyses, conducted fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, stained reactive oxygen species (ROS), measured photosynthetic parameters and glutathione levels, and applied transcriptomics and metabolomics. Using coexpression analyses, FBN6 was identified as a photosynthesis-associated gene. FBN6 is localized to thylakoid and envelope membranes, and its knockout results in stunted plants. The delayed-growth phenotype cannot be attributed to altered basic photosynthesis parameters or a reduced CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate. Under moderate light stress, primary leaves of fbn6 plants begin to bleach and contain enlarged plastoglobules. RNA sequencing and metabolomics analyses point to an alteration in sulfate reduction in fbn6. Indeed, glutathione content is higher in fbn6, which in turn confers cadmium tolerance of fbn6 seedlings. We conclude that loss of FBN6 leads to perturbation of ROS homeostasis. FBN6 enables plants to cope with moderate light stress and affects cadmium tolerance.
