['36432778', 'Plant cell wall remodeling is an important process during plant responses to heat  stress. Pectins, a group of cell wall polysaccharides with a great diversity of  complex chemical structures, are also involved in heat stress responses.  Enzymatic activity of the pectin methyl esterases, which remove methyl groups  from pectins in the cell wall, is regulated by DUF642 proteins, as described in  different plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. Our results  demonstrated that heat stress altered the expression of the DUF642 gene, BIIDXI.  There was an important decrease in BIIDXI expression during the first hour of HS,  followed by an increase at 24 h. bdx-1 seedlings had less tolerance to heat  stress but presented a normal heat stress response; HSFA2 and HSP22 expressions  were highly increased, as they were in WT seedlings. Thermopriming triggered  changes in pectin methyl esterase activity in WT seedlings, while no increases in  PME activity were detected in bdx-1 seedlings at the same conditions. Taken  together, our results suggest that BIIDXI is involved in thermotolerance via PME  activation.', '2022 Nov 11', 'Plants (Basel)', '10.3390/plants11223049', 'ORCID:']
