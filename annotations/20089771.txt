['20089771', 'Light is the ultimate source of energy for photosynthesis; however, excessive  light leads to photooxidative damage and hence reduced photosynthetic efficiency,  especially when combined with other abiotic stresses. Although the photosystem II  (PSII) reaction center D1 protein is the primary target of photooxidative damage,  other PSII core proteins are also damaged and degraded. However, it is still  largely unknown whether degradation of D1 and other PSII proteins involves  previously uncharacterized proteases. Here, we show that Deg7 is peripherally  associated with the stromal side of the thylakoid membranes and that Deg7  interacts directly with PSII. Our results show that Deg7 is involved in the  primary cleavage of photodamaged D1, D2, CP47, and CP43 and that this activity is  essential for its function in PSII repair. The double mutants deg5 deg7 and deg8  deg7 showed no obvious phenotypic differences under normal growth conditions, but  additive effects were observed under high light. These results suggest that Deg  proteases on both the stromal and luminal sides of the thylakoid membranes are  important for the efficient PSII repair in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).', '2010 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.150722', 'Zhang']
