Cuticular wax is closely related to plant resistance to abiotic stress. 3-Ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) catalyzes the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) wax precursors. In this study, a novel <i>KCS</i> family gene was isolated from Newhall navel orange and subsequently named <i>CsKCS6</i>. The CsKCS6 protein has two main domains that belong to the thiolase-like superfamily, the FAE1-CUT1-RppA and ACP_syn_III_C domains, which exist at amino acid positions 80-368 and 384-466, respectively. <i>CsKCS6</i> was expressed in all tissues, with the highest expression detected in the stigma; in addition, the transcription of <i>CsKCS6</i> was changed in response to drought stress, salt stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Heterologous expression of <i>CsKCS6</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> significantly increased the amount of VLCFAs in the cuticular wax on the stems and leaves, but there were no significant changes in total wax content. Compared with that of the wild-type (WT) plants, the leaf permeability of the transgenic plants was lower. Further research showed that, compared with the WT plants, the transgenic lines experienced less water loss and ion leakage after dehydration stress, displayed increased survival under drought stress treatment and presented significantly longer root lengths and survival under salt stress treatment. Our results indicate that <i>CsKCS6</i> not only plays an important role in the synthesis of fatty acid precursors involved in wax synthesis but also enhances the tolerance of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants to abiotic stress. Thus, the identification of <i>CsKSC6</i> could help to increase the abiotic stress tolerance of <i>Citrus</i> in future breeding programs.
