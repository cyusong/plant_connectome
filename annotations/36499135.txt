Stomata are specialized portals in plant leaves to modulate water loss from plants to the atmosphere by control of the transpiration, thereby determining the water-use efficiency and drought resistance of plants. Despite that the stomata developmental progression is well-understood at the molecular level, the experimental evidence that miRNA regulates stomata development is still lacking, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study demonstrates the involvement of stu-miR827 in regulating the drought tolerance of potato due to its control over the leaf stomatal density. The expression analysis showed that stu-miR827 was obviously repressed by drought stresses and then rapidly increased after rewatering. Suppressing the expression of stu-miR827 transgenic potato lines showed an increase in stomatal density, correlating with a weaker drought resistance compared with wildtype potato lines. In addition, <i>StWRKY48</i> was identified as the target gene of stu-miR827, and the expression of <i>StWRKY48</i> was obviously induced by drought stresses and was greatly upregulated in stu-miR827 knockdown transgenic potato lines, suggesting its involvement in the drought stress response. Importantly, the expression of genes associated with stomata development, such as <i>SDD</i> (stomatal density and distribution) and <i>TMM</i> (too many mouths), was seriously suppressed in transgenic lines. Altogether, these observations demonstrated that suppression of stu-miR827 might lead to overexpression of <i>StWRKY48</i>, which may contribute to negatively regulating the drought adaptation of potato by increasing the stomatal density. The results may facilitate functional studies of miRNAs in the process of drought tolerance in plants.
