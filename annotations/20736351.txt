['20736351', 'The growth of an organism and its size determination require the tight regulation  of cell proliferation and cell growth. However, the mechanisms and regulatory  networks that control and integrate these processes remain poorly understood.  Here, we address the biological role of Arabidopsis translationally controlled  tumor protein (AtTCTP) and test its shared functions in animals and plants. The  data support a role of plant AtTCTP as a positive regulator of mitotic growth by  specifically controlling the duration of the cell cycle. We show that, in  contrast to animal TCTP, plant AtTCTP is not implicated in regulating postmitotic  growth. Consistent with this finding, plant AtTCTP can fully rescue cell  proliferation defects in Drosophila loss of function for dTCTP. Furthermore,  Drosophila dTCTP is able to fully rescue cell proliferation defects in  Arabidopsis tctp knockouts. Our data provide evidence that TCTP function in  regulating cell division is part of a conserved growth regulatory pathway shared  between plants and animals. The study also suggests that, although the cell  division machinery is shared in all multicellular organisms to control growth,  cell expansion can be uncoupled from cell division in plants but not in animals.', '2010 Sep 14', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1007926107', 'Bendahmane']
