Since its first formulation almost 50 years ago, acid growth has had a chequered past complicated by utilization of diverse species and organs for testing alongside necessary but coarse methodology. Within the past 25 years, we have gained new insights into the molecular mechanisms behind the transduction of the signal auxin into the reality of an apoplastic pH shift as well as the effect on cell wall mechanics and the biochemical players within the wall contributing to the resultant growth. In this review, we begin by discussing the historical work and its complications, move on to the modern work and its addition to acid growth, which we finally summarize in an updated model which includes new postulations and questions.
