Resurrection plants differ from other species in their unique ability to survive desiccation. In order to understand the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance, proteome studies were carried out using leaves of the resurrection plant Boea hygrometrica to reveal proteins that were differentially expressed in response to changes in relative water content. This opportunity was afforded by the rare ability of excised B. hygrometrica leaves to survive and resume metabolism following desiccation in a manner similar to intact plants. From a total of 223 proteins that were reproducibly detected and analyzed, 35% showed increased abundance in dehydrated leaves, 5% were induced in rehydrated leaves and 60% showed decreased or unchanged abundance in dehydrated and rehydrated leaves. Since the induction kinetics fall into clearly defined patterns, we suggest that programmed regulation of protein expression triggered by changes of water status. Fourteen dehydration responsive proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Eight proteins were classified as playing a role in reactive oxygen species scavenging, photosynthesis and energy metabolism. In agreement with these findings, glutathione content and polyphenol oxidase activity were found to increase upon dehydration and rapid recovery of photosynthesis was observed.
