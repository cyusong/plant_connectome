['36419364', 'Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are conserved splicing regulators that play  important roles in plant stress responses, namely those mediated by the abscisic  acid (ABA) hormone. The Arabidopsis thaliana SR-like protein SR45 is a described  negative regulator of the ABA pathway during early seedling development. How the  inhibition of growth by ABA signaling is counteracted to maintain plant  development under stress conditions remains largely unknown. Here, we show that  SR45 overexpression reduces Arabidopsis sensitivity to ABA during early seedling  development. Biochemical and confocal microscopy analyses of transgenic plants  expressing fluorescently tagged SR45 revealed that exposure to ABA  dephosphorylates the protein at multiple amino acid residues and leads to its  accumulation, due to SR45 stabilization via reduced ubiquitination and  proteasomal degradation. Using phosphomutant and phosphomimetic transgenic  Arabidopsis lines, we demonstrate the functional relevance of ABA-mediated  dephosphorylation of a single SR45 residue, T264, in antagonizing SR45  ubiquitination and degradation to promote its function as a repressor of seedling  ABA sensitivity. Our results reveal a mechanism that negatively autoregulates ABA  signaling and allows early plant growth under stress via posttranslational  control of the SR45 splicing factor.', '2023 Mar 13', 'Plant Commun', '10.1016/j.xplc.2022.100495', 'Duque']
