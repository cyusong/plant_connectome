['26203655', 'Stomata, valves on the plant epidermis, are critical for plant growth and  survival, and the presence of stomata impacts the global water and carbon cycle.  Although transcription factors and cell-cell signaling components regulating  stomatal development have been identified, it remains unclear as to how their  regulatory interactions are translated into two-dimensional patterns of stomatal  initial cells. Using molecular genetics, imaging, and mathematical simulation, we  report a regulatory circuit that initiates the stomatal cell-lineage. The circuit  includes a positive feedback loop constituting self-activation of SCREAMs that  requires SPEECHLESS. This transcription factor module directly binds to the  promoters and activates a secreted signal, EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR2, and the  receptor modifier TOO MANY MOUTHS, while the receptor ERECTA lies outside of this  module. This in turn inhibits SPCH, and hence SCRMs, thus constituting a negative  feedback loop. Our mathematical model accurately predicts all known stomatal  phenotypes with the inclusion of two additional components to the circuit: an  EPF2-independent negative-feedback loop and a signal that lies outside of the  SPCH*SCRM module. Our work reveals the intricate molecular framework governing  self-organizing two-dimensional patterning in the plant epidermis.', '2015 Jul', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1005374', 'Torii']
