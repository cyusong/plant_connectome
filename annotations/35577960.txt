Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) is a phloem-feeding global agricultural pest belonging to the order Hemiptera. Foliar application of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) represents an attractive avenue for pest control; however, limited uptake and phloem availability of the dsRNA has restricted the development of RNA interference (RNAi)-based biopesticides against sap-sucking insects. Following high-throughput single and combinational target gene identification for additive effects, we report here that foliar application of dsRNA loaded onto layered double hydroxide (LDH), termed BioClay, can effectively disrupt multiple whitefly developmental stages in planta. Adjuvants were shown to enhance uptake and movement of foliar-applied dsRNA to vascular bundles and into the whitefly. Notably, delivering the dsRNA as a BioClay spray instead of as naked dsRNA improved protection against immature insect stages, demonstrating the platform's potential to extend the benefits offered by RNA insecticides towards complete life cycle control of whitefly and potentially other pests.
