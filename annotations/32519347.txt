Seed longevity is a polygenic trait of relevance for agriculture and for understanding the effect of environment on the ageing of biological systems. In order to identify novel longevity genes, we have phenotyped the natural variation of 270 ecotypes of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, for natural ageing and for three accelerated ageing methods. Genome-wide analysis, using publicly available single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data sets, identified multiple genomic regions associated with variation in seed longevity. Reverse genetics of 20 candidate genes in Columbia ecotype resulted in seven genes positive for seed longevity (PSAD1, SSLEA, SSTPR, DHAR1, CYP86A8, MYB47 and SPCH) and five negative ones (RBOHD, RBOHE, RBOHF, KNAT7 and SEP3). In this uniform genetic background, natural and accelerated ageing methods provided similar results for seed-longevity in knock-out mutants. The NADPH oxidases (RBOHs), the dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR1) and the photosystem I subunit (PSAD1) highlight the important role of oxidative stress on seed ageing. The cytochrome P-450 hydroxylase, CYP86A8, and the transcription factors, MYB47, KNAT7 and SEP3, support the protecting role of the seed coat during seed ageing.
