Plant cells maintain sophisticated gene transcription programs to regulate their development, communication, and response to the environment. Environmental stress cues, such as pathogen encounter, lead to dramatic reprogramming of transcription to favor stress responses over normal cellular functions. Transcription reprogramming is conferred by the concerted action of myriad transcription (co)factors that function directly or indirectly to recruit or release RNA Polymerase II. To establish an effective defense response, cells require transcription (co)factors to deploy their activity rapidly, transiently, spatially, and hierarchically. Recent findings suggest that in plant immunity these requirements are met by posttranslational modifications that accurately regulate transcription (co)factor activity as well as by sequential pulse activation of specific gene transcription programs that provide feedback and feedforward properties to the defense gene network. Here, we integrate these recent findings from plant defense studies into the emerging field of transcription dynamics in eukaryotes.

Environment: !triggers! Transcription Reprogramming
Transcription (co)factors: !recruit/release! RNA Polymerase II
Posttranslational modifications: !accurately regulate! Transcription (co)factor activity
Gene transcription programs: !provide feedback/feedforward! Defense gene network
