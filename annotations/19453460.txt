['19453460', 'Chloroplast division in plant cells is accomplished through the coordinated  action of the tubulin-like FtsZ ring inside the organelle and the dynamin-like  ARC5 ring outside the organelle. This coordination is facilitated by ARC6, an  inner envelope protein required for both assembly of FtsZ and recruitment of  ARC5. Recently, we showed that ARC6 specifies the mid-plastid positioning of the  outer envelope proteins PDV1 and PDV2, which have parallel functions in dynamin  recruitment. PDV2 positioning involves direct ARC6-PDV2 interaction, but PDV1 and  ARC6 do not interact indicating that an additional factor functions downstream of  ARC6 to position PDV1. Here, we show that PARC6 (paralog of ARC6), an ARC6-like  protein unique to vascular plants, fulfills this role. Like ARC6, PARC6 is an  inner envelope protein with its N-terminus exposed to the stroma and Arabidopsis  parc6 mutants exhibit defects of chloroplast and FtsZ filament morphology.  However, whereas ARC6 promotes FtsZ assembly, PARC6 appears to inhibit FtsZ  assembly, suggesting that ARC6 and PARC6 function as antagonistic regulators of  FtsZ dynamics. The FtsZ inhibitory activity of PARC6 may involve its interaction  with the FtsZ-positioning factor ARC3. A PARC6-GFP fusion protein localizes both  to the mid-plastid and to a single spot at one pole, reminiscent of the  localization of ARC3, PDV1 and ARC5. Although PARC6 localizes PDV1, it is not  required for PDV2 localization or ARC5 recruitment. Our findings indicate that  PARC6, like ARC6, plays a role in coordinating the internal and external  components of the chloroplast division complex, but that PARC6 has evolved  distinct functions in the division process.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03905.x', 'Osteryoung']
