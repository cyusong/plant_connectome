In Arabidopsis thaliana root meristems the GATA2 transcription factor is a marker for the root transition domain, is auxin regulated, and functions to restrict cell division activity. The growing part of roots is comprised of three discrete regions; the proliferative domain (PD), an elongation zone, and interposed between these two, the transition domain (TD), which is the focus of this investigation. Within the TD, it is hypothesized that cells are reprogrammed, losing the capacity to divide and begin to differentiate. In recently germinated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, a TD is not anatomically evident, but subsequently forms in a region of the root in which there has occurred prior expression of both AUX1/PIN2 proteins and of transcripts of the GATA transcription factor family (pGATA2:H2B-YFP or pGATA2:GUS). pGATA2:GUS expression is regulated by auxin and is reduced in seedlings in which either auxin transport or auxin sensitivity is perturbed. Application of cytokinin results in a reduction in both pGATA2:GUS expression and in TD cell number, via a pathway involving ARR1 and ARR12. Overexpression of GATA2 is accompanied by a reduction in cell number in the PD, but has no effect on cell number in the TD, whereas in knockdowns of GATA transcription factors, cell number is reduced in both the PD and TD. We conclude: (1) that GATA2 expression is localized to (a marker for) the TD; (2) that development and maintenance of the TD are associated with an auxin-regulation of GATA2 expression; (3) that GATA transcription factors function to restrict cell division activity.
