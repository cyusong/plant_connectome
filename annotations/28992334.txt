As an essential nutrient element, phosphorus (P) plays an important role in plant growth and development. Low P availability is a limiting factor for crop production, especially for legume crops (e.g. soybean), which require additional P to sustain nitrogen fixation through symbiotic associations with rhizobia. Although PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 (PHR1) or PHR1-like is considered as a central regulator of phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in several plant species, it remains undefined in soybean. In this study, 35 GmPHR members were cloned from the soybean genome and expression patterns in soybean were assayed under nitrogen (N) and P deficiency conditions. GmPHR25, which is up-regulated in response to Pi starvation, was then overexpressed in soybean hairy roots in vitro and in vivo to investigate its functions. The results showed that overexpressing GmPHR25 increased Pi concentration in transgenic soybean hairy roots under normal conditions, accompanied with a significant decrease in hairy root growth. Furthermore, transcripts of 11 out of 14 high-affinity Pi transporter (GmPT) members as well as five other Pi starvation-responsive genes were significantly increased in soybean hairy roots with GmPHR25 overexpression. Taken together, this study suggests that GmPHR25 is a vital regulator in the P signaling network, and controls Pi homeostasis in soybean.
