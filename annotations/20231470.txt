['20231470', 'The development of anther and pollen is important for male reproduction, and this  process is coordinately regulated by many external and internal cues. In this  study, we systematically examined the male reproductive phenotypes of a series of  brassinosteroid biosynthetic and signaling mutants and found that, besides the  expected cell-expansion defects, these mutants also showed reduced pollen number,  viability, and release efficiency. These defects were related with abnormal  tapetum and microspore development. Using both real-time quantitative RT-PCR and  microarray experiments, we found that the expression of many key genes required  for anther and pollen development was suppressed in these mutants. ChIP analysis  demonstrated that BES1, an important transcription factor for brassinosteroid  signaling, could directly bind to the promoter regions of genes encoding  transcription factors essential for anther and pollen development, SPL/NZZ, TDF1,  AMS, MS1, and MS2. Taken together, these data lead us to propose that  brassinosteroids control male fertility at least in part via directly regulating  key genes for anther and pollen development in Arabidopsis. Our work provides a  unique mechanism to explain how a phytohormone regulates an essential genetic  program for plant development.', '2010 Mar 30', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0912333107', 'Wang']
