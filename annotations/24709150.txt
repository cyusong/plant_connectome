The plant vacuole constitutes a large transient storage compartment for nutrients, proteins and metabolites, and is a major cellular sink for toxic waste compounds. Amino acids can cross the vacuolar membrane via specific transport proteins, which are molecularly not well characterized. Two members of a small subfamily of the cationic amino acid transporters, AtCAT2 and AtCAT4, were primarily localized at the tonoplast when tagged with GFP. The closely related AtCAT3, by contrast, was detected in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The exchange of a di-acidic motif at the carboxy-tail affected their sub-cellular localization, with larger effects visible in transiently transformed protoplasts compared to stably expressing plant lines. The genes have broad, partially overlapping tissue expression, with CAT2 dominating in most tissues. Loss-of-function mutants of individual CATs showed no visible phenotype under various conditions, but the overall tissue concentration of amino acids was increased in soil-grown cat2 mutants. The data suggest that CAT2 is a critical target of leaf amino acid concentrations and manipulation of this tonoplast transporter can significantly alter total tissue amino acid concentrations.
