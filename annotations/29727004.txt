Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) together constitute approximately 80% of chloroplast lipids. Apart from facilitating the photosynthesis light reaction in the thylakoid membrane, these two lipids are important for maintaining chloroplast morphology and for plant survival under abiotic stresses such as phosphate starvation and freezing. Recently it was shown that severe growth retardation phenotypes of the DGDG-deficient mutant dgd1 were due to jasmonate overproduction, linking MGDG and DGDG homeostasis with phytohormone production and suggesting MGDG as a major substrate for jasmonate biosynthesis. Induction of jasmonate synthesis and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling was also observed under conditions of phosphate starvation. We hypothesize that when DGDG is recruited to substitute for phospholipids in extraplastidic membranes during phosphate deficiency, the altered MGDG to DGDG ratio in the chloroplast envelope triggers the conversion of galactolipids into jasmonates. The conversion may contribute to rebalancing the MGDG to DGDG ratio rapidly to maintain chloroplast shape, and jasmonate production can reduce the growth rate and enhance predator deterrence. We also hypothesize that other conditions, such as suppression of dgd1 phenotypes by trigalactosyldiacylglycerol (tgd) mutations, may all be linked to altered jasmonate production, indicating that caution should be exercised when interpreting phenotypes caused by conditions that may alter the MGDG to DGDG ratio at the chloroplast envelope.
