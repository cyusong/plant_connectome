Blueberry is one of the most important fruit crops worldwide. Anthocyanin is an important secondary metabolites that affects the appearance and nutritive quality of blueberries. However, few studies have focused on the molecular mechanism underlying anthocyanin accumulation induced by light intensity in blueberries. The metabolic analysis revealed that there were 134 significantly changed metabolites in the natural light compared to the control, and flavone, flavonol, and anthocyanins were the most significantly increased. Transcriptome analysis found 6 candidate genes for the anthocyanin synthesis pathway. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) results confirmed changes in the expression levels of genes encoding metabolites involved in the flavonoid synthesis pathways. The flavonoid metabolic flux in the light intensity-treatment increased the accumulation of delphinidin-3-O-arabinoside compared to under the shading-treatment. Furthermore, we performed qRT-PCR analysis of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes and predicted that the gene of VcF3'5'H4 may be a candidate gene for anthocyanin accumulation and is highly expressed in light intensity-treated fruit. Through the co-expression analysis of transcription factors and anthocyanin synthesis pathway genes, we found that the VcbHLH004 gene may regulate VcF3'5'H4, and then we transformed VcbHLH004 heterologously into tomato to verify its function. These results provide novel insights into light intensity regulation of blueberry anthocyanin accumulation and represent a valuable data set to guide future functional studies and blueberry breeding.
