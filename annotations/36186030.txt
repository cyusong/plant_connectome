The NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase-encoded gene <i>GH_D13G1452</i> with a C-terminus tripeptide Proline-Lysine-Leucine was localized in the peroxisome. It was highly expressed in stems and ovules of 15 days post-anthesis and responded to multiple external stimuli in upland cotton. An upland cotton mutant (<i>Ghpericdh</i>) was identified by flanking sequence amplification and genome variation detection that exogenous sequence was inserted in the middle of the 12th intron of <i>GH_D13G1452</i>, resulting in the deficiency of gene expression. The <i>Ghpericdh</i> mutant displayed a dwarf plant phenotype when grown under field or greenhouse conditions, and <i>GH_D13G1452</i> functioned as an incomplete dominance on plant height. The germination rate of mutant seed from greenhouse-grown plants was dramatically lower than that from field-grown plants, which indicated that GhperICDH plays a critical role in seed maturation and germination. Therefore, <i>GH_D13G1452</i> is indispensable in the development of stems and seeds and functions in the adaptability of cotton to the environment. The <i>Ghpericdh</i> mutant provides insight into the function of peroxisomal ICDH and may contribute to the genetic improvement in cotton.
