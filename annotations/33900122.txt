The soybean cyst nematode <i>Heterodera glycines</i> is the most economically devastating pathogen of soybean in the United States and threatens to become even more damaging through the selection of virulent nematode populations in the field that can overcome natural resistance mechanisms in soybean cultivars. This pathogen, therefore, demands intense transcriptomic/genomic research inquiries into the biology of its parasitic mechanisms. <i>H. glycines</i> delivers effector proteins that are produced in specialized gland cells into the soybean root to enable infection. The study of effector proteins, thus, is particularly promising when exploring novel management options against this pathogen. Here, we announce the availability of a gland cell-specific RNA-seq resource. These data represent an expression snapshot of gland cell activity during early soybean infection of a virulent and an avirulent <i>H. glycines</i> population, providing a unique and highly valuable resource for scientists examining effector biology and nematode virulence.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
