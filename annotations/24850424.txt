Ecological evidence indicates a worldwide trend of dramatically decreased soil Ca(2+) levels caused by increased acid deposition and massive timber harvesting. Little is known about the genetic and cellular mechanism of plants' responses to Ca(2+) depletion. In this study, transcriptional profiling analysis helped identify multiple extracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+) ]ext ) depletion-responsive genes in Arabidopsis thaliana L., many of which are involved in response to other environmental stresses. Interestingly, a group of genes encoding putative cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+) ]cyt ) sensors were significantly upregulated, implying that [Ca(2+) ]cyt has a role in sensing [Ca(2+) ]ext depletion. Consistent with this observation, [Ca(2+) ]ext depletion stimulated a transient rise in [Ca(2+) ]cyt that was negatively influenced by [K(+) ]ext , suggesting the involvement of a membrane potential-sensitive component. The [Ca(2+) ]cyt response to [Ca(2+) ]ext depletion was significantly desensitized after the initial treatment, which is typical of a receptor-mediated signaling event. The response was insensitive to an animal Ca(2+) sensor antagonist, but was suppressed by neomycin, an inhibitor of phospholipase C. Gd(3+) , an inhibitor of Ca(2+) channels, suppressed the [Ca(2+) ]ext -triggered rise in [Ca(2+) ]cyt and downstream changes in gene expression. Taken together, this study demonstrates that [Ca(2+) ]cyt plays an important role in the putative receptor-mediated cellular and transcriptional response to [Ca(2+) ]ext depletion of plant cells.
