The key parameters of photosynthetic capacity (maximum carboxylation rate (V(cmax)), electron transport capacity (J(max)) and dark respiration rate (R(d))) and the slope (m) of the stomatal conductance model of Ball et al. [Progress in photosynthetic research, Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1987] were measured for a whole growing season in fully expanded leaves of 12-year-old mango trees cv. Cogshall in La Réunion island. Leaf nitrogen partitioning into carboxylation (P(c)) and bioenergetic (P(b)) pools were computed according to the model of Niinemets and Tenhunen [Plant Cell Environ 1997;20: 845-66]. V(cmax), J(max), R(d), P(c) and P(b) remained relatively stable over the whole study period, with the exception of the period of linear fruit growth when J(max), R(d) and P(b) were slightly lower, and leaf non-structural carbohydrate content higher. During the pre-floral and floral periods, m decreased by more than 50%, indicating an increase in photosynthetic water use efficiency and m increased again during the period of linear fruit growth. Our results show that, in tropical orchard conditions characterized by mild seasonal climatic changes and non-limiting water supply, leaf nitrogen partitioning is rather stable. Our results also advocate for more studies on the effect of phenology on m and photosynthetic water use efficiency, which is of paramount importance for building coupled biochemical models of photosynthetic carbon assimilation.

V(cmax): !remains stable! over study period
J(max), R(d), P(b): !slightly lower! during linear fruit growth
m: !decreases by more than 50%! during pre-floral and floral periods
m: !increases again! during period of linear fruit growth
Leaf nitrogen partitioning: !rather stable! in tropical orchard conditions
