The basal resistance of barley to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei) is a quantitatively inherited trait that is based on nonhypersensitive mechanisms of defense. A functional genomic approach indicates that many plant candidate genes are involved in the defense against formation of fungal haustoria. It is not known which of these candidate genes have allelic variation that contributes to the natural variation in powdery mildew resistance, because many of them may be highly conserved within the barley species and may act downstream of the basal resistance reaction. Twenty-two expressed sequence tag or cDNA clone sequences that are likely to play a role in the barley-Blumeria interaction based on transcriptional profiling, gene silencing, or overexpression data, as well as mlo, Ror1, and Ror2, were mapped and considered candidate genes for contribution to basal resistance. We mapped the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for powdery mildew resistance in six mapping populations of barley at seedling and adult plant stages and developed an improved high-density integrated genetic map containing 6,990 markers for comparing QTL and candidate gene positions over mapping populations. We mapped 12 QTL at seedling stage and 13 QTL at adult plant stage, of which four were in common between the two developmental stages. Six of the candidate genes showed coincidence in their map positions with the QTL identified for basal resistance to powdery mildew. This co-localization justifies giving priority to those six candidate genes to validate them as being responsible for the phenotypic effects of the QTL for basal resistance.
