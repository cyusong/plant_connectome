Belowground plant-plant interactions can affect the concentrations of leaf chemicals, but the mechanism is not clear. Here, we investigated the effects of intra- and interspecific root exudates on the growth and leaf chemical content of <i>Rumex obtusifolius</i>. Seedlings of <i>R. obtusifolius</i> were grown with exposure to root exudates collected from other <i>R. obtusifolius</i> plants or from <i>Trifolium repens, Festuca ovina</i>, or <i>Plantago asiatica</i> plants, and the total phenolic, condensed tannin, dry biomass, and chlorophyll contents of the leaves were examined. The root exudates from conspecific plants had no effect on the total phenolic, condensed tannin, and chlorophyll contents of the leaves but did significantly reduce the dry leaf biomass. Root exudates from heterospecific plants had different effects depending on the species. These results were different from the results of a previous study that examined the effects of direct plant-plant interaction in <i>R. obtusifolius</i>. Thus, indirect interaction via root exudates induces different effects in leaves from direct interaction.
