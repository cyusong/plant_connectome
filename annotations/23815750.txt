['23815750', 'BACKGROUND: Although a number of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like  kinase-encoding genes (LRR-RLKs) have been identified in plants, a functional  role has been determined for only a few. Recent studies have demonstrated that an  LRR-RLK, PXY/TDR, is important for the process of secondary vascular development.  Other studies have indicated that PXY/TDR is unlikely to be the sole LRR-RLK  involved in this complex process. RESULTS: In this study, in silico analyses led  to the identification of three Arabidopsis LRR-RLK genes (PXY-correlated; PXC1,  2, 3) with transcript accumulation profiles that correlated strongly with several  key regulators of vascular development, including PXY/TDR, HB-8, REV, and CLE41.  Expression profiling using qPCR and promoter:reporter lines indicated that all  three PXC genes are associated with the vasculature. One in particular, PXC1  (At2g36570), had a strong correlation with PXY/TDR. Shifting pxc1 mutants from  long-days to short-days showed that loss of the gene led to a dramatic reduction  in secondary wall formation in xylem fibers. Transcript analysis of mutants for a  variety of secondary cell wall-associated genes, including PXY/TDR indicated that  the pathways mediated by PXC1 connect with those mediated by the  TDIF-PXY/TDR-WOX4 system. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that the LRR-RLK, PXC1  is involved in secondary cell wall formation in xylem fibers. Whereas further  study is needed to identify the ligands and mode of action of the PXC1 protein,  it is clear from this work that similarly to the shoot apical meristem (SAM),  secondary vascular development requires contributions from a number of LRR-RLKs.', '2013 Jul 1', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/1471-2229-13-94', 'Zheng']
