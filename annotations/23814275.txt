Sclerotinia sclerotiorum can initially suppress host oxidative burst to aid infection establishment, but later promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as proliferation advances. Here, it was shown that the cellular redox status can be modulated by thiamine to protect Arabidopsis thaliana against Sclerotinia at the early stages of infection. The initial inhibition of host ROS generation by Sclerotinia-secreted oxalate could effectively be alleviated by thiamine. Thiamine pre-treatment and subsequent wild-type Sclerotinia invasion induced an increase of ascorbate peroxidase activity concomitant with decreased ascorbate/dehydroascorbate ratios, which led to the cellular transition towards oxidative status in infected tissues. Particularly, it was observed that wild-type Sclerotinia, but not oxalate-deficient A2 mutant, could suppress the activity of NADPH oxidase (NOX), which might be an important mechanism underlying the early inhibition of ROS burst. Nevertheless, thiamine pre-treatment followed by wild-type Sclerotinia infection promoted NOX-derived ROS accumulation. Further studies showed that cytosolic Ca(2+) and staurosporine-sensitive protein kinase(s) participated in thiamine-induced activation of NOX. Moreover, thiamine-induced tissue defence responses including callose/lignin deposition and stomatal closure were closely correlated with NOX-derived ROS generation. Additionally, studies with Brassica species indicated that the regulation of thiamine is largely conserved upon Sclerotinia infection. Collectively, it was concluded that thiamine reverses the initial reducing status through activating NOX-dependent ROS signalling to perturb the disease progress of Sclerotinia.
