Parasitic nematode worms infect a variety of crop plants worldwide. Roots infected by these worms start to look rather unsavory - with knot like tumors (galls) developing all over them. At the core of each gall, a worm matures and lays its eggs. Olmo et al. (2018) looked into the developmental reprogramming that leads to gall formation and found an Arabidopsis protein to be a necessary component in this process.

Arabidopsis protein: !represses! gall formation 
Parasitic nematode worms: !infect! crop plants 
Roots: !develop! knot-like tumors 
Worms: !mature in! galls 
Worms: !lay eggs in! galls
