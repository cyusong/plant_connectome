Significant spatial variability in NH4+, NO3- and H+ net fluxes was measured in roots of young seedlings of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) with ion-selective microelectrodes. Seedlings were grown with NH4+, NO3-, NH4NO3 or no nitrogen (N), and were measured in solutions containing one or both N ions, or no N in a full factorial design. Net NO3- and NH4+ uptake and H+ efflux were greater in Douglas-fir than lodgepole pine and in roots not exposed to N in pretreatment. In general, the rates of net NH4+ uptake were the same in the presence or absence of NO3-, and vice versa. The highest NO3- influx occurred 0-30 mm from the root apex in Douglas-fir and 0-10 mm from the apex in lodgepole pine. Net NH4+ flux was zero or negative (efflux) at Douglas-fir root tips, and the highest NH4+ influx occurred 5-20 mm from the root tip. Lodgepole pine had some NH4+ influx at the root tips, and the maximum net uptake 5 mm from the root tip. Net H+ efflux was greatest in the first 10 mm of roots of both species. This study demonstrates that nutrient uptake by conifer roots can vary significantly across different regions of the root, and indicates that ion flux profiles along the roots may be influenced by rates of root growth and maturation.
