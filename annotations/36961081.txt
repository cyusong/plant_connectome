Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins play important roles in the acclimation of plants to environmental stress. Lysine acetylation is a dynamic and reversible PTM, which can be removed by histone deacetylases. Here we investigated the role of lysine acetylation in the response of Arabidopsis leaves to one week of salt stress. A quantitative mass spectrometry analysis revealed an increase in lysine acetylation of several proteins from cytosol and plastids, which was accompanied by altered histone deacetylase activities in the salt-treated leaves. While activities of HDA14 and HDA15 were decreased upon salt stress, HDA5 showed a mild and HDA19 a strongly increased activity. Since HDA5 is a cytosolic-nuclear enzyme from the class II histone deacetylase family with yet unknown protein substrates, we performed a lysine acetylome analysis on hda5 mutants and characterized its substrate proteins. Next to histone H2B, the salt stress responsive transcription factor GT2L and the dehydration-related protein ERD7 were identified as HDA5 substrates. In addition, in protein-protein interaction studies, HDA18 was discovered, among other interacting proteins, to work in a complex together with HDA5. Altogether this study revealed the substrate proteins of HDA5 and identified new lysine acetylation sites which are hyperacetylated upon salt stress. The identification of the specific histone deacetylase substrate proteins, apart from histones, will be important to unravel the acclimation response of Arabidopsis to salt stress and their role in plant physiology.
