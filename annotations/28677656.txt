Plant growth and development are critically influenced by unpredictable abiotic factors. To survive fluctuating changes in their environments, plants have had to develop robust adaptive mechanisms. The dynamic and complementary actions of the auxin and cytokinin pathways regulate a plethora of developmental processes, and their ability to crosstalk makes them ideal candidates for mediating stress-adaptation responses. Other crucial signaling molecules responsible for the tremendous plasticity observed in plant morphology and in response to abiotic stress are reactive oxygen species (ROS). Proper temporal and spatial distribution of ROS and hormone gradients is crucial for plant survival in response to unfavorable environments. In this regard, the convergence of ROS with phytohormone pathways acts as an integrator of external and developmental signals into systemic responses organized to adapt plants to their environments. Auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways have been studied extensively. Nevertheless, we do not yet understand the impact on plant stress tolerance of the sophisticated crosstalk between the two hormones. Here, we review current knowledge on the function of auxin and cytokinin in redirecting growth induced by abiotic stress in order to deduce their potential points of crosstalk.
