Cyclic electron transport around PSI has been proposed to supply the additional ATP required for C(4) photosynthesis. To investigate the nature of cyclic electron pathways involved in C(4) photosynthesis, we analyzed tissue-specific expression of PGR5 (PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5), which is involved in the antimycin A-sensitive pathway, and NDH-H, a subunit of the plastidial NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex, in four Flaveria species comprising NADP-malic enzyme (ME)-type C(4), C(3)-C(4) intermediate and C(3) species. PGR5 was highly expressed in the C(4) species and enriched in bundle sheath chloroplasts together with NDH-H, suggesting that electron transport of both PGR5-dependent and NDH-dependent cyclic pathways is promoted to drive C(4) photosynthesis.
