Genetic transformation of crop plants offers the possibility of testing hypotheses about the function of individual genes as well as the exploitation of transgenes for targeted trait improvement. However, in most cereals, this option has long been compromised by tedious and low-efficiency transformation protocols, as well as by the lack of versatile vector systems. After having adopted and further improved the protocols for Agrobacterium-mediated stable transformation of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), we now present a versatile set of binary vectors for transgene overexpression, as well as for gene silencing by double-stranded RNA interference. The vector set is offered with a series of functionally validated promoters and allows for rapid integration of the desired genes or gene fragments by GATEWAY-based recombination. Additional in-built flexibility lies in the choice of plant selectable markers, cassette orientation, and simple integration of further promoters to drive specific expression of genes of interest. Functionality of the cereal vector set has been demonstrated by transient as well as stable transformation experiments for transgene overexpression, as well as for targeted gene silencing in barley.
