Abscisic acid is a stress-related phytohormone that has roles in dehydration and rehydration. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), two genes that inactivate abscisic acid, CYP707A1 and CYP707A3, are rapidly up-regulated upon rehydration. The factors that regulate CYP707A1/3 are not well characterized. We expressed a bZIP protein, VIP1, as a green fluorescent protein fusion protein in Arabidopsis and found that the nuclear localization of VIP1 was enhanced within 10 min after rehydration. A yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that the amino-terminal region of VIP1 has transcriptional activation potential. In a transient reporter assay using Arabidopsis protoplasts, VIP1 enhanced the promoter activities of CYP707A1/3. In gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, VIP1 directly bound to DNA fragments of the CYP707A1/3 promoters. Transgenic plants expressing VIP1-green fluorescent protein were found to overexpress CYP707A1/3 mRNAs. The time course of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of VIP1 was consistent with the time courses of the expression of CYP707A1/3. These results suggest that VIP1 functions as a regulator of osmosensory signaling in Arabidopsis.
