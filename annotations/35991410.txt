Our study examined the mutation efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 method for tryptophan aminotransferase <i>BnaTAA1</i> genes involved in the auxin biosynthesis pathway. We made nine CRISPR/Cas9 constructs with various promoters driving the expression of a Cas9 from <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (SaCas9) or a plant-codon-optimized <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> Cas9 (pcoCas9). We developed a fast and efficient system for evaluating the variety and frequency of mutations caused by each construct using <i>Brassica napus</i> hairy roots. We showed that pcoCas9 is more efficient in mutating the targeted loci than SaCas9 and the presence of the NLS signal enhanced the chance of mutagenesis by 25%. The mutations were studied further in regenerated lines, and we determined the <i>BnaTAA1</i> gene expression and heritability of the gene modifications in transgenic plants. Hairy root transformation combined with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing represents a fast and straightforward system for studying target gene function in the important oilseed crop <i>B. napus</i>.
