Differentiation of stem cells in the plant apex gives rise to aerial tissues and organs. Presently, we lack a lineage map of the shoot apex cells in woody perennials - a crucial gap considering their role in determining primary and secondary growth. Here, we used single-nuclei RNA-sequencing to determine cell type-specific transcriptomes of the Populus vegetative shoot apex. We identified highly heterogeneous cell populations clustered into seven broad groups represented by 18 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters. Next, we established the developmental trajectories of the epidermis, leaf mesophyll and vascular tissue. Motivated by the high similarities between Populus and Arabidopsis cell population in the vegetative apex, we applied a pipeline for interspecific single-cell gene expression data integration. We contrasted the developmental trajectories of primary phloem and xylem formation in both species, establishing the first comparison of vascular development between a model annual herbaceous and a woody perennial plant species. Our results offer a valuable resource for investigating the principles underlying cell division and differentiation conserved between herbaceous and perennial species while also allowing us to examine species-specific differences at single-cell resolution.
