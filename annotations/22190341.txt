The circadian clock is an endogenous oscillator with a period of approximately 24 h that allows organisms to anticipate, and respond to, changes in the environment. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the circadian clock regulates a wide variety of physiological processes, including hypocotyl elongation and flowering time. CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) is a central clock component, and CCA1 overexpression causes circadian dysfunction, elongated hypocotyls, and late flowering. EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) modulates light input to the clock and is also postulated to be part of the clock mechanism. elf3 mutations cause light-dependent arrhythmicity, elongated hypocotyls, and early flowering. Although both genes affect similar processes, their relationship is not clear. Here, we show that CCA1 represses ELF3 by associating with its promoter, completing a CCA1-ELF3 negative feedback loop that places ELF3 within the oscillator. We also show that ELF3 acts downstream of CCA1, mediating the repression of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) and PIF5 in the control of hypocotyl elongation. In the regulation of flowering, our findings show that ELF3 and CCA1 either cooperate or act in parallel through the CONSTANS/FLOWERING LOCUS T pathway. In addition, we show that CCA1 represses GIGANTEA and SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS1 by direct interaction with their promoters, revealing additional connections between the circadian clock and the flowering pathways.
