Replicated multi-location yield trials are conducted every year in all regions throughout the world for all regionally important crops. Heritability, i.e., selection accuracy based on variety trials, improves with increased number of replicates. However, each replicate is associated with considerable cost. Therefore, it is important for crop variety trials to be optimally replicated. Based on the theory of quantitative genetics, functions that quantitatively define optimal replication on the single-trial basis and on multi-location trial basis were derived. The function on the single-trial basis often over-estimates the optimum number of replicates; it is the function on multi-location trial basis that is recommended for determining the optimal number of replicates. Applying the latter function to the yield data from the 2015-2019 Ottawa oat registration trials conducted both in Ontario and in other provinces of Canada led to the conclusion that a single replicate or two replicates would have sufficed under the current multi-location trial setup. This conclusion was empirically confirmed by comparing genotypic rankings based on all replicates with that on any two replicates. Use of two replicates can save 33-50% of field plots without affecting the selection efficacy.
