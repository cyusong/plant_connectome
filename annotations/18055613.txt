['18055613', 'Aerenchyma tissues form gas-conducting tubes that provide roots with oxygen under  hypoxic conditions. Although aerenchyma have received considerable attention in  Zea mays, the signaling events and genes controlling aerenchyma induction remain  elusive. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls form lysigenous  aerenchyma in response to hypoxia and that this process involves H(2)O(2) and  ethylene signaling. By studying Arabidopsis mutants that are deregulated for  excess light acclimation, cell death, and defense responses, we find that the  formation of lysigenous aerenchyma depends on the plant defense regulators LESION  SIMULATING DISEASE1 (LSD1), ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPIBILITY1 (EDS1), and  PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 (PAD4) that operate upstream of ethylene and reactive  oxygen species production. The obtained results indicate that programmed cell  death of lysigenous aerenchyma in hypocotyls occurs in a similar but independent  manner from the foliar programmed cell death. Thus, the induction of aerenchyma  is subject to a genetic and tissue-specific program. The data lead us to conclude  that the balanced activities of LSD1, EDS1, and PAD4 regulate lysigenous  aerenchyma formation in response to hypoxia.', '2007 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.048843', 'Karpinski']
