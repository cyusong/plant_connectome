['16166385', 'The transition from the juvenile to the mature phase during vegetative  development in plants is characterized by changes in leaf shape. We show that  GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E6 (GTE6) regulates differences in leaf  patterning between juvenile and mature leaves in Arabidopsis. GTE6 encodes a  novel small bromodomain-containing protein unique to plants. Mutations in GTE6  disrupt the formation of elliptical leaf laminae in mature leaves, whereas  overexpression of GTE6 resulted in elongated juvenile leaves. GTE6 positively  regulates the expression of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1), which encodes a myb-domain  protein that controls proximodistal patterning of leaves. Using chromatin  immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we show that GTE6 is associated with the  promoter and the start of the transcribed region of AS1 and up-regulates  expression of AS1 through acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Genetic studies  demonstrated that AS1 is epistatic to GTE6, indicating that GTE6 regulates AS1  during leaf morphogenesis. Chromatin remodeling at AS1 is a key regulatory  mechanism in leaf development, which ensures the continual production of mature  leaves following juvenile-adult transition, thereby maintaining the identity of  the mature vegetative phase.', '2005 Sep 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.352005', 'Gray']
