The MEKK1-MKK2-MPK4 cascade is activated during cold acclimation. However, little is known regarding the perception of low temperature. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of Arabidopsis with a membrane rigidifier, DMSO, caused MPK4 activation concomitantly with MEKK1 and MKK2 phosphorylation, as well as the cold-inducible gene COR15a expression. These processes are similar to the effects of cold treatment, whereas benzyl alcohol (BA), a membrane fluidizer, prevented such cold-induced events. Moreover, the DMSO-treated seedlings acquired freezing tolerance without cold acclimation. In contrast, the BA-pretreated seedlings did not show freezing tolerance. These results suggest that membrane rigidification activates this MAPK cascade and contributes to the acquisition of freezing tolerance.
