S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS) plays a crucial role in regulating stress responses. In a recent study, we found that overexpression of the cucumber gene <i>CsSAMS1</i> in tobacco can affect the production of polyamines and ethylene, as well as enhancing the salt stress tolerance of tobacco, but the exact underlying mechanisms are elusive. The calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) family is ubiquitous in plants and performs different biological functions in plant development and response to abiotic stress. We used a yeast two-hybrid system to detect whether the protein CDPK6 could interact with SAMS1 and verified their interaction by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. To further explore the function of cucumber <i>CDPK6</i>, we isolated and characterized <i>CsCDPK6</i> in cucumber. CsCDPK6 is a membrane protein that is highly expressed under various abiotic stresses, including salt stress. It was also observed that ectopic overexpression of <i>CsCDPK6</i> in tobacco enhanced salt tolerance. Under salt stress, <i>CsCDPK6</i>-overexpressing lines enhanced the survival rate and reduced stomatal apertures in comparison to wild-type (WT) lines, as well as lowering malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) contents and causing less relative electrolyte leakage. Moreover, repression of <i>CsCDPK6</i> expression by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in cucumber seedling cotyledons under salt stress increased ethylene production and promoted the transformation from putrescine (Put) to spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm). These findings shed light on the interaction of <i>CsSAMS1</i> and <i>CsCDPK6</i>, which functions positively to regulate salt stress in plants.
