In plants salt and water stress result in an induction of respiration and accumulation of stress-related metabolites (SRMs) with osmoregulation and osmoprotection functions that benefit photosynthesis. The synthesis of SRMs may depend on an active respiratory metabolism, which can be restricted under stress by the inhibition of the cytochrome oxidase pathway (COP), thus causing an increase in the reduction level of the ubiquinone pool. However, the activity of the alternative oxidase pathway (AOP) is thought to prevent this from occurring while at the same time, dissipates excess of reducing power from the chloroplast and thereby improves photosynthetic performance. The present research is based on the hypothesis that the accumulation of SRMs under osmotic stress will be affected by changes in folial AOP activity. To test this, the oxygen isotope-fractionation technique was used to study the <i>in vivo</i> respiratory activities of COP and AOP in leaves of wild-type <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants and of <i>aox1a</i> mutants under sudden acute stress conditions induced by mannitol and salt treatments. Levels of leaf primary metabolites and transcripts of respiratory-related proteins were also determined in parallel to photosynthetic analyses. The lack of <i>in vivo</i> AOP response in the <i>aox1a</i> mutants coincided with a lower leaf relative water content and a decreased accumulation of crucial osmoregulators. Additionally, levels of oxidative stress-related metabolites and transcripts encoding alternative respiratory components were increased. Coordinated changes in metabolite levels, respiratory activities and photosynthetic performance highlight the contribution of the AOP in providing flexibility to carbon metabolism for the accumulation of SRMs.
