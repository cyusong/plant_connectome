CG methylation (<sup>m</sup> CG) is essential for preserving genome stability in mammals, but this link remains obscure in plants. OsMET1-2, a major rice DNA methyltransferase, plays critical roles in maintaining <sup>m</sup> CG in rice. Null mutation of OsMET1-2 causes massive CG hypomethylation, rendering the mutant suitable to address the role of <sup>m</sup> CG in maintaining genome integrity in plants. Here, we analyzed <sup>m</sup> CG dynamics and genome stability in tissue cultures of OsMET1-2 homozygous (-/-) and heterozygous (+/-) mutants, and isogenic wild-type (WT). We found <sup>m</sup> CG levels in cultures of -/- were substantially lower than in those of WT and +/-, as expected. Unexpectedly, <sup>m</sup> CG levels in 1- and 3-year cultures of -/- were 77.6% and 48.7% higher, respectively, than in shoot, from which the cultures were initiated, suggesting substantial regain of <sup>m</sup> CG in -/- cultures, which contrasts to the general trend of <sup>m</sup> CG loss in all WT plant tissue cultures hitherto studied. Transpositional burst of diverse transposable elements (TEs) occurred only in -/- cultures, although no elevation of genome-wide mutation rate in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms was detected. Altogether, our results establish an essential role of <sup>m</sup> CG in retaining TE immobility and hence genome stability in rice and likely in plants in general.
