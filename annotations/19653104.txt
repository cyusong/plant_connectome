A grape-bud-oriented genomic platform was produced for a large-scale comparative analysis of bud responses to two stimuli of grape-bud dormancy release, hydrogen cyanamide (HC) and heat shock (HS). The results suggested considerable similarity in bud response to the stimuli, both in the repertoire of responding genes and in the temporary nature of the transcriptome reprogramming. Nevertheless, the bud response to HC was delayed, more condensed and stronger, as reflected by a higher number of regulated genes and a higher intensity of regulation compared to the response to HS. Integrating the changes occurring in response to both stimuli suggested perturbation of mitochondrial activity, development of oxidative stress and establishment of a situation that resembles hypoxia, which coincides with induction of glycolysis and fermentation, as well as changes in the interplay between ABA and ethylene metabolism. The latter is known to induce various growth responses in submerged plants and the possibility of a similar mechanism operating in the bud meristem during dormancy release is raised. The new link suggested between sub lethal stress, mitochondrial activity, hypoxic conditions, ethylene metabolism and cell enlargement during bud dormancy release may be instrumental in understanding the dormancy-release mechanism. Temporary increase of acetaldehyde, ethanol and ethylene in response to dormancy release stimuli demonstrated the predictive power of the working model, and its relevance to dormancy release was demonstrated by enhancement of bud break by exogenous ethylene and its inhibition by an ethylene signal inhibitor.
