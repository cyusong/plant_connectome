The functional and biochemical aspects of the photosynthetic apparatus in response to UV-B radiation were examined in unicellular oxygenic algae Scenedesmus obliquus. The wild type (Wt) and a chlorophyll b-less mutant (Wt-lhc) were used as a specific tool for the understanding of antenna role. Photosynthesis was monitored during and after UV-B stress by time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and polarography. Carotenoids, such as neoxanthin, loroxanthin, lutein, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, alpha- and beta-carotene, cellular and thylakoid-associated putrescine, spermidine, spermine and subcomplexes of light-harvesting complex (LHCII) of photosystem II (PSII) were investigated to assess their possible involvement in response to UV-B. Oxygen evolution depression by UV-B was higher in the Wt-lhc mutant than in the Wt. Photosynthesis recovery occurred in the Wt, but not in the mutant. The dissipation of excess excitation energy during UV-B stress was accompanied by changes in the thylakoid-associated polyamines which were much higher than changes in xanthophylls. We conclude that, at least in the unicellular green alga S. obliquus, mutants lacking chlorophyll b have significant lower capacity for recovery after UV-B stress. In addition, the comparison of xanthophylls and thylakoid-associated polyamines reveals that the latter are more responsive to UV-B stress and in a reversible manner.
