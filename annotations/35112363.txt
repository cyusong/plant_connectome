The recovery from photoinhibition is much slower in photosystem (PS) I than in PSII; therefore, the susceptibility of PSI to photoinhibition is important with respect to photosynthetic production under special physiological conditions. Previous studies have shown that repetitive short-pulse (rSP) illumination selectively induces PSI photoinhibition. Depending on the growth light intensity or the variety/species of the plant, PSI photoinhibition is different, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we aimed to clarify whether the differences in the susceptibility of PSI to photoinhibition depend on environmental factors or on rice varieties and which physiological properties of the plant are related to this susceptibility. We exposed mature leaves of rice plants to rSP illumination. We examined the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and low N during growth on the susceptibility of PSI to photoinhibition and compared it in 12 different varieties. We fitted the decrease in the quantum yield of PSI during rSP illumination and estimated a parameter indicating susceptibility. Low N level increased susceptibility, whereas elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration did not. The susceptibility differed among different rice varieties, and many indica varieties showed higher susceptibility than the temperate japonica varieties. Susceptibility was negatively correlated with the total chlorophyll content and N content. However, the decrease in <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mi>P</mi> <mi>m</mi> <mo>'</mo></msubsup> </math> value, an indicator of damaged PSI, was positively correlated with chlorophyll content. This suggests that in leaves with a larger electron transport capacity, the overall PSI activity may be less susceptible to photoinhibition, but more damaged PSI may accumulate during rSP illumination.
