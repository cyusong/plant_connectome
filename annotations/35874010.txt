Orphan genes (<i>OGs</i>) are defined as genes having no sequence similarity with genes present in other lineages. <i>OGs</i> have been regarded to play a key role in the development of lineage-specific adaptations and can also serve as a constant source of evolutionary novelty. These genes have often been found related to various stress responses, species-specific traits, special expression regulation, and also participate in primary substance metabolism. The advancement in sequencing tools and genome analysis methods has made the identification and characterization of <i>OGs</i> comparatively easier. In the study of <i>OG</i> functions in plants, significant progress has been made. We review recent advances in the fast evolving characteristics, expression modulation, and functional analysis of <i>OGs</i> with a focus on their role in plant biology. We also emphasize current challenges, adoptable strategies and discuss possible future directions of functional study of <i>OGs</i>.
