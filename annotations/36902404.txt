As a kind of plant-specific transcription factor (TF), DNA-Binding One Zinc Finger (Dof) is widely involved in the response to environmental change, and as an evolutionarily important perennial plant species, <i>Akebia trifoliata</i> is ideal for studying environmental adaptation. In this study, a total of 41 <i>AktDofs</i> were identified in the <i>A. trifoliata</i> genome. First, the characteristics, including the length, exon number, and chromosomal distribution of the <i>AktDofs</i> and the isoelectric point (PI), amino acid number, molecular weight (MW), and conserved motifs of their putative proteins, were reported. Second, we found that all <i>AktDofs</i> evolutionarily underwent strong purifying selection, and many (33, 80.5%) of them were generated by whole-genome duplication (WGD). Third, we outlined their expression profiles by the use of available transcriptomic data and RT-qPCR analysis. Finally, we identified four candidate genes (<i>AktDof21</i>, <i>AktDof20</i>, <i>AktDof36</i>, and <i>AktDof17</i>) and three other candidate genes (<i>AktDof26</i>, <i>AktDof16</i>, and <i>AktDof12</i>) that respond to long day (LD) and darkness, respectively, and that are closely associated with phytohormone-regulating pathways. Overall, this research is the first to identify and characterize the <i>AktDofs</i> family and is very helpful for further research on <i>A. trifoliata</i> adaptation to environmental factors, especially photoperiod changes.
