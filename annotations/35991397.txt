Alkaline stress severely limits plant growth and yield worldwide. NF-YC transcription factors (TFs) respond to abiotic stress by activating gene expression. However, the biological function of NF-YC TFs in alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.) is not clear. In our study, an <i>NF-YC2</i> gene was identified and transgenic plants were obtained by constructing overexpression vector and cotyledon node transformation system in alfalfa. The open reading frame of <i>MsNF-YC2</i> is 879 bp with 32.4 kDa molecular mass. <i>MsNF-YC2</i> showed tissue expression specificity and was induced by a variety of abiotic stresses including drought, salt, and alkali stress in alfalfa. Under alkali stress treatment, transgenic plants exhibited higher levels of antioxidant enzyme activities and proline (Pro), correlating with a lower levels of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup>) compared with wild-type (WT) plants. Transcriptomic results showed that overexpression of <i>MsNF-YC2</i> regulated the expression of phytohormone signal transduction and photosynthesis-related genes under normal and alkaline stress treatments. These results suggest that the <i>MsNF-YC2</i> gene plays crucial role enhance alkali adaptation abilities in alfalfa.
