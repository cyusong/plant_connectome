Zygospores form as a result of sexual reproduction between genetically determined mating type plus (mt<sup>+</sup> ) and mating type minus (mt<sup>-</sup> ) cells in heterothallic strains, or between clonal cells in homothallic strains. Here we review knowledge on the intercellular communication and mating type determination for successful sexual reproduction in Closterium. Using genomic information and transgenic techniques, the genus could be a model organism to study the mechanisms and evolution of sexual reproduction in streptophytes.
