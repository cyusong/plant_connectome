Brassinosteroids (BRs) are an important group of plant steroid hormones that regulate growth and development. Several members of the SMALL AUXIN UP RNA (SAUR) family have roles in BR-regulated hypocotyl elongation and root growth. However, the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we show in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that SAUR15 interacts with cell surface receptor-like kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) in BR-treated plants, resulting in enhanced BRI1 phosphorylation status and recruitment of the co-receptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1. Genetic and phenotypic assays indicated that the SAUR15 effect on BRI1 can be uncoupled from BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2 activity. Instead, we show that SAUR15 promotes BRI1 direct activation of plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PM H+-ATPase) via phosphorylation. Consequently, SAUR15-BRI1-PM H+-ATPase acts as a direct, PM-based mode of BR signaling that drives cell expansion to promote the growth and development of various organs. These data define an alternate mode of BR signaling in plants.
