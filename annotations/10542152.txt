['10542152', 'Phototropism of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings in response to a blue light source  is initiated by nonphototropic hypocotyl 1 (NPH1), a light-activated  serine-threonine protein kinase. Mutations in three loci [NPH2, root phototropism  2 (RPT2), and NPH3] disrupt early signaling occurring downstream of the NPH1  photoreceptor. The NPH3 gene, now cloned, encodes a NPH1-interacting protein.  NPH3 is a member of a large protein family, apparently specific to higher plants,  and may function as an adapter or scaffold protein to bring together the  enzymatic components of a NPH1-activated phosphorelay.', '1999 Oct 29', 'Science', '10.1126/science.286.5441.961', 'Liscum']
