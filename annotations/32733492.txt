Weeds burden plant growth as they compete for space, sunlight, and soil nutrients leading to 25-80% yield losses. Glyphosate [<i>N</i>-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] is a widely used broad spectrum non-selective herbicide that controls weeds by inhibiting 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme and interfering with the shikimate biosynthesis pathway. Cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L.) is one of the most important commercial crops grown worldwide for its fiber. We have developed herbicide tolerant transgenic cotton (cv. P8-6) by introgression of a codon-optimized and modified <i>EPSPS</i> gene (<i>CP4-EPSPS</i>) possessing an N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide from <i>Petunia hybrida</i>. Because of the recalcitrant nature of cotton, a genotype-independent non-tissue culture-based apical meristem-targeted <i>in planta</i> transformation approach was used to develop transformants. Although <i>in planta</i> transformation methodologies are advantageous in developing a large number of transgenic plants, effective screening strategies are essential for initial identification of transformants. In the present study, the use of a two-level rigorous screening strategy identified 2.27% of T1 generation plants as tolerant to 800 and 1,500 mg/L of commercially available glyphosate (Roundup). Precise molecular characterization revealed stable integration, expression, and inheritance of <i>CP4-EPSPS</i> in advanced generations of the promising transgenic events. Further, superiority of selected transgenic plants in tolerating increasing levels of glyphosate (500-4,000 mg/L) was ascertained through reduced accumulation of shikimate. This report is the first of its kind where cotton transformants tolerating high levels of glyphosate (up to 4,000 mg/L) and accumulating low levels of shikimate have been identified. This study not only reiterated the genotype-independent nature of the transformation strategy but also reiterated the translational utility of the <i>CP4-EPSPS</i> gene in management of weeds.
