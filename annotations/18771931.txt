['18771931', 'The Arabidopsis Enhancer of Shoot Regeneration 1 (ESR1) gene regulates initiation  of in vitro shoot regeneration. In this study, we investigated the  transcription-modulating potential of ESR1. ESR1 induced reporter gene expression  when overexpressed transiently in Arabidopsis leaf cells. Experiments using a  fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain located a transactivating domain  of ESR1 within the C-terminal region. A nuclear localization signal was also  located within the AP2/ERF domain. These results demonstrated that ESR1 functions  as a transcriptional activator. Furthermore, we examined whether transcriptional  modulation by ESR1 affects the in vitro shoot regeneration efficiency.  Overexpression of ESR1 fused with the VP16 transactivating domain enhanced in  vitro shoot regeneration as well as overexpressed wild-type ESR1 did, while  overexpression of ESR1 fused with a strong repression domain, SRDX, inhibited  shoot regeneration. These results suggest that ESR1 induces shoot regeneration  through its transactivating ability.', '2008 Dec', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2008.07.007', 'Banno']
