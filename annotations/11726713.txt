['11726713', 'Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT; EC 2.3.1.50) catalyzes the condensation of  serine with palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine in the first step of de novo  sphingolipid biosynthesis. In this study, we describe the cloning and functional  characterization of a cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana encoding the LCB2 subunit of  SPT. The Arabidopsis LCB2 (AtLCB2) cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1,467  nucleotides, encoding 489 amino acids. The predicted polypeptide contains three  transmembrane helices and a highly conserved motif involved in pyridoxal  phosphate binding. Expression of this open reading frame in the Saccharomyces  cerevisiae mutant strains defective in SPT activity resulted in the expression of  a significant level of sphinganine, suggesting that AtLCB2 cDNA encodes SPT.  Southern blot analysis and inspection of the complete Arabidopsis genome sequence  database suggest that there is a second LCB2-like gene in Arabidopsis. Expression  of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion product in suspension-cultured  tobacco BY-2 cells showed that AtLCB2 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum.  AtLCB2 cDNA may be used to study how sphingolipid synthesis is regulated in  higher plants.', '2001 Nov', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pce165', 'Imai']
