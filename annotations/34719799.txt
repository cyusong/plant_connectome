The temperature dependence of respiration rates and their acclimation to growth temperature vary among species/ecotypes, but the details remain unclear. Here, we compared the temperature dependence of shoot O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates among Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes to clarify how the temperature dependence and their acclimation to temperature differ among ecotypes, and how these differences relate to shoot growth. We examined growth analysis, temperature dependence of O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates, and protein amounts of the respiratory chain components in shoots of twelve ecotypes of A. thaliana grown at three different temperatures. The temperature dependence of the O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates were fitted to the modified Arrhenius model. The dynamic response of activation energy to measurement temperature was different among growth temperatures, suggesting that the plasticity of respiratory flux to temperatures differs among growth temperatures. The similar values of activation energy at growth temperature among ecotypes suggest that a similar process may determine the O<sub>2</sub> consumption rates at the growth temperature in any ecotype. These results suggest that the growth temperature affects not only the absolute rate of O<sub>2</sub> consumption but also the plasticity of respiratory flux in response to temperature, supporting the acclimation of shoot growth to various temperatures.
