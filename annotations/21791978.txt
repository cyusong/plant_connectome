Cells respond to nutrient stress by regulating gene transcription and various key metabolic processes, including ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. Several studies have shown that yeasts and mammalian cells also regulate export of tRNAs from the nucleus to the cytosol in response to nutrient stress. However, nuclear export of tRNA in mammalian cells during nutrient stress is controversial, as it has been recently shown that nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of tRNAs in several mammalian cell lines is not affected by nutrient deprivation. Furthermore, contrary to previous studies, data reported recently indicate that nuclear export of mature tRNAs derived from intron-containing precursor tRNAs, but not tRNAs made from intronless precursors, is affected by nutrient availability in several Saccharomyces species, although not in Kluyveromyces lactis and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here, we report that plants, like mammals and some yeasts, but unlike Saccharomyces, do not directly regulate nuclear export of tRNA in response to nutrient stress, indicating that this process is not entirely conserved among evolutionarily diverse organisms.
