Helicases are molecular motor proteins that perform a variety of cellular functions including transcription, translation, DNA replication and repair, RNA maturation, ribosome synthesis, nuclear export and splicing processes. The p68 is an evolutionarily conserved protein which plays pivotal roles in all aspect RNA metabolism processes. It is well established that helicases provides abiotic stress adaptation in plants but analysis of cis-regulatory elements present in the upstream regions is still infancy. Here we report isolation and functional characterization of the promoter of a DEAD-box helicase Psp68 in response to abiotic stress and hormonal regulation. The promoter of Psp68 was isolated by gene walking PCR from pea genomic DNA library constructed in BD genome walker kit. In silico analysis revealed that promoter of Psp68 contained a TATA, a CAAT motif and also harbors some important stress and hormone associated cis regulatory elements, including E-box, AGAAA, GATA-box, ACGT, GAAAA and GTCTC. Functional analyses were performed by Agrobacterium-mediated transient assay in tobacco leaves. Very high level of GUS activity was observed in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves by the construct carrying the Psp68 promoter::GUS, subjected to abiotic stress and exogenous hormonal treatments. Stress-inducible nature of Psp68 promoter opens possibility for the study of the gene regulation under stress condition. Therefore, may be useful in the field of agriculture and biotechnology.
