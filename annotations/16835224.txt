['16835224', 'We have isolated two cDNAs from Arabidopsis thaliana encoding bifunctional  3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/C-4 decarboxylases (3betaHSD/D) involved in  sterol synthesis, termed At3betaHSD/D1 and At3betaHSD/D2. Transformation of the  yeast ergosterol auxotroph erg26 mutant, which lacks 3betaHSD/D activity, with  the At3betaHSD/D1 isoform or with At3betaHSD/D2 isoform containing a C-terminal  At3betaHSD/D1 endoplasmic reticulum-retrieval sequence restored growth and  ergosterol synthesis in erg26. An in vitro enzymatic assay revealed high  3betaHSD/D activity for both isoenzymes in the corresponding microsomal extracts.  The two At3betaHSD/D isoenzymes showed similar substrate specificities that  required free 3beta-hydroxyl and C-4-carboxyl groups but were quite tolerant in  terms of variations of the sterol nucleus and side chain structures. Data  obtained with 4alpha-carboxy-cholest-7-en-3beta-ol and its 3alpha-deuterated  analog revealed that 3alpha-hydrogen-carbon bond cleavage is not the  rate-limiting step of the reaction. In planta reduction on the expression of the  3betaHSD/D gene as a consequence of VIGS-mediated gene silencing in Nicotiana  benthamiana led to a substantial accumulation of  3beta-hydroxy-4beta,14-dimethyl-5alpha-ergosta-9beta,19-cyclo-24(24(1))-en-4alpha-carboxylic  acid, consistent with a decrease in 3betaHSD/D activity. These two novel  oxidative decarboxylases constitute the first molecularly and functionally  characterized HSDs from a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family in plants.', '2006 Sep 15', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M604431200', 'Bard']
