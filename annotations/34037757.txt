Plant acclimation and stress responses depend on the dynamic optimization of carbon balance between source and sink organs. This optimization also applies to the leaf export rate of photosynthetically produced sugars. So far, investigations into the molecular mechanisms of how the rate is controlled have focused on sugar transporters responsible for loading sucrose into the phloem sieve element-companion cell complex of leaf veins. Here, we take a broader view of the various proteins with potential direct influence on the leaf sugar export rate in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, helped by the cell type-specific transcriptome data that have recently become available. Furthermore, we integrate current information on the regulation of these potential target proteins. Our analysis identifies putative control points and units of transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally co-regulated genes. Most notable is the potential regulatory unit of sucrose transporters (SUC2, SWEET11, SWEET12, and SUC4) and proton pumps (AHA3 and AVP1). Our analysis can guide future research aimed at understanding the regulatory network controlling leaf sugar export by providing starting points for characterizing regulatory strategies and identifying regulatory factors that link sugar export rate to the major signaling pathways.
