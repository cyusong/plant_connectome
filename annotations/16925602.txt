['16925602', "MADS-domain transcription factors are essential for proper flower and seed  development in angiosperms and their role in determination of floral organ  identity can be described by the 'ABC model' of flower development. Recently,  close relatives of the B-type genes were identified by phylogenetic studies,  which are referred to as B(sister) (B(s)) genes. Here, we report the isolation  and characterization of a MADS-box B(s) member from petunia, designated FBP24. An  fbp24 knock-down line appeared to closely resemble the Arabidopsis B(s) mutant  abs and a detailed and comparative analysis led to the conclusion that both FBP24  and ABS are necessary to determine the identity of the endothelial layer within  the ovule. Protein interaction studies revealed the formation of higher-order  complexes between B(s)-C-E and B(s)-D-E type MADS-box proteins, suggesting  involvement of these specific complexes in determination of endothelium identity.  However, although there are many similarities between the two genes and their  products and functions, interestingly FBP24 cannot replace ABS in Arabidopsis.  The results presented here demonstrate the importance of the comparative analysis  of key regulatory genes in various model systems to fully understand all aspects  of plant development.", '2006 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02846.x', 'Immink']
