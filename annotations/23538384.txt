['23538384', 'Nutrients shape the growth, maturation, and aging of plants and animals. In  plants, the juvenile to adult transition (vegetative phase change) is initiated  by a decrease in miR156. In Arabidopsis, we found that exogenous sugar decreased  the abundance of miR156, whereas reduced photosynthesis increased the level of  this miRNA. This effect was correlated with a change in the timing of vegetative  phase change, and was primarily attributable to a change in the expression of two  genes, MIR156A and MIR156C, which were found to play dominant roles in this  transition. The glucose-induced repression of miR156 was dependent on the  signaling activity of HEXOKINASE1. We also show that the defoliation-induced  increase in miR156 levels can be suppressed by exogenous glucose. These results  provide a molecular link between nutrient availability and developmental timing  in plants, and suggest that sugar is a component of the leaf signal that mediates  vegetative phase change.
