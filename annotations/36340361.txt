High doses of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) cause damage and cell death in plants. These two gases are among the most harmful air pollutants for ecosystems and therefore it is important to understand how plant resistance or sensitivity to these gases work at the molecular level and its genetic control. We compared transcriptome data from O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> fumigations to other cell death related treatments, as well as individual marker gene transcript level in different <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> accessions. Our analysis revealed that O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> trigger very similar gene expression responses that include genes involved in pathogen resistance, cell death and ethylene signaling. However, we also identified exceptions, for example <i>RBOHF</i> encoding a reactive oxygen species producing RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE PROTEIN F. This gene had increased transcript levels by O<sub>3</sub> but decreased transcript levels by NO<sub>2</sub>, showing that plants can identify each of the gases separately and activate distinct signaling pathways. To understand the genetics, we conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) on O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> tolerance of natural Arabidopsis accessions. Sensitivity to both gases seem to be controlled by several independent small effect loci and we did not find an overlap in the significantly associated regions. Further characterization of the GWAS candidate loci identified new regulators of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> induced cell death including ABH1, a protein that functions in abscisic acid signaling, mRNA splicing and miRNA processing. The GWAS results will facilitate further characterization of the control of programmed cell death and differences between oxidative and nitrosative stress in plants.
