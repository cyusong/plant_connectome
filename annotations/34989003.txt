Flowering in angiosperms is a crucial event that marks the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase. In many perennials, pruning is an important horticultural practice that induces synchronized and profuse flowering. In pomegranate, vegetative growth immediately after pruning is associated with activation of PgCENa, a flowering suppressor of the phosphatidyl ethanolamine binding protein (PEBP) family, while a reduction is associated with synchronous flowering. We show that flowering in pomegranate is activated by expression of another PEBP family member, PgFT1, a homolog of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene that promotes flowering. PgFT1 shows a rapid reduction in expression during the extensive vegetative growth immediately after pruning but shows robust expression during synchronous flowering post-pruning, in flower-bearing shoots but not in branches that do not bear flowers. A continuous low-level flowering in the absence of pruning is associated with continuous but reduced expression of PgFT1. Flowering by heterologous expression of PgFT1 in Arabidopsis is affected by a single amino acid change in the C-terminal region of PgFT1, which upon correction, promotes flowering in Arabidopsis. Our study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms by which pruning affects flowering pathways in tropical perennial fruit plants such as pomegranate.
