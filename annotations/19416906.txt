['19416906', 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated responses are in part regulated  by the repertoire of MAPK substrates, which is still poorly elucidated in plants.  Here, the in vivo enzyme-substrate interaction of the Arabidopsis thaliana MAP  kinase, MPK6, with an ethylene response factor (ERF104) is shown by fluorescence  resonance energy transfer. The interaction was rapidly lost in response to  flagellin-derived flg22 peptide. This complex disruption requires not only MPK6  activity, which also affects ERF104 stability via phosphorylation, but also  ethylene signaling. The latter points to a novel role of ethylene in substrate  release, presumably allowing the liberated ERF104 to access target genes.  Microarray data show enrichment of GCC motifs in the promoters of  ERF104-up-regulated genes, many of which are stress related. ERF104 is a vital  regulator of basal immunity, as altered expression in both erf104 and  overexpressors led to more growth inhibition by flg22 and enhanced susceptibility  to a non-adapted bacterial pathogen.', '2009 May 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0810206106', 'Lee']
