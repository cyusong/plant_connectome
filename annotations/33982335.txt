['33982335', 'Nucleotide-binding site (NBS)-leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain receptor (NLR)  proteins play important roles in plant innate immunity by recognizing pathogen  effectors. The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-NBS (TN) proteins belong to a  subtype of the atypical NLRs, but their function in plant immunity is poorly  understood. The well-characterized Arabidopsis thaliana typical coiled-coil  (CC)-NBS-LRR (CNL) protein Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae 5 (RPS5) is  activated after recognizing the Pseudomonas syringae type III effector AvrPphB.  To explore whether the truncated TN proteins function in CNL-mediated immune  signaling, we examined the interactions between the Arabidopsis TN proteins and  RPS5, and found that TN13 and TN21 interacted with RPS5. However, only TN13, but  not TN21, was involved in the resistance to P. syringae pv. tomato (Pto) strain  DC3000 carrying avrPphB, encoding the cognate effector recognized by RPS5.  Moreover, the regulation of Pto DC3000 avrPphB resistance by TN13 appeared to be  specific, as loss of function of TN13 did not compromise resistance to Pto DC3000  hrcC(-) or Pto DC3000 avrRpt2. In addition, we demonstrated that the CC and NBS  domains of RPS5 play essential roles in the interaction between TN13 and RPS5.  Taken together, our results uncover a direct functional link between TN13 and  RPS5, suggesting that TN13 acts as a partner in modulating RPS5-activated immune  signaling, which constitutes a previously unknown mechanism for TN-mediated  regulation of plant immunity.', '2021 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.15345', 'ORCID:']
