['19395639', 'Flowers develop from floral meristems, which harbor stem cells that support the  growth of floral organs. The MADS domain transcription factor AGAMOUS (AG) plays  a central role in floral patterning and is required not only for the  specification of the two reproductive organ types, but also for termination of  stem cell fate. Using a highly conserved cis-regulatory motif as bait, we  identified the bZIP transcription factor PERIANTHIA (PAN) as a direct regulator  of AG in Arabidopsis. PAN and AG expression domains overlap, and mutations in  either the PAN-binding site or PAN itself abolish the activity of a reporter  devoid of redundant elements. Whereas under long-day conditions pan mutants have  merely altered floral organ number, they display in addition typical AG  loss-of-function phenotypes when grown under short days. Consistently, we found  reduced AG RNA levels in these flowers. Finally, we show that PAN expression  persists in ag mutant flowers, suggesting that PAN and AG are engaged in a  negative-feedback loop, which might be mediated by the stem-cell-inducing  transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS).', '2009 May', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.033647', 'Lohmann']
