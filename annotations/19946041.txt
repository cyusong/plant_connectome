['19946041', 'Mitochondria (mt) in plants house about 20 group-II introns, which lie within  protein-coding genes required in both organellar genome expression and  respiration activities. While in nonplant systems the splicing of group-II  introns is mediated by proteins encoded within the introns themselves (known as  "maturases"), only a single maturase ORF (matR) has retained in the mitochondrial  genomes in plants; however, its putative role(s) in the splicing of organellar  introns is yet to be established. Clues to other proteins are scarce, but these  are likely encoded within the nucleus as there are no obvious candidates among  the remaining ORFs within the mtDNA. Intriguingly, higher plants genomes contain  four maturase-related genes, which exist in the nucleus as self-standing ORFs,  out of the context of their evolutionary-related group-II introns "hosts." These  are all predicted to reside within mitochondria and may therefore act "in-trans"  in the splicing of organellar-encoded introns. Here, we analyzed the  intracellular locations of the four nuclear-encoded maturases in Arabidopsis and  established the roles of one of these genes, At5g46920 (AtnMat2), in the splicing  of several mitochondrial introns, including the single intron within cox2, nad1  intron2, and nad7 intron2.', '2009 Dec', 'RNA', '10.1261/rna.1776409', 'Ostersetzer-Biran']
