Ongoing soil salinization drastically threatens crop growth, development, and yield worldwide. It is therefore crucial that we improve salt tolerance in rice by exploiting natural genetic variation. However, many salt-responsive genes confer undesirable phenotypes and therefore cannot be effectively applied to practical agricultural production. In this study, we identified a quantitative trait locus for salt tolerance from the African rice species Oryza glaberrima and named it as Salt Tolerance and Heading Date 1 (STH1). We found that STH1 regulates fatty acid metabolic homeostasis, probably by catalyzing the hydrolytic degradation of fatty acids, which contributes to salt tolerance. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that STH1 forms a protein complex with D3 and a vital regulatory factor in salt tolerance, OsHAL3, to regulate the protein abundance of OsHAL3 via the 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we revealed that STH1 also serves as a co-activator with the floral integrator gene Heading date 1 to balance the expression of the florigen gene Heading date 3a under different circumstances, thus coordinating the regulation of salt tolerance and heading date. Notably, the allele of STH1 associated with enhanced salt tolerance and high yield is found in some African rice accessions but barely in Asian cultivars. Introgression of the STH1<sup>HP46</sup> allele from African rice into modern rice cultivars is a desirable approach for boosting grain yield under salt stress. Collectively, our discoveries not only provide conceptual advances on the mechanisms of salt tolerance and synergetic regulation between salt tolerance and flowering time but also offer potential strategies to overcome the challenges resulted from increasingly serious soil salinization that many crops are facing.
