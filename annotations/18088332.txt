Labelling of plastids with fluorescent proteins has revealed the diversity of their sizes and shapes in different tissues of vascular plants. Stromules, stroma-filled tubules comprising thin extensions of the stroma surrounded by the double envelope membrane, have been observed to emanate from all major types of plastid, though less common on chloroplasts. In some tissue types, stromules are highly dynamic, forming, shrinking, attaching, releasing and fragmenting. Stromule formation is negatively affected by treatment of tissue with cytoskeletal inhibitors. Plastids can be connected by stromules, through which green fluorescent protein (GFP) and fluorescently tagged chloroplast protein complexes have been observed to flow. Within the highly viscous stroma, proteins traffic by diffusion as well as by an active process of directional travel, whose mechanism is unknown. In addition to exchanging materials between plastids, stromules may also serve to increase the surface area of the envelope for import and export, reduce diffusion distance between plastids and other organelles for exchange of materials, and anchor the plastid onto attachment points for proper positioning with the plant cell. Future studies should reveal how these functions may affect plants in adapting to the challenges of a changing environment.
