['10589676', 'The formation of the root epidermis of Arabidopsis provides a simple and elegant  model for the analysis of cell patterning. A novel gene, WEREWOLF (WER), is  described here that is required for position-dependent patterning of the  epidermal cell types. The WER gene encodes a MYB-type protein and is  preferentially expressed within cells destined to adopt the non-hair fate.  Furthermore, WER is shown to regulate the position-dependent expression of the  GLABRA2 homeobox gene, to interact with a bHLH protein, and to act in opposition  to the CAPRICE MYB. These results suggest a simple model to explain the  specification of the two root epidermal cell types, and they provide insight into  the molecular mechanisms used to control cell patterning.', '1999 Nov 24', 'Cell', '10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81536-6', 'Schiefelbein']
