To compare transcription profiles in genotypes of Glycine tomentella that are differentially sensitive to soybean rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi, four cDNA libraries were constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization method. Libraries were constructed from rust-infected and non-infected leaves of resistant (PI509501) and susceptible (PI441101) genotypes of G. tomentella, and subjected to subtractive hybridization. A total of 1,536 sequences were obtained from these cDNA libraries from which 195 contigs and 865 singletons were identified. Of these sequenced cDNA clones, functions of 646 clones (61%) were determined. In addition, 160 clones (15%) had significant homology to hypothetical proteins; while the remaining 254 clones (24%) did not reveal any hits. Of those 646 clones with known functions, different genes encoding protein products involved in metabolism, cell defense, energy, protein synthesis, transcription, and cellular transport were identified. These findings were subsequently confirmed by real time RT-PCR and dot blot hybridization.
