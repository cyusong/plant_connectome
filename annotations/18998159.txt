Flavonol synthase (FLS) (EC-number 1.14.11.23), the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of flavonols into dihydroflavonols, is part of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. In Arabidopsis thaliana, this activity is thought to be encoded by several loci. In addition to the FLAVONOL SYNTHASE1 (FLS1) locus that has been confirmed by enzyme activity assays, loci displaying similarity of the deduced amino acid sequences to FLS1 have been identified. We studied the putative A. thaliana FLS gene family using a combination of genetic and metabolite analysis approaches. Although several of the FLS gene family members are expressed, only FLS1 appeared to influence flavonoid biosynthesis. Seedlings of an A. thaliana fls1 null mutant (fls1-2) show enhanced anthocyanin levels, drastic reduction in flavonol glycoside content and concomitant accumulation of glycosylated forms of dihydroflavonols, the substrate of the FLS reaction. By using a leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (ldox) fls1-2 double mutant, we present evidence that the remaining flavonol glycosides found in the fls1-2 mutant are synthesized in planta by the FLS-like side activity of the LDOX enzyme.
