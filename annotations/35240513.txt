Inositol transporters (INT) are thought to be the pivotal transporters for vital metabolites, in particular lipids, minerals, and sugars. These transporters play an important role in transitional metabolism and various signaling pathways in plants through regulating the transduction of messages from hormones, neurotransmitters, and immunologic and growth factors. Extensive studies have been conducted on animal INT, with promising outcomes. However, only few recent studies have highlighted the importance and complexity of INT genes in the regulation of plant physiology stages, including growth and tolerance to stress conditions. The present review summarizes the most recent findings concerning the role of INT or inositol genes in plant metabolism and the response mechanisms triggered by external stressors. Moreover, we highlight the emerging role of vacuoles and vacuolar INT in plant molecular transition and their related roles in plant growth and development. INTs are the essential mediators of inositol uptake and its intracellular broadcasting for various metabolic pathways where they play crucial roles. Additionally, we report evidence on Na<sup>+</sup>/inositol transporters, which until now have only been characterized in animals, as well as H<sup>+</sup>/inositol symporters and their kinetic functions and physiological role and suggest their roles and operating mode in plants. A more comprehensive understanding of the INT functioning system, in particular the coordinated movement of inositol and the relation between inositol generation and other important plant signaling pathways, would greatly advance the study of plant stress adaptation.
