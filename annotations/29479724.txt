Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental process in eukaryotic cells. Although Urb2 protein has been implicated in ribosome biogenesis in yeast, the Urb2 domain is loosely conserved between plants and yeast, and the function of Urb2 protein in plants remains unknown. Here, we isolated a maize mutant, designated as urb2, with defects in kernel development and vegetative growth. Positional cloning and transgenic analysis revealed that urb2 encodes an Urb2 domain-containing protein. Compared with the wild-type (WT), the urb2 mutant showed decreased ratios of 60S/40S and 80S/40S and increased ratios of polyribosomes. The pre-rRNA intermediates of 35/33S rRNA, P-A3 and 18S-A3 were significantly accumulated in the urb2 mutant. Transcriptome profiling of the urb2 mutant indicated that ZmUrb2 affects the expression of a number of ribosome-related genes. We further demonstrated that natural variations in ZmUrb2 are significantly associated with maize kernel length. The overall results indicate that, by affecting pre-rRNA processing, the Urb2 protein is required for ribosome biogenesis in maize.
