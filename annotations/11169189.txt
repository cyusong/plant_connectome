['11169189', 'In the chloroplast of higher plants, two types of thioredoxins (TRX), namely TRX  m which shows high similarity to prokaryotic thioredoxins and TRX f which is more  closely related to eukaryotic thioredoxins, have been found and biochemically  characterized, but little is known about their physiological specificity with  respect to their target(s). Here, we tested, in vivo, the ability of  organelle-specific TRX from Arabidopsis thaliana to compensate for TRX deficiency  of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strain. Seven plant organellar TRX (four of  the m type, two of the f type and a newly discovered TRX x of prokaryotic type)  were expressed in yeast in a putative mature form. None of these heterologous TRX  were able to restore growth on sulphate or methionine sulphoxide of the mutant  cells. When we tested their ability to rescue the oxidant-hypersensitive  phenotype of the TRX-deficient strain, we found that TRX m and TRX x, but not TRX  f, affected the tolerance to oxidative stress induced by either hydrogen peroxide  or an alkyl hydroperoxide. Athm1, Athm2, Athm4 and Athx induced hydrogen peroxide  tolerance like the endogenous yeast thioredoxins. Unexpectedly, Athm3 had a  hypersensitizing effect towards oxidative stress. The presence of functional  heterologous TRX was checked in the recombinant clones tested, supporting  distinct abilities for organelle-specific plant TRX to compensate for TRX  deficiency in yeast. We propose a new function for the prokaryotic-type  chloroplastic TRX as an anti-oxidant and provide in vivo evidence for different  roles of chloroplastic TRX isoforms.', '2001 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.0960-7412.2000.00943.x', 'Miginiac-Maslow']
