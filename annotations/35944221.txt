BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1), a core transcription factor in the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway, primarily regulates plant growth and development by influencing BR-regulated gene expression. Several E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases regulate BES1 stability, but little is known about BES1 deubiquitination, which antagonizes E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination to maintain BES1 homeostasis. Here, we report that two Arabidopsis thaliana deubiquitinating enzymes, Ub-SPECIFIC PROTEASE (UBP) 12 and UBP13, interact with BES1. UBP12 and UBP13 removed Ub from polyubiquitinated BES1 to stabilize both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of BES1. A double mutant, ubp12-2w ubp13-3, lacking UBP12 and UBP13 function showed both BR-deficient and BR-insensitive phenotypes, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing UBP12 or UBP13 exhibited an increased BR response. Expression of UBP12 and UPB13 was induced during recovery after carbon starvation, which led to BES1 accumulation and quick recovery of stressed plants. Our work thus establishes a mechanism by which UBP12 and UBP13 regulate BES1 protein abundance to enhance BR-regulated growth during recovery after carbon starvation.
