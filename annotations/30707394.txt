In this study, we first linked the signal molecule H<sub>2</sub>S with cucurbitacin C, which can cause the bitter taste of cucumber leaves and fruit, and specifically discuss its molecular mechanism. Cucurbitacin C (CuC), a triterpenoid secondary metabolite, enhances the resistance of cucumber plants to pathogenic bacteria and insect herbivores, but results in bitter-tasting fruits. CuC can be induced in some varieties of cucumber on exposure to plant stressors. The gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) participates in multiple physiological processes relating to plant stress resistance. This study focused on the effect of H<sub>2</sub>S on low temperature-induced CuC synthesis in cucumber. The results showed that treatment of cucumber leaves at 4 °C for 12 h enhanced the content and production rate of H<sub>2</sub>S and increased the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in H<sub>2</sub>S generation, Csa2G034800.1 (CsaLCD), Csa1G574800.1 (CsaDES1), and Csa1G574810.1 (CsaDES2). In addition, treatment at 4 °C or with exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S upregulated the expression of CuC synthetase-encoding genes and the resulting CuC content in cucumber leaves, whereas pretreatment with hypotaurine (HT, a H<sub>2</sub>S scavenger) before treatment at 4 °C offset these effects. In vitro, H<sub>2</sub>S could increase the S-sulfhydration level of His-Csa5G156220 and His-Csa5G157230 (both bHLH transcription factors), as well as their binding activity to the promoter of Csa6G088690, which encodes the key synthetase for CuC generation. H<sub>2</sub>S pretreatment enhanced the cucumber leaves resistance to the Phytophthora melonis. Together, these results demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub>S acts as a positive regulator of CuC synthesis as a result of the modification of proteins by S-sulfhydration, also providing indirect evidence for the role of H<sub>2</sub>S in improving the resistance of plants to abiotic stresses and biotic stresses by regulating the synthesis of secondary metabolites.
