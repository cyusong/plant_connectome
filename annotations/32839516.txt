Seed size is a pivotal agronomic trait that links plant sexual reproduction and subsequent seedling establishment, and is affected by the timing of endosperm cellularization following endosperm proliferation after double fertilization. The molecular switch that controls the timing of endosperm cellularization has so far been largely unclear. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) is a mobile regulator generated in the chalazal endosperm, and moves to the syncytial peripheral endosperm to mediate timely endosperm cellularization and seed size through stabilizing ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 5. We further show that Ras-related nuclear GTPases interact with TFL1 and regulate its trafficking to the syncytial peripheral endosperm. Our findings reveal TFL1 as an essential molecular switch for regulating endosperm cellularization and seed size. Generation of mobile TFL1 in the chalazal endosperm, which is close to maternal vascular tissues, could provide a hitherto-unknown means to control seed development by mother plants.
