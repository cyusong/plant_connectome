Considerable evidence has appeared over the past few years that nitric oxide (NO) is an important anoxic metabolite and a potent signal molecule in plants. Several pathways operative in different cell compartments, lead to NO production. Mitochondria, being a major NO producing compartment, can generate it by either nitrite reduction occurring at nearly anoxic conditions or by the oxidative route via nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Recently we compared both pathways by ozone collision chemiluminescence and by DAF fluorescence. We found that nitrite reduction to NO is associated with the mitochondrial membrane fraction but not with the matrix. In case of the nitric oxide synthase pathway, an L-arginine dependent fluorescence was detected but its response to NOS inhibitors and substrates was untypical. Therefore the existence of NOS or NOS-like activity in barley root mitochondria is very doubtful. We also found that mitochondria scavenge NO. In addition, we found indirect evidence that mitochondria are able to convert NO to gaseous intermediates like NO2, N2O and N2O3.
