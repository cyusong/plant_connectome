Microgreens are rich functional crops with valuable nutritional elements that have health benefits when used as food supplements. Growth characterization, nutritional composition profile of 21 varieties representing five species of the Brassica genus as microgreens were assessed under light-emitting diodes (LEDs) conditions. Microgreens were grown under four different LEDs ratios (%); red:blue 80:20 and 20:80 (R<sub>80</sub> :B<sub>20</sub> and R<sub>20</sub> :B<sub>80</sub> ), or red:green:blue 70:10:20 and 20:10:70 (R<sub>70</sub> :G<sub>10</sub> :B<sub>20</sub> and R<sub>20</sub> :G<sub>10</sub> :B<sub>70</sub> ). Results indicated that supplemental lighting with green LEDs (R<sub>70</sub> :G<sub>10</sub> :B<sub>20</sub> ) enhanced vegetative growth and morphology, while blue LEDs (R<sub>20</sub> :B<sub>80</sub> ) increased the mineral and vitamin contents. Interestingly, by linking the nutritional content with the growth yield to define the optimal LEDs setup, we found that the best lighting to promote the microgreen growth was the green LEDs combination (R<sub>70</sub> :G<sub>10</sub> :B<sub>20</sub> ). Remarkably, under the green LEDs combination (R<sub>70</sub> :G<sub>10</sub> :B<sub>20</sub> ) conditions, the microgreens of Kohlrabi purple, Cabbage red, Broccoli, Kale Tucsan, Komatsuna red, Tatsoi and Cabbage green, which can benefit human health in conditions with limited food, had the highest growth and nutritional content.
