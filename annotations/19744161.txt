['19744161', 'The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) is part of central metabolism,  consisting of two distinct phases: the oxidative phase and the non-oxidative  phase. The non-oxidative phase of the oxPPP generates carbon skeletons for the  synthesis of nucleotides, aromatic amino acids, phenylpropanoids and their  derivatives, which are essential for plant growth and development. However, it is  not well understood how the non-oxidative phase of the oxPPP contributes to plant  growth and development. Here, we report the characterization of Arabidopsis T-DNA  knockout mutants of the RPI2 gene (At2g01290), which encodes a cytosolic  ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) that catalyzes the reversible interconversion  of ribulose-5-phosphate and ribose-5-phosphate in the non-oxidative phase of the  oxPPP. Although recombinant Arabidopsis RPI2 protein exhibits marked RPI  enzymatic activity, knockout of the RPI2 gene does not significantly change the  total RPI activity in the mutant plants. Interestingly, knockout of RPI2  interferes with chloroplast structure and decreases chloroplast photosynthetic  capacity. The rpi2 mutants accumulate less starch in the leaves and flower  significantly later than wild-type when grown under short-day conditions.  Furthermore, the rpi2 mutants display premature cell death in the leaves when  grown at an above-normal temperature (26 degrees C). These results demonstrate  that a deficiency in the non-oxidative phase of the cytosolic oxPPP has  pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development and causes premature cell  death.', '2009 Nov', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/j.1399-3054.2009.01276.x', 'Mou']
