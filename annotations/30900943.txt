<i>Stemphylium vesicarium</i> is the causal agent of several plant diseases as well brown spot of pear (BSP), which is one of the most economically important fungal diseases in European pear-production areas. In addition to the relevance of the economic impact, conidia spread widely from plant material infected by the pathogen can trigger respiratory allergy. Here, we report the first genome of a <i>S. vesicarium</i> strain, 173-1a13FI1M3, isolated from pear and sensitive to the mostly used fungicide classes currently authorized in Europe against BSP. The availability of this draft genome could represent a first important step in understanding the physiology and the infection mechanism of the pathogen. Furthermore, this contribution could be fundamental in order to design more effective and sustainable strategies to control the disease.
