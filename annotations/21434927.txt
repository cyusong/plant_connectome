['21434927', '* Enhanced Disease Susceptibility1 (EDS1) is an important regulator of plant  basal and receptor-triggered immunity. Arabidopsis EDS1 interacts with two  related proteins, Phytoalexin Deficient4 (PAD4) and Senescence Associated Gene101  (SAG101), whose combined activities are essential for defense signaling. The  different sizes and intracellular distributions of EDS1-PAD4 and EDS1-SAG101  complexes in Arabidopsis leaf tissues suggest that they perform nonredundant  functions. * The nature and biological relevance of EDS1 interactions with PAD4  and SAG101 were explored using yeast three-hybrid assays, in vitro analysis of  recombinant proteins purified from Escherichia coli, and characterization of  Arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing an eds1 mutant (eds1(L262P) ) protein  which no longer binds PAD4 but retains interaction with SAG101. * EDS1 forms  molecularly distinct complexes with PAD4 or SAG101 without additional plant  factors. Loss of interaction with EDS1 reduces PAD4 post-transcriptional  accumulation, consistent with the EDS1 physical association stabilizing PAD4. The  dissociated forms of EDS1 and PAD4 are fully competent in signaling  receptor-triggered localized cell death at infection foci. By contrast, an  EDS1-PAD4 complex is necessary for basal resistance involving transcriptional  up-regulation of PAD4 itself and mobilization of salicylic acid defenses. *  Different EDS1 and PAD4 molecular configurations have distinct and separable  functions in the plant innate immune response.', '2011 Jul', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03675.x', 'Parker']
