['7716246', "The levels of beta-amylase activity and of the mRNA for beta-amylase in rosette  leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. increased significantly, with the  concomitant accumulation of starch, when whole plants or excised mature leaves  were supplied with sucrose. A supply of glucose or fructose, but not of mannitol  or sorbitol, to plants also induced the expression of the gene for beta-amylase,  and the induction occurred not only in rosette leaves but also in roots, stems,  and bracts. These results suggest that the gene for beta-amylase of Arabidopsis  is subject to regulation by a carbohydrate metabolic signal, and expression of  the gene in various tissues may be regulated by the carbon partitioning and  sink-source interactions in the whole plant. The sugar-inducible expression of  the gene in Arabidopsis was severely repressed in the absence of light. The  sugar-inducible expression in the light was not inhibited by  3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea or by chloramphenicol, but it was  inhibited by cycloheximide. These results suggest that a light-induced signal and  de novo synthesis of proteins in the cytoplasm are involved in the regulation. A  fusion gene composed of the 5' upstream region of the gene for beta-amylase from  Arabidopsis and the coding sequence of beta-glucuronidase showed the  sugar-inducible expression in a light-dependent manner in rosette leaves of  transgenic Arabidopsis.", '1995 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.107.3.895', 'Nakamura']
