In negotiating with the environment, plant roots integrate sensory information over space and time, as the basis of decision making in roots under non-uniform conditions. The complexity and dynamic properties of soil across spatial and temporal scales pose a significant technical challenge for research on mechanisms that drive metabolism, growth and development in roots, as well as on inter-organismal networks in the rhizosphere. Synthetic environments, combining microscopic access and manipulation capabilities with soil-like heterogeneity, are needed to elucidate the intriguing tug-of-war that characterises subsurface ecosystems. Microdevices have provided opportunities for innovative approaches to observe, analyse and manipulate plant roots and advanced our understanding of their development, physiology and interactions with the environment. Initially conceived as perfusion platforms for root cultivation under hydroponic conditions, microdevice design has, in recent years, increasingly shifted to better reflect the complex growth conditions in soil. Heterogeneous micro-environments have been created through co-cultivation with microbes, laminar flow-based local stimulation and physical obstacles and constraints. As such, structured microdevices provide an experimental entry point to the complex network behaviour of soil communities.
