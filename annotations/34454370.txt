Raffinose, stachyose and verbascose form the three major members of the raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO) accumulated during seed development. Raffinose synthase (RS; EC 2.4.1.82) and stachyose synthase (STS; EC 2.4.1.67) have been associated with raffinose and stachyose synthesis, but the precise mechanism for verbascose synthesis is not well understood. In this study, full-length RS (2.7 kb) and STS (2.6 kb) clones were isolated by screening a cDNA library prepared from developing lentil seeds (18, 20, 22 and 24 days after flowering [DAF]) to understand the roles of RS and STS in RFO accumulation in developing lentil seeds. The nucleotide sequences of RS and STS genes were similar to those reported for Pisum sativum. Patterns of transcript accumulation, enzyme activities and RFO concentrations were also comparable to P. sativum. However, during lentil seed development raffinose, stachyose and verbascose accumulation corresponded to transcript accumulation for RS and STS, with peak transcript abundance occurring at about 22-24 DAF, generally followed by a sequential increase in raffinose, stachyose and verbascose concentrations followed by a steady level thereafter. Enzyme activities for RS, STS and verbascose synthase (VS) also indicated a sudden increase at around 24-26 DAF, but with an abrupt decline again coinciding with the subsequent steady state increase in the RFO. Galactan:galactan galactosyl transferase (GGT), the galactinol-independent pathway enzyme, however, exhibited steady increase in activity from 24 DAF onwards before abruptly decreasing at 34 DAF. Although GGT activity was detected, isolation of a GGT sequence from the cDNA library was not successful.
