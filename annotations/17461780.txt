['17461780', 'Mutations in the TUMOROUS SHOOT DEVELOPMENT2 (TSD2) gene reduce cell adhesion,  and in strongly affected individuals cause non-coordinated shoot development that  leads to disorganized tumor-like growth in vitro. tsd2 mutants showed increased  activity of axial meristems, reduced root growth and enhanced de-etiolation. The  expression domains of the shoot meristem marker genes KNAT1 and KNAT2 were  enlarged in the mutant background. Soil-grown tsd2 mutants were dwarfed, but  overall showed morphology similar to that of the wild-type (WT). The TSD2 gene  was identified by map-based cloning. It encodes a novel 684 amino acid  polypeptide containing a single membrane-spanning domain in the N-terminal part  and S-adenosyl-l-methionine binding and methyltransferase domains in the  C-terminal part. Expression of a TSD2:GUS reporter gene was detected mainly in  meristems and young tissues. A green fluorescent protein-tagged TSD2 protein  localized to the Golgi apparatus. The cell-adhesion defects indicated altered  pectin properties, and we hypothesize that TSD2 acts as a pectin  methyltransferase. However, analyses of the cell-wall composition revealed no  significant differences of the monosaccharide composition, the uronic acid  content and the overall degree of pectin methylesterification between tsd2 and  WT. The findings support a function of TSD2 as a methyltransferase, with an  essential role in cell adhesion and coordinated plant development.', '2007 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03123.x', 'Schmulling']
