['31776233', 'Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and development. Any  defects in the maintenance of Fe homeostasis will alter plant productivity and  the quality of their derived products. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the  transcription factor ILR3 plays a central role in controlling Fe homeostasis. In  this study, we identified bHLH121 as an ILR3-interacting transcription factor.  Interaction studies showed that bHLH121 also interacts with the three closest  homologs of ILR3 (i.e., basic-helix-loop-helix 34 [bHLH34], bHLH104, and  bHLH115). bhlh121 loss-of-function mutants displayed severe defects in Fe  homeostasis that could be reverted by exogenous Fe supply. bHLH121 acts as a  direct transcriptional activator of key genes involved in the Fe regulatory  network, including bHLH38, bHLH39, bHLH100, bHLH101, POPEYE, BRUTUS, and BRUTUS  LIKE1, as well as IRONMAN1 and IRONMAN2 In addition, bHLH121 is necessary for  activating the expression of transcription factor gene FIT in response to Fe  deficiency via an indirect mechanism. bHLH121 is expressed throughout the plant  body, and its expression is not affected by Fe availability. By contrast, Fe  availability affects the cellular localization of bHLH121 protein in roots.  Altogether, these data show that bHLH121 is a regulator of Fe homeostasis that  acts upstream of FIT in concert with ILR3 and its closest homologs.', '2020 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00541', 'ORCID:']
