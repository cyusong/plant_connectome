<i>Cytospora chrysosperma</i> is the main causal agent of poplar canker disease in China, especially in some areas with poor site conditions. Pathogens secrete a large number of effectors to interfere the plant immunity and promote their infection and colonization. Nevertheless, the roles of effectors in <i>C. chrysosperma</i> remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized a candidate effector CcSp84 from <i>C. chrysosperma</i>, which contained a nuclear localization signal motif at the C-terminal and was highly induced during infection stages. Transient expression of CcSp84 in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves could trigger cell death. Additionally, deletion of CcSp84 significantly reduced fungal virulence to the polar twigs, while no obvious defects were observed in fungal growth and sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Confocal microscopy revealed that CcSp84 labeled with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) was mainly accumulated in the plant nucleus. Further analysis revealed that the plant nucleus localization of CcSp84 was necessary to trigger plant immune responses, including ROS accumulation, callose deposition, and induced expression of jasmonic acid and ethylene defense-related genes. Collectively, our results suggest that CcSp84 is a virulence-related effector, and plant nucleus localization is required for its functions.
