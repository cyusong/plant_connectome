Flavonoid biosynthesis is strongly influenced by phytohormones. For example, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) enhances the flavonoid accumulation in pear. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the MeJA-induced flavonoid biosynthesis in pear is largely uncharacterized. Therefore, the transcriptome of pear calli treated with MeJA was analyzed to elucidate the mechanism regulating MeJA-mediated flavonoid biosynthesis. The application of exogenous MeJA significantly enhanced flavonoid accumulation, especially anthocyanin, in pear calli. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified the differentially expressed genes associated with MeJA-induced flavonoid biosynthesis. The MeJA treatment upregulated the expression of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway structural genes (PcCHS, PcCHI, PcF3H, PcDFR, PcANS, PcANR2a, and PcLAR1). The MYB family members were the main transcription factors regulating the MeJA-induced flavonoid biosynthesis, but the bHLH, AP2-EREBP, NAC, WRKY, and TIFY families were also involved. In addition to PcMYB10, which is a known positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in pear, several novel MYB candidates that may regulate flavonol and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis were revealed. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that PcMYB10 and PcMYC2 can directly interact with each other and bind to JAZ repressors (PcJAZ1 and PcJAZ2). The PcMYB10-PcMYC2 molecular complex is likely involved in the regulation of jasmonate-mediated flavonoid biosynthesis at the transcript level. The data generated in this study may clarify the transcriptional regulatory network associated with the MeJA-induced flavonoid accumulation in pear calli and provide a solid foundation for future studies.
