During the lifetime of an angiosperm plant various important processes such as floral transition, specification of floral organ identity and floral determinacy, are controlled by members of the MADS domain transcription factor family. To investigate the possible non-cell-autonomous function of MADS domain proteins, we expressed GFP-tagged clones of AGAMOUS (AG), APETALA3 (AP3), PISTILLATA (PI) and SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) under the control of the MERISTEMLAYER1 promoter in Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Morphological analyses revealed that epidermal overexpression was sufficient for homeotic changes in floral organs, but that it did not result in early flowering or terminal flower phenotypes that are associated with constitutive overexpression of these proteins. Localisations of the tagged proteins in these plants were analysed with confocal laser scanning microscopy in leaf tissue, inflorescence meristems and floral meristems. We demonstrated that only AG is able to move via secondary plasmodesmata from the epidermal cell layer to the subepidermal cell layer in the floral meristem and to a lesser extent in the inflorescence meristem. To study the homeotic effects in more detail, the capacity of trafficking AG to complement the ag mutant phenotype was compared with the capacity of the non-inwards-moving AP3 protein to complement the ap3 mutant phenotype. While epidermal expression of AG gave full complementation, AP3 appeared not to be able to drive all homeotic functions from the epidermis, perhaps reflecting the difference in mobility of these proteins.

AGAMOUS: !moves via! secondary plasmodesmata
AGAMOUS: !complements! ag mutant phenotype
APETALA3: !complements! ap3 mutant phenotype
APETALA3: !unable to drive! homeotic functions
