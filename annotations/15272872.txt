['15272872', "Phosphatidic acid (PA) is emerging as an important lipid signalling molecule. In  plants, it is implicated in various stress-signalling pathways and is formed in  response to wounding, osmotic stress, cold stress, pathogen elicitors, Nod  factors, ethylene and abscisic acid. How PA exerts its effects is still unknown,  mainly because of the lack of characterized PA targets. In an approach to isolate  such targets we have used PA-affinity chromatography. Several PA-binding proteins  were present in the soluble fraction of tomato and Arabidopsis cells. Using mass  spectrometric analysis, several of these proteins, including Hsp90, 14-3-3  proteins, an SnRK2 serine/threonine protein kinase and the PP2A regulatory  subunit RCN1 could be identified. As an example, the binding of one major  PA-binding protein, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), was characterized  further. Competition experiments with different phospholipids confirmed  specificity for PA. Hypo-osmotic treatment of the cells increased the amount of  PEPC that bound the PA beads without increasing the absolute amount of PEPC. This  suggests that PEPC's affinity for PA had increased. The work shows that  PA-affinity chromatography/mass spectrometry is an effective way to isolate and  identify PA-binding proteins from plants.", '2004 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02152.x', 'Munnik']
