The ability of some animals to sense magnetic fields has long captured the human imagination. In our recent paper, we explored how radical pair effects in the protein cryptochrome may underlie the magnetic orientation sense of migratory birds. Here we explain our model and discuss its relationship to experimental results on plant cryptochromes, as well as discuss the next steps in refining our model, and explore alternate but related possibilities for modeling and understanding cryptochrome as a magnetic sensor.

cryptochrome: !underlies! magnetic orientation sense 
radical pair effects: !affects! cryptochrome 
plant cryptochromes: !related to! radical pair effects 
model: !refines! experimental results 
model: !explores! alternate possibilities
