RIN4 is an intensively studied immune regulator in Arabidopsis and is involved in perception of microbial features outside and bacterial effectors inside plant cells. Furthermore, RIN4 is conserved in land plants and is targeted for posttranslational modifications by several virulence proteins from the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Despite the important roles of RIN4 in plant immune responses, its molecular function is not known. RIN4 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), except at regions where pathogen-induced posttranslational modifications take place. IDP act as hubs for protein complex formation due to their ability to bind to multiple client proteins and, thus, are important players in signal transduction pathways. RIN4 is known to associate with multiple proteins involved in immunity, likely acting as an immune-signaling hub for the formation of distinct protein complexes. Genetically, RIN4 is a negative regulator of immunity, but diverse posttranslational modifications can either enhance its negative regulatory function or, on the contrary, render it a potent immune activator. In this review, we describe the structural domains of RIN4 proteins, their intrinsically disordered regions, posttranslational modifications, and highlight the implications that these features have on RIN4 function. In addition, we will discuss the potential role of plasma membrane subdomains in mediating RIN4 protein complex formations.
