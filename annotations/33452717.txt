Rice is one of the most susceptible plants to iron (Fe) deficiency under neutral and alkaline conditions. Alkaline stress induces H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production and increases the deposition of Fe on the root surface, which causes leaf chlorosis and Fe deficiency in rice. Gene chip and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of the nitrate reductase (NR) genes were downregulated by alkaline treatment, which resulted in significantly decreased nitrate activity and nitric oxide (NO) production in the epidermis and stele, where H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> accumulated. In contrast, treatment with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, strongly alleviated alkaline-induced Fe deficiency by limiting Fe plaque formation. Increasing the NO signal significantly reduced the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and the lignin barrier but enhanced phenolic acid secretion in the root epidermis and stele under alkaline conditions. The secreted phenolic acid effectively mobilized the apoplast Fe and increased Fe uptake in roots, thereby alleviating the Fe-deficiency response and downregulating the expressions of Fe-uptake genes under alkaline conditions. In conclusion, alkaline stress inhibits NR activity and NO production in the roots of rice, which play vital roles in the mobilization of the apoplast Fe by regulation of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and phenolic acid concentrations.
