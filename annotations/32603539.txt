Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) constitute a major group of proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The multicellular green alga Volvox carteri is a suitable model organism in which to study the evolutionary transition to multicellularity, including the basic principles and characteristics of an ECM. In Volvox, the ECM is dominated by a single HRGP family: the pherophorins. Our inventory amounts to 117 pherophorin-related genes in V. carteri. We focused on a pherophorin with an unexpected characteristic: pherophorin-S is a soluble, non-cross-linked ECM protein. Using transformants expressing a YFP-tagged pherophorin-S we observed the synthesis and secretion of pherophorin-S by somatic cells in vivo, and we then traced the protein during its conspicuous migration to the ECM around prehatching juveniles and its localized concentration there. Our results provide insights into how an ECM zone surrounding the progeny is remotely affected by distantly located parental somatic cells. In view of the properties and migration of pherophorin-S, we conclude that pherophorin-S is likely to act as an ECM plasticizer to allow for dynamic ECM remodeling.
