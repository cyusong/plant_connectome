Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been emerging as a key regulator in plant organ abscission. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of ROS homeostasis in the abscission zone (AZ) is not completely established. Here, we report that a DOF (DNA binding with one finger) transcription factor LcDOF5.6 can suppress the litchi fruitlet abscission through repressing the ROS accumulation in fruitlet AZ (FAZ). The expression of LcRbohD, a homolog of the Arabidopsis RBOHs that are critical for ROS production, was significantly increased during the litchi fruitlet abscission, in parallel with an increased accumulation of ROS in FAZ. In contrast, silencing of LcRbohD reduced the ROS accumulation in FAZ and decreased the fruitlet abscission in litchi. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we revealed that LcDOF5.6 was shown to inhibit the expression of LcRbohD via direct binding to its promoter. Consistently, silencing of LcDOF5.6 increased the expression of LcRbohD, concurrently with higher ROS accumulation in FAZ and increased fruitlet abscission. Furthermore, the expression of key genes (LcIDL1, LcHSL2, LcACO2, LcACS1, and LcEIL3) in INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION signaling and ethylene pathways were altered in LcRbohD-silenced and LcDOF5.6-silenced FAZ cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate an important role of the LcDOF5.6-LcRbohD module during litchi fruitlet abscission. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular regulatory network of organ abscission.
