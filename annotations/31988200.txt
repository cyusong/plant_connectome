['31988200', 'In autogamous plants like Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), stamen filament  elongation must be finely regulated to ensure that anthers reach the pistil at  the correct developmental stage. In this work, we studied the roles of  Arabidopsis TEOSINTE BRANCHED1, CYCLOIDEA, PCF15 (TCP15), and related class-I TCP  transcription factors in stamen filament elongation. Plants with decreased  expression of class-I TCPs and plants that express a fusion of TCP15 to a  repressor domain (pTCP15::TCP15-EAR) had shorter stamens, indicating that class-I  TCPs stimulate filament growth. These plants also showed reduced expression of  several SMALL AUXIN UP RNA (SAUR)63 subfamily genes, which contain TCP target  motifs in their promoters. Mutational analysis indicated that the TCP target  motif in the SAUR63 promoter is required for expression of SAUR63 in stamen  filaments. Moreover, TCP15 directly binds to the SAUR63 promoter region that  contains the TCP target motif in vivo, highlighting the role of the TCPs in this  process. Class-I TCPs are also required for the induction of SAUR63 subfamily  genes by gibberellins (GAs). In addition, overexpression of SAUR63 restores  filament growth in pTCP15::TCP15-EAR plants, whereas overexpression of TCP15  rescues the short stamen phenotype of GA-deficient plants. The results indicate  that TCP15 and related class-I TCPs modulate GA-dependent stamen filament  elongation by direct activation of SAUR63 subfamily genes through conserved  target sites in their promoters. This work provides insight into GA-dependent  stamen filament elongation.', '2020 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.01501', 'ORCID:']
