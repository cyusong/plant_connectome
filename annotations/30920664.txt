Methylation of DNA is an epigenetic mechanism for the control of gene expression. Alterations in the regulatory pathways involved in the establishment, perpetuation and removal of DNA methylation can lead to severe developmental alterations. Our understanding of the mechanistic aspects and relevance of DNA methylation comes from remarkable studies in well-established angiosperm plant models including maize and Arabidopsis. The study of plant models positioned at basal lineages opens exciting opportunities to expand our knowledge on the function and evolution of the components of DNA methylation. In this Tansley Insight, we summarize current progress in our understanding of the molecular basis and relevance of DNA methylation in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha.
