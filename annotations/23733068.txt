Since the discovery of the first dual targeted protein in plants in 1995 the number of dual targeted proteins in plants has grown to over 250 proteins. Much work and investigations have focused on identifying how or what makes a protein dual targeted. Recently, more research has focused on the evolution and conservation of dual targeting of proteins in plants. This new work has demonstrated that dual targeting arose early within the evolution of plants and because it is rarely lost, once gained, it must be under some positive selection pressure. The possible reasons as why proteins are dual targeted and why it was conserved during the evolution of plants are discussed.
