Changes in the spatiotemporal concentration of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]) in different organelles of the cell contribute to responses of plants to physiological and environmental stimuli. One example are [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ] increases in the stroma of chloroplasts during light-to-dark transitions; however, the function and mechanisms responsible are unknown, in part because there is a disagreement in the literature concerning whether corresponding dark-induced changes in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> ) can be detected. We have measured changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> upon darkness in addition to the already known dark-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>stroma</sub> in the aerial part of the Arabidopsis thaliana plant. These [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> transients depend on the photoperiod and time of day, peaking at anticipated dusk, and are superimposed on daily 24 h oscillations in [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> . We also find that the magnitude of the dark-induced increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in both the cytosol and chloroplasts are gated by the nuclear circadian oscillator. The modulation of the magnitude of dark-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>stroma</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> by transcriptional regulators in the nucleus that are part of the circadian oscillator demonstrates a new role for the circadian system in subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, in addition to its role in driving circadian oscillations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ] in the cytosol and chloroplasts.
