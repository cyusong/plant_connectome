Conjugation of the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) to protein substrates has an impact on stress responses and on development. We analyzed the proteome and phosphoproteome of mutants in this pathway. The mutants chosen had defects in SUMO ligase SIZ1, which catalyzes attachment of single SUMO moieties onto substrates, and in ligases PIAL1 and PIAL2, which are known to form SUMO chains. A total of 2657 proteins and 550 phosphopeptides were identified and quantified. Approximately 40% of the proteins and 20% of the phosphopeptides showed differences in abundance in at least one of the analyzed genotypes, demonstrating the influence of SUMO conjugation on protein abundance and phosphorylation. The data show that PIAL1 and PIAL2 are integral parts of the SUMO conjugation system with an impact on stress response, and confirm the involvement of SIZ1 in plant defense. We find a high abundance of predicted SUMO attachment sites in phosphoproteins (70% versus 40% in the total proteome), suggesting convergence of phosphorylation and sumoylation signals onto a set of common targets.
