Leaf angle (LA), defined as the angle between the plant stem and leaf adaxial side of the blade, generally shapes the plant architecture into a loosen or dense structure, and thus influences the light interception and competition between neighboring plants in natural settings, ultimately contributing to the crop yield and productivity. It has been elucidated that brassinosteroid (BR) plays a dominant role in determining LA, and other phytohormones also positively or negatively participate in regulating LA. Accumulating evidences have revealed that these phytohormones interact with each other in modulating various biological processes. However, the comprehensive discussion of how the phytohormones and their interaction involved in shaping LA is relatively lack. Here, we intend to summarize the advances in the LA regulation mediated by the phytohormones and their crosstalk in different plant species, mainly in rice and maize, hopefully providing further insights into the genetic manipulation of LA trait in crop breeding and improvement in regarding to overcoming the challenge from the continuous demands for food under limited arable land area.
