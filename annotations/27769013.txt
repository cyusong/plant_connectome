Three studies were considered in which jasmonate-isoleucine levels were observed for several hours after plant wounding. The data from these studies were fitted to a first order kinetical model describing jasmonate-isoleucine complex formation and dissociation. It was found that the model could explain up to 97 percent of the variations in the data sets. In general, the data re-analysis confirmed that the protein-protein interactions involved in the biosynthesis and dissociation of the jasmonate-isoleucine complex are fast relative to the dynamics of the jasmonate levels themselves. Moreover, the data re-analysis supported the notion that transgenic plant manipulations affecting the defense-responses in plants not only affect the jasmonate-isoleucine levels indirectly by affecting jasmonate levels during plant responses. Rather, it seems that transgenic plant manipulations affect kinetic rate parameters of the jasmonate-isoleucine complex formation and dissociation reactions. In addition to these general findings, several specific conclusions for the three experimental studies were obtained.

wounding: !affects! jasmonate-isoleucine levels
transgenic plant manipulations: !affects! kinetic rate parameters
protein-protein interactions: !fast relative to! jasmonate levels
jasmonate-isoleucine complex formation: !represents! 97% of variations
