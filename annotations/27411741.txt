['27411741', 'UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) plays a major role in the diversity and reactivity  of plant specialized metabolites by catalyzing the transfer of the sugar moiety  from activated UDP-sugars to various acceptors. Arabidopsis UGT89A2 was  previously identified from a genome-wide association study as a key factor that  affects the differential accumulation of dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) glycosides  in distinct Arabidopsis natural accessions, including Col-0 and C24. The in vitro  enzyme assays indicate that these distinct metabolic phenotypes reflect the  divergence of UGT89A2 enzyme properties in the Col-0 and C24 accessions. UGT89A2  from Col-0 is highly selective toward UDP-xylose as the sugar donor, and the  isoform from C24 can utilize both UDP-glucose and UDP-xylose but with a higher  affinity to the glucose donor. The sequences of the two isozymes only differ at  six amino acid residues. Examination of these amino acid residues in more natural  accessions revealed a strong correlation between the amino acid polymorphism at  position 153 and the DHBA glycoside accumulation pattern. Site-directed  mutagenesis that swapped residue 153 between UGT89A2 from Col-0 and C24 reversed  the UDP-sugar preferences, indicating that residue 153 plays an important role in  determining sugar donor specificity of UGT89A2. This study provides insight into  the key amino acid changes that confer sugar donor selectivity on UGTs, and  demonstrates the usefulness of natural variation in understanding the  structure-function relationship of enzymes involved in specialized metabolism.', '2017 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13271', 'Li']
