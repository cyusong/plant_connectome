Rapid reconfigurations of interconnected phytohormone signalling networks allow plants to tune their physiology to constantly varying ecological conditions. During insect herbivory, most of the induced changes in defence-related leaf metabolites are controlled by jasmonate (JA) signalling, which, in the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata, recruits MYB8, a transcription factor controlling the accumulation of phenolic-polyamine conjugates (phenolamides). In this and other plant species, herbivory also locally triggers ethylene (ET) production but the outcome of the JA-ET cross-talk at the level of secondary metabolism regulation has remained only superficially investigated. Here, we analysed local and systemic herbivory-induced changes by mass spectrometry-based metabolomics in leaves of transgenic plants impaired in JA, ET and MYB8 signalling. Parsing deregulations in this factorial data-set identified a network of JA/MYB8-dependent phenolamides for which impairment of ET signalling attenuated their accumulation only in locally damaged leaves. Further experiments revealed that ET, albeit biochemically interrelated to polyamine metabolism via the intermediate S-adenosylmethionine, does not alter the free polyamine levels, but instead significantly modulates phenolamide levels with marginal modulations of transcript levels. The work identifies ET as a local modulator of phenolamide accumulations and provides a metabolomics data-platform with which to mine associations among herbivory-induced signalling and specialized metabolites in N. attenuata.
