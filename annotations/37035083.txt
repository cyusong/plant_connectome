<i>Pratylenchus thornei</i> is an economically important species of root-lesion nematode adversely affecting chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>) yields globally. Integration of resistant crops in farming systems is recognised as the most effective and sustainable management strategy for plant-parasitic nematodes. However, breeding for <i>P. thornei</i> resistance in chickpea is limited by the lack of genetic diversity. We deployed a genome-wide association approach to identify genomic regions and candidate genes associated with <i>P. thornei</i> resistance in 285 genetically diverse chickpea accessions. Chickpea accessions were phenotyped for <i>P. thornei</i> resistance in replicated glasshouse experiments performed for two years (2018 and 2020). Whole genome sequencing data comprising 492,849 SNPs were used to implement six multi-locus GWAS models. Fourteen chickpea genotypes were found to be resistant to <i>P. thornei</i>. Of the six multi-locus GWAS methods deployed, FASTmrMLM was found to be the best performing model. In all, 24 significant quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were identified, of which 13 QTNs were associated with lower nematode population density and 11 QTNs with higher nematode population density. These QTNs were distributed across all of the chickpea chromosomes, except chromosome 8. We identified, receptor-linked kinases (RLKs) on chromosomes 1, 4 and 6, GDSL-like Lipase/Acylhydrolase on chromosome 3, Aspartic proteinase-like and Thaumatin-like protein on chromosome 4, AT-hook DNA-binding and HSPRO2 on chromosome 6 as candidate genes for <i>P. thornei</i> resistance in the chickpea reference set. New sources of <i>P. thornei</i> resistant genotypes were identified that can be harnessed into breeding programs and putative candidate <i>P. thornei</i> resistant genes were identified that can be explored further to develop molecular markers and accelerate the incorporation of improved <i>P. thornei</i> resistance into elite chickpea cultivars.
