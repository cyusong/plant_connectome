['19923239', 'Genes encoding sterol ester-forming enzymes were recently identified in the  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome. One belongs to a family of six members  presenting homologies with the mammalian Lecithin Cholesterol Acyltransferases.  The other one belongs to the superfamily of Membrane-Bound O-Acyltransferases.  The physiological functions of these genes, Phospholipid Sterol Acyltransferase1  (PSAT1) and Acyl-CoA Sterol Acyltransferase1 (ASAT1), respectively, were  investigated using Arabidopsis mutants. Sterol ester content decreased in leaves  of all mutants and was strongly reduced in seeds from plants carrying a  PSAT1-deficient mutation. The amount of sterol esters in flowers was very close  to that of the wild type for all lines studied. This indicated further functional  redundancy of sterol acylation in Arabidopsis. We performed feeding experiments  in which we supplied sterol precursors to psat1-1, psat1-2, and asat1-1 mutants.  This triggered the accumulation of sterol esters (stored in cytosolic lipid  droplets) in the wild type and the asat1-1 lines but not in the psat1-1 and  psat1-2 lines, indicating a major contribution of the PSAT1 in maintaining free  sterol homeostasis in plant cell membranes. A clear biological effect associated  with the lack of sterol ester formation in the psat1-1 and psat1-2 mutants was an  early leaf senescence phenotype. Double mutants lacking PSAT1 and ASAT1 had  identical phenotypes to psat1 mutants. The results presented here suggest that  PSAT1 plays a role in lipid catabolism as part of the intracellular processes at  play in the maintenance of leaf viability during developmental aging.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.145672', 'Schaller']
