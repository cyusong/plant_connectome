<i>Bemisia tabaci</i> (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is one of the most important invasive pests worldwide. It infests several vegetables, legumes, fiber, and ornamental crops. Besides causing direct damage by sucking plant sap, <i>B. tabaci</i> is the principal vector of begomoviruses. <i>Chilli leaf curl virus</i> (ChiLCV<i>, Begomovirus</i>) transmitted by <i>B. tabaci</i> is a major constraint in chilli production. <i>B. tabaci</i> genes associated with metabolism, signaling pathways, cellular processes, and organismal systems are highly enriched in response to ChiLCV infection. The previous transcriptome study suggested the association of <i>B. tabaci Toll-like receptor 3</i> (<i>TLR3</i>) and <i>transducer of erbB2.1</i> (<i>TOB1</i>) in ChiLCV infection. In the present study, <i>B. tabaci TLR3</i> and <i>TOB1</i> were silenced using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the effect on fitness and begomovirus transmission has been reported. Oral delivery of dsRNA at 3 µg/mL reduced the expression of <i>B. tabaci TLR3</i> and <i>TOB1</i> by 6.77 and 3.01-fold, respectively. Silencing of <i>TLR3</i> and <i>TOB1</i> induced significant mortality in <i>B. tabaci</i> adults compared to untreated control. The ChiLCV copies in <i>B. tabaci</i> significantly reduced post-exposure to <i>TLR3</i> and <i>TOB1</i> dsRNAs. The ability of <i>B. tabaci</i> to transmit ChiLCV also declined post-silencing <i>TLR3</i> and <i>TOB1</i>. This is the first-ever report of silencing <i>B. tabaci TLR3</i> and <i>TOB1</i> to induce mortality and impair virus transmission ability in <i>B. tabaci</i>. <i>B. tabaci TLR3</i> and <i>TOB1</i> would be novel genetic targets to manage <i>B. tabaci</i> and restrict the spread of begomovirus.
