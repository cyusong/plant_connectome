In barley (Hordeum vulgare), PHOTOPERIOD1 (Ppd-H1) acts as a major positive regulator of flowering under long-day conditions, while VERNALIZATION2 (VRN-H2) is a strong repressor of flowering under long days before vernalization. By contrast, CONSTANS (CO) plays a key role in the photoperiodic regulation of flowering in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we study the role of the closest barley CO homologs, HvCO1 and HvCO2, in the long day-dependent control of flowering and their interactions with Ppd-H1 and VRN-H2. HvCO2 overexpression in spring barley, with a natural deletion of the VRN-H2 locus, caused a Ppd-H1-dependent induction of flowering and FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (HvFT1) expression. In winter barley, which carries the VRN-H2 locus, overexpression of HvCO1/CO2 caused an up-regulation of VRN-H2, resulting in a reduced expression of HvFT1 and delayed flowering under long- and short-day conditions. In addition, natural variation at Ppd-H1 altered the expression of VRN-H2 in wild-type plants under long days. VRN-H2, in turn, was involved in the down-regulation of Ppd-H1 and HvCO2, demonstrating strong reciprocal interactions between HvCO2, Ppd-H1, and VRN-H2. Consequently, this study showed that the induction of the floral repressor VRN-H2 and the floral activator HvFT1 was regulated by the same genes, Ppd-H1 and HvCO1/CO2. Our findings provide a novel insight into the photoperiodic regulation of the vernalization pathway in barley.
