Cellulose is one of the most abundant biopolymers on Earth. It provides mechanical support to growing plant cells and important raw materials for paper, textiles and biofuel feedstocks. Cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors (CBIs) are invaluable tools for studying cellulose biosynthesis and can be important herbicides for controlling weed growth. Here, we review CBIs with particular focus on the most widely used CBIs and recently discovered CBIs. We discuss the effects of these CBIs on plant growth and development and plant cell biology and summarize what is known about the mode of action of these different CBIs.
