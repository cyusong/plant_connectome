When seedlings of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cvs. Malviya-36 and Pant-12 were raised under 25 and 50 microM As2O3 in the medium an increase in the level of RNA, proteins and proline accompanied with a decline in the level of free amino acid pool was observed under arsenic supplementation compared to controls. In situ As3+ treatment caused a marked inhibition in activities of ribonuclease (RNase, EC 3.1.27.1), protease and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP, EC 3.4.11.1) whereas the activity level of carboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.16.5) was enhanced. In vitro supply of As2O3 in the enzyme assay medium beyond 400 microM resulted in gradual inhibition of RNase and beyond 5 microM inhibition of LAP activities. Addition of 1M proline in the assay medium significantly restored the loss in RNase activity due to in vitro arsenic treatment or due to osmotic stress created by incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Isoform pattern of RNase extracted from As3+ -exposed seedlings showed a significant alteration compared to its pattern in unexposed seedlings. Results suggest that arsenic exposure impairs hydrolysis of RNA and proteins in rice seedlings due to inhibition of RNase and proteases activities and that proline accumulating under As3+ toxicity appears to serve as enzyme protectant.
