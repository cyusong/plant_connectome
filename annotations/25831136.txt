Plants respond to limited soil nutrient availability by inducing more lateral roots (LR) to increase the root surface area. At the cellular level, nutrient starvation triggers the process of autophagy through which bulk degradation of cellular materials is achieved to facilitate nutrient mobilization. Whether there is any link between the cellular autophagy and induction of LR had remained unknown. We recently showed that the S-Domain receptor Kinase (ARK2) and U Box/Armadillo Repeat-Containing E3 ligase (PUB9) module is required for lateral root formation under phosphate starvation in Arabidopsis thaliana.(1) We also showed that PUB9 localized to autophagic bodies following either activation by ARK2 or under phosphate starvation and ark2-1/pub9-1 plants displayed lateral root defects with inability to accumulate auxin in the root tips under phosphate starvation.(1) Supplementing exogenous auxin was sufficient to rescue the LR defects in ark2-1/pub9-1 mutant. Blocking of autophagic responses in wild-type Arabidopsis also resulted in inhibition of both lateral roots and auxin accumulation in the root tips indicating the importance of autophagy in mediating auxin accumulation under phosphate starved conditions.(1) Here, we propose a model for ARK2/AtPUB9 module in regulation of lateral root development via selective autophagy.

ARK2: !activates! PUB9
PUB9: !localizes to! Autophagic bodies
ARK2/AtPUB9: !regulates! Lateral root development
Autophagy: !mediates! Auxin accumulation
Auxin: !rescues! LR defects in ark2-1/pub9-1 mutant
