Flowering is a developmental process, which is influenced by chemical and environmental stimuli. Recently, our research established that the Arabidopsis SUMO E3 ligase, AtSIZ1, is a negative regulator of transition to flowering through mechanisms that reduce salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and involve SUMO modification of FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD). FLD is an autonomous pathway determinant that represses the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a floral repressor. This addendum postulates mechanisms by which SIZ1-mediated SUMO conjugation regulates SA accumulation and FLD activity.

AtSIZ1: !regulates! Transition to flowering
AtSIZ1: !reduces! SA accumulation
FLD: !represses! FLC expression
SIZ1-mediated SUMO conjugation: !regulates! SA accumulation
SIZ1-mediated SUMO conjugation: !regulates! FLD activity
