Silicon (Si) is known to stimulate plant resistance against different phytopathogens, i.e., bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. It is an efficient plant growth regulator under various biotic and abiotic stresses. Silicon-containing compounds, including silicon dioxide, SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (NPs), nano-chelated silicon fertilizer (NCSF), sodium siliconate, and sodium metasilicate, are effective in damaging various nematodes that reduce their reproduction, galling, and disease severity. The defence mechanisms in plant-nematodes interaction may involve a physical barrier, plant defence-associated enzyme activity, synthesis of antimicrobial compounds, and transcriptional regulation of defence-related genes. In the current review, we focused on silicon and its compounds in controlling plant nematodes and regulating different defence mechanisms involved in plant-nematodes interaction. Furthermore, the review aims to evaluate the potential role of Si application in improving plant resistance against nematodes and highlight its need for efficient plant-nematodes disease management.
