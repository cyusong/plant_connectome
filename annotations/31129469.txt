Control of gene expression and induction of cellular protection mechanisms are two important processes that plants employ to protect themselves against abiotic stresses. ABA-, stress, and ripening-induced (ASR) proteins have been identified to participate in such responses. Previous studies have proposed that these proteins can act as transcription factors and as molecular chaperones protecting transgenic plants against stresses; however a gene network regulated by ASRs has not been explored. To expand our knowledge on the function of these proteins in cereals, we present the functional characterization of a barley ASR gene. Expression of HvASR5 was almost ubiquitous in different organs and responded to ABA and to different stress treatments. When expressed ectopically, HvASR5 was able to confer drought and salt stress tolerance to Arabidopsis thaliana and to improve growth performance of rice plants under stress conditions. A transcriptomic analysis with two transgenic rice lines overexpressing HvASR5 helped to identify potential downstream targets and understand ASR-regulated cellular processes. HvASR5 up-regulated the expression of a distinct set of genes associated with stress responses, metabolic processes (particularly carbohydrate metabolism), as well as reproduction and development. These data, together with the confirmed nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of HvASR5, further support the hypothesis that HvASR5 can also carry out roles as molecular protector and transcriptional regulator.
