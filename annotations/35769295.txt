Crop wild relatives represent valuable reservoirs of variation for breeding, but their populations are threatened in natural habitats, are sparsely represented in genebanks, and most are poorly characterized. The focus of this study is the <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> species complex (<i>ORSC</i>), wild progenitor of Asian rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.). The <i>ORSC</i> comprises perennial, annual and intermediate forms which were historically designated as <i>O. rufipogon, O. nivara</i>, and <i>O. sativa</i> f. <i>spontanea</i> (or <i>Oryza</i> spp., an annual form of mixed <i>O. rufipogon/O. nivara</i> and <i>O. sativa</i> ancestry), respectively, based on non-standardized morphological, geographical, and/or ecologically-based species definitions and boundaries. Here, a collection of 240 diverse <i>ORSC</i> accessions, characterized by genotyping-by-sequencing (113,739 SNPs), was phenotyped for 44 traits associated with plant, panicle, and seed morphology in the screenhouse at the International Rice Research Institute, Philippines. These traits included heritable phenotypes often recorded as characterization data by genebanks. Over 100 of these <i>ORSC</i> accessions were also phenotyped in the greenhouse for 18 traits in Stuttgart, Arkansas, and 16 traits in Ithaca, New York, United States. We implemented a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model to infer accession groups from a subset of these phenotypic data and ascertained three phenotype-based group assignments. We used concordance between the genotypic subpopulations and these phenotype-based groups to identify a suite of phenotypic traits that could reliably differentiate the <i>ORSC</i> populations, whether measured in tropical or temperate regions. The traits provide insight into plant morphology, life history (perenniality versus annuality) and mating habit (self- versus cross-pollinated), and are largely consistent with genebank species designations. One phenotypic group contains predominantly <i>O. rufipogon</i> accessions characterized as perennial and largely out-crossing and one contains predominantly <i>O. nivara</i> accessions characterized as annual and largely inbreeding. From these groups, 42 "core" <i>O. rufipogon</i> and 25 "core" <i>O. nivara</i> accessions were identified for domestication studies. The third group, comprising 20% of our collection, has the most accessions identified as <i>Oryza</i> spp. (51.2%) and levels of <i>O. sativa</i> admixture accounting for more than 50% of the genome. This third group is potentially useful as a "pre-breeding" pool for breeders attempting to incorporate novel variation into elite breeding lines.
