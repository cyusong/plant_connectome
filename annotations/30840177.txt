This study shows that NgRBP suppresses both local and systemic RNA silencing induced by sense- or double-stranded RNA, and the RNA binding activity is essential for its function. To counteract host defence, many plant viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing targeting various stages of RNA silencing. There is increasing evidence that the plants also encode endogenous suppressors of RNA silencing (ESR) to regulate this pathway. In this study, using Agrobacterium infiltration assays, we characterized NgRBP, a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein from Nicotiana glutinosa, as an ESR. Our results indicated that NgRBP suppressed both local and systemic RNA silencing induced by sense- or double-stranded RNA. We also demonstrated that NgRBP could promote Potato Virus X (PVX) infection in N. benthamiana. NgRBP knockdown by virus-induced gene silencing enhanced PVX and Cucumber mosaic virus resistance in N. glutinosa. RNA immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that NgRBP bound to GFP mRNA, dsRNA rather than siRNA. These findings provide the evidence that NgRBP acts as an ESR and the RNA affinity of NgRBP plays the key role in its ESR activity. NgRBP responds to multiple signals such as ABA, MeJA, SA, and Tobacco mosaic virus infection. Therefore, it could participate in the regulation of gene expression under specific conditions.
