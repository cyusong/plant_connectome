['28541511', 'The plant hormone ethylene affects many biological processes during plant growth  and development. Ethylene is perceived by ethylene receptors at the endoplasmic  reticulum (ER) membrane. The ETR1 ethylene receptor is positively regulated by  the transmembrane protein RTE1, which localizes to the ER and Golgi apparatus.  The RTE1 gene family is conserved in animals, plants, and lower eukaryotes. In  Arabidopsis, RTE1-HOMOLOG (RTH) is the only homolog of the Arabidopsis RTE1 gene  family. The regulatory function of the Arabidopsis RTH in ethylene signaling and  plant growth is largely unknown. The present study shows Arabidopsis RTH gene  expression patterns, protein co-localization with the ER and Golgi apparatus, and  the altered ethylene response phenotype when RTH is knocked out or overexpressed  in Arabidopsis. Compared with rte1 mutants, rth mutants exhibit less sensitivity  to exogenous ethylene, while RTH overexpression confers ethylene  hypersensitivity. Genetic analyses indicate that Arabidopsis RTH might not  directly regulate the ethylene receptors. RTH can physically interact with RTE1,  and evidence supports that RTH might act via RTE1 in regulating ethylene  responses and signaling. The present study advances our understanding of the  regulatory function of the Arabidopsis RTE1 gene family members in ethylene  signaling.', '2017 May 17', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erx175', 'Dong']
