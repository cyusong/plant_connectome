['9492312', 'The addition of phytyl side chain to chlorophylls, tocopherols and phylloquinone  is prerequisite to their integration into plastid membranes. We have cloned a  cDNA encoding a pre-geranylgeranyl reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana. The  deduced primary structure predicts a mature size with a molecular mass of 47 kDa  and displays a characteristic dinucleotide binding domain. Geranylgeranyl  reductase expressed in Escherichia coli sequentially catalyzes the reduction of  geranylgeranyl-chlorophyll a into phytyl-chlorophyll a as well as the reduction  of free geranylgeranyl diphosphate into phytyl diphosphate. Due to its  multifunctionality and weak hydrophobicity, we suggest that in plastid the same  geranylgeranyl reductase is recruited into the chlorophyll, the tocopherol and  the phylloquinone pathways. The geranylgeranyl reductase gene is up-regulated  during etioplast to chloroplast and chloroplast to chromoplast development.', '1998 Jan 15', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2510413.x', 'Camara']
