['26358416', 'Pollen tube growth is an essential aspect of plant reproduction because it is the  mechanism through which nonmotile sperm cells are delivered to ovules, thus  allowing fertilization to occur. A pollen tube is a single cell that only grows  at the tip, and this tip growth has been shown to depend on actin filaments. It  is generally assumed that myosin-driven movements along these actin filaments are  required to sustain the high growth rates of pollen tubes. We tested this  conjecture by examining seed set, pollen fitness, and pollen tube growth for  knockout mutants of five of the six myosin XI genes expressed in pollen of  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Single mutants had little or no reduction in  overall fertility, whereas double mutants of highly similar pollen myosins had  greater defects in pollen tube growth. In particular, myo11c1 myo11c2 pollen  tubes grew more slowly than wild-type pollen tubes, which resulted in reduced  fitness compared with the wild type and a drastic reduction in seed set. Golgi  stack and peroxisome movements were also significantly reduced, and actin  filaments were less organized in myo11c1 myo11c2 pollen tubes. Interestingly, the  movement of yellow fluorescent protein-RabA4d-labeled vesicles and their  accumulation at pollen tube tips were not affected in the myo11c1 myo11c2 double  mutant, demonstrating functional specialization among myosin isoforms. We  conclude that class XI myosins are required for organelle motility, actin  organization, and optimal growth of pollen tubes.', '2015 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.01161', 'Nebenfuhr']
