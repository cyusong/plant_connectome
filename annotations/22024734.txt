Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), an important enzyme of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, is involved in salt tolerance of plants through scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, a cDNA encoding MDHAR from the mangrove plant Acanthus ebracteatus was introduced into rice to examine its role in salt tolerance. Three stable transgenic lines (MT22, MT24 and MT25) overexpressing AeMDHAR were selected in vitro using hygromycin and confirmed by PCR, quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT) PCR and enzyme assay. The transgenic line MT24 was predicted to possess a single copy of the transgene while the other two transgenic lines were predicted to have multiple transgene integrations. The AeMDHAR transcripts were detected only in transgenic rice lines but not in untransformed rice. The abundance of AeMDHAR transcripts in transgenic lines MT22 and MT25 was approximately 2.75 times the amount found in MT24. The transgenic rice lines overexpressing AeMDHAR showed a significant increase in MDHAR enzyme activity compared to untransformed plants under both NaCl and control conditions. All transgenic lines showed better yield attributes such as a higher tiller number and increased 1000-grain weight compared to non-transgenics. They also showed tolerance to salt at germination and seedling stages. The transgenic line MT24, which harbors a single copy of AeMDHAR, displayed a lower rate of sterility, a higher number of tillers and longer panicle compared to untransformed plants when subjected to salt stress.
