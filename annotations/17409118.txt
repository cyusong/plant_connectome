A recent Keystone Symposium on 'MicroRNAs and siRNAs: Biological Functions and Mechanisms' was organized by David Bartel and Shiv Grewal (and was held in conjunction with 'RNAi for Target Validation and as a Therapeutic', organized by Stephen Friend and John Maraganore). The 'MicroRNAs and siRNAs' meeting brought together scientists working on diverse biological aspects of small regulatory RNAs, including microRNAs, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs and rasiRNAs). Among the themes discussed were the diversity of small regulatory RNAs and their developmental functions, their biogenesis, the identification of their regulatory targets, their mechanisms of action, and their roles in the elaboration of multicellular complexity.
