Rhizobia are soil bacteria that can establish a symbiotic association with legumes. As a result, plant nodules are formed on the roots of the host plants where rhizobia differentiate to bacteroids capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia. This ammonia is transferred to the plant in exchange of a carbon source and an appropriate environment for bacterial survival. This process is subjected to a tight regulation with several checkpoints to allow the progression of the infection or its restriction. The type 3 secretion system (T3SS) is a secretory system that injects proteins, called effectors (T3E), directly into the cytoplasm of the host cell, altering host pathways or suppressing host defense responses. This secretion system is not present in all rhizobia but its role in symbiosis is crucial for some symbiotic associations, showing two possible faces as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: it can be completely necessary for the formation of nodules, or it can block nodulation in different legume species/cultivars. In this review, we compile all the information currently available about the effects of different rhizobial effectors on plant symbiotic phenotypes. These phenotypes are diverse and highlight the importance of the T3SS in certain rhizobium-legume symbioses.
