To quantify stem respiration (R<sub>S</sub> ) under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub> ), stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux (E<sub>A</sub> ) and CO<sub>2</sub> flux through the xylem (F<sub>T</sub> ) should be accounted for, because part of respired CO<sub>2</sub> is transported upwards with the sap solution. However, previous studies have used E<sub>A</sub> as a proxy of R<sub>S</sub> , which could lead to equivocal conclusions. Here, to test the effect of eCO<sub>2</sub> on R<sub>S</sub> , both E<sub>A</sub> and F<sub>T</sub> were measured in a free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiment located in a mature Eucalyptus native forest. Drought stress substantially reduced E<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>S</sub> , which were unaffected by eCO<sub>2</sub> , likely as a consequence of its neutral effect on stem growth in this phosphorus-limited site. However, xylem CO<sub>2</sub> concentration measured near the stem base was higher under eCO<sub>2</sub> , and decreased along the stem resulting in a negative contribution of F<sub>T</sub> to R<sub>S</sub> , whereas the contribution of F<sub>T</sub> to R<sub>S</sub> under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> was positive. Negative F<sub>T</sub> indicates net efflux of CO<sub>2</sub> respired below the monitored stem segment, likely coming from the roots. Our results highlight the role of nutrient availability on the dependency of R<sub>S</sub> on eCO<sub>2</sub> and suggest stimulated root respiration under eCO<sub>2</sub> that may shift vertical gradients in xylem [CO<sub>2</sub> ] confounding the interpretation of E<sub>A</sub> measurements.
