['11867638', 'E2F transcription factors are major regulators of cell proliferation, and each  factor contributes differently to cell cycle control. Arabidopsis contains six  E2F homologs, of which three are proteins that exhibit an overall similarity to  animal E2Fs and interact with DPa and DPb to stimulate DNA binding. Here we  describe the other three E2F-like proteins from Arabidopsis, E2L1-3, which have  two copies of a domain with a limited similarity only to the DNA binding domain  of E2F. Unlike known E2Fs, the three E2L proteins failed to interact with DPa and  DPb and could efficiently bind E2F sites in a monomeric form through the  dual-type domain. Transfection assays revealed that E2Ls repress the  transcription of reporter genes under the control of E2F-regulated promoters,  indicating that E2Ls function to antagonize transactivation mediated by E2F.DP.  When fused to green fluorescence protein, E2L1 and E2L3 were predominantly  localized to the nucleus whereas E2L2 was detected in both the nucleus and  cytoplasm. Because the transcripts of E2Ls were abundant in meristematic rather  than fully differentiated tissues, E2Ls may balance the activities of E2F.DP and  play a role in restraining cell proliferation.', '2002 May 10', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M200913200', 'Ohashi']
