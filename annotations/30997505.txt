Plants adjust their photosynthetic capacity in response to their environment in a way that optimizes their yield and fitness. There is growing evidence that this acclimation is a response to changes in the leaf metabolome, but the extent to which these are linked and how this is optimized remain poorly understood. Using as an example the metabolic perturbations occurring in response to cold, we define the different stages required for acclimation, discuss the evidence for a metabolic temperature sensor, and suggest further work towards designing climate-smart crops. In particular, we discuss how constraint-based and kinetic metabolic modelling approaches can be used to generate targeted hypotheses about relevant pathways, and argue that a stronger integration of experimental and in silico studies will help us to understand the tightly regulated interplay of carbon partitioning and resource allocation required for photosynthetic acclimation to different environmental conditions.
