Members of the P4 subfamily of P-type ATPases are implicated in generating lipid asymmetry between the two lipid leaflets of the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis and are important for resistance to low temperatures, but the function of P4-ATPases in cotton remains unclear. In this study, we found using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis that the expression of the P4-ATPase gene GbPATP in cotton was induced at low temperatures. In addition, GbPATP-silenced cotton plants were more sensitive to low temperatures and exhibited greater malondialdehyde (MDA) content and lower catalase (CAT) activity than the control plants. GbPATP transgenic tobacco plants showed better chilling tolerance, had a lower MDA content and had higher CAT activity than wild-type plants under low-temperature treatment. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-GbPATP fusion protein was found to be localized to the cell plasma membrane. Collectively, the results suggest that GbPATP functions as a P4-ATPase and plays an important role in improving chilling tolerance in plant.
