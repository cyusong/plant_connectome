Nitrate transporter 2.5 (NRT2.5) was originally characterized as the transporter for nitrogen (N) limitation. In <i>Arabidopsis, NRT2.5</i> is expressed mainly under extremely low NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and N starvation conditions, and this must work in conjunction with NAR2.1. <i>NRT2.5</i> is expressed both in the roots and leaves in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, poplars, tea trees and cassava. This is also expressed in the seeds of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and wheat. In wheat, <i>NRT2.5</i> is expressed in the embryo and shell and plays a role in the accumulation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the seeds. In maize, this is also expressed in silk, cobs and tassel husk leaves. In rice, <i>OsNRT2.5</i> (also known as <i>OsNRT2.3a</i>) may help the species to remove NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> from the roots to shoots. In addition, <i>NRT2.5</i> may interact with <i>TGA3, MYC1, LBD37, LBD38, TaNAC2</i> and other transcription factors and participate in the transmission of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> signals. The present review summarizes the functions of NRT2.5 in different plant species, which may help plant breeders and molecular biologists to improve crop yield. <b>Abbreviations:</b> NRT, Nitrate transporter; NUE, nitrogen use efficiency; PTR, peptide transporter; NPF, nitrate peptide transporter family; CLC, chloride channel; LAC1/SLAH, slow anion channel-associated 1 homolog 3; LATS, low-affinity transporter systems; HATS, high-affinity transport systems; NNP, nitrate-nitrite-porter; MFS, major facilitator superfamily.
