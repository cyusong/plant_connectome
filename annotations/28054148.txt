Different nitrogen forms affect different metabolic pathways in lichens. In particular, the most relevant changes in protein expression were observed in the fungal partner, with NO <sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> mostly affecting the energetic metabolism and NH <sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> affecting transport and regulation of proteins and the energetic metabolism much more than NO <sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> did. Excess deposition of reactive nitrogen is a well-known agent of stress for lichens, but which symbiont is most affected and how, remains a mystery. Using proteomics can expand our understanding of stress effects on lichens. We investigated the effects of different doses and forms of reactive nitrogen, with and without supplementary phosphorus and potassium, on the proteome of the lichen Cladonia portentosa growing in a 'real-world' simulation of nitrogen deposition. Protein expression changed with the nitrogen treatments but mostly in the fungal partner, with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> mainly affecting the energetic metabolism and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> also affecting the protein synthesis machinery. The photobiont mainly responded overexpressing proteins involved in energy production. This suggests that in response to nitrogen stress, the photobiont mainly supports the defensive mechanisms initiated by the mycobiont with an increased energy production. Such surplus energy is then used by the cell to maintain functionality in the presence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, while a futile cycle of protein production can be hypothesized to be induced by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> excess. External supply of potassium and phosphorus influenced differently the responses of particular enzymes, likely reflecting the many processes in which potassium exerts a regulatory function.
