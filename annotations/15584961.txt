['15584961', 'Powdery mildews and other obligate biotrophic pathogens are highly adapted to  their hosts and often show limited host ranges. One facet of such host  specialization is likely to be penetration of the host cell wall, a major barrier  to infection. A mutation in the pmr5 gene rendered Arabidopsis resistant to the  powdery mildew species Erysiphe cichoracearum and Erysiphe orontii, but not to  the unrelated pathogens Pseudomonas syringae or Peronospora parasitica. PMR5  belongs to a large family of plant-specific genes of unknown function.  pmr5-mediated resistance did not require signaling through either the salicylic  acid or jasmonic acid/ethylene defense pathways, suggesting resistance in this  mutant may be due either to the loss of a susceptibility factor or to the  activation of a novel form of defense. Based on Fourier transform infrared  analysis, the pmr5 cell walls were enriched in pectin and exhibited a reduced  degree of pectin modification relative to wild-type cell walls. In addition, the  mutant had smaller cells, suggesting a defect in cell expansion. A double mutant  with pmr6 (defective in a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored pectate  lyase-like gene) exhibited a strong increase in total uronic acid content and a  more severe reduction in size, relative to the single mutants, suggesting that  the two genes affect pectin composition, either directly or indirectly, via  different mechanisms. These two mutants highlight the importance of the host cell  wall in plant-microbe interactions.', '2004 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02264.x', 'Somerville']
