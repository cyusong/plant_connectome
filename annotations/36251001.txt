The gray leaf spots caused by <i>Cercospora</i> spp. severely affect the yield and quality of maize. However, the evolutionary relation and pathogenicity variation between species of the <i>Cercospora</i> genus is largely unknown. In this study, we constructed high-quality reference genomes by nanopore sequencing two <i>Cercospora</i> species, namely, <i>C. zeae-maydis</i> and <i>C. zeina</i>, with differing pathogenicity, collected from northeast (Liaoning [LN]) and southeast (Yunnan [YN]) China, respectively. The genome size of <i>C. zeae-maydis</i>-LN is 45.08 Mb, containing 10,839 annotated genes, whereas that of <i>Cercospora zeina</i>-YN is 42.18 Mb, containing 10,867 annotated genes, of which approximately 86.58% are common in the two species. The difference in their genome size is largely attributed to increased long terminal repeat retrotransposons of 3.8 Mb in total length in <i>C. zeae-maydis</i>-LN. There are 41 and 30 carbohydrate-binding gene subfamilies identified in <i>C. zeae-maydis</i>-LN and <i>C. zeina</i>-YN, respectively. A higher number of carbohydrate-binding families found in <i>C. zeae-maydis</i>-LN, and its unique CBM4, CBM37, and CBM66, in particular, may contribute to variation in pathogenicity between the two species, as the carbohydrate-binding genes are known to encode cell wall-degrading enzymes. Moreover, there are 114 and 107 effectors predicted, with 47 and 46 having unique potential pathogenicity in <i>C. zeae-maydis</i>-LN and <i>C. zeina</i>-YN, respectively. Of eight effectors randomly selected for pathogenic testing, five were found to inhibit cell apoptosis induced by Bcl-2-associated X. Taken together, our results provide genomic insights into variation in pathogenicity between <i>C. zeae-maydis</i> and <i>C. zeina</i>. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).
