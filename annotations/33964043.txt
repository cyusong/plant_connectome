Brassinosteroids (BRs) are pivotal phytohormones involved in the control of root development. Boron (B) is an essential micronutrient for plants, and root growth is rapidly inhibited under B deficiency conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying this inhibition are still unclear. Here, we identified BR-related processes underlying B deficiency at the physiological, genetic, molecular/cell biological and transcriptomic levels and found strong evidence that B deficiency can affect BR biosynthesis and signalling, thereby altering root growth. RNA sequencing analysis revealed strong co-regulation between BR-regulated genes and B deficiency-responsive genes. We found that the BR receptor mutants bri1-119 and bri1-301 were more insensitive to decreased B supply, and the gain-of-function mutants bes1-D and pBZR1-bzr1-D exhibited insensitivity to low-B stress. Under B deficiency conditions, exogenous 24-epibrassinolide rescued the inhibition of root growth, and application of the BR biosynthesis inhibitor brassinazole exacerbated this inhibitory effect. The nuclear-localised signal of BES1 was reduced under low-B conditions compared with B sufficiency conditions. We further found that B deficiency hindered the accumulation of brassinolide to downregulate BR signalling and modulate root elongation, which may occur through a reduction in BR6ox1 and BR6ox2 mRNA levels. Taken together, our results reveal a role of BR signalling in root elongation under B deficiency.
