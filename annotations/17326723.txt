['17326723', 'In flowering plants, the egg and sperm cells form within haploid gametophytes.  The female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consists of two gametic cells, the egg cell  and the central cell, which are flanked by five accessory cells. Both gametic and  accessory cells are vital for fertilization; however, the mechanisms that  underlie the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate are unknown. In a  screen for regulators of egg cell fate, we isolated the lachesis (lis) mutant  which forms supernumerary egg cells. In lis mutants, accessory cells  differentiate gametic cell fate, indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism  that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate. The temporal and  spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in  gametic cells. LIS is homologous to the yeast splicing factor PRP4, indicating  that components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions.', '2007 Mar', 'PLoS Biol', '10.1371/journal.pbio.0050047', 'Grossniklaus']
