Sucrose and auxin are well-known determinants of root system architecture (RSA). However, the factors that connect the signaling pathways evoked by these two critical factors during root development are poorly understood. In this study, we report the role of MEDIATOR SUBUNIT17 (MED17) in RSA and its involvement in the transcriptional integration of sugar and auxin signaling pathways in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Sucrose regulates root meristem activation through the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN-E2 PROMOTER BINDING FACTOR A TOR-E2FA pathway, and auxin regulates lateral root (LR) development through AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR-LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN ARF-LBDs. Both sucrose and auxin play a vital role during primary and LR development. However, there is no clarity on how sucrose is involved in the ARF-dependent regulation of auxin-responsive genes. This study establishes MED17 as a nodal point to connect sucrose and auxin signaling. Transcription of MED17 was induced by sucrose in an E2FA/B-dependent manner. Moreover, E2FA/B interacted with MED17, which can aid in the recruitment of the Mediator complex on the target promoters. Interestingly, E2FA/B and MED17 also occupied the promoter of ARF7, but not ARF19, leading to ARF7 expression, which then activates auxin signaling and thus initiates LR development. MED17 also activated cell division in the root meristem by occupying the promoters of cell-cycle genes, thus regulating their transcription. Thus, MED17 plays an important role in relaying the transcriptional signal from sucrose to auxin-responsive and cell-cycle genes to regulate primary and lateral root development, highlighting the role of the Mediator as the transcriptional processor for optimal root system architecture in Arabidopsis.
