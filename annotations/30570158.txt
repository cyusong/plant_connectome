Abscisic acid-insensitive 5 (ABI5) is an essential and conserved plant basic leucine zipper transcription factor whose level controls seed germination and postgerminative development. It has been demonstrated that activity of ABI5 is transcriptionally and post-translationally regulated. However, transcriptional regulation of ABI5 is not fully understood. Here, we identified SAB1 (Sensitive to ABA 1) as a novel negative regulator of ABI5 that simultaneously regulates its stability, promoter binding activity and histone methylation-mediated gene silencing of ABI5. SAB1 encodes a Regulator of Chromatin Condensation 1 (RCC1) family protein and is expressed in an opposite pattern to that of ABI5 during early seedling growth in response to abscisic acid (ABA). SAB1 mutation results in enhanced ABA sensitivity and acts upstream of ABI5. SAB1 physically interacts with ABI5 at phosphoamino acid Ser-145, and reduces the phosphorylation of ABI5 and the protein stability. SAB1 reduces ABI5 binding activity to its own promoter, leading to reduced transcriptional level of ABI5. SAB1 inactivates ABI5 transcription by increasing the level of histone H3K27me2 in the ABI5 promoter. Our findings have identified SAB1 as a crucial new component of ABA signaling which modulates early development of plant by precisely controlling ABI5 activity through multiple mechanisms.
