['14988493', 'Multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBF1) is known to be a transcriptional  co-activator that mediates transcriptional activation by bridging between an  activator and a TATA-box binding protein (TBP). We demonstrated that expression  of every three MBF1 from Arabidopsis partially rescues the yeast mbf1 mutant  phenotype, indicating that all of them function as co-activators for  GCN4-dependent transcriptional activation. We also report that each of their  subtypes shows distinct tissue-specific expression patterns and responses to  phytohormones. These observations suggest that even though they share a similar  biochemical function, each MBF1 has distinct roles in various tissues and  conditions.', '2004 Feb', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pch017', 'Yamazaki']
