['19527719', 'In Arabidopsis, there are at least seven class I acylhydrolase members, which  have a putative N-terminal chloroplast-targeting signal. Here, we show that all  seven class I proteins are localized to the chloroplasts and hydrolyze  phosphatidylcholine at the sn-1 position. However, based on their activities  toward various lipids, Arabidopsis class I enzymes could be further divided into  three sub-groups by substrate specificity, one with phospholipase-specific  activity, another with phospholipase and galactolipase activities, and the other  with broad lipolytic activity toward phosphatidylcholine, galactolipids, and  triacylglycerol. These results suggest that the three sub-groups of class I  acylhydrolases have specific roles in chloroplasts.', '2009 Jul 7', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2009.06.021', 'Kim']
