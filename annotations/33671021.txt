The peroxisome is a single-membrane subcellular compartment present in almost all eukaryotic cells from simple protists and fungi to complex organisms such as higher plants and animals. Historically, the name of the peroxisome came from a subcellular structure that contained high levels of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and the antioxidant enzyme catalase, which indicated that this organelle had basically an oxidative metabolism. During the last 20 years, it has been shown that plant peroxisomes also contain nitric oxide (NO), a radical molecule than leads to a family of derived molecules designated as reactive nitrogen species (RNS). These reactive species can mediate post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, such as <i>S</i>-nitrosation and tyrosine nitration, thus affecting their function. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how NO could affect peroxisomal metabolism and its internal protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Remarkably, many of the identified NO-target proteins in plant peroxisomes are involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS), either in its generation or its scavenging. Therefore, it is proposed that NO is a molecule with signaling properties with the capacity to modulate the peroxisomal protein-protein network and consequently the peroxisomal functions, especially under adverse environmental conditions.
