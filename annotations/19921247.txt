In Arabidopsis thaliana, de-etiolated 1 mutants (det1) grown in the dark resemble light-grown wild-type seedlings. Arabidopsis DET1 encodes a 62 kD protein, which is a negative regulator of light signaling. UV-damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1) was initially identified due to its role in human DNA damage repair. Arabidopsis has two DDB1 homologs: DDB1A and DDB1B. DDB1A mutation enhances det1 mutant phenotypes. In this study, we generated Arabidopsis lines that overexpress DDB1A-3HA in wild-type, det1, as well as Myc-DET1 or GFP-DET1 rescued genetic backgrounds. DDB1A-3HA overexpression resulted in decreased apical hook formation in wild-type dark-grown seedlings, and enhanced det1 small rosette and early flowering time phenotypes. In the Myc-DET1 background, DDB1A-3HA overexpression resulted in decreased rescue of dark- and light-grown hypocotyl length, light-grown anthocyanin and chlorophyll levels, adult height and stem number phenotypes. This result is consistent with the decreased levels of Myc-DET1 protein detected in the DDB1A-3HA overexpression line. The GFP-DET1 DDB1A-3HA double overexpression line exhibited increased rescue of dark and light-grown hypocotyl length and light-grown chlorophyll level phenotypes relative to GFP-DET1 alone, despite the fact that GFP-DET1 protein also decreased in the double overexpression line. In addition, increased DET1 resulted in decreased DDB1A-3HA levels due to proteasomal degradation. Overall, DDB1A-3HA overexpression affected phenotypes in a variety of DET1 backgrounds, reduced epitope-tagged DET1 levels, and, correlatively, in general dampened the rescue of det1 mutants by the DET1-DDB1A complex.
