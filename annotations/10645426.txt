['10645426', 'The SPINDLY (SPY) locus of Arabidopsis thaliana is believed to be involved in  gibberellin (GA) signal transduction. The six known mutations at this locus cause  a phenotype that is consistent with constitutive activation of the GA signal  transduction pathway. spy alleles are epistatic to gai, a mutation conferring  gibberellin-insensitivity, indicating that SPY acts as a negative regulator of GA  signal transduction, downstream of GAI. SPY was cloned using a T-DNA insertion in  the spy-4 allele. SPY encodes a 914 amino acid protein with an N-terminal TPR  region (a likely protein-protein interaction domain) and a novel C-terminal  domain. The spy mutants show that both the N- and C-terminal domains of SPY are  functionally important, spy-4 is likely to be a null allele and displays some  morphological defects not seen in the other alleles. A 35S:SPY construct rescues  the spy mutant phenotype, but does not show any gain-of-function SPY phenotypes.  Smaller constructs overexpressing different domains of the SPY protein have no  effect on plant development.', '1998', 'Symp Soc Exp Biol', None, 'Meyerowitz']
