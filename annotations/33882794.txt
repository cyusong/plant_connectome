Pre-mRNA splicing is a vital step in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a multidalton RNA-protein complex, through two successive transesterifications to yield mature mRNAs. In Arabidopsis, more than 61% of all transcripts from intron-containing genes are alternatively spliced, thereby resulting in transcriptome and subsequent proteome diversities for cellular processes. Moreover, it is estimated that more alternative splicing (AS) events induced by adverse stimuli occur to confer stress tolerance. Recently, increasing AS variants encoding normal or novel proteins, or degraded by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and their corresponding splicing factors or regulators acting at the posttranscriptional level have been functionally characterized. This review comprehensively summarizes and highlights the advances in our understanding of the biological functions and underlying mechanisms of AS events and their regulators in Arabidopsis and provides prospects for further research on AS in crops.
