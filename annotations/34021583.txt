Estimation of cell-cycle parameters is crucial for understanding the developmental programs established during the formation of an organism. A number of complementary approaches have been developed and adapted to plants to assess the cell-cycle status in different proliferative tissues. The most classical methods relying on metabolic labeling are still very much employed and give valuable information on cell-cycle progression in fixed tissues. However, the growing knowledge of plant cell-cycle regulators with defined expression pattern together with the development of fluorescent proteins technology enabled the generation of fusion proteins that function individually or in conjunction as cell-cycle reporters. Together with the improvement of imaging techniques, in vivo live imaging to monitor plant cell-cycle progression in normal growth conditions or in response to different stimuli has been possible. Here, we review these tools and their specific outputs for plant cell-cycle analysis.
