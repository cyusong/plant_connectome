The Arabidopsis RING E3 ligase, XBAT32, was previously characterized as a regulator of lateral root initiation. However, how XBAT32 function to modulate lateral root initiation was unknown. In our recent paper, we demonstrated that XBAT32 is involved in ethylene biosynthesis and it is through this function that XBAT32 is able to regulate lateral root production. Here we discuss a few other findings, observed in the ethylene overproducing mutant, xbat32, that reflect the effect of elevated ethylene levels on plant growth and development. Ethylene signaling also regulates plant responses to adverse environmental conditions such as high salinity. Consistent with ethylene's role as a stress hormone, xbat32 exhibited increased sensitivity to salt stress during seed germination and postgerminative growth. Thus, XBAT32 may also play a role in ethylene mediated response to abiotic stresses.
