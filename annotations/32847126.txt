We characterized an Na<sup>+</sup> transporter SvHKT1;1 from a halophytic turf grass, <i>Sporobolus virginicus</i>. SvHKT1;1 mediated inward and outward Na<sup>+</sup> transport in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and did not complement K<sup>+</sup> transporter-defective mutant yeast. SvHKT1;1 did not complement <i>athkt1;1</i> mutant <i>Arabidopsis</i>, suggesting its distinguishable function from other typical HKT1 transporters. The transcript was abundant in the shoots compared with the roots in <i>S. virginicus</i> and was upregulated by severe salt stress (500 mM NaCl), but not by lower stress. <i>SvHKT1;1</i>-expressing <i>Arabidopsis</i> lines showed higher shoot Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations and lower salt tolerance than wild type (WT) plants under nonstress and salt stress conditions and showed higher Na<sup>+</sup> uptake rate in roots at the early stage of salt treatment. These results suggested that constitutive expression of <i>SvHKT1;1</i> enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> uptake in root epidermal cells, followed by increased Na<sup>+</sup> transport to shoots, which led to reduced salt tolerance. However, Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations in phloem sap of the SvHKT1;1 lines were higher than those in WT plants under salt stress. Based on this result, together with the induction of the <i>SvHKT1;1</i> transcription under high salinity stress, it was suggested that SvHKT1;1 plays a role in preventing excess shoot Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in <i>S. virginicus</i>.
