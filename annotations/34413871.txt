Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) levels in the soil often limit plant growth and development. As a result, crop production largely relies on the heavy use of chemical fertilizers, presenting a challenging problem in sustainable agriculture. To breed crops with higher K<sup>+</sup>-use efficiency (KUE), we must learn how K<sup>+</sup> is acquired from the soil by the root system and transported to the rest of the plant through K<sup>+</sup> transporters. In this study, we identified the function of the rice K<sup>+</sup> transporter <i>OsHAK8</i>, whose expression level is downregulated in response to low-K<sup>+</sup> stress. When <i>OsHAK8</i> was disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis, <i>Oshak8</i> mutant plants showed stunted growth, especially under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions. Ion content analyses indicated that K<sup>+</sup> uptake and root-to-shoot K<sup>+</sup> transport were significantly impaired in <i>Oshak8</i> mutants under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions. As the <i>OsHAK8</i> gene was broadly expressed in different cell types in the roots and its protein was targeted to the plasma membrane, we propose that OsHAK8 serves as a major transporter for both uptake and root-to-shoot translocation in rice plants.
