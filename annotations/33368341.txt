At leaf level, elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (eCO<sub>2</sub> ) results in stimulation of carbon net assimilation and reduction of stomatal conductance. However, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of eCO<sub>2</sub> at larger temporal (seasonal and annual) and spatial (from leaf to whole-tree) scales is still lacking. Here, we review overall trends, magnitude and drivers of dynamic tree responses to eCO<sub>2</sub> , including carbon and water relations at the leaf and the whole-tree level. Spring and early season leaf responses are most susceptible to eCO<sub>2</sub> and are followed by a down-regulation towards the onset of autumn. At the whole-tree level, CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization causes consistent biomass increments in young seedlings only, whereas mature trees show a variable response. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> -induced reductions in leaf stomatal conductance do not systematically translate into limitation of whole-tree transpiration due to the unpredictable response of canopy area. Reduction in the end-of-season carbon sink demand and water-limiting strategies are considered the main drivers of seasonal tree responses to eCO<sub>2</sub> . These large temporal and spatial variabilities in tree responses to eCO<sub>2</sub> highlight the risk of predicting tree behavior to eCO<sub>2</sub> based on single leaf-level point measurements as they only reveal snapshots of the dynamic responses to eCO<sub>2</sub> .
