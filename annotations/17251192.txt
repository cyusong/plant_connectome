['17251192', 'GEK1, an Arabidopsis thaliana gene product, was recently identified through its  involvement in ethanol tolerance. Later, this protein was shown to display 26%  strict identity with archaeal d-Tyr-tRNA(Tyr) deacylases. To determine whether it  actually possessed deacylase activity, the product of the GEK1 open reading frame  was expressed in Escherichia coli from a multi-copy plasmid. Purified GEK1  protein contains two zinc ions and proves to be a broad-specific, markedly active  d-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase in vitro. Moreover, GEK1 expression is capable of  functionally compensating in E. coli for the absence of endogeneous d-Tyr-  tRNA(Tyr) deacylase. Possible connections between exposure of plants to  ethanol/acetaldehyde and misaminoacylation of tRNA by d-amino acids are  considered.', '2007', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkl1145', 'Plateau']
