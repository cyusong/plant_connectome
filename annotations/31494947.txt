Plant interactions with herbivores and pathogens are among the most widespread ecological relationships, and show many congruent properties. Despite these similarities, general models describing how plant defenses function in ecosystems, and the prioritization of responses to emerging challenges such as climate change, invasive species and habitat alteration, often differ markedly between entomologists and plant pathologists. We posit that some fundamental distinctions between how insects and pathogens interact with plants underlie these differences. We propose a conceptual framework to help incorporate these distinctions into robust models and research priorities. The most salient distinctions include features of host-searching behavior, evasion of plant defenses, plant tolerance to utilization, and sources of insect and microbial population regulation. Collectively, these features lead to relatively more diffuse and environmentally mediated plant-insect interactions, and more intimate and genetically driven plant-pathogen interactions. Specific features of insect vs pathogen life histories can also yield different patterns of spatiotemporal dynamics. These differences can become increasingly pronounced when scaling from controlled laboratory to open ecological systems. Integrating these differences alongside similarities can foster improved models and research approaches to plant defense, trophic interactions, coevolutionary dynamics, food security and resource management, and provide guidance as traditional departments increase collaborations, or merge into larger units.
