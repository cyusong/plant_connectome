Two parallel pathways compartmentalized in the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum contribute to thylakoid lipid synthesis in plants, but how these two pathways are coordinated during thylakoid biogenesis and remodeling remains unknown. We report here the molecular characterization of a homologous ADIPOSE TRIGLYCERIDE LIPASE-LIKE gene, previously referred to as ATGLL. The ATGLL gene is ubiquitously expressed throughout development and rapidly upregulated in response to a wide range of environmental cues. We show that ATGLL is a chloroplast non-regioselective lipase with a hydrolytic activity preferentially towards 16:0 of diacylglycerol (DAG). Comprehensive lipid profiling and radiotracer labeling studies revealed a negative correlation of ATGLL expression and the relative contribution of the chloroplast lipid pathway to thylakoid lipid biosynthesis. Additionally, we show that genetic manipulation of ATGLL expression resulted in changes in triacylglycerol levels in leaves. We propose that ATGLL, through affecting the level of prokaryotic DAG in the chloroplast, plays important roles in balancing the two glycerolipid pathways and in maintaining lipid homeostasis in plants.
