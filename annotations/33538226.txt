Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) is known to produce alterations in root-system architecture, notably, by inhibiting primary root elongation and stimulating lateral root branching. This stimulation is associated with higher auxin transport promoted by apoplast acidification. Recently, we showed that MYB28 and MYB29 transcription factors play a role in ammonium tolerance, since its double mutant (<i>myb28myb29</i>) is highly hypersensitive toward ammonium nutrition in relation to altered Fe homeostasis. In the present work, we observed that primary root elongation was lower in the mutant with respect to wild-type plants under ammonium nutrition. Moreover, ammonium-induced lateral root branching was impaired in <i>myb28myb29</i> in a Fe-supply dependent manner. Further research is required to decipher the link between MYB28 and MYB29 functions and the signaling pathway leading to root-system architecture modification by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> supply.
