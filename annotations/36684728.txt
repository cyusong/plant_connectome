Vernalization is a period of low non-freezing temperatures, which provides the competence to flower. This mechanism ensures that plants sown before winter develop reproductive organs in more favourable conditions during spring. Such an evolutionary mechanism has evolved in both monocot and eudicot plants. Studies in monocots, represented by temperate cereals like wheat and barley, have identified and proposed the <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>) gene as a key player in the vernalization response. <i>VRN1</i> belongs to MADS-box transcription factors and is expressed in the leaves and the apical meristem, where it subsequently promotes flowering. Despite substantial research advancement in the last two decades, there are still gaps in our understanding of the vernalization mechanism. Here we summarise the present knowledge of wheat vernalization. We discuss <i>VRN1</i> allelic variation, review vernalization models, talk <i>VRN1</i> copy number variation and devernalization phenomenon. Finally, we suggest possible future directions of the vernalization research in wheat.
