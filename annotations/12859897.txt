['12859897', 'During angiosperm reproduction, pollen grains form a tube that navigates through  female tissues to the micropyle, delivering sperm to the egg; the signals that  mediate this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe a role for  gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in pollen tube growth and guidance. In vitro,  GABA stimulates pollen tube growth, although vast excesses are inhibitory. The  Arabidopsis POP2 gene encodes a transaminase that degrades GABA and contributes  to the formation of a gradient leading up to the micropyle. pop2 flowers  accumulate GABA, and the growth of many pop2 pollen tubes is arrested, consistent  with their in vitro GABA hypersensitivity. Some pop2 tubes continue to grow  toward ovules, yet they are misguided, presumably because they target ectopic  GABA on the ovule surface. Interestingly, wild-type tubes exhibit normal growth  and guidance in pop2 pistils, perhaps by degrading excess GABA and sharpening the  gradient leading to the micropyle.', '2003 Jul 11', 'Cell', '10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00479-3', 'Preuss']
