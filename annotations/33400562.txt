The induction of plant nutrient secretion systems is critical for successful pathogen infection. Some bacterial pathogens (e.g., <i>Xanthomonas</i> spp.) use transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors to induce transcription of SWEET sucrose efflux transporters. <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> strain DC3000 lacks TAL effectors yet is able to induce multiple SWEETs in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> by unknown mechanisms. Because bacteria require other nutrients in addition to sugars for efficient reproduction, we hypothesized that <i>Pseudomonas</i> spp. may depend on host transcription factors involved in secretory programs to increase access to essential nutrients. Bioinformatic analyses identified the <i>Arabidopsis</i> basic-leucine zipper transcription factor bZIP11 as a potential regulator of nutrient transporters, including SWEETs and UmamiT amino acid transporters. Inducible downregulation of <i>bZIP11</i> expression in <i>Arabidopsis</i> resulted in reduced growth of <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> strain DC3000, whereas inducible overexpression of <i>bZIP11</i> resulted in increased bacterial growth, supporting the hypothesis that bZIP11-regulated transcription programs are essential for maximal pathogen titer in leaves. Our data are consistent with a model in which a pathogen alters host transcription factor expression upstream of secretory transcription networks to promote nutrient efflux from host cells.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
