Rice (Oryza sativa) is sensitive to low temperatures, which affects the yield and quality of rice. Therefore, uncovering the molecular mechanisms behind chilling tolerance is a critical task for improving cold tolerance in rice cultivars. Here, we report that OsWRKY63, a WRKY transcription factor with an unknown function, negatively regulates chilling tolerance in rice. OsWRKY63-overexpressing rice lines are more sensitive to cold stress. Conversely, OsWRKY63-knockout mutants generated using a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach exhibited increased chilling tolerance. OsWRKY63 was expressed in all rice tissues, and OsWRKY63 expression was induced under cold stress, dehydration stress, high salinity stress, and ABA treatment. OsWRKY63 localized in the nucleus plays a role as a transcription repressor and downregulates many cold stress-related genes and reactive oxygen species scavenging-related genes. Molecular, biochemical, and genetic assays showed that OsWRKY76 is a direct target gene of OsWRKY63 and that its expression is suppressed by OsWRKY63. OsWRKY76-knockout lines had dramatically decreased cold tolerance, and the cold-induced expression of five OsDREB1 genes was repressed. OsWRKY76 interacted with OsbHLH148, transactivating the expression of OsDREB1B to enhance chilling tolerance in rice. Thus, our study suggests that OsWRKY63 negatively regulates chilling tolerance through the OsWRKY63-OsWRKY76-OsDREB1B transcriptional regulatory cascade in rice.
