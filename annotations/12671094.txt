['12671094', 'SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-box genes (SBP-box genes) encode plant-specific  proteins that share a highly conserved DNA binding domain, the SBP domain.  Although likely to represent transcription factors, little is known about their  role in development. In Arabidopsis, SBP-box genes constitute a structurally  heterogeneous family of 16 members known as SPL genes. For one of these genes,  SPL8, we isolated three independent transposon-tagged mutants, all of which  exhibited a strong reduction in fertility. Microscopic analysis revealed that  this reduced fertility is attributable primarily to abnormally developed  microsporangia, which exhibit premeiotic abortion of the sporocytes. In addition  to its role in microsporogenesis, the SPL8 knockout also seems to affect  megasporogenesis, trichome formation on sepals, and stamen filament elongation.  The SPL8 mutants described help to uncover the roles of SBP-box genes in plant  development.', '2003 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010678', 'Huijser']
