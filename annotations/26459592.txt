['26459592', 'The Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase regulates essential processes in plant  growth and development by modulation of metabolism and translation in response to  environmental signals. In this study, we show that abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism  is also regulated by the TOR kinase. Indeed ABA hormone level strongly decreases  in Lst8-1 and Raptor3g mutant lines as well as in wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis  plants treated with AZD-8055, a TOR inhibitor. However the growth and germination  of these lines are more sensitive to exogenous ABA. The diminished ABA hormone  accumulation is correlated with lower transcript levels of ZEP, NCED3 and AAO3  biosynthetic enzymes, and higher transcript amount of the CYP707A2 gene encoding  a key-enzyme in abscisic acid catabolism. These results suggest that the TOR  signaling pathway is implicated in the regulation of ABA accumulation in  Arabidopsis.', '2015 Nov 27', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.10.028', 'Leprince']
