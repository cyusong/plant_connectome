['8979397', 'In order to detect gene products involved in Arabidopsis drought adaptive  strategy, 2D-PAGE protein patterns of two auxin-insensitive mutants, axr1, axr2,  differentially affected in specific drought responses, were compared to the  wild-type Columbia ecotype, in well-watered and drought-stressed conditions.  Coupled to computer analysis of polypeptide amounts, 2D-electrophoresis revealed  subtle changes in protein expression induced by progressive drought stress and/or  mutations affecting the auxin response pathway. The differential protein patterns  of axr1 and axr2 were consistent with their contrasting drought responses. The  specific leaf and root protein patterns of axr1 showed that this mutation  disrupts drought responses related to auxin regulation. In particular, the near  absence of drought rhizogenesis in axr1 was associated with a root protein  pattern closer to the well-watered than to the water-stressed axr2 and Columbia  wild-type root protein patterns. Also, the largely different effects of axr1 and  axr2 mutations suggest that they affect different pathways in auxin response.  Several sets of polypeptides, whose regulation was affected by drought and/or  mutation, were thus detected. These polypeptides could play a role both in the  auxin and the drought response pathways. Their identification, through  microsequencing, should be most informative.', '1996 Oct', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029046', 'Vartanian']
