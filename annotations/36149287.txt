Salt stress simultaneously causes ionic toxicity, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress, which directly impact plant growth and development. Plants have developed numerous strategies to adapt to saline environments. Whereas some of these strategies have been investigated and exploited for crop improvement, much remains to be understood, including how salt stress is perceived by plants and how plants coordinate effective responses to the stress. It is, however, clear that the plant cell wall is the first contact point between external salt and the plant. In this context, significant advances in our understanding of halotropism, cell wall synthesis, and integrity surveillance, as well as salt-related cytoskeletal rearrangements, have been achieved. Indeed, molecular mechanisms underpinning some of these processes have recently been elucidated. In this review, we aim to provide insights into how plants respond and adapt to salt stress, with a special focus on primary cell wall biology in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
