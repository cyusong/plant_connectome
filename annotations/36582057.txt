['36582057', 'The lepidopteran crop pest Plutella xylostella causes severe constraints on  Brassica cultivation. Here, we report a novel role for RPX1 (resistance to P.  xylostella) in resistance to this pest in Arabidopsis thaliana. The rpx1-1 mutant  repels P. xylostella larvae, and feeding on the rpx1-1 mutant severely damages  the peritrophic matrix structure in the midgut of the larvae, thereby negatively  affecting larval growth and pupation. This resistance results from the  accumulation of defence compounds, including the homoterpene  (3E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), due to the upregulation of PENTACYCLIC  TRITERPENE SYNTHASE 1 (PEN1), which encodes a key DMNT biosynthetic enzyme. P.  xylostella infestation and wounding induce RPX1 protein degradation, which may  confer a rapid response to insect infestation. RPX1 inactivation and PEN1  overexpression are not associated with negative trade-offs for plant growth but  have much higher seed production than the wild-type in the presence of P.  xylostella infestation. This study offers a new strategy for plant molecular  breeding against P. xylostella.', '2023 Mar', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.14528', 'ORCID:']
