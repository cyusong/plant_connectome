We have previously demonstrated that introgression of PcINO1 gene from Porteresia coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka, coding for a novel salt-tolerant L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase (MIPS) protein, confers salt tolerance to transgenic tobacco plants (Majee, M., Maitra, S., Dastidar, K.G., Pattnaik, S., Chatterjee, A., Hait, N.C., Das, K.P. and Majumder, A.L. (2004) A novel salt-tolerant L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase from Porteresia coarctata (Roxb.) Tateoka, a halophytic wild rice: molecular cloning, bacterial overexpression, characterization, and functional introgression into tobacco-conferring salt-tolerance phenotype. J. Biol. Chem. 279, 28539-28552). In this communication we have shown that functional introgression of the PcINO1 gene confers salt-tolerance to evolutionary diverse organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes including crop plants albeit to a variable extent. A direct correlation between unabated increased synthesis of inositol under salinity stress by the PcINO1 gene product and salt tolerance has been demonstrated for all the systems pointing towards the universality of the application across evolutionary divergent taxa.
