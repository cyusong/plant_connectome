<i>Salix floderusii</i> is a rare alpine tree species in the <i>Salix</i> genus. Unfortunately, no extensive germplasm identification, molecular phylogeny, and chloroplast genomics of this plant have been conducted. We sequenced the chloroplast (cp) genome of <i>S. floderusii</i> for the first time using second-generation sequencing technology. The cp genome was 155,540 bp long, including a large single-copy region (LSC, 84,401 bp), a small single-copy region (SSC, 16,221 bp), and inverted repeat regions (IR, 54,918 bp). A total of 131 genes were identified, including 86 protein genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. The <i>S. floderusii</i> cp genome contains 1 complement repeat, 24 forward repeats, 17 palindromic repeats, and 7 reverse repeats. Analysis of the IR borders showed that the IRa and IRb regions of <i>S. floderusii</i> and <i>Salix caprea</i> were shorter than those of <i>Salix cinerea</i>, which may affect plastome evolution. Furthermore, four highly variable regions were found, including the <i>rpl22</i> coding region, <i>psbM/trnD-GUC</i> non-coding region, <i>petA/psbJ</i> non-coding region, and <i>ycf1</i> coding region. These high variable regions can be used as candidate molecular markers and as a reference for identifying future <i>Salix</i> species. In addition, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the cp genome of <i>S. floderusii</i> is sister to <i>Salix cupularis</i> and belongs to the Subgenus <i>Vetrix</i>. Genes (Sf-<i>trnI</i>, Sf-<i>PpsbA</i>, <i>aadA</i>, Sf-<i>TpsbA</i>, Sf-<i>trnA</i>) obtained via cloning were inserted into the pBluescript II SK (+) to yield the cp expression vectors, which harbored the selectable marker gene <i>aadA</i>. The results of a spectinomycin resistance test indicated that the cp expression vector had been successfully constructed. Moreover, the <i>aadA</i> gene was efficiently expressed under the regulation of predicted regulatory elements. The present study provides a solid foundation for establishing subsequent <i>S. floderusii</i> cp transformation systems and developing strategies for the genetic improvement of <i>S. floderusii.</i>
