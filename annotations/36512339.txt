Plant volatile organic compounds are the most abundant and structurally diverse plant secondary metabolites. They play a key role in plant lifespan via direct and indirect plant defenses, attracting pollinators, and mediating various interactions between plants and their environment. The ecological diversity and context-dependence of plant-plant communication driven by volatiles are crucial elements that influence plant performance in different habitats. Plant volatiles are also valued for their multiple applications in food, flavor, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries. In the current review, we summarize recent advances that have elucidated the functions of plant volatile organic compounds as mediators of plant interaction at community and individual levels, highlighting the complexities of plant receiver feedback to various signals and cues. This review emphasizes volatile terpenoids, the most abundant class of plant volatile organic compounds, highlighting their role in plant adaptability to global climate change and stress-response pathways that are integral to plant growth and survival. Finally, we identify research gaps and suggest future research directions.
