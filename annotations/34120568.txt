Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) as a key enzyme play crucial roles in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and Calvin cycle processes in plants. However, limited information is known regarding <i>FBA</i> genes in <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>. In this study, 16 <i>FBAs</i> were identified and characterized in <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes can be categorized as type I (<i>NtFBA1-10</i> located in chloroplast) and type II (<i>NtFBA11-16</i> located in cytoplasm) subfamilies. According to the conserved motifs and gene structure analysis, NtFBA protein sequences had the highly homologous to FBAs in other species. Most members of the <i>NtFBA</i> gene family responded positively to NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress, especially the expression of <i>NtFBA13/14</i> increased by 642%. In addition, the expression results of <i>NtFBAs</i> under five abiotic stress (light, NaCl, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, drought, and cold) conditions were showed that <i>NtFBA13/14</i> were highly up-regulated. qRT-PCR results showed that most of the <i>NtFBAs</i> expressed higher in leaves. <i>NtFBA7/8</i> and <i>NtFBA13/14</i> have important significance in photosynthesis and abiotic stress, respectively. This study provides a basis foundation for further elucidating the function of <i>NtFBAs</i> and the <i>N. tabacum</i> mechanism of resistance under abiotic stress.
