Changes in the aperture of this pore regulate plant water-use efficiency, defined as gain of C by photosynthesis per leaf water transpired. Stomatal aperture is actively regulated by reversible changes in guard cell osmolyte content. Despite the fact that guard cells can photosynthesize on their own, the accumulation of mesophyll-derived metabolites can seemingly act as signals which contribute to the regulation of stomatal movement. It has been shown that malate can act as a signalling molecule and a counter-ion of potassium, a well-established osmolyte that accumulates in the vacuole of guard cells during stomatal opening. By contrast, their efflux from guard cells is an important mechanism during stomatal closure. It has been hypothesized that the breakdown of starch, sucrose and lipids is an important mechanism during stomatal opening, which may be related to ATP production through glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism, and/or accumulation of osmolytes such as sugars and malate. However, experimental evidence supporting this theory is lacking. Here we highlight the particularities of guard cell metabolism and discuss this in the context of the guard cells themselves and their interaction with the mesophyll cells.
