Lateral branches such as shoot and panicle are determining factors and target traits for rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield improvement. Cytokinin promotes rice lateral branching; however, the mechanism underlying the fine-tuning of cytokinin homeostasis in rice branching remains largely unknown. Here, we report the map-based cloning of RICE LATERAL BRANCH (RLB) encoding a nuclear-localized, KNOX-type homeobox protein from a rice cytokinin-deficient mutant showing more tillers, sparser panicles, defected floret morphology as well as attenuated shoot regeneration from callus. RLB directly binds to the promoter and represses the transcription of OsCKX4, a cytokinin oxidase gene with high abundance in panicle branch meristem. OsCKX4 over-expression lines phenocopied rlb, which showed upregulated OsCKX4 levels. Meanwhile, RLB physically binds to Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components OsEMF2b and co-localized with H3K27me3, a suppressing histone modification mediated by PRC2, in the OsCKX4 promoter. We proposed that RLB recruits PRC2 to the OsCKX4 promoter to epigenetically repress its transcription, which suppresses the catabolism of cytokinin, thereby promoting rice lateral branching. Moreover, antisense inhibition of OsCKX4 under the LOG promoter successfully increased panicle size and spikelet number per plant without affecting other major agronomic traits. This study provides insight into cytokinin homeostasis, lateral branching in plants, and also promising target genes for rice genetic improvement.
