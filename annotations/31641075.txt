['31641075', 'Chromatin modification has gained increased attention for its role in the  regulation of plant responses to environmental changes, but the specific  mechanisms and molecular players remain elusive. Here, we show that the  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) histone methyltransferase SET DOMAIN GROUP8  (SDG8) mediates genome-wide changes in H3K36 methylation at specific genomic loci  functionally relevant to nitrate treatments. Moreover, we show that the specific  H3K36 methyltransferase encoded by SDG8 is required for canonical RNA processing,  and that RNA isoform switching is more prominent in the sdg8-5 deletion mutant  than in the wild type. To demonstrate that SDG8-mediated regulation of RNA  isoform expression is functionally relevant, we examined a putative regulatory  gene, CONSTANS, CO-like, and TOC1 101 (CCT101), whose nitrogen-responsive  isoform-specific RNA expression is mediated by SDG8. We show by functional  expression in shoot cells that the different RNA isoforms of CCT101 encode  distinct regulatory proteins with different effects on genome-wide transcription.  We conclude that SDG8 is involved in plant responses to environmental nitrogen  supply, affecting multiple gene regulatory processes including genome-wide  histone modification, transcriptional regulation, and RNA processing, and thereby  mediating developmental and metabolic processes related to nitrogen use.', '2020 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00682', 'ORCID:']
