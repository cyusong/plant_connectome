Esca disease is one of the major grapevine trunk diseases in Europe and the etiology is complex, since several inhabiting fungi are identified to be associated with this disease. Among the foliar symptom expressions, the apoplectic form may be distinguished and characterized by sudden dieback of shoots, leaf drop, and shriveling of grape clusters in a few days that can ultimately induce the plant death. To further understand this drastic event, we conducted transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to characterize responses of leaves during the period preceding symptom appearance (20 and 7 days before foliar symptom expression) and at the day of apoplexy expression. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses provide signatures for the apoplectic leaves and most changes concerning the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and phenylpropanoids. In deciphering glutathione-S-transferase (GST), its preferential location in phloem, correlated with the upregulation of GST genes and a decrease of the glutathione level, offers further support to the putative role of glutathione during apoplexy expression.
