['16507080', 'Programmed cell death (PCD) is a common process in eukaryotes during development  and in response to pathogens and stress signals. Bax inihibitor-1 (BI-1) is  proposed to be a cell death suppressor that is conserved in both animals and  plants, but the physiological importance of BI-1 and the impact of its loss of  function in plants are still unclear. In this study, we identified and  characterized two independent Arabidopsis mutants with a T-DNA insertion in the  AtBI1 gene. The phenotype of atbi1-1 and atbi1-2, with a C-terminal missense  mutation and a gene knockout, respectively, was indistinguishable from wild-type  plants under normal growth conditions. However, these two mutants exhibit  accelerated progression of cell death upon infiltration of leaf tissues with a  PCD-inducing fungal toxin fumonisin B1 (FB1) and increased sensitivity to heat  shock-induced cell death. Under these conditions, expression of AtBI1 mRNA was  up-regulated in wild-type leaves prior to the activation of cell death,  suggesting that increase of AtBI1 expression is important for basal suppression  of cell death progression. Over-expression of AtBI1 transgene in the two  homozygous mutant backgrounds rescued the accelerated cell death phenotypes.  Together, our results provide direct genetic evidence for a role of BI-1 as an  attenuator for cell death progression triggered by both biotic and abiotic types  of cell death signals in Arabidopsis.', '2006 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02654.x', 'Lam']
