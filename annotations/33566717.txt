This study assessed the responses of wild-type (WT) and transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> expressing seven combinations of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (<i>pepc</i>), pyruvate phosphate dikinase (<i>ppdk</i>), and NADP-malic enzyme (<i>nadp-me</i>) to high light. Our results showed that the net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate (<i>P</i><sub>n</sub>) and shoot dry weight of four of the transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> genotypes were significantly different from those of WT under high-light treatment, being in the order of <i>Zmpepc+Zmppdk+Zmnadp-me</i> (PC-K-M) > <i>Zmpepc+Zmppdk</i> (PC-K) > <i>Zmpepc</i> (PC), <i>Zmpepc+Zmnadp-me</i> (PC-M) > WT. The other genotypes did not differ from WT. This indicated that <i>Zmpepc</i> was essential for maintaining high photosynthetic performance under high light, <i>Zmppdk</i> had a positive synergistic effect on <i>Zmpepc</i>, and the combination of all three genes had the greatest synergistic effect. These four genotypes also maintained higher photosystem II (PSII) activity (K-phase, J-phase, RC/CSm), electron transfer capacity (J-phase), and photochemical efficiency (TRo/ABS), and accumulated less reactive oxygen species (O<sub>2</sub>·<sup>-</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and suffered less damage to the membrane system (MDA) than WT under high light. Collectively, PC, PC-K, PC-M, and PC-K-M used most of the absorbed energy for CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation through a significantly higher <i>P</i><sub>n</sub>, which reduced the generation of excess electrons in the photosynthetic apparatus, thereby reducing damage to the membrane system and PSII. This ultimately resulted in improved high-light tolerance. <i>P</i><sub>n</sub> was the main reason for the significant difference in the high-light tolerance of the four genotypes. Joint expression of the three maize genes may be of great value in the genetic improvement of high-light tolerance in C<sub>3</sub> crops.
