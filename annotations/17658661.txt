A cDNA-encoding a peroxidase (Helianthus annuus POX (HaPOX)1) was isolated and characterized from the roots of sunflower seedlings. This gene exhibited homology with other peroxidases from several higher-plant species, and its expression in the root growth was particularly abundant during cell expansion. To elucidate the precise functions of HaPOX1 in sunflower root, we examined its expression pattern in response to several plant growth regulators. Expression of HaPOX1 is down-regulated by abscisic acid (ABA), whereas indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) induced its expression. These results suggest that HaPOX1 expression is differentially regulated by phytohormonal components of signaling cascades. Since IAA appears to participate in the regulation of HaPOX1 expression, we postulate that the peroxidase encoded by HaPOX1 may be involved in the reactions that promote cell elongation during the early stage of root growth.
