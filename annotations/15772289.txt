['15772289', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) is important in seed maturation, seed dormancy, stomatal  closure, and stress response. Many genes that function in ABA signal transduction  pathways have been identified. However, most important signaling molecules  involved in the perception of the ABA signal or with ABA receptors have not been  identified yet. Receptor-like kinase1 (RPK1), a Leu-rich repeat (LRR) receptor  kinase in the plasma membrane, is upregulated by ABA in Arabidopsis thaliana.  Here, we show the phenotypes of T-DNA insertion mutants and RPK1-antisense  plants. Repression of RPK1 expression in Arabidopsis decreased sensitivity to ABA  during germination, growth, and stomatal closure; microarray and RNA gel analysis  showed that many ABA-inducible genes are downregulated in these plants.  Furthermore, overexpression of the RPK1 LRR domain alone or fused with the  Brassinosteroid-insensitive1 kinase domain in plants resulted in phenotypes  indicating ABA sensitivity. RPK1 is involved in the main ABA signaling pathway  and in early ABA perception in Arabidopsis.', '2005 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.027474', 'Yamaguchi-Shinozaki']
