In rice (Oryza sativa) and other plants, plant architecture and seed size are closely related to yield. Brassinosteroid (BR) signaling and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (MAPK kinase kinase 10 [MAPKKK10]-MAPK kinase 4 [MAPKK4]-MAPK6) are two major regulatory pathways that control rice architecture and seed size. However, their possible relationship and crosstalk remain elusive. Here, we show that WRKY53 mediated the crosstalk between BR signaling and the MAPK pathway. Biochemical and genetic assays demonstrated that glycogen synthase kinase-2 (GSK2) phosphorylates WRKY53 and lowers its stability, indicating that WRKY53 is a substrate of GSK2 in BR signaling. WRKY53 interacted with BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1(BZR1); they function synergistically to regulate BR-related developmental processes. We also provide genetic evidence showing that WRKY53 functions in a common pathway with the MAPKKK10-MAPKK4-MAPK6 cascade in leaf angle and seed size control, suggesting that WRKY53 is a direct substrate of this pathway. Moreover, GSK2 phosphorylated MAPKK4 to suppress MAPK6 activity, suggesting that GSK2-mediated BR signaling might also regulated MAPK pathway. Together, our results revealed a critical role for WRKY53 and uncovered sophisticated levels of interplay between BR signaling and the MAPK pathway in regulating rice architecture and seed size.
