Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi interact with the roots of most land plants and help them to acquire various mineral resources from the soil, including potassium (K<sup>+</sup>). However, tracking K<sup>+</sup> movement in AM symbiosis remains challenging. Recently, we reported that rubidium can be used as a proxy for K<sup>+</sup> in mycorrhizal <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. In the present work, we investigated the possibility of using cesium (Cs<sup>+</sup>) as another proxy for K<sup>+</sup> in AM symbiosis. Plants were placed in growing systems that include a separate compartment only accessible to the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> isolate 09 and in which various amounts of cesium chloride (0 mM, 0.5 mM, 1.5 mM, or 3.75 mM) were supplied. Plants were watered with sufficient K<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>-free nutrient solutions, and shoot and root biomass, fungal colonization, and K<sup>+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup> concentrations were recorded seven weeks after inoculation. Our results indicate that Cs<sup>+</sup> accumulated in plant tissues only when K<sup>+</sup> was present in the nutrient solution and when the highest concentration of Cs<sup>+</sup> was used in the fungal compartment. Consequently, we conclude that Cs<sup>+</sup> could be used as a proxy for K<sup>+</sup> in AM symbiosis, but with serious limitations.
