The potential benefits of adding raw, non-food, lignocellulosic plant material as a carbon source for mixotrophic growth of microalgae have previously been demonstrated. This approach has advantages over using traditional carbon sources like glucose or acetate due to wide-spread plant biomass availability and substrate recalcitrance to bacterial contamination. Here, we report the overall growth characteristics and explore the metabolic patterns of <i>Scenedesmus obliquus</i> cultured in the presence raw plant substrate. An initial screen of plant substrate candidates showed an increase in specific growth rate and biomass accumulation when <i>S. obliquus</i> was cultured in the presence of switchgrass or yard waste compared to media alone. We observed a near doubling of microalgal dry weight when <i>S. obliquus</i> was grown with 0.2% (<i>w/v</i>) switchgrass under ambient CO<sub>2</sub>. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of corn stem after <i>S. obliquus</i> cultivation exhibited substantial phloem degradation. Transcriptomic analyses of <i>S. obliquus</i> during mid- and late-log phase growth revealed a dynamic metabolic landscape within many KEGG pathways. Notably, differential expression was observed for several potential glycosyl hydrolases. We also investigated the influence of switchgrass on the growth of <i>S. obliquus</i> at 50 L volume in mini raceway ponds to determine the scalability of this approach.
