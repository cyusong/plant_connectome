As plant scientists we are all too familiar with the generic commentary that is often associated with the development or use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in agricultural systems, but through fact-driven communication, constructive engagement can be achieved. The EU-funded 'AMIGA' project, one element of which involved assessing the impact of a GM potato (previously engineered for late blight resistance using cisgenics) with field trials in Ireland, provides a valuable case study in how this can come about. The experiences detailed highlight important lessons learnt relating to the presentation of scientific evidence in a non-scientific format and the necessity for greater integration of biological and social sciences to support the participation of biological researchers in public engagement exercises.
