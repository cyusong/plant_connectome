['25793367', "Transfer RNA (tRNA) precursors undergo endoribonucleolytic processing of their 5'  and 3' ends. 5' cleavage of the precursor transcript is performed by ribonuclease  P (RNase P). While in most organisms RNase P is a ribonucleoprotein that harbors  a catalytically active RNA component, human mitochondria and the chloroplasts  (plastids) and mitochondria of seed plants possess protein-only RNase P enzymes  (PRORPs). The plant organellar PRORP (PRORP1) has been characterized to some  extent in vitro and by transient gene silencing, but the molecular, phenotypic  and physiological consequences of its down-regulation in stable transgenic plants  have not been assessed. Here we have addressed the function of the dually  targeted organellar PRORP enzyme in vivo by generating stably transformed  Arabidopsis plants in which expression of the PRORP1 gene was suppressed by RNA  interference (RNAi). PRORP1 knock-down lines show defects in photosynthesis,  while mitochondrial respiration is not appreciably affected. In both plastids and  mitochondria, the effects of PRORP1 knock-down on the processing of individual  tRNA species are highly variable. The drastic reduction in the levels of mature  plastid tRNA-Phe(GAA) and tRNA-Arg(ACG) suggests that these two tRNA species  limit plastid gene expression in the PRORP1 mutants and, hence, are causally  responsible for the mutant phenotype.", '2015', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0120533', 'Bock']
