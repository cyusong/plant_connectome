Brassinosteroid (BR) signalling is known to be coordinated with light signalling in above ground tissue. Many studies focusing on the shade avoidance response in above ground tissue or hypocotyl elongation in darkness have revealed the contribution of the BR signalling pathway to these processes. We previously analysed the expression of DWARF 4 (DWF4), a key BR biosynthesis enzyme, and revealed that light perception in above ground tissues triggered DWF4 accumulation in root tips. To determine the required wavelength of light and photoreceptors responsible for this regulation, we studied DWF4-GUS marker plants grown in several monochromatic light conditions. We revealed that monochromatic blue LED light could induce DWF4 accumulation in primary root tips and root growth as much as white light, whereas monochromatic red LED could not. Consistent with this, a cryptochrome1/2 double mutant showed retarded root growth under white light whereas a phytochromeA/B double mutant did not. Taken together, our data strongly indicated that blue light signalling was important for DWF4 accumulation in root tips and root growth. Furthermore, DWF4 accumulation patterns in primary root tips were not altered by auxin or sugar treatment. Therefore, we hypothesize that blue light signalling from the shoot tissue is different from auxin and sugar signalling.

Light: !induces! DWF4 accumulation
Blue LED light: !induces! DWF4 accumulation
Cryptochrome1/2: !retards! root growth
PhytochromeA/B: !does not affect! root growth
Auxin: !does not affect! DWF4 accumulation
Sugar: !does not affect! DWF4 accumulation
