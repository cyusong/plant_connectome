Anthocyanidins are important pigments that cause plant tissues to develop colors. They have attracted much attention due to their crucial regulatory roles in plant growth as well as their health benefits. In order to reveal the molecular mechanism of anthocyanidin synthesis and regulation in purple corn (Zea mays L.) in this study, purple corn 963 was used to compare differences in gene expression during three stages of grain development by transcriptome analysis. A total of 17,168 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (7564 up-regulated and 9604 down-regulated DGEs) were identified. The DEGs were significantly enriched in "Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis", "Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites", and "Plant hormone signal transduction". In addition, 72 % of the structural genes that regulate anthocyanidin synthesis were up-regulated, and the transcription factors related to the accumulation of anthocyanidins were enriched during grain development. Moreover, the differential expression of phytohormone genes might also be an important factor in anthocyanidin accumulation. Transcriptomic analysis presents a molecular basis for the study of grain color changes in the three stages of grain development, and provides information for further research on the mechanism of anthocyanidin synthesis.
