['9238008', 'The endogenous clock that drives circadian rhythms is thought to communicate  temporal information within the cell via cycling downstream transcripts. A  transcript encoding a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein, Atgrp7, in Arabidopsis  thaliana undergoes circadian oscillations with peak levels in the evening. The  AtGRP7 protein also cycles with a time delay so that Atgrp7 transcript levels  decline when the AtGRP7 protein accumulates to high levels. After AtGRP7 protein  concentration has fallen to trough levels, Atgrp7 transcript starts to  reaccumulate. Overexpression of AtGRP7 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants severely  depresses cycling of the endogenous Atgrp7 transcript. These data establish both  transcript and protein as components of a negative feedback circuit capable of  generating a stable oscillation. AtGRP7 overexpression also depresses the  oscillation of the circadian-regulated transcript encoding the related  RNA-binding protein AtGRP8 but does not affect the oscillation of transcripts  such as cab or catalase mRNAs. We propose that the AtGRP7 autoregulatory loop  represents a "slave" oscillator in Arabidopsis that receives temporal information  from a central "master" oscillator, conserves the rhythmicity by negative  feedback, and transduces it to the output pathway by regulating a subset of  clock-controlled transcripts.', '1997 Aug 5', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.94.16.8515', 'Staiger']
