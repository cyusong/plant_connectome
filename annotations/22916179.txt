['22916179', 'Cell adhesion in plants is mediated predominantly by pectins, a group of complex  cell wall associated polysaccharides. An Arabidopsis mutant, friable1 (frb1), was  identified through a screen of T-DNA insertion lines that exhibited defective  cell adhesion. Interestingly, the frb1 plants displayed both cell and organ  dissociations and also ectopic defects in organ separation. The FRB1 gene encodes  a Golgi-localized, plant specific protein with only weak sequence similarities to  known proteins (DUF246). Unlike other cell adhesion deficient mutants, frb1  mutants do not have reduced levels of adhesion related cell wall polymers, such  as pectins. Instead, FRB1 affects the abundance of galactose- and  arabinose-containing oligosaccharides in the Golgi. Furthermore, frb1 mutants  displayed alteration in pectin methylesterification, cell wall associated  extensins and xyloglucan microstructure. We propose that abnormal FRB1 action has  pleiotropic consequences on wall architecture, affecting both the extensin and  pectin matrices, with consequent changes to the biomechanical properties of the  wall and middle lamella, thereby influencing cell-cell adhesion.', '2012', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0042914', 'Bonetta']
