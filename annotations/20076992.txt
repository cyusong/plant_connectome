Here we report the production of marker-free transgenic plants expressing phenolic compounds with high pharmacological value. Our strategy consisted in simultaneous delivery of lox-target and cre-containing constructs into the plant genome by cotransformation. In the Cre-vector, the cre recombinase gene was controlled by a seed-specific napin promoter. In the lox-target construct the selectable bar gene was placed between two lox sites in direct orientation, while a napin promoter driven vstI gene was inserted outside of the lox sites. Upon seed-specific cre induction the bar expression cassette was excised from the tobacco genome. Genetic and molecular analysis of T1 progeny plants indicated DNA excision in all 10 transgenic lines tested. RP-HPLC analysis demonstrated that the expression of the vstI gene resulted in accumulation of trans-resveratrol and its glycosylated derivative piceid in seeds of all marker free lines. These findings indicate that the seed-specific marker gene excision did not interfere with the expression of the gene of interest. Our data demonstrated the feasi of a developmentally controlled cre gene to mediate site-specific excision in tobacco very efficiently.
