A small gene family of phosphatidyl ethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBP) has been shown to function as key regulators in flowering; in Arabidopsis thaliana the FT protein promotes flowering whilst the closely related TFL1 protein represses flowering. Control of flowering time in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] is important for geographic adaptation and maximizing yield. Soybean breeders have identified a series of loci, the E-genes, that control photoperiod-mediated flowering time, yet how these loci control flowering is poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the expression of GmFT-like genes in the E1 near-isogenic line (NIL) background. Of the 20 closely related PEBP proteins in the soybean genome, ten are similar to the Arabidopsis FT protein. Expression analysis of these ten GmFT-like genes confirmed that only two are detectable in the conditions tested. Further analysis of these two genes in the E1 NILs grown under short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions showed a diurnal expression and tissue specificity expression commensurate with soybean flowering time under SD and LD conditions, suggesting that these were good candidates for flowering induction in soybean. Arabidopsis ft mutant lines flowered early when transformed with the two soybean genes, suggesting that the soybean genes can complement the Arabidopsis FT function. Flowering time in E1 NILs is consistent with the differential expression of the two GmFT-like genes under SD and LD conditions, suggesting that the E1 locus, at least in part, impacts time to flowering through the regulation of soybean FT expression.
