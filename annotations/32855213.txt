Blue light regulates multiple processes that optimize light capture and gas exchange in plants, including chloroplast movement, changes in stomatal conductance, and altered organ positioning. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), these processes are primarily modulated by the blue light phototropin photoreceptors phot1 and phot2. Changes in leaf positioning and shape involve several signaling components that include NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL3, PHYTOCHROME KINASE SUBSTRATE, ROOT PHOTOTROPISM2, and alterations in localized auxin streams. Direct phosphorylation of the auxin transporter ATP-BINDING CASSETTE subfamily B19 (ABCB19) by phot1 in phototropic seedlings suggests that phot1 may directly regulate ABCB19 to adjust auxin-dependent leaf responses. Here, <i>abcb19</i> mutants were analyzed for fluence and blue light-dependent changes in leaf positioning and morphology. <i>abcb19</i> displays upright petiole angles that remain unchanged in response to red and blue light. Similarly, <i>abcb19</i> mutants develop irregularly wavy rosette leaves that are less sensitive to blue light-mediated leaf flattening. Visualization of auxin distribution, measurement of auxin transport in protoplasts, and direct quantification of free auxin levels suggest these irregularities are caused by misregulation of ABCB19-mediated auxin distribution in addition to light-dependent auxin biosynthesis.
