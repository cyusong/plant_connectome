['22291198', "Amino acids serve as transport forms for organic nitrogen in the plant, and  multiple transport steps are involved in cellular import and export. While the  nature of the export mechanism is unknown, overexpression of GLUTAMINE DUMPER1  (GDU1) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) led to increased amino acid export.  To gain insight into GDU1's role, we searched for ethyl-methanesulfonate  suppressor mutants and performed yeast-two-hybrid screens. Both methods uncovered  the same gene, LOSS OF GDU2 (LOG2), which encodes a RING-type E3 ubiquitin  ligase. The interaction between LOG2 and GDU1 was confirmed by glutathione  S-transferase pull-down, in vitro ubiquitination, and in planta  coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Confocal microscopy and subcellular  fractionation indicated that LOG2 and GDU1 both localized to membranes and were  enriched at the plasma membrane. LOG2 expression overlapped with GDU1 in the  xylem and phloem tissues of Arabidopsis. The GDU1 protein encoded by the  previously characterized intragenic suppressor mutant log1-1, with an arginine in  place of a conserved glycine, failed to interact in the multiple assays,  suggesting that the Gdu1D phenotype requires the interaction of GDU1 with LOG2.  This hypothesis was supported by suppression of the Gdu1D phenotype after  reduction of LOG2 expression using either artificial microRNAs or a LOG2 T-DNA  insertion. Altogether, in accordance with the emerging bulk of data showing  membrane protein regulation via ubiquitination, these data suggest that the  interaction of GDU1 and the ubiquitin ligase LOG2 plays a significant role in the  regulation of amino acid export from plant cells.", '2012 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.191965', 'Pilot']
