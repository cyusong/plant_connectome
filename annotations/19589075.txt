Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) induces the most important disease threatening sugar beet. The growth of partially resistant hybrids carrying monogenic dominant resistance genes stabilize yield but are unable to entirely prevent virus infection and replication. P25 is responsible for symptom development and previous studies have shown that recently occurring resistance-breaking isolates possess increased P25 variability. To better understand the viral pathogenicity factor's interplay with plant proteins and to possibly unravel the molecular basis of sugar beet antivirus resistance, P25 was applied in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a resistant sugar beet cDNA library. This screen identified candidate proteins recognized as orthologues from other plant species which are known to be expressed following pathogen infection and involved in plant defense response. Most of the candidates potentially related to host-pathogen interactions were involved in the ubiquitylation process and plants response to stress, and were part of cell and metabolism components. The interaction of several candidate genes with P25 was confirmed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells by transient agrobacterium-mediated expression applying bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. The putative functions of several of the candidates identified support previous findings and present first targets for understanding the BNYVV pathogenicity and antivirus resistance mechanism.
