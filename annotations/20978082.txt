['20978082', 'The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is the fundamental structure that is located at  the growing tip and gives rise to all aerial parts of plant tissues and organs,  such as leaves, stems and flowers. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the CLAVATA3 (CLV3)  pathway regulates the stem cell pool in the SAM, in which a small peptide ligand  derived from CLV3 is perceived by two major receptor complexes, CLV1 and  CLV2-CORYNE (CRN)/SUPPRESSOR OF LLP1 2 (SOL2), to restrict WUSCHEL (WUS)  expression. In this study, we used the functional, synthetic CLV3 peptide (MCLV3)  to isolate CLV3-insensitive mutants and revealed that a receptor-like kinase,  RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 2 (RPK2), also known as TOADSTOOL 2 (TOAD2), is  another key regulator of meristem maintenance. Mutations in the RPK2 gene result  in stem cell expansion and increased number of floral organs, as seen in the  other clv mutants. These phenotypes are additive with both clv1 and clv2  mutations. Moreover, our biochemical analyses using Nicotiana benthamiana  revealed that RPK2 forms homo-oligomers but does not associate with CLV1 or CLV2.  These genetic and biochemical findings suggest that three major receptor  complexes, RPK2 homomers, CLV1 homomers and CLV2-CRN/SOL2 heteromers, are likely  to mediate three signalling pathways, mainly in parallel but with potential  crosstalk, to regulate the SAM homeostasis.', '2010 Nov', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.048199', 'Sawa']
