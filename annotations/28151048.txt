Magnaporthe oryzae (rice blast) and the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola are causing two of the most important pathogenic diseases jeopardizing rice production. Here, we show that root-knot nematode infestation on rice roots leads to important above-ground changes in plant immunity gene expression, which is correlated with significantly enhanced susceptibility to blast disease. A detailed metabolic analysis of oxidative stress responses and hormonal balances demonstrates that the above-ground tissues have a disturbed oxidative stress level, with accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as well as hormonal disturbances. Moreover, double infection experiments on an oxidative stress mutant and an auxin-deficient rice line indicate that the accumulation of auxin in the above-ground tissue is at least partly responsible for the blast-promoting effect of root-knot nematode infection.
