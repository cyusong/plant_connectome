Finding a suitable oviposition site is a challenging task for a gravid female moth. At the same time, it is of paramount importance considering the limited capability of most caterpillars to relocate to alternative host plants. The hawkmoth, <i>Manduca sexta</i> (Sphingidae), oviposits on solanaceous plants. Larvae hatching on a plant that is already attacked by conspecific caterpillars can face food competition, as well as an increased exposure to predators and induced plant defenses. Here, we show that feces from conspecific caterpillars are sufficient to deter a female <i>M. sexta</i> from ovipositing on a plant and that this deterrence is based on the feces-emitted carboxylic acids 3-methylpentanoic acid and hexanoic acid. Using a combination of genome editing (CRISPR-Cas9), electrophysiological recordings, calcium imaging, and behavioral analyses, we demonstrate that ionotropic receptor 8a (IR8a) is essential for acid-mediated feces avoidance in ovipositing hawkmoths.
