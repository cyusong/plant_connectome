['23837821', 'Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are a complex family of cell-wall proteoglycans  that are thought to play major roles in plant growth and development. Genetic  approaches to studying AGP function have met limited success so far, presumably  due to redundancy within the large gene families encoding AGP backbones. Here we  used an alternative approach for genetic dissection of the role of AGPs in  development by modifying their glycan side chains. We have identified an  Arabidopsis glycosyltransferase of CAZY family GT31 (AtGALT31A) that  galactosylates AGP side chains. A mutation in the AtGALT31A gene caused the  arrest of embryo development at the globular stage. The presence of the  transcript in the suspensor of globular-stage embryos is consistent with a role  for AtGALT31A in progression of embryo development beyond the globular stage. The  first observable defect in the mutant is perturbation of the formative asymmetric  division of the hypophysis, indicating an essential role for AGP proteoglycans in  either specification of the hypophysis or orientation of the asymmetric division  plane.', '2013 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12281', 'Mouille']
