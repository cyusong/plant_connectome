Plants are frequently exposed to a variety of abiotic stresses, such as those caused by salt, drought, cold, and heat. All of these stressors can induce changes in the proteoforms, which make up the proteome of an organism. Of the many different proteoforms, protein ubiquitination has attracted a lot of attention because it is widely involved in the process of protein degradation; thus regulates many plants molecular processes, such as hormone signal transduction, to resist external stresses. Ubiquitin ligases are crucial in substrate recognition during this ubiquitin modification process. In this review, the molecular mechanisms of plant responses to abiotic stresses from the perspective of ubiquitin ligases have been described. This information is critical for a better understanding of plant molecular responses to abiotic stresses.
