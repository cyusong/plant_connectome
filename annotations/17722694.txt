Chitin, found in the cell walls of true fungi and the exoskeleton of insects and nematodes, is a well-established elicitor of plant defense responses. In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor (TF) and ubiquitin-ligase genes in response to purified chitooctaose at different treatment times (15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after treatment), using both quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the Affymetrix Arabidopsis whole-genome array. A total of 118 TF genes and 30 ubiquitin-ligase genes were responsive to the chitin treatment. Among these genes, members from the following four TF families were overrepresented: APETALA2/ethylene-reponsive element binding proteins (27), C2H2 zinc finger proteins (14), MYB domain-containing proteins (11), and WRKY domain transcription factors (14). Transcript variants from a few of these genes were found to respond differentially to chitin, suggesting transcript-specific regulation of these TF genes.
