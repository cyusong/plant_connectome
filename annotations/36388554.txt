A sophisticated innate immune system based on diverse pathogen receptor genes (PRGs) evolved in the history of plant life. To reconstruct the direction and magnitude of evolutionary trajectories of a given gene family, it is critical to detect the ancestral signatures. The rearrangement of functional domains made up the diversification found in PRG repertoires. Structural rearrangement of ancient domains mediated the NB-LRR evolutionary path from an initial set of modular proteins. Events such as domain acquisition, sequence modification and temporary or stable associations are prominent among rapidly evolving innate immune receptors. Over time PRGs are continuously shaped by different forces to find their optimal arrangement along the genome. The immune system is controlled by a robust regulatory system that works at different scales. It is important to understand how the PRG interaction network can be adjusted to meet specific needs. The high plasticity of the innate immune system is based on a sophisticated functional architecture and multi-level control. Due to the complexity of interacting with diverse pathogens, multiple defense lines have been organized into interconnected groups. Genomic architecture, gene expression regulation and functional arrangement of PRGs allow the deployment of an appropriate innate immunity response.
