Sorbitol is a major photosynthate produced in leaves and transported through the phloem of apple (Malus domestica) and other tree fruits in Rosaceae. Sorbitol stimulates its own metabolism, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) is involved in regulating the sorbitol-responsive expression of both SORBITOL DEHYDROGENASE 1 (SDH1) and ALDOSE-6-PHOSPHATE REDUCTASE (A6PR), encoding two key enzymes in sorbitol metabolism. SnRK1 expression is increased by feeding of exogenous sorbitol but decreased by sucrose. SnRK1 interacts with and phosphorylates the bZIP transcription factor bZIP39. bZIP39 binds to the promoters of both SDH1 and A6PR and activates their expression. Overexpression of SnRK1 in 'Royal Gala' apple increases its protein level and activity, upregulating transcript levels of both SDH1 and A6PR without altering the expression of bZIP39. Of all the sugars tested, sorbitol is the only one that stimulates SDH1 and A6PR expression, and this stimulation is blocked by RNAi-induced repression of either SnRK1 or bZIP39. These findings reveal that sorbitol acts as a signal regulating its own metabolism via SnRK1-mediated phosphorylation of bZIP39, which integrates sorbitol signaling into the SnRK1-mediated sugar signaling network to modulate plant carbohydrate metabolism.
