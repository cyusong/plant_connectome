GARP transcription factors perform critical roles in plant development and response to environmental stimulus, especially in the phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) sensing and uptake. Spirodela polyrhiza (giant duckweed) is widely used for phytoremediation and biomass production due to its rapid growth and efficient N and P removal capacities. However, there has not yet been a comprehensive analysis of the GRAP gene family in S. polyrhiza. We conducted a comprehensive study of GRAP superfamily genes in S. polyrhiza. First, we investigated 35 SpGARP genes which have been classified into three groups based on their gene structures, conserved motifs, and phylogenetic relationship. Then, we identified the duplication events, performed the synteny analysis, and calculated the K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>s</sub> ratio in these SpGARP genes. The regulatory and co-expression networks of SpGARPs were further constructed using cis-acting element analysis and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Finally, the expression pattern of SpGARP genes were analyzed using RNA-seq data and qRT-PCR, and several NIGT1 transcription factors were found to be involved in both N and P starvation responses. The study provides insight into the evolution and function of GARP superfamily in S. polyrhiza, and lays the foundation for the further functional verification of SpGARP genes.
