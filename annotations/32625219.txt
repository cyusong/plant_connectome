Autophagy is a highly conserved system for degrading and recycling cytoplasmic components. The identification of autophagy-related (<i>ATG</i>) genes, required for autophagosome formation, has led to numerous studies using <i>atg</i> mutants. These studies have revealed the physiological significance of autophagy in various functions of diverse organisms. In land plants, autophagy is required for higher-order functions such as stress responses and development. Although defective autophagy does not result in any marked defect in the reproductive processes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> under laboratory conditions, several studies have shown that autophagy plays a pivotal role in male reproduction in several land plants. In this review, we aim to summarize information on the role of autophagy in male reproductive processes in land plants.
