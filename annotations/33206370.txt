The root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita secretes specific effectors (MiEFF) and induces the redifferentiation of plant root cells into enlarged multinucleate feeding 'giant cells' essential for nematode development. Immunolocalizations revealed the presence of the MiEFF18 protein in the salivary glands of M. incognita juveniles. In planta, MiEFF18 localizes to the nuclei of giant cells demonstrating its secretion during plant-nematode interactions. A yeast two-hybrid approach identified the nuclear ribonucleoprotein SmD1 as a MiEFF18 partner in tomato and Arabidopsis. SmD1 is an essential component of the spliceosome, a complex involved in pre-mRNA splicing and alternative splicing. RNA-seq analyses of Arabidopsis roots ectopically expressing MiEFF18 or partially impaired in SmD1 function (smd1b mutant) revealed the contribution of the effector and its target to alternative splicing and proteome diversity. The comparison with Arabidopsis galls data showed that MiEFF18 modifies the expression of genes important for giant cell ontogenesis, indicating that MiEFF18 modulates SmD1 functions to facilitate giant cell formation. Finally, Arabidopsis smd1b mutants exhibited less susceptibility to M. incognita infection, and the giant cells formed on these mutants displayed developmental defects, suggesting that SmD1 plays an important role in the formation of giant cells and is required for successful nematode infection.
