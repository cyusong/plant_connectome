Jacalin-related lectins (JRLs) are a new subfamily of plant lectins that has recently been recognized and plays an important role in plant growth, development, and abiotic stress response. Although moso bamboo (<i>Phyllostachys edulis</i>) is an economically and industrially important bamboo worldwide, there has been no systematic identification of JRLs in this species. Here, we identified 25 <i>JRL</i> genes in moso bamboo, and these genes are unequally distributed among 10 genome scaffolds. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the moso bamboo JRLs were clustered into four JRL subgroups: I, II, V, and VII. Numerous stress-responsive and hormone-regulated <i>cis</i>-elements were detected in the upstream promoter regions of the JRLs. Genome collinearity analyses showed that the <i>JRL</i> genes of moso bamboo are more closely related to those of <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> than to those of <i>Oryza sativa</i> and <i>Zea mays</i>. Sixty-four percent of the <i>PeJRL</i> genes are present as segmental and tandem duplicates. qRT-PCR expression analysis showed that <i>JRL</i> genes in the same subgroup were significantly downregulated in response to salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatments and significantly upregulated under low temperature, drought, and salt stress; they also exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns. Subcellular localization experiments revealed that <i>PeJRL04</i> and <i>PeJRL13</i> were localized to the cell membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasm. Three dimensional structure prediction and yeast two-hybrid assays were used to verify that <i>PeJRL13</i> exists as a self-interacting homodimer <i>in vivo</i>. These findings provide an important reference for understanding the functions of specific moso bamboo JRL genes and for the effective selection of stress-related genes.
