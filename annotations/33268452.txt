PHOSPHORYLETHANOLAMINE CYTIDYLYLTRANSFERASE 1 (PECT1) regulates phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis and controls the phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylcholine ratio in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Previous studies have suggested that PECT1 regulates flowering time by modulating the interaction between phosphatidylcholine and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a florigen, in the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Here, we show that knockdown of <i>PECT1</i> by artificial microRNA in the SAM (<i>pFD::amiR-PECT1</i>) accelerated flowering under inductive and even non-inductive conditions, in which <i>FT</i> transcription is almost absent, and in <i>ft-10 twin sister of ft-1</i> double mutants under both conditions. Transcriptome analyses suggested that PECT1 affects flowering by regulating <i>SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE</i> (<i>SVP</i>) and <i>GIBBERELLIN 20 OXIDASE 2</i> (<i>GA20ox2</i>). <i>SVP</i> misexpression in the SAM suppressed the early flowering of <i>pFD::amiR-PECT1</i> plants. <i>pFD::amiR-PECT1</i> plants showed increased gibberellin (GA) levels in the SAM, concomitant with the reduction of REPRESSOR OF GA1-3 levels. Consistent with this, GA treatment had little effect on flowering time of <i>pFD::amiR-PECT1</i> plants and the GA antagonist paclobutrazol strongly affected flowering in these plants. Together, these results suggest that PECT1 also regulates flowering time through a florigen-independent pathway, modulating <i>SVP</i> expression and thus regulating GA production.
