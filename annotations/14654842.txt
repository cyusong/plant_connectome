['14654842', "The underlying mechanism of circadian rhythmicity appears to be conserved among  organisms, and is based on negative transcriptional feedback loops forming a  cellular oscillator (or 'clock'). Circadian changes in protein stability,  phosphorylation and subcellular localization also contribute to the generation  and maintenance of this clock. In plants, several genes have been shown to be  closely associated with the circadian system. However, the molecular mechanisms  proposed to regulate the plant clock are mostly based on regulation at the  transcriptional level. Here we provide genetic and molecular evidence for a role  of ZEITLUPE (ZTL) in the targeted degradation of TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1  (TOC1) in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress). The physical interaction of TOC1  with ZTL is abolished by the ztl-1 mutation, resulting in constitutive levels of  TOC1 protein expression. The dark-dependent degradation of TOC1 protein requires  functional ZTL, and is prevented by inhibiting the proteosome pathway. Our  results show that the TOC1-ZTL interaction is important in the control of TOC1  protein stability, and is probably responsible for the regulation of circadian  period by the clock.", '2003 Dec 4', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature02163', 'Kay']
