Mimicry target-directed microRNA degradation is widespread and highly conserved among eukaryotes. However, little is known about its mechanism of action. In this letter, by using STTM160 (target mimic of miR160) as a reporter, we show that dysfunction of HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS) suppresses the pleiotropic phenotype of STTM160. Small RNA sequencing and Northern blot analyses suggested that HWS only affects a subset of microRNAs. Intriguingly, we identified a stable coexistence of miR160/miR399 and their mimicry targets within the AGO1 complex when HWS is compromised, pointing to a possible role of HWS in the clearance of RNA-induced silencing complexes associated with mimicry target.

HWS: !affects! subset of microRNAs
miR160/miR399: !coexist with! mimicry targets
HWS: !clears! RNA-induced silencing complexes
