The development of dwarf fruit trees with smaller and compact characteristics leads to significantly increased fruit production, which is a major objective of pear (<i>Pyrus bretschneideri</i>) breeding. We identified the S-acylation activity of <i>PbPAT14</i>, an S-acyltransferase gene related to plant development, using a yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) complementation assay, and also <i>PbPAT14</i> could rescue the growth defect of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> mutant <i>atpat14</i>. We further studied the function of <i>PbPAT14</i> by designing three guide RNAs for <i>PbPAT14</i> to use in the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We obtained 22 positive transgenic pear lines via <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation using cotyledons from seeds of <i>Pyrus betulifolia</i> ('Duli'). Six of these lines exhibited the dwarf yellowing phenotype and were homozygous mutations according to sequencing analysis. Ultrastructure analysis suggested that this dwarfism was manifested by shorter, thinner stems due to a reduction in cell number. A higher level of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and a higher transcript level of the ABA pathway genes in the mutant lines revealed that the <i>PbPAT14</i> function was related to the ABA pathway. Overall, our experimental results increase the understanding of how PATs function in plants and help elucidate the mechanism of plant dwarfism.
