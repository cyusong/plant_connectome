['9765416', 'During the systemic infection of plants by viruses, host factors play an  important role in supporting virus multiplication. To identify and characterize  the host factors involved in this process, we isolated an Arabidopsis thaliana  mutant named RB663, in which accumulation of the coat protein (CP) of cucumber  mosaic virus (CMV) in upper uninoculated leaves was delayed. Genetic analyses  suggested that the phenotype of delayed accumulation of CMV CP in RB663 plants  was controlled by a monogenic, recessive mutation designated cum2-1, which is  located on chromosome III and is distinct from the previously characterized cum1  mutation. Multiplication of CMV was delayed in inoculated leaves of RB663 plants,  whereas the multiplication in RB663 protoplasts was similar to that in wild-type  protoplasts. This suggests that the cum2-1 mutation affects the cell-to-cell  movement of CMV rather than CMV replication within a single cell. In RB663  plants, the multiplication of turnip crinkle virus (TCV) was also delayed but  that of tobacco mosaic virus was not affected. As observed with CMV, the  multiplication of TCV was normal in protoplasts and delayed in inoculated leaves  of RB663 plants compared to that in wild-type plants. Furthermore, the phenotype  of delayed TCV multiplication cosegregated with the cum2-1 mutation as far as we  examined. Therefore, the cum2-1 mutation is likely to affect the cell-to-cell  movement of both CMV and TCV, implying a common aspect to the mechanisms of  cell-to-cell movement in these two distinct viruses.', '1998 Nov', 'J Virol', '10.1128/JVI.72.11.8731-8737.1998', 'Naito']
