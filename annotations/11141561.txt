['11141561', 'Plant disease resistance (R) genes control the recognition of specific pathogens  and activate subsequent defense responses. We show that the Arabidopsis thaliana  locus RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW8 (RPW8) contains two naturally polymorphic,  dominant R genes, RPW8.1 and RPW8.2, which individually control resistance to a  broad range of powdery mildew pathogens. Although the predicted RPW8.1 and RPW8.2  proteins are different from the previously characterized R proteins, they induce  localized, salicylic acid-dependent defenses similar to those induced by R genes  that control specific resistance. Apparently, broad-spectrum resistance mediated  by RPW8 uses the same mechanisms as specific resistance.', '2001 Jan 5', 'Science', '10.1126/science.291.5501.118', 'Turner']
