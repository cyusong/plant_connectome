Drought stress imposes a serious threat to crop productivity and nutritional security. Drought adaptation mechanisms involve complex regulatory network comprising of various sensory and signaling molecules. In this context, melatonin has emerged as a potential signaling molecule playing a crucial role in imparting stress tolerance in plants. Melatonin pretreatment regulates various plant physiological processes such as osmoregulation, germination, photosynthesis, senescence, primary/secondary metabolism, and hormonal cross-talk under water deficit conditions. Melatonin-mediated regulation of ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle plays a crucial role to scavenge reactive oxygen species generated in the cells during drought. Here, in this review, the current knowledge on the role of melatonin to ameliorate adverse effects of drought by modulating morphological, physiological, and redox regulatory processes is discussed. The role of melatonin to improve water absorption capacity of roots by regulating aquaporin channels and hormonal cross-talk involved in drought stress mitigation are also discussed. Overall, melatonin is a versatile bio-molecule involved in growth promotion and yield enhancement under drought stress that makes it a suitable candidate for eco-friendly crop production to ensure food security.
