['18849574', 'Sphingoid long-chain base (LCB) 1-phosphates are degradated by LCB 1-phosphate  lyase to C(16) fatty aldehydes and phosphoethanolamine. Here, we confirmed that  the At1g27980 gene product, AtDPL1, is a functional LCB-1-phosphate lyase.  Expression of green fluorescent protein fusion products in suspension-cultured  Arabidopsis cells showed that AtDPL1 is located to the endoplasmic reticulum. The  rates of fresh weight decreases of dpl1-1 and dpl1-2 mutants were significantly  slower than those of the wild-type plants. This ability to limit their  transpiration reflected the leaf temperature of the mutant plants more than that  of wild-type plants, suggesting that AtDPL1 plays a role in dehydration stress.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcn149', 'Imai']
