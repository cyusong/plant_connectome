The fruit and seed produced by a small number of crop plants provide the majority of food eaten across the world. Given the growing global population, there is a pressing need to increase yields of these crops without using more land or more chemical inputs. Many of these crops display prominent 'fruit-flowering feedbacks', in which fruit produced early in sexual reproductive development can inhibit the production of further fruit by a range of mechanisms. Understanding and overcoming these feedbacks thus presents a plausible route to increasing crop yields 'for free'. In this review, we define three key types of fruit-flowering feedback, and examine how frequent they are and their effects on reproduction in a wide range of both wild and cultivated species. We then assess how these phenomenologically distinct phenomena might arise from conserved phytohormonal signalling events, particularly the export of auxin from growing organs. Finally, we offer some thoughts on the evolutionary basis for these self-limiting sexual reproductive patterns, and whether they are also present in the cereal crops that fundamentally underpin global diets.
