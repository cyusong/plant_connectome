Pathogenic fungi often target the plant plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase during infection. To identify pathogenic compounds targeting plant H<sup>+</sup> -ATPases, we screened extracts from 10 Stemphylium species for their effect on H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase activity. We identified Stemphylium loti extracts as potential H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase inhibitors, and through chemical separation and analysis, tenuazonic acid (TeA) as a potent H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase inhibitor. By assaying ATP hydrolysis and H<sup>+</sup> pumping, we confirmed TeA as a H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. To visualize in planta inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase, we treated pH-sensing Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings with TeA and quantified apoplastic alkalization. TeA affected both ATPase hydrolysis and H<sup>+</sup> pumping, supporting a direct effect on the H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase. We demonstrated apoplastic alkalization of A. thaliana seedlings after short-term TeA treatment, indicating that TeA effectively inhibits plant PM H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase in planta. TeA-induced inhibition was highly dependent on the regulatory C-terminal domain of the plant H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase. Stemphylium loti is a phytopathogenic fungus. Inhibiting the plant PM H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase results in membrane potential depolarization and eventually necrosis. The corresponding fungal H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase, PMA1, is less affected by TeA when comparing native preparations. Fungi are thus able to target an essential plant enzyme without causing self-toxicity.
