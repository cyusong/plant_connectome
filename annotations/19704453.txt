Extracellular Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases (CSDs) that catalyze the conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide have been suggested to be involved in lignification of secondary walls in spinach, pine and aspen. In cotton fibers, hydrogen peroxide was proposed to be involved in the induction of secondary cell wall biosynthesis. Recently, we identified extracellular CSDs from developing cotton fibers using both immunological and epitope tagging techniques. Since cotton fibers are not lignified, we suggested that extracellular CSDs may be involved in plant cell wall growth and development processes other than lignification. In this addendum, we have further characterized the extracellular CSD in cotton fiber. Immunoblots, enzyme activity assays, and transcript levels show that an extracellular CSD is present in elongating primary walls as well as thickening secondary walls of cotton fibers. Our working model proposes that extracellular hydrogen peroxide levels, regulated by redox status-related enzymes including extracellular CSDs and peroxidases, may affect the processes of wall loosening and wall tightening.
