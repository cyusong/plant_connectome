['11114200', 'Genetic screens have been performed to identify mutants with altered auxin  homeostasis in Arabidopsis. A tagged allele of the auxin-overproducing mutant  sur2 was identified within a transposon mutagenized population. The SUR2 gene was  cloned and shown to encode the CYP83B1 protein, which belongs to the large family  of the P450-dependent monooxygenases. SUR2 expression is up-regulated in sur1  mutants and induced by exogenous auxin in the wild type. Analysis of  indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) synthesis and metabolism in sur2 plants indicates that  the mutation causes a conditional increase in the pool size of IAA through  up-regulation of IAA synthesis.', '2000 Dec 19', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.260502697', 'Bellini']
