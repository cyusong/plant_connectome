Integration of light signaling and diverse abiotic stress responses contribute to plant survival in a changing environment. Some reports have indicated that light signals contribute a plant's ability to deal with heat, cold, and stress. However, the molecular link between light signaling and the salt-response pathways remains unclear. We demonstrate here that increasing light intensity elevates the salt stress tolerance of plants. Depletion of HY5, a key component of light signaling, causes Arabidopsis thaliana to become salinity sensitive. Interestingly, the small heat shock protein (sHsp) family genes are upregulated in hy5-215 mutant plants, and HsfA2 is commonly involved in the regulation of these sHsps. We found that HY5 directly binds to the G-box motifs in the HsfA2 promoter, with the cooperation of HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9 (HDA9), to repress its expression. Furthermore, the accumulation of HDA9 and the interaction between HY5 and HDA9 are significantly enhanced by salt stress. On the contrary, high temperature triggers HY5 and HDA9 degradation, which leads to dissociation of HY5-HDA9 from the HsfA2 promoter, thereby reducing salt tolerance. Under salt and heat stress conditions, fine tuning of protein accumulation and an interaction between HY5 and HDA9 regulate HsfA2 expression. This implies that HY5, HDA9, and HsfA2 play important roles in the integration of light signaling with salt stress and heat shock response.
