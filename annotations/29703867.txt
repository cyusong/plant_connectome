Phytohormones are physiologically important small molecules that play essential roles in intricate signaling networks that regulate diverse processes in plants. We present a method for the simultaneous targeted profiling of 101 phytohormone-related analytes from minute amounts of fresh plant material (less than 20 mg). Rapid and nonselective extraction, fast one-step sample purification, and extremely sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry enable concurrent quantification of the main phytohormone classes: cytokinins, auxins, brassinosteroids, gibberellins, jasmonates, salicylates, and abscisates. We validated this hormonomic approach in salt-stressed and control Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings, quantifying a total of 43 endogenous compounds in both root and shoot samples. Subsequent multivariate statistical data processing and cross-validation with transcriptomic data highlighted the main hormone metabolites involved in plant adaptation to salt stress.
