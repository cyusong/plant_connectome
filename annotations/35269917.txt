Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins (PAs) are vital secondary metabolites in Tartary buckwheat because of their antioxidant capacities and radical scavenging functions. It has been demonstrated that R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) are essential regulators of anthocyanin and PA biosynthesis in many plants. However, their regulatory mechanisms in Tartary buckwheat remain to be clarified. Here, we confirmed the role of FtMYB3 in anthocyanin and PA biosynthesis. FtMYB3, which belongs to the subgroup 4 R2R3 family was predominantly expressed in roots. The transcriptional expression of FtMYB3 increased significantly under hormone treatment with SA and MeJA and abiotic stresses including drought, salt, and cold at the seedling stage. Functional analyses showed that FtMYB3 negatively regulated anthocyanin and PA biosynthesis, primarily via downregulating the expression of the <i>DFR</i>, <i>ANS</i>, <i>BAN</i>, and <i>TT13</i> in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, which may depend on the interaction between FtMYB3 and FtbHLH/FtWD40. Altogether, this study reveals that FtMYB3 is a negative regulatory transcription factor for anthocyanin and PA biosynthesis in Tartary buckwheat.

FtMYB3: !regulates! anthocyanin and PA biosynthesis
FtMYB3: !interacts with! FtbHLH/FtWD40
FtMYB3: !downregulates! DFR, ANS, BAN, TT13
SA/MeJA: !induces! FtMYB3 expression
drought/salt/cold: !induces! FtMYB3 expression
