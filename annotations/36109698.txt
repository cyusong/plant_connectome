The cationic amino acid transporters (CAT) play indispensable roles in maintaining metabolic functions, such as synthesis of proteins and nitric oxide (NO), biosynthesis of polyamine, and flow of amino acids, by mediating the bidirectional transport of cationic amino acids in plant cells. In this study, we performed a genome-wide and comprehensive study of 79 CAT genes in four species of cotton. Localization of genes revealed that CAT genes reside on the plasma membrane. Seventy-nine CAT genes were grouped into 7 subfamilies by phylogenetic analysis. Structure analysis of genes showed that CAT genes from the same subgroup have similar genetic structure and exon number. RNA-seq and real-time PCR indicated that the expression of most GhCAT genes were induced by salt, drought, cold and heat stresses. Cis-elements analysis of GhCAT promoters showed that the GhCAT genes promoters mainly contained plant hormones responsive elements and abiotic stress elements, which indicated that GhCAT genes may play key roles in response to abiotic stress. Moreover, we also conducted gene interaction network of the GhCAT proteins. Silencing GhCAT10D expression decreased the resistance of cotton to salt stress because of a decrease in the accumulation of NO and proline. Our results indicated that CAT genes might be related with salt tolerance in cotton and lay a foundation for further study on the regulation mechanism of CAT genes in cationic amino acids transporting and distribution responsing to abiotic stress.
