['19304937', 'The relative significance of gene regulation and protein isovariant differences  remains unexplored for most gene families, particularly those participating in  multicellular development. Arabidopsis thaliana encodes three vegetative actins,  ACT2, ACT7, and ACT8, in two ancient and highly divergent subclasses. Mutations  in any of these differentially expressed actins revealed only mild phenotypes.  However, double mutants were extremely dwarfed, with altered cell and organ  morphology and an aberrant F-actin cytoskeleton (e.g., act2-1 act7-4 and act8-2  act7-4) or totally root-hairless (e.g., act2-1 act8-2). Our studies suggest that  the three vegetative actin genes and protein isovariants play distinct  subclass-specific roles during plant morphogenesis. For example, during root  development, ACT7 was involved in root growth, epidermal cell specification, cell  division, and root architecture, and ACT2 and ACT8 were essential for root hair  tip growth. Also, genetic complementation revealed that the ACT2 and ACT8  isovariants, but not ACT7, fully rescued the root hair growth defects of single  and double mutants. Moreover, we synthesized fully normal plants overexpressing  the ACT8 isovariant from multiple actin regulatory sequences as the only  vegetative actin in the act2-1 act7-4 background. In summary, it is evident that  differences in vegetative actin gene regulation and the diversity in actin  isovariant sequences are essential for normal plant development.', '2009 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.061960', 'Meagher']
