Conversion of light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis in the chloroplasts of photosynthetic organisms is essential for photoautotrophic growth, and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of excess light energy prevents the generation of reactive oxygen species and maintains efficient photosynthesis under high light. In the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, NPQ is activated as a photoprotective mechanism through wavelength-specific light signaling pathways mediated by the phototropin (blue light) and ultra-violet (UV) light photoreceptors, but the biological significance of photoprotection activation by light with different qualities remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that NPQ-dependent photoprotection is activated more rapidly by UV than by visible light. We found that induction of gene expression and protein accumulation related to photoprotection was significantly faster and greater in magnitude under UV treatment compared with that under blue- or red-light treatment. Furthermore, the action spectrum of UV-dependent induction of photoprotective factors implied that C. reinhardtii senses relatively long-wavelength UV (including UV-A/B), whereas the model dicot plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) preferentially senses relatively short-wavelength UV (mainly UV-B/C) for induction of photoprotective responses. Therefore, we hypothesize that C. reinhardtii developed a UV response distinct from that of land plants.
