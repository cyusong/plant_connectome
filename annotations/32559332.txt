The self-splicing of group II introns during RNA processing depends on their catalytic structure and is influenced by numerous factors that promote the formation of that structure through direct binding. Here we report that C-to-U editing at a specific position in two nad7 introns is essential to splicing, which also implies that the catalytic activity of non-functional group II introns could be restored by editing. We characterized a maize (Zea mays) mutant, dek46, with a defective kernel phenotype; Dek46 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat DYW protein exclusively localized in mitochondria. Analyses of the coding regions of mitochondrial transcripts did not uncover differences in RNA editing between dek46 mutant and wild-type maize, but showed that splicing of nad7 introns 3 and 4 is severely reduced in the mutant. Furthermore, editing at nucleotide 22 of domain 5 (D5-C22) of both introns is abolished in dek46. We constructed chimeric introns by swapping D5 of P.li.LSUI2 with D5 of nad7 intron 3. In vitro splicing assays indicated that the chimeric intron containing D5-U22 can be self-spliced, but the one containing D5-C22 cannot. These results indicate that DEK46 functions in the C-to-U editing of D5-C22 of both introns, and the U base at this position is critical to intron splicing.
