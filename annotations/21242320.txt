['21242320', 'The Arabidopsis Jasmonate ZIM-domain proteins (JAZs) act as substrates of  SCF(COI1) complex to repress their downstream targets, which are essential for  JA-regulated plant development and defense. The bHLH transcription factor MYC2  was found to interact with JAZs and mediate JA responses including JA-inhibitory  root growth. Here, we identified another bHLH transcription factor MYC3 which  directly interacted with JAZs by virtue of its N-terminal region to regulate JA  responses. The transgenic plants with overexpression of MYC3 exhibited  hypersensitivity in JA-inhibitory root elongation and seedling development. The  JAZ-interacting pattern and the JA-induced expression pattern of MYC3 were  distinguishable from those of MYC2. We speculate that MYC3 and MYC2 may have  redundant but also distinguishable functions in regulation of JA responses.', '2011 Mar', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssq073', 'Xie']
