The molecular mechanism of leaf senescence in apple (Malus domestica) is still not fully understood. We used gene expression analysis and protein-protein interactions to decipher the relationships of abscisic acid (ABA) and two proteins, MdbHLH93 and MdBT2, in the senescence process. We found that MdbHLH93 promoted leaf senescence and the expression of senescence-related genes, which exhibited similar effects to ABA on leaf senescence. MdbHLH93 activated directly the transcription of MdSAG18. We also found that an ABA-responsive protein, MdBT2, interacted directly with MdbHLH93, and induced the ubiquitination and degradation of the MdbHLH93 protein, and thus delayed leaf senescence. Our findings provide new insights into the regulatory network of leaf senescence through the functional interactions among ABA, MdbHLH93 and MdBT2.

ABA: !promotes! leaf senescence
MdbHLH93: !promotes! leaf senescence
MdbHLH93: !activates! MdSAG18
MdBT2: !interacts with! MdbHLH93
MdBT2: !induces! ubiquitination of MdbHLH93
