['29341143', "Sphingolipids, a class of bioactive lipids found in cell membranes, can modulate  the biophysical properties of the membranes and play a critical role in signal  transduction. Sphingolipids are involved in autophagy in humans and yeast, but  their role in autophagy in plants is not well understood. In this study, we  reported that the AtACER, an alkaline ceramidase that hydrolyses ceramide to  long-chain base (LCB), functions in autophagy process in Arabidopsis. Our  empirical data showed that the loss of AtACER inhibited autophagy, and its  overexpression promoted autophagy under nutrient, salinity, and oxidative  stresses. Interestingly, nitrogen deprivation significantly affected the  sphingolipid's profile in Arabidopsis thaliana, especially the LCBs. Furthermore,  the exogenous application of LCBs also induced autophagy. Our findings revealed a  novel function of AtACER, where it was found to involve in the autophagy process,  thus, playing a crucial role in the maintenance of a dynamic loop between  sphingolipids and autophagy for cellular homeostasis under various environmental  stresses.", '2018 Apr', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.13148', 'ORCID:']
