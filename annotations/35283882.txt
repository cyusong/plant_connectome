Recent unpredictable climate change is the main reason for the decline in rice yield. In particular, drought stress is a major constraint in reducing yield and quality for rice at rainfed agriculture areas, such as Asia and South America. CRISPR/Cas9 provides an effective solution for gene function study and molecular breeding due to specific editing of targeted genome sequences. In addition, CRISPR/Cas9 application can significantly reduce the time required to develop new cultivars with improved traits compared to conventional complex and time-consuming breeding. Here, drought-induced gene <i>Oryza sativa Senescence-associated protein</i> (<i>OsSAP</i>) was edited by CRISPR/Cas9. To investigate the possible role of <i>OsSAP</i> in drought stress, genome-editing plants were subjected to drought stress until the soil moisture content reached 20%, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging efficiency of genome-editing plants were decreased. When the genome-editing plants were subjected to drought stress, survival rate, shoot length, root length, content of chlorophyll number of tiller, and 1,000-grain weight decreased, and more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup> were detected in leaves. In addition, expression levels of several critical stress-related transcription factors were decreased in the <i>OsSAP</i> genome-editing plant. These results suggest that <i>OsSAP</i> function as a positive regulator during drought stress response in rice. We analyzed the expression of <i>OsSAP</i> and <i>Cas9</i> in T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> plants as well as T<sub>2</sub> seeds. As the course of generation advancement progressed, <i>Cas9</i> expression remained stable or weakened but the <i>OsSAP</i> expression was continuously removed from the T<sub>0</sub> plant. The coefficient of variation (CV) in both T<sub>1</sub> plants and T<sub>2</sub> seeds was lower than 5%. Overall, our results suggest that CRISPR/Cas9 could be a novel and important tool for efficiently generating specific and inheritable targeted genome editing in rice, with short breeding cycles.
