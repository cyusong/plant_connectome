The emission of floral volatiles requires coordinated expression of biosynthetic genes. In the regulatory network of the volatile benzenoid/phenylpropanoid pathway in Petunia hybrida two master regulators of the pathway have been identified. The R2R3-MYB transcription factor EMISSION OF BENZENOIDS II (EOBII) utilizes a specific MYB binding site to activate the expression of the R2R3-MYB ODORANT1 (ODO1). However, because EOBII is expressed early in flower development, when ODO1 is not, there must be other factors that play a role in regulating expression of ODO1. Through functional analyses of ODO1 promoter fragments from fragrant and non-fragrant flowers, we provide evidence for additional players and present a model for combinatorial regulation of ODO1 expression in Petunia.

EOBII: !activates! ODO1
EOBII: !regulates! ODO1 expression
ODO1: !promotes! emission of benzenoids
Fragrant/non-fragrant flowers: !influence! ODO1 expression
