['18508955', 'Synthesis and accumulation of seed storage proteins (SSPs) is an important aspect  of the seed maturation program. Genes encoding SSPs are specifically and highly  expressed in the seed during maturation. However, the mechanisms that repress the  expression of these genes in leaf tissue are not well understood. To gain insight  into the repression mechanisms, we performed a genetic screen for mutants that  express SSPs in leaves. Here, we show that mutations affecting BRAHMA (BRM), a  SNF2 chromatin-remodeling ATPase, cause ectopic expression of a subset of SSPs  and other embryogenesis-related genes in leaf tissue. Consistent with the notion  that such SNF2-like ATPases form protein complexes in vivo, we observed similar  phenotypes for mutations of AtSWI3C, a BRM-interacting partner, and BSH, a SNF5  homolog and essential SWI/SNF subunit. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments  show that BRM is recruited to the promoters of a number of embryogenesis genes in  wild-type leaves, including the 2S genes, expressed in brm leaves. Consistent  with its role in nucleosome remodeling, BRM appears to affect the chromatin  structure of the At2S2 promoter. Thus, the BRM-containing chromatin-remodeling  ATPase complex involved in many aspects of plant development mediates the  repression of SSPs in leaf tissue.', '2008 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.121996', 'Cui']
