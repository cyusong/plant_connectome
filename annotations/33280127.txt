Salinity and drought conditions commonly result in osmotic and oxidative stresses, while salinity additionally causes ionic stress. In this study, we identified specific genes regulated by osmotic and ionic stresses in five Arabidopsis ecotypes. Shahdara (SHA) and C24 ecotypes were more tolerant to salt and drought stresses at the seedling growth stage, as evidenced by lower water loss rate, lower electrolyte leakage, and higher survival rate when compared to the other three ecotypes under drought and salinity conditions. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 3700 and 2242 genes were differentially regulated by salt and osmotic stresses, respectively. Totally 78.1% of upregulated and 62.0% of downregulated genes by osmotic stress were also commonly regulated by salt stress. Gene ontology term enrichment analysis showed that auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid, cytokinin, and gibberellic acid pathways were regulated by the osmotic stress, while IAA, jasmonic acid, and ethylene pathways were changed by the ionic stress. The nutrient and water uptake pathways were regulated by both the osmotic and ionic stresses, whereas ion transportation and kinase pathways were modulated by the ionic stress. Additionally, we characterized bHLH61 as a negative regulator in response to salt and drought stresses. This study provided new clues of plant responses to salt and drought stresses.
