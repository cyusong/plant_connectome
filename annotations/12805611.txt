['12805611', 'The superfamily of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding (Lhc) proteins in  higher plants and green algae is composed of more than 20 different antenna  proteins associated either with photosystem I (PSI) or photosystem II (PSII).  Several distant relatives of this family with conserved chlorophyll-binding  residues and proposed photoprotective functions are induced transiently under  various stress conditions. Whereas "classical" Lhc proteins contain  three-transmembrane alpha-helices, their distant relatives span the membrane with  between one and four transmembrane segments. Here, we report the identification  and isolation of a novel member of the Lhc family from Arabidopsis with one  predicted transmembrane alpha-helix closely related to helix I of Lhc protein  from PSI (Lhca4) that we named Ohp2 (for a second one-helix protein of Lhc family  described from higher plants). We showed that the Ohp2 gene expression is  triggered by light stress and that the Ohp2 transcript and protein accumulated in  a light intensity-dependent manner. Other stress conditions did not up-regulate  the expression of the Ohp2 gene. Localization studies revealed that Ohp2 is  associated with PSI under low- or high-light conditions. Because all  stress-induced Lhc relatives reported so far were found in PSII, we propose that  the accumulation of Ohp2 might represent a novel photoprotective strategy induced  within PSI in response to light stress.', '2003 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.102.019281', 'Adamska']
