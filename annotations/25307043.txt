['25307043', "Organellar reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling is a key mechanism that  promotes the onset of defensive measures in stress-exposed plants. The underlying  molecular mechanisms and feedback regulation loops, however, still remain poorly  understood. Our previous work has shown that a specific regulatory B'gamma subunit of  protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is required to control organellar ROS signalling  and associated metabolic adjustments in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we addressed  the mechanisms through which PP2A-B'gamma impacts on organellar metabolic crosstalk  and ROS homeostasis in leaves. Genetic, biochemical and pharmacological  approaches, together with a combination of data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and  selected reaction monitoring (SRM) MS techniques, were utilized to assess  PP2A-B'gamma-dependent adjustments in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that PP2A-B'gamma  physically interacts with the cytoplasmic form of aconitase, a central metabolic  enzyme functionally connected with mitochondrial respiration, oxidative stress  responses and regulation of cell death in plants. Furthermore, PP2A-B'gamma impacts  ROS homeostasis by controlling the abundance of specific alternative oxidase  isoforms, AOX1A and AOX1D, in leaf mitochondria. We conclude that  PP2A-B'gamma-dependent regulatory actions modulate the functional status of metabolic  enzymes that essentially contribute to intracellular ROS signalling and metabolic  homeostasis in plants.", '2015 Feb', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13097', 'Kangasjarvi']
