['21950843', 'Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) is the generic name of a class of lipid-soluble electron  carriers formed of a redox active benzoquinone ring attached to a prenyl side  chain. The length of the latter varies among species, and depends upon the  product specificity of a trans-long-chain prenyl diphosphate synthase that  elongates an allylic diphosphate precursor. In Arabidopsis, this enzyme is  assumed to correspond to an endoplasmic reticulum-located solanesyl diphosphate  synthase, although direct genetic evidence was lacking. In this study, the  reconstruction of the functional network of Arabidopsis genes linked to  ubiquinone biosynthesis singled out an unsuspected solanesyl diphosphate synthase  candidate--product of gene At2g34630--that, extraordinarily, had been shown  previously to be targeted to plastids and to contribute to the biosynthesis of  gibberellins. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion experiments in tobacco and  Arabidopsis, and complementation of a yeast coq1 knockout lacking mitochondrial  hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase demonstrated that At2g34630 is also targeted to  mitochondria. At2g34630 is the main--if not sole--contributor to solanesyl  diphosphate synthase activity required for the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, as  demonstrated by the dramatic (75-80%) reduction of the ubiquinone pool size in  corresponding RNAi lines. Overexpression of At2g34630 gave up to a 40% increase  in ubiquinone content compared to wild-type plants. None of the silenced or  overexpressing lines, in contrast, displayed altered levels of plastoquinone.  Phylogenetic analyses revealed that At2g34630 is the only Arabidopsis  trans-long-chain prenyl diphosphate synthase that clusters with the Coq1  orthologs involved in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone in other eukaryotes.', '2012 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04796.x', 'Basset']
