<i>Venturia nashicola</i>, the cause of scab disease of Asian pears, is a host-specific, biotrophic fungus. It is restricted to Asia and is regarded as a quarantine threat outside this region. European pear displays nonhost resistance (NHR) to <i>V. nashicola</i> and Asian pears are nonhosts of <i>V. pyrina</i> (the cause of European pear scab disease). The host specificity of these two fungi is likely governed by differences in their effector arsenals, with a subset hypothesized to activate NHR. The <i>Pyrus-Venturia</i> pathosystem provides an opportunity to dissect the underlying genetics of nonhost interactions in this potentially more durable form of resistance. The <i>V. nashicola</i> genome will enable comparisons to other <i>Venturia</i> spp. genomes to identify effectors that potentially activate NHR in the pear scab pathosystem.
