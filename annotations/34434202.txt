The manganese (Mn) tracking factor for mitochondrial Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) has been annotated as yMTM1 in yeast, which belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family. We confirmed that <i>Arabidopsis</i> AtMTM1 and AtMTM2 are functional homologs of yMTM1 as they can revive yeast MnSOD activity in <i>yMTM1</i>-mutant cells. Transient expression of AtMnSOD-3xFLAG in the <i>AtMTM1</i> and <i>AtMTM2</i>-double mutant protoplasts confirmed that AtMTM1 and AtMTM2 are required for AtMnSOD activation. Our study revealed that AtMnSOD interacts with AtMTM1 and AtMTM2 in the mitochondria. The expression levels of <i>AtMTM1</i>, <i>AtMTM2</i>, and <i>AtMnSOD</i> respond positively to methyl viologen (MV) and metal stress. AtMTM1 and AtMTM2 are involved in Mn and Fe homeostasis, root length, and flowering time. Transient expression of chloroplast-destined AtMnSOD revealed that an evolutionarily conserved activation mechanism, like the chloroplastic-localized MnSOD in some algae, still exists in <i>Arabidopsis</i> chloroplasts. This study strengthens the proposition that AtMTM1 and AtMTM2 participate in the AtMnSOD activation and ion homeostasis.
