We investigated the responses of stomata to light in the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris, a typical species of Leptosporangiopsida. Stomata in the intact leaves of the sporophytes opened in response to red light, but they did not open when blue light was superimposed on the red light. The results were confirmed in the isolated Adiantum epidermis. The red light-induced stomatal response was not affected by the mutation of phy3, a chimeric protein of phytochrome and phototropin in this fern. The lack of a blue light-specific stomatal response was observed in three other fern species of Leptosporangiopsida, i.e. Pteris cretica, Asplenium scolopendrium and Nephrolepis auriculata. Fusicoccin, an activator of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase, induced both stomatal opening and H(+) release in the Adiantum epidermis. Adiantum phototropin genes AcPHOT1 and AcPHOT2 were expressed in the fern guard cells. The transformation of an Arabidopsis phot1 phot2 double mutant, which lost blue light-specific stomatal opening, with AcPHOT1 restored the stomatal response to blue light. Taken together, these results suggest that ferns of Leptosporangiopsida lack a blue light-specific stomatal response, although the functional phototropin and plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase are present in this species.
