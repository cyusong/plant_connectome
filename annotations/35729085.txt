Sugar efflux from host plants is essential for pathogen survival and proliferation. Sugar transporter-mediated redistribution of host sugar contributes to the outcomes of plant-pathogen interactions. However, few studies have focused on how sugar translocation is strategically manipulated during host colonization. To elucidate this question, the wheat sugar transport protein (STP) TaSTP3 responding to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) infection was characterized for sugar transport properties in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its potential role during Pst infection by RNA interference and overexpression in wheat. In addition, the transcription factors regulating TaSTP3 expression were further determined. The results showed that TaSTP3 is localized to the plasma membrane and functions as a sugar transporter of hexose and sucrose. TaSTP3 confers enhanced wheat susceptibility to Pst, and overexpression of TaSTP3 resulted in increased sucrose accumulation and transcriptional suppression of defense-related genes. Furthermore, TaWRKY19, TaWRKY61 and TaWRKY82 were identified as positive transcriptional regulators of TaSTP3 expression. Our findings reveal that the Pst-induced sugar transporter TaSTP3 is transcriptionally activated by TaWRKY19/61/82 and facilitates wheat susceptibility to stripe rust possibly through elevated sucrose concentration, and suggest TaSTP3 as a strong target for engineering wheat resistance to stripe rust.
