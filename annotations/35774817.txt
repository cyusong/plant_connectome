The rhizospheric microbial community affects the population establishment of invasive plants in introduced areas, among which <i>Bacillus</i> has numerous functions in promoting plant growth. This study isolated and enriched the <i>Bacillus</i> community in the rhizospheric soil of the invasive plant <i>Ageratina adenophora</i> and the native accompanying plant <i>Rabdosia amethystoides</i>. The effects of these rhizospheric <i>Bacillus</i> communities on the growth and competition of <i>A. adenophora</i> and <i>R. amethystoides</i> were evaluated in pot experiments. The results showed that the number and diversity of <i>Bacillus</i> in the rhizospheric soil of <i>A. adenophora</i> were higher than those of <i>R. amethystoides</i> (<i>A. adenophora</i>: 122 strains in soil, 16 <i>Bacillus</i> taxa; <i>R. amethystoides</i>: 88 strains in soil, 9 <i>Bacillus</i> taxa). After <i>Bacillus</i> inoculation of <i>A. adenophora</i> in a pot experiment, <i>Bacillus idriensis</i>, <i>Bacillus toyonensis</i> and <i>Bacillus cereus</i> were accumulated in the rhizospheric of <i>A. adenophora</i>, which significantly increased the nitrate nitrogen (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>-N) content in the soil and the total carbon and nitrogen concentrations in <i>A. adenophora</i> in the mixed treatment. The selective accumulation of <i>Bacillus</i> enhanced the competitive advantage of <i>A. adenophora</i> over the native accompanying plant; the corrected index of relative competition intensity of <i>A</i>. <i>adenophora</i>-inoculated <i>Bacillus</i> reached double that of the uninoculated treatment, and the growth of native plants was greatly suppressed under mixed planting. Our study confirmed that invasion of <i>A. adenophora</i> can lead to the accumulation of specific <i>Bacillus</i> taxa in the rhizospheric soil, which in turn can increase the competitive advantage of <i>A. adenophora</i>.
