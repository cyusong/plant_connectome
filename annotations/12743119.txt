['12743119', 'AGL15 (for AGAMOUS-like 15) is currently the only reported member of the plant  MADS domain family of transcriptional regulators that preferentially accumulates  during embryo development. Additionally, AGL15 is one of the more divergent  members of the MADS domain family, including within the DNA-binding domain.  Previous studies have shown that MADS domain proteins bind to DNA sequences with  an overall consensus of CC(A/T)6GG (called a CArG motif). Nonetheless, different  MADS domain proteins exhibit similar yet distinct binding site preferences that  may be critical for differential gene regulation. To determine the consensus  sequence preferentially bound by AGL15 in vitro, PCR-assisted binding site  selection assays were performed. AGL15 was observed to prefer a CArG motif with a  longer A/T-rich core and is to date the only plant MADS domain protein having  such a preference. Next, the Arabidopsis genome data base was searched for genes  containing AGL15 binding sites as candidates for direct regulation by AGL15. One  gene, DTA4 (for Downstream Target of AGL15-4), was identified by this method, and  then confirmed as a direct target of AGL15 in vivo.', '2003 Jul 25', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M212976200', 'Perry']
