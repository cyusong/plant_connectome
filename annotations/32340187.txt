Recent studies have shown various metabolic and transcriptomic interactions between sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) in plants. However, most studies have focused on the effects of phosphate (Pi) availability and P signaling pathways on S homeostasis, whereas the effects of S availability on P homeostasis remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the interactions between S and P from the perspective of S availability. We investigated the effects of S availability on Pi uptake, transport, and accumulation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> grown under sulfur sufficiency (+S) and deficiency (-S). Total P in shoots was significantly increased under -S owing to higher Pi accumulation. This accumulation was facilitated by increased Pi uptake under -S. In addition, -S increased root-to-shoot Pi transport, which was indicated by the increased Pi levels in xylem sap under -S. The -S-increased Pi level in the xylem sap was diminished in the disruption lines of <i>PHT1;9</i> and <i>PHO1</i>, which are involved in root-to-shoot Pi transport. Our findings indicate a new aspect of the interaction between S and P by listing the increased Pi accumulation as part of -S responses and by highlighting the effects of -S on Pi uptake, transport, and homeostasis.

S: !increases! Pi uptake
S: !enhances! root-to-shoot Pi transport
PHT1;9: !diminishes! -S-increased Pi level in xylem sap
PHO1: !diminishes! -S-increased Pi level in xylem sap
