Ozone is a strong oxidant and a key stress elicitor. The immediate and longer term impacts of ozone are poorly understood in species with emission of both de novo synthesized and stored volatiles, such a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), which has terpene-containing glandular trichomes on the leaf surface. In this study, we exposed N. tabacum 'Wisconsin' leaves to acute ozone doses of 0 (control), 400, 600, 800, and 1000 ppb for 30 min and studied the effects of ozone exposure on ozone uptake, gas-exchange characteristics, and emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. Foliage emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles were quantitatively related to the severity of ozone exposure, but the stress dose vs. emission relationship was weaker for terpenoids. Analysis of leaf terpene content and composition indicated that several monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were not stored in leaves and were synthesized de novo upon ozone exposure. The highest degree of elicitation for each compound was observed immediately after ozone treatment and it declined considerably during recovery. Leaf ozone uptake was dominated by non-stomatal deposition, and the emissions of total lipoxygenase pathway volatiles and mono- and sesquiterpenes were positively correlated with non-stomatal ozone deposition. Overall, this study demonstrates remarkably high ozone resistance of the studied tobacco cultivar and indicates that ozone's effects on volatile emissions primarily reflect modifications in the release of stored volatiles and reaction of ozone with the leaf surface structure.
