Chromatin is a highly organized structure with repetitive nucleosome subunits. Nucleosome distribution patterns, which contain information on epigenetic controls, are dynamically affected by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors (remodelers). However, whether plants have specific nucleosome distribution patterns and how plant remodelers contribute to the pattern formation are not clear. In this study we used the micrococcal nuclease digestion followed by deep sequencing (MNase-seq) assay to show the genome-wide nucleosome pattern in Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrated that the nucleosome distribution patterns of Arabidopsis are associated with the gene expression level, and have several specific characteristics that are different from those of animals and yeast. In addition, we found that remodelers in the A. thaliana imitation switch (AtISWI) subfamily are important for the formation of the nucleosome distribution pattern. Double mutations in the AtISWI genes, CHROMATIN REMODELING 11 (CHR11) and CHR17, resulted in the loss of the evenly spaced nucleosome pattern in gene bodies, but did not affect nucleosome density, supporting a previous idea that the primary role of ISWI is to slide nucleosomes in gene bodies for pattern formation.
