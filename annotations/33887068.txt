The role of the nucleolus in plant response to heat stress remains largely obscure. Our current efforts focused on exploring the underlying mechanism by which nucleolar disorganization is regulated in heat stressed-maize lines. Here, two maize lines, a heat-sensitive line, ZD958, and a heat-tolerant line, ZDH, were submitted to heat stress for investigating their association with the nucleolar disruption. Immunofluorescence staining showed that nucleolar disruption increased with prolonged treatment time. After heat treatment, a significant change in nucleolus organization was observed in the ZD958 line, but the ZDH line showed mild alteration. Moreover, actinomycin D (ActD)-induced nucleolus fission led to inhibition of maize growth under the normal condition. The ZD958 line exhibited a significant increase in the level of H3K9ac and H4K5ac of the 45S rDNA accompanied by a higher transcription of the 5'-external transcribed spacer (ETS) region, while the line ZDH showed a slight increase in histone acetylation levels and the transcriptional initiation at this site after heat treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report providing a comparative insight between heat stress, rDNA histone modifications, and nucleolus disintegration in a heat-tolerant ZDH compared with a heat-sensitive line ZD958. Our investigation might assist maize breeders in obtaining heat-tolerant lines by targeting nucleoli using epigenetics.
