Axillary meristems allow the production of secondary growth axes in the shoot systems of plants. As such they make a large contribution to the plastic developmental potential of plants, allowing them to alter their architecture to suit the prevailing environment conditions. This review focuses on the formation and activity of axillary meristems, across several model species. Current topics and problems in the field are discussed.
