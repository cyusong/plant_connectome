Nitrate serves as a potent signal to control gene expression in plants and algae, but little is known about the signaling role of nitrite, the direct product of nitrate reduction. Analysis of several nitrate-induced genes showed that nitrite increases mRNA levels as rapidly as nitrate in nitrogen-starved Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots. Both nitrite and nitrate induction are apparent at concentrations as low as 100 nm. The response at low nitrite concentrations was not due to contaminating nitrate, which was present at <1% of the nitrite concentration. High levels of ammonium (20 mm) in the growth medium suppressed induction of several genes by nitrate, but had varied effects on the nitrite response. Transcriptome analysis using 250 or 5 microm nitrate or nitrite showed that over one-half of the nitrate-induced genes, which included genes involved in nitrate and ammonium assimilation, energy production, and carbon and nitrogen metabolism responded equivalently to nitrite; however, the nitrite response was more robust and there were many genes that responded specifically to nitrite. Thus, nitrite can serve as a signal as well as if not better than nitrate.
