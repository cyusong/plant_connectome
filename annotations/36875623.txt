Groundnut or peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) is a legume crop. Its seeds are rich in protein and oil. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH, EC: 1.2.1.3) is an important enzyme involved in detoxification of aldehyde and cellular reactive oxygen species, as well as in attenuation of lipid peroxidation-meditated cellular toxicity under stress conditions. However, few studies have been identified and analyzed about ALDH members in <i>Arachis hypogaea</i>. In the present study, 71 members of the ALDH superfamily (AhALDH) were identified using the reference genome obtained from the Phytozome database. A systematic analysis of the evolutionary relationship, motif, gene structure, <i>cis</i>-acting elements, collinearity, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, and expression patterns was conducted to understand the structure and function of <i>AhALDH</i>s. <i>AhALDH</i>s exhibited tissue-specific expression, and quantitative real-time PCR identified significant differences in the expression levels of <i>AhALDH</i> members under saline-alkali stress. The results revealed that some <i>AhALDHs</i> members could be involved in response to abiotic stress. Our findings on <i>AhALDHs</i> provide insights for further study.
