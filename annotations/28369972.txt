['28369972', "Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors are involved in a wide range  of developmental processes and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. They  represent one of the biggest families of transcription factors but only few of  them have been functionally characterized. Here we report the characterization of  AtbHLH68 and show that, although the knock out mutant did not have an obvious  development phenotype, it was slightly more sensitive to drought stress than the  Col-0, and AtbHLH68 overexpressing lines displayed defects in lateral root (LR)  formation and a significant increased tolerance to drought stress, likely related  to an enhanced sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and/or increased ABA content.  AtbHLH68 was expressed in the vascular system of Arabidopsis and its expression  was modulated by exogenously applied ABA in an organ-specific manner. We showed  that the expression of genes involved in ABA metabolism [AtAAO3 (AtALDEHYDE  OXIDASE 3) and AtCYP707A3 (AtABSCISIC ACID 8'HYDROXYLASE 3)], in ABA-related  response to drought-stress (AtMYC2, AtbHLH122 and AtRD29A) or during LRs  development (AtMYC2 and AtABI3) was de-regulated in the overexpressing lines. We  propose that AtbHLH68 has a function in the regulation of LR elongation, and in  the response to drought stress, likely through an ABA-dependent pathway by  regulating directly or indirectly components of ABA signaling and/or metabolism.", '2017 Jul', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/ppl.12549', 'Bellini']
