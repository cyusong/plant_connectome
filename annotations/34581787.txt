Plant-derived volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play pivotal roles in interactions with insect herbivores. Individual VOCs can be directly toxic or deterrent, serve as signal molecules to attract natural enemies, and/or be perceived by distal plant tissues as a priming signal to prepare for expected herbivory. Environmental conditions, as well as the specific plant-insect interaction being investigated, strongly influence the observed functions of VOC blends. The complexity of plant-insect chemical communication via VOCs is further enriched by the sophisticated molecular perception mechanisms of insects, which can respond to one or more VOCs and thereby influence insect behavior in a manner that has yet to be fully elucidated. Despite numerous gaps in the current understanding of VOC-mediated plant-insect interactions, successful pest management strategies such as push-pull systems, synthetic odorant traps, and crop cultivars with modified VOC profiles have been developed to supplement chemical pesticide applications and enable more sustainable agricultural practices. Future studies in this field would benefit from examining the responses of both plants and insects in the same experiment to gain a more complete view of these interactive systems. Furthermore, a molecular evolutionary study of key genetic elements of the ecological interaction phenotypes could provide new insights into VOC-mediated plant communication with insect herbivores.
