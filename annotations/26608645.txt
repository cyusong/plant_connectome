Calcium (Ca(2+)) mobilization is a central theme in various plant signal transduction pathways. We demonstrate that Arabidopsis thaliana cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2 (AtCNGC2) is involved in jasmonic acid (JA)-induced apoplastic Ca(2+) influx in Arabidopsis epidermal cells. Ca(2+) imaging results showed that JA can induce an elevation in the cytosolic cAMP concentration ([cAMP]cyt), reaching a maximum within 3 min. Dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP), a cell membrane-permeable analogue of cAMP, induced an increase in the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]cyt), with a peak at 4 min. This [Ca(2+)]cyt increase was triggered by the JA-induced increase in [cAMP]cyt. W-7[N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide], an antagonist of calmodulin, positively modulated the JA-induced increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt, while W-5[N-(6-aminohexyl)-1-naphthalenesulfonamide], an inactive antagonist of calmodulin, had no apparent effect. db-cAMP and JA positively induced the expression of primary (i.e. JAZ1 and MYC2) and secondary (i.e. VSP1) response genes in the JA signalling pathway in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas they had no significant effect in the AtCNGC2 mutant 'defense, no death (dnd1) plants. These data provide evidence that JA first induces the elevation of cAMP, and cAMP, as an activating ligand, activates the AtCNGC2 channel, resulting in apoplastic Ca(2+) influx through AtCNGC2.
