['28956754', "AtHB1 is an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homeodomain-leucine zipper  transcription factor that participates in hypocotyl elongation under short-day  conditions. Here, we show that its expression is posttranscriptionally regulated  by an upstream open reading frame (uORF) located in its 5' untranslated region.  This uORF encodes a highly conserved peptide (CPuORF) that is present in varied  monocot and dicot species. The Arabidopsis uORF and its maize (Zea mays) homolog  repressed the translation of the main open reading frame in cis, independent of  the sequence of the latter. Published ribosome footprinting results and the  analysis of a frame-shifted uORF, in which the repression capability was lost,  indicated that the uORF causes ribosome stalling. The regulation exerted by the  CPuORF was tissue specific and did not act in the absence of light. Moreover, a  photosynthetic signal is needed for the CPuORF action, since plants with  uncoupled chloroplasts did not show uORF-dependent repression. Plants transformed  with the native AtHB1 promoter driving AtHB1 expression did not show differential  phenotypes, whereas those transformed with a construct in which the uORF was  mutated exhibited serrated leaves, compact rosettes, and, most significantly,  short nondehiscent anthers and siliques containing fewer or no seeds. Thus, we  propose that the uncontrolled expression of AtHB1 is deleterious for the plant  and, hence, finely repressed by a translational mechanism.", '2017 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.01060', 'ORCID:']
