['9724821', 'One-fifth of the tRNAs used in plant mitochondrial translation is coded for by  chloroplast-derived tRNA genes. To understand how aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have  adapted to the presence of these tRNAs in mitochondria, we have cloned an  Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA coding for a methionyl-tRNA synthetase. This enzyme was  chosen because chloroplast-like elongator tRNAMet genes have been described in  several plant species, including A. thaliana. We demonstrate here that the  isolated cDNA codes for both the chloroplastic and the mitochondrial  methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS). The protein is transported into isolated  chloroplasts and mitochondria and is processed to its mature form in both  organelles. Transient expression assays using the green fluorescent protein  demonstrated that the N-terminal region of the MetRS is sufficient to address the  protein to both chloroplasts and mitochondria. Moreover, characterization of  MetRS activities from mitochondria and chloroplasts of pea showed that only one  MetRS activity exists in each organelle and that both are indistinguishable by  their behavior on ion exchange and hydrophobic chromatographies. The high degree  of sequence similarity between A. thaliana and Synechocystis MetRS strongly  suggests that the A. thaliana MetRS gene described here is of chloroplast origin.', '1998 Sep 1', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.95.18.11014', 'Wintz']
