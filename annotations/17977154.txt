['17977154', 'Basal resistance is the ultimately unsuccessful plant defense response to  infection with a virulent pathogen. It is thought to be triggered by host  recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, with subsequent  suppression of particular components by pathogen effectors. To identify novel  components of Arabidopsis basal resistance against the bacterial pathogen  Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, microarray expression profiling was carried out  on the cirl mutant, which displays enhanced resistance against P. syringae pv.  tomato. This identified two genes, At4g23810 and At2g40000, encoding the  transcription factor WRKY53 and the nematode resistance protein-like HSPRO2,  whose expression was upregulated in cir1 prior to pathogen infection and in  wild-type plants after P. syringae pv. tomato infection. WRKY53 and HSPRO2 are  positive regulators of basal resistance. Knockout mutants of both genes were more  susceptible to P. syringae pv. tomato infection than complemented lines, with  increased growth of the pathogen in planta. WRKY53 and HSPRO2 appear to function  downstream of salicylic acid and to be negatively regulated by signaling through  jasmonic acid and ethylene.', '2007 Nov', 'Mol Plant Microbe Interact', '10.1094/MPMI-20-11-1431', 'Denby']
