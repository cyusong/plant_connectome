AtKinesin-13A is an internal-motor kinesin from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Previous immunofluorescent results showed that AtKinesin-13A localized to Golgi stacks in plant cells. However, its precise localization and biological function in Golgi apparatus is unclear. In this paper, immunofluorescent labeling and confocal microscopic observation revealed that AtKinesin-13A was co-localized with Golgi stacks in Arabidopsis root tip cells. Immuno-electron microscopic observations indicated that AtKinesin-13A is primarily localized on Golgi-associated vesicles in Arabidopsis root-cap cells. By T-DNA insertion, the inactivation of the AtKinesin-13A gene (NM-112536) resulted in a sharp decrease of size and number of Golgi vesicles in root-cap peripheral cells. At the same time, these cells were vacuolated in comparison to the corresponding cells of the wild type. These results suggest that AtKinesin-13A decorates Golgi-associated vesicles and may be involved in regulating the formation of Golgi vesicles in the root-cap peripheral cells in Arabidopsis.
