['26310197', 'Cell proliferation is a fundamental event essential for plant organogenesis and  contributes greatly to the final organ size. Although the control of cell  proliferation in plants has been extensively studied, how the plant sets the cell  number required for a single organ is largely elusive. Here, we describe the  Arabidopsis SMALL ORGAN 4 (SMO4) that functions in the regulation of cell  proliferation rate and thus final organ size. The smo4 mutant exhibits a reduced  size of organs due to the decreased cell number, and further analysis reveals  that such phenotype results from a retardation of the cell cycle progression  during organ development. SMO4 encodes a homolog of NUCLEOLAR PROTEIN 53 (NOP53)  in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and is expressed primarily in tissues undergoing cell  proliferation. Nevertheless, further complementation tests show that SMO4 could  not rescue the lethal defect of NOP53 mutant of S. cerevisiae. These results  define SMO4 as an important regulator of cell proliferation during organ growth  and suggest that SMO4 might have been evolutionarily divergent from NOP53.', '2015 Oct', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.12424', 'Hu']
