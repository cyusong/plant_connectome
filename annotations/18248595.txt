['18248595', 'The Arabidopsis mutant downy mildew resistant 6 (dmr6) carries a recessive  mutation that results in the loss of susceptibility to Hyaloperonospora  parasitica. Here we describe the map-based cloning of DMR6 (At5g24530), which was  found to encode a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-Fe(II) oxygenase of unknown function. DMR6  transcription is locally induced during infections with both compatible and  incompatible H. parasitica isolates. High DMR6 transcript levels were also  observed in constitutive defense mutants and after treatment with salicylic acid  analog BTH, suggesting that DMR6 has a role during plant defense. Expression  analysis of dmr6 mutants, using DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR, showed the  enhanced expression of a subset of defense-associated genes, including DMR6  itself, suggesting dmr6-mediated resistance results from the activation of plant  defense responses. Alternatively, resistance could be caused by the accumulation  of a toxic DMR6 substrate, or by the absence of a DMR6 metabolic product that is  required for H. parasitica infection.', '2008 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03427.x', 'Van']
