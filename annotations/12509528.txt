['12509528', 'Degradation of active C(19)-gibberellins (GAs) by dioxygenases through  2beta-hydroxylation yields inactive GA products. We identified two genes in  Arabidopsis (AtGA2ox7 and AtGA2ox8), using an activation-tagging mutant screen,  that encode 2beta-hydroxylases. GA levels in both activation-tagged lines were  reduced significantly, and the lines displayed dwarf phenotypes typical of  mutants with a GA deficiency. Increased expression of either AtGA2ox7 or AtGA2ox8  also caused a dwarf phenotype in tobacco, indicating that the substrates for  these enzymes are conserved. AtGA2ox7 and AtGA2ox8 are more similar to each other  than to other proteins encoded in the Arabidopsis genome, indicating that they  may constitute a separate class of GA-modifying enzymes. Indeed, enzymatic assays  demonstrated that AtGA2ox7 and AtGA2ox8 both perform the same GA modification:  2beta-hydroxylation of C(20)-GAs but not of C(19)-GAs. Lines containing increased  expression of AtGA2ox8 exhibited a GA dose-response curve for stem elongation  similar to that of the biosynthetic mutant ga1-11. Double loss-of-function  Atga2ox7 Atga2ox8 mutants had twofold to fourfold higher levels of active GAs and  displayed phenotypes associated with excess GAs, such as early bolting in short  days, resistance to the GA biosynthesis inhibitor ancymidol, and decreased mRNA  levels of AtGA20ox1, a gene in the GA biosynthetic pathway.', '2003 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.005975', 'Amasino']
