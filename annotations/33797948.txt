Sugarcane pokkah boeng disease (PBD) is emerging as a prevalent foliar disease in China. This airborne disease is caused by the <i>Fusarium</i> species complex. To investigate the diversity and evolution of <i>Fusarium</i> spp., we performed whole-genome sequencing of <i>Fusarium andiyazi</i> YN28 using a combination of Oxford Nanopore and Illumina technology. The <i>F. andiyazi</i> YN28 genome was sequenced, assembled, and annotated. A high-quality genome was assembled into 24 contigs with an N<sub>50</sub> of 2.80 Mb. The genome assembly generated a total size of 44.1 Mb with a GC content of 47.64%. In total, 15,508 genes were predicted, including 794 genes related to the carbohydrate-active enzymes, 397 noncoding RNA, 155 genes associated with transporter classification, 4,550 genes linked to pathogen-host interactions, and 269 genes involved in effector proteins. Collectively, our results will provide insight into the host-pathogen interactions and will facilitate the breeding of new varieties of sugarcane resistant to PBD.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
