Flowering transition is a crucial development process in cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L.), and the flowering time is closely correlated with the timing of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>) expression. However, the mechanism underlying the coordination of various <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements in the <i>FT</i> promoter of cotton has not been determined. In this study, a 5.9-kb promoter of <i>FT</i> was identified from cotton. A bioinformatics analysis showed that multiple insertion-deletion sites existed in the 5.9-kb promoter. Different expression levels of a reporter gene, and the induction by sequential deletions in <i>GhFT</i> promoter, demonstrated that 1.8-kb of the <i>GhFT</i> promoter was stronger than 4.2-, 4.8-, and 5.9-kb promoter fragments. The binding sites of the CONSTANS (CO) and NUCLEAR FACTOR Y transcription factors were located within the 1.0-kb sequence upstream of the <i>FT</i> transcription start site. A large number of repeat segments were identified in proximal promoter regions (-1.1 to -1.4 kb). A complementation analysis of deletion constructs between 1.0 and 1.8 kb of <i>G. hirsutum</i>, <i>Gossypium arboretum</i>, and <i>Gossypium raimondii</i> <i>FT</i> promoters revealed that the 1.0-kb fragment significantly rescued the late-flowering phenotype of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>FT</i> loss-of-function mutant <i>ft-10</i>, whereas the 1.8-kb promoter only slightly rescued the late-flowering phenotype. Furthermore, the conserved CORE motif in the cotton <i>FT</i> promoter is an atypical TGTG(N2-3)ATG, but the number of arbitrary bases between TGTG and ATG is uncertain. Thus, the proximal <i>FT</i> promoter region might play an important role affecting the activity levels of <i>FT</i> promoters in cotton flowering.
