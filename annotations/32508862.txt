Nitration of diverse biomolecules, including proteins, lipids and nucleic acid, by reactive nitrogen species represents one of the key mechanisms mediating nitric oxide (NO) biological activity across all types of organisms. 8-nitroguanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-nitro-cGMP) has been described as a unique electrophilic intermediate involved in intracellular redox signaling. In animal cells, 8-nitro-cGMP is formed from guanosine-5'-triphosphate by a combined action of reactive nitrogen (RNS) and oxygen species (ROS) and guanylate cyclase. As demonstrated originally in animal models, 8-nitro-cGMP shows certain biological activities closely resembling its analog cGMP; however, its regulatory functions are mediated mainly by its electrophilic properties and chemical interactions with protein thiols resulting in a novel protein post-translational modification termed S-guanylation. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, 8-nitro-cGMP was reported to mediate NO-dependent signaling pathways controlling abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure, however, its derivative 8-mercapto-cGMP (8-SH-cGMP) was later shown as the active component of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S)-mediated guard cell signaling. Here we present a survey of current knowledge on biosynthesis, metabolism and biological activities of nitrated nucleotides with special attention to described and proposed functions of 8-nitro-cGMP and its metabolites in plant physiology and stress responses.
