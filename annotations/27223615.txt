['27223615', 'The genome of the Synechococcus elongatus strain PCC 7942 encodes a putative  sugar kinase (SePSK), which shares 44.9% sequence identity with the xylulose  kinase-1 (AtXK-1) from Arabidopsis thaliana. Sequence alignment suggests that  both kinases belong to the ribulokinase-like carbohydrate kinases, a sub-family  of FGGY family carbohydrate kinases. However, their exact physiological function  and real substrates remain unknown. Here we solved the structures of SePSK and  AtXK-1 in both their apo forms and in complex with nucleotide substrates. The two  kinases exhibit nearly identical overall architecture, with both kinases  possessing ATP hydrolysis activity in the absence of substrates. In addition, our  enzymatic assays suggested that SePSK has the capability to phosphorylate  D-ribulose. In order to understand the catalytic mechanism of SePSK, we solved  the structure of SePSK in complex with D-ribulose and found two potential  substrate binding pockets in SePSK. Using mutation and activity analysis, we  further verified the key residues important for its catalytic activity. Moreover,  our structural comparison with other family members suggests that there are major  conformational changes in SePSK upon substrate binding, facilitating the  catalytic process. Together, these results provide important information for a  more detailed understanding of the cofactor and substrate binding mode as well as  the catalytic mechanism of SePSK, and possible similarities with its plant  homologue AtXK-1.', '2016', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0156067', 'Chang']
