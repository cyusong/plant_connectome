WRKYs are important regulators in plant development and stress responses. However, knowledge of this superfamily in soybean is limited. In this study, we characterized the drought- and salt-induced gene <i>GmWRKY12</i> based on RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR. <i>GmWRKY12</i>, which is 714 bp in length, encoded 237 amino acids and grouped into WRKY II. The promoter region of <i>GmWRKY12</i> included ABER4, MYB, MYC, GT-1, W-box and DPBF <i>cis</i>-elements, which possibly participate in abscisic acid (ABA), drought and salt stress responses. <i>GmWRKY12</i> was minimally expressed in different tissues under normal conditions but highly expressed under drought and salt treatments. As a nucleus protein, <i>GmWRKY12</i> was responsive to drought, salt, ABA and salicylic acid (SA) stresses. Using a transgenic hairy root assay, we further characterized the roles of <i>GmWRKY12</i> in abiotic stress tolerance. Compared with control (Williams 82), overexpression of <i>GmWRKY12</i> enhanced drought and salt tolerance, increased proline (Pro) content and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content under drought and salt treatment in transgenic soybean seedlings. These results may provide a basis to understand the functions of <i>GmWRKY12</i> in abiotic stress responses in soybean.
