Studies on MADS-box genes in Arabidopsis and other higher eudicotyledonous flowering plants have shown that they are key regulators of flower development. Since Arabidopsis and monocotyledonous rice are distantly related plant species it is interesting to investigate whether the floral organ identity factors have been conserved in their functions, and if not, to understand the differences. Arabidopsis and rice are very suitable for these studies since they are both regarded as models for plant functional genomics. Both their genomes are sequenced and tools are available for the analysis of gene function. These developments have accelerated experiments and increased our knowledge on rice gene function. Therefore it is the right moment to perform a comparative analysis on MADS-box factors controlling floral organ identity as reported in this review.
