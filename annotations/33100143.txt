Structural components of second messenger signaling (nucleotides and associated enzyme systems) within plant and animal cells have more in common than the hormones that initiate metabolic and functional changes. Neurotransmitters and hormones of mammalian pharmacologic classes relate to purine nucleotides in respect of chemical structure and the molecular changes they initiate. This study compares the molecular structures of purine nucleotides with compounds from the abscisic acid, auxin, brassinosteroid, cytokinin, gibberellin, and jasmonate classes by means of a computational program. The results illustrate how phytohomones relate to each other through the structures of nucleotides and cyclic nucleotides. Molecular similarity within the phytohormone structures relates to synergism, antagonism and the modulation of nucleotide function that regulates germination and plant development. As with the molecular evolution of mammalian hormones, cell signaling and cross-talk within the phytohormone classes is purine nucleotide centered.
