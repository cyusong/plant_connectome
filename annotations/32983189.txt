Nitrogen fertilization is common for poplar trees to improve growth and productivity. The utilization of N by poplar largely depends on fertilizer application patterns; however, the underlying regulatory hubs are not fully understood. In this study, N utilization and potentially physiological regulations of two poplar clones (XQH and BC5) were assessed through two related experiments (i: five levels of N supply and ii: conventional and exponential N additions). Poplar growth (leaf area) and N utilization significantly increased under fertilized compared to unfertilized conditions, whereas photosynthetic N utilization efficiency significantly decreased under low N supplies. Growth characteristics were better in the XQH than in the BC5 clone under the same N supplies, indicating higher N utilization efficiency. Leaf absorbed light energy, and thermal dissipation fraction was significantly different for XQH clone between conventional and exponential N additions. Leaf concentrations of putrescine (Put) and acetylated Put were significantly higher in exponential than in conventional N addition. Photorespiration significantly increased in leaves of XQH clone under exponential compared to conventional N addition. Our results indicate that an interaction of the clone and N supply pattern significantly occurs in poplar growth; leaf expansion and the storage N allocations are the central hubs in the regulation of poplar N utilization.
