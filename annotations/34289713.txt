The soilborne filamentous fungus <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> causes devastating diseases of many cultivated plant species. <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>raphani</i> and f. sp. <i>rapae</i> are two of four formae speciales that are pathogenic to Brassicaceae plants. Here, we present high-quality genome sequences of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>raphani</i> strain Tf1262 and <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>rapae</i> strain Tf1208 that were isolated from radish (<i>Raphanus sativus</i>) and turnip (<i>Brassica rapa</i> var. <i>rapa</i>), respectively. These genome resources should facilitate in-depth investigation of interactions between <i>F. oxysporum</i> and Brassicaceae plants, and enable comparative genomics of the <i>F. oxysporum</i> species complex to uncover how pathogenicity evolved within <i>F. oxysporum</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
