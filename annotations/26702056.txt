['26702056', 'The chloroplast is the site of photosynthesis and many other essential plant  metabolic processes, and chloroplast development is an integral part of plant  growth and development. Mutants defective in chloroplast development can display  various color phenotypes including the intriguing virescence phenotype, which  shows yellow/white coloration at the leaf base and greening toward the leaf tip.  Through large scale genetic screens, we identified a series of new virescent  mutants including virescent3-1 (vir3-1), vir4-1, and vir5-1 in Arabidopsis  thaliana. We showed that VIR3 encodes a putative chloroplast metalloprotease by  map-based cloning. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that the  conserved histidine 235 residue in the zinc binding motif HEAGH of VIR3 is  indispensable for VIR3 accumulation in the chloroplast. The chloroplast  localization of VIR3 was confirmed by the transient expression of VIR3-GFP in  leaf protoplasts. Furthermore, taking advantage of transgenic lines expressing  VIR3-FLAG, we demonstrated that VIR3 is an intrinsic thylakoid membrane protein  that mainly resides in the stromal lamellae. Moreover, topology analysis using  transgenic lines expressing a dual epitope-tagged VIR3 indicated that both the N  and C termini of VIR3 are located in the stroma, and the catalytic domain of VIR3  is probably facing the stroma. Blue native gel analysis indicated that VIR3 is  likely present as a monomer or part of a small complex in the thylakoid membrane.  This work not only implicates VIR3 as a new factor involved in early chloroplast  development but also provides more insight into the roles of chloroplast  proteases in chloroplast biogenesis.', '2016 Feb 12', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M115.681601', 'Yu']
