Plastoglobules (PGs) in chloroplasts are monolayer lipid-protein particles attached to thylakoids. The size and number of PGs per chloroplast respond dynamically to abiotic environmental stresses and developmental transitions. During senescence, the thylakoid membranes and its constituents are dismantled in controlled fashion. Leaf senescence coincides with a dramatic increase in the size of PGs, which is consistent with a functional role of PG in remobilization of thylakoid membrane components. In a recent publication, <sup>1</sup> we showed that PG-localized metallopeptidase PGM48 promotes natural senescence. In plants, PGM48 has homologs in mitochondria and the endomembrane system, but PGM48 evolved specifically in photosynthetic organisms. Extensive analysis of Arabidopsis transgenic lines either under- or overexpressing PGM48, showed that PGM48 is a positive regulator of senescence, and we proposed that PG-localized carotenoid cleavage enzyme 4 (CCD4) is a potential substrate of PGM48. Here, we discuss PGM48 function and how it may accelerate natural senescence.
