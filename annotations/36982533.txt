<i>Chilo suppressalis</i> is one of the most damaging rice pests in China's rice-growing regions. Chemical pesticides are the primary method for pest control; the excessive use of insecticides has resulted in pesticide resistance. <i>C. suppressalis</i> is highly susceptible to cyproflanilide, a novel pesticide with high efficacy. However, the acute toxicity and detoxification mechanisms remain unclear. We carried out a bioassay experiment with <i>C. suppressalis</i> larvae and found that the LD<sub>10</sub>, LD<sub>30</sub> and LD<sub>50</sub> of cyproflanilide for 3rd instar larvae was 1.7 ng/per larvae, 6.62 ng/per larvae and 16.92 ng/per larvae, respectively. Moreover, our field trial results showed that cyproflanilide had a 91.24% control efficiency against <i>C. suppressalis</i>. We investigated the effect of cyproflanilide (LD<sub>30</sub>) treatment on the transcriptome profiles of <i>C. suppressalis</i> larvae and found that 483 genes were up-regulated and 305 genes were down-regulated in response to cyproflanilide exposure, with significantly higher <i>CYP4G90</i> and <i>CYP4AU10</i> expression in the treatment group. The RNA interference knockdown of <i>CYP4G90</i> and <i>CYP4AU10</i> increased mortality by 20% and 18%, respectively, compared to the control. Our results indicate that cyproflanilide has effective insecticidal toxicological activity, and that the <i>CYP4G90</i> and <i>CYP4AU10</i> genes are involved in detoxification metabolism. These findings provide an insight into the toxicological basis of cyproflanilide and the means to develop efficient resistance management tools for <i>C. suppressalis</i>.
