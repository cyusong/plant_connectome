The 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs, which result from the 45S precursor, together with 5S rRNAs, are central components of the ribosome. The integration of one molecule of each rRNA per ribosome necessitates an elaborate coordination between transcriptions of the two ribosomal DNA (rDNA) families. Even though 5S rDNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III and 45S rDNA by RNA polymerase I, the two rDNA families present certain similarities in their transcriptional regulation. This review aims to compare 5S and 45S rRNA genes in the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana in terms of organization, transcription and regulation, and draws parallels between the two rDNA families.
