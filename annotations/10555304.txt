['10555304', "In plant cells, plastid DNA is transcribed by at least two types of RNA  polymerase, plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) and nuclear-encoded RNA  polymerase (NEP). PEP is homologous to eubacterial transcription machinery, but  its regulatory subunit, sigma (sigma) factor, is not encoded on the plastid DNA.  We previously cloned the three nuclear-encoded sigma factor genes from  Arabidopsis thaliana and designated them as sigA, sigB, and sigC. By means of  RFLP mapping, sigA and sigB were mapped on chromosome I and sigC on the  chromosome III. Based on comparison of the genomic structure of the three sig  genes, intron sites in the 3' half of the genes were shown to be identical  between sigB and sigC but divergent in sigA, consistent with the phylogenetic  relevance of the three gene products. A transient expression assay of GFP fusions  in Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that the N-termini of all three sig gene  products functioned as chloroplast-targeting signals. We also constructed  transgenic Arabidopsis lines harboring the sigA-promoter or the sigB-promoter  uidA fusion. Both the sigA- and sigB-promoters were similarly activated at  cotyledons, hypocotyls, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, sepals, and siliques but  not at roots, seeds, or other flower organs. In addition, the two promoters were  repeatedly activated in young seedlings under continuous light, possibly in an  oscillated fashion.", '1999 Aug', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029612', 'Takahashi']
