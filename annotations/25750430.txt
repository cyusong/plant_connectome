Successful sexual reproduction often relies on the ability of plants to recognize self- or genetically-related pollen and prevent pollen tube growth soon after germination in order to avoid self-fertilization. Angiosperms have developed different reproductive barriers, one of the most extended being self-incompatibility (SI). With SI, pistils are able to reject self or genetically-related pollen thus promoting genetic variability. There are basically two distinct systems of SI: gametophytic (GSI) and sporophytic (SSI) based on their different molecular and genetic control mechanisms. In both types of SI, programmed cell death (PCD) has been found to play an important role in the rejection of self-incompatible pollen. Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) were initially recognized as toxic metabolic products, in recent years, a new role for ROS has become apparent: the control and regulation of biological processes such as growth, development, response to biotic and abiotic environmental stimuli, and PCD. Together with ROS, nitric oxide (NO) has become recognized as a key regulator of PCD. PCD is an important mechanism for the controlled elimination of targeted cells in both animals and plants. The major focus of this review is to discuss how ROS and NO control male-female cross-talk during fertilization in order to trigger PCD in self-incompatible pollen, providing a highly effective way to prevent self-fertilization.

ROS: !regulates! PCD
NO: !regulates! PCD
PCD: !prevents! self-fertilization
ROS/NO: !control! male-female cross-talk
