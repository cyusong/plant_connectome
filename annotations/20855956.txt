The tomato FW2.2 quantitative trait locus, which regulates tomato fruit size, was genetically and physically mapped around 15 years ago. Subsequently, the FW2.2 gene was cloned and shown to contain a PLAC8 domain, originally identified in mammalian placental proteins. Data suggest that FW2.2 likely controls tomato cell size, perhaps by direct interaction with casein kinase II. Several FW2.2-like (FWL) genes have now been identified from a variety of plant species, but until recently only the tomato FW2.2 gene had been the subject of detailed investigation. Recently, soybean and maize FWL genes were identified and shown to have a role in plant organogenesis. It is now apparent that the FWL genes in plants are a large gene family, which is even larger given inclusion of genes for the various eukaryotic PLAC8-domain proteins. Although overall the protein sequence identity/similarity among the family members is relatively low, there is strong conservation of key domains, suggesting a conservation of the core biochemical function of these proteins. In this Addendum Article, we highlight the similarities and differences exiting between plant FWL genes and enlarge this comparison to the mammalian PLAC8 genes. These comparisons suggest the possible conservation of biological function for FWL proteins.
