['16514015', 'Eukaryotic E2Fs are conserved transcription factors playing crucial and  antagonistic roles in several pathways related to cell division, DNA repair, and  differentiation. In plants, these processes are strictly intermingled at the  growing zone to produce postembryonic development in response to internal signals  and environmental cues. Of the six AtE2F proteins found in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana), only AtE2Fa and AtE2Fb have been clearly indicated as  activators of E2F-responsive genes. AtE2Fa activity was shown to induce S phase  and endoreduplication, whereas the function of AtE2Fb and the interrelationship  between these two transcription factors was unclear. We have investigated the  role played by the AtE2Fb gene during cell cycle and development performing in  situ RNA hybridization, immunolocalization of the AtE2Fb protein in planta, and  analysis of AtE2Fb promoter activity in transgenic plants. Overexpression of  AtE2Fb in transgenic Arabidopsis plants led to striking modifications of the  morphology of roots, cotyledons, and leaves that can be ascribed to stimulation  of cell division. The accumulation of the AtE2Fb protein in these lines was  paralleled by an increased expression of E2F-responsive G1/S and G2/M marker  genes. These results suggest that AtE2Fa and AtE2Fb have specific expression  patterns and play similar but distinct roles during cell cycle progression.', '2006 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.077990', 'Cella']
