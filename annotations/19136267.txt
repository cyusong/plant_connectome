['19136267', 'Storage oil breakdown plays an important role in the life cycle of many plants by  providing the carbon skeletons that support seedling growth immediately following  germination. This metabolic process is initiated by lipases (EC: 3.1.1.3), which  catalyze the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) to release free fatty acids  and glycerol. A number of lipases have been purified to near homogeneity from  seed tissues and analysed for their in vitro activities. Furthermore, several  genes encoding lipases have been cloned and characterised from plants. However,  only recently has data been presented to establish the molecular identity of a  lipase that has been shown to be required for TAG breakdown in seeds. In this  review we briefly outline the processes of TAG synthesis and breakdown. We then  discuss some of the biochemical literature on seed lipases and describe the  cloning and characterisation of a lipase called SUGAR-DEPENDENT1, which is  required for TAG breakdown in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds.', '2009 Jun', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2008.12.005', 'Eastmond']
