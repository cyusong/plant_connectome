After recognizing a biotic stress, plants activate signalling pathways to fight against the attack. Typically, these signalling pathways involve the activation of phosphorylation cascades mediated by Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs). In the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>-<i>Tetranychus urticae</i> plant-herbivore model, several Arabidopsis MAP kinases are induced by the mite attack. In this study, we demonstrate the participation of the MEKK-like kinases MAPKKK17 and MAPKKK21. Leaf damage caused by the mite was assessed using T-DNA insertion lines. Differential levels of damage were found when the expression of <i>MAPKKK17</i> was increased or reduced. In contrast, reduced expression of <i>MAPKKK21</i> resulted in less damage caused by the mite. Whereas the expression of several genes associated with hormonal responses did not suffer significant variations in the T-DNA insertion lines, the expression of one of these kinases depends on the expression of the other one. In addition, <i>MAPKKK17</i> and <i>MAPKKK21</i> are coexpressed with different sets of genes and encode proteins with low similarity in the C-terminal region. Overall, our results demonstrate that MAPKKK17 and MAPKKK21 have opposite roles. MAPKKK17 and MAPKKK21 act as positive and negative regulators, respectively, on the plant response. The induction of <i>MAPKKK17</i> and <i>MAPKKK21</i> after mite infestation would be integrated into the bulk of signalling pathways activated to balance the response of the plant to a biotic stress.
