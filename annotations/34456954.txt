Photoperiod-regulated floral transition is vital to the flowering plant. <i>Luculia gratissima</i> "Xiangfei" is a flowering ornamental plant with high development potential economically and is a short-day woody perennial. However, the genetic regulation of short-day-induced floral transition in <i>L. gratissima</i> is unclear. To systematically research the responses of <i>L. gratissima</i> during this process, dynamic changes in morphology, physiology, and transcript levels were observed and identified in different developmental stages of long-day- and short-day-treated <i>L. gratissima</i> plants. We found that floral transition in <i>L. gratissima</i> occurred 10 d after short-day induction, but flower bud differentiation did not occur at any stage under long-day conditions. A total of 1,226 differentially expressed genes were identified, of which 146 genes were associated with flowering pathways of sugar, phytohormones, photoperiod, ambient temperature, and aging signals, as well as floral integrator and meristem identity genes. The trehalose-6-phosphate signal positively modulated floral transition by interacting with SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING-LIKE PROTEIN 4 (SPL4) in the aging pathway. Endogenous gibberellin, abscisic acid, cytokinin, and jasmonic acid promoted floral transition, whereas strigolactone inhibited it. In the photoperiod pathway, FD, CONSTANS-LIKE 12, and nuclear factors Y positively controlled floral transition, whereas PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7, FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT F-BOX PROTEIN 1, and LUX negatively regulated it. SPL4 and pEARLI1 positively affected floral transition. Suppressor of Overexpression of Constans 1 and AGAMOUSLIKE24 integrated multiple flowering signals to modulate the expression of <i>FRUITFULL</i>/<i>AGL8</i>, <i>AP1</i>, <i>LEAFY</i>, <i>SEPALLATAs</i>, <i>SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE</i>, and <i>TERMINAL FLOWER 1</i>, thereby regulating floral transition. Finally, we propose a regulatory network model for short-day-induced floral transition in <i>L. gratissima</i>. This study improves our understanding of flowering time regulation in <i>L. gratissima</i> and provides knowledge for its production and commercialization.
