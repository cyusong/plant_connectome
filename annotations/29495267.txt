['29495267', 'Agrobacterium tumefaciens can genetically transform various eukaryotic cells  because of the presence of a resident tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid. During  infection, a defined region of the Ti plasmid, transfer DNA (T-DNA), is  transferred from bacteria into plant cells and causes plant cells to abnormally  synthesize auxin and cytokinin, which results in crown gall disease. T-DNA and  several virulence (Vir) proteins are secreted through a type IV secretion system  (T4SS) composed of T-pilus and a transmembrane protein complex. Three members of  Arabidopsis reticulon-like B (RTNLB) proteins, RTNLB1, 2, and 4, interact with  VirB2, the major component of T-pilus. Here, we have identified that other RTNLB  proteins, RTNLB3 and 8, interact with VirB2 in vitro. Root-based A. tumefaciens  transformation assays with Arabidopsis rtnlb3, or rtnlb5-10 single mutants showed  that the rtnlb8 mutant was resistant to A. tumefaciens infection. In addition,  rtnlb3 and rtnlb8 mutants showed reduced transient transformation efficiency in  seedlings. RTNLB3- or 8 overexpression transgenic plants showed increased  susceptibility to A. tumefaciens and Pseudomonas syringae infection. RTNLB1-4 and  8 transcript levels differed in roots, rosette leaves, cauline leaves,  inflorescence, flowers, and siliques of wild-type plants. Taken together, RTNLB3  and 8 may participate in A. tumefaciens infection but may have different roles in  plants.', '2018 Feb 24', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms19020638', 'ORCID:']
