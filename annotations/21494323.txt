['21494323', 'Cyanate is toxic to all organisms. Cyanase converts cyanate to CO(2) and NH(3) in a  bicarbonate-dependent reaction. The biophysical functions and biochemical  characteristics of plant cyanases are poorly studied, although it has been  investigated in a variety of proteobacteria, cyanobacteria and fungi. In this  study, we characterised plant cyanases from Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa  (AtCYN and OsCYN). Prokaryotic-expressed AtCYN and OsCYN both showed cyanase  activity in vitro. Temperature had a similar influence on the activity of both  cyanases, but pH had a differential impact on AtCYN and OsCYN activity. Homology  modelling provided models of monomers of AtCYN and OsCYN, and a  coimmunoprecipitation assay and gel filtration indicated that AtCYN and OsCYN  formed homodecamers. The analysis of single-residue mutants of AtCYN indicated  that the conserved catalytic residues also contributed to the stability of the  homodecamer. KCNO treatment inhibited Arabidopsis germination and early seedling  growth. Plants containing AtCYN or OsCYN exhibited resistance to KCNO stress,  which demonstrated that one role of cyanases in plants is detoxification.  Transcription level of AtCYN was higher in the flower than in other organs of  Arabidopsis. AtCYN transcription was not significantly affected by KCNO treatment  in Arabidopsis, but was induced by salt stress. This research broadens our  knowledge on plant detoxification of cyanate via cyanase.', '2011 Mar 31', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0018300', 'Li']
