Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant hormones that play an essential role in plant development and have the ability to protect plants against various environmental stresses, such as low and high temperature, drought, heat, salinity, heavy metal toxicity, and pesticides. Mitigation of stress effects are produced through independent mechanisms or by interaction with other important phytohormones. However, there are few studies in which this property has been reported for BRs analogs. Thus, in this work, the enhancement of drought stress tolerance of <i>A. thaliana</i> was assessed for a series of 2-deoxybrassinosteroid analogs. In addition, the growth-promoting activity in the Rice Lamina Inclination Test (RLIT) was also evaluated. The results show that analog 1 exhibits similar growth activity as brassinolide (BL; used as positive control) in the RLIT bioassay. Interestingly, both compounds increase their activities by a factor of 1.2-1.5 when they are incorporated to polymer micelles formed by Pluronic F-127. On the other hand, tolerance to water deficit stress of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> seedlings was evaluated by determining survival rate and dry weight of seedlings after the recovery period. In both cases, the effect of analog 1 is higher than that exhibited by BL. Additionally, the expression of a subset of drought stress marker genes was evaluated in presence and absence of exogenous applied BRs. Results obtained by qRT-PCR analysis, indicate that transcriptional changes of At<i>DREBD2</i>A and <i>AtNCED3</i> genes were more significant in <i>A. thaliana</i> treated with analog 1 in homogeneous solution than in that treated with BL. These changes suggest the activation of alternative pathway in response to water stress deficit. Thus, exogenous application of BRs synthetic analogs could be a potential tool for improvement of crop production under stress conditions.
