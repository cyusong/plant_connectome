Abscisic acid (ABA) glucose conjugation mediated by uridine diphosphate glucosyltransferases (UGTs) is an important pathway in regulating ABA homeostasis. In the present study, we investigated three tomato SlUGTs that are highly expressed in fruit during ripening, and these SlUGTs were localized to the cytoplasm and cell nucleus. Among these three UGTs, SlUGT75C1 catalyzes the glucosylation of both ABA and IAA in vitro; SlUGT76E1 can only catalyze the conjugation of ABA; and SlUGT73C4 cannot glycosylate either ABA or IAA. Therefore, SlUGT75C1 was selected for further investigation. SlUGT75C1 RNA interference significantly up-regulated the expression level of SlCYP707A2, which encodes an ABA 8'-hydroxylase but did not affect the expression of SlNCED1, which encodes a key enzyme in ABA biosynthesis. Suppression of SlUGT75C1 significantly accelerated fruit ripening by enhancing ABA levels and promoting the early release of ethylene. SlUGT75C1-RNAi altered the expression of fruit ripening genes (genes involved in ethylene release and cell wall catabolism). SlUGT75C1-RNAi seeds showed delayed germination and root growth compared with wild-type as well as increased sensitivity to exogenous ABA. SlUGT75C1-RNAi plants were also more resistant to drought stress. These results demonstrated that SlUGT75C1 plays a crucial role in ABA-mediated fruit ripening, seed germination, and drought responses in tomato.
