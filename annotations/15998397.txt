Quantitative assessment of carbon (C) storage by forests requires an understanding of climatic controls over respiratory C loss. Ecosystem respiration can be estimated biometrically as the sum (R Sigma) of soil (Rs), leaf (Rl) and wood (Rw) respiration, and meteorologically by measuring above-canopy nocturnal CO2 fluxes (Fcn). Here we estimated R Sigma over 5 yr in a forest in Michigan, USA, and compared R Sigma and Fcn on turbulent nights. We also evaluated forest carbon-use efficiency (Ec = P(NP)/P(GP)) using biometric estimates of net primary production (P(NP)) and R Sigma and Fcn-derived estimates of gross primary production (P(GP)). Interannual variation in R Sigma was modest (142 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Mean annual R Sigma was 1425 g C m(-2) yr(-1); 71% from Rs, 18% from Rl, and 11% from Rw. Hourly R Sigma was well correlated with Fcn, but 11 to 58% greater depending on the time of year. Greater R Sigma compared with Fcn resulted in higher estimated annual P(GP) and lower annual Ec (0.42 vs 0.54) using biometric and meteorological data, respectively. Our results provide one of the first multiyear estimates of R Sigma in a forested ecosystem, and document the responses of component respiratory C losses to major climatic drivers. They also provide the first assessment of Ec in a deciduous forest using independent estimates of P(GP).
