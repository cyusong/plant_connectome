Accumulation of unfolded protein or misfolded protein causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Increased salt concentration activates a stress response pathway in the ER in Arabidopsis thaliana to induce the expression of several salt stress response genes, leading to a more optimal protein folding environment in the ER. In addition, some salt stress-regulated proteins require zinc for their activity, including some zinc-dependent DNA binding proteins and zinc-finger proteins. In a recent study, we reported that ZTP29, a putative zinc transporter at the ER membrane, is involved in the response to salt stress through regulation of zinc level in the ER to induce the UPR pathway. In this addendum, we propose a testable hypothesis for the role of ZTP29 in the response to salt stress via the regulation of zinc levels in the ER.

ZTP29: !regulates! zinc levels in ER 
zinc: !required for! activity of salt stress-regulated proteins 
ER stress: !induces! expression of salt stress response genes
