['21512130', 'Multiple steps of plant growth and development rely on rapid cell elongation  during which secretory and endocytic trafficking via the trans-Golgi network  (TGN) plays a central role. Here, we identify the ECHIDNA (ECH) protein from  Arabidopsis thaliana as a TGN-localized component crucial for TGN function. ECH  partially complements loss of budding yeast TVP23 function and a Populus ECH  complements the Arabidopsis ech mutant, suggesting functional conservation of the  genes. Compared with wild-type, the Arabidopsis ech mutant exhibits severely  perturbed cell elongation as well as defects in TGN structure and function,  manifested by the reduced association between Golgi bodies and TGN as well as  mislocalization of several TGN-localized proteins including vacuolar H(+)-ATPase  subunit a1 (VHA-a1). Strikingly, ech is defective in secretory trafficking,  whereas endocytosis appears unaffected in the mutant. Some aspects of the ech  mutant phenotype can be phenocopied by treatment with a specific inhibitor of  vacuolar H(+)-ATPases, concanamycin A, indicating that mislocalization of VHA-a1  may account for part of the defects in ech. Hence, ECH is an evolutionarily  conserved component of the TGN with a central role in TGN structure and function.', '2011 May 10', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1018371108', 'Bhalerao']
