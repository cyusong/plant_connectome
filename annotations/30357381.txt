Global food security depends on three main cereal crops (wheat, rice and maize) achieving and maintaining high yields, as well as increasing their future yields. Fundamental to the production of this biomass is photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis involves a large number of proteins that together account for the majority of the nitrogen in leaves. As large amounts of nitrogen are removed in the harvested grain, this needs to be replaced either from synthetic fertilizer or biological nitrogen fixation. Knowledge about photosynthetic properties of leaves in natural ecosystems is also important, particularly when we consider the potential impacts of climate change. While the relationship between nitrogen and photosynthetic capacity of a leaf differs between species, leaf nitrogen content provides a useful way to incorporate photosynthesis into models of ecosystems and the terrestrial biosphere. This review provides a generalized nitrogen budget for a C3 leaf cell and discusses the potential for improving photosynthesis from a nitrogen perspective.
