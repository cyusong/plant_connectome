Citrus leprosis (CiL) is one of the destructive emerging viral diseases of citrus in the Americas. Leprosis syndrome is associated with two taxonomically distinct groups of <i>Brevipalpus</i>-transmitted viruses (BTVs), that consist of positive-sense <i>Cilevirus</i>, <i>Higrevirus</i>, and negative-sense <i>Dichorhavirus</i>. The localized CiL symptoms observed in multiple citrus species and other alternate hosts indicates that these viruses might have originated from the mites and eventually adopted citrus as a secondary host. Genetic diversity in the genomes of viruses associated with the CiL disease complex have complicated current detection and diagnostic measures that prompted the application of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) protocols for improved detection and diagnosis. Two cileviruses are known to infect citrus, and among them only citrus leprosis virus C2 (CiLV-C2) hibiscus strain (CiLV-C2H) has been reported in hibiscus and passion fruit in the US. Based on our current CiL disease complex hypothesis, there is a high probability that CiL disease is associated with more viruses/strains that have not yet been identified but exist in nature. To protect the citrus industry, a Ribo-Zero HTS protocol was utilized for detection of cileviruses infecting three different hosts: <i>Citrus</i> spp., <i>Swinglea glutinosa</i>, and <i>Hibiscus rosa-sinensis.</i> Real-time RT-PCR assays were used to identify plants infected with CiLV-C2 or CiLV-C2H or both in mixed infection in all the above-mentioned plant genera. These results were further confirmed by bioinformatic analysis using HTS generated data. In this study, we utilized HTS assay in confirmatory diagnostics to screen BTVs infecting <i>Dieffenbachia</i> sp. (family: Araceae), <i>Passiflora edulis</i> (Passifloraceae), and <i>Smilax auriculata</i> (Smilacaceae). Through the implementation of HTS and downstream data analysis, we detected not only the known cileviruses in the studied hosts but also discovered a new strain of CiLV-C2 in hibiscus from Colombia. Phylogenetically, the new hibiscus strain is more closely related to CiLV-C2 than the known hibiscus strain, CiLV-C2H. We propose this strain to be named as CiLV-C2 hibiscus strain 2 (CiLV-C2H2). The findings from the study are critical for citrus growers, industry, regulators, and researchers. The possible movement of CiLV-C2H2 from hibiscus to citrus by the <i>Brevipalpus</i> spp. warrants further investigation.
