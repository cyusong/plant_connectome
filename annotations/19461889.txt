['19461889', 'Though central to our understanding of how roots perform their vital function of  scavenging water and solutes from the soil, no direct genetic evidence currently  exists to support the foundational model that suberin acts to form a chemical  barrier limiting the extracellular, or apoplastic, transport of water and solutes  in plant roots. Using the newly characterized enhanced suberin1 (esb1) mutant, we  established a connection in Arabidopsis thaliana between suberin in the root and  both water movement through the plant and solute accumulation in the shoot. Esb1  mutants, characterized by increased root suberin, were found to have reduced day  time transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during their  vegetative growth period. Furthermore, these changes in suberin and water  transport were associated with decreases in the accumulation of Ca, Mn, and Zn  and increases in the accumulation of Na, S, K, As, Se, and Mo in the shoot. Here,  we present direct genetic evidence establishing that suberin in the roots plays a  critical role in controlling both water and mineral ion uptake and transport to  the leaves. The changes observed in the elemental accumulation in leaves are also  interpreted as evidence that a significant component of the radial root transport  of Ca, Mn, and Zn occurs in the apoplast.', '2009 May', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1000492', 'Salt']
