['26258305', 'The plant hormone jasmonate plays crucial roles in regulating plant responses to  herbivorous insects and microbial pathogens and is an important regulator of  plant growth and development. Key mediators of jasmonate signalling include MYC  transcription factors, which are repressed by jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ)  transcriptional repressors in the resting state. In the presence of active  jasmonate, JAZ proteins function as jasmonate co-receptors by forming a  hormone-dependent complex with COI1, the F-box subunit of an SCF-type ubiquitin  E3 ligase. The hormone-dependent formation of the COI1-JAZ co-receptor complex  leads to ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of JAZ repressors  and release of MYC proteins from transcriptional repression. The mechanism by  which JAZ proteins repress MYC transcription factors and how JAZ proteins switch  between the repressor function in the absence of hormone and the co-receptor  function in the presence of hormone remain enigmatic. Here we show that  Arabidopsis MYC3 undergoes pronounced conformational changes when bound to the  conserved Jas motif of the JAZ9 repressor. The Jas motif, previously shown to  bind to hormone as a partly unwound helix, forms a complete alpha-helix that  displaces the amino (N)-terminal helix of MYC3 and becomes an integral part of  the MYC N-terminal fold. In this position, the Jas helix competitively inhibits  MYC3 interaction with the MED25 subunit of the transcriptional Mediator complex.  Our structural and functional studies elucidate a dynamic molecular switch  mechanism that governs the repression and activation of a major plant hormone  pathway.', '2015 Sep 10', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature14661', 'He']
