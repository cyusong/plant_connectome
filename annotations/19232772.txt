Momilactone A and B have been found only in rice and the moss, Hypnum plumaeforme, although both plants are taxonomically quite distinct. The endogenous concentrations of momilactone A and B in H. plumaeforme were 58.7 and 24.3 microg/g dry weight, respectively. UV-irradiation increased the concentrations of momilactone A and B. The concentrations of momilactone A and B, respectively, became 14- and 15-fold greater than those of non-UV-irradiated control. CuCl2 and FeCl2 (1 mmol/L) treatments also increased momilactone A and B concentrations by 2.7- to 6.1-fold and 2.9- to 6.3-fold, respectively. In addition, the protein phosphatase inhibitor, cantharidin, and jasmonic acid increased momilactone A and B concentrations in H. plumaeforme. Cantharidin acts as an elicitor and jasmonic acid is an important signaling molecule regulating inducible defense genes against the pathogen infection. Momilactone A and B, respectively, were increased 12- and 11-fold by 200 micromol/L cantharidin, and 14- and 15-fold by 100 micromol/L jasmonic acid compared with non-treated controls. As momilactone A and B are phytoalexins, these compounds may play an important role in defense responses against biotic and abiotic stress conditions in H. plumaeforme.
