Lateral root development is known to be regulated by Aux/IAA-ARF modules in <i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>. As components, several Aux/IAAs have participated in these Aux/IAA-ARF modules. In this study, to identify the biological function of IAA15 in plant developments, transgenic plant overexpressing the gain-of-function mutant of IAA15 (IAA15<sup>P75S</sup> OX) under the control of dexamethasone (DEX) inducible promoter, in which IAA15 protein was mutated by changing Pro-75 residue to Ser at the degron motif in conserved domain II, was constructed. As a result, we found that IAA15<sup>P75S</sup> OX plants show a decreased number of lateral roots. Coincidently, <i>IAA15</i> promoter-GUS reporter analysis revealed that <i>IAA15</i> transcripts were highly detected in all stages of developing lateral root tissues. It was also verified that the IAA15<sup>P75S</sup> protein is strongly stabilized against proteasome-mediated protein degradation by inhibiting its poly-ubiquitination, resulting in the transcriptional repression of auxin-responsive genes. In particular, transcript levels of <i>LBD16</i> and <i>LBD29</i>, which are positive regulators of lateral root formation, dramatically repressed in IAA15<sup>P75S</sup> OX plants. Furthermore, it was elucidated that IAA15 interacts with ARF7 and ARF19 and binds to the promoters of <i>LBD16</i> and <i>LBD29</i>, strongly suggesting that IAA15 represses lateral root formation through the transcriptional suppression of <i>LBD16</i> and <i>LBD29</i> by inhibiting ARF7 and ARF19 activity. Taken together, this study suggests that IAA15 also plays a key negative role in lateral root formation as a component of Aux/IAA-ARF modules.
