Polyploidization is an evolutionary event leading to structural changes of the genome(s), particularly allopolyploidization, which combines different genomes of distinct species. The tetraploid species, <i>Sorghum halepense</i>, is assumed an allopolyploid species formed by hybridization between diploid <i>S. bicolor</i> and <i>S. propinquum</i>. The repeat profiles of <i>S. bicolor</i>, <i>S. halepense</i>, and their relatives were compared to elucidate the repeats' role in shaping their genomes. The repeat frequencies and profiles of the three diploid accessions (<i>S. bicolor</i>, <i>S. bicolor</i> ssp. <i>verticilliflorum</i>, and <i>S. bicolor</i> var. <i>technicum</i>) and two tetraploid accessions (<i>S. halepense</i>) are similar. However, the polymorphic distribution of the subtelomeric satellites preferentially enriched in the tetraploid <i>S. halepense</i> indicates drastic genome rearrangements after the allopolyploidization event. Verified by CENH3 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing and fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) analysis the centromeres of <i>S. bicolor</i> are mainly composed of the abundant satellite SorSat137 (CEN38) and diverse CRMs, Athila of Ty3_gypsy and Ty1_copia-SIRE long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements. A similar centromere composition was found in <i>S. halepense</i>. The potential contribution of <i>S. bicolor</i> in the formation of tetraploid <i>S. halepense</i> is discussed.
