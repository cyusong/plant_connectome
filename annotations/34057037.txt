IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER 1 (IRT1) is a central iron transporter responsible for the uptake of iron from the rhizosphere to root epidermal cells. This study uses immunohistochemistry, histochemistry, and fluorometry to show that this gene's promoter is also active in the aboveground parts, specifically in phloem companied cells. Promoter activity here was regulated by iron as it was in the roots. The promoter of the close <i>IRT2</i> homolog was root-specific and only weakly active in the stem pits. RT-PCR showed the presence of a long splicing form exclusively in iron-deficient roots. The short splicing form was present in all organs regardless of the presence of iron. Immunohistology exhibited labeling on the periphery of the epidermal cells in matured root zone and intracellular patches in the meristematic cells. In the aboveground organs, the protein was seen in the whole volume of companion cells and in neighboring sieve elements as bodies. The fluorescent protein technique revealed the short IRT1 form to be present in the patches accumulated mainly around the nucleus and the long form as a continuous layer along the cells periphery. These results suggest that IRT1 has a role also in the aboveground organs.
