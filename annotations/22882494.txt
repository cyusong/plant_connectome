['22882494', 'Plants produce structurally diverse triterpenoids, which are important for their  life and survival. Most triterpenoids and sterols share a common biosynthetic  intermediate, 2,3-oxidosqualene (OS), which is cyclized by 2,3-oxidosqualene  cyclase (OSC). To investigate the role of an OSC, marneral synthase 1 (MRN1), in  planta, we characterized a Arabidopsis mrn1 knock-out mutant displaying  round-shaped leaves, late flowering, and delayed embryogenesis. Reduced growth of  mrn1 was caused by inhibition of cell expansion and elongation. Marnerol, a  reduced form of marneral, was detected in Arabidopsis overexpressing MRN1, but  not in the wild type or mrn1. Alterations in the levels of sterols and  triterpenols and defects in membrane integrity and permeability were observed in  the mrn1. In addition, GUS expression, under the control of the MRN1 gene  promoter, was specifically detected in shoot and root apical meristems, which are  responsible for primary growth, and the mRNA expression of Arabidopsis clade II  OSCs was preferentially observed in roots and siliques containing developing  seeds. The eGFP:MRN1 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in tobacco  protoplasts. Taken together, this report provides evidence that the unusual  triterpenoid pathway via marneral synthase is important for the growth and  development of Arabidopsis.', '2012 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05120.x', 'Suh']
