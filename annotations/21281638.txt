['21281638', 'We here identify the PPR protein MEF14 of the DYW subclass as a specific  trans-factor required for C to U editing of site matR-1895 by genetic mapping of  an EMS induced editing mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana. The wild type Col MEF14  gene complements mutant protoplasts. A T-DNA insertion in the MEF14 gene  abolishes detectable editing at the matR-1895 site. Lack of RNA editing at the  matR-1895 site does not alter the level of mature and precursor nad1 mRNA  molecules. Such RNA editing mutants can be used to analyse the function of genes  like this maturase related reading frame in plant mitochondria.', '2011 Feb 18', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2011.01.037', 'Takenaka']
