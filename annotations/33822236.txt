Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) and members of the SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROMEA-105 (SPA) protein family form an E3 ubiquitin ligase that suppresses light signaling in darkness by polyubiquitinating positive regulators of the light response. COP1/SPA is inactivated by light to allow photomorphogenesis to proceed. Mechanisms of inactivation include light-induced degradation of SPA1 and, in particular, SPA2, corresponding to a particularly efficient inactivation of COP1/SPA2 by light. Here, we show that SPA3 and SPA4 proteins are stable in the light, indicating that light-induced destabilization is specific to SPA1 and SPA2, possibly related to the predominant function of SPA1 and SPA2 in dark-grown etiolating seedlings. SPA2 degradation involves cullin and the COP10-DEETIOLATED-DAMAGED-DNA BINDING PROTEIN (DDB1) CDD complex, besides COP1. Consistent with this finding, light-induced SPA2 degradation required the DDB1-interacting Trp-Asp (WD)-repeat domain of SPA2. Deletion of the N-terminus of SPA2 containing the kinase domain led to strong stabilization of SPA2 in darkness and fully abolished light-induced degradation of SPA2. This prevented seedling de-etiolation even in very strong far-red and blue light and reduced de-etiolation in red light, indicating destabilization of SPA2 through its N-terminal domain is essential for light response. SPA2 is exclusively destabilized by phytochrome A in far-red and blue light. However, deletion of the N-terminal domain of SPA2 did not abolish SPA2-phytochrome A interaction in yeast nor in vivo. Our domain mapping suggests there are two SPA2-phytochrome A interacting domains, the N-terminal domain and the WD-repeat domain. Conferring a light-induced SPA2-phyA interaction only via the WD-repeat domain may thus not lead to COP1/SPA2 inactivation.
