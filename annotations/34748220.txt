The commonly observed negative relationship between stomatal density (SD) and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has led to SD being proposed as an indicator of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The use of SD as a proxy for CO<sub>2</sub> , however, has been hampered by an insufficient understanding of the intraspecific variation of this trait. We hypothesized that SD in Pinus sylvestris, a widely distributed conifer, varies geographically and that this variation is determined by major climatic variables. By sampling needles from naturally growing trees along a latitudinal range of 32.25°, equivalent to 13.7°C gradient of mean annual temperature (MAT) across Europe, we found that SD decreased from the warmest southern sites to the coldest sites in the north at a rate of 4 stomata per mm<sup>2</sup> for each 1°C, with MAT explaining 44% of the variation. Additionally, samples from a provenance trial exhibited a positive relationship between SD and the MAT of the original localities, suggesting that high SD is an adaptation to warm temperature. Our study revealed one of the strongest intraspecific relationships between SD and climate in any woody species, supporting the utility of SD as a temperature, rather than direct CO<sub>2</sub> , proxy. In addition, our results predict the response of SD to climate warming.
