Bananas are an important staple food crop in tropical and subtropical regions in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Central and South America. The plant is affected by numerous diseases, with the fungal leaf disease black Sigatoka, caused by <i>Mycosphaerella fijiensis</i> Morelet [anamorph: <i>Pseudocercospora fijiensis</i> (Morelet) Deighton], considered one of the most economically important phytosanitary problem. Although the development of resistant cultivars is recognized as most effective method for long term control of the disease, the majority of today's cultivars are susceptible. In order to gain insights into this pathosystem, this first systematic literature review on the topic is presented. Utilizing six databases (PubMed Central, Web of Science, Google Academic, Springer, CAPES and Scopus Journals) searches were performed using pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. From a total of 3,070 published studies examined, 24 were relevant with regard to the <i>Musa-P. fijiensis</i> pathosystem. Relevant papers highlighted that resistant and susceptible cultivars clearly respond differently to infection by this pathogen. <i>M. acuminata</i> wild diploids such as Calcutta 4 and other diploid cultivars can harbor sources of resistance genes, serving as parentals for the generation of improved diploids and subsequent gene introgression in new cultivars. From the sequenced reference genome of <i>Musa acuminata</i>, although the function of many genes in the genome still require validation, on the basis of transcriptome, proteome and biochemical data, numerous candidate genes and molecules have been identified for further evaluation through genetic transformation and gene editing approaches. Genes identified in the resistance response have included those associated with jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling, transcription factors, phenylpropanoid pathways, antioxidants and pathogenesis-related proteins. Papers in this study also revealed gene-derived markers in <i>Musa</i> applicable for downstream application in marker assisted selection. The information gathered in this review furthers understanding of the immune response in <i>Musa</i> to the pathogen <i>P. fijiensis</i> and is relevant for genetic improvement programs for bananas and plantains for control of black Sigatoka.
