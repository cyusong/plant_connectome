['16698945', 'The process of microtubule nucleation in plant cells is still a major question in  plant cell biology. gamma-Tubulin is known as one of the key molecular players  for microtubule nucleation in animal and fungal cells. Here, we provide genetic  evidence that in Arabidopsis thaliana, gamma-tubulin is required for the  formation of spindle, phragmoplast, and cortical microtubule arrays. We used a  reverse genetics approach to investigate the role of the two Arabidopsis  gamma-tubulin genes in plant development and in the formation of microtubule  arrays. Isolation of mutants in each gene and analysis of two combinations of  gamma-tubulin double mutants showed that the two genes have redundant functions.  The first combination is lethal at the gametophytic stage. Disruption of both  gamma-tubulin genes causes aberrant spindle and phragmoplast structures and  alters nuclear division in gametophytes. The second combination of gamma-tubulin  alleles affects late seedling development, ultimately leading to lethality 3  weeks after germination. This partially viable mutant combination enabled us to  follow dynamically the effects of gamma-tubulin depletion on microtubule arrays  in dividing cells using a green fluorescent protein marker. These results  establish the central role of gamma-tubulin in the formation and organization of  microtubule arrays in Arabidopsis.', '2006 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.039644', 'Bouchez']
