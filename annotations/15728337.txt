Exposing Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants to low temperature results in rapid induction of CBF1, 2, and 3 (CBF1-3; also known as DREB1B, C, and A, respectively), which encode transcriptional activators that induce expression of a battery of genes that increase plant freezing and chilling tolerance. Recently, it has been shown that basal levels of CBF3 transcripts and those of certain CBF-regulated genes exhibit circadian cycling. Here, we further explored the regulation of CBF1-3 by the circadian clock. The results indicated that the extent to which CBF1-3 transcripts accumulated in response to low temperature was dependent on the time of day that the plants were exposed to low temperature and that this was regulated by the circadian clock. The highest and lowest levels of cold-induced CBF1-3 transcript accumulation occurred at 4 and 16 h after subjective dawn, respectively. An analysis of CBF2 promoter-reporter gene fusions indicated that this control included transcriptional regulation. In addition, the cold responsiveness of RAV1 and ZAT12, genes that are cold induced in parallel with CBF1-3, was also subject to circadian regulation. However, whereas the maximum level of cold-induced RAV1 transcript accumulation occurred at the same time of day as did CBF1-3 transcripts, that of ZAT12 was in reverse phase, i.e. the highest level of cold-induced ZAT12 transcript accumulation occurred 16 h after subjective dawn. These results indicate that cold-induced expression of CBF1-3, RAV1, and ZAT12 is gated by the circadian clock and suggest that this regulation likely occurs through at least two nonidentical (though potentially overlapping) signaling pathways.
