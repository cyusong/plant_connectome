Cells sense a variety of extracellular signals balancing their metabolism and physiology according to changing growth conditions. Plasma membranes are the outermost informational barriers that render cells sensitive to regulatory inputs. Membranes are composed of different types of lipids that play not only structural but also informational roles. Hormones and other regulators are sensed by specific receptors leading to the activation of lipid metabolizing enzymes. These enzymes generate lipid second messengers. Among them, phosphatidic acid (PA) is a well-known intracellular messenger that regulates various cellular processes. This lipid affects the functional properties of cell membranes and binds to specific target proteins leading to either genomic (affecting transcriptome) or non-genomic responses. The subsequent biochemical, cellular and physiological reactions regulate plant growth, development and stress tolerance. In the present review, we focus on primary (genome-independent) signaling events triggered by rapid PA accumulation in plant cells and describe the functional role of PA in mediating response to hormones and hormone-like regulators. The contributions of individual lipid signaling enzymes to the formation of PA by specific stimuli are also discussed. We provide an overview of the current state of knowledge and future perspectives needed to decipher the mode of action of PA in the regulation of cell functions.
