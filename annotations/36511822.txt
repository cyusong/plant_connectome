Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are a plant-specific family of extracellular proteoglycans characterized by large and complex galactose-rich polysaccharide chains. Functional elucidation of AGPs, however, has been hindered by the high degree of redundancy of AGP genes. To uncover as yet unexplored roles of AGPs in Arabidopsis, a mutant of Hyp O-galactosyltransferase (HPGT), a critical enzyme that catalyzes the common initial step of Hyp-linked arabinogalactan chain biosynthesis, was used. Here we show, using the hpgt1,2,3 triple mutant, that a reduction in functional AGPs leads to a stomatal patterning defect in which two or more stomata are clustered together. This defect is attributed to increased and dysregulated symplastic transport following changes in plasmodesmata structure, such that highly permeable complex branched plasmodesmata with cavities in branching parts increased in the mutant. We also found that the hpgt1,2,3 mutation causes a reduction of cellulose in the cell wall and accumulation of pectin, which controls cell wall porosity. Our results highlight the importance of AGPs in the correct biogenesis of plasmodesmata, possibly acting through the regulation of cell wall properties surrounding the plasmodesmata.
