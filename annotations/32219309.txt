Plant hydraulic traits are essential metrics for characterizing variation in plant function, but they vary markedly with plant size and position in a plant. We explore the potential effect of conduit widening on variation in hydraulic traits along the stem. We examined three species that differ in conduit diameter at the stem base for a given height (Moringa oleifera, Casimiroa edulis, and Pinus ayacahuite). We made anatomical and hydraulic measurements at different distances from the stem tip, constructed vulnerability curves, and examined the safety-efficiency trade-off with height-standardized data. Our results showed that segment-specific hydraulic resistance varied predictably along the stem, paralleling changes in mean conduit diameter and total number of conduits. The Huber value and leaf specific conductivity also varied depending on the sampling point. Vulnerability curves were markedly less noisy with height standardization, making the vulnerability-efficiency trade-off clearer. Because conduits widen predictably along the stem, taking height and distance from the tip into account provides a way of enhancing comparability and interpretation of hydraulic traits. Our results suggest the need for rethinking hydraulic sampling for comparing plant functional differences and strategies across individuals.
