Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AMs) are divided into two types according to morphology: Arum- and Paris-type AMs. Gibberellins (GAs) mainly inhibit the establishment of Arum-type AM symbiosis in most model plants, whereas the effects of GAs on Paris-type AM symbiosis are unclear. To provide insight into the mechanism underlying this type of symbiosis, the roles of GAs were investigated in Eustoma grandiflorum when used as the host plant for Paris-type AM establishment. Eustoma grandiflorum seedlings were inoculated with the model AM fungus, Rhizophagus irregularis, and the effects of GA and the GA biosynthesis inhibitor uniconazole-P on the symbiosis were quantitatively evaluated. Exogenous GA significantly increased hyphopodium formation at the epidermis, thus leading to the promotion of fungal colonization and arbuscule formation in the root cortex. By contrast, the suppression of GA biosynthesis and signaling attenuated fungal entry to E. grandiflorum roots. Moreover, the exudates from GA-treated roots strongly induced the hyphal branching of R. irregularis. Our results show that GA has an contrasting effect on Paris-type AM symbiosis in E. grandiflorum compared with Arum-type AM symbiosis. This finding could be explained by the differential regulation of the early colonization stage, where fungal hyphae make contact with and penetrate the epidermis.
