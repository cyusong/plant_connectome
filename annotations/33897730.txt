Diacylglycerol acyl-transferase (DGAT) and cysteine oleosin (CO) expression confers a novel carbon sink (of encapsulated lipid droplets) in leaves of <i>Lolium perenne</i> and has been shown to increase photosynthesis and biomass. However, the physiological mechanism by which DGAT + CO increases photosynthesis remains unresolved. To evaluate the relationship between sink strength and photosynthesis, we examined fatty acids (FA), water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC), gas exchange parameters and leaf nitrogen for multiple DGAT + CO lines varying in transgene accumulation. To identify the physiological traits which deliver increased photosynthesis, we assessed two important determinants of photosynthetic efficiency, CO<sub>2</sub> conductance from atmosphere to chloroplast, and nitrogen partitioning between different photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pools. We found that DGAT + CO accumulation increased FA at the expense of WSC in leaves of <i>L. perenne</i> and for those lines with a significant reduction in WSC, we also observed an increase in photosynthesis and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. DGAT + CO <i>L. perenne</i> displayed no change in rubisco content or V<sub>cmax</sub> but did exhibit a significant increase in specific leaf area (SLA), stomatal and mesophyll conductance, and leaf nitrogen allocated to photosynthetic electron transport. Collectively, we showed that increased carbon demand <i>via</i> DGAT+CO lipid sink accumulation can induce leaf-level changes in <i>L. perenne</i> which deliver increased rates of photosynthesis and growth. Carbon sinks engineered within photosynthetic cells provide a promising new strategy for increasing photosynthesis and crop productivity.
