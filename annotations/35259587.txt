Tomato cultivation is affected by high soil salinity and drought stress, which cause major yield losses worldwide. In this work, we compare the efficiency of mechanisms of tolerance to salinity, and osmotic stress applied as mannitol or drought, in three tomato genotypes: LA-2838 (Ailsa Craig), LA-2662 (Saladette), and LA-1996 (Anthocyanin fruit - Aft), a genotype known for high anthocyanin content. Exposure to salinity or drought induced stress in all three genotypes, but the LA-1996 plants displayed superior tolerance to stress compared with the other two genotypes. They were more efficient in anthocyanin and proline accumulation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) activity, and leaf Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. In addition, they suffered lesser oxidative damage as measured by chlorophyll (Chl) loss and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation, and bioassays showed that they were less affected in terms of seed germination and root elongation. Exposure to stress induced the upregulation of stress-related genes SlNCED1, SlAREB1, SlABF4, SlWRKY8, and SlDREB2A more efficiently in LA-1996 than in the two susceptible genotypes. Conversely, the upregulation of the NADPH oxidase gene SlRBOH1 was more pronounced in LA-2838 and LA-2662. Principal component analysis showed obvious distinction between the tolerant genotype LA-1996 and the susceptible LA-2838 and LA-2662 in response to stress, and association of leaf and stem anthocyanin content with major stress tolerance traits. We suggest that anthocyanin accumulation can be considered as a marker of stress tolerance in tomato, and that LA-1996 can be considered for cultivation in salinity- or drought-affected areas.
