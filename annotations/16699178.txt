The effects of butanol on microtubules (MTs) were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Fragmentation of cortical MTs was induced by n-butanol, but not by s- and t-butanols, in cultured tobacco BY-2 cells. Taxol prevented n-butanol-induced MT fragmentation. Fragmented cortical MTs were still attached to the inner face of the plasma membrane when n-butanol-treated protoplasts were ruptured on the slide glass. Moreover, MTs were depolymerized in the presence of n-butanol in vitro. Therefore, n-butanol is not only an activator of phospholipase D but also an effective MT-depolymerizing agent.

n-butanol: !induces! MT fragmentation 
Taxol: !prevents! n-butanol-induced MT fragmentation 
n-butanol: !depolymerizes! MTs in vitro
