Carbon translocation in plants is shaped by phyllotaxis and regulated by source/sink interactions that respond to the demands of growth and defense. We have studied this extensively in poplar saplings, and recently showed that unlike carbon import, nitrogen is not translocated to sink leaves in response to application of jasmonic acid. Here we report that this is also true for young trees in the field. We discuss the importance of transport processes in establishing local C:N ratios, and suggest that the JA-induced flow of C but not N to sink tissues, and their corresponding increases in C-based defenses, may simply reflect a plant adaptation to handle excess reduced carbon and energy.
