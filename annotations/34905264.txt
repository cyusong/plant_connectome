Slow development has been shown to be a general mechanism to restore the fertility of thermo-sensitive and photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS and PGMS) lines in Arabidopsis. rpg1 is a TGMS line defective in primexine, which is essential for pollen wall pattern formation. Here, we showed that RPG1-GFP was highly expressed in microsporocytes, microspores, and pollen grains but not in the tapetum in the complemented transgenic line, suggesting that microsporocytes are the main sporophytic cells for primexine formation. Further cytological observations showed that primexine formation in rpg1 was partially restored under slow growth conditions, leading to its fertility restoration. RPG2 is the homolog of RPG1 in Arabidopsis. We revealed that the fertility recovery of rpg1 rpg2 was significantly reduced compared with that of rpg1 under low temperature. The RPG2-GFP protein was also expressed in microsporocytes in the RPG2-GFP (WT) transgenic line. These results suggest that RPG2 plays a redundant role in rpg1 fertility restoration. rpg1 plants were male sterile at the early growth stage, while their fertility was partially restored at the late developmental stage. The fertility of the rpg1 lateral branches was also partially restored. Further growth analysis showed that slow growth at the late reproductive stage or on the lateral branches led to fertility restoration. This work reveals the importance of gene redundancy in fertility restoration for TGMS lines and provides further insight into pollen wall pattern formation.
