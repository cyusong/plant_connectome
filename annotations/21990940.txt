['21990940', 'Necrotrophic pathogens are important plant pathogens that cause many devastating  plant diseases. Despite their impact, our understanding of the plant defense  response to necrotrophic pathogens is limited. The WRKY33 transcription factor is  important for plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens; therefore, elucidation  of its functions will enhance our understanding of plant immunity to necrotrophic  pathogens. Here, we report the identification of two WRKY33-interacting proteins,  nuclear-encoded SIGMA FACTOR BINDING PROTEIN1 (SIB1) and SIB2, which also  interact with plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerase SIGMA FACTOR1. Both SIB1 and  SIB2 contain an N-terminal chloroplast targeting signal and a putative nuclear  localization signal, suggesting that they are dual targeted. Bimolecular  fluorescence complementation indicates that WRKY33 interacts with SIBs in the  nucleus of plant cells. Both SIB1 and SIB2 contain a short VQ motif that is  important for interaction with WRKY33. The two VQ motif-containing proteins  recognize the C-terminal WRKY domain and stimulate the DNA binding activity of  WRKY33. Like WRKY33, both SIB1 and SIB2 are rapidly and strongly induced by the  necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Resistance to B. cinerea is compromised  in the sib1 and sib2 mutants but enhanced in SIB1-overexpressing transgenic  plants. These results suggest that dual-targeted SIB1 and SIB2 function as  activators of WRKY33 in plant defense against necrotrophic pathogens.', '2011 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.090571', 'Chen']
