['31575745', 'Plasmodesmata (PD) are plant-specific membrane-lined channels that create  cytoplasmic and membrane continuities between adjacent cells, thereby  facilitating cell-cell communication and virus movement. Plant cells have evolved  diverse mechanisms to regulate PD plasticity in response to numerous  environmental stimuli. In particular, during defense against plant pathogens, the  defense hormone, salicylic acid (SA), plays a crucial role in the regulation of  PD permeability in a callose-dependent manner. Here, we uncover a mechanism by  which plants restrict the spreading of virus and PD cargoes using SA signaling by  increasing lipid order and closure of PD. We showed that exogenous SA application  triggered the compartmentalization of lipid raft nanodomains through a modulation  of the lipid raft-regulatory protein, Remorin (REM). Genetic studies,  superresolution imaging, and transmission electron microscopy observation  together demonstrated that Arabidopsis REM1.2 and REM1.3 are crucial for plasma  membrane nanodomain assembly to control PD aperture and functionality. In  addition, we also found that a 14-3-3 epsilon protein modulates REM clustering  and membrane nanodomain compartmentalization through its direct interaction with  REM proteins. This study unveils a molecular mechanism by which the key plant  defense hormone, SA, triggers membrane lipid nanodomain reorganization, thereby  regulating PD closure to impede virus spreading.', '2019 Oct 15', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1911892116', 'Chen']
