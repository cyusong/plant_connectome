Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) cultivars possessing the N resistance gene to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) induce a hypersensitive response, which is accompanied by the production of phytohormones such as salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), to enclose the invaded virus at the initial site of infection, which inhibits viral multiplication and spread. SA functions as a positive regulator of TMV resistance. However, the role of JA in TMV resistance has not been fully elucidated. Exogenously applied methyl jasmonate, a methyl ester of JA, reduced local resistance to TMV and permitted systemic viral movement. Furthermore, in contrast to a previous finding, we demonstrated that silencing of CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1), a JA receptor, reduced viral accumulation in a tobacco cultivar possessing the N gene, as did that of allene oxide synthase, a JA biosynthetic enzyme. The reduction in viral accumulation in COI1-silenced tobacco plants was correlated with an increase in SA, and lowering SA levels by introducing an SA hydroxylase gene attenuated this reduction. Viral susceptibility did not change in a COI1-silenced tobacco cultivar lacking the N gene. These results suggest that JA signaling is not directly responsible for susceptibility to TMV, but is indirectly responsible for viral resistance through the partial inhibition of SA-mediated resistance conferred by the N gene, and that a balance between endogenous JA and SA levels is important for determining the degree of resistance.
