['24832541', "Root vacuolar sequestration is one of the best-conserved plant strategies to cope  with heavy metal toxicity. Here we report that zinc (Zn) tolerance in Arabidopsis  requires the action of a novel Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporter.  We show that ZIF2 (Zinc-Induced Facilitator 2) localises primarily at the  tonoplast of root cortical cells and is a functional transporter able to mediate  Zn efflux when heterologously expressed in yeast. By affecting plant tissue  partitioning of the metal ion, loss of ZIF2 function exacerbates plant  sensitivity to excess Zn, while its overexpression enhances Zn tolerance. The  ZIF2 gene is Zn-induced and an intron retention event in its 5'UTR generates two  splice variants (ZIF2.1 and ZIF2.2) encoding the same protein. Importantly, high  Zn favours production of the longer ZIF2.2 transcript, which compared to ZIF2.1  confers greater Zn tolerance to transgenic plants by promoting higher root Zn  immobilization. We show that the retained intron in the ZIF2 5'UTR enhances  translation in a Zn-responsive manner, markedly promoting ZIF2 protein expression  under excess Zn. Moreover, Zn regulation of translation driven by the ZIF2.2  5'UTR depends largely on a predicted stable stem loop immediately upstream of the  start codon that is lost in the ZIF2.1 5'UTR. Collectively, our findings indicate  that alternative splicing controls the levels of a Zn-responsive mRNA variant of  the ZIF2 transporter to enhance plant tolerance to the metal ion.", '2014', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1004375', 'Duque']
