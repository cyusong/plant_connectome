Regulation of branching within perennial prostrate clonal herbs differs from the annual orthotropic species, Arabidopsis and pea, as the dominant signal transported from roots is a branching promoter, not an inhibitor. Trifolium repens, an exemplar of such prostrate species, was used to investigate the interaction between roots and branch development. This study tests whether or not current knowledge when synthesized into a predictive model is sufficient to simulate the branching pattern developing on the shoot distal to a basal root. The major concepts underpinning the model are: (i) bud outgrowth (activation) is stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by branching promoter signals from roots, (ii) the distribution of this net root stimulus (NRS) is uniform throughout the shoot system distal to the basal root but declines geometrically in intensity upon continued enlargement of this shoot system, and (iii) each bud has an outgrowth potential, equal to the activation level of the apical bud in which it forms, that moderates its response to NRS. The validity of these concepts was further tested by running simulations of the branching of a phylogenetically-distanced prostrate perennial monocotyledonous species, Tradescantia fluminensis. For both species the model reasonably accounted for the observed pattern of branching. The outgrowth potential of buds plays an important role in limiting the number of hierarchies of branching that can develop on a plant. In conclusion, for both species, the model accounted for the major factors involved in the correlative regulation of branching and is possibly also pertinent for all prostrate clonal species.
