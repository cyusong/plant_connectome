CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation are widely-used plant biotechnology tools derived from bacterial immunity-related systems, each involving DNA modification. The Cas9 endonuclease introduces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and the A. tumefaciens T-DNA is released by the VirD2 endonuclease assisted by VirDl and attached by VirE2, and transferred to the plant nucleus and integrated into genome. Here, we explored the potential for synergy between the two systems and found that Cas9 and three virulence (Vir) proteins achieve precise genome editing via the homology directed repair (HDR) pathway. The HDR frequency of foreign GFPm gene in CvDT system(Cas9-VirD2, VirD1, VirE2) was increased 52-fold or 22-fold respectively compared to Cas9T (Cas9, VirD1, VirE2) or CvD system (Cas9-VirD2). Further optimization of the CvDT process with a donor linker (CvDTL) could achieve a remarkable increase in the efficiency of HDR-mediated genome editing. Additionally, the HDR efficiency of three rice endogenous genes OsPDS, OsALS and OsNRT1.1B were respectively increased 24-, 32- and 16-fold in CvDTL system compared to corresponding Cas9TL. Our results suggest that collaboration of CRISPR/Cas9 and Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation are able to make a great progress in highly efficient and precise genome editing via HDR pathway.
