Dehydration responsive element binding (DREB) factors or CRT element binding factors (CBFs) are members of the AP2/ERF family, which comprises a large number of stress-responsive regulatory genes. This review traverses almost two decades of research, from the discovery of DREB/CBF factors to their optimization for application in plant biotechnology. In this review, we describe (i) the discovery, classification, structure, and evolution of DREB genes and proteins; (ii) induction of DREB genes by abiotic stresses and involvement of their products in stress responses; (iii) protein structure and DNA binding selectivity of different groups of DREB proteins; (iv) post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms of DREB transcription factor (TF) regulation; and (v) physical and/or functional interaction of DREB TFs with other proteins during plant stress responses. We also discuss existing issues in applications of DREB TFs for engineering of enhanced stress tolerance and improved performance under stress of transgenic crop plants.
