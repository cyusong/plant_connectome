<i>Neocamarosporium betae</i> (syn. <i>Phoma betae</i>, <i>Pleospora betae</i>) is the cause of Phoma leaf spot and root decay on <i>Beta vulgaris</i> worldwide. Despite the economic importance of the pathogen, many aspects of its life cycle and population biology remain unknown. The first genome assembly of <i>N. betae</i> was constructed to facilitate identification of mating-type loci and development of microsatellite markers for population genetics studies. The de novo assembled genome is provided as a resource for future genetic studies to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying disease development and host-pathogen interactions.
