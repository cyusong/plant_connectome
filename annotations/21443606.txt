Under environmental stresses, plant development is adaptively modulated. This modulation is influenced by the steady-state balance (homeostasis) between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phytohormones. Frequently observed symptoms in plant stress adaptation responses include growth retardation, reduced metabolism and photosynthesis, reallocation of metabolic resources and increased antioxidant activities to maximize plant survival under adverse environmental conditions. In view of stress-induced morphogenetic changes during adaptation, ROS and auxin are the main players in the regulatory networks because both are strongly affected by exposure to environmental cues. However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between ROS and auxin are poorly understood. In this review, we aim at surveying how the integration of environmental stress-related signals is modulated by crosstalk between ROS and auxin regulatory networks.
