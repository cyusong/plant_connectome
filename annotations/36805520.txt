Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) is a latex-producing plant that often encounters mechanical wounding, as well as pathogen and pest attacks through wound sites during and after tapping. Terpenoids play an important role in the ecological interactions of many plant species, and their diversity is mainly generated by enzymes known as terpene synthases (TPS). In this study, one cDNA sequence encoding a putative terpene synthase, HbTPS20, was obtained from the bark tissues of H. brasiliensis. The encoded protein contains 610 amino acids with a putative N-terminal plastid transit peptide of approximately 70 residues. It belongs to the TPS-b subfamily. Further phylogenetic analysis showed that HbTPS20 formed a separate branch that diverged from the progenitor of all other potentially functional terpene synthases of the rubber TPS-b subfamily. The truncated HbTPS20 without the signal peptide coding sequence was successfully expressed in E. coli and in vitro enzymatic assays with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) or neryl diphosphate (NPP) as a substrate defined HbTPS20 as an active linalool synthase (HbLIS) with the ability to produce linalool as the principal product. RT-qPCR analysis showed that the highest transcript levels of HbTPS20 were found in barks, and this gene was expressed at 2.26- and 250-fold greater levels in the bark tissues of wounded and MeJA-treated plants, respectively, than in those of the control plants. This indicates that this gene may be involved in the induced stress responses of rubber.
