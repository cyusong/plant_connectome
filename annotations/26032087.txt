KAT1-type channels mediate K(+) influx into guard cells that enables stomatal opening. In this study, a KAT1-type channel AmKAT1 was cloned from the xerophyte Ammopiptanthus mongolicus. In contrast to most KAT1-type channels, its activation is strongly dependent on external K(+) concentration, so it can be used as a model to explore the mechanism for the K(+) -dependent gating of KAT1-type channels. Domain swapping between AmKAT1 and KAT1 reveals that the S5-pore-S6 region controls the K(+) dependence of AmKAT1, and residue substitutions show that multiple residues within the S5-Pore linker and Pore are involved in its K(+) -dependent gating. Importantly, complex interactions occur among these residues, and it is these interactions that determine its K(+) dependence. Finally, we analyzed the potential mechanism for the K(+) dependence of AmKAT1, which could originate from the requirement of K(+) occupancy in the selectivity filter to maintain its conductive conformation. These results provide new insights into the molecular basis of the K(+) -dependent gating of KAT1-type channels.
