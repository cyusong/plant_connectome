The target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway has emerged as a central hub synchronizing plant growth according to the nutrient/energy status and environmental inputs. Molecular mechanisms through which TOR promotes plant growth involve the positive regulation of transcription of cell proliferation-associated genes, mRNA translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis, to cite a few examples. Phytohormones, light, sugars, and sulfur have been found to broadly regulate TOR activity. TOR operates as a metabolic homeostat to fine-tune anabolic processes and efficiently enable plant growth under different circumstances. However, little is known about the multiple effectors that act up- and downstream of TOR. Here, we mainly discuss recent findings related to the TOR pathway in the context of plant metabolism and highlight areas of interest that need to be addressed to keep unravelling the intricate networks governing the regulation of TOR and its function in controlling biosynthetic growth.
