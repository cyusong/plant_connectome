The role of plant-derived smoke, which is changed in mineral-nutrient status, in enhancing germination and post-germination was effectively established. The majority of plant species positively respond to plant-derived smoke in the enhancement of seed germination and plant growth. The stimulatory effect of plant-derived smoke on normally growing and stressed plants may help to reduce economic and human resources, which validates its candidature as a biostimulant. Plant-derived smoke potentially facilitates the early harvest and increases crop productivity. Karrikins and cyanohydrin are the active compound in plant-derived smoke. In this review, data from the latest research explaining the effect of plant-derived smoke on morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses of plants are presented. The pathway for reception and interaction of compounds of plant-derived smoke at the cellular and molecular level of plant is described and discussed.
