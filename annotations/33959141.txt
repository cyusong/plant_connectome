Ovate family proteins (OFPs) are a family of plant growth regulators that play diverse roles in many aspects of physiological processes. OFPs have been characterized in various plant species including tomato, <i>Arabidopsis</i>, and rice. However, little is known about OFPs in woody species. Here, a total of 30 <i>PtOFP</i> genes were identified from the genome of <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> and were further grouped into four subfamilies based on their sequence similarities. Gene expression analysis indicated that some members of the <i>PtOFP</i> gene family displayed tissue/organ-specific patterns. Analysis of <i>cis</i>-acting elements in the promoter as well as gene expression by hormone treatment revealed putative involvement of <i>PtOFPs</i> in hormonal response. Furthermore, PtOFP1 (Potri.006G107700) was further experimentally demonstrated to act as a transcriptional repressor. Yeast two-hybrid assay showed physical interactions of PtOFP1 with other proteins, which suggests that they might function in various cellular processes by forming protein complexes. In addition, overexpression of <i>PtOFP1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> conferred enhanced tolerance to PEG-induced drought stress at seedling stage, as well as a higher survival rate than the wild type at mature stage. These results provide a systematic analysis of the <i>Populus OFP</i> gene family and lay a foundation for functional characterization of this gene family.
