The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the major route for protein degradation in eukaryotes. We show here that this pathway can be inhibited in Arabidopsis thaliana by expression of a ubiquitin variant that contains Arg instead of Lys at position 48 (ubR48). A major consequence of ubR48 expression is the induction of cell death. Cell death induction coincides with the appearance of reactive oxygen intermediates, but is independent of salicylic acid. We found changes in expression of some defense-related genes, but these changes are apparently insufficient to cause alterations in the response to a bacterial pathogen. Expression of ubR48 from an inducible gene allowed investigation of kinetic parameters of cell death induction. In the absence of additional stress factors, slow death processes dominate if the transgene is induced in seedlings older than 2 weeks. The inducible gene also allowed isolation of suppressor mutants. Expression of ubR48 may cause changes similar to inhibition of the proteasome, which also induces various forms of cell death. Thus, ubR48 is a tool to manipulate protein turnover and to probe cell death programs in plants.
