['20077023', 'Calcium serves as a critical messenger in many adaptation and developmental  processes. Cellular calcium signals are detected and transmitted by sensor  molecules such as calcium-binding proteins. In plants, the calcineurin B-like  protein (CBL) family represents a unique group of calcium sensors and plays a key  role in decoding calcium transients by specifically interacting with and  regulating a family of CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). In this study, we  report the role of Arabidopsis CBL5 gene in high salt or drought tolerance. CBL5  gene is expressed significantly in green tissues, but not in roots. CBL5 was not  induced by abiotic stress conditions such as high salt, drought or low  temperature. To determine whether the CBL5 gene plays a role in stress response  pathways, we ectopically expressed the CBL5 protein in transgenic Arabidopsis  plants (35S-CBL5) and examined plant responses to abiotic stresses.  CBL5-overexpressing plants displayed enhanced tolerance to high salt or drought  stress. CBL5 overexpression also rendered plants more resistant to high salt or  hyperosmotic stress during early development (i.e., seed germination) but did not  alter their response to abiscisic acid (ABA). Furthermore, overexpression of CBL5  alters the gene expression of stress gene markers, such as RD29A, RD29B and Kin1  etc. These results suggest that CBL5 may function as a positive regulator of salt  or drought responses in plants.', '2010 Feb 28', 'Mol Cells', '10.1007/s10059-010-0025-z', 'Luan']
