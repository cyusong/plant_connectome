Stress responses depend on the correct regulation of gene expression. The discovery that abiotic as well as biotic stresses can regulate miRNA levels, coupled with the identification and functional analyses of stress-associated genes as miRNA targets, provided clues about the vital role that several miRNAs may play in modulating plant resistance to stresses. Nitrogen availability seriously affects crops productivity and environment and the understanding of the miRNA-guided stress regulatory networks should provide new tools for the genetic improvement of nitrogen use efficiency of crops. A recent study revealed the potential role of a number of nitrate-responsive miRNAs in the maize adaptation to nitrate fluctuations. In particular, results obtained suggested that a nitrate depletion might regulate the expression of genes involved in the starvation adaptive response, by affecting the spatio-temporal expression patterns of specific miRNAs.
