Waterlogging is a severe environmental stress that causes severe crop productivity losses. Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) survives waterlogging by producing adventitious roots (ARs) that enhance gas exchange. Little is known about the role of light and sugars in the waterlogging-induced production of ARs. The role of these factors in AR production was therefore studied in cucumber seedlings grown in the absence or presence of waterlogging and different light conditions. The effect of photosynthesis was studied by removing the shoots of the seedlings and replacing them with exogenous applications of sucrose or stachyose. Shoot removal inhibited AR emergence and elongation. However, the exogenous application of sugars fully restored AR emergence and partially restored root elongation. The exogenous application of a synthetic auxin restored AR emergence but not AR elongation. Transcriptome profiling analysis was used to determine the effects of light on gene expression in the hypocotyls under these conditions. The levels of transcripts encoding proteins involved in auxin transport and signalling were higher in the light and following the exogenous application of sucrose and stachyose. These results show that the waterlogging-induced emergence of ARs is regulated by the interaction between sugars and auxin, whereas AR elongation depends only on sugars alone.
