The NAC transcription factor (TF) is one of the largest families of TFs in plants and plays an important role in plant growth, development, and response to environmental stress. The structural and functional characteristics of NAC TFs have been uncovered in the past years, including sequence binding features of the DNA-binding domain located in the N-terminus and dynamic interplay between the domain located at the C-terminus and other proteins. Studies on NAC TF are increasing in number; these studies distinctly contribute to our understanding of the regulatory networks of NAC-mediated complex signaling and transcriptional reprogramming. Previous studies have indicated that NAC TFs are key regulators of the plant stress response. However, these studies have been for six years so far and mainly focused on drought and salt stress. There are relatively few reports about NAC TFs in plant cold signal pathway and no related reviews have been published. In this review article, we summarize the structural features of NAC TFs, the target genes, upstream regulators and interaction proteins of stress-responsive NAC TFs, and the roles NAC TFs play in plant cold stress signal pathway.
