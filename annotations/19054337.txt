['19054337', 'Arabidopsis contains only one functional dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) gene,  but several DFR-like genes encoding proteins with the conserved NAD(P)H binding  domain. At4g35420, named DRL1 (Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase-like1), is a closely  related homolog of the rice anther-specific gene OsDFR2 reported previously. Two  T-DNA mutants (drl1-1 and drl1-2) were found to have impaired pollen formation  and seed production. Histological analysis revealed defective microspore  development after tetrad release in both mutants. Microspore walls were found to  rupture, releasing the protoplasts which eventually degenerated. The DRL1  promoter is anther-specific in closed flower buds. Promoter-GUS analysis in  transgenic Arabidopsis revealed expression in tapetum, tetrads, and developing  microspores, but not in mature anthers. Enhanced yellow fluorescent protein  (EYFP)-localization analysis demonstrated that DRL1 is a soluble cytosolic  protein that may also be localized in the nucleus. Restoration of male fertility  and seed formation was only achieved by a native promoter-DRL1 construct, but not  by a 35S-DRL1 construct, demonstrating the importance of spatial and temporal  specificities of DRL1 expression. DRL1 may be involved in a novel metabolic  pathway essential for pollen wall development. DRL1 homologs were identified as  anther- and floral-specific expressed sequence tags from different species,  suggesting that DRL1 may have a conserved functional role in male fertility in  flowering plants.', '2009', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02692.x', 'Lo']
