Physiological and molecular responses to phosphorus (P) supply and mycorrhizal infection by Glomus intraradices were compared in European (River) and African (H511) maize (Zea mays) cultivars to examine the extent to which these responses differed between plants developed for use in high- and low-nutrient-input agricultural systems. Biomass, photosynthetic rates, nutrient and carbohydrate contents, mycorrhizal colonization and nutrient-responsive phosphate transporter gene expression were measured in nonmycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants grown at different inorganic phosphorus (P(i)) supply rates. Nonmycorrhizal River plants grew poorly at low P(i) but were highly responsive to mycorrhizal infection; there were large increases in biomass, tissue P content and the rate of photosynthesis and a decline in the expression of phosphate transporter genes. Nonmycorrhizal H511 plants grew better than River plants at low P(i), and had a higher root : shoot ratio. However, the responses of H511 plants to higher P(i) supplies and mycorrhizal infection were much more limited than those of River plants. The adaptations that allowed nonmycorrhizal H511 plants to perform well in low-P soils limited their ability to respond to higher nutrient supply rates and mycorrhizal infection. The European variety had not lost the ability to respond to mycorrhizas and may have traits useful for low-nutrient agriculture where mycorrhizal symbioses are established.
