['15659100', "A multisubunit translocon of the inner envelope membrane, termed Tic, mediates  the late stages of protein import into chloroplasts. Membrane proteins, Tic110  and Tic40, and a stromal chaperone, Hsp93, have been proposed to function  together within the Tic complex. In Arabidopsis, single genes, atTIC110 and  atTIC40, encode the Tic proteins, and two homologous genes, atHSP93-V and  atHSP93-III, encode Hsp93. These four genes exhibited relatively uniform patterns  of expression, suggesting important roles for plastid biogenesis throughout  development and in all tissues. To investigate the roles played by these proteins  in vivo, we conducted a comparative study of T-DNA knockout mutants for each Tic  gene, and for the most abundantly expressed Hsp93 gene, atHSP93-V. In the  homozygous state, the tic110 mutation caused embryo lethality, implying an  essential role for atTic110 during plastid biogenesis. Homozygous tic110 embryos  exhibited retarded growth, developmental arrest at the globular stage and a  'raspberry-like' embryo-proper phenotype. Heterozygous tic110 plants, and plants  homozygous for the tic40 and hsp93-V mutations, exhibited chlorosis, aberrant  chloroplast biogenesis, and inefficient chloroplast-import of both photosynthetic  and non-photosynthetic preproteins. Non-additive interactions amongst the  mutations occurred in double mutants, suggesting that the three components may  cooperate during chloroplast protein import.", '2005 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02307.x', 'Jarvis']
