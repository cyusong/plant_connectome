The activity of transposable elements is epigenetically suppressed by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. We recently identified a direct connection between the small RNA-mediated post-transcriptional mRNA degradation of actively transcribing transposable elements and the de novo methylation of transposable element DNA, providing a mechanistic link between these two established pathways of transposable element silencing. Here we provide a model for the initiation, establishment and epigenetic maintenance of transposable element silencing that incorporates recent data in this rapidly emerging field.

Small RNA: !mediates! Post-transcriptional mRNA degradation
Transposable element DNA: !methylated by! De novo methylation
Transcriptional mechanisms: !suppress! Activity of transposable elements
Post-transcriptional mechanisms: !suppress! Activity of transposable elements
