Cutinases have been implicated as important enzymes during the process of fungal infection of aerial plant organs. The function of cutinases in the disease cycle of fungal pathogens that invade plants through the roots has been less studied. Here, functional analysis of 13 cutinase (carbohydrate esterase family 5 domain-containing) genes (VdCUTs) in the highly virulent vascular wilt pathogen Verticillium dahliae Vd991 was performed. Significant sequence divergence in cutinase family members was observed in the genome of V. dahliae Vd991. Functional analyses demonstrated that only VdCUT11, as purified protein, induced cell death and triggered defense responses in Nicotiana benthamiana, cotton, and tomato plants. Virus-induced gene silencing showed that VdCUT11 induces plant defense responses in Nicotiana benthamania in a BAK1 and SOBIR-dependent manner. Furthermore, coinfiltration assays revealed that the carbohydrate-binding module family 1 protein (VdCBM1) suppressed VdCUT11-induced cell death and other defense responses in N. benthamiana. Targeted deletion of VdCUT11 in V. dahliae significantly compromised virulence on cotton plants. The cutinase VdCUT11 is an important secreted enzyme and virulence factor that elicits plant defense responses in the absence of VdCBM1.
