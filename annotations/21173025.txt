Iron (Fe) deficiency is a major constraint for plant growth and affects the quality of edible plant parts. To investigate the mechanisms underlying Fe homeostasis in plants, Fe deficiency-induced changes in the protein profile of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots were comprehensively analyzed using iTRAQ (Isobaric Tag for Relative and Absolute Quantification) differential liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on a LTQ-Orbitrap with high-energy collision dissociation. A total of 4,454 proteins were identified with a false discovery rate of less than 1.1%, and 2,882 were reliably quantified. A subset of 101 proteins was differentially expressed upon Fe deficiency. The changes in protein profiles upon Fe deficiency show low congruency with previously reported alterations in transcript levels, indicating posttranscriptional changes, and provide complementary information on Fe deficiency-induced processes. The abundance of proteins involved in the synthesis/regeneration of S-adenosylmethionine, the phenylpropanoid pathway, the response to oxidative stress, and respiration was highly increased by Fe deficiency. Using Fe-responsive proteins as bait, genome-wide fishing for partners with predictable or confirmed interologs revealed that RNA processing and ribonucleoprotein complex assembly may represent critical processes that contribute to the regulation of root responses to Fe deficiency, possibly by biasing translation efficiency.
