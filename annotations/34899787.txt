Stomata in the plant epidermis open in response to light and regulate CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis and transpiration for uptake of water and nutrients from roots. Light-induced stomatal opening is mediated by activation of the plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells. Overexpression of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells promotes light-induced stomatal opening, enhancing photosynthesis and growth in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. In this study, transgenic hybrid aspens overexpressing Arabidopsis PM <i>H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase</i> (<i>AHA2</i>) in guard cells under the strong guard cell promoter Arabidopsis <i>GC1</i> (<i>AtGC1</i>) showed enhanced light-induced stomatal opening, photosynthesis, and growth. First, we confirmed that <i>AtGC1</i> induces GUS expression specifically in guard cells in hybrid aspens. Thus, we produced <i>AtGC1::AHA2</i> transgenic hybrid aspens and confirmed expression of <i>AHA2</i> in <i>AtGC1::AHA2</i> transgenic plants. In addition, <i>AtGC1::AHA2</i> transgenic plants showed a higher PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase protein level in guard cells. Analysis using a gas exchange system revealed that transpiration and the photosynthetic rate were significantly increased in <i>AtGC1::AHA2</i> transgenic aspen plants. <i>AtGC1::AHA2</i> transgenic plants showed a>20% higher stem elongation rate than the wild type (WT). Therefore, overexpression of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells promotes the growth of perennial woody plants.
