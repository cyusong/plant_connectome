As the seed precursor, the ovule produces the female gametophyte (or embryo sac), and the subsequent double fertilization occurs in it. The integuments emerge sequentially from the integument primordia at the early stages of ovule development and finally enwrap the embryo sac gradually during gametogenesis, protecting and nursing the embryo sac. However, the mechanisms regulating integument development are still obscure. In this study, we show that SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASES (SERKs) play essential roles during integument development in Arabidopsis thaliana. The serk1/2/3 triple mutant shows arrested integuments and abnormal embryo sacs, similar defects also found in the triple loss-of-function mutants of ERECTA family (ERf) genes. Ovules of serk1/2/3 er erl1/2 show defects similar to er erl1/2 and serk1/2/3. Results of yeast two-hybrid analyses, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analyses, and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SERKs interact with ERf, which depends on EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE (EPFL) family small peptides. The sextuple mutant epfl1/2/3/4/5/6 shows integument defects similar to both of er erl1/2 and serk1/2/3. Our results demonstrate that ERf-SERK-mediated EPFL signaling orchestrates the development of the female gametophyte and the surrounding sporophytic integuments.
