Upward long-distance mobile silencing has been shown to be phloem mediated in several different solanaceous species. We show that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedling grafting system and a counterpart inducible system generate upwardly spreading long-distance silencing that travels not in the phloem but by template-dependent reiterated short-distance cell-to-cell spread through the cells of the central stele. Examining the movement of the silencing front revealed a largely unrecognized zone of tissue, below the apical meristem, that is resistant to the silencing signal and that may provide a gating or protective barrier against small RNA signals. Using a range of auxin and actin transport inhibitors revealed that, in this zone, alteration of vesicular transport together with cytoskeleton dynamics prevented or retarded the spread of the silencing signal. This suggests that small RNAs are transported from cell to cell via plasmodesmata rather than diffusing from their source in the phloem.
