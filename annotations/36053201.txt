['36053201', 'In multicellular eukaryotes, autophagy is a conserved process that delivers  cellular components to the vacuole or lysosome for recycling during development  and stress responses. Induction of autophagy activates AUTOPHAGY-RELATED PROTEIN  1 (ATG1) and ATG13 to form a protein kinase complex that initiates autophagosome  formation. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of  this protein complex in plants remains unclear. Here, we determined that in  Arabidopsis thaliana, the regulatory proteins 14-3-3lambda and 14-3-3kappa redundantly  modulate autophagy dynamics by facilitating SEVEN IN ABSENTIA OF ARABIDOPSIS  THALIANA (SINAT)-mediated proteolysis of ATG13a and ATG13b. 14-3-3lambda and 14-3-3kappa  directly interacted with SINATs and ATG13a/b in vitro and in vivo. Compared to  wild-type (WT), the 14-3-3lambda 14-3-3kappa double mutant showed increased tolerance to  nutrient starvation, delayed leaf senescence, and enhanced starvation-induced  autophagic vesicles. Moreover, 14-3-3s were required for SINAT1-mediated  ubiquitination and degradation of ATG13a. Consistent with their roles in ATG  degradation, the 14-3-3lambda 14-3-3kappa double mutant accumulated higher levels of  ATG1a/b/c and ATG13a/b than the WT upon nutrient deprivation. Furthermore, the  specific association of 14-3-3s with phosphorylated ATG13a was crucial for ATG13a  stability and formation of the ATG1-ATG13 complex. Thus, our findings demonstrate  that 14-3-3lambda and 14-3-3kappa function as molecular adaptors to regulate autophagy by  modulating the homeostasis of phosphorylated ATG13.', '2022 Nov 29', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koac273', 'ORCID:']
