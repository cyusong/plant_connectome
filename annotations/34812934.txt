This review describes the interaction of gaseous signaling molecules and MAPK cascade components, which further reveals the specific mechanism of the crosstalk between MAPK cascade components and gaseous signaling molecules. Plants have evolved complex and sophisticated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades that are engaged in response to environmental stress. There is currently compelling experimental evidence that gaseous signaling molecules are involved in MAPK cascades. During stress, nitric oxide (NO) activates MAPK cascades to transmit stimulus signals, and MAPK cascades also regulate NO biosynthesis to mediate NO-dependent physiological processes. Activated MAPK cascades lead to phosphorylation of specific sites of aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid synthase to regulate the ethylene biosynthesis-signaling pathway. Hydrogen sulfide functions upstream of MAPKs and regulates the MAPK signaling pathway at the transcriptional level. Here, we describe the function and signal transduction of gaseous signaling molecules involved in MAPK cascades and focus on introducing and discussing the recent data obtained in this field concerning the interaction of gaseous signaling molecules and MAPK cascades. In addition, this article outlines the direction and challenges of future work and further reveals the specific mechanism of the crosstalk between MAPK cascade components and gaseous signaling molecules.
