In lily reproduction, the mechanism of formation of bulbs has been a hot topic. However, studies on stem bulblet formation are limited. Stem bulblets, formed in the leaf axils of under- and above-ground stems, provide lilies with a strong capacity for self-propagation. First, we showed that above-ground stem bulblets can be induced by spraying 100 mg/L 6-BA on the LA hybrid lily 'Aladdin', with reduced endogenous IAA and GA<sub>4</sub> and a higher relative content of cytokinins. Then, expression patterns of three potential genes (two <i>KNOTTED1</i>-like homeobox (<i>KNOX</i>) and one partial <i>BEL1</i>-like homeobox (<i>BELL</i>)), during stem bulblet formation from our previous study, were determined by RT-qPCR, presenting a down-up trend in <i>KNOX</i>s and a rising tendency in <i>BELL</i>. The partial <i>BELL</i> gene was cloned by RACE from <i>L</i>. 'Aladdin' and denoted <i>LaBEL1</i>. Physical interactions of LaKNOX1-LaBEL1 and LaKNOX1-LaKNOX2 were confirmed by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Furthermore, hormonal regulatory patterns of single LaKNOX1, LaKNOX2, LaBEL1, and their heterodimers, were revealed in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>, suggesting that the massive mRNA accumulations of <i>LaKNOX1</i>, <i>LaKNOX2</i> and <i>LaBEL1</i> genes during stem bulblet formation could cause the dramatic relative increase of cytokinins and the decline of GAs and IAA. Taken together, a putative model was proposed that LaKNOX1 interacts with LaKNOX2 and LaBEL1 to regulate multiple phytohormones simultaneously for an appropriate hormonal homeostasis, which suggests their potential role in stem bulblet formation in <i>L</i>. 'Aladdin'.
