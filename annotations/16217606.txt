T-DNA and transposable elements e.g., Ds and Tos17, are used to generate a large number of insertional mutant lines in rice. Some carry the GUS or GFP reporter for gene trap or enhancer trap. These reporter systems are valuable for identifying tissue- or organ-preferential genes. Activation tagging lines have also been generated for screening mutants and isolating mutagenized genes. To utilize these resources more efficiently, tagged lines have been produced for reverse genetic approaches. DNA pools of the T-DNA tagged lines and Tos17 lines have been prepared for PCR screening of insertional mutants in a given gene. Tag end sequences (TES) of the inserts have also been produced. TES databases are beneficial for analyzing the function of a large number of rice genes.
