Cell wall-related nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) theoretically supply the cytosolic nucleotide sugars for glycosyltransferases (GTs) to carry out ploysaccharide synthesis and modification in the Golgi apparatus. However, the regulation of cell wall synthesis by NSTs remains undescribed. Recently, we have reported the functional characterization of Oryza sativa nucleotide sugar transport (Osnst1) mutant and its corresponding gene. OsNST1/BC14 is localized in the Golgi apparatus and transports UDP-glucose. This mutant provides us with a unique opportunity for evaluation of its abroad impacts on cell wall structure and components. We previously examined cell wall composition of bc14 and wild type plants. Here, the spatial distribution of these cell wall alterations was analyzed by immunolabeling approach. Analysis of the sugar yield in different cell wall fractions indicated that this mutation improves the extractability of cell wall components. Field emission scanning electron microscopy further showed that the orientation of microfibrils in bc14 is irregular when compared to that in wild type. Therefore, this UDP-glucose transporter, making substrates available for polysaccharide biosynthesis, plays a critical role in maintaining cell wall integrity.
