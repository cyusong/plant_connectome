['17213228', 'Higher plants have two metabolic pathways for isoprenoid biosynthesis: the  cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the plastidal non-mevalonate (MEP)  pathway. Despite the compartmentalization of these two pathways, metabolic flow  occurs between them. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate  the two pathways and the metabolic cross-talk. To identify such regulatory  mechanisms, we isolated and characterized the Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant  lovastatin insensitive 1 (loi1), which is resistant to lovastatin and clomazone,  inhibitors of the MVA and MEP pathways, respectively. The accumulation of the  major products of these pathways, i.e. sterols and chlorophyll, was less affected  by lovastatin and clomazone, respectively, in loi1 than in the wild type.  Furthermore, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) activity  analysis showed higher activity of HMGR in loi1-1 treated with lovastatin than  that in the WT. We consider that the lovastatin-resistant phenotype of loi1-1 was  derived from this post-transcriptional up-regulation of HMGR. The LOI1 gene  encodes a novel pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein. PPR proteins are thought  to regulate the expression of genes encoded in organelle genomes by  post-transcriptional regulation in mitochondria or plastids. Our results  demonstrate that LOI1 is predicted to localize in mitochondria and has the  ability to bind single-stranded nucleic acids. Our investigation revealed that  the post-transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial RNA may be involved in  isoprenoid biosynthesis in both the MVA and MEP pathways.', '2007 Feb', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcm005', 'Muranaka']
