['24424325', 'Stomatins belong to the band-7 protein family, a diverse group of conserved  eukaryotic and prokaryotic membrane proteins involved in the formation of large  protein complexes as protein-lipid scaffolds. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) genome contains two paralogous genes encoding stomatin-like proteins  (SLPs; AtSLP1 and AtSLP2) that are phylogenetically related to human SLP2, a  protein involved in mitochondrial fusion and protein complex formation in the  mitochondrial inner membrane. We used reverse genetics in combination with  biochemical methods to investigate the function of AtSLPs. We demonstrate that  both SLPs localize to mitochondrial membranes. SLP1 migrates as a large  (approximately 3 MDa) complex in blue-native gel electrophoresis. Remarkably,  slp1 knockout mutants have reduced protein and activity levels of complex I and  supercomplexes, indicating that SLP affects the assembly and/or stability of  these complexes. These findings point to a role for SLP1 in the organization of  respiratory supercomplexes in Arabidopsis.', '2014 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.230383', 'Sweetlove']
