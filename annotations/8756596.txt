['8756596', 'Allene oxide synthase, an enzyme of the octadecanoid pathway to jasmonates, was  cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana as a full-length cDNA encoding a polypeptide of  517 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 58705 Da. From the sequence,  an N-terminal transit peptide of 21 amino acids resembling chloroplast transit  peptides was deduced. Three out of four invariant amino acid residues of  cytochrome P450 heme-binding domains are conserved and properly positioned in the  enzyme coding region, including the heme-accepting cysteine (Cys-470). Southern  analysis indicated in A. thaliana only one allene oxide synthase gene to be  present. While transcript levels were rapidly and transiently induced after  wounding of the leaves, allene oxide synthase activity remained nearly constant  at a low level of ca. 0.8 nkat per mg of protein. The cDNA encoding A. thaliana  allene oxide synthase was highly expressed in bacteria giving rise to a  polypeptide of the calculated molecular mass. The protein was enzymatically  active, and verification of the reaction products by GC-MS showed that it was  capable of utilizing not only 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid (13-hydroperoxy-9(Z),  11(E), 15(Z)-octadecatrienoic acid), but also 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid  (13-hydroperoxy-9(Z), 11(E)-octadecadienoic acid) as substrate. The data suggest  parallel pathways to jasmonates from linolenic acid or linoleic acid in A.  thaliana.', '1996 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/BF00021793', 'Weiler']
