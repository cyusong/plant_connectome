['31178399', 'Plants exhibit different flowering behaviors in response to variable photoperiods  across a wide geographical range. Here, we identify MYC3, a bHLH transcription  factor, and its cis-element form the long-sought regulatory module responsible  for cis-regulatory changes at the florigen gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) that  mediate natural variation in photoperiodic flowering responses in Arabidopsis.  MYC3 is stabilized by DELLAs in the gibberellin pathway to suppress FT through  binding the ACGGAT motif and antagonizing CONSTANS (CO) activation. Changing  photoperiods modulate the relative abundance of MYC3 and CO, thus determining  either of them as the predominant regulator for FT expression under different day  lengths. Cis-regulatory changes in the MYC3 binding site at FT are associated  with natural variation in day-length requirement for flowering in Arabidopsis  accessions. Our findings reveal that environmental and developmental signals  converge at MYC3 suppression of FT, an elementary event underlying natural  variation in photoperiodic flowering responses.', '2019 Jul 1', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2019.05.018', 'Yu']
