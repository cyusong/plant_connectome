Chemically deuterated cellulose fiber was expected to provide novel applications due to its spectral, biological, and kinetic isotope effect. In this research, the performance of the chemically deuterated cotton fibers, including their mechanical property, enzymatic degradation performance, effect on bacterial treatment, and fast identification (near-infrared modeling) was investigated. The breaking tenacity of the deuterated cotton fibers was slightly lower, which might be attributed to the structural damage during the chemical deuteration. The glucose yield by enzymatic hydrolysis was less than that of the protonic cotton fibers, implying the deuterated fibers are less sensitive to enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, the deuterated fibers could promote the growth of bacteria such as <i>Escherichia. coli</i>, which was associated with the released low-level deuterium content. At last, the near-infrared technique combined with partial least squares regression successfully achieved a fast identification of the protiated and deuterated cotton fibers, which significantly promoted the potential application of deuterated cellulose as anticounterfeiting materials (e.g., special paper).
