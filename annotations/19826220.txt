Plant cells contain a mixture of 26S and 20S proteasomes that mediate ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent proteolysis, respectively. The 26S proteasome contains the 20S proteasome and one or two regulatory particles that are required for ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Comparative analyses of Arabidopsis proteasome mutants revealed that a decrease in 26S proteasome biogenesis causes heat shock hypersensitivity and reduced cell division rates that are compensated by increased cell expansion. Loss of 26S proteasome function also leads to an increased 20S proteasome biogenesis, which in turn enhances the cellular capacity to degrade oxidized proteins and thus increases oxidative stress tolerance. These findings suggest the intriguing possibility that 26S and 20S proteasome activities are regulated to control plant development and stress responses. This mini-review highlights some of the recent studies on proteasome regulation in plants.
