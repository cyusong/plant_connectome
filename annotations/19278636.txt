The current paradigm for plant morphogenesis dictates that cortical microtubules serve as a template for the assembly of the cellulosic wall which, in turn, controls cell expansion. A new study provides direct evidence that tissue-level tension can serve as a mechanical signal to align cortical microtubules, thus establishing a critical feedback mechanism for the morphogenetic process.
