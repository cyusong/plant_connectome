The TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR (TCP) gene family, a kind of plant specific transcription factor, is essential for stress response, cell growth, and cell proliferation. However, the characterization of TCP family is still not clear in Pak-choi [<i>Brassica campestris</i> (syn. <i>Brassica rapa</i>) ssp. <i>chinensis</i> var. <i>communis</i>]. In this study, genome-wide analysis of TCP gene family was performed and 26 <i>TCP</i> genes were identified in Pak-choi. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the 26 BcTCPs were divided into two classes: Class I and Class II. Class II was further classified into two subclasses, CIN and CYC/TB1. The qPCR results suggested that most <i>BcTCPs</i> respond to abiotic stresses. The expressions of <i>BcTCP3</i>, <i>BcTCP12</i>, <i>BcTCP21</i>, and <i>BcTCP22</i> were significantly changed under ABA and cold treatment. <i>BcTCP3</i> and <i>BcTCP12</i> were also up-regulated under osmotic treatment. Subcellular localization showed that BcTCP3 and BcTCP21 were located in the nucleus. Our results will facilitate revealing the functions and regulatory mechanisms of <i>BcTCPs</i>.
