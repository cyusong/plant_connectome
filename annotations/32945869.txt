Mediator, a multisubunit protein complex, is a signal processor that conveys regulatory information from transcription factors to RNA polymerase II and therefore plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. This megadalton complex comprises four modules, namely, the head, middle, tail, and kinase modules. The first three modules form the core part of the complex, whereas association of the kinase module is facultative. The kinase module is able to alter the function of Mediator and has been established as a major transcriptional regulator of numerous developmental and biochemical processes. The kinase module consists of MED12, MED13, CycC, and kinase CDK8. Upon association with Mediator, the kinase module can alter its structure and function dramatically. In the past decade, research has established that the kinase module is very important for plant growth and development, and in the fight against biotic and abiotic challenges. However, there has been no comprehensive review discussing these findings in detail and depth. In this review, we survey the regulation of kinase module subunits and highlight their many functions in plants. Coordination between the subunits to process different signals for optimum plant growth and development is also discussed.
