['18285452', "Yeast Rrp6p and its human counterpart, PM/Scl100, are exosome-associated proteins  involved in the degradation of aberrant transcripts and processing of precursors  to stable RNAs, such as the 5.8S rRNA, snRNAs, and snoRNAs. The activity of yeast  Rrp6p is stimulated by the polyadenylation of its RNA substrates. We identified  three RRP6-like proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana: AtRRP6L3 is restricted to the  cytoplasm, whereas AtRRP6L1 and -2 have different intranuclear localizations.  Both nuclear RRP6L proteins are functional, since AtRRP6L1 complements the  temperature-sensitive phenotype of a yeast rrp6Delta strain and mutation of  AtRRP6L2 leads to accumulation of an rRNA maturation by-product. This by-product  corresponds to the excised 5' part of the 18S-5.8S-25S rRNA precursor and  accumulates as a polyadenylated transcript, suggesting that RRP6L2 is involved in  poly(A)-mediated RNA degradation in plant nuclei. Interestingly, the rRNA  maturation by-product is a substrate of AtRRP6L2 but not of AtRRP6L1. This result  and the distinctive subcellular distribution of AtRRP6L1 to -3 indicate a  specialization of RRP6-like proteins in Arabidopsis.", '2008 May', 'Mol Cell Biol', '10.1128/MCB.02064-07', 'Gagliardi']
