To explore the influences of different cultivated areas on the chemical profiles of <i>Eucommia ulmoides</i> leaves (EUL) and rapidly authenticate its geographical origins, 187 samples from 13 provinces in China were systematically investigated using three data fusion strategies (low, mid, and high level) combined with two discrimination model algorithms (partial least squares discrimination analysis; random forest, RF). RF models constructed by high-level data fusion with different modes of different spectral data (Fourier transform near-infrared spectrum and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform mid-infrared spectrum) were most suitable for identifying EULs from different geographical origins. The accuracy rates of calibration and validation set were 92.86% and 93.44%, respectively. In addition, climate parameters were systematically investigated the cluster difference in our study. Some interesting and novel information could be found from the clustering tree diagram of hierarchical cluster analysis. The Xinjiang Autonomous Region (Region 5) located in the high latitude area was the only region in the middle temperate zone of all sample collection areas in which the samples belonged to an individual class no matter their distance in the tree diagram. The samples were from a relatively high elevation in the Shennongjia Forest District in Hubei Province (>1200 m), which is the main difference from the samples from Xiangyang City (78 m). Thus, the sample clusters from region 9 are different from the sample clusters from other regions. The results would provide a reference for further research to those samples from the special cluster.
