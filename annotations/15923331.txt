Long day (LD) exposure of rosette plants causes rapid stem/petiole elongation, a more vertical growth habit, and flowering; all changes are suggestive of a role for the gibberellin (GA) plant growth regulators. For Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) L. (Heynh), we show that enhancement of petiole elongation by a far-red (FR)-rich LD is mimicked by a brief (10 min) end-of-day (EOD) FR exposure in short day (SD). The EOD response shows red (R)/FR photoreversibility and is not affected in a phytochrome (PHY) A mutant so it is mediated by PHYB and related PHYs. FR photoconversion of PHYB to an inactive form activates a signaling pathway, leading to increased GA biosynthesis. Of 10 GA biosynthetic genes, expression of the 20-oxidase, AtGA20ox2, responded most to FR (up to a 40-fold increase within 3 h). AtGA20ox1 also responded but to a lesser extent. Stimulation of petiole elongation by EOD FR is reduced in a transgenic AtGA20ox2 hairpin gene silencing line. By contrast, it was only in SD that a T-DNA insertional mutant of AtGA20ox1 (ga5-3) showed reduced response. Circadian entrainment to a daytime pattern provides an explanation for the SD expression of AtGA20ox1. Conversely, the strong EOD/LD FR responses of AtGA20ox2 may reflect its independence of circadian regulation. While FR acting via PHYB increases expression of AtGA20ox2, other GA biosynthetic genes are known to respond to R rather than FR light and/or to other PHYs. Thus, there must be different signal transduction pathways, one at least showing a positive response to active PHYB and another showing a negative response.
