Conclusions 37 Acknowledgements 37 References 37 SUMMARY: In higher plants, small noncoding RNAs and large messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are transported between cells and over long distances via the phloem. These large macromolecules are thought to get access to the sugar-conducting phloem vessels via specialized plasmodesmata (PD). Analyses of the phloem exudate suggest that all classes of RNA molecules, including silencing-induced RNAs (siRNAs), micro RNAs (miRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribosomal RNA (rRNAs) and mRNAs, are transported via the vasculature to distant tissues. Although the functions of mobile siRNAs and miRNAs as signalling molecules are well established, we lack a profound understanding of mobile mRNA function(s) in recipient cells and tissues, and how they are selected for transport. A surprisingly high number of up to thousands of mRNAs were described in diverse plant species such as cucumber, pumpkin, Arabidopsis and grapevine to move long distances over graft junctions to distinct body parts. In this review, we present an overview of the classes of mobile RNAs, the potential mechanisms facilitating RNA long-distance transport, and the roles of mobile RNAs in regulating transcription and translation. Furthermore, we address potential function(s) of mobile protein-encoding mRNAs with respect to their characteristics and evolutionary constraints.
