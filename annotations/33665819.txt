Global warming has reduced the productivity of many field-grown crops, as the effects of high temperatures can lead to male sterility in such plants. Genetic regulation of the high temperature (HT) response in the major crop cotton is poorly understood. We determined the functionality and transcriptomes of the anthers of 218 cotton accessions grown under HT stress. By analyzing transcriptome divergence and implementing a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identified three thermal tolerance associated loci which contained 75 protein coding genes and 27 long noncoding RNAs, and provided expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for 13 132 transcripts. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) confirmed six causal elements for the HT response (three genes overlapped with the GWAS results) which are involved in protein kinase activity. The most susceptible gene, GhHRK1, was confirmed to be a previously uncharacterized negative regulator of the HT response in both cotton and Arabidopsis. These functional variants provide a new understanding of the genetic basis for HT tolerance in male reproductive organs.
