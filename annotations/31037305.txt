Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the development of bamboo culm. Using anatomical, mathematical modeling, and genomics methods, we investigated the role of shoot apical meristem (SAM) in the development of the transverse morphology of bamboo culm and explored the underlying cellular and molecular processes. We discovered that maintenance of SAM morphology that can produce circular culm and increase in SAM cell numbers, especially corpus cells, is the means by which bamboo makes a larger culm with a regular pith cavity and culm wall during development. A less cellular form of SAM with a lower proportion of corpus cells causes an abnormal higher ratio of wall component cells to pith cells, which breaks the balance of their interaction and triggers the random invasion of wall component cells into pith tissues during development, and finally results in the various thick culm walls of Phyllostachys nidularia f. farcta. The smaller SAM also results in a lower level of hormones such as cytokinin and auxin, and down-regulates hormone signaling and the downstream functional genes such as those related to metabolism, which finally results in a dwarf and smaller diameter culm with lower biomass. These results provide an important perspective on the culm development of bamboo, and support a plausible mechanism causing the size-reduced culm and various thick culm walls of P. nidularia f. farcta.
