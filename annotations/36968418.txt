Chinese cabbage is one of the most important vegetable crops in China. However, the clubroot disease caused by the infection of <i>Plasmodiophora brassicae (P. brassicae)</i> has seriously affected the yield and quality of Chinese cabbage. In our previous study, <i>BrUFO</i> gene was found to be significantly up-regulated in diseased roots of Chinese cabbage after inoculation with <i>P. brassicae. UFO (UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS)</i> have the properties of substrate recognition during ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. A variety of plant can activate immunity response through the ubiquitination pathway. Therefore, it is very important to study the function of <i>UFO</i> in response to <i>P. brassicae</i>. In this study, The expression pattern of <i>BrUFO</i> Gene was measured by qRT-PCR and <i>In situ</i> Hybridization (ISH). The expression location of <i>BrUFO</i> in cells was determined by subcellular localization. The function of <i>BrUFO</i> was verified by Virus-induced Gene Silencing (VIGS). proteins interacting with BrUFO protein were screened by yeast two-hybrid. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization analysis showed that expression of <i>BrUFO</i> gene in the resistant plants was lower than that in susceptible plants. Subcellular localization analysis showed that <i>BrUFO</i> gene was expressed in the nucleus. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) analysis showed that silencing of <i>BrUFO</i> gene reduced the incidence of clubroot disease. Six proteins interacting with BrUFO protein were screened by Y<sub>2</sub>H assay. Two of them (Bra038955, a B-cell receptor-associated 31-like protein and Bra021273, a GDSL-motif esterase/acyltransferase/lipase Enzyme) were confirmed to strongly interact with BrUFO protein. <i>BrUFO</i> gene should be a key gene of chinese cabbage against the infection of <i>P. brassicae. BrUFO</i> gene silencing improves the resistance of plants to clubroot disease. BrUFO protein may interact with CUS2 to induce ubiquitination in PRR-mediated PTI reaction through GDSL lipases, so as to achieve the effect of Chinese cabbage against the infection of <i>P. brassicae.</i>
