Polyploidy (genome duplication) is thought to have contributed to the evolution of the eukaryotic genome, but complex genome structures and massive gene loss during evolution has complicated detection of these ancestral duplication events. The major factors determining the fate of duplicated genes are currently unclear, as are the processes by which duplicated genes evolve after polyploidy. Fine-scale analysis between homologous regions may allow us to better understand post-polyploidy evolution. Here, using gene-by-gene and gene-by-genome strategies, we identified the S5 region and four homologous regions within the japonica genome. Additional phylogenomic analyses of the comparable duplicated blocks indicate that four successive duplication events gave rise to these five regions, allowing us to propose a model for this local chromosomal evolution. According to this model, gene loss may play a major role in post-duplication genetic evolution at the segmental level. Moreover, we found molecular evidence that one of the sister duplicated blocks experienced more gene loss and a more rapid evolution subsequent to two recent duplication events. Given that these two recent duplication events were likely involved in polyploidy, this asymmetric evolution (gene loss and gene divergence) may be one possible mechanism accounting for the diploidization at the segmental level.
