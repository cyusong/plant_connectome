['17090544', 'A serine/threonine protein kinase that is able to phosphorylate  chloroplast-destined precursor proteins was purified from leaf extract of  Arabidopsis thaliana and was identified by mass spectrometry. The protein kinase,  encoded by AT2G17700, belongs to a small protein family comprising in addition  AT4G35780 and AT4G38470. All three proteins were expressed heterologously in  Escherichia coli and characterized with regard to their properties in precursor  protein phosphorylation. They were able to phosphorylate several  chloroplast-destined precursor proteins within their cleavable presequences. In  contrast, a mitochondria-destined precursor protein was not a substrate for these  kinases. For all three enzymes, the phosphorylation reaction was specific for ATP  with apparent K(m) values between 14 and 67 microM. They did not utilize other  NTPs nor were those able to compete for ATP in the reaction. An excess of ADP was  able to inhibit ATP-dependent phosphorylation. Furthermore, all three kinases  exhibited autophosphorylation. The protein kinases described here could represent  subunits of a regulatory network involved in the cytosolic events of chloroplast  protein import.', '2006 Dec 29', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M606580200', 'Vothknecht']
