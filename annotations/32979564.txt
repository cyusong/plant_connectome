Looking forward includes looking back every now and then. In 2007, David Weller looked back at 30 years of biocontrol of soil-borne pathogens by Pseudomonas and signified that the progress made over decades of research has provided a firm foundation to formulate current and future research questions. It has been recognized for more than a century that soil-borne microbes play a significant role in plant growth and health. The recent application of high-throughput omics technologies has enabled detailed dissection of the microbial players and molecular mechanisms involved in the complex interactions in plant-associated microbiomes. Here, we highlight old and emerging plant microbiome concepts related to plant disease control, and address perspectives that modern and emerging microbiomics technologies can bring to functionally characterize and exploit plant-associated microbiomes for the benefit of plant health in future microbiome-assisted agriculture.
