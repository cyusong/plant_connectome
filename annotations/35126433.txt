Drought is a climatic event that considerably impacts plant growth, reproduction and productivity. <i>Toona sinensis</i> is a tree species with high economic, edible and medicinal value, and has drought resistance. Thus, the objective of this study was to dynamically monitor the physiological indicators of <i>T. sinensis</i> in real time to ensure the selection of drought-resistant varieties of <i>T. sinensis</i>. In this study, we used near-infrared spectroscopy as a high-throughput method along with five preprocessing methods combined with four variable selection approaches to establish a cross-validated partial least squares regression model to establish the relationship between the near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) spectrum and physiological characteristics (i.e., chlorophyll content and nitrogen content) of <i>T. sinensis</i> leaves. We also tested optimal model prediction for the dynamic changes in <i>T. sinensis</i> chlorophyll and nitrogen content under five separate watering regimes to mimic non-destructive and dynamic detection of plant leaf physiological changes. Among them, the accuracy of the chlorophyll content prediction model was as high as 72%, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.25, and the RPD index above 2.26. Ideal nitrogen content prediction model should have <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> of 0.63, with RMSE of 0.87, and the RPD index of 1.12. The results showed that the PLSR model has a good prediction effect. Overall, under diverse drought stress treatments, the chlorophyll content of <i>T. sinensis</i> leaves showed a decreasing trend over time. Furthermore, the chlorophyll content was the most stable under the 75% field capacity treatment. However, the nitrogen content of the plant leaves was found to have a different and variable trend, with the greatest drop in content under the 10% field capacity treatment. This study showed that NIRS has great potential for analyzing chlorophyll nitrogen and other elements in plant leaf tissues in non-destructive dynamic monitoring.
