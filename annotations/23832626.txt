Cell fate determination and differentiation are central processes in the development of multicellular organisms, and the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root epidermis provides a model system to study the molecular basis of these processes. A lateral inhibition mechanism mediated by an R3 single-repeat MYB protein, CAPRICE (CPC), has been proposed to explain the specification of the two types of root epidermal cells (hair cells and nonhair cells). However, it is not clear how CPC acts preferentially in the H-position cells, rather than the N-position cells, where its gene is expressed. To explore this issue, we examined the effect of misexpressed CPC on cell fate specification and CPC localization in the root epidermis. We show that CPC is able to move readily within the root epidermis when its expression level is high and that CPC can induce the hair cell fate in a cell-autonomous manner. We provide evidence that CPC is capable of moving from the stele tissue in the center of the root to the outermost epidermal layer, where it can induce the hair cell fate. In addition, we show that CPC protein accumulates primarily in the nuclei of H-position cells in the early meristematic region, and this localization requires the H-cell-expressed ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3) basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. These results suggest that cell-cell movement of CPC occurs readily within the meristematic region of the root and that EGL3 preferentially traps the CPC protein in the H-position cells of the epidermis.
