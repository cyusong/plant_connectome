Waterlogging stress has an enormous negative impact on the kiwifruit yield and quality. The protective role of exogenous melatonin on water stress has been widely studied, especially in drought stress. However, the research on melatonin-induced waterlogging tolerance is scarce. Here, we found that treatment with exogenous melatonin could effectively alleviate the damage on kiwifruit plants in response to waterlogging treatment. This was accompanied by higher antioxidant activity and lower ROS accumulation in kiwifruit roots during stress period. The detection of changes in amino acid levels of kiwifruit roots during waterlogging stress showed a possible interaction between melatonin and amino acid metabolism, which promoted the tolerance of kiwifruit plants to waterlogging. The higher levels of GABA and Pro in the roots of melatonin-treated kiwifruit plants partly contributed to their improved waterlogging tolerance. In addition, some plant hormones were also involved in the melatonin-mediated waterlogging tolerance, such as the enhancement of ACC accumulation. This study discussed the melatonin-mediated water stress tolerance of plants from the perspective of amino acid metabolism for the first time.
