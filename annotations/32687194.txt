Cell polarity is indispensable for forming complex multicellular organisms. Proteins that polarize at specific plasma membrane domains can either serve as scaffolds for effectors or coordinate intercellular communication and transport. Here, I give an overview of polarity protein complexes and their fundamental importance for plant development, and summarize novel mechanistic insights into their molecular networks. Examples are presented for proteins that polarize at specific plasma membrane domains to orient cell division planes, alter cell fate progression, control transport, direct cell growth, read global polarity axes, or integrate external stimuli into plant growth. The recent advances in characterizing protein polarity during plant development enable a better understanding of coordinated plant growth and open up intriguing paths that could provide a means to modulate plant morphology and adaptability in the future.
