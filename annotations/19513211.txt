Ozone is the main photochemical oxidant that causes leaf damage in many plant species, and can thereby significantly decrease the productivity of crops and forests. When ozone is incorporated into plants, it produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide. These ROS induce the synthesis of several plant hormones, such as ethylene, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid. These phytohormones are required for plant growth, development, and defense responses, and regulate the extent of leaf injury in ozone-fumigated plants. Recently, responses to ozone have been studied using genetically modified plants and mutants with altered hormone levels or signaling pathways. These researches have clarified the roles of phytohormones and the complexity of their signaling pathways. The present paper reviews the biosynthesis of the phytohormones ethylene, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid, their roles in plant responses to ozone, and multiple interactions between these phytohormones in ozone-exposed plants.
