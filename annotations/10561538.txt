['10561538', 'A cDNA clone, AtELP1 (Arabidopsis thaliana EGF receptor-like protein) was  isolated from an Arabidopsis cDNA library with an oligonucleotide probe  corresponding to a highly conserved region of animal beta-integrins. The cloning  of this cDNA was previously reported and it has been proposed that AtELP might be  a receptor involved in intracellular trafficking. In the present work, using two  specific independent sets of anti-peptide antibodies, we show that AtELP1 is  mainly located in the plasma membrane, supporting another function for this  protein. Structural studies, using methods for secondary structure prediction,  indicated the presence of cysteine-rich domains specific to beta-integrins.  Database searches revealed that AtELP1 is a member of a multigenic family  composed of at least six members in A. thaliana. Northern blot analysis of  AtELP1, 2b and 3 was performed on mRNA extracted from cells cultured in normal  and stressed conditions, and from several organs and plants submitted to biotic  or abiotic stresses. All the genes are expressed at different levels in the same  conditions, but preferentially in roots, fruits and leaves in response to water  deficit.', '1999 Nov 16', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/s0005-2728(99)00087-0', 'Galaud']
