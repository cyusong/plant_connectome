In the halophyte Crithmum maritimum, the sulfolipid content increased considerably in the presence of NaCl. There were no significant changes in the total fatty acid composition of sulfolipids during salt treatment, except for linoleic and linolenic acids. In comparison to the control plants, sulfolipids in NaCl-treated plants showed a decrease in the percentage of unsaturated fatty acid (C18:3), and a corresponding increase in the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids (C18:2). As a whole, the data reported in this work suggest that sulfolipds may be one important aspect of strategies involved in salt tolerance of this halophyte.
