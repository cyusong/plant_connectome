Understanding of the influences of root-zone CO2 concentration on nitrogen (N) metabolism is limited. The influences of root-zone CO2 concentration on growth, N uptake, N metabolism and the partitioning of root assimilated 14C were determined in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). Root, but not leaf, nitrate reductase activity was increased in plants supplied with increased root-zone CO2. Root phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity was lower with NO3(-)- than with NH4(+)-nutrition, and in the latter, was also suppressed by increased root-zone CO2. Increased growth rate in NO3(-)-fed plants with elevated root-zone CO2 concentrations was associated with transfer of root-derived organic acids to the shoot and conversion to carbohydrates. With NH4(+)-fed plants, growth and total N were not altered by elevated root-zone CO2 concentrations, although 14C partitioning to amino acid synthesis was increased. Effects of root-zone CO2 concentration on N uptake and metabolism over longer periods (> 1 d) were probably limited by feedback inhibition. Root-derived organic acids contributed to the carbon budget of the leaves through decarboxylation of the organic acids and photosynthetic refixation of released CO2.
