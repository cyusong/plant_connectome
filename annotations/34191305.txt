Light is essential for plant life. It provides a source of energy through photosynthesis and regulates plant growth and development and other cellular processes, such as by controlling the endogenous circadian clock. Light intensity, quality, duration and timing are all important determinants of plant responses, especially to biotic stress. Red light can positively influence plant defence mechanisms against different pathogens, but the molecular mechanism behind this phenomenon is not fully understood. Therefore, we reviewed the impact of red light on plant biotic stress responses against viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes, with a focus on the physiological effects of red light treatment and hormonal crosstalk under biotic stress in plants. We found evidence suggesting that exposing plants to red light increases levels of salicylic acid (SA) and induces SA signalling mediating the production of reactive oxygen species, with substantial differences between species and plant organs. Such changes in SA levels could be vital for plants to survive infections. Therefore, the application of red light provides a multidimensional aspect to developing innovative and environmentally friendly approaches to plant and crop disease management.
