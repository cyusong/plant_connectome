We examined the effect of manipulating photosystem II (PSII) redox poise on respiratory flux in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. Measurements were made on wild-type (WT) plants and npq4 mutant plants deficient in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Two experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, WT and mutant warm-grown plants were exposed to three different irradiance regimes [75, 150 and 300 micromol photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)], and leaf dark respiration was measured in conjunction with PSII redox poise. In the second experiment, WT and mutant warm-grown plants were shifted to 5 degrees C and 75, 150 or 300 micromol PAR, and dark respiration was measured alongside PSII redox poise in cold-treated and cold-developed leaves. Despite significant differences in PSII redox poise between genotypes and irradiance treatments, neither genotype nor growth irradiance had any effect upon the rate of respiration in warm-grown, cold-treated or cold-developed leaves. We conclude that changes in PSII redox poise, at least within the range experienced here, have no direct impacts on rates of leaf dark respiration, and that the respiratory cold acclimation response is unrelated to changes in chloroplast redox poise.
