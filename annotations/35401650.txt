Late blight, caused by <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> (<i>P. infestans</i>), is a devastating plant disease. <i>P. infestans</i> genome encodes hundreds of effectors, complicating the interaction between the pathogen and its host and making it difficult to understand the interaction mechanisms. In this study, the late blight-resistant potato cultivar Ziyun No.1 and the susceptible potato cultivar Favorita were infected with <i>P. infestans</i> isolate SCPZ16-3-1 to investigate the global expression profiles during the compatible and incompatible interactions using dual RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Most of the expressed Arg-X-Leu-Arg (RXLR) effector genes were suppressed during the first 24 h of infection, but upregulated after 24 h. Moreover, <i>P. infestans</i> induced more specifically expressed genes (SEGs), including RXLR effectors and cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs)-encoding genes, in the compatible interaction. The resistant potato activated a set of biotic stimulus responses and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis SEGs, including kirola-like protein, nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR), disease resistance, and kinase genes. Conversely, the susceptible potato cultivar upregulated more kinase, pathogenesis-related genes than the resistant cultivar. This study is the first study to characterize the compatible and incompatible interactions between <i>P. infestans</i> and different potato cultivars and provides the genome-wide expression profiles for RXLR effector, CWDEs, NBS-LRR protein, and kinase-encoding genes.
