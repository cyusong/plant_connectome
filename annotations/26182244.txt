['26182244', 'Meiotic chromosomes are organized into linear looped chromatin arrays by a  protein axis localized along the loop-bases. Programmed remodelling of the axis  occurs during prophase I of meiosis. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has  revealed dynamic changes in the chromosome axis in Arabidopsis thaliana and  Brassica oleracea. We show that the axis associated protein ASY1 is depleted  during zygotene concomitant with synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. Study of an  Atpch2 mutant demonstrates this requires the conserved AAA+ ATPase, PCH2, which  localizes to the sites of axis remodelling. Loss of PCH2 leads to a failure to  deplete ASY1 from the axes and compromizes SC polymerisation. Immunolocalization  of recombination proteins in Atpch2 indicates that recombination initiation and  CO designation during early prophase I occur normally. Evidence suggests that CO  interference is initially functional in the mutant but there is a defect in CO  maturation following designation. This leads to a reduction in COs and a failure  to form COs between some homologous chromosome pairs leading to univalent  chromosomes at metaphase I. Genetic analysis reveals that CO distribution is also  affected in some chromosome regions. Together these data indicate that the axis  remodelling defect in Atpch2 disrupts normal patterned formation of COs.', '2015 Jul', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1005372', 'Franklin']
