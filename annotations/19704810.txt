Long-term exposure of plants to saline soil results in mineral ion imbalance, altered metabolism and reduced growth. Currently, the interaction between ion content and plant metabolism under salt-stress is poorly understood. Here we present a multivariate correlation study on the metabolome, ionome and biomass changes of Lotus japonicus challenged by salt stress. Using latent variable models, we show that increasing salinity leads to reproducible changes of metabolite, ion and nutrient pools. Strong correlations between the metabolome and the ionome or biomass may allow one to estimate the degree of salt stress experienced by a plant based on metabolite profiles. Despite the apparently high predictive power of the models, it remains to be investigated whether such metabolite profiles of non- or moderately-stressed plants can be used by breeding programs as ideal ideotypes for the selection of enhanced salt-tolerant genotypes.
