Cucumber is one of the most commonly produced vegetable crops. The greatest economic losses in the yields of these crops have resulted from fungal infections-powdery mildew and downy mildew. The action of fungicides not only affects the fungi, but can also lead to metabolic disorders in plants. However, some fungicides have been reported to have positive physiological effects. Our research focused on the action of two commercially available fungicides, Scorpion 325 SC and Magnicur Finito 687,5 SC, on plant metabolism. Two approaches were used to check the effect of the fungicides at the early stage of plant development when metabolic changes occur most dynamically: spraying on the leaves of cucumber seedlings and presowing seed treatment. The application of the fungicide formulation as a presowing seed treatment caused perturbations in the phytase activity, leading to disorders in the energetic status of the germinating seeds. In addition, the tested preparations changed the morphology of the germinating seeds, limiting the growth of the stem. Furthermore, the application of the tested fungicides on seedlings also showed a disruption in the energetic status and in the antioxidative system. Therefore, the use of pesticides as agents causes a "green effect" and requires a much deeper understanding of plant metabolism.
