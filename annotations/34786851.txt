The development of a hook-like structure at the apical part of the soil-emerging organs has fascinated botanists for centuries, but how it is initiated remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate with high-throughput infrared imaging and 2-D clinostat treatment that, when gravity-induced root bending is absent, apical hook formation still takes place. In such scenarios, hook formation begins with a de novo growth asymmetry at the apical part of a straightly elongating hypocotyl. Remarkably, such de novo asymmetric growth, but not the following hook enlargement, precedes the establishment of a detectable auxin response asymmetry, and is largely independent of auxin biosynthesis, transport and signaling. Moreover, we found that functional cortical microtubule array is essential for the following enlargement of hook curvature. When microtubule array was disrupted by oryzalin, the polar localization of PIN proteins and the formation of an auxin maximum became impaired at the to-be-hook region. Taken together, we propose a more comprehensive model for apical hook initiation, in which the microtubule-dependent polar localization of PINs may mediate the instruction of growth asymmetry that is either stochastically taking place, induced by gravitropic response, or both, to generate a significant auxin gradient that drives the full development of the apical hook.

gravity-induced root bending: !initiates! apical hook formation 
de novo growth asymmetry: !precedes! auxin response asymmetry 
functional cortical microtubule array: !essential for! enlargement of hook curvature 
microtubule disruption: !impairs! polar localization of PIN proteins 
stochastic growth asymmetry: !generates! significant auxin gradient
