Plant nanobiology as a novel research field provides a scientific basis for the agricultural use of nanoparticles (NPs). Plants respond to the presence of nanomaterials by synthesizing signal molecules, such as the multifunctional gaseous nitric oxide (NO). Several reports have described the effects of different nanomaterials (primarily chitosan NPs, metal oxide NPs, and carbon nanotubes) on endogenous NO synthesis and signalling in different plant species. Other works have demonstrated the ameliorating effect of exogenous NO donor (primarily sodium nitroprusside) treatments on NP-induced stress. NO-releasing NPs are preferred alternatives to chemical NO donors, and evaluating their effects on plants has recently begun. Previous studies clearly indicate that endogenous NO production in the presence of nanomaterials or NO levels increased by exogenous treatments (NO-releasing NPs or chemical NO donors) exerts growth-promoting and stress-ameliorating effects in plants. Furthermore, an NP-based nanosensor for NO detection in plants has been developed, providing a new and excellent perspective for basic research and also for the evaluation of plants' health status in agriculture.
