Plant embryogenesis begins with an asymmetric division of the zygote, producing apical and basal cells with distinct cell fates. The asymmetric zygote division is thought to be critical for embryo pattern formation; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating this process, especially maintaining the accurate position and proper orientation of cell division plane, remain poorly understood. Here, we report that a dynamin-related protein in Nicotiana tabacum, NtDRP, plays a critical role in maintaining orientation of zygotic division plane. Down-regulation of NtDRP caused zygotic cell division to occur in different, incorrect orientations and resulted in disruption of suspensor formation, and even development of twin embryos. The basal cell lineage totally integrated with the apical cell lineage into an embryo-like structure, suggesting that NtDRP is essential to accurate zygotic division orientation and differentiation of basal cell lineage toward suspensor formation. We also reveal that NtDRP plays its role by modulating microtubule spatial organization and spindle orientation during early embryogenesis. Thus, we revealed that NtDRP is involved in orientation of the asymmetric zygotic division and differentiation of distinct suspensor and embryo domains, as well as subsequent embryo pattern formation.
