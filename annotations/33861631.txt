<i>Dickeya solani</i> is an emerging plant-pathogenic bacterium causing disease symptoms in a variety of agriculturally relevant crop species worldwide. To date, a number of <i>D. solani</i> genomes have been sequenced and characterized; the great majority of these genomes have, however, come from <i>D. solani</i> strains isolated from potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i> L.) and not from other plant hosts. Herewith, we present the first complete, high-quality genome of <i>D. solani</i> IPO 2019 (LMG 25990), isolated from the ornamental plant <i>Hyacinthus orientalis</i>. The genome of <i>D. solani</i> IPO 2019 consists of one chromosome of 4,919,542 bp, with a GC content of 56.2% and no plasmids. The genome contains 4,502 annotated features, 22 ribosomal RNA genes, 73 transfer RNA genes, and one CRISPR. We believe that the information on this high-quality, complete, closed genome of <i>D. solani</i> strain isolated from a host plant different from potato (i.e. hyacinth) will provide resources for comparative genomic studies and for analyses targeting adaptation and ecological fitness mechanisms present in <i>Dickeya solani</i> species.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
