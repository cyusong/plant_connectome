Amaranth has become increasingly popular due to its highly nutritious grains and ability to tolerate environmental stress. The mechanism underlying defense and adaptation to environmental stress is a complicated process involving DNA methylation and demethylation. These epigenetic features have been well documented to play an important role in plant stress response, including heavy metal-induced stress. This study was aimed at the identification and analysis of cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferase (<i>C5-MTase</i>) and demethylase (<i>DMTase</i>) genes in <i>Amaranthus cruentus</i>. Eight <i>C5-MTase</i> and two <i>DMTase</i> genes were identified and described in response to individual heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Zn, Mn) and their combination (Cd/Pb, Cd/Zn, Pb/Zn) in root and leaf tissues. Studied heavy metals, individually and in combinations, differentially regulated <i>C5-MTase</i> and <i>DMTase</i> gene expression. Interestingly, most of the genes were transcriptionally altered under Zn exposure. Our results suggest that identified amaranth <i>MTase</i> and <i>DMTase</i> genes are involved in heavy metal stress responses through regulating DNA methylation and demethylation level in amaranth plants.
