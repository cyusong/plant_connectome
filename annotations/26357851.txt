Light signaling plays a pivotal role in controlling plant morphogenesis, metabolism, growth and development. The central process of light signaling pathway is to build the link between light signals and the expression of genes involved. Although studies focused on light signaling toward metabolism have been documented well in the past several decades, most regulation networks of light signaling in a specific metabolic production largely remained unknown. Anthocyanin accumulation in plant tissues depends on the availability of light signals, but only little is known about the potential regulation network underlying light signal controls anthocyanin biosynthesis. Here, we briefly review the recent progress on the light-triggered anthocyanin biosynthesis via ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) network in Arabidopsis.
