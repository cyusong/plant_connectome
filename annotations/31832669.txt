Arabidopsis AtNRT1.1 (CHL1/AtNPF6.3) is the first nitrate transporter identified in plants and was initially found to play a role in nitrate uptake and transport. AtNRT1.1 also displays auxin transport activity and mediates nitrate-modulated root development, suggesting that it has transport capacity for multiple substrates. Subsequent work revealed that AtNRT1.1 can respond to environmental nitrate fluctuations by altering its nitrate transport activity, modulated by phosphorylation, leading to the critical finding that AtNRT1.1 acts as a transceptor for nitrate sensing. Recent studies have revealed how OsNRT1.1B, the functional homologue of AtNRT1.1 in rice, mediates nitrate signal transduction from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, and how OsNRT1.1B integrates the nitrate and phosphate signaling networks. OsNRT1.1B has also been shown to be involved in regulating the root microbiota to facilitate organic nitrogen mineralization in soil, thus mediating plant-microbe interactions. Furthermore, the divergent functions of OsNRT1.1A and OsNRT1.1B in regulating nitrogen use in rice suggest that the function of NRT1.1 is still far from fully understood. In this review, we focus on the most recent progress on the molecular mechanisms of NRT1.1s in plants, with the aim of providing an up-to-date view of the versatile functions of NRT1.1 in nitrogen utilization in plants.
