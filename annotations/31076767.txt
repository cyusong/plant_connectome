Karyogamy is a prerequisite event for plant embryogenesis, in which dynamic changes in nuclear architecture and the establishment of appropriate gene expression patterns must occur. However, the precise role of the male and female gametes in the progression of karyogamy still remains elusive. Here, we show that the sperm cell possesses the unique property to drive steady and swift nuclear fusion. When we fertilized egg cells with sperm cells in vitro, the immediate fusion of the male and female nuclei in the zygote progressed. This rapid nuclear fusion did not occur when two egg cells were artificially fused. However, the nuclear fusion of two egg nuclei could be accelerated by additional sperm entry or the exogenous application of calcium, suggesting that possible increase of cytosolic Ca2+ level via sperm entry into the egg cell efficiently can facilitate karyogamy. In contrast to zygotes, the egg-egg fusion cells failed to proliferate beyond an early developmental stage. Our transcriptional analyses also revealed the rapid activation of zygotic genes in zygotes, whereas there was no expression in fused cells without the male contribution. Thus, the male sperm cell has the ability to cause immediate karyogamy and to establish appropriate gene expression patterns in the zygote.
