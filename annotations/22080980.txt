Wheat kernel texture, a major trait determining the end-use quality of wheat flour, is mainly influenced by puroindolines. These small basic proteins display in vitro lipid binding and antimicrobial properties, but their cellular functions during grain development remain unknown. To gain an insight into their biological function, a comparative proteome analysis of two near-isogenic lines (NILs) of bread wheat Triticum aestivum L. cv. Falcon differing in the presence or absence of the puroindoline-a gene (Pina) and kernel hardness, was performed. Proteomes of the two NILs were compared at four developmental stages of the grain for the metabolic albumin/globulin fraction and the Triton-extracted amphiphilic fraction. Proteome variations showed that, during grain development, folding proteins and stress-related proteins were more abundant in the hard line compared with the soft one. These results, taken together with ultrastructural observations showing that the formation of the protein matrix occurred earlier in the hard line, suggested that a stress response, possibly the unfolded protein response, is induced earlier in the hard NIL than in the soft one leading to earlier endosperm cell death. Quantification of the albumin/globulin fraction and amphiphilic proteins at each developmental stage strengthened this hypothesis as a plateau was revealed from the 500 °Cd stage in the hard NIL whereas synthesis continued in the soft one. These results open new avenues concerning the function of puroindolines which could be involved in the storage protein folding machinery, consequently affecting the development of wheat endosperm and the formation of the protein matrix.
