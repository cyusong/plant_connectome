Light is essential to plant survival and elicits a wide range of plant developmental and physiological responses under different light conditions. A low red-to-far red (R/FR) light ratio induces shade-avoidance responses, including decreased anthocyanin accumulation, whereas a high R/FR light ratio promotes anthocyanin biosynthesis. However, the detailed molecular mechanism underpinning how different R/FR light ratios regulate anthocyanin homeostasis remains elusive, especially in non-model species. Here, we demonstrate that a low R/FR light ratio induced the expression of CmMYB4, which suppressed the anthocyanin activator complex CmMYB6-CmbHLH2, leading to the reduction of anthocyanin accumulation in Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium) petals. Specifically, CmMYB4 recruited the corepressor CmTPL (TOPLESS) to directly bind the CmbHLH2 promoter and suppressed its transcription by impairing histone H3 acetylation. Moreover, the low R/FR light ratio inhibited the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR family transcription factor CmbHLH16, which can competitively bind to CmMYB4 and destabilize the CmMYB4-CmTPL protein complex. Under the high R/FR light ratio, CmbHLH16 was upregulated, which impeded the formation of the CmMYB4-CmTPL complex and released the suppression of CmbHLH2, thus promoting anthocyanin accumulation in Chrysanthemum petals. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which different R/FR light ratios fine-tune anthocyanin homeostasis in flower petals.
