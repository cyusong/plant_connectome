Malate and citrate underpin the characteristic flexibility of central plant metabolism by linking mitochondrial respiratory metabolism with cytosolic biosynthetic pathways. However, the identity of mitochondrial carrier proteins that influence both processes has remained elusive. Here we show by a systems approach that DICARBOXYLATE CARRIER 2 (DIC2) facilitates mitochondrial malate-citrate exchange in vivo in Arabidopsis thaliana. DIC2 knockout (dic2-1) retards growth of vegetative tissues. In vitro and in organello analyses demonstrate that DIC2 preferentially imports malate against citrate export, which is consistent with altered malate and citrate utilization in response to prolonged darkness of dic2-1 plants or a sudden shift to darkness of dic2-1 leaves. Furthermore, isotopic glucose tracing reveals a reduced flux towards citrate in dic2-1, which results in a metabolic diversion towards amino acid synthesis. These observations reveal the physiological function of DIC2 in mediating the flow of malate and citrate between the mitochondrial matrix and other cell compartments.
