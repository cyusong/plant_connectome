['17889649', 'In plants, cell polarity and tissue patterning are connected by intercellular  flow of the phytohormone auxin, whose directional signaling depends on polar  subcellular localization of PIN auxin transport proteins. The mechanism of polar  targeting of PINs or other cargos in plants is largely unidentified, with the  PINOID kinase being the only known molecular component. Here, we identify PP2A  phosphatase as an important regulator of PIN apical-basal targeting and auxin  distribution. Genetic analysis, localization, and phosphorylation studies  demonstrate that PP2A and PINOID both partially colocalize with PINs and act  antagonistically on the phosphorylation state of their central hydrophilic loop,  hence mediating PIN apical-basal polar targeting. Thus, in plants, polar sorting  by the reversible phosphorylation of cargos allows for their conditional delivery  to specific intracellular destinations. In the case of PIN proteins, this  mechanism enables switches in the direction of intercellular auxin fluxes, which  mediate differential growth, tissue patterning, and organogenesis.', '2007 Sep 21', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.033', 'Friml']
