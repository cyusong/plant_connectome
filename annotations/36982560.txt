Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is an age-related disorder, which is one of the most prevalent and costly benign neoplasms in men with over 94 million cases worldwide. Starting before or around 50 years of age, there is a linear increase in prostate volume and BPH symptoms, which are influenced by changes in hormonal, inflammatory, growth factors, cell receptor signaling, diet, physical activity, and the microbiome of the prostate that leads to cellular proliferation. While current pharmaceutical or surgical treatments are currently available, each treatment has serious side effects. This dilemma has motived men to seek treatment without negative side effects from medicinal plants such as botanicals, phytochemicals, and vitamins that have established safety records. This narrative overview focuses on several botanicals, phytochemicals and vitamins that are widely used in the treatment of BPH and emphasizes how, in some cases, combinations of these natural ingredients may provide better BPH symptom relief compared to utilization of a single medicinal plant product (monotherapy). Finally, this overview highlights in vitro, in vivo animal studies and mainly clinical data of journal reports published in the past 5 years from January 2018 to January 2023 on BPH and nutraceuticals. Notably, there is an evolving perspective or rethinking of the role that medicinal phytochemicals and natural vitamins usage play; that is, they may hold promise or are likely to alleviate BPH symptoms.
