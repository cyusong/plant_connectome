['16679419', 'Phosphoprotein-binding domains are found in many different proteins and specify  protein-protein interactions critical for signal transduction pathways.  Forkhead-associated (FHA) domains bind phosphothreonine and control many aspects  of cell proliferation in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and animal cells. The  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein kinase-associated protein phosphatase  includes a FHA domain that mediates interactions with receptor-like kinases,  which in turn regulate a variety of signaling pathways involved in plant growth  and pathogen responses. Screens for insertional mutations in other Arabidopsis  FHA domain-containing genes identified a mutant with pleiotropic defects. dawdle  (ddl) plants are developmentally delayed, produce defective roots, shoots, and  flowers, and have reduced seed set. DDL is expressed in the root and shoot  meristems and the reduced size of the root apical meristem in ddl plants suggests  a role early in organ development.', '2006 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.076893', 'Walker']
