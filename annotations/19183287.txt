Dehydrins are hydrophilic proteins that accumulate during embryogenesis and osmotic stress responses in plants. Here, we report an interaction between citrus dehydrin Citrus unshiu cold-regulated 15 kDa protein (CuCOR15) and DNA. Binding of CuCOR15 to DNA was detected by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a filter-binding assay and Southwestern blotting. The binding was stimulated by physiological concentrations of Zn2+, but little stimulation occurred when other divalent cations, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+, were substituted for Zn2+. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid cancelled the Zn2+-stimulated binding. A binding curve and competitor experiments suggested that the DNA binding of CuCOR15 exhibited low affinity and non-specificity. Moreover, tRNA competed with the DNA binding. Histidine-rich domains and a polylysine segment-containing domain participated in the DNA binding. These results suggest that CuCOR15 can interact with DNA, and also RNA, in the presence of Zn2+. Dehydrin may protect nucleic acids in plant cells during seed maturation and stress responses.
