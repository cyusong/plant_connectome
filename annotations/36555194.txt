The plant cytoskeleton, consisting of actin filaments and microtubules, is a highly dynamic filamentous framework involved in plant growth, development, and stress responses. Recently, research has demonstrated that the plant cytoskeleton undergoes rapid remodeling upon sensing pathogen attacks, coordinating the formation of microdomain immune complexes, the dynamic and turnover of pattern-recognizing receptors (PRRs), the movement and aggregation of organelles, and the transportation of defense compounds, thus serving as an important platform for responding to pathogen infections. Meanwhile, pathogens produce effectors targeting the cytoskeleton to achieve pathogenicity. Recent findings have uncovered several cytoskeleton-associated proteins mediating cytoskeletal remodeling and defense signaling. Furthermore, the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is revealed to further feedback-regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and trigger salicylic acid (SA) signaling, suggesting an extremely complex role of the cytoskeleton in plant immunity. Here, we describe recent advances in understanding the host cytoskeleton dynamics upon sensing pathogens and summarize the effectors that target the cytoskeleton. We highlight advances in the regulation of cytoskeletal remodeling associated with the defense response and assess the important function of the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton in the immune response. Finally, we propose suggestions for future research in this area.
