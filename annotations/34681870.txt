The elongation and development of wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) stem play an important role in plant architecture. The shortened stem would result in a sheathed spike and a low yield in crops. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying a sheathed spike would be beneficial for plant architecture and yield improvement. We identified a novel gene, <i>TaWUS-like</i> (<i>WUSCHEL</i>-<i>related homeobox</i>-<i>like</i>), which regulated sheathed spike and plant architecture in wheat. The plant height of overexpression transgenic lines was significantly decreased and the spike was not completely elongated and enclosed in flag leaf sheaths. Moreover, the increase in tiller angle resulted in loose plant architecture and lower yield. The statistical and cytological analysis demonstrated that the length of the uppermost and secondary internode was significantly shortened, especially the uppermost internode which was only half the length of the wild-type. The size of parenchyma cells was obviously reduced and cell length on the longitudinal section was elongated insufficiently compared with wild-type. The analysis of hormone content showed that there was a lack of gibberellin A 3 (GA<sub>3</sub>) in internodes but a higher brassinosteroid (BR) content. <i>TaWUS-like</i> may inhibit the synthesis of GA<sub>3</sub> and/or BR, thus affecting the function of signal transduction of these hormones, which further caused stem shortening and plant dwarfing in wheat.
