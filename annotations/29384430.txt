Management of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can be implemented to deal with sustainable intensification of agriculture. Ethylene is an essential component for plant growth and development and in response to drought. However, little is known about the effects of bacterial inoculation on ethylene transduction pathway. Thus, the present study sought to establish whether ethylene perception is critical for growth induction by two different PGPB strains under drought conditions and the analysis of bacterial effects on ethylene production and gene expression in tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum). The ethylene-insensitive never ripe (nr) and its isogenic wild-type (wt) cv. Pearson line were inoculated with either Bacillus megaterium or Enterobacter sp. strain C7 and grown until the attainment of maturity under both well-watered and drought conditions. Ethylene perception is crucial for B. megaterium. However, it is not of prime importance for Enterobacter sp. strain C7 PGPB activity under drought conditions. Both PGPB decreased the expression of ethylene-related genes in wt plants, resulting in stress alleviation, while only B. megaterium induced their expression in nr plants. Furthermore, PGPB inoculation affected transcriptomic profile dependency on strain, genotype, and drought. Ethylene sensitivity determines plant interaction with PGPB strains. Enterobacter sp. strain C7 could modulate amino-acid metabolism, while nr mutation causes a partially functional interaction with B. megaterium, resulting in higher oxidative stress and loss of PGPB activity.
