The whitefly-transmitted tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is one of the most destructive viral pathogens of cultivated tomato. To combat TYLCV, resistance gene <i>Ty-2</i> has been introduced into cultivated tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) from wild tomato species <i>Solanum habrochaites</i> by interspecific crossing. Introgression lines with <i>Ty-2</i> contain a large inversion compared with <i>S. lycopersicum</i>, which causes severe suppression of recombination and has hampered the cloning of <i>Ty-2</i> so far. Here, we report the fine-mapping and cloning of <i>Ty-2</i> using crosses between a <i>Ty-2</i> introgression line and several susceptible <i>S. habrochaites</i> accessions. <i>Ty-2</i> was shown to encode a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein. For breeding purposes, a highly specific DNA marker tightly linked to the <i>Ty-2</i> gene was developed permitting marker-assisted selection. The resistance mediated by <i>Ty-2</i> was effective against the Israel strain of TYLCV (TYLCV-IL) and tomato yellow leaf curl virus-[China : Shanghai2] (TYLCV-[CN : SH2]), but not against tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) and leafhopper-transmitted beet curly top virus (BCTV). By co-infiltration experiments we showed that transient expression of the Rep/C1 protein of TYLCV, but not of TYLCSV triggered a hypersensitive response (HR) in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> plants co-expressing the <i>Ty-2</i> gene. Our results indicate that the <i>Rep</i>/<i>C1</i> gene of TYLCV-IL presents the avirulence determinant of <i>Ty-2-</i>mediated resistance.
