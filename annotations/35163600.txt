YABs play an important role in the leaf development of the paper mulberry (<i>Broussonetia papyrifera</i>) and of the heterophylly. Thus, we investigated the function of BpYABs. Gene cloning, phylogenetic analysis, motif identification, subcellular localization, transactivation activity assay, qRT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and ectopic expression were used in our study. Six <i>BpYAB</i>s were isolated, and four of them had transcriptional activity. BpYAB1, BpYAB3, BpYAB4, and BpYAB5 were localized to the nucleus. <i>BpYAB1</i> was only expressed in the flower, while <i>BpYAB6</i> was not expressed in any detected tissues; the four remaining <i>BpYAB</i>s were expressed in the bud, leaf and flower, and their expression level decreased with leaf development. Further in situ hybridization showed that <i>BpYAB3</i> and <i>BpYAB5</i> were expressed in the vascular tissues and lamina, but neither showed the adaxial-abaxial polarity distribution pattern in the mature leaf lamina. Ectopic expression of <i>BpYAB2</i>, <i>BpYAB3</i>, <i>BpYAB4</i> and <i>BpYAB5</i> induced increased expression of <i>AtWOX1</i> and caused the leaf of Arabidopsis to become smaller and curl downwards. Ectopic expression also led to shorter siliques and smaller seeds, but not for <i>BpYAB5</i>. These results suggest that BpYABs have functional divergency and redundancy in regulating leaf and silique development.
