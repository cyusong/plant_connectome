Most land plants can form symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to enhance uptake of mineral nutrients, particularly phosphate (Pi) and nitrogen (N), from the soil. It is established that transport of Pi from interfacial apoplast into plant cells depends on the H<sup>+</sup> gradient generated by the H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase located on the periarbuscular membrane (PAM); however, little evidence regarding the potential link between mycorrhizal N transport and H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase activity is available to date. Here, we report that a PAM-localized tomato H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase, SlHA8, is indispensable for arbuscule development and mycorrhizal P and N uptake. Knockout of SlHA8 resulted in truncated arbuscule morphology, reduced shoot P and N accumulation, and decreased H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase activity and acidification of apoplastic spaces in arbusculated cells. Overexpression of SlHA8 in tomato promoted both P and N uptake, and increased total colonization level, but did not affect arbuscule morphology. Heterogeneous expression of SlHA8 in the rice osha1 mutant could fully complement its defects in arbuscule development and mycorrhizal P and N uptake. Our results propose a pivotal role of the SlHA8 in energizing both the symbiotic P and N transport, and highlight the evolutionary conservation of the AM-specific H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase orthologs in maintaining AM symbiosis across different mycorrhizal plant species.
