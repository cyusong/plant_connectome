Anthocyanins contribute to coloration and antioxidation effects in different plant tissues. MYB transcription factors have been demonstrated to be a key regulator for anthocyanin synthesis in many plants. However, little information was available about the MYB genes in the halophyte species Eutrema salsugineum. Here we report the identification of an important anthocyanin biosynthesis regulator EsMYB90 from Eutrema salsugineum, which is a halophyte tolerant to multiple abiotic stresses. Our phylogenetic and localization analyses supported that EsMYB90 is an R2R3 type of MYB transcription factor. Ectopic expression of EsMYB90 in tobacco and Arabidopsis enhanced pigmentation and anthocyanin accumulation in various organs. The transcriptome analysis revealed that 42 genes upregulated by EsMYB90 in 35S:EsMYB90 tobacco transgenic plants are required for anthocyanin biosynthesis. Moreover, our qRT-PCR results showed that EsMYB90 promoted expression of early (PAL, CHS, and CHI) and late (DFR, ANS, and UFGT) anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in stems, leaves, and flowers of 35S:EsMYB90 tobacco transgenic plants. Our results indicated that EsMYB90 is a MYB transcription factor, which regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis genes to control anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our work provides a new tool to enhance anthocyanin production in various plants.
