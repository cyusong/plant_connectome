Legume and rhizobium species can establish a nitrogen-fixing nodule symbiosis. Previous studies have shown that several transcription factors that play a role in (lateral) root development are also involved in nodule development. Chromatin remodeling factors, like transcription factors, are key players in regulating gene expression. However, studies have not investigated whether chromatin remodeling genes that are essential for root development are also involved in nodule development. Here, we studied the role of Medicago (Medicago truncatula) histone deacetylases (MtHDTs) in nodule development. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) orthologs of HDTs have been shown to play a role in root development. MtHDT expression is induced in nodule primordia and is maintained in the nodule meristem and infection zone. Conditional, nodule-specific knockdown of MtHDT expression by RNAi blocks nodule primordium development. A few nodules may still form, but their nodule meristems are smaller, and rhizobial colonization of the cells derived from the meristem is markedly reduced. Although the HDTs are expressed during nodule and root development, transcriptome analyses indicate that HDTs control the development of each organ in a different manner. During nodule development, the MtHDTs positively regulate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase 1 (MtHMGR1). Decreased expression of MtHMGR1 is sufficient to explain the inhibition of primordium formation.
