['20427464', 'Phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPK) is an enzyme involved in the  regulation of cellular levels of phosphoinositides involved in various  physiological processes, such as cytoskeletal organization, ion channel  activation, and vesicle trafficking. In animals, research has focused on the  modes of activation and function of PIPKs, providing an understanding of the  importance of plasma membrane localization. However, it still remains unclear how  this issue is regulated in plant PIPKs. Here, we demonstrate that the  carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain, which contains the activation loop, is  sufficient for plasma membrane localization of PpPIPK1, a type I/II B PIPK from  the moss Physcomitrella patens. The importance of the carboxyl-terminal catalytic  domain for plasma membrane localization was confirmed with Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtPIP5K1. Our findings, in which substitution of a  conserved dibasic amino acid pair in the activation loop of PpPIPK1 completely  prevented plasma membrane targeting and abolished enzymatic activity, demonstrate  its critical role in these processes. Placing our results in the context of  studies of eukaryotic PIPKs led us to conclude that the function of the dibasic  amino acid pair in the activation loop in type I/II PIPKs is plant specific.', '2010 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.152686', 'Sommarin']
