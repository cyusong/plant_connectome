The isolated protoplasts of rose flowers were used to investigate the metabolic pathway in rose flower leading from shikimic acid or L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) to 2-phenylethanol (2PE), a dominant volatile compound in hybrid roses such as Rosa damascena Mill., R. 'Hoh-Jun', and R. 'Yves Piaget'. Deuterium-labeled L-Phe ([2H8]L-Phe) was supplied to the protoplasts isolated from R. 'Yves Piaget' petals. The volatile end products ([2Hn]-2PE, n=6-8) and their related intermediates ([2Hn]phenylacetaldehyde, n=6-8) were detected in the protoplasts by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition, we chemically synthesized [2,3,4,5,6-13C5]shikimic acid, a new stable isotopomer, to investigate the formation of 2PE from shikimic acid by GC-MS and nuclear magnetic resonance. We proposed the hypothetical biochemical pathway of 2PE from shikimic acid via chorismic acid, L-Phe, and phenylacetaldehyde. This protoplast system facilitates findings of metabolic intermediates and simplifies the complex branching biosynthetic pathways of floral scents to distinct individual events.
