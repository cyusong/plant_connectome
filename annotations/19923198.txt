Tropospheric ozone concentration is increasing and represents a threat to single plants and whole ecosystems. The deleterious ozone effects mainly occur when (i) ozone concentration in the air builds up; (ii) the pollutant enters the leaf through stomatal uptake, and (iii) ozone-produced reactive oxygen species are not efficiently scavenged by leaf antioxidants and then oxidize leaf tissues. The sensitivity of plants to ozone is species-specific, and a correct risk assessment should be based on a metric that correctly takes into account the ambient concentration of ozone, the physiological control on stomatal apertures, and the efficiency of leaf antioxidant system. Current methodologies have been analysed to evaluate ozone risk assessment, and, by phasing-in and phasing out sources and sinks of ozone, elements of improvements for the current metrics have been suggested.

Ozone: !increases! Tropospheric concentration 
Stomata: !uptake! Ozone 
Reactive oxygen species: !scavenged by! Leaf antioxidants 
Plants: !sensitive to! Ozone 
Metric: !takes into account! Ambient ozone concentration 
Metric: !takes into account! Physiological control on stomatal apertures 
Metric: !takes into account! Efficiency of leaf antioxidant system
