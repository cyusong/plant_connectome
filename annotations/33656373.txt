<i>Venturia carpophila</i>, the causal agent of scab disease on peach, is a host-specific fungus that is widely distributed around the world, including China. In our previous study, samples were collected from 14 provinces in China, and 750 isolates were obtained by single-spore separation. Here, we reported the first highly contiguous whole-genome sequence (35.87 Mb) of the <i>V. carpophila</i> isolate ZJHZ1-1-1, which included 33 contigs with N<sub>50</sub> value of 2.01 Mb and maximum contig length of 3.39 Mb. The high-quality genome sequence and annotation resource will be useful to study the fungal biology, pathogen-host interaction, fungicide resistance, characterization of important genes, population genetic diversity, and development of molecular markers for genotyping and species identification.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
