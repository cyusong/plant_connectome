The AP1/FUL transcription factors are important for floral development, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we cloned and identified two AP1/FUL-like genes, GhAP1.1 and GhFUL2, in upland cotton, which is a commonly cultivated economically valuable crop. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis indicated that GhAP1.1 and GhFUL2, which are encoded by genes in the AP1/FUL clade, have conserved N-terminal regions but diverse C-terminal domains. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that GhAP1.1 and GhFUL2 were expressed in the flower and root, and showed opposite expression patterns during shoot apical meristem development. The upregulated expression of GhAP1.1 in Arabidopsis did not result in significant changes to the flowering time or floral organ development, and the transcript levels of the florigen FT increased and those of LFY decreased. Overexpression of GhFUL2 in Arabidopsis delayed flowering and promoted bolting by decreasing FT and LFY transcript levels. Silencing GhFUL2 in cotton dramatically increased the expression of GhFT and GhAP1.3 and promoted flowering. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays indicated that GhAP1.1 could interact with the SVP homolog GhSVP2.2, whereas GhFUL2 formed heterodimers with GhSEP3/GhSEP4 homologs and GhSVP2.2. The present results demonstrated that the functional divergence of GhAP1.1 and GhFUL2, which involved changes in sequences and expression patterns, influenced the regulation of cotton flower development.
