Accumulation of soluble proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of plants is mediated by a receptor termed ER RETENTION DEFECTIVE2 (ERD2) or K/HDEL receptor. Using two gain-of-function assays and by complementing loss of function in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, we discovered that compromising the lumenal N terminus or the cytosolic C terminus with fluorescent fusions abolishes its biological function and profoundly affects its subcellular localization. Based on the confirmed asymmetrical topology of ERD2, we engineered a new fluorescent ERD2 fusion protein that retains biological activity. Using this fusion, we show that ERD2 is exclusively detected at the Golgi apparatus, unlike nonfunctional C-terminal fusions, which also label the ER. Moreover, ERD2 is confined to early Golgi compartments and does not show ligand-induced redistribution to the ER. We show that the cytosolic C terminus of ERD2 plays a crucial role in its function. Two conserved leucine residues that do not correspond to any known targeting motifs for ER-Golgi trafficking were shown to be essential for both ERD2 Golgi residency and its ability to mediate ER retention of soluble ligands. The results suggest that anterograde ER to Golgi transport of ERD2 is either extremely fast, well in excess of the bulk flow rate, or that ERD2 does not recycle in the way originally proposed.
