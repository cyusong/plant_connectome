Endophytic fungi from desert plants belong to a unique microbial community that has been scarcely investigated chemically and could be a new resource for bioactive natural products. In this study, 13 secondary metabolites (<b>1-13</b>) with diverse carbon skeletons, including a novel polyketide (1) with a unique 5,6-dihydro-4<i>H</i>,7<i>H</i>-2,6-methanopyrano[4,3-<i>d</i>][1,3]dioxocin-7-one ring system and three undescribed polyketides (<b>2</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>11</b>), were obtained from the endophytic fungus <i>Neocamarosporium betae</i> isolated from two desert plant species. Different approaches, including HR-ESI-MS, UV spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, NMR, and CD, were used to determine the planar and absolute configurations of the compounds. The possible biosynthetic pathways were proposed based on the structural characteristics of compounds <b>1-13</b>. Compounds <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>9</b> exhibited strong cytotoxicity toward HepG2 cells compared with the positive control. Several metabolites (<b>2</b>, <b>4-5</b>, <b>7-9</b>, and <b>11-13</b>) were phytotoxic to foxtail leaves. The results support the hypothesis that endophytic fungi from special environments, such as desert areas, produce novel bioactive secondary metabolites.
