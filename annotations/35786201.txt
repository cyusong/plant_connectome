Because of global warming, the apple flowering period is occurring significantly earlier, increasing the probability and degree of freezing injury. Moreover, extreme hot weather has also seriously affected the development of apple industry. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are main channels controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport, but their roles in regulating plant development and stress responses are still unknown. Here, we analysed the components of the apple NPC and found that MdNup62 interacts with MdNup54, forming the central NPC channel. MdNup62 was localized to the nuclear pore, and its expression was significantly up-regulated in 'Nagafu No. 2' tissue-cultured seedlings subjected to heat treatments. To determine MdNup62's function, we obtained MdNup62-overexpressed (OE) Arabidopsis and tomato lines that showed significantly reduced high-temperature resistance. Additionally, OE-MdNup62 Arabidopsis lines showed significantly earlier flowering compared with wild-type. Furthermore, we identified 62 putative MdNup62-interacting proteins and confirmed MdNup62 interactions with multiple MdHSFs. The OE-MdHSFA1d and OE-MdHSFA9b Arabidopsis lines also showed significantly earlier flowering phenotypes than wild-type, but had enhanced high-temperature resistance levels. Thus, MdNUP62 interacts with multiple MdHSFs during nucleocytoplasmic transport to regulate flowering and heat resistance in apple. The data provide a new theoretical reference for managing the impact of global warming on the apple industry.
