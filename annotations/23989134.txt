Species of the epiphytic fungus Pseudozyma are not pathogenic to plants and can be used as biocontrol agents against plant pathogens. Deciphering how they induce plant defense might contribute to their use for plant protection and expand our understanding of molecular plant-pathogen interactions. Here we show that Pseudozyma aphidis isolate L12, which is known to induce jasmonic acid- and salicylic acid-independent systemic resistance, can also activate local and systemic resistance in an ethylene-independent manner. We also show that P. aphidis localizes exclusively to the surface of the plant leaf and does not penetrate the mesophyll cells of treated leaves. We thus propose that P. aphidis acts via several mechanisms, and is an excellent candidate biocontrol agent.

P. aphidis: !localizes to! plant leaf surface 
P. aphidis: !induces! jasmonic acid- and salicylic acid-independent systemic resistance 
P. aphidis: !induces! ethylene-independent local and systemic resistance 
P. aphidis: !acts via! several mechanisms
