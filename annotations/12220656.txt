['12220656', 'The Arabidopsis genome contains four genes that encode proteins similar to both  spermidine synthase and spermine synthase of other organisms. Our previous study  revealed that one of these genes, designated ACAULIS5 (ACL5), encodes spermine  synthase and that its null mutation results in a severe defect in the elongation  of stem internodes. Here we report the characterization of the other three genes,  designated SPDS1, SPDS2 and SPDS3. Our results showed that SPDS1 and SPDS2  possess spermidine synthase activity in yeast spermidine synthase-deficient  mutants, but the enzyme activity of SPDS3 remained to be determined. RNA gel blot  analysis revealed that all of these genes are expressed in all plant organs but  show different responses to exogenous plant hormones, suggesting that they are  involved in different aspects of growth by modulating the contents of polyamines  in plant cells.', '2002 Sep 11', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03217-9', 'Takahashi']
