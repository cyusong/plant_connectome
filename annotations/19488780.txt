Pisum sativum L., the garden pea crop plant, is serving as the unique model for genetic analyses of morphogenetic development of stipule, the lateral organ formed on either side of the junction of leafblade petiole and stem at nodes. The stipule reduced (st) and cochleata (coch) stipule mutations and afila (af), tendril-less (tl), multifoliate-pinna (mfp) and unifoliata-tendrilled acacia (uni-tac) leafblade mutations were variously combined and the recombinant genotypes were quantitatively phenotyped for stipule morphology at both vegetative and reproductive nodes. The observations suggest a role of master regulator to COCH in stipule development. COCH is essential for initiation, growth and development of stipule, represses the UNI-TAC, AF, TL and MFP led leafblade-like morphogenetic pathway for compound stipule and together with ST mediates the developmental pathway for peltate-shaped simple wild-type stipule. It is also shown that stipule is an autonomous lateral organ, like a leafblade and secondary inflorescence.
