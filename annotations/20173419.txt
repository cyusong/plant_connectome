We reported recently that internalization of the plant blue light receptor phototropin 1 (phot1) from the plasma membrane in response to irradiation is reliant on receptor autophosphorylation. Pharmacological interference and co-immunoprecipitation analyses also indicated that light-induced internalization of phot1 involves clathrin-dependent processes. Here, we describe additional pharmacological studies that impact the subcellular localization and trafficking of Arabidopsis phot1. Alterations in the microtububle cytoskeleton led to dramatic differences in phot1 localization and function. Likewise, inhibition of phosphatidic acid (PA) signaling was found to impair phot1 localization and function. However, action of PA inhibition on phot1 function may be attributed to pleiotropic effects on cell growth. While phot1 kinase activation is necessary to stimulate its internalization, autophosphorylation is not required for phot1 turnover in response to prolonged blue light irradiation. The implications of these findings in regard to phot1 localization and function are discussed.
