['21481027', 'DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose one of the most severe threats to genome  integrity, potentially leading to cell death. After detection of a DSB, the DNA  damage and repair response is initiated and the DSB is repaired by non-homologous  end joining and/or homologous recombination. Many components of these processes  are still unknown in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this work, we characterized  gamma-irradiation and mitomycin C induced 1 (GMI1), a member of the SMC-hinge  domain-containing protein family. RT-PCR analysis and promoter-GUS fusion studies  showed that gamma-irradiation, the radio-mimetic drug bleocin, and the DNA  cross-linking agent mitomycin C strongly enhance GMI1 expression particularly in  meristematic tissues. The induction of GMI1 by gamma-irradiation depends on the  signalling kinase Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) but not on ATM and  Rad3-related (ATR). Epistasis analysis of single and double mutants demonstrated  that ATM acts upstream of GMI1 while the atr gmi1-2 double mutant was more  sensitive than the respective single mutants. Comet assay revealed a reduced rate  of DNA double-strand break repair in gmi1 mutants during the early recovery phase  after exposure to bleocin. Moreover, the rate of homologous recombination of a  reporter construct was strongly reduced in gmi1 mutant plants upon exposure to  bleocin or mitomycin C. GMI1 is the first member of its protein family known to  be involved in DNA repair.', '2011 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04604.x', 'Schweizer']
