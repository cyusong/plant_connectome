ATBS1-INTERACTING FACTOR 2 (AIF2) is a non-DNA-binding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor. We demonstrated that AIF2 retards dark-triggered and brassinosteroid (BR)-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana. Dark-triggered BR synthesis and the subsequent activation of BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1), a BR signaling positive regulator, result in BZR1 binding to the AIF2 promoter in a dark-dependent manner, reducing AIF2 transcript levels and accelerating senescence. BR-induced down-regulation of AIF2 protein stability partly contributes to the progression of dark-induced leaf senescence. Furthermore, AIF2 interacts with INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1) via their C-termini. Formation of the AIF2-ICE1 complex and subsequent up-regulation of C-REPEAT BINDING FACTORs (CBFs) negatively regulates dark-triggered, BR-induced leaf senescence. This involves antagonistic down-regulation of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), modulated through AIF2-dependent inhibition of ICE1's binding to the promoter. PIF4-dependent activities respond to dark-induced early senescence and may promote BR synthesis and BZR1 activation to suppress AIF2 and accelerate dark-induced senescence. Taken together, these findings suggest a coordination of AIF2 and ICE1 functions in maintaining stay-green traits.
