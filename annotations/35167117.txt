Tea trichomes synthesize numerous specialized metabolites to protect plants from environmental stresses and contribute to tea flavours, but little is known about the regulation of trichome development. Here, we showed that CsMYB1 is involved in the regulation of trichome formation and galloylated cis-catechins biosynthesis in tea plants. The variations in CsMYB1 expression levels are closely correlated with trichome indexes and galloylated cis-catechins contents in tea plant populations. Genome resequencing showed that CsMYB1 may be selected in modern tea cultivars, since a 192-bp insertion in CsMYB1 promoter was found exclusively in modern tea cultivars but not in the glabrous wild tea Camellia taliensis. Several enhancers in the 192-bp insertion increased CsMYB1 transcription in modern tea cultivars that coincided with their higher galloylated cis-catechins contents and trichome indexes. Biochemical analyses and transgenic data showed that CsMYB1 interacted with CsGL3 and CsWD40 and formed a MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) transcriptional complex to activate the trichome regulator genes CsGL2 and CsCPC, and the galloylated cis-catechins biosynthesis genes anthocyanidin reductase and serine carboxypeptidase-like 1A. CsMYB1 integratively regulated trichome formation and galloylated cis-catechins biosynthesis. Results suggest that CsMYB1, trichome and galloylated cis-catechins are coincidently selected during tea domestication by harsh environments for improved adaption and by breeders for better tea flavours.
