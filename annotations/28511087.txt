Low levels of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) are demonstrated in two species with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, Portulaca cyclophylla and P. digyna. The expression of CAM in P. cyclophylla and P. digyna is facultative, i.e. optional. Well-watered plants did not accumulate acid at night and exhibited gas-exchange patterns consistent with C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. CAM-type nocturnal acidification was reversible in that it was induced following drought and lost when droughted plants were rewatered. In P. cyclophylla, droughting was accompanied by a small but discernible net uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> during the dark, whereas in P. digyna, net CO<sub>2</sub> exchange at night approached the CO<sub>2</sub> compensation point but did not transition beyond it. This report brings the number of known C<sub>4</sub> species with a capacity for expressing CAM to six. All are species of Portulaca. The observation of CAM in P. cyclophylla and P. digyna is the first for species in the opposite-leaved (OL) Portulacelloid-anatomy lineage of Portulaca and for the Australian clade therein. The other four species are within the alternate-leaved (AL) lineage, in the Atriploid-anatomy Oleracea and the Pilosoid-anatomy Pilosa clades. Studies of the evolutionary origins of C<sub>4</sub> and CAM in Portulaca will benefit from a more wide-range survey of CAM across its species, particularly in the C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate-containing Cryptopetala clade.
