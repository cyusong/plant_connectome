The influence of zinc (Zn) on physiological and biochemical parameters was studied to elucidate the mechanism of Zn resistance in Phragmites australis. Zn concentrations in roots, stems and leaves increased with exogenous Zn concentration, while Zn content in roots was much higher than in shoots. X-ray microanalysis was used to reveal compartments in which Zn accumulated in root cortex. Zinc concentrations followed a gradient with the sequence: intercellular space>cell wall >vacuole >cytoplasm, indicating that most Zn was immobilized in the apoplast or sequestered into the vacuolar lumen. Sequential extraction of various Zn chelates revealed that the ratio of Zn extracted with different extraction media was markedly different. Ethanol, HAc (acetic acid) and NaCl-extractable Zn were dominant in both roots and leaves of P. australis. Zn-binding protein fractions were found in the roots and leaves after gel filtration chromatography, among which a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa bound Zn most effectively. Two newly synthesized polypeptides of 58 and 45 kDa appeared under Zn pollution, whereas a prominent fraction of 72 kDa disappeared. The involvement of Zn distribution in plant tissues, subcellular compartments and chelates and Zn-inducing proteins in the acclimation mechanism of P. australis to Zn pollution is discussed.
