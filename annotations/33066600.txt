Awns, which are either bristles or hair-like outgrowths of lemmas in the florets, are one of the typical morphological characteristics of grass species. These stiff structures contribute to grain dispersal and burial and fend off animal predators. However, their phenotypic and genetic associations with traits deciding potential yield and quality are not fully understood. Awns appear to improve photosynthesis, provide assimilates for grain filling, thus contributing to the final grain yield, especially under temperature- and water-stress conditions. Long awns, however, represent a competing sink with developing kernels for photosynthates, which can reduce grain yield under favorable conditions. In addition, long awns can hamper postharvest handling, storage, and processing activities. Overall, little is known about the elusive role of awns, thus, this review summarizes what is known about the effect of awns on grain yield and biomass yield, grain nutritional value, and forage-quality attributes. The influence of awns on the agronomic performance of grasses seems to be associated with environmental and genetic factors and varies in different stages of plant development. The contribution of awns to yield traits and quality features previously documented in major cereal crops, such as rice, barley, and wheat, emphasizes that awns can be targeted for yield and quality improvement and may advance research aimed at identifying the phenotypic effects of morphological traits in grasses.
