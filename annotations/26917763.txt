['26917763', 'The SPO11 protein catalyzes the formation of meiotic DNA double strand breaks  (DSBs) and is homologous to the A subunit of an archaeal topoisomerase (topo VI).  Topo VI are heterotetrameric enzymes comprising two A and two B subunits;  however, no topo VIB involved in meiotic recombination had been identified. We  characterized a structural homolog of the archaeal topo VIB subunit [meiotic  topoisomerase VIB-like (MTOPVIB)], which is essential for meiotic DSB formation.  It forms a complex with the two Arabidopsis thaliana SPO11 orthologs required for  meiotic DSB formation (SPO11-1 and SPO11-2) and is absolutely required for the  formation of the SPO11-1/SPO11-2 heterodimer. These findings suggest that the  catalytic core complex responsible for meiotic DSB formation in eukaryotes adopts  a topo VI-like structure.', '2016 Feb 26', 'Science', '10.1126/science.aad5196', 'Grelon']
