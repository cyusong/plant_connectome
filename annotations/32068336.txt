A recent paper by Kidokoro et al. (2020) in The Plant Cell reported a transgene-dependent transcriptional silencing phenomenon in the dominant ice1-1 Arabidopsis mutant containing the CBF3-LUC reporter, and questioned whether ICE1 may regulate CBF genes and may be involved in plant cold response. Here, we evaluate available evidence supporting the involvement of ICE1 in plant cold response, and provide ChIP-seq data showing ICE1 binding to the promoters of CBF genes and other regulatory genes known to be critical for cold response as well as to the promoters of some COR genes.

ICE1: !binds to! promoters of CBF genes
ICE1: !binds to! promoters of other regulatory genes
ICE1: !binds to! promoters of COR genes
ICE1: !regulates! CBF genes
ICE1: !involved in! plant cold response
