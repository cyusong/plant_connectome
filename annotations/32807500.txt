['32807500', 'Plant innate immunity varies with age and plant developmental stages. Recently,  we reported that Arabidopsis thaliana microRNA miR172b regulates FLS2  transcription through two transcription factors: TARGET OF EAT1 (TOE1) and TOE2.  Although the flg22-triggered immune responses were investigated in 2-d-old or  even younger toe1/toe2 mutant and miR172b over expression (OE) transgenic plants,  the FLS2-mediated immune responses in older plants remain uncharacterized yet. In  this work, we analyzed the flg22-triggered immune response in 6-d-old toe1/toe2  and miR172b OE plants. We found that unlike 2-d-old plants, 6-d-old Col-0,  toe1/toe2 and miR172b OE plants exhibit comparable flg22-triggered immune  responses. Strikingly, miR172b precursor in 6-d-old Col-0 plants upon flg22  treatment reached to a very high level, consequently, the TOE1/2 protein level  under this condition was very low or almost undetectable, which explains why  6-d-old WT seedlings are very similar to toe1/toe2 seedlings or miR172b OE plants  with respect to the flg22-triggered immune responses. Taken together, our study  reveals that miR172b-TOE1/2 module regulates plant innate immunity in an  age-dependent manner.', '2020 Oct 22', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.07.061', 'Lu']
