We have recently found that microbial species ranging from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria to different fungi emit volatiles that strongly promote starch accumulation in leaves of both mono- and di-cotyledonous plants. Transcriptome and enzyme activity analyses of potato leaves exposed to volatiles emitted by Alternaria alternata revealed that starch over-accumulation was accompanied by enhanced 3-phosphoglycerate to Pi ratio, and changes in functions involved in both central carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Exposure to microbial volatiles also promoted changes in the expression of genes that code for enzymes involved in endocytic uptake and traffic of solutes. With the overall data we propose a metabolic model wherein important determinants of accumulation of exceptionally high levels of starch include (a) upregulation of ADPglucose-producing SuSy, starch synthase III and IV, proteins involved in the endocytic uptake and traffic of sucrose, (b) down-regulation of acid invertase, starch breakdown enzymes and proteins involved in internal amino acid provision, and (c) 3-phosphoglycerate-mediated allosteric activation of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase.
