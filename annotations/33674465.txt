Zani <i>et al</i> (Research Articles, 27 November 2020, p. 1066) propose that enhancement of deciduous tree photosynthesis in a CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched atmosphere will advance autumn leaf senescence. This premise is not supported by consistent observations from free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (FACE) experiments. In most FACE experiments, leaf senescence or abscission was not altered or was delayed in trees exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>.

CO2: !enhances! Photosynthesis 
Deciduous Tree: !not affected by! CO2 
Leaf Senescence: !delayed in! Trees exposed to elevated CO2
