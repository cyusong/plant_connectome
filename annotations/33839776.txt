KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2) was first identified as a receptor of karrikins, smoke-derived germination stimulants. KAI2 is also considered a receptor of an unidentified endogenous molecule called the KAI2 ligand. Upon KAI2 activation, signals are transmitted through the degradation of D53/SMXL proteins via MAX2-dependent ubiquitination. Although components in the KAI2-dependent signaling pathway, namely MpKAI2A and MpKAI2B, MpMAX2, and MpSMXL, exist in the genome of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, their functions remain unknown. Here, we show that early thallus growth is retarded and gemma dormancy in the dark is suppressed in Mpkai2a and Mpmax2 loss-of-function mutants. These defects are counteracted in Mpkai2a Mpsmxl and Mpmax2 Mpsmxl double mutants indicating that MpKAI2A, MpMAX2, and MpSMXL act in the same genetic pathway. Introduction of MpSMXLd53, in which a domain required for degradation is mutated, into wild-type plants mimicks Mpkai2a and Mpmax2 plants. In addition, the detection of citrine fluorescence in Nicotiana benthamiana cells transiently expressing a SMXL-Citrine fusion protein requires treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. These findings imply that MpSMXL is subjected to degradation, and that the degradation of MpSMXL is crucial for MpKAI2A-dependent signaling in M. polymorpha. Therefore, we claim that the basic mechanisms in the KAI2-dependent signaling pathway are conserved in M. polymorpha.
