Citrus plants are challenged by a broad diversity of abiotic and biotic stresses, which definitely alter their growth, development, and productivity. In order to survive the various stressful conditions, citrus plants relay on multi-layered adaptive strategies, among which is the accumulation of stress-associated metabolites that play vital and complex roles in citrus defensive responses. These metabolites included amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, phytohormones, polyamines (PAs), and other secondary metabolites. However, the contribution of PAs pathways in citrus defense responses is poorly understood. In this review article, we will discuss the recent metabolic, genetic, and molecular evidence illustrating the potential roles of PAs in citrus defensive responses against biotic and abiotic stressors. We believe that PAs-based defensive role, against biotic and abiotic stress in citrus, is involving the interaction with other stress-associated metabolites, particularly phytohormones. The knowledge gained so far about PAs-based defensive responses in citrus underpins our need for further genetic manipulation of PAs biosynthetic genes to produce transgenic citrus plants with modulated PAs content that may enhance the tolerance of citrus plants against stressful conditions. In addition, it provides valuable information for the potential use of PAs or their synthetic analogs and their emergence as a promising approach to practical applications in citriculture to enhance stress tolerance in citrus plants.
