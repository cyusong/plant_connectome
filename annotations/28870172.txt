Lysin motif (LysM)-containing proteins are important pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in plants, which function in the perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and in the defense against pathogenic attack. To date, the LysM genes have not been systematically analyzed in cotton or effectively utilized for disease resistance. Here, we identified 29, 30, 60, and 56 LysM genes in the four sequenced cotton species, diploid Gossypium raimondii, diploid G. arboreum, tetraploid G. hirsutum acc. TM-1, and G. barbadense acc. 3-79, respectively. These LysM genes were classified into four groups with different structural characteristics and a variety of expression patterns in different organs and tissues when induced by chitin or Verticillium dahliae. We further characterized three genes, Lyp1, Lyk7 and LysMe3, which showed significant increase in expression in response to chitin signals, V. dahliae challenge and several stress-related signaling compounds. Lyp1, Lyk7 and LysMe3 proteins were localized to the plasma membrane, and silencing of their expression in cotton drastically impaired salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and reactive oxygen species generation, impaired defense gene activation, and compromised resistance to V. dahliae. Our results indicate that Lyp1, Lyk7, and LysMe3 are important PRRs that function in the recognition of chitin signals to activate the downstream defense processes and induce cotton defense mechanisms against V. dahliae.
