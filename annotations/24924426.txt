Cell differentiation has been associated with changes in mechanical stiffness in single-cell systems, yet it is unknown whether this association remains true in a multicellular context, particularly in developing tissues. In order to address such questions, we have developed a methodology, termed quantitative tandem epifluorescence and nanoindentation, wherein we sequentially determine cellular genetic identity with confocal microscopy and mechanical properties with atomic force microscopy. We have applied this approach to examine cellular stiffness at the shoot apices of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants carrying a fluorescent reporter for the CLAVATA3 (CLV3) gene, which encodes a secreted glycopeptide involved in the regulation of the centrally located stem cell zone in inflorescence and floral meristems. We found that these CLV3-expressing cells are characterized by an enhanced stiffness. Additionally, by tracking cells in young flowers before and after the onset of GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN expression, we observed that an increase in stiffness coincides with this onset. This work illustrates how quantitative tandem epifluorescence and nanoindentation can reveal the spatial and temporal dynamics of both gene expression and cell mechanics at the shoot apex and, by extension, in the epidermis of any thick tissue.
