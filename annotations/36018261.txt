The trans-Golgi network (TGN) acts as a central platform for sorting and secreting various cargoes to the cell surface, thus being essential for the full execution of plant immunity. However, the fine-tuned regulation of TGN components in plant defense and stress response has been not fully elucidated. Our study revealed that despite largely compromising penetration resistance, the loss-of-function mutation of the TGN component protein ECHIDNA (ECH) induced enhanced postinvasion resistance to powdery mildew in Arabidopsis thaliana. Genetic and transcriptome analyses and hormone profiling demonstrated that ECH loss resulted in salicylic acid (SA) hyperaccumulation via the ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1 biosynthesis pathway, thereby constitutively activating SA-dependent innate immunity that was largely responsible for the enhanced postinvasion resistance. Furthermore, the ech mutant displayed accelerated SA-independent spontaneous cell death and constitutive POWDERY MILDEW RESISTANCE 4-mediated callose depositions. In addition, ECH loss led to a chronically prolonged endoplasmic reticulum stress in the ech mutant. These results provide insights into understanding the role of TGN components in the regulation of plant immunity and stress responses.
