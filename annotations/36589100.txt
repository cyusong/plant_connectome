<i>Pinus massoniana</i> is a pioneer tree widely planted for afforestation on barren hills in southern China where the total planted area is 8.04 million ha. The invasive pine wood nematode (<i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>) poses a serious threat to the survival of <i>P. massoniana</i>. Plant resistance genes encoded by leucine-rich repeat-containing transmembrane-receptor proteins play important roles in plant defense. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs), the largest subfamily of the RLK protein family, play an important role in sensing stress signals in plants. However, the LRR-RLKs of <i>P. massoniana</i> have not been characterized previously, and their role in resistance to <i>B. xylophilus</i> is unknown. In this study, 185 members of the LRR-RLK subfamily were identified in <i>P. massoniana</i> and were categorized into 14 subgroups. Transcriptomic and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses showed that <i>PmRLKs32</i> was highly expressed in the stem tissue after inoculation with <i>B. xylophilus</i>. The gene exhibited high homology with <i>AtFLS2</i> of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. <i>PmRLKs32</i> was localized to the plasma membrane and was significantly upregulated in nematode-resistant and nematode-susceptible individuals. The transient expression of <i>PmRLKs32</i> resulted in a burst of reactive oxygen species production in <i>P. massoniana</i> and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> seedlings. These results lay a foundation for further exploration of the regulatory mechanism of LRR-RLKs in response to biotic stress in <i>P. massoniana</i>.
