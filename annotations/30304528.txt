Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can modulate plant defenses against herbivorous arthropods. We investigated how different UV exposure times and irradiance intensities affected tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) resistance to thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) by assessing UV effects on thrips-associated damage and host-selection, selected metabolite and phytohormone contents, expression of defense-related genes, and trichome density and chemistry, the latter having dual roles in defense and UV protection. Short UV daily exposure times increased thrips resistance in the cultivar 'Moneymaker' but this could not be explained by changes in the contents of selected leaf polyphenols or terpenes, nor by trichome-associated defenses. UV irradiance intensity also affected resistance to thrips. Further analyses using the tomato mutants def-1, impaired in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, od-2, defective in the production of functional type-VI trichomes, and their wild-type, 'Castlemart', showed that UV enhanced thrips resistance in Moneymaker and od-2, but not in def-1 and Castlemart. UV increased salicylic acid (SA) and JA-isoleucine concentrations, and increased expression of SA- and JA-associated genes in Moneymaker, while inducing expression of JA-defensive genes in od-2. Our results demonstrate that UV-mediated enhancement of tomato resistance to thrips is probably associated with the activation of JA-associated signaling, but not with plant secondary metabolism or trichome-related traits.
