Increases in growth at elevated [CO2] may be constrained by a plant's ability to assimilate the nutrients needed for new tissue in sufficient quantity to match the increase in carbon fixation and/or the ability to transport those nutrients and carbon in sufficient quantity to growing organs and tissues. Analysis of metabolites provides an indication of shifts in carbon and nitrogen partitioning due to rising atmospheric [CO2] and can help identify where bottlenecks in carbon utilization occur. In this study, the carbon and nitrogen balance was investigated in growing and fully expanded soybean leaves exposed to elevated [CO2] in a free air CO2 enrichment experiment. Diurnal photosynthesis and diurnal profiles of carbon and nitrogen metabolites were measured during two different crop growth stages. Diurnal carbon gain was increased by c. 20% in elevated [CO2] in fully expanded leaves, which led to significant increases in leaf hexose, sucrose, and starch contents. However, there was no detectable difference in nitrogen-rich amino acids and ureides in mature leaves. By contrast to mature leaves, developing leaves had high concentrations of ureides and amino acids relative to low concentrations of carbohydrates. Developing leaves at elevated [CO2] had smaller pools of ureides compared with developing leaves at ambient [CO2], which suggests N assimilation in young leaves was improved by elevated [CO2]. This work shows that elevated [CO2] alters the balance of carbon and nitrogen pools in both mature and growing soybean leaves, which could have down-stream impacts on growth and productivity.
