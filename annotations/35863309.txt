Ripening of climacteric fruits is initiated when the gaseous plant hormone ethylene is perceived by the cell. Ethylene binding to membrane-associated ethylene receptors (ETRs) triggers a series of biochemical events through multiple components, resulting in the induction of numerous ripening-related genes. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), there are seven members of the ETR family, which each contribute to the regulation of fruit ripening. However, the relative contribution of each individual receptor to ethylene signaling remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated the formation of heteromeric receptor complexes across the two ETR subfamilies in tomato fruit. Immunoprecipitation of subfamily II SlETR4 resulted in co-purification of subfamily I (SlETR1, SlETR2, and SlETR3), but not subfamily II members (SlETR5, SlETR6, and SlETR7). Such biased interactions were verified in yeast two-hybrid assays, and in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, in which heterologous SlETR4 interacts with subfamily I ETRs. Our analysis also revealed that the receptor complexes engage the Raf-like protein kinases SlCTR1 and SlCTR3, which are potential regulators of signaling. Here, we suggest that tomato receptor members form heteromeric complexes to fine-tune signal output to the downstream pathway, which is similar to that of the Arabidopsis system but appears to be partially diverged.
