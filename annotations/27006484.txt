We provide an overview of methods and workflows that can be used to investigate the topologies of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) in the context of plant evolutionary-developmental (evo-devo) biology. Many of the species that occupy key positions in plant phylogeny are poorly adapted as laboratory models and so we focus here on techniques that can be efficiently applied to both model and non-model species of interest to plant evo-devo. We outline methods that can be used to describe gene expression patterns and also to elucidate the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying these patterns, in any plant species with a sequenced genome. We furthermore describe how the technique of Protein Resurrection can be used to confirm inferences on ancestral GRNs and also to provide otherwise-inaccessible points of reference in evolutionary histories by exploiting paralogues generated in gene and whole genome duplication events. Finally, we argue for the better integration of molecular data with information from paleobotanical, paleoecological, and paleogeographical studies to provide the fullest possible picture of the processes that have shaped the evolution of plant development.
