['26979329', 'Transposable elements (TEs) make up a large proportion of eukaryotic genomes. As  their mobilization creates genetic variation that threatens genome integrity, TEs  are epigenetically silenced through several pathways, and this may spread to  neighboring sequences. JUMONJI (JMJ) proteins can function as antisilencing  factors and prevent silencing of genes next to TEs Whether TE silencing is  counterbalanced by the activity of antisilencing factors is still unclear. Here,  we characterize JMJ24 as a regulator of TE silencing. We show that loss of JMJ24  results in increased silencing of the DNA transposon AtMu1c, while overexpression  of JMJ24 reduces silencing. JMJ24 has a JumonjiC (JmjC) domain and two RING  domains. JMJ24 autoubiquitinates in vitro, demonstrating E3 ligase activity of  the RING domain(s). JMJ24-JmjC binds the N-terminal tail of histone H3, and  full-length JMJ24 binds histone H3 in vivo. JMJ24 activity is anticorrelated with  histone H3 Lys 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) levels at AtMu1c Double mutant analyses  with epigenetic silencing mutants suggest that JMJ24 antagonizes histone H3K9me2  and requires H3K9 methyltransferases for its activity on AtMu1c Genome-wide  transcriptome analysis indicates that JMJ24 affects silencing at additional TEs  Our results suggest that the JmjC domain of JMJ24 has lost demethylase activity  but has been retained as a binding domain for histone H3. This is in line with  phylogenetic analyses indicating that JMJ24 (with the mutated JmjC domain) is  widely conserved in angiosperms. Taken together, this study assigns a role in TE  silencing to a conserved JmjC-domain protein with E3 ligase activity, but no  demethylase activity.', '2016 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.01688', 'ORCID:']
