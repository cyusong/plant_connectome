Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN1A (<i>At</i>DRP1A) and <i>At</i>DRP2B are large GTPases that function together in endocytosis for effective cytokinesis, cell enlargement and development. A recent study shows that these DRPs contribute to ligand-induced endocytosis of the immune receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (<i>At</i>FLS2) to modulate flg22-immune signaling, and they are required for immunity against <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> bacteria. Here, we demonstrate that <i>atdrp1a</i> and <i>atdrp2b</i> single mutants showed increased susceptibility to <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> indicating that <i>At</i>DRP1A and <i>At</i>DRP2B are necessary for effective resistance against this necrotrophic fungus. Thus, we expanded our limited understanding of clathrin endocytic accessory proteins in immunity against plant pathogens.
