For the establishment of the Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis it is essential that epidermis and cortical cells from plant roots suffer a strong reorganization to allow the penetration of intracellular fungal hyphae. In the same manner, the new formation of a periarbuscular membrane and a symbiotic interface with specific compositions are required for a functional symbiosis. It is believed that the cytoskeleton of the plant host plays an essential role in these processes, particularly the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton, as huge modifications have been observed in the MT array of root cells accompanying the establishment of the AM symbiosis. Recent research has established a link between microtubule rearrangements and arbuscule functioning. However, further research is required to elucidate the specific functions of MT cytoskeleton along the different stages of the arbuscule life cycle and to unravel the signals triggering these changes.
