['28675462', 'In higher plants, chloroplasts carry out many important functions, and normal  chloroplast development is required for embryogenesis. Numerous  chloroplast-targeted proteins involved in embryogenesis have been identified.  Nevertheless, their functions remain unclear. In this study, a  chloroplast-localized protein, EMB2738, was reported to be involved in  Arabidopsis embryogenesis. EMB2738 knockout led to defective embryos, and the  embryo development in emb2738 was interrupted after the globular stage.  Complementation experiments identified the AT3G12080 locus as EMB2738. Cellular  observation indicated that severely impaired chloroplast development was observed  in these aborted embryos. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain  reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that chloroplast-encoded photosynthetic genes,  which are transcribed by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP), are predominantly  decreased in defective embryogenesis, compared with those in the wild-type. In  contrast, genes encoding PEP core subunits, which are transcribed by  nucleus-encoded RNA polymerase (NEP), were increased. These results suggested  that the knockout of EMB2738 strongly blocked chloroplast-encoded photosynthesis  gene expression in embryos. Silencing of the EMB2738 orthologue in tobacco  through a virus-induced genome silencing technique resulted in an albinism  phenotype, vacuolated chloroplasts and decreased PEP-dependent plastid  transcription. These results suggested that NtEMB2738 might be involved in  plastid gene expression. Nevertheless, genetic analysis showed that the NtEMB2738  coding sequence could not fully rescue the defective embryogenesis of the emb2738  mutant, which suggested functional divergence between NtEMB2738 and EMB2738 in  embryogenesis. Taken together, these results indicated that both EMB2738 and  NtEMB2738 are involved in the expression of plastid genes in higher plants, and  there is a functional divergence between NtEMB2738 and EMB2738 in embryogenesis.', '2017 Nov', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1111/ppl.12603', 'ORCID:']
