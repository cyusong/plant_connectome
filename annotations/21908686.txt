['21908686', 'The membrane protein AtTLP18.3 of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) contains a  domain of unknown function, DUF477; it forms a polysome with photosynthetic  apparatuses in the thylakoid lumen. To explore the molecular function of  AtTLP18.3, we resolved its crystal structures with residues 83 to 260, the DUF477  only, and performed a series of biochemical analyses to discover its function.  The gene expression of AtTLP18.3 followed a circadian rhythm. X-ray  crystallography revealed the folding of AtTLP18.3 as a three-layer sandwich with  three alpha-helices in the upper layer, four beta-sheets in the middle layer, and two  alpha-helices in the lower layer, which resembles a Rossmann fold. Structural  comparison suggested that AtTLP18.3 might be a phosphatase. The enzymatic  activity of AtTLP18.3 was further confirmed by phosphatase assay with various  substrates (e.g. p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl  phosphate, O-phospho-L-serine, and several synthetic phosphopeptides).  Furthermore, we obtained the structure of AtTLP18.3 in complex with  O-phospho-L-serine to identify the binding site of AtTLP18.3. Our structural and  biochemical studies revealed that AtTLP18.3 has the molecular function of a novel  acid phosphatase in the thylakoid lumen. DUF477 is accordingly renamed the  thylakoid acid phosphatase domain.', '2011 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.184739', 'Cheng']
