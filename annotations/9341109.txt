['9341109', 'The molybdenum cofactor is an essential part of all eukaryotic molybdoenzymes. It  is a molybdopterin (MPT) revealing the same core structure in all organisms. The  plant protein Cnx1 from Arabidopsis thaliana is involved in the multi-step  biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor. Previous studies (Stallmeyer, B., Nerlich,  A., Schiemann, J., Brinkmann, H., and Mendel, R. R. (1995) Plant J. 8, 751-762)  suggested a function of Cnx1 in a late step of cofactor biosynthesis distal to  the formation of MPT, i.e. conversion of MPT into molybdenum cofactor. Here we  present the first biochemical evidences confirming this assumption. The protein  Cnx1 consists of two domains (E and G) homologous to two distinct Escherichia  coli proteins involved in cofactor synthesis. Binding studies with recombinantly  expressed and purified Cnx1 and with its single domains revealed a high affinity  of the G domain to MPT (kD = 0.1 microM) with equimolar binding. In contrast, the  E domain of Cnx1 binds MPT with lower affinity (kD = 1.6 microM) and in a  cooperative manner (nH = 1. 5). The entire Cnx1 showed a tight and cooperative  MPT binding. Based on these data providing a common link between both domains  that matches the previous characterization of plant and bacterial Cnx1 homologous  mutants, we present a model for the function of Cnx1.', '1997 Oct 24', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.272.43.26811', 'Mendel']
