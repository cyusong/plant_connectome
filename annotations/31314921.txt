Protein phosphorylation is a key signalling mechanism and has myriad effects on protein function. Phosphorylation by protein kinases can be reversed by protein phosphatases, thus allowing dynamic control of protein phosphorylation. Although this may suggest a straightforward kinase-phosphatase relationship, plant genomes contain five times more kinases than phosphatases. Here, we examine phospho-signalling from a protein phosphatase centred perspective and ask how relatively few phosphatases regulate many phosphorylation sites. The most abundant class of plant phosphatases, the protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2Cs), is surrounded by a web of regulation including inhibitor and activator proteins as well as posttranslational modifications that regulate phosphatase activity, control phosphatase stability, or determine the subcellular locations where the phosphatase is present and active. These mechanisms are best established for the Clade A PP2Cs, which are key components of stress and abscisic acid signalling. We also describe other PP2C clades and illustrate how these phosphatases are highly regulated and involved in a wide range of physiological functions. Together, these examples of multiple layers of phosphatase regulation help explain the unbalanced kinase-phosphatase ratio. Continued use of phosphoproteomics to examine phosphatase targets and phosphatase-kinase relationships will be important for deeper understanding of phosphoproteome regulation.
