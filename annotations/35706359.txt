Cold stress at the reproductive stage severely affects the production and geographic distribution of rice. The Geng/japonica subpopulation gradually developed stronger cold adaptation than the Xian/indica subpopulation during the long-term domestication of cultivated rice. However, the evolutionary path and natural alleles underlying the cold adaptability of intra-Geng subspecies remain largely unknown. Here, we identified MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3 (OsMAPK3) and LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEIN 9 (OsLEA9) as two important regulators for the cold adaptation of Geng subspecies from a combination of transcriptome analysis and genome-wide association study. Transgenic validation showed that OsMAPK3 and OsLEA9 confer cold tolerance at the reproductive stage. Selection and evolution analysis suggested that the Geng version of OsMAPK3 (OsMAPK3<sup>Geng</sup> ) directly evolved from Chinese Oryza rufipogon III and was largely retained in high-latitude and high-altitude regions with low temperatures during domestication. Later, the functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP-776) in the Kunmingxiaobaigu and Lijiangxiaoheigu version of the OsLEA9 (OsLEA9<sup>KL</sup> ) promoter originated from novel variation of intra-Geng was selected and predominantly retained in temperate Geng to improve the adaptation of Geng together with OsMAPK3<sup>Geng</sup> to colder climatic conditions in high-latitude areas. Breeding potential analysis suggested that pyramiding of OsMAPK3<sup>Geng</sup> and OsLEA9<sup>KL</sup> enhanced the cold tolerance of Geng and promotes the expansion of cultivated rice to colder regions. This study not only highlights the evolutionary path taken by the cold-adaptive differentiation of intra-Geng, but also provides new genetic resources for rice molecular breeding in low-temperature areas.
