Cyclic electron transport/flow (CET/CEF) in chloroplasts is a regulatory process essential for the optimization of plant photosynthetic efficiency. A crucial CEF pathway is catalyzed by a membrane-embedded NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex that contains at least 29 protein subunits and associates with photosystem I (PSI) to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we report the 3.9 Å resolution structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana NDH-PSI (AtNDH-PSI) supercomplex. We constructed structural models for 26 AtNDH subunits, among which 11 are unique to chloroplasts and stabilize the core part of the NDH complex. In the supercomplex, one NDH can bind up to two PSI-light-harvesting complex I (PSI-LHCI) complexes at both sides of its membrane arm. Two minor LHCIs, Lhca5 and Lhca6, each present in one PSI-LHCI, interact with NDH and contribute to supercomplex formation and stabilization. Collectively, our study reveals the structural details of the AtNDH-PSI supercomplex assembly and provides a molecular basis for further investigation of the regulatory mechanism of CEF in plants.
