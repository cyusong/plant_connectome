The architecture of many hormone perceptions and signalling pathways has been recently well established, together with an awareness that plant hormone responses are the product of networks of interactions involving multiple hormones. As growth is quantitative, so are hormone responses, which underlie a systems approach to development and response. Auxin is arguably one of the best characterised hormones in plant development, and despite many excellent reviews on auxin perception, polar transport, and signal transduction, too little attention has been given to auxin crosstalk. This review, therefore, gives a précis of recent developments in hormone crosstalk involving auxin. For decades, the literature has described the involvement of multiple hormones in particular processes, although the mechanistic bases underlying points of crosstalk have been harder to pinpoint. Crosstalk falls into different categories, such as direct, indirect, or co-regulation. One conclusion for auxin crosstalk is that crosstalk operates extensively via the metabolism of other hormones, however, microarray approaches are increasingly identifying co-regulated genes and nodes of crosstalk at shared signalling components. Auxin crosstalk is often local, and is spatially and temporally regulated to provide adaptive value to environmental conditions and fine-tuning of responses.
