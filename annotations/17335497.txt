* Actin organization and dynamics are essential for cell division, growth and cytoplasmic streaming. Here we analyse the effects of the overexpression of Actin Interacting Protein 1 (AIP1) on Arabidopsis development. * Arabidopsis plants were transformed with an ethanol-inducible AIP1 construct and the characteristics of these plants were analysed after induction. * When AIP1 was increased to approx. 90% above wild-type values, root hair development and actin organization in all cell types examined were disrupted. * Our data demonstrate that AIP1 is a key regulator of actin organization and that its regulation is essential for normal plant cell morphogenesis.
