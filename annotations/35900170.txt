Petal senescence is a crucial determinant for ornamental quality and economic value of floral crops. Salicylic acid (SA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are two prominent factors involved in plant senescence regulation. In this study, tulip TgNAP (NAC-like, activated by APETALA3/PISTILLATA) was characterized as positively regulating tulip petal senescence through dually regulating SA biosynthesis and ROS detoxification pathways. TgNAP was upregulated in senescing petals of tulip while exogenous SA and H2O2 treatments substantially promoted petal senescence in tulip. Silencing of TgNAP by VIGS assay delayed SA and H2O2-induced petal senescence in tulip, whereas overexpression of TgNAP promoted the senescence process in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Additionally, inhibition of SA biosynthesis prolonged the lifespan of TgNAP-silenced petal discs. Further evidence indicated that TgNAP activates the transcriptions of two key SA biosynthetic genes ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1 (TgICS1) and PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE 1 (TgPAL1) through directly binding to their promoter regions. Meanwhile, TgNAP repressed ROS scavenging by directly inhibiting PEROXIDASE 12 (POD12) and POD17 expression. Taken together, these results indicate that TgNAP enhances SA biosynthesis and ROS accumulation to positively regulate petal senescence in tulip.
