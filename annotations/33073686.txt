In order to explore the main limiting factors affecting the growth and physiological function of alfalfa under salt and alkali stress, the effect of the salt and alkali stress on the growth and physiological function of alfalfa was studied. The results showed that effects of the excessive salt concentration (100 and 200 mM) on the growth and physiological characteristics were significantly greater than that of pH (7.0 and 9.0). Under 100 mM salt stress, there was no significant difference in the growth and photosynthetic function between pH 9.0 and pH 7.0. Under the 200 mM salt concentration the absorption of Na<sup>+</sup> by alfalfa treated at the pH 9.0 did not increase significantly compared with absorption at the pH 7.0. However, the higher pH directly reduced the root activity, leaf's water content, and N-<i>P</i>-K content also decreased significantly. The PSII and PSI activities decreased with increasing the salt concentration, especially the damage degree of PSI. Although the photoinhibition of PSII was not significant, PSII donor and electron transfer from the <i>Q</i><sub>A</sub> to <i>Q</i><sub>B</sub> of the PSII receptor sides was inhibited. In a word, alfalfa showed relatively strong salt tolerance capacity, at the 100 mM salt concentration, even when the pH reached 9.0. Thus, the effect on the growth and photosynthetic function was not significant. However, at 200 mM salt concentration, pH 9.0 treatment caused damage to root system and the photosynthetic function in leaves of alfalfa was seriously injured.
