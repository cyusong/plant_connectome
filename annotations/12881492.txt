['12881492', 'GSH has multiple actions in physiological responses of plants, but the molecular  mechanisms are not fully understood. GSH plays an important role in functional  alteration of proteins by reversible covalent incorporation (glutathionylation)  in vertebrate cells. To investigate the function of glutathionylation in plant  cells, we examined glutathionylated proteins in the suspension-cultured cells of  Arabidopsis using biotinylated GSH. Biotinylated GSH was incorporated into about  20 proteins. Two of these proteins were identified as the key enzymes for sugar  metabolism, triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) and putative plastidic aldolase.  Recombinant TPI was inactivated by GSSG, and it was reactivated by GSH. The  physiological roles of glutathionylation of TPI and aldolase in sugar metabolism  are discussed.', '2003 Jul', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcg098', 'Ogawa']
