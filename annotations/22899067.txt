Cytokinins are plant hormones with profound roles in growth and development. Cytokinin signaling is mediated through a 'two-component' signaling system composed of histidine kinases, histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins, and response regulators. Phylogenetic analysis of two-component signaling elements from the monocot rice and the dicot Arabidopsis reveals lineage-specific expansions of the type-B response regulators, transcription factors that act as positive regulators for the cytokinin signal. We recently reported in Plant Physiology on a functional analysis of rice type-B response regulators. A type-B response regulator from a subfamily comprised of both monocot and dicot type-B response regulators complemented an Arabidopsis type-B response regulator mutant, but a type-B response regulator from a monocot-specific subfamily generally did not. Here, we extend this analysis to demonstrate that the promoter of an Arabidopsis cytokinin primary response gene is induced by type-B response regulators from a shared subfamily, but not by one from a lineage-specific subfamily. These results support a model in which the type-B response regulators of monocots and dicots share conserved roles in the cytokinin signaling pathway but have also diverged to take on lineage-specific roles.
