The relationship between carboxylate release and the ability of plants to access phosphorus from AlPO4 and to detoxify aluminium was studied by comparing species with a low and high rate of carboxylate release, Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Lupinus albus (white lupin), respectively. Species were supplied with P at 10, 20, 40 or 100 mg P kg-1 sand in the form of sparingly soluble AlPO4 or soluble KH2PO4; control plants did not receive any P. Triticum aestivum was significantly better than L. albus at accessing P from AlPO4, despite accumulating fewer carboxylates in its rhizosphere. Rhizosphere pH of L. albus did not vary with form or level of P supply, while the rhizosphere pH of T. aestivum increased with the level of P supplied. Based on the evidence in the present study, a model is proposed to explain the poor performance of L. albus, whereby the release of carboxylates and associated protons reduces the chelating ability of exuded carboxylates, thus reducing P acquisition and increasing Al toxicity.

Triticum aestivum: !accesses! P from AlPO4
Lupinus albus: !releases! carboxylates
carboxylates: !reduces chelating ability of! exuded carboxylates
carboxylates: !increases! Al toxicity
Triticum aestivum: !increases! rhizosphere pH with P supply
