The vast majority of agricultural land undergoes abiotic stress that can significantly reduce agricultural yields. Understanding the mechanisms of plant defenses against stresses and putting this knowledge into practice is, therefore, an integral part of sustainable agriculture. In this review, we focus on current findings in plant resistance to four cardinal abiotic stressors-drought, heat, salinity, and low temperatures. Apart from the description of the newly discovered mechanisms of signaling and resistance to abiotic stress, this review also focuses on the importance of primary and secondary metabolites, including carbohydrates, amino acids, phenolics, and phytohormones. A meta-analysis of transcriptomic studies concerning the model plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> demonstrates the long-observed phenomenon that abiotic stressors induce different signals and effects at the level of gene expression, but genes whose regulation is similar under most stressors can still be traced. The analysis further reveals the transcriptional modulation of Golgi-targeted proteins in response to heat stress. Our analysis also highlights several genes that are similarly regulated under all stress conditions. These genes support the central role of phytohormones in the abiotic stress response, and the importance of some of these in plant resistance has not yet been studied. Finally, this review provides information about the response to abiotic stress in major European crop plants-wheat, sugar beet, maize, potatoes, barley, sunflowers, grapes, rapeseed, tomatoes, and apples.
