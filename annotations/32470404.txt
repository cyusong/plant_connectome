Approximately 500 Ma ago, freshwater algae adapted to live on Earth's surface, subsequently enabling animal life to pursue. Over the last decade, genomes of non-seed plants enabled us to infer trait evolution of early land plants. In this issue of Cell, Jiao et al. uncovered another genome, of the streptophyte algae Penium, enhancing our understanding of the water-to-land transition.
