['10849337', 'The single yeast gene (PAB1) encoding poly (A) binding protein (PABP) has several  roles in post-transcriptional processes, including translation initiation and  mRNA decay. PABP is encoded by a large gene family in plants. Within Arabidopsis  thaliana, the several characterized PABP genes exhibit an extreme degree of  sequence divergence and are differentially expressed. Arabidopsis PAB2 is  expressed in distinct tissues or during defined developmental windows in most  plant organs. In this study we demonstrate that PAB2 restores viability to a  yeast pab1 mutant strain. Yeast strains containing wild-type, null (PAB2s) and  temperature sensitive (PAB2ts) alleles of PAB2 were used to explore the molecular  functions of the plant protein. PAB2 can participate in poly (A) tail shortening,  thus demonstrating that it interacts with the yeast poly(A) nuclease complex.  PAB2 is required for translation, helping to maintain intact polysome structures.  Consistent with its role in translation initiation, poly (A) was found to enhance  PAB2 binding to Arabidopsis eIF-iso4G in vitro. In addition, PAB2 can partially  restore the linkage between deadenylation, decapping and mRNA decay in yeast.  Taken together, our results suggest that Arabidopsis PAB2 participates in many of  the same complex post-transcriptional processes identified for yeast PAB1, and is  functionally distinct from other characterized Arabidopsis PABPs.', '2000 May', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00721.x', 'Meagher']
