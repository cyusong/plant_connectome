Feedbacks between plants and soil microbes form a keystone to terrestrial community and ecosystem dynamics. Recent advances in dissecting the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) have challenged longstanding assumptions of spatially well-mixed microbial communities and exceedingly fast microbial assembly dynamics relative to plant lifespans. Instead, PSFs emerge from interactions that are inherently mismatched in spatial and temporal scales, and explicitly considering these spatial and temporal dynamics is crucial to understanding the contribution of PSFs to foundational ecological patterns. I propose a synthetic spatiotemporal framework for future research that pairs experimental and modeling approaches grounded in mechanism to improve predictability and generalizability of PSFs.
