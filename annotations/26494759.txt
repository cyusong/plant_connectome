['26494759', 'Energy production by chloroplasts and mitochondria causes constant oxidative  damage. A functioning photosynthetic cell requires quality-control mechanisms to  turn over and degrade chloroplasts damaged by reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Here, we generated a conditionally lethal Arabidopsis mutant that accumulated  excess protoporphyrin IX in the chloroplast and produced singlet oxygen. Damaged  chloroplasts were subsequently ubiquitinated and selectively degraded. A genetic  screen identified the plant U-box 4 (PUB4) E3 ubiquitin ligase as being necessary  for this process. pub4-6 mutants had defects in stress adaptation and longevity.  Thus, we have identified a signal that leads to the targeted removal of  ROS-overproducing chloroplasts.', '2015 Oct 23', 'Science', '10.1126/science.aac7444', 'Chory']
