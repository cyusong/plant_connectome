['11706164', 'We report here the isolation of the Arabidopsis SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS  RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1 (AtSERK1) gene and we demonstrate its role during  establishment of somatic embryogenesis in culture. The AtSERK1 gene is highly  expressed during embryogenic cell formation in culture and during early  embryogenesis. The AtSERK1 gene is first expressed in planta during  megasporogenesis in the nucellus [corrected] of developing ovules, in the  functional megaspore, and in all cells of the embryo sac up to fertilization.  After fertilization, AtSERK1 expression is seen in all cells of the developing  embryo until the heart stage. After this stage, AtSERK1 expression is no longer  detectable in the embryo or in any part of the developing seed. Low expression is  detected in adult vascular tissue. Ectopic expression of the full-length AtSERK1  cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter did not  result in any altered plant phenotype. However, seedlings that overexpressed the  AtSERK1 mRNA exhibited a 3- to 4-fold increase in efficiency for initiation of  somatic embryogenesis. Thus, an increased AtSERK1 level is sufficient to confer  embryogenic competence in culture.', '2001 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '6882', 'de']
