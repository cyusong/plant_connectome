['27432987', "Intracellular signaling during oxidative stress is complex, with  organelle-to-nucleus retrograde communication pathways ill-defined or incomplete.  Here we identify the 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) phosphatase SAL1 as a  previously unidentified and conserved oxidative stress sensor in plant  chloroplasts. Arabidopsis thaliana SAL1 (AtSAL1) senses changes in photosynthetic  redox poise, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide concentrations in chloroplasts via  redox regulatory mechanisms. AtSAL1 phosphatase activity is suppressed by  dimerization, intramolecular disulfide formation, and glutathionylation, allowing  accumulation of its substrate, PAP, a chloroplast stress retrograde signal that  regulates expression of plastid redox associated nuclear genes (PRANGs). This  redox regulation of SAL1 for activation of chloroplast signaling is conserved in  the plant kingdom, and the plant protein has evolved enhanced redox sensitivity  compared with its yeast ortholog. Our results indicate that in addition to sulfur  metabolism, SAL1 orthologs have evolved secondary functions in oxidative stress  sensing in the plant kingdom.", '2016 Aug 2', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1604936113', 'Pogson']
