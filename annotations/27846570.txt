['27846570', 'Cryptochromes are blue-light receptors that regulate development and the  circadian clock in plants and animals. We found that Arabidopsis cryptochrome 2  (CRY2) undergoes blue light-dependent homodimerization to become physiologically  active. We identified BIC1 (blue-light inhibitor of cryptochromes 1) as an  inhibitor of plant cryptochromes that binds to CRY2 to suppress the blue  light-dependent dimerization, photobody formation, phosphorylation, degradation,  and physiological activities of CRY2. We hypothesize that regulated dimerization  governs homeostasis of the active cryptochromes in plants and other evolutionary  lineages.', '2016 Oct 21', 'Science', '10.1126/science.aaf9030', 'Lin']
