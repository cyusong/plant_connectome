Protein synthesis is an essential but energetically expensive cellular process that is challenged under environmental stress in plants. Recent work demonstrates that the plant hormone ethylene, through GCN2, represses general translation during flooding stress to conserve energy. Moreover, ethylene also promotes the translation of specific stress-responsive mRNAs to survive submergence stress.
