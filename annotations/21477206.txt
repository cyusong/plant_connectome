• In Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) RNA replication, replicase-associated protein CMV 1a and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein CMV 2a are essential for formation of an active virus replicase complex on vacuolar membranes. • To identify plant host factors involved in CMV replication, a yeast two-hybrid system was used with CMV 1a protein as bait. One of the candidate genes encoded Tsi1-interacting protein 1 (Tsip1), a zinc (Zn) finger protein. Tsip1 strongly interacted with CMV 2a protein, too. • Formation of a Tsip1 complex involving CMV 1a or CMV 2a was confirmed in vitro and in planta. When 35S::Tsip1 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants were inoculated with CMV-Kor, disease symptom development was delayed and the accumulation of CMV RNAs and coat protein was decreased in both the infected local leaves and the uninfected upper leaves, compared with the wild type, whereas Tsip1-RNAi plants showed modestly but consistently increased CMV susceptibility. In a CMV replication assay, CMV RNA concentrations were reduced in the 35S::Tsip1 transgenic protoplasts compared with wild-type (WT) protoplasts. • These results indicate that Tsip1 might directly control CMV multiplication in tobacco plants by formation of a complex with CMV 1a and CMV 2a.
