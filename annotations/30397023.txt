['30397023', 'The reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PSII), which is composed of D1, D2,  PsbI, and cytochrome b559 subunits, forms at an early stage of PSII biogenesis.  However, it is largely unclear how these components assemble to form a functional  unit. In this work, we show that synthesis of the PSII core proteins D1/D2 and  formation of the PSII RC is blocked specifically in the absence of ONE-HELIX  PROTEIN1 (OHP1) and OHP2 proteins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana),  indicating that OHP1 and OHP2 are essential for the formation of the PSII RC.  Mutagenesis of the chlorophyll-binding residues in OHP proteins impairs their  function and/or stability, suggesting that they may function in the binding of  chlorophyll in vivo. We further show that OHP1, OHP2, and HIGH CHLOROPHYLL  FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244), together with D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome b559, form a  complex. We designated this complex the PSII RC-like complex to distinguish it  from the RC subcomplex in the intact PSII complex. Our data imply that OHP1,  OHP2, and HCF244 are present in this PSII RC-like complex for a limited time at  an early stage of PSII de novo assembly and of PSII repair under high-light  conditions. In a subsequent stage of PSII biogenesis, OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are  released from the PSII RC-like complex and replaced by the other PSII subunits.  Together with previous reports on the cyanobacterium Synechocystis, our results  demonstrate that the process of PSII RC assembly is highly conserved among  photosynthetic species.', '2019 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.18.01231', 'ORCID:']
