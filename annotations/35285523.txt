['35285523', 'Organ size is an important agronomic trait. Small peptides function in various  stages of plant growth, but their regulatory mechanisms in organ growth remain  poorly understood. Here, we characterize a novel small peptide, AtZSP1, which  positively regulates organ size in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function mutant atzsp1-1  exhibited small organs, whereas AtZSP1 overexpression plants (p35S:AtZSP1#1)  produced larger organs. Differentially expressed genes in the shoots of atzsp1-1  and p35S:AtZSP1#1 were enriched in the cytokinin pathway. Further analysis on  shoots of atzsp1-1 showed that endogenous cytokinin levels were significantly  reduced, consistent with reduced expression of the cytokinin response genes  ARR5/6/7 and a decrease in pARR5:GUS activity. By contrast, cytokinin levels were  elevated in p35S:AtZSP1#1. These results indicate that AtZSP1 affects shoot size  via changes in cytokinin levels. AtZSP1 is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a  57-amino acid endomembrane-associated protein that is highly conserved among  plant species. AtZSP1 interacts with ROCK1 at the endomembrane. Genetic analysis  confirmed that the small organs and low cytokinin levels in atzsp1-1 shoots are  partially suppressed by the rock1-4 mutation, suggesting that AtZSP1 may function  in a common pathway with ROCK1 to antagonistically regulate organ growth. Our  study identified an unknown small peptide, AtZSP1, and defined its function in  regulating organ size in Arabidopsis.', '2022 Jun', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.18093', 'ORCID:']
