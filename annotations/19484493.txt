Abscisic acid (ABA) and sugars have been well established to be crucial factors controlling seed germination of Arabidopsis. Here we demonstrate that AtMKK1 and AtMPK6 are both critical signals involved in ABA and sugar-regulated seed germination. Wild type plants depended on stratification and after-ripening for seed germination, whereas this dependence on either stratification or after-ripening was not required for mutants of mkk1 and mpk6 as well as their double mutant mkk1 mpk6. While seed germination of wild type plants was sensitively inhibited by ABA and glucose, mkk1, mpk6 and mkk1 mpk6 were all strongly resistant to ABA or glucose treatments, and in contrast, plants overexpressing MKK1 or MPK6 were super-sensitive to ABA and glucose. Glucose treatment significantly induced increases in MKK1 and MPK6 activities. These results clearly indicate that MKK1 and MPK6 are involved in the ABA and sugar signaling in the process of seed germination. Further experiments showed that glucose was capable of inducing ABA biosynthesis by up-regulating NCED3 and ABA2, and furthermore, this up-regulation of NCED3 and ABA2 was arrested in the mkk1 mpk6 double mutant, indicating that the inhibition of seed germination by glucose is potentially resulted from sugar-induced up-regulation of the ABA level.
