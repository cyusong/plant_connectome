Grasses have evolved complex inflorescences, where the primary unit is the specialized short branch called a spikelet. Detailed studies of the cumulative action of the genetic regulators that direct the progressive change in axillary meristem identity and their terminal differentiation are crucial to understanding the complexities of the inflorescence and the development of a determinate floret. Grass florets also pose interesting questions concerning the morphologies and functions of organs as compared to other monocots and eudicots. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the regulation of the transitions that occur in grass inflorescence meristems, and of the specification of floret meristems and their determinate development. We primarily use rice as a model, with appropriate comparisons to other crop models and to the extensively studied eudicot Arabidopsis. The role of MADS-domain transcription factors in floral organ patterning is well documented in many eudicots and in grasses. However, there is evidence to suggest that some of these rice floral regulators have evolved distinctive functions and that other grass species-specific factors and regulatory pathways occur - for example the LOFSEP 'E' class genes OsMADS1 and OsMAD34, and ramosa genes. A better understanding of these systems and the epigenetic regulators and hormone signaling pathways that interact with them will provide new insights into the rice inflorescence meristem and the differentiation of its floret organs, and should indicate genetic tools that can be used to control yield-related traits in both rice and other cereal crops.
