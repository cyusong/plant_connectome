The spiral structure of the cyanobacterium Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis (Nordst.) Gomont was previously found to be altered by solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280-400 nm). However, how photosynthetic active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) and UVR interact in regulating this morphological change remains unknown. Here, we show that the spiral structure of A. platensis (D-0083) was compressed under PAR alone at 30 degrees C, but that at 20 degrees C, the spirals compressed only when exposed to PAR with added UVR, and that UVR alone (the PAR was filtered out) did not tighten the spiral structure, although its presence accelerated morphological regulation by PAR. Their helix pitch decreased linearly as the cells received increased PAR doses, and was reversible when they were transferred back to low PAR levels. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that a 52.0 kDa periplasmic protein was more abundant in tighter filaments, which may have been responsible for the spiral compression. This spiral change together with the increased abundance of the protein made the cells more resistant to high PAR as well as UVR, resulting in a higher photochemical yield.
