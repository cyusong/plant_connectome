Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup> ) is the major cation damaging crops in the salinised farmland. Previous studies have shown that the Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway is important for salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. Nevertheless, the SOS pathway remains poorly investigated in most crops. This study addresses the function of the SOS pathway and its association with the natural variation of salt tolerance in maize. First, we showed that a naturally occurring 4-bp frame-shifting deletion in ZmSOS1 caused the salt hypersensitive phenotype of the maize inbred line LH65. Accordingly, mutants lacking ZmSOS1 also displayed a salt hypersensitive phenotype, due to an impaired root-to-rhizosphere Na<sup>+</sup> efflux and an increased shoot Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. We next showed that the maize SOS3/SOS2 complex (ZmCBL4/ZmCIPK24a and ZmCBL8/ZmCIPK24a) phosphorylates ZmSOS1 therefore activating its Na<sup>+</sup> -transporting activity, with their loss-of-function mutants displaying salt hypersensitive phenotypes. Moreover, we observed that a LTR/Gypsy insertion decreased the expression of ZmCBL8, thereby increasing shoot Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in natural maize population. Taken together, our study demonstrated that the maize SOS pathway confers a conservative salt-tolerant role, and the components of SOS pathway (ZmSOS1 and ZmCBL8) confer the natural variations of Na<sup>+</sup> regulation and salt tolerance in maize, therefore providing important gene targets for breeding salt-tolerant maize.
