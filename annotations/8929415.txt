['8929415', 'In flowering plants, a series of cell-cell interactions govern the delivery of  sperm to the ovules through precise guidance of pollen tubes. Two Arabidopsis  genes, POP2 and POP3, were found that mediate pollen tube guidance and are  critical for self-fertility in diploid reproductive cells. The pop2 and pop3  mutations exhibited genetic redundancy: Self-sterility occurred only when male  and female tissues were defective in both genes. This phenotype resembles that  found in many self-incompatible species.', '1996 Nov 29', 'Science', '10.1126/science.274.5292.1535', 'Preuss']
