High salinity is one of the major problems in crop productivity, affecting seed germination as well as yield. In order to enhance tolerance of crops towards salinity, it is essential to understand the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms. In this endeavor, study of contrasting genotypes of the same species differing in their response towards salinity stress can be very useful. In the present study, we have investigated temporal differences in morphological, physiological and proteome profiles of two contrasting genotypes of rice to understand the basis of salt tolerance. When compared to IR64 rice, Pokkali, the salt-tolerant wild genotype, has enhanced capacity to cope with stress, better growth rate and possesses efficient antioxidant system, as well as better photosynthetic machinery. Our proteome studies revealed a higher and an early abundance of proteins involved in stress tolerance and photosynthesis in Pokkali in comparison with IR64, which, in contrast, showed greater changes in metabolic machinery even during early duration of stress. Our findings suggest important differences in physicochemical and proteome profiles of the two genotypes, which may be the basis of observed stress tolerance in the salt-tolerant Pokkali.
