['26546666', 'Adaptor protein (AP) complexes play critical roles in protein sorting among  different post-Golgi pathways by recognizing specific cargo protein motifs. Among  the five AP complexes (AP-1-AP-5) in plants, AP-4 is one of the most poorly  understood; the AP-4 components, AP-4 cargo motifs, and AP-4 functional mechanism  are not known. Here, we identify the AP-4 components and show that the AP-4  complex regulates receptor-mediated vacuolar protein sorting by recognizing  VACUOLAR SORTING RECEPTOR1 (VSR1), which was originally identified as a sorting  receptor for seed storage proteins to target protein storage vacuoles in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). From the vacuolar sorting mutant library  GREEN FLUORESCENT SEED (GFS), we isolated three gfs mutants that accumulate  abnormally high levels of VSR1 in seeds and designated them as gfs4, gfs5, and  gfs6. Their responsible genes encode three (AP4B, AP4M, and AP4S) of the four  subunits of the AP-4 complex, respectively, and an Arabidopsis mutant (ap4e)  lacking the fourth subunit, AP4E, also had the same phenotype. Mass spectrometry  demonstrated that these four proteins form a complex in vivo. The four mutants  showed defects in the vacuolar sorting of the major storage protein 12S  globulins, indicating a role for the AP-4 complex in vacuolar protein transport.  AP4M bound to the tyrosine-based motif of VSR1. AP4M localized at the trans-Golgi  network (TGN) subdomain that is distinct from the AP-1-localized TGN subdomain.  This study provides a novel function for the AP-4 complex in VSR1-mediated  vacuolar protein sorting at the specialized domain of the TGN.', '2016 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.00869', 'Shimada']
