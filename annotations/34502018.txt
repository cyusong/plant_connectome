Gibberellin 2-oxidase (GA2ox) plays an important role in the GA catabolic pathway and the molecular function of the <i>OsGA2ox</i> genes in plant abiotic stress tolerance remains largely unknown. In this study, we functionally characterized the rice <i>gibberellin 2-oxidase 8</i> (<i>OsGA2ox8</i>) gene. The <i>OsGA2ox8</i> protein was localized in the nucleus, cell membrane, and cytoplasm, and was induced in response to various abiotic stresses and phytohormones. The overexpression of <i>OsGA2ox8</i> significantly enhanced the osmotic stress tolerance of transgenic rice plants by increasing the number of osmotic regulators and antioxidants. <i>OsGA2ox8</i> was differentially expressed in the shoots and roots to cope with osmotic stress. The plants overexpressing <i>OsGA2ox8</i> showed reduced lengths of shoots and roots at the seedling stage, but no difference in plant height at the heading stage was observed, which may be due to the interaction of OsGA2ox8 and OsGA20ox1, implying a complex feedback regulation between GA biosynthesis and metabolism in rice. Importantly, <i>OsGA2ox8</i> was able to indirectly regulate several genes associated with the anthocyanin and flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and the jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthetic pathway, and overexpression of <i>OsGA2ox8</i> activated JA signal transduction by inhibiting the expression of jasmonate ZIM domain-containing proteins. These results provide a basis for a future understanding of the networks and respective phenotypic effects associated with <i>OsGA2ox8</i>.
