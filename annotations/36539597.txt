Plants sense a myriad of signals through cell-surface receptors to coordinate their development and environmental response. The Arabidopsis ERECTA receptor kinase regulates diverse developmental processes via perceiving multiple EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF)/EPF-LIKE peptide ligands. How the activated ERECTA protein is turned over is unknown. Here we identify two closely related plant U-box ubiquitin E3 ligases, PUB30 and PUB31, as key attenuators of ERECTA signalling for two developmental processes: inflorescence/pedicel growth and stomatal development. Loss-of-function pub30 pub31 mutant plants exhibit extreme inflorescence/pedicel elongation and reduced stomatal numbers owing to excessive ERECTA protein accumulation. Ligand activation of ERECTA leads to phosphorylation of PUB30/31 via BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 (BAK1), which acts as a coreceptor kinase and a scaffold to promote PUB30/31 to associate with and ubiquitinate ERECTA for eventual degradation. Our work highlights PUB30 and PUB31 as integral components of the ERECTA regulatory circuit that ensure optimal signalling outputs, thereby defining the role for PUB proteins in developmental signalling.
