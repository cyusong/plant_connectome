Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to adapt to fluctuating environmental nitrogen availability. However, more underlying genes regulating the response to nitrate have yet to be characterized. We report here the identification of a nitrate regulatory mutant whose mutation mapped to the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor 30 gene (CPSF30-L). In the mutant, induction of nitrate-responsive genes was inhibited independent of the ammonium conditions and was restored by expression of the wild-type 65 kDa encoded by CPSF30-L. Molecular and genetic evidence suggests that CPSF30-L works upstream of NRT1.1 and independently of NLP7 in response to nitrate. Analysis of the 3'-UTR of NRT1.1 showed that the pattern of polyadenylation sites was altered in the cpsf30 mutant. Transcriptome analysis revealed that four nitrogen-related clusters were enriched in the differentially expressed genes of the cpsf30 mutant. Nitrate uptake was decreased in the mutant along with reduced expression of the nitrate transporter/sensor gene NRT1.1, while nitrate reduction and amino acid content were enhanced in roots along with increased expression of several nitrate assimilatory genes. These findings indicate that the 65 kDa protein encoded by CPSF30-L mediates nitrate signaling in part by regulating NRT1.1 expression, thus adding an important component to the nitrate signaling network.
