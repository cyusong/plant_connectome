Activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is a universal response to stress that allows cells to quickly respond to environmental cues. Fluctuations in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> are decoded in plants by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing proteins such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). The perception of microbes results in an influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that activates numerous CDPKs responsible for propagating immune signals required for resistance against disease-causing pathogens. This review describes our current understanding of CDPK activation and regulation, and provides a comprehensive overview of CDPK-mediated immune signaling through interaction with various substrates.
