['8000425', 'Two stimuli that have been associated with nutrient remobilization in plants are  phosphate (P(i)) starvation and senescence. Little is known about how the  nutrient remobilization machinery is induced at the molecular level, but in the  case of P(i) starvation, ribonucleases are considered to play important roles in  the remobilization process. Here, the control of two closely related ribonuclease  genes of Arabidopsis, RNS1 and RNS3 is investigated. The RNS1 gene is sharply  induced during starvation for P(i), an effect specific among the major  macronutrients, whereas RNS3 transcript levels remain relatively constant. RNS1  and RNS3 produced in yeast co-migrate with Arabidopsis ribonuclease activities  that exhibit the same induction properties as the transcripts in both wild-type  plants and the pho1 mutant, which is defective in xylem loading of P(i). In  contrast to what occurs during P(i) starvation, both RNS1 and RNS3 are modestly  induced during senescence, indicating that the two stimuli could trigger  different signal transduction pathways. The characterization of RNS1, in  particular, provides an important first step towards elucidating the mechanisms  by which plants sense and respond to P(i) limitation, a prominent condition in  many soil types.', '1994 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1994.6050673.x', 'Green']
