CLE (CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION-related) peptides are systemic regulators of legume-rhizobium symbiosis that negatively control the number of nitrogen-fixing nodules. CLE peptides are produced in the root in response to rhizobia inoculation and/or nitrate treatment and are transported to the shoot where they are recognized by the CLV1-like (CLAVATA1-like) receptor kinase. As a result, a shoot-derived signaling pathway is activated that inhibits subsequent nodule development in the root. In Medicago truncatula, MtCLE35 is activated in response to rhizobia and nitrate treatment and the overexpression of this gene systemically inhibits nodulation. The inhibitory effect of MtCLE35 overexpression is dependent on the CLV1-like receptor kinase MtSUNN (SUPER NUMERIC NODULES), suggesting that MtSUNN could be involved in the reception of the MtCLE35 peptide. Yet little is known about the downstream genes regulated by a MtCLE35-activated response in the root. In order to identify genes whose expression levels could be regulated by the MtCLE35-MtSUNN pathway, we performed a MACE-Seq (Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends) transcriptomic analysis of MtCLE35-overexpressing roots. Among upregulated genes, the gene MtSUNN that encodes a putative receptor of MtCLE35 was detected. Moreover, we found that MtSUNN, as well as several other differentially expressed genes, were upregulated locally in MtCLE35-overexpressing roots whereas the MtTML1 and MtTML2 genes were upregulated systemically. Our data suggest that MtCLE35 has both local and systemic effects on target genes in the root.
