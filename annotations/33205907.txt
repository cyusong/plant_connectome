Verticillium wilt diseases caused by the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae result in devastating yield losses in many economically important crops annually. Here, we identified a novel ethylene-inducing xylanase (EIX)-like protein, VdEIX3, from V. dahliae, which exhibits immunity-inducing activity in Nicotiana benthamiana. In vitro-purified VdEIX3 can induce strong oxidative burst, activate the expression of defense-related genes, and increase resistance against oomycete and fungal pathogens in N. benthamiana. VdEIX3 orthologs of other Verticillium pathogens also induce cell death in N. benthamiana, which form a new type of EIX protein family that is distinct from the known EIX proteins. A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein, NbEIX2, regulates the perception of VdEIX3 in N. benthamiana. Our results demonstrate that VdEIX3 is a novel EIX-like protein that can be recognized by N. benthamiana NbEIX2, and also suggest that NbEIX2 is a promising receptor-like protein that is potentially applicable to transgenic breeding for improving resistance to Verticillium wilt diseases.
