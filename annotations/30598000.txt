The members of the <i>Burkholderia</i> genus are characterized by high versatility and adaptability to various ecological niches. With the availability of the genome sequences of numerous species of <i>Burkholderia</i>, many studies have been conducted to elucidate the unique features of this exceptional group of bacteria. Genomic and metabolic plasticity are common among <i>Burkholderia</i> species, as evidenced by their relatively large multi-replicon genomes that are rich in insertion sequences and genomic islands and contain a high proportion of coding regions. Such unique features could explain their adaptability to various habitats and their versatile lifestyles, which are reflected in a multiplicity of species including free-living rhizospheric bacteria, plant endosymbionts, legume nodulators, and plant pathogens. The phytopathogenic <i>Burkholderia</i> group encompasses several pathogens representing threats to important agriculture crops such as rice. Contrarily, plant-beneficial <i>Burkholderia</i> have also been reported, which have symbiotic and growth-promoting roles. In this review, the taxonomy of <i>Burkholderia</i> is discussed emphasizing the recent updates and the contributions of genomic studies to precise taxonomic positioning. Moreover, genomic and functional studies on <i>Burkholderia</i> are reviewed and insights are provided into the mechanisms underlying the virulence and benevolence of phytopathogenic and plant-beneficial <i>Burkholderia</i>, respectively, on the basis of cutting-edge knowledge.
