The plant secondary cell wall is a thickened matrix of polysaccharides and lignin deposited at the cessation of growth in some cells. It forms the majority of carbon in lignocellulosic biomass, and it is an abundant and renewable source for forage, fiber, materials, fuels, and bioproducts. The complex structure and arrangement of the cell wall polymers mean that the carbon is difficult to access in an economical and sustainable way. One solution is to alter cell wall polymer structure so that it is more suited to downstream processing. However, it remains difficult to predict what the effects of this engineering will have on the assembly, architecture and properties of the cell wall. Here, we make use of Arabidopsis plants expressing a suite of genes to increase pectic galactan chain length in the secondary cell wall. Using multi-dimensional solid-state NMR, we show that increasing galactan chain length enhances pectin-cellulose spatial contacts and increases cellulose crystallinity. We also find the increased galactan content leads to fewer spatial contacts of cellulose with xyloglucan and the backbone of pectin. Hence, we propose that the elongated galactan side chains compete with xyloglucan and the pectic backbone for cellulose interactions. Due to the galactan topology, this may result in comparatively weaker interactions and disrupts the cell wall architecture. Therefore, introduction of this strategy into trees or other bioenergy crops would benefit from cell-specific expression strategies to avoid negative effects on plant growth.
