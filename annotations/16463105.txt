A dwarf mutant glu was identified from screening of T-DNA tagged rice population. Genetic analysis of the T1 generation of glu revealed that a segregation ratio of wild-type:dwarf phenotype was 3:1, suggesting that the mutated phenotype was controlled by a single recessive nuclear locus. The mutated gene OsGLU1, identified by Tail-PCR, encodes a putative membrane-bound endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase, which is highly conserved between mono- and dicotyledonous plants. Mutation of OsGLU1 resulted in a reduction in cell elongation, and a decrease in cellulose content but an increase in pectin content, suggesting that OsGLU1 affects the internode elongation and cell wall components of rice plants. Transgenic glu mutants harboring the OsGLU1 gene complemented the mutation and displayed the wild-type phenotype. In addition, OsGLU1 RNAi plants showed similar phenotype as the glu mutant has. These results indicate that OsGLU1 plays important roles in plant cell growth. Gibberellins and brassinosteroids induced OsGLU1 expression. In rice genome, endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanases form a multiple gene family with 15 members, and each may have a distinct expression pattern in different organs. These results indicate that endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanases may play diverse roles in growth and developmental process of rice plants.
