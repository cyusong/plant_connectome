Almost 50 years ago, it was shown that gibberellin (GA) applications caused flowering in species normally responding to cold (vernalization) and long day (LD). The implication that GAs are involved with vernalization and LD responses is examined here with the grass Lolium perenne. This species has an obligatory requirement for exposure to both vernalization and LD for its flowering (inflorescence initiation). Specific effects of vernalization or LD on GA synthesis, content, and action have been documented using four treatment pairs: nonvernalized or vernalized plants exposed to short days (SDs) or LDs. Irrespective of vernalization status, exposure to two LDs increased expression of L. perenne GA 20-oxidase-1 (LpGA20ox1), a critical GA biosynthetic gene, with endogenous GAs increasing by up to 5-fold in leaf and shoot. In parallel, LD led to degradation of a DELLA protein, SLENDER (within 48 h of LD or within 2 h of GA application). There was no effect on GA catabolism or abscisic acid content. Loss of SLENDER, which is a repressor of GA signaling, confirms the physiological relevance of increased GA content in LD. For flowering, applied GA replaced the need for LD but not that for vernalization. Thus, GAs may be an LD, leaf-sourced hormonal signal for flowering of L. perenne. By contrast, vernalization had little impact on GA or SLENDER levels or on SLENDER degradation following GA application. Thus, although vernalization and GA are both required for flowering of L. perenne, GA signaling is independent of vernalization that apparently impacts on unrelated processes.
