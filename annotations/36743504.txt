The cortex-to-stele ratio (CSR), as it increases from thin- to thick-root species in angiosperms, is theorised to effectively reflect a compensation for the 'lag' of absorption behind transportation. But it is still not known if this compensatory effect exists in gymnosperm species or governs root structure and function within species. Here, anatomical, morphological, and tissue chemical traits of absorptive roots were measured in three temperate angiosperm and three gymnosperm species. Differences in the CSR and the above functional traits, as well as their intraspecific associations, were analyzed and then compared between angiosperms and gymnosperms. At the intraspecific level, the CSR decreased with increasing root order for all species. The expected functional indication of the CSR was consistent with decreases in specific root length (SRL) and N concentration and increases in the C to N ratio (C:N ratio) and the number of and total cross-sectional area of conduits with increasing root order, demonstrating that the CSR indicates the strength of absorption and transportation at the intraspecific level, but intraspecific changes are due to root development rather than the compensatory effect. These trends resulted in significant intraspecific associations between the CSR and SRL (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.36 ~ 0.80), N concentration (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.48 ~ 0.93), the C:N ratio (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.47 ~ 0.91), and the number of (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.21 ~ 0.78) and total cross-sectional area (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.29 ~ 0.72) of conduits in each species (<i>p</i>< 0.05). The overall mean CSR of absorptive roots in angiosperms was four times greater than in gymnosperms, and in angiosperms, the CSR was significantly higher in thick- than in thin-rooted species, whereas in gymnosperms, the interspecific differences were not significant (<i>p</i> > 0.05). This suggests that the compensation for the lag of absorption <i>via</i> cortex thickness regulation was stronger in three angiosperm species than in three gymnosperm species. In addition, there was poor concordance between angiosperms and gymnosperms in the relationships between CSRs and anatomical, morphological, and tissue chemical traits. However, these gymnosperm species show a more stable intraspecific functional association compared to three angiosperm species. In general, absorptive root CSRs could manifest complex strategies in resource acquisition for trees at both intra- and interspecific levels.
