The life strategy of plants includes their ability to respond quickly at the cellular level to changes in their environment. The use of targeted fluorescent protein probes and imaging of living cells has revealed several rapidly induced organelle responses that create the efficient sub-cellular machinery for maintaining homeostasis in the plant cell. Several organelles, including plastids, mitochondria, and peroxisomes, extend and retract thin tubules that have been named stromules, matrixules, and peroxules, respectively. Here, I combine all these thin tubular forms under the common head of organelle extensions. All extensions change shape continuously and in their elongated form considerably increase organelle outreach into the surrounding cytoplasm. Their pleomorphy reflects their interactions with the dynamic endoplasmic reticulum and cytoskeletal elements. Here, using foundational images and time-lapse movies, and providing salient information on some molecular and biochemically characterized mutants with increased organelle extensions, I draw attention to their common role in maintaining homeostasis in plant cells.
