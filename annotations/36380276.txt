Volatile components are important secondary metabolites essential to fruit aroma quality, thus, in the past decades many studies have been extensively performed in clarifying fruit aroma formation. However, aroma components and biosynthesis in the fruit of Binzi (Malus pumila × Malus asiatica), an old local species with attractive aroma remain unknown. We investigated two Binzi cultivars, 'Xiangbinzi' (here named high-fragrant Binzi, 'HFBZ') and 'Hulabin' (here named low-fragrant Binzi, 'LFBZ') by monitoring the variation of volatiles and their precursors by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS), as well as their related genes by RNA-seq during post-harvest ripening. We firstly confirmed that 'HFBZ' and 'LFBZ' fruit showed respiratory climacteric by detecting respiratory rate and ethylene emission during post-harvest; found that esters were the major aroma components in 'HFBZ' fruit, and hexyl 2-methylbutyrate was responsible for the 'fruity' note and most potent aroma component, followed by ethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, (E)-2-hexenal, and 1-hexanol. Regarding aroma synthesis, fatty acid metabolism seemed to be more important than amino acid metabolism for aroma synthesis in 'HFBZ' fruit. Based on RNA-seq and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), LOX2a, LOX5a, ADH1, and AAT1 genes are pointed to the LOX pathway, which may play a vital role in the aroma formation of 'HFBZ' fruit. Our study firstly investigated the aroma components and related genes of Binzi fruit, and provided an insight into the fragrant nature of Malus species.
