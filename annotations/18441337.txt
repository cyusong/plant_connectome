The expression of a gene isolated from cDNA differential screening and encoding a lipid transfer protein, designated as SsLTP1, was analysed at the protein level in two groups of Solanum species and lines differing in cold acclimation capacity. Under control conditions, the SsLTP1 was localized in all aerial organs of S. sogarandinum and S. tuberosum plants. Western analysis of subcellular extracts indicated that the protein possesses an intracellular localization. The protein abundance was found to vary as a function of organ type, the highest levels being observed in flowers, stems, and young leaves. During low temperature treatment, no change in protein level was noticed in either the S. tuberosum cv. Irga, which displays a low capacity for cold acclimation, or in a S. sogarandinum line which has lost its cold acclimation capacity. By contrast, low temperature induced a noticeable increase in SsLTP1 level in stems and leaves of S. sogarandinum and S. tuberosum cv. Ursus plants, which are able to acclimate to cold, indicating that SsLTP1 could participate in the processes leading to freezing tolerance. In other respects, SsLTP1 accumulation was observed both in cold-acclimating and in non-acclimating Solanum species when subjected to water deficit or to salt treatment. These data indicate that SsLTP1 gene expression is regulated in an organ-dependent manner and through distinct pathways under non-freezing low temperature and during osmotic treatments.
