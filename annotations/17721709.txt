Aluminium (Al) toxicity is a primary cause of low rice productivity in acid soils. We have mapped a number of quantitative-trait loci (QTL) controlling Al tolerance in a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the tolerant japonica cultivar Asominori and the sensitive indica cultivar IR24. Tolerance was assessed on the basis of relative root elongation. QTL were detected on chromosomes 1, 9, and 11, with the percentages of phenotypic variance explained ranging from 13.5 to 17.7%. Alleles from Asominori at all three QTL were associated with increased Al tolerance. qRRE-9 is expressed both in the genetic background of IR24 and in an Asominori/IR24-mixed background. qRRE-9 was reduced to the single recessive Mendelian factor Alt-9. High-resolution genetic and physical maps were constructed for Alt-9 in a BC(3)F(2) population of 1,043 individuals. Alt-9 maps between RM24702 and ID47-2 on chromosome 9, and co-segregates with RM5765.
