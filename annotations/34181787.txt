['34181787', 'The oomycete Albugo candida causes white rust of Brassicaceae, including  vegetable and oilseed crops, and wild relatives such as Arabidopsis thaliana.  Novel White Rust Resistance (WRR) genes from Arabidopsis enable new insights into  plant/parasite co-evolution. WRR4A from Arabidopsis accession Columbia (Col-0)  provides resistance to many but not all white rust races, and encodes a  nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat immune receptor. Col-0 WRR4A resistance  is broken by AcEx1, an isolate of A. candida. We identified an allele of WRR4A in  Arabidopsis accession Oystese-0 (Oy-0) and other accessions that confers full  resistance to AcEx1. WRR4A(Oy-0) carries a C-terminal extension required for  recognition of AcEx1, but reduces recognition of several effectors recognized by  the WRR4A(Col-0) allele. WRR4A(Oy-0) confers full resistance to AcEx1 when  expressed in the oilseed crop Camelina sativa.', '2021 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.15396', 'ORCID:']
