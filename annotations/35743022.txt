Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) belong to a family of glycoproteins that are widely present in plants. AGPs are mostly composed of a protein backbone decorated with complex carbohydrate side chains and are usually anchored to the plasma membrane or secreted extracellularly. A trickle of compelling biochemical and genetic evidence has demonstrated that AGPs make exciting candidates for a multitude of vital activities related to plant growth and development. However, because of the diversity of AGPs, functional redundancy of AGP family members, and blunt-force research tools, the precise functions of AGPs and their mechanisms of action remain elusive. In this review, we put together the current knowledge about the characteristics, classification, and identification of AGPs and make a summary of the biological functions of AGPs in multiple phases of plant reproduction and developmental processes. In addition, we especially discuss deeply the potential mechanisms for AGP action in different biological processes via their impacts on cellulose synthesis and deposition based on previous studies. Particularly, five hypothetical models that may explain the AGP involvement in cellulose synthesis and deposition during plant cell wall biogenesis are proposed. AGPs open a new avenue for understanding cellulose synthesis and deposition in plants.
