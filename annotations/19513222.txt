There are two major modes for plant recognition of biotrophic microbial pathogens. In one mode, plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize microbe associated molecular patterns (MAMPs, also called PAMPs), which are molecules such as flg22, a fragment of bacterial flagellin. In the other mode, the products of plant resistance (R) genes recognize pathogen effectors or host proteins modified by effectors. Salicylic acid (SA) -mediated defense responses are an important part of R gene-mediated resistance. It was not clear how these two signaling mechanisms interact with each other. Recently, we reported that treatment with flg22 triggered SA accumulation in Arabidopsis leaves. Disruptions of SA signaling components strongly affected MAMP-triggered gene expression responses. Flg22-triggered resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000) was partly dependent on SA signaling. Our results demonstrated the importance of SA signaling in flg22-triggered resistance and, at the same time, the importance of some other signaling mechanism(s) in this resistance. Here we discuss potential signaling components of flg22-triggered SA accumulation and other signaling mechanisms potentially contributing to flg22-triggered resistance to Pst DC3000.
