Ovule development in Arabidopsis thaliana involves pattern formation, which ensures that ovules are regularly arranged in the pistils to reduce competition for nutrients and space. Mechanisms underlying pattern formation in plants, such as phyllotaxis, flower morphogenesis, or lateral root initiation, have been extensively studied, and genes controlling the initiation of ovules have been identified. However, the fundamental patterning mechanism that determines the spacing of ovule anlagen within the placenta remained unexplored. Using natural variation analysis combined with quantitative trait locus analysis, we found that the spacing of ovules in the developing gynoecium and fruits is controlled by two secreted peptides, EPFL2 and EPFL9 (also known as Stomagen), and their receptors from the ERECTA (ER) family that act from the carpel wall and the placental tissue. We found that a signaling pathway controlled by EPFL9 acting from the carpel wall through the LRR-receptor kinases ER, ERL1, and ERL2 promotes fruit growth. Regular spacing of ovules depends on EPFL2 expression in the carpel wall and in the inter-ovule spaces, where it acts through ERL1 and ERL2. Loss of EPFL2 signaling results in shorter gynoecia and fruits and irregular spacing of ovules or even ovule twinning. We propose that the EPFL2 signaling module evolved to control the initiation and regular, equidistant spacing of ovule primordia, which may serve to minimize competition between seeds or facilitate equal resource allocation. Together, EPFL2 and EPFL9 help to coordinate ovule patterning and thereby seed number with gynoecium and fruit growth through a set of shared receptors.
