['23268445', 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that have important regulatory roles  in numerous developmental and metabolic processes in most eukaryotes. In  Arabidopsis, DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1, SERRATE, HUA ENHANCER1 and  HASTY are involved in processing of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) to yield  precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and eventually miRNAs. In addition to these  components, mRNA cap-binding proteins, CBP80/ABA HYPERSENSITIVE1 and CBP20, also  participate in miRNA biogenesis. Here, we show that STABILIZED1 (STA1), an  Arabidopsis pre-mRNA processing factor 6 homolog, is also involved in the  biogenesis of miRNAs. Similar to other miRNA biogenesis-defective mutants, sta1-1  accumulated significantly lower levels of mature miRNAs and concurrently higher  levels of pri-miRNAs than wild type. The dramatic reductions of mature miRNAs  were associated with the accumulation of their target gene transcripts and  developmental defects. Furthermore, sta1-1 impaired splicing of intron containing  pri-miRNAs and decreased transcript levels of DCL1. These results suggest that  STA1 is involved in miRNA biogenesis directly by functioning in pri-miRNA  splicing and indirectly by modulating the DCL1 transcript level.', '2013 Feb 1', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gks1309', 'Lee']
