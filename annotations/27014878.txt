['27014878', 'Asymmetric division of zygote is critical for pattern formation during early  embryogenesis in plants and animals. It requires integration of the intrinsic and  extrinsic cues prior to and/or after fertilization. How these cues are translated  into developmental signals is poorly understood. Here through genetic screen for  mutations affecting early embryogenesis, we identified an Arabidopsis mutant,  zygotic arrest 1 (zar1), in which zygote asymmetric division and the cell fate of  its daughter cells were impaired. ZAR1 encodes a member of the RLK/Pelle kinase  family. We demonstrated that ZAR1 physically interacts with Calmodulin and the  heterotrimeric G protein Gbeta, and ZAR1 kinase is activated by their binding as  well. ZAR1 is specifically expressed micropylarly in the embryo sac at  eight-nucleate stage and then in central cell, egg cell and synergids in the  mature embryo sac. After fertilization, ZAR1 is accumulated in zygote and  endosperm. The disruption of ZAR1 and AGB1 results in short basal cell and an  apical cell with basal cell fate. These data suggest that ZAR1 functions as a  membrane integrator for extrinsic cues, Ca2+ signal and G protein signaling to  regulate the division of zygote and the cell fate of its daughter cells in  Arabidopsis.', '2016 Mar', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1005933', 'Yang']
