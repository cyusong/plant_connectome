Various pathogenic species are capable of penetrating plant leaves through stomata on the leaf surface for propagation by absorbing nutrients in plant interiors. Plants have evolved abilities to close stomata to restrict pathogen infections. The model plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) closes stomata when FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2), a receptor protein localized in the plasma membrane (PM) of stomatal guard cells, detects flagellin, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) derived from the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. It currently remains largely unknown how flagellin-FLS2 signaling initiates stomatal closure. Our previous studies showed that PAMP-INDUCED PEPTIDE1 (PIP1), an <i>Arabidopsis</i> endogenous peptide, activates immune responses through a PM-localized receptor, RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE7 (RLK7). Here, we demonstrate that PIP1-RLK7 act downstream of FLS2 to activate stomatal immunity against the bacterial strain <i>Pseudomonas syringe</i> pv. tomato (<i>Pst</i>) DC3118. PIP1 promotes the expression of genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis. SA contributes to the expression of PIP1 preligand prePIP1 and the PIP1-induced stomatal closure. In contrast, methl jasmonate (MJ) and a pathogen-derived jasmonate mimic coronatine (COR) performs an opposite function of SA. SA also promotes the PIP1-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which is required for PIP1-induced stomatal closure. Overall, PIP1 and SA may form a positive feedback loop to regulate ROS-mediated stomatal immunity in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
