The involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in exogenous melatonin (MT)-induced isoflavone accumulation and growth improvement in NaCl-stressed soybeans was investigated in this study. The results demonstrated that MT increased the activity of nitrate reductase (NR) and upregulated the relative expression of NR1, NR2, and nitric oxide synthase1, which subsequently led to an increase in NO content. MT and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, as an NO donor) markedly increased isoflavone content by enhancing the activities of cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), and by upregulating gene expression of C4H, Isoflavone synthase, PAL, and Chalcone isomerase 1A, which are involved in isoflavone biosynthesis. Moreover, MT, as well as SNP, improved the growth and biomass of NaCl-treated soybeans by increasing the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase, and reducing the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> in soybeans under NaCl stress. These MT-induced responses were entirely reversed by the supply of 4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO, a specific scavenger of NO), which in turn considerably decreased endogenous NO content. These results suggest that NO acts as an important downstream signal molecule, mediating MT-induced isoflavone accumulation and growth improvement in NaCl-stressed soybeans.
