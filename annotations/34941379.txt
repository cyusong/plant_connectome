Beneficial rhizobacteria can stimulate changes in plant root development. Although root system growth is mediated by multiple factors, the regulated distribution of the phytohormone auxin within root tissues plays a principal role. Auxin transport facilitators help to generate the auxin gradients and maxima that determine root structure. Here, we show that the plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterial strain <i>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</i> IRAT FA3 influences specific auxin efflux transporters to alter <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> root morphology. Gene expression profiling of host transcripts in control and <i>B. japonicum</i>-inoculated roots of the wild-type <i>A. thaliana</i> accession Col-0 confirmed upregulation of <i>PIN2</i>, <i>PIN3</i>, <i>PIN7</i>, and <i>ABCB19</i> with <i>B. japonicum</i> and identified genes potentially contributing to a diverse array of auxin-related responses. Cocultivation of the bacterium with loss-of-function auxin efflux transport mutants revealed that <i>B. japonicum</i> requires <i>PIN3</i>, <i>PIN7</i>, and <i>ABCB19</i> to increase lateral root development and utilizes <i>PIN2</i> to reduce primary root length. Accelerated lateral root primordia production due to <i>B. japonicum</i> was not observed in single <i>pin3</i>, <i>pin7</i>, or <i>abcb19</i> mutants, suggesting independent roles for <i>PIN3</i>, <i>PIN7</i>, and <i>ABCB19</i> during the plant-microbe interaction. Our work demonstrates <i>B. japonicum</i>'s influence over host transcriptional reprogramming during plant interaction with this beneficial microbe and the subsequent alterations to root system architecture.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
