['18287486', 'Metallothioneins (MTs) are small cysteine-rich proteins found in various  eukaryotes. Plant MTs are classified into four types based on the arrangement of  cysteine residues. To determine whether all four types of plant MTs function as  metal chelators, six Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) MTs (MT1a, MT2a, MT2b,  MT3, MT4a, and MT4b) were expressed in the copper (Cu)- and zinc (Zn)-sensitive  yeast mutants, Deltacup1 and Deltazrc1 Deltacot1, respectively. All four types of  Arabidopsis MTs provided similar levels of Cu tolerance and accumulation to the  Deltacup1 mutant. The type-4 MTs (MT4a and MT4b) conferred greater Zn tolerance  and higher accumulation of Zn than other MTs to the Deltazrc1 Deltacot1 mutant.  To examine the functions of MTs in plants, we studied Arabidopsis plants that  lack MT1a and MT2b, two MTs that are expressed in phloem. The lack of MT1a, but  not MT2b, led to a 30% decrease in Cu accumulation in roots of plants exposed to  30 mum CuSO(4). Ectopic expression of MT1a RNA in the mt1a-2 mt2b-1 mutant  restored Cu accumulation in roots. The mt1a-2 mt2b-1 mutant had normal metal  tolerance. However, when MT deficiency was combined with phytochelatin  deficiency, growth of the mt1a-2 mt2b-1 cad1-3 triple mutant was more sensitive  to Cu and cadmium compared to the cad1-3 mutant. Together these results provide  direct evidence for functional contributions of MTs to plant metal homeostasis.  MT1a, in particular, plays a role in Cu homeostasis in the roots under elevated  Cu. Moreover, MTs and phytochelatins function cooperatively to protect plants  from Cu and cadmium toxicity.', '2008 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.115782', 'Goldsbrough']
