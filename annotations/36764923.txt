Several plant species have been reported to inhibit nitrification via their root exudates, the so-called biological nitrification inhibition (BNI). Given the potential of BNI-producing plants to sustainably mitigate N losses in agrosystems, identification of BNI activity in existing germplasms is of paramount importance. A hydroponic system was combined with an optimized Nitrosomonas europaea-based bioassay to determine the BNI activity of root exudates. The pipeline allows collecting and processing hundreds of root exudates simultaneously. An additional assay was established to assess the potential bactericide effect of the root exudates. The pipeline was used to unravel the impact of developmental stage, temperature and osmotic stress on the BNI trait in selected wheat genotypes. Biological nitrification inhibition activity appeared consistently higher in wheat at the pretillering stage as compared to the tillering stage. While low-temperatures did not alter BNI activities in root exudates, osmotic stress appeared to change the BNI activity in a genotype-dependent manner. Further analysis of Nitrosomonas culture after pre-exposure to root exudates suggested that BNI activity has no or limited bactericide effects. The present pipeline will be instrumental to further investigating the dynamics of BNI activity and to uncover the diversity of the BNI trait in plant species.

Root exudates: !inhibit! Nitrification 
Developmental stage: !affects! BNI activity 
Temperature: !does not affect! BNI activity 
Osmotic stress: !alters! BNI activity 
BNI activity: !has no or limited! Bactericide effects
