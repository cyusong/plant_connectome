['12681508', 'The F(O) portion of the mitochondrial ATP synthase contains a range of different  subunits in bacteria, yeast and mammals. A search of the Arabidopsis genome  identified sequence orthologs for only some of these subunits. Blue native  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation of Arabidopsis mitochondrial  respiratory chain complexes revealed intact F(1)F(O), and separated F(1) and F(O)  components. The subunits of each complex were analysed by mass spectrometry and  matched to Arabidopsis genes. In the F(1)F(O) complex a series of nine known  subunits were identified along with two additional proteins matching the  predicted products of the mitochondrial encoded orfB and orf25 genes. The F(1)  complex contained the five well-characterised F(1) subunits, while four subunits  in the F(O) complex were identified: subunit 9, d subunit, and the orfB and orf25  products. Previously, orfB has been suggested as the plant equivalent of subunit  8 based on structural and sequence similarity. We propose that orf25 is the plant  b subunit based on structural similarity and its presence in the F(O) complex.  Chimerics of orf25, orfB, subunit 9 and subunit 6 have been associated with  cytoplasmic male sterility in a variety of plant species, our additional findings  now place all these proteins in the same protein complex.', '2003 Apr 10', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(03)00264-3', 'Millar']
