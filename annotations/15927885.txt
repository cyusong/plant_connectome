['15927885', 'A synthetic gene specifying the catalytic domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana  riboflavin synthase was expressed with high efficiency in a recombinant  Escherichia coli strain. The recombinant pseudomature protein was shown to  convert 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine into riboflavin at a rate of 0.027 s-1 at  25 degrees C. The protein sediments at a rate of 3.9 S. Sedimentation equilibrium  analysis afforded a molecular mass of 67.5 kDa, indicating a homotrimeric  structure, analogous to the riboflavin synthases of Eubacteria and fungi. The  protein binds its product riboflavin with relatively high affinity (Kd =1.1  microM). Product inhibition results in a characteristic sigmoidal velocity versus  substrate concentration relationship. Characterization of the enzyme/product  complex by circular dichroism and UV absorbance spectroscopy revealed a shift of  the absorption maxima of riboflavin from 370 and 445 to 399 and 465 nm,  respectively. Complete or partial sequences for riboflavin synthase orthologs  were analyzed from 11 plant species. In each case for which the complete plant  gene sequence was available, the catalytic domain was preceded by a sequence of  1-72 amino acid residues believed to function as plastid targeting signals.  Comparison of all available riboflavin synthase sequences indicates that  hypothetical gene duplication conducive to the two-domain architecture occurred  very early in evolution.', '2005 May', 'Biol Chem', '10.1515/BC.2005.050', 'Bacher']
