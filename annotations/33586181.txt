Cellular calcium (Ca) transients are endogenous signals involved in local and systemic signaling and defense activation upon environmental stress, including wounding and herbivory. Still, not all Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels contributing to the signaling have been identified, nor are their modes of action fully known. Plant annexins are proteins capable of binding to anionic phospholipids and can exhibit Ca channel-like activity. Arabidopsis ANNEXIN1 (ANN1) is suggested to contribute to Ca transport. Here, we report that wounding and simulated-herbivory-induced cytosolic free Ca elevation was impaired in systemic leaves in ann1 loss-of-function plants. We provide evidence for a role of ANN1 in local and systemic defense of plants attacked by herbivorous Spodoptera littoralis larvae. Bioassays identified ANN1 as a positive defense regulator. Spodoptera littoralis feeding on ann1 gained significantly more weight than larvae feeding on wild-type, whereas those feeding on ANN1-overexpressing lines gained less weight. Herbivory and wounding both induced defense-related responses on treated leaves, such as jasmonate accumulation and defense gene expression. These responses remained local and were strongly reduced in systemic leaves in ann1 plants. Our results indicate that ANN1 plays an important role in activation of systemic rather than local defense in plants attacked by herbivorous insects.
