Self-incompatibility alleles (S-alleles), which prevent self-fertilisation in plants, have historically been expected to benefit from negative frequency-dependent selection and invade when introduced to a new population through gene flow. However, the most taxonomically widespread form of self-incompatibility, the ribonuclease-based system ancestral to the core eudicots, functions through collaborative non-self recognition, which can affect both short-term patterns of gene flow and the long-term process of S-allele diversification. We analysed a model of S-allele evolution in two populations connected by migration, focussing on comparisons among the fates of S-alleles initially unique to each population and those shared among populations. We found that both shared and unique S-alleles from the population with more unique S-alleles were usually fitter compared with S-alleles from the population with fewer S-alleles. Resident S-alleles often became extinct and were replaced by migrant S-alleles, although this outcome could be averted by pollen limitation or biased migration. Collaborative non-self recognition will usually either result in the whole-sale replacement of S-alleles from one population with those from another or else disfavour introgression of S-alleles altogether.
