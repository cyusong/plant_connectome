C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is nature's response to CO<sub>2</sub> limitations, and evolved recurrently in several groups of plants. To identify genes related to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, Huang et al. looked for evidence of past episodes of adaptive evolution in the genomes of C<sub>4</sub> grasses. They identified a large number of candidate genes that evolved under divergent selection, indicating that, besides alterations to expression patterns, the history of C<sub>4</sub> involved strong selection on protein-coding sequences.
