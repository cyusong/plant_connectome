Cryptochrome (CRY) is a blue light receptor that is widely distributed in animals, plants, and microorganisms. <i>CRY</i> as a coding gene of cryptochrome that regulates the organism gene expression and plays an important role in organism growth and development. In this study, we identified four photolyase/cryptochrome (PHR/CRY) members from the genome of <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the Ginkgo PHR/CRY family members were closely related to <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>. We isolated a cryptochrome gene, <i>GbCRY1</i>, from <i>G. biloba</i> and analyzed its structure and function. <i>GbCRY1</i> shared high similarity with <i>AtCRY1</i> from <i>A. thaliana. GbCRY1</i> expression level was higher in stems and leaves and lower in roots, male strobili, female strobili. <i>GbCRY1</i> expression level fluctuated periodically within 24 h, gradually increased in the dark, and decreased under blue light. The newly germinated ginkgo seedlings were cultured under dark, white light, and blue light conditions. The blue light normally induced photomorphogenesis of ginkgo seedlings, which included hypocotyl elongation inhibition, leaf expansion inhibition, and chlorophyll formation. Treating dark-adapted ginkgo leaves with blue light could induce stomatal opening. At the same time, blue light reduced the expression level of <i>GbCRY1</i> in the process of inducing photomorphogenesis and stoma opening. Our results provide evidence that <i>GbCRY1</i> expression is affected by space, circadian cycle and light, and also proves that <i>GbCRY1</i> is related to ginkgo circadian clock, photomorphogenesis and stoma opening process.
