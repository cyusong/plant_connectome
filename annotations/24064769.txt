Numerous endogenous and environmental signals regulate the intricate and highly orchestrated process of plant senescence. Ethylene is a well-known inducer of senescence, including fruit ripening and flower and leaf senescence. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of ethylene-induced leaf senescence remains to be elucidated. Here, we examine ethylene-insensitive3 (EIN3), a key transcription factor in ethylene signaling, and find that EIN3 is a functional senescence-associated gene. Constitutive overexpression or temporary activation of EIN3 is sufficient to accelerate leaf senescence symptoms. Conversely, loss of EIN3 and EIN3-Like1 (its close homolog) function leads to a delay in age-dependent and ethylene-, jasmonic acid-, or dark-induced leaf senescence. We further found that EIN3 acts downstream of ORESARA2 (ORE2)/ORE3/EIN2 to repress miR164 transcription and upregulate the transcript levels of ORE1/NAC2, a target gene of miR164. EIN3 directly binds to the promoters of microRNA164 (miR164), and this binding activity progressively increases during leaf ageing. Genetic analysis revealed that overexpression of miR164 or knockout of ORE1/NAC2 represses EIN3-induced early-senescence phenotypes. Collectively, our study defines a continuation of the signaling pathway involving EIN2-EIN3-miR164-NAC2 in regulating leaf senescence and provides a mechanistic insight into how ethylene promotes the progression of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana.
