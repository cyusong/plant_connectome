A characteristic feature of a plant immune response is the increase of the cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) concentration following infection, which results in the downstream activation of immune response regulators. The bryophyte <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> has been shown to mount an immune response when exposed to bacteria, fungi, or chitin elicitation, in a manner similar to the one observed in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Nevertheless, whether the response of <i>P. patens</i> to microorganism exposure is Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediated is currently unknown. Here, we show that <i>P. patens</i> plants treated with chitin oligosaccharides exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, and that a calcium ionophore can stimulate the expression of defense-related genes. Treatment with chitin oligosaccharides also results in an inhibition of growth, which can be explained by the depolymerization of the apical actin cytoskeleton of tip growing cells. These results suggest that chitin-triggered calcium oscillations are conserved and were likely present in the common ancestor of bryophytes and vascular plants.
