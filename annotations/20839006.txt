The Arabidopsis genome encodes six members of microRNA395 (miR395) family previously determined to regulate the expression of ATP sulfurylase (APS) and the sulfate transporter SULTR2;1. However, the mRNA targets for the individual miR395 family members and the biological consequences produced by target gene regulation of each miR395 remain to be identified. In this study, a transgenic approach was employed to determine the mRNA targets for each miR395 family member as well as the role each member plays in plant growth under abiotic stress conditions. Overexpression of miR395c or miR395e retarded and accelerated, respectively, the seed germination of Arabidopsis under high salt or dehydration stress conditions. Despite a single nucleotide difference between miR395c and miR395e, the cleavage of mRNA targets, APS1, APS3, APS4 and SULTR2;1, was not same in miR395c- and miR395e-overexpressing plants. These results demonstrate that a given miRNA family containing a single nucleotide difference can guide the cleavage of various mRNA targets, thereby acting as a positive or negative regulator of seed germination under stress.
