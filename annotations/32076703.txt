The class of conjugating green algae, Zygnematophyceae (Conjugatophyceae), is extremely rich in species and has attracted the interest of phycologists for a long time. It is now widely accepted that this class of charophyte algae holds a key position in the phylogenetic tree of streptophytes, where they represent the closest relatives to all land plants (embryophytes). It is increasingly evident that robust model plants that can be easily cultivated and genetically transformed are necessary to better understand the process of terrestrialization and the related molecular, cellular, and physiological adaptations. Living algae collections play an important role, not only for phylogenomic-based taxonomy but also for screening for suitable model organisms. For this review, we screened six major public algae collections for Zygnematophyceae strains and established a cumulative list comprising 738 different taxa (including species, subspecies, varieties, and forms). From the described biodiversity with 8883 registered taxa (AlgaeBase) the cultured Zygnematophyceae taxa worldwide cover only ~8.3%. We review the past research on this clade of algae and discuss it from the perspective of establishing a model organism. We present data on the life cycle of the genera Micrasterias and Spirogyra, representing the orders Desmidiales and Zygnematales, and outline the current status of genetic transformation of Zygnematophyceae algae and future research perspectives.
