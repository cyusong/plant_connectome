Auxin is a master regulator of root growth by modulating its development under the constantly changing environment. Recently, an antagonistic interaction was suggested between SA and IAA signaling. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to analyze and compare the effect of the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) signaling inhibitor p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB) and salicylic acid (SA) as a potential IAA signaling inhibitor on the root growth, enzyme activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in Cd- and IAA-treated barley root tips. Exposure of plants to Cd resulted in a more than threefold increase of IAA content in the root apex even 3h after the treatment. In addition, exogenously applied IAA evoked root responses such as root growth inhibition and swelling, ROS generation and activation of lipoxygenase or glutathione peroxidase identical to those induced by Cd. Furthermore, both Cd- and IAA-induced stress responses were markedly reversed by PCIB or SA post-treatment. Similarly to PCIB, SA did not affect the IAA content of root tips, suggesting the action of SA on the IAA signaling pathway in barley roots. SA probably does not alleviate the Cd toxicity in roots, but rather prevents or partially inhibits the root defense response to the presence of Cd through the inhibition of Cd-induced IAA-mediated ROS generation in roots.
