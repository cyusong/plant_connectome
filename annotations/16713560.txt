Plants rely heavily on environmental cues to control the timing of developmental transitions. We are beginning to better understand what determines the timing of two of these transitions, the switch from juvenile to adult vegetative development and the transition to flowering. In this review, we discuss how RNA silencing mechanisms may influence the juvenile-to-adult vegetative switch. We also describe the discovery and regulation of a component of "florigen," the mobile flowering promotion signal that is involved in the transition to flowering. Parallel themes are beginning to emerge from a molecular comparison of these two developmental transitions.

RNA silencing mechanisms: !influence! juvenile-to-adult vegetative switch
component of "florigen": !involved in! transition to flowering
molecular comparison: !parallels themes! between two developmental transitions
