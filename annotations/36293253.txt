Anthocyanins are an important group of water-soluble and non-toxic natural pigments with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can be found in flowers, vegetables, and fruits. Anthocyanin biosynthesis is regulated by several different types of transcription factors, including the WD40-repeat protein Transparent Testa Glabra 1 (TTG1), the bHLH transcription factor Transparent Testa 8 (TT8), Glabra3 (GL3), Enhancer of GL3 (EGL3), and the R2R3 MYB transcription factor Production of Anthocyanin Pigment 1 (PAP1), PAP2, MYB113, and MYB114, which are able to form MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complexes to regulate the expression of late biosynthesis genes (LBGs) in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Nasturtium (<i>Tropaeolum majus</i>) is an edible flower plant that offers many health benefits, as it contains numerous medicinally important ingredients, including anthocyanins. By a comparative examination of the possible anthocyanin biosynthesis regulator genes in nasturtium varieties with different anthocyanin contents, we found that <i>TmPAP2</i>, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene, is highly expressed in "Empress of India", a nasturtium variety with high anthocyanin content, while the expression of <i>TmPAP2</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> led to the overproduction of anthocyanins. Protoplast transfection shows that TmPAP2 functions as a transcription activator; consistent with this finding, some of the biosynthesis genes in the general phenylpropanoid pathway and anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway were highly expressed in "Empress of India" and the <i>35S:TmPAP2</i> transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants. However, protoplast transfection indicates that TmPAP2 may not be able to form an MBW complex with TmGL3 and TmTTG1. These results suggest that TmPAP2 may function alone as a key regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in nasturtiums.
