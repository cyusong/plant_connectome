['26243618', 'Abiotic stresses, such as salinity, cause global yield loss of all major crop  plants. Factors and mechanisms that can aid in plant breeding for salt stress  tolerance are therefore of great importance for food and feed production. Here,  we identified a MYB-like transcription factor, Salt-Related MYB1 (SRM1), that  negatively affects Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed germination under  saline conditions by regulating the levels of the stress hormone abscisic acid  (ABA). Accordingly, several ABA biosynthesis and signaling genes act directly  downstream of SRM1, including SALT TOLERANT1/NINE-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID  DIOXYGENASE3, RESPONSIVE TO DESICCATION26, and Arabidopsis NAC DOMAIN CONTAINING  PROTEIN19. Furthermore, SRM1 impacts vegetative growth and leaf shape. We show  that SRM1 is an important transcriptional regulator that directly targets ABA  biosynthesis and signaling-related genes and therefore may be regarded as an  important regulator of ABA-mediated salt stress tolerance.', '2015 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.00962', 'ORCID:']
