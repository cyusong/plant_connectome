Transcriptional co-activators of the multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBF1) type belong to a small multigenic family that controls gene expression by connecting transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery. In this report, a triple knock-down mutant (abc-) for the Arabidopsis thaliana MBF1 genes AtMBF1a, AtMBF1b and AtMBF1c was generated. The phenotypic characterization using oxidative agents such as hydrogen peroxide and methyl viologen revealed that the abc- mutant was more sensitive to oxidative stress. The triple knock-down mutant, abc- was also sensitive to osmotic stress mediated by high concentrations of sorbitol. Furthermore, the abc- phenotype was partially or completely rescued by AtMBF1c cDNA over-expression (abc- +c) depending on physiological and developmental conditions. AtMBF1s regulate the expression of ABR1, which is a member of the ethylene-response factor family and acts as ABA repressor. Thus, we conclude that AtMBF1 gene family may function as a regulatory component of the cross-talk node between ethylene, ABA and stress signal pathways. Furthermore, higher levels of a HSP70 mRNA and an immunoreactive HSP70 protein were detected in the abc- mutant. The participation of MBF1c as a possible negative regulator of HSP genes was discussed.
