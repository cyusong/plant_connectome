Since its initial discovery as a high affinity Ca ( 2+) -binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), calreticulin (CRT) has been documented to be a multifunctional protein in both animal and plant cells. This protein is well recognized as a Ca ( 2+) -binding molecular chaperone that facilitates the folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins and regulates the Ca ( 2+) homeostasis in the ER lumen. However, functional relevance associated with its localization in other cellular compartments has also been reported. Recent studies suggest that both isoforms of plant CRTs (AtCRT1/2 and AtCRT3) are involved in regulating plant defense against biotrophic pathogens. Here we discuss the cellular functions of CRT and its connection to the emerging functions of AtCRTs in plant immunity.
