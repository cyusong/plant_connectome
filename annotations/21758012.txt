Membrane-tethered transcription factors (MTTFs) are proteins that are targeted to membranes and are capable of regulating gene expression. In this way, they are physically restrained from entering the nucleus and are innately dormant. Upon specific signal recognition cues, MTTFs are activated through cleavage by a protease that releases the transcription factor domain into the cytosol thus allowing it to translocate to the nucleus where it can regulate gene expression. MTTFs are classically thought to provide an advantage to an organism by allowing for rapid signal transduction in response to cellular and environmental stresses. However, recent findings suggest that MTTFs may not only act as a means to respond quickly to stress but also are able to regulate developmental pathways, illustrating a point of interaction between stress and development.
