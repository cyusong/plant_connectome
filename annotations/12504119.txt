['12504119', 'We have previously identified a cis-acting element, named the XXIII box, that is  essential for light-regulated expression of the nuclear gene GAPB, which encodes  the B subunit of chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from  Arabidopsis thaliana. Examination of the sequences indicated that there are two  GATA motifs within the XXIII box. Based on the degree of the amino-acid sequence  identity in the DNA binding domains, we divided the 25 GATA factors encoded in  the Arabidopsis genome into three classes. We chose GATA-1 and GATA-20 from Class  I and Class II, which include the majority of GATA factors, for overexpression in  an Escherichia coli expression system. Gel mobility shift assays showed that  GATA-1, but not GATA-20, binds specifically to the two GATA motifs within the  XXIII fragment. In addition, we showed that GATA-1 could also bind specifically  to a cis-acting element in the promoter of the GAPA gene, which is coordinately  regulated by light with the GAPB gene. Based on these results, we propose that  light controls the expression of GAPA and GAPB genes in part by regulating the  binding of the same transcription factor at their GATA motifs.', '2003 Jan 10', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02892-9', 'Shih']
