The differential distribution of the plant signaling molecule auxin is required for many aspects of plant development. Local auxin maxima and gradients arise as a result of local auxin metabolism and, predominantly, from directional cell-to-cell transport. In this primer, we discuss how the coordinated activity of several auxin influx and efflux systems, which transport auxin across the plasma membrane, mediates directional auxin flow. This activity crucially contributes to the correct setting of developmental cues in embryogenesis, organogenesis, vascular tissue formation and directional growth in response to environmental stimuli.
