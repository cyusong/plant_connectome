Many glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (GR-RBPs) have critical functions in RNA processing and metabolism. Here, we describe a role for the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) GR-RBP SlRBP1 in regulating mRNA translation. We found that SlRBP1 knockdown mutants (slrbp1) displayed reduced accumulation of total chlorophyll and impaired chloroplast ultrastructure. These phenotypes were accompanied by deregulation of the levels of numerous key transcripts associated with chloroplast functions in slrbp1. Furthermore, native RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (nRIP-seq) recovered 61 SlRBP1-associated RNAs, most of which are involved in photosynthesis. SlRBP1 binding to selected target RNAs was validated by nRIP-qPCR. Intriguingly, the accumulation of proteins encoded by SlRBP1-bound transcripts, but not the mRNAs themselves, was reduced in slrbp1 mutants. Polysome profiling followed by RT-qPCR assays indicated that the polysome occupancy of target RNAs was lower in slrbp1 plants than in wild-type. Furthermore, SlRBP1 interacted with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor SleIF4A2. Silencing of SlRBP1 significantly reduced SleIF4A2 binding to SlRBP1-target RNAs. Taking these observations together, we propose that SlRBP1 binds to and channels RNAs onto the SleIF4A2 translation initiation complex and promotes the translation of its target RNAs to regulate chloroplast functions.
