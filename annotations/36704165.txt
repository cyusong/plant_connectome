Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) population is an ideal genetic and breeding material for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and molecular breeding. In this study, a MAGIC population derived from eight tobacco parents was developed. Eight parents and 560 homozygous lines were genotyped by a 430K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip assay and phenotyped for nicotine content under different conditions. Four QTLs associated with nicotine content were detected by genome-wide association mapping (GWAS), and one major QTL, named <i>qNIC7-1</i>, was mapped repeatedly under different conditions. Furthermore, by combining forward mapping, bioinformatics analysis and gene editing, we identified an ethylene response factor (ERF) transcription factor as a candidate gene underlying the major QTL <i>qNIC7-1</i> for nicotine content in tobacco. A presence/absence variation (PAV) at <i>qNIC7-1</i> confers changes in nicotine content. Overall, the large size of this MAGIC population, diverse genetic composition, balanced parental contributions and high levels of recombination all contribute to its value as a genetic and breeding resource. The application of the tobacco MAGIC population for QTL mapping and detecting rare allelic variation was demonstrated using nicotine content as a proof of principle.
