['16227453', 'Type-B Arabidopsis thaliana response regulators (ARRs) are transcription factors  that function in the final step of two-component signaling systems. To  characterize their role in plant growth and development, we isolated T-DNA  insertions within six of the genes (ARR1, ARR2, ARR10, ARR11, ARR12, and ARR18)  from the largest subfamily of type-B ARRs and also constructed various double and  triple combinations of these mutations. Higher order mutants revealed  progressively decreased sensitivity to cytokinin, including effects on root  elongation, lateral root formation, callus induction and greening, and induction  of cytokinin primary response genes. The triple mutant arr1,10,12 showed almost  complete insensitivity to cytokinin under many of the assay conditions used. By  contrast, no significant change in the sensitivity to ethylene was found among  the mutants examined. These results indicate that there is functional overlap  among the type-B ARRs and that they act as positive regulators of cytokinin  signal transduction.', '2005 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.035451', 'Schaller']
