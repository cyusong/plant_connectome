['14871303', 'Small polypeptides can act as important regulatory molecules that coordinate  cellular responses required for differentiation, growth, and development. In a  gain-of-function genetic screen for genes that influence fruit development in  Arabidopsis, we identified a novel gene -DEVIL1 (DVL1) - encoding a small  protein. Overexpression of DVL1 results in pleiotropic phenotypes featured by  shortened stature, rounder rosette leaves, clustered inflorescences, shortened  pedicles, and siliques with pronged tips. cDNA analysis indicates that DVL1 has a  153-nucleotide (nt) open-reading frame (ORF) encoding a 51-amino acid polypeptide  that shares no significant similarity to previously identified proteins. Sequence  alignment shows that DVL1 belongs to a family of related genes that are limited  to angiosperm plants. Ectopic overexpression of each of the five closely related  Arabidopsis DVL genes causes similar phenotypic changes, suggesting overlapping  function in the DVL gene family. Point mutations of conserved amino acids in the  C-terminal region of the DVL1 polypeptide reveal that these conserved residues  are required for DVL1-overexpression phenotypes. Our results show that the DVL  family is a novel class of small polypeptides and the overexpression phenotypes  suggest that these polypeptides may have a role in plant development.', '2004 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313x.2003.01994.x', 'Walker']
