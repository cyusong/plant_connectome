Taken together, our results establish a reciprocal relationship between vine elongation and flowering, and reveal that GA is a positive signal for stem elogation but a negative regulator of flowering in this species. Vines or climbing plants exhibit vigorous vegetative shoot extension. GA have long been recognized as an important signal for seasonal stem elongation and flowering in many woody perennials. However, less is explored as how GA pathway is involved in the regulation of shoot extension in woody vines. Here, we investigated the role of GA and its signaling components in shoot elongation in Jasminum sambac. We found high accumulation of GA<sub>4</sub> in the elongating internode, in contrast to a depletion of GAs in the floral differentiating shoot, which in turn featured a higher zeatin content, and a lower IAA and JA concentrations. This GA accumulation was coincident with the strong expression of JsGA20ox1 and JsGAS1 in the leaves, as well as of the JsGA2ox3 in the internode. Treatment of GA biosynthesis inhibitor reduced elongation while stimulated the terminal flowering. Remarkably, three B-type GA-receptor genes were abundantly expressed in both internodes and leaves of the extending shoots, which could enhance GA responsiveness in heterologous transgenic Arabidopsis. Furthermore, these JsGID1s showed distinct GA-dependent interaction with the JsDELLA in a yeast-two-hybrid assay. Taken together, our results establish a reciprocal relationship between vine elongation and flowering, and reveal that GA is a positive signal for stem elogation but a negative regulator of flowering in this species.
