Endophytism is one of the widely explored phenomena related to orchids and fungi. Endophytic fungi assist plants by supplementing nutrient acquisition, and synthesis of plant growth regulators. <i>Vanda cristata</i> is an epiphytic orchid that has a great diversity of endophytic fungi. Endophytic fungi were isolated from roots, stems, and leaves of <i>V.</i><i>cristata</i> and identified by both morphological and molecular study. Furthermore, the isolated endophytic fungi were subjected to auxin synthesis, phosphate solubilization, ammonia synthesis, and elicitor growth test for understanding their growth-promoting effect in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Altogether, 12 different endophytic fungi were isolated from roots, stems, and leaves of <i>V. cristata</i> of which most species belonged to Ascomycota. Unidentified II fungi were found to be most effective for auxin synthesis and phosphate solubilization while <i>Agaricus bisporous</i> and <i>Mycolepto discus</i> were most effective for ammonia synthesis. We have tested the plant growth-promoting activity of the twelve isolated endophytic fungi on <i>Cymbidium aloifolium</i> protocorms (12 weeks old). All the endophytic fungi showed growth-promoting activity. Plant growth of <i>Cymbidium aloifolium</i> was found higher on the MS medium supplemented with all fungal elicitors. Fungal elicitor CVS4, however, showed the highest plant growth-promoting activity toward <i>C. aloifolium</i>.
