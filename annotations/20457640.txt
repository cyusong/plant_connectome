EFR is a plasma-membrane resident receptor responsible for recognition of microbial elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and thus triggering plant innate immunity to fend off phytopathogens. Functional EFR must be subject to the endoplasmic reticulum quality control (ERQC) machinery for the correct folding and proper assembly in order to reach its final destination. Genetic studies have demonstrated that ERD2b, a counterpart of the yeast or mammalian HDEL receptor ERD2 for retaining proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, is required for EFR function in plants (Li et al., 2009). In this study, we characterized the Arabidopsis glucosidase II beta-subunit via the HDEL motif against the non-redundant protein database. Data mining also revealed that the glucosidase II beta-subunit gene has a highly similar expression pattern to ERD2b and the other known ERQC components involved in EFR biogenesis. Importantly, the T-DNA insertion lines of the glucosidase II beta-subunit gene showed that EFR-controlled responses were substantially reduced or completely blocked in these mutants. The responses include seedling growth inhibition, induction of marker genes, MAP kinase activation, and callose deposition, triggered by peptide elf18, a full mimic of EF-Tu. Taken together, our data indicate a requirement of the glucosidase II beta-subunit for EFR function.
