Many higher plants contain cellular T-DNA (cT-DNA) sequences from <i>Agrobacterium</i> and have been called "natural genetically modified organisms" (nGMOs). Among these natural transformants, the tea plant <i>Camellia sinensis</i> var. <i>sinensis</i> cv. Shuchazao contains a single 5.5 kb T-DNA fragment (CaTA) with three inactive T-DNA genes, with a 1 kb inverted repeat at the ends. <i>Camellia</i> plants are allogamous, so that each individual may contain two different CaTA alleles. 142 <i>Camellia</i> accessions, belonging to 10 of 11 species of the section <i>Thea</i>, were investigated for the presence of CaTA alleles. All accessions were found to contain the CaTA insert, showing that section <i>Thea</i> derives from a single transformed ancestor. Allele phasing showed that 82 accessions each contained two different CaTA alleles, 60 others had a unique allele. A phylogenetic tree of these 225 alleles showed two separate groups, A and B, further divided into subgroups. Indel distribution corresponded in most cases with these groups. The alleles of the different <i>Camellia</i> species were distributed over groups A and B, and different species showed very similar CaTA alleles. This indicates that the species boundaries for section <i>Thea</i> may not be precise and require revision. The nucleotide divergence of the indirect CaTA repeats indicates that the cT-DNA insertion took place about 15 Mio years ago, before the emergence of section <i>Thea</i>. The CaTA structure of a <i>C. fangchengensis</i> accession has an exceptional structure. We present a working model for the origin and evolution of nGMO plants derived from allogamous transformants.
