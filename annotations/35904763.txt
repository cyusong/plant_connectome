Leaf morphology is one of the most important features of the ideal plant architecture. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling this feature in crops remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) wide leaf 1 (wl1) mutant, which has wider leaves than the wild-type due to more vascular bundles and greater distance between small vascular bundles. WL1 encodes a Cys-2/His-2-type zinc finger protein that interacts with Tillering and Dwarf 1 (TAD1), a co-activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (a multi-subunit E3 ligase). The APC/CTAD1 complex degrades WL1 via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome degradation pathway. Loss-of-function of TAD1 resulted in plants with narrow leaves due to reduced vascular bundle numbers and distance between the small vascular bundles. Interestingly, we found that WL1 negatively regulated the expression of a narrow leaf gene, NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1), by recruiting the co-repressor TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEIN and directly binding to the NAL1 regulatory region to inhibit its expression by reducing the chromatin histone acetylation. Furthermore, biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that TAD1, WL1, and NAL1 operated in a common pathway to control the leaf width. Our study establishes an important framework for understanding the APC/CTAD1-WL1-NAL1 pathway-mediated control of leaf width in rice, and provides insights for improving crop plant architecture.
