The research data life cycle from project planning to data publishing is an integral part of current research. Until the last decade, researchers were responsible for all associated phases in addition to the actual research and were assisted only at certain points by IT or bioinformaticians. Starting with advances in sequencing, the automation of analytical methods in all life science fields, including in plant phenotyping, has led to ever-increasing amounts of ever more complex data. The tasks associated with these challenges now often exceed the expertise of and infrastructure available to scientists, leading to an increased risk of data loss over time. The IPK Gatersleben has one of the world's largest germplasm collections and two decades of experience in crop plant research data management. In this article we show how challenges in modern, data-driven research can be addressed by data stewards. Based on concrete use cases, data management processes and best practices from plant phenotyping, we describe which expertise and skills are required and how data stewards as an integral actor can enhance the quality of a necessary digital transformation in progressive research.
