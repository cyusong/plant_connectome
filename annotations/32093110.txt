Epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling are crucial regulators of chromatin architecture and gene expression in plants. Their dynamics are significantly influenced by oxidants, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), and antioxidants, like pyridine nucleotides and glutathione in plants. These redox intermediates regulate the activities and expression of many enzymes involved in DNA methylation, histone methylation and acetylation, and chromatin remodeling, consequently controlling plant growth and development, and responses to diverse environmental stresses. In recent years, much progress has been made in understanding the functional mechanisms of epigenetic modifications and the roles of redox mediators in controlling gene expression in plants. However, the integrated view of the mechanisms for redox regulation of the epigenetic marks is limited. In this review, we summarize recent advances on the roles and mechanisms of redox components in regulating multiple epigenetic modifications, with a focus of the functions of ROS, NO, and multiple antioxidants in plants.
