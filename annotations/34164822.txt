Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in response to biotic and abiotic stress through acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to decoy mature miRNAs. However, whether this mechanism is involved in cotton salt stress response remains unknown. We report the characterization of an endogenous lncRNA, lncRNA354, whose expression was reduced in salt-treated cotton and was localized at the nucleus and cytoplasm. Using endogenous target mimic (eTM) analysis, we predicted that lncRNA354 had a potential binding site for miR160b. Transient expression in tobacco demonstrated that lncRNA354 was a miR160b eTM and attenuated miR160b suppression of its target genes, including auxin response factors (ARFs). Silencing or overexpressing lncRNA354 affected the expression of miR160b and target ARFs. Silencing lncRNA354 and targets GhARF17/18 resulted in taller cotton plants and enhanced the resistant to salt stress. Overexpression of lncRNA354 and targets GhARF17/18 in Arabidopsis led to dwarf plants, decreased root dry weight and reduced salt tolerance. Our results show that the lncRNA354-miR160b effect on GhARF17/18 expression may modulate auxin signalling and thus affect growth. These results also shed new light on a mechanism of lncRNA-associated responses to salt stress.
