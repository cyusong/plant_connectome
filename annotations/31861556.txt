Post-translational modification of cellular proteins by sumoylation plays a vital role in stress responses of plants. However, the mechanisms underlying the sumoylation's involvement in stress responses in crop species remain largely unknown. Herein, a maize class-I SUMO conjugating enzyme gene (<i>ZmSCE1d</i>) was identified, whose expression was upregulated upon drought stress. Over-expression of <i>ZmSCE1d</i> in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants increased SUMO conjugates and improved drought tolerance. The <i>ZmSCE1d</i>-transgenic plants showed higher antioxidant enzyme activities, but lower reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation upon drought stress. Furthermore, transcripts of several drought-responsive genes were significantly elevated, as revealed by qPCR in the transgenic lines. Taken together, these data have demonstrated that <i>ZmSCE1d</i> overexpression improved drought tolerance likely by regulating sumoylation levels, antioxidant capability, and drought-responsive gene expression in transgenic plants. This study may facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms underlying SCE-mediated sumoylation under drought stress and accelerate genetic improvement of crop plants tolerant to drought stress by manipulating the SUMO system.
