Organ primordia develop from founder cells into organs due to coordinated patterns of cell division. How patterned cell division is regulated during organ formation, however, is not well understood. Here, we show that the PUCHI gene, which encodes a putative APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding protein transcription factor, is required for the coordinated pattern of cell divisions during lateral root formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Recessive mutations in PUCHI disturbed cell division patterns in the lateral root primordium, resulting in swelling of the proximal region of lateral roots. PUCHI expression was initially detected in all of the cells in early lateral root primordia, and later it was restricted to the proximal region of the primordia. Stable expression of PUCHI required auxin-responsive elements in its promoter region, and exogenous auxin increased the level of PUCHI mRNA accumulation. These results suggest that PUCHI acts downstream of auxin signaling and that this gene contributes to lateral root morphogenesis through affecting the pattern of cell divisions during the early stages of primordium development.
