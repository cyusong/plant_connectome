Lately we have published on the characterization of the upstream of SamDC gene from rice and investigated the involvement of various cis-elements present in the promoter region in its transcriptional regulation. Analysis of SamDC expression showed that it was inducible by abiotic stresses like salinity, drought, and cold as well as by light and ABA treatment. Furthermore, DNA protein interaction studies have identified transacting actors responsible for its expression after abiotic stresses or light inducibility. Here we have further discussed on the possible role of these cis-elements in modulating the transcriptional network and comment on their function in relation to polyamine biosynthesis during periods of abiotic stress in rice.
