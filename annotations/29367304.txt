The cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1 is essential for mitosis in fungi and animals. Plant genomes contain the CDK1 ortholog CDKA and a plant kingdom-specific relative, CDKB. The green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> has a long G1 growth period followed by rapid cycles of DNA replication and cell division. We show that null alleles of CDKA extend the growth period prior to the first division cycle and modestly extend the subsequent division cycles, but do not prevent cell division, indicating at most a minor role for the CDK1 ortholog in mitosis in Chlamydomonas. A null allele of cyclin A has a similar though less extreme phenotype. In contrast, both CDKB and cyclin B are essential for mitosis. CDK kinase activity measurements imply that the predominant in vivo complexes are probably cyclin A-CDKA and cyclin B-CDKB. We propose a negative feedback loop: CDKA activates cyclin B-CDKB. Cyclin B-CDKB in turn promotes mitotic entry and inactivates cyclin A-CDKA. Cyclin A-CDKA and cyclin B-CDKB may redundantly promote DNA replication. We show that the anaphase-promoting complex is required for inactivation of both CDKA and CDKB and is essential for anaphase. These results are consistent with findings in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and may delineate the core of plant kingdom cell cycle control that, compared with the well-studied yeast and animal systems, exhibits deep conservation in some respects and striking divergence in others.
