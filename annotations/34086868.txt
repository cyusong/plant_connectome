Plant genomes lack genes encoding intermediate filament proteins, including lamins; however, functional lamin analogues are presumed to exist in plants. Plant-specific coiled-coil proteins, that is, nuclear matrix constituent proteins (NMCPs), are the most likely candidates as the structural elements of the nuclear lamina because they exhibit a lamin-like domain arrangement. They are exclusively localized at the nuclear periphery and have functions that are analogous to those of lamins. However, their assembly into filamentous polymers has not yet been confirmed. In this study, we examined the higher-order structure of NMCP1 and NMCP2 in Apium graveolens cells by using stimulated emission depletion microscopy combined with immunofluorescence cell labelling. Our analyses revealed that NMCP1 and NMCP2 form intricate filamentous networks, which include thick segments consisting of filament bundles, forming a dense filamentous layer extending across the nuclear periphery. Furthermore, the outermost chromatin distribution was found to be in the nucleoplasm-facing region of the nuclear lamina. Recombinant Daucus carota NMCP1 with a His-tag produced in Escherichia coli refolded into dimers and self-assembled into filaments and filament bundles. These results suggest that NMCP1 and NMCP2 organize into the nuclear lamina by forming a filamentous network with filament bundles that localize at the nuclear periphery.
