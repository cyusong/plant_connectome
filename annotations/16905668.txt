An Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) multigene family (predicted to be more than 20 members) encodes plant C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatases that dephosphorylate Ser residues in tandem heptad repeat sequences of the RNA polymerase II C terminus. CTD phosphatase-like (CPL) isoforms 1 and 3 are regulators of osmotic stress and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Evidence presented herein indicates that CPL3 and CPL4 are homologs of a prototype CTD phosphatase, FCP1 (TFIIF-interacting CTD-phosphatase). CPL3 and CPL4 contain catalytic FCP1 homology and breast cancer 1 C terminus (BRCT) domains. Recombinant CPL3 and CPL4 interact with AtRAP74, an Arabidopsis ortholog of a FCP1-interacting TFIIF subunit. A CPL3 or CPL4 C-terminal fragment that contains the BRCT domain mediates molecular interaction with AtRAP74. Consistent with their predicted roles in transcriptional regulation, green fluorescent protein fusion proteins of CPL3, CPL4, and RAP74 all localize to the nucleus. cpl3 mutations that eliminate the BRCT or FCP1 homology domain cause ABA hyperactivation of the stress-inducible RD29a promoter, whereas RNAi suppression of CPL4 results in dwarfism and reduced seedling growth. These results indicate CPL3 and CPL4 are a paralogous pair of general transcription regulators with similar biochemical properties, but are required for the distinct developmental and environmental responses. CPL4 is necessary for normal plant growth and thus most orthologous to fungal and metazoan FCP1, whereas CPL3 is an isoform that specifically facilitates ABA signaling.
