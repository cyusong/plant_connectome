Seed storage proteins (SSPs) provide free amino acids and energy for the process of seed germination. Although degradation of SSPs by the aspartic proteases isolated from seeds has been documented in vitro, there is still no genetic evidence for involvement of aspartic proteases in seed germination. Here we report that the aspartic protease ASPG1 (ASPARTIC PROTEASE IN GUARD CELL 1) plays an important role in the process of dormancy, viability and germination of Arabidopsis seeds. We show that aspg1-1 mutants have enhanced seed dormancy and reduced seed viability. A significant increase in expression of DELLA genes which act as repressors in the gibberellic acid signal transduction pathway were detected in aspg1-1 during seed germination. Seed germination of aspg1-1 mutants was more sensitive to treatment with paclobutrazol (PAC; a gibberellic acid biosynthesis inhibitor). In contrast, seed germination of ASPG1 overexpression (OE) transgenic lines showed resistant to PAC. The degradation of SSPs in germinating seeds was severely impaired in aspg1-1 mutants. Moreover, the development of aspg1-1 young seedlings was arrested when grown on the nutrient-free medium. Thus ASPG1 is important for seed dormancy, seed longevity and seed germination, and its function is associated with degradation of SSPs and regulation of gibberellic acid signaling in Arabidopsis.
