Plant growth and productivity are greatly impacted by environmental stresses. Therefore, plants have evolved various sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation to nonoptimal environments. Recent studies using RNA metabolism-related mutants have revealed that RNA processing, RNA decay and RNA stability play an important role in regulating gene expression at a post-transcriptional level in response to abiotic stresses. Studies indicate that RNA metabolism is a unified network, and modification of stress adaptation-related transcripts at multiple steps of RNA metabolism is necessary to control abiotic stress-related gene expression. Recent studies have also demonstrated the important role of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in regulating abiotic stress-related gene expression and revealed their involvement in various biological functions through their regulation of DNA methylation, DNA structural modifications, histone modifications and RNA-RNA interactions. ncRNAs regulate mRNA transcription and their synthesis is affected by mRNA processing and degradation. In the present review, recent findings pertaining to the role of the metabolic regulation of mRNAs and ncRNAs in abiotic stress adaptation are summarized and discussed.
