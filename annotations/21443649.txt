The enlargement of receptacle cells during strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) fruit development is a critical factor determining fruit size, with the increase in cell expansion being one of the most important physiological processes regulated by the phytohormone gibberellin (GA). Here, we studied the role of GA during strawberry fruit development by analyzing the endogenous content of bioactive GAs and the expression of key components of GA signalling and metabolism. Bioactive GA(1) , GA(3) and GA(4) were monitored during fruit development, with the content of GA(4) being extremely high in the receptacle, peaking at the white stage of development. •Genes with high homology to genes encoding GA pathway components, including receptors (FaGID1(GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF1)b and FaGID1c), DELLA (FaRGA(REPRESSOR OF GA) and FaGAI(GA-INSENSITIVE)), and enzymes involved in GA biosynthesis (FaGA3ox) and catabolism (FaGA2ox), were identified, and their expression in different tissues and developmental stages of strawberry fruit was studied in detail. The expression of all of these genes showed a stage-specific pattern during fruit development and was highest in the receptacle. FaGID1c bound GA in vitro, interacted with FaRGA in vitro and in vivo, and increased GA responses when ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis. This study thus reveals key elements of GA responses in strawberry and points to a critical role for GA in the development of the receptacle.
