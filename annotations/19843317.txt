['19843317', 'In Arabidopsis, CORYNE (CRN), a new member of the receptor kinase family, was  recently isolated as a key player involved in the CLAVATA3 (CLV3) signaling  pathway, thereby playing an important role in regulating the development of shoot  and root apical meristems. However, the precise relationships among CLAVATA1  (CLV1), CLAVATA2 (CLV2), and CRN receptors remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate  the subcellular localization of CRN and analyze the interactions among CLV1,  CLV2, and CRN using firefly luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) assays in  both Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts and Nicotiana benthamiana leaves.  Fluorescence targeting showed that CRN was localized to the plasma membrane. The  LCI assays coupled with co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that CLV2 can  directly interact with CRN in the absence of CLV3. Additional LCI assays showed  that CLV1 did not interact with CLV2, but can interact weakly with CRN. We also  found that CLV1 can interact with CLV2-CRN heterodimers, implying that these  three proteins may form a complex. Moreover, CRN, rather than CLV1 and CLV2, was  able to form homodimers without CLV3 stimulation. Taken together, our results add  direct evidence to the newly proposed two-parallel receptor pathways model and  therefore provide new insights into the CLV3 signaling pathway.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04049.x', 'Lin']
