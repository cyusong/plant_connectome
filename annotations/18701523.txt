['18701523', 'Sucrose synthase (SUS) is a key enzyme in sucrose metabolism. This enzyme  catalyzes the reversible conversion of sucrose and UDP to UDP-glucose and  fructose. In the Arabidopsis SUS gene family (six members), SUS2 is strongly and  specifically expressed in Arabidopsis seeds during the maturation phase. Using  specific antibodies, we have shown that SUS2 is localized in the embryo,  endosperm and seed coat with differential patterns. During the maturation phase,  the SUS2 protein seems to be mainly co-localized with plastids in the embryo.  This novel finding is discussed in relation to the role of this enzyme in storage  organs.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcn117', 'Rochat']
