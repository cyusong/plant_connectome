Bacterial flagella are perceived by the innate immune systems of plants<sup>1</sup> and animals<sup>2</sup> alike, triggering resistance. Common to higher plants is the immunoreceptor FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2)<sup>3</sup>, which detects flagellin via its most conserved epitope, flg22. Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which causes crown gall disease in many crop plants, has a highly diverged flg22 epitope and evades immunodetection by plants so far studied. We asked whether, as a next step in this game of 'hide and seek', there are plant species that have evolved immunoreceptors with specificity for the camouflaged flg22<sup>Atum</sup> of A. tumefaciens. In the wild grape species Vitis riparia, we discovered FLS2<sup>XL</sup>, a previously unknown form of FLS2, that provides exquisite sensitivity to typical flg22 and to flg22<sup>Atum</sup>. As exemplified by ectopic expression in tobacco, FLS2<sup>XL</sup> can limit crown gall disease caused by A. tumefaciens.
