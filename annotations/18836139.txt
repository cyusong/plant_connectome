['18836139', 'Six genes encode proteins with acyl-CoA-binding domains in Arabidopsis thaliana.  They are the small 10-kDa cytosolic acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP),  membrane-associated ACBP1 and ACBP2, extracellularly-targeted ACBP3, and  kelch-motif containing ACBP4 and ACBP5. Here, the interaction of ACBP4 with an A.  thaliana ethylene-responsive element binding protein (AtEBP), identified in a  yeast two-hybrid screen, was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. The subcellular  localization of ACBP4 and AtEBP, was addressed using an ACBP4:DsRed red  fluorescent protein fusion and a green fluorescent protein (GFP):AtEBP fusion.  Transient expression of these autofluoresence-tagged proteins in agroinfiltrated  tobacco leaves, followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, indicated their  co-localization predominantly at the cytosol which was confirmed by FRET  analysis. Immuno-electron microscopy on Arabidopsis sections not only localized  ACBP4 to the cytosol but also to the periphery of the nucleus upon closer  examination, perhaps as a result of its interaction with AtEBP. Furthermore, the  expression of ACBP4 and AtEBP in Northern blot analyses was induced by the  ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, methyl jasmonate  treatments, and Botrytis cinerea infection, suggesting that the interaction of  ACBP4 and AtEBP may be related to AtEBP-mediated defence possibly via ethylene  and/or jasmonate signalling.', '2008', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ern241', 'Chye']
