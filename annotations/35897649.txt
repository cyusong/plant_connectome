<i>Beet curly top virus</i> (BCTV) significantly reduces sugar beet yield in semi-arid production areas. Genetic resistance to BCTV is limited; therefore, identification of additional resistance-associated factors is highly desired. Using 16S rRNA sequencing and BCTV resistant (R) genotypes (KDH13, KDH4-9) along with a susceptible (S) genotype (KDH19-17), we investigated leaf bacteriome changes during BCTV post inoculation (pi). At day 6 (~6-week-old plants), <i>Cyanobacteria</i> were predominant (~90%); whereas, at week 4 (~10-week-old plants) <i>Firmicutes</i> (11-66%), <i>Bacteroidetes</i> (17-26%), and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> (12-29%) were predominant phyla and genotype dependent. Both <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i>, increased post infection only in the R lines. The bacterial genera <i>Brevibacillus</i> increased at 6 dpi, and <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> at 4 wkpi in the R lines. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) identified potential biomarkers in the R vs. S lines. Functional profiling revealed bacterial enrichment associated with the TCA cycle, polyisoprenoid, and L-methionine biosynthesis pathways only in KDH4-9 at 6 dpi. At 4 wkpi, bacteria associated with tryptophan and palmitate biosynthesis in the R lines, and uridine monophosphate, phosphatidyl glycerol, and phospholipid biosynthesis in the S line, were enriched. Future characterization of bacterial genera with antiviral properties will help establish their use as biocontrol agents/biomarkers against BCTV.
