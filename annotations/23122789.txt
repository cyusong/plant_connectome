Rosa meillandina plants were used to study the effects of water deficit on photosynthesis and chlororespiration. Plants showed high tolerance to heat and high illumination in controlled conditions that ensured that there was no water deficit. However, when heat and high illumination were accompanied by low watering photosynthetic linear electron transport was down regulated, as indicated by the reduced photochemistry efficiency of PS II, which was associated with an increase in the non-photochemical quenching of fluorescence. In addition to the effects on the photosynthetic activity, changes were also observed in the plastidial NDH complex, PTOX and PGR5. In plants exposed to heat and high illumination without water deficit, the activities and amounts of the chlororespiration enzymes, NDH complex and PTOX, remained similar to the control and only increased in response to drought, high light and heat stress, applied together. In contrast, both the PS I activity and the amount of PGR5 polypeptide were higher in plants exposed to heat and high illumination without water deficit than in those with water deficit. The results indicated that in the conditions studied, the contribution of chlororespiration to regulating photosynthetic electron flow is not relevant when there is no water deficit, and another pathway, such as cyclic electron flow involving PGR5 polypeptide, may be more important. However, when PS II activity is inhibited by drought, chlororespiration, together with other routes of electron input to the electron transfer chain, is probably essential.

PS II: !down regulates! photochemistry efficiency
NDH complex: !increases! in response to drought, high light and heat stress
PS I: !higher! in plants exposed to heat and high illumination without water deficit
PGR5 polypeptide: !contributes to! cyclic electron flow
