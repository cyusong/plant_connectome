Controlled spatiotemporal cell division and expansion are responsible for floral bilateral symmetry. Genetic studies have pointed to class II TCP genes as major regulators of cell division and floral patterning in model core eudicots. Here we study their evolution in perianth-bearing Piperales and their expression in Aristolochia, a rare occurrence of bilateral perianth outside eudicots and monocots. The evolution of class II TCP genes reveals single-copy CYCLOIDEA-like genes and three paralogs of CINCINNATA (CIN) in early diverging angiosperms. All class II TCP genes have independently duplicated in Aristolochia subgenus Siphisia. Also CIN2 genes duplicated before the diversification of Saruma and Asarum. Sequence analysis shows that CIN1 and CIN3 share motifs with Cyclin proteins and CIN2 genes have lost the miRNA319a binding site. Expression analyses of all paralogs of class II TCP genes in Aristolochia fimbriata point to a role of CYC and CIN genes in maintaining differential perianth expansion during mid- and late flower developmental stages by promoting cell division in the distal and ventral portion of the limb. It is likely that class II TCP genes also contribute to cell division in the leaf, the gynoecium and the ovules in A. fimbriata.
