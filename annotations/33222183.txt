Meiotic chromosome pairing between homoeologous chromosomes was reported in many nascent allopolyploids. Homoeologous pairing is gradually eliminated and replaced by exclusive homologous pairing in well-established allopolyploids, an evolutionary process referred to as the diploidization of allopolyploids. A fundamental question of the diploidization of allopolyploids is whether and to what extent the DNA sequence variation among homoeologous chromosomes contribute to the establishment of exclusive homologous chromosome pairing. We developed aneuploid tetraploid maize lines that contain three copies of chromosome 10 derived from inbred lines B73 and H99. We were able to identify the parental origin of each copy of chromosome 10 in the materials using oligonucleotide-based haplotype-specific chromosome painting. We demonstrate that the two identical copies of chromosome 10 from H99 pair preferentially over chromosome 10 from B73 in different stages of prophase I and metaphase I during meiosis. Thus, homologous chromosome pairing is favored to partners with the most similar DNA sequences and can be discriminated based on cryptic sequence variation. We propose that innate preference of homologous chromosome pairing exists in nascent allopolyploids and serves as the first layer that would eventually block all homoeologous chromosome pairing in allopolyploids.

Meiotic chromosome pairing: !favors! Homologous chromosomes 
DNA sequence variation: !discriminates! Homoeologous chromosomes 
Innate preference: !blocks! Homoeologous chromosome pairing
