Nitrogen (N) application is one of the most effective methods to alleviate salt-induced damage on plants. Forage bermudagrass has higher utilization potential on saline soil, but whether its N requirement changed under high salt stress has not been studied. Through examining plant growth-related traits, salt-stress-responsive physiological traits, photosynthesis, N metabolism, and forage quality supplied with different N concentrations under high salt stress (200 mM NaCl), we noticed that the optimum N requirement of forage bermudagrass reduced. When supplied with 10 mM N under higher salt stress, plants had a similar biomass, turf color, and chlorophyll content with plants supplied with 15 mM N, accompanied by a lower firing rate and Na<sup>+</sup> content of leaves. The N content, crude protein, crude fat content, the expression of <i>AMTs</i> (ammonium transporters), <i>NR</i> (nitrate reductase), <i>GS</i> (glutamine synthetase), and <i>GOGAT</i> (glutamate synthetase), the chlorophyll fluorescence curve, and parameters of leaves (e.g., PI<sub>ABS</sub>; PI<sub>CS</sub>; ABS/RC; TRo/RC; ETo/RC) all peaked under 10 mM N under high salt stress instead of 15 mM N. Through exploring the proper N application under higher salt stress and its alleviation mechanisms, our results indicated that moderate reduction in N application under high salt level had a maximum promotion effect on the salt tolerance of forage bermudagrass without growth or forage quality inhibition. These response mechanisms obtained can provide a useful reference for N application in moderation rather than in excess on forage bermudagrass, especially in higher salinity areas.
