Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in world agriculture and for general vegetation control in a wide range of situations. Global and often intensive glyphosate selection of very large weedy plant populations has resulted in widespread glyphosate resistance evolution in populations of many weed species. Here, working with a glyphosate-resistant (GR) <i>Echinochloa colona</i> population that evolved in a Western Australia agricultural field, we identified an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (<i>EcABCC8</i>) that is consistently up-regulated in GR plants. When expressed in transgenic rice, this <i>EcABCC8</i> transporter endowed glyphosate resistance. Equally, rice, maize, and soybean overexpressing the <i>EcABCC8</i> ortholog genes were made resistant to glyphosate. Conversely, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the <i>EcABCC8</i> ortholog gene <i>OsABCC8</i> increased rice susceptibility to glyphosate. Subcellular localization analysis and quantification of glyphosate cellular levels in treated <i>ABCC8</i> transgenic rice plants and isolated leaf protoplasts as well as structural modeling support that EcABCC8 is likely a plasma membrane-localized transporter extruding cytoplasmic glyphosate to the apoplast, lowering the cellular glyphosate level. This is a report of a membrane transporter effluxing glyphosate in a GR plant species, and its function is likely conserved in crop plant species.
