Prosthetic lipoyl groups are essential for the metabolic activity of several multienzyme complexes in most organisms. In plants, octanoyltransferase (LIP2) and lipoyl synthase (LIP1) enzymes in the mitochondria and plastids participate in the de novo synthesis of lipoic acid, and in the attachment of the lipoyl cofactors to their specific targets. In plastids, the lipoylated pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the synthesis of the acetyl-CoA that is required for de novo fatty acid synthesis. Since lipoic acid transport across plastid membranes has not been demonstrated, these organelles require specific plastidial LIP1 and LIP2 activities for the in situ synthesis of this cofactor. Previously, one essential LIP1 enzyme and two redundant LIP2 enzymes have been identified within Arabidopsis chloroplasts. In this study, two plastidial sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) LIP2 genes (HaLIP2p1 and HaLIP2p2) were identified, cloned and characterized. The expression of these genes in different tissues was studied and the tertiary structure of the peptides they encode was modeled by protein docking. These genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and their impact on bacterial fatty acid synthesis was studied. Finally, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing HaLIP2p1 were generated and their seed lipid profiles analyzed. The lipid composition of the transgenic seeds, particularly their TAG species, differed from that of wild-type plants, revealing a relationship between lipoic acid synthesis and the accumulation of storage lipids in Arabidopsis seeds.
