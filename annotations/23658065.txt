['23658065', 'In plants, the cytokinin metabolic processes, including cytokinin biosynthesis,  interconversion, inactivation, and degradation, play critical roles in the  regulation of cytokinin homeostasis and plant development. Purine metabolic  enzymes have been implied to catalyze the cytokinin interconversion in previous  works. In this study, we report that Adenine Phosphoribosyl Transferase 1 (APT1)  is the causal gene of the high-dose cytokinin-resistant mutants. APT1 catalyzes  the cytokinin conversion from free bases to nucleotides, and is functionally  predominant among the five members of the Arabidopsis Adenine Phosphoribosyl  Transferase family. Loss of APT1 activity in plants leads to excess accumulation  of cytokinin bases, thus evoking myriad cytokinin-regulated responses, such as  delayed leaf senescence, anthocyanin accumulation, and downstream gene  expression. Thus, our study defines APT1 as a key metabolic enzyme participating  in the cytokinin inactivation by phosphoribosylation.', '2013 Sep', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/sst071', 'Guo']
