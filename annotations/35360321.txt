Nitrogen (N) is an important element for most terrestrial ecosystems; its variation among different plant organs, and allocation mechanisms are the basis for the structural stability and functional optimization of natural plant communities. The nature of spatial variations of N and its allocation mechanisms in plants in the Tibetan Plateau-known as the world's third pole-have not been reported on a large scale. In this study, we consistently investigated the N content in different organs of plants in 1564 natural community plots in Tibet Plateau, using a standard spatial-grid sampling setup. On average, the N content was estimated to be 19.21, 4.12, 1.14, and 10.86 mg g<sup>-1</sup> in the leaf, branch, trunk, and root, respectively, with small spatial variations. Among organs in communities, leaves were the most active, and had the highest N content, independent of the spatial location; as for vegetation type, communities dominated by herbaceous plants had higher N content than those dominated by woody plants. Furthermore, the allocation of N among different plant organs was allometric, and not significantly influenced by vegetation types and environmental factors; the homeostasis of N was also not affected much by the environment, and varied among the plant organs. In addition, the N allocation strategy within Tibet Plateau for different plant organs was observed to be consistent with that in China. Our findings systematically explore for the first time, the spatial variations in N and allometric mechanisms in natural plant communities in Tibet Plateau and establish a spatial-parameters database to optimize N cycle models.
