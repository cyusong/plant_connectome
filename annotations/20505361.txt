All photosynthetic organisms face the difficulty of maintaining cellular metabolism in the absence of photosynthetic active radiation during the night. Although many consuming metabolic pathways (e.g., fatty acid synthesis) are only active in the light, plant cells still require basic levels of metabolic energy and reductive power during the night for sustained growth and development.
