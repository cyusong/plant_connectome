Expression profiling of two paralogous arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)-specific blue copper-binding gene (MtBcp1a and MtBcp1b) isoforms was performed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in wild-type Medicago truncatula Jemalong 5 (J5) during the mycorrhizal development with Glomus intraradices for up to 7 weeks. Time-course analysis in J5 showed that expression of both MtBcp1 genes increased continuously and correlated strongly with the colonization intensity and arbuscule content. MtPT4, selected as a reference gene of the functional plant-fungus association, showed a weaker correlation to mycorrhizal development. In a second experiment, a range of mycorrhizal mutants of the wild-type J5 was assessed. Strictly AM-penetration-defective TRV25-C and TRV25-D (dmi3, Mtsym13), hypomycorrhizal TR25 and TR89 (dmi2, Mtsym2) mutants, and a hypermycorrhizal mutant TRV17 (sunn, Mtsym12) were compared with J5 3 and 7 weeks after inoculation. No MtBcp1 transcripts were detected in the mutants blocked at the appressoria stage. Conversely, TR25, TR89, and J5 showed a gradual increase of the expression of both MtBcp1 genes in 3- and 7-week-old plants, similar to the increase in colonization intensity and arbuscule abundance. The strong correlation between the expression level of AM-specific blue copper-binding protein-encoding genes and AM colonization may imply a basic role in symbiotic functioning for these genes, which may serve as new molecular markers of arbuscule development in M. truncatula.
