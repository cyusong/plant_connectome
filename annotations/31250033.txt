['31250033', 'Oxidative stress can lead to plant growth retardation, yield loss, and death. The  atr7 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits pronounced tolerance to oxidative  stress. Using positional cloning, confirmed by knockout and RNA interference  (RNAi) lines, we identified the atr7 mutation and revealed that ATR7 is a  previously uncharacterized gene with orthologs in other seed plants but with no  homology to genes in lower plants, fungi or animals. Expression of ATR7-GFP  fusion shows that ATR7 is a nuclear-localized protein. RNA-seq analysis reveals  that transcript levels of genes encoding abiotic- and oxidative stress-related  transcription factors (DREB19, HSFA2, ZAT10), chromatin remodelers (CHR34), and  unknown or uncharacterized proteins (AT5G59390, AT1G30170, AT1G21520) are  elevated in atr7. This indicates that atr7 is primed for an upcoming oxidative  stress via pathways involving genes of unknown functions. Collectively, the data  reveal ATR7 as a novel seed plants-specific nuclear regulator of oxidative stress  response.', '2020 Feb', 'Cell Mol Life Sci', '10.1007/s00018-019-03202-5', 'ORCID:']
