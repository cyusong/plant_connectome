The cryptochrome - photolyase family (CPF) consists of homologous flavoproteins having completely different functions involving DNA repair, circadian rhythm and/or photoreception. From the original photolyases, working either as (6-4) or cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyases, the animal- and plant-type cryptochromes, respectively, evolved and also the more intermediate DASH cryptochromes. Whereas animal cryptochromes work mostly in clock-related functions, plant cryptochromes are also directly involved in developmental processes such as hypocotyl elongation or flower induction. In diatoms, all types of cryptochromes and photolyases were predicted from genome sequences. However, up to now only two proteins have been characterised in more detail, CPF1 and CryP. CPF1 is related to animal-type cryptochromes, but works as a (6-4) photolyase in addition to having photoreceptor functions. It was shown to interact with the CLOCK:Bmal1 heterodimer in a heterologous system, and thus is probably involved in clock-related processes. Moreover, CPF1 directly influences transcription. The latter was also true for CryP, which is a cryptochrome distantly related to plant-type cryptochromes. In addition, CryP influences light-harvesting protein accumulation. For all diatom cryptochromes, down-stream signalling has to proceed via interaction partners different from the classical proteins involved in cryptochrome signalling in higher plants, because these candidates are missing in diatoms.
