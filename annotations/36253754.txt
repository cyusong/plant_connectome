Evaluation of native soil microbes is a realistic way to develop bio-agents for ecological restoration. Soil alkalinity, which has a high pH, is one of the most common concerns in dry and semi-arid climates. Alkaline soils face problems due to poor physical properties, which affect plant growth and crop production. A pot experiment was carried out to investigate the impact of native mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on the wheat plant (Triticum aestivum L.) under two levels of alkalinity stress -T1 (37 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>), T2 (74 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) - at two developmental stages (the vegetative and productive stages). Alkalinity stress significantly inhibited the germination percentage, plant biomass, photosynthetic pigments, and some nutrients (K, N, and P). Mycorrhizal inoculation improved growth parameters and productivity of wheat-stressed plants. However, lipid peroxidation was significantly lowered in mycorrhizal-inoculated plants compared to non-inoculated plants. Catalase and peroxidase were inhibited in wheat leaves and roots by alkalinity, while mycorrhiza promoted the activity of these enzymes. The results of this study demonstrated that alkalinity stress had highly negative effects on some growth parameters of the wheat plant, while AMF inoculation attenuated these detrimental effects of alkalinity stress at two stages by reducing the pH and Na concentration and increasing the availability of P and the productivity of wheat in particular crop yield parameters.
