A protein complex consisting of a MYB, basic Helix-Loop-Helix, and a WDR protein, the MBW complex, regulates five traits, namely the production of anthocyanidin, proanthocyanidin, and seed-coat mucilage, and the development of trichomes and root hairs. For complexes involved in trichome and root hair development it has been shown that the interaction of two MBW proteins can be counteracted by the respective third protein (called competitive complex formation). We examined competitive complex formation for selected MBW proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, Arabis alpina, Gossypium hirsutum, Petunia hybrida, and Zea mays. Quantitative analyses of the competitive binding of MYBs and WDRs to bHLHs were done by pull-down assays using ProtA- and luciferase-tagged proteins expressed in human HEC cells. We found that some bHLHs show competitive complex formation whilst others do not. Competitive complex formation strongly correlated with a phylogenetic tree constructed with the bHLH proteins under investigation, suggesting a functional relevance. We demonstrate that this different behavior can be explained by changes in one amino acid and that this position is functionally relevant in trichome development but not in anthocyanidin regulation.
