SignificancePlants evolved in an environment colonized by a vast number of microbes, which collectively constitute the plant microbiota. The majority of microbiota taxa are nonpathogenic and may be beneficial to plants under certain ecological or environmental conditions. We conducted experiments to understand the features of long-term interactions of nonpathogenic microbiota members with plants. We found that a multiplication-death equilibrium explained the shared long-term static populations of nonpathogenic bacteria and that in planta bacterial transcriptomic signatures were characteristic of the stationary phase, a physiological state in which stress protection responses are induced. These results may have significant implications in understanding the bulk of "nonpathogenic" plant-microbiota interactions that occur in agricultural and natural ecosystems.
