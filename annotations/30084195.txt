Multiple mechanisms for the regulation of electron transport have been identified and are unevenly distributed among photosynthetic organisms. Flavodiiron proteins (FLVs) influence photosynthetic electron transport by accepting electrons downstream of photosystem I to reduce oxygen to water. FLV activity has been demonstrated in cyanobacteria, green algae and mosses to be important in avoiding photosystem I overreduction upon changes in light intensity. FLV-encoding sequences were nevertheless lost during evolution by angiosperms, suggesting that these plants increased the efficiency of other mechanisms capable of accepting electrons from photosystem I, making the FLV activity for protection from overreduction superfluous or even detrimental for photosynthetic efficiency.

Photosystem I: !accepts electrons from! FLVs 
FLVs: !reduce oxygen to! water 
Cyanobacteria, green algae, mosses: !possess! FLV-encoding sequences 
Angiosperms: !lost! FLV-encoding sequences 
Other mechanisms: !capable of accepting electrons from! Photosystem I
