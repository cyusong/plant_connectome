['15878881', 'Nudix hydrolases are a family of proteins that catalyze the hydrolysis of a  variety of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. Twenty-four genes of the Nudix  hydrolase homologues (AtNUDTs) with predicted localizations in the cytosol,  chloroplasts, and mitochondria exist in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we  demonstrated the comprehensive analysis of nine types of cytosolic AtNUDT  proteins (AtNUDT1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -7, -9, -10, and -11). The recombinant  proteins of AtNUDT2, -6, -7, and -10 showed both ADP-ribose and NADH  pyrophosphatase activities with significantly high affinities compared with those  of animal and yeast enzymes. The expression of each AtNUDT is individually  regulated in different tissues. These findings suggest that most cytosolic  AtNUDTs may substantially function in the sanitization of potentially hazardous  ADP-ribose and the regulation of the cellular NADH/NAD(+) ratio in plant cells.  On the other hand, the AtNUDT1 protein had the ability to hydrolyze 8-oxo-dGTP  with a K(m) value of 6.8 mum and completely suppress the increased frequency of  spontaneous mutations in the Escherichia coli mutT(-) strain, indicating that  AtNUDT1 is a functional homologue of E. coli MutT in A. thaliana and is involved  in the prevention of spontaneous mutation. The results obtained here suggest that  the plant Nudix family has evolved in a specific manner that differs from that of  yeast and humans.', '2005 Jul 1', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M503536200', 'Shigeoka']
