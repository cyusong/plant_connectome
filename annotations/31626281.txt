Following exposure to water, mature Arabidopsis seeds are surrounded by a gelatinous capsule, termed mucilage. The mucilage consists of pectin-rich polysaccharides, which are produced in epidermal cells of the seed coat. Although pectin is a major component of plant cell walls, its biosynthesis and biological functions are not fully understood. Previously, we reported that a transmembrane RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, FLYING SAUCER 1 (FLY1) regulates the degree of pectin methyl esterification for mucilage capsule formation. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single FLY1 homolog, FLY2. In this study, we show that the FLY2 protein functions in mucilage modification together with FLY1. FLY2 was expressed in seed coat epidermal cells during mucilage synthesis, but its expression level was much lower than that of FLY1. While fly2 showed no obvious difference in mucilage capsule formation from wild type, the fly1 fly2 double mutants showed more severe defects in mucilage than fly1 alone. FLY2-EYFP that was expressed under the control of the FLY1 promoter rescued fly1 mucilage, showing that FLY2 has the same molecular function as FLY1. FLY2-EYFP colocalized with marker proteins of Golgi apparatus (sialyltransferase-mRFP) and late endosome (mRFP-ARA7), indicating that as FLY1, FLY2 controls pectin modification by functioning in these endomembrane organelles. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggests that FLY1 and FLY2 originated from a common ancestral gene by gene duplication prior to the emergence of Brassicaceae. Taken together, our findings suggest that FLY2 functions in the Golgi apparatus and/or the late endosome of seed coat epidermal cells in a manner similar to FLY1.
