['25934507', 'Plants flower in an appropriate season to allow sufficient vegetative development  and position flower development in favorable environments. In Arabidopsis,  CONSTANS (CO) and FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT F-BOX1 (FKF1) promote flowering by  inducing FLOWER LOCUS T (FT) expression in the long-day afternoon. The CO protein  is present in the morning but could not activate FT expression due to unknown  negative mechanisms, which prevent premature flowering before the day length  reaches a threshold. Here, we report that TARGET OF EAT1 (TOE1) and related  proteins interact with the activation domain of CO and CO-like (COL) proteins and  inhibit CO activity. TOE1 binds to the FT promoter near the CO-binding site, and  reducing TOE function results in a morning peak of the FT mRNA. In addition, TOE1  interacts with the LOV domain of FKF1 and likely interferes with the FKF1-CO  interaction, resulting in partial degradation of the CO protein in the afternoon  to prevent premature flowering.', '2015 May 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.251520.114', 'Ma']
