['11156607', 'The cell wall is an important determinant of plant cell form. Here we define a  class of Arabidopsis root hair mutants with defective cell walls. Plants  homozygous for kojak (kjk) mutations initiate root hairs that rupture at their  tip soon after initiation. The KJK gene was isolated by positional cloning, and  its identity was confirmed by the molecular complementation of the Kjk(-)  phenotype and the sequence of three kjk mutant alleles. KOJAK encodes a cellulose  synthase-like protein, AtCSLD3. KOJAK/AtCSLD3 is the first member of this  subfamily of proteins to be shown to have a function in cell growth. Subcellular  localization of the KOJAK/AtCSLD3 protein using a GFP fusion shows that  KOJAK/AtCSLD3 is located on the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that  KOJAK/AtCSLD3 is required for the synthesis of a noncellulosic wall  polysaccharide. Consistent with the cell specific defect in the roots of kjk  mutants, KOJAK/AtCSDL3 is preferentially expressed in hair cells of the  epidermis. The Kjk(-) phenotype and the pattern of KOJAK/AtCSLD3 expression  suggest that this gene acts early in the process of root hair outgrowth. These  results suggest that KOJAK/AtCSLD3 is involved in the biosynthesis of  beta-glucan-containing polysaccharides that are required during root hair  elongation.', '2001 Jan 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.188801', 'Dolan']
