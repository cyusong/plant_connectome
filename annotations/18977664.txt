['18977664', 'Triterpene skeletons are produced by oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs). The genome  sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed the presence of thirteen OSC  homologous genes including At1g78950, which has been revised recently as two  independent ORFs, namely At1g78950 and At1g78955. The cDNA corresponding to the  revised At1g78950 was obtained by RT-PCR, ligated into Saccharomyces cerevisiae  expression vector pYES2, and expressed in a lanosterol synthase deficient S.  cerevisiae strain. LC-MS and NMR analyses of the accumulated product in the host  cells showed that the product of At1g78950 is beta-amyrin, indicating that  At1g78950 encodes a beta-amyrin synthase (EC 5.4.99.-).', '2009 Jan', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2008.09.007', 'Ebizuka']
