Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> ) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> ) are major inorganic nitrogen (N) sources for plants. When serving as the sole or dominant N supply, NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> often causes root inhibition and shoot chlorosis in plants, known as ammonium toxicity. NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> usually causes no toxicity and can mitigate ammonium toxicity even at low concentrations, referred to as nitrate-dependent alleviation of ammonium toxicity. Our previous studies indicated a NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> efflux channel SLAH3 is involved in this process. However, whether additional components contribute to NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> -mediated NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> detoxification is unknown. Previously, mutations in NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> transporter NRT1.1 were shown to cause enhanced resistance to high concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> . Whereas, in this study, we found when the high-NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> medium was supplemented with low concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> , nrt1.1 mutant plants showed hyper-sensitive phenotype instead. Furthermore, mutation in NRT1.1 caused enhanced medium acidification under high-NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> /low-NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> condition, suggesting NRT1.1 regulates ammonium toxicity by facilitating H<sup>+</sup> uptake. Moreover, NRT1.1 was shown to interact with SLAH3 to form a transporter-channel complex. Interestingly, SLAH3 appeared to affect NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> influx while NRT1.1 influenced NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> efflux, suggesting NRT1.1 and SLAH3 regulate each other at protein and/or gene expression levels. Our study thus revealed NRT1.1 and SLAH3 form a functional unit to regulate nitrate-dependent alleviation of ammonium toxicity through regulating NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> transport and balancing rhizosphere acidification.
