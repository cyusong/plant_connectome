Appropriate embryonic patterning is amongst the most fundamental processes in plant development, necessary for the correct specification of root and shoot apical meristems which generate all post-germination organs of a plant. Many mutations have been characterized which disrupt embryonic pattern formation and many recent studies have focussed on the role of auxin in establishing apical-basal polarity. Our recent work has demonstrated the role of two redundant AP2 transcription factors, DORNROESCHEN (DRN) and DORNROESCHEN-LIKE (DRNL) in the control of embryo patterning, upstream of auxin perception and/or response and that DRN in turn, is regulated by auxin. We also suggest both genes are involved in the change from radial to bilateral symmetry in the globular embryo and are responsible for positional information of meristem-specific genes such as STM. The promiscuous interaction of DRN and DRNL proteins with the redundant family of class III HD-ZIP partners may represent a way by which embryonic cell specification can be controlled by combinations of transcription factor complexes, together with auxin.
