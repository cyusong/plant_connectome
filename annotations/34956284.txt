<i>Tylosema esculentum</i> (marama bean), a wild legume from tropical Africa, has long been considered as a potential crop for local farmers due to its rich nutritional value. Genomics research of marama is indispensable for the domestication and varietal improvement of the bean. The chloroplast genome of marama has been sequenced and assembled previously using a hybrid approach based on both Illumina and PacBio data. In this study, a similar method was used to assemble the mitochondrial genome of marama. The mitochondrial genome of the experimental individual has been confirmed to have two large circles OK638188 and OK638189, which do not recombine according to the data. However, they may be able to restructure into five smaller circles through recombination on the 4 pairs of long repeats (>1 kb). The total length of marama mitogenome is 399,572 bp. A 9,798 bp DNA fragment has been found that is homologous to the chloroplast genome of marama, accounting for 2.5% of the mitogenome. In the Fabaceae family, the mitogenome of <i>Millettia pinnata</i> is highly similar to marama, including for both the genes present and the total size. Some genes including <i>cox2, rpl10, rps1</i>, and <i>sdh4</i> have been lost during the evolution of angiosperms and are absent in the mitogenomes of some legumes. However, these remain intact and functional in marama. Another set of genes, <i>rpl2, rps2, rps7, rps11</i>, <i>rps13</i>, and <i>rps19</i> are either absent, or present as pseudogenes, in the mitogenome of marama.
