Epialleles, the heritable epigenetic variants that are not caused by changes in DNA sequences, can broaden genetic and phenotypic diversity and benefit to crop breeding, but very few epialleles related to agricultural traits have been identified in maize. Here, we cloned a small kernel mutant, smk-wl10, from maize, which encoded a tubulin-folding cofactor B (ZmTFCB) protein. Expression of the ZmTFCB gene decreased in the smk-wl10 mutant, which arrested embryo, endosperm and basal endosperm transfer layer developments. Overexpression of ZmTFCB could complement the defective phenotype of smk-wl10. No nucleotide sequence variation in ZmTFCB could be found between smk-wl10 and wild type (WT). Instead, we detected hypermethylation of nucleotide CHG (where H is A, C or T nucleotide) sequence contexts and increased level of histone H3K9me2 methylation in the upstream sequence of ZmTFCB in smk-wl10 compared with WT, which might respond to the attenuating transcription of ZmTFCB. In addition, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays identified a strong interaction between ZmTFCB and its homolog ZmTFCE. Thus, our work identifies a novel epiallele of the maize ZmTFCB gene, which might represent a common phenomenon in the epigenetic regulation of important traits such as kernel development in maize.
