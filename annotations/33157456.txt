Generally, the caryopses located on proximal secondary branches (CSB) have smaller grain size and slower and poorer filling rate than those on apical primary branches (CPB) in rice, which greatly limits the grain yield potential fulfillment. However, the key regulators determining the developmental differences between CPB and CSB remain elusive. Here, we have performed transcriptomic analysis in CPB and CSB at four developmental stages [0, 5, 12 and 20 days after fertilization (DAF)] using high-throughput RNA-sequencing technique. Based on gene expression cluster analysis, the genes expressed in CPB and CSB were clustered into two subtypes in a positional-independent manner: one includes 0- and 5-DAF CPB and CSB, and 12-DAF CSB; another includes 12-DAF CPB, 20-DAF CPB and CSB. Moreover, according to the expression value of each gene, K-mean cluster analysis showed that the K4 to K6 classifiers contain the genes highly expressed in 5-DAF CPB and 12-DAF CSB, which were enriched in DNA synthesis, protein synthesis and cell proliferation mainly responsible for grain size decision. Then, functional enrichment analysis in Gene Ontology database showed that auxin-related genes were relatively enriched, indicating that auxin might be the key determinant for gene expression in K4 to K6 classifiers. Finally, the application of exogenous IAA in CSB before fertilization promoted gene expression, caryopsis development and grain weight closer to that in CPB, providing a molecular framework to optimize CSB development and potential targets for increasing grain yield.
