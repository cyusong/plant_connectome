Understanding the genetic basis of the node of the first fruiting branch (NFFB) improves early-maturity cotton breeding. Here we report QTL mapping on 200 F<sub>2</sub> plants and derivative F<sub>2:3</sub> and F<sub>2:4</sub> populations by genotyping by sequencing (GBS). BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub> population was constructed by backcrossing one F<sub>2:4</sub> line with the maternal parent JF914 and used for BSA-seq for further QTL mapping. A total of 1,305,642 SNPs were developed between the parents by GBS, and 2,907,790 SNPs were detected by BSA-seq. A high-density genetic map was constructed containing 11,488 SNPs and spanning 4,202.12 cM in length. A total of 13 QTL were mapped in the 3 tested populations. JF914 conferred favorable alleles for 11 QTL, and JF173 conferred favorable alleles for the other 2 QTL. Two stable QTL were repeatedly mapped in F<sub>2:3</sub> and F<sub>2:4,</sub> including <i>qNFFB-D3-1</i> and <i>qNFFB-D6-1</i>. Only <i>qNFFB-D3-1</i> contributed more than 10% of the phenotypic variation. This QTL covered about 24.7 Mb (17,130,008-41,839,226 bp) on chromosome D3. Two regions on D3 (41,779,195-41,836,120 bp, 41,836,768-41,872,287 bp) were found by BSA-seq and covered about 92.4 Kb. This 92.4 Kb region overlapped with the stable QTL <i>qNFFB-D3-1</i> and contained 8 annotated genes. By qRT-PCR, <i>Ghir_D03G012430</i> showed a lower expression level from the 1- to 2-leaf stage and a higher expression level from the 3- to 6-leaf stage in the buds of JF173 than that of JF914. <i>Ghir_D03G012390</i> reached the highest level at the 3- and 5-leaf stages in the buds of JF173 and JF914, respectively. As JF173 has lower NFFB and more early maturity than JF914, these two genes might be important in cell division and differentiation during NFFB formation in the seedling stage. The results of this study will facilitate a better understanding of the genetic basis of NFFB and benefit cotton molecular breeding for improving earliness traits.
