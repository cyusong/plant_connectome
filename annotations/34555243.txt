Ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ) is a damaging air pollutant to crops. As one of the most reactive oxidants known, O<sub>3</sub> rapidly forms other reactive oxygen species (ROS) once it enters leaves through stomata. Those ROS in turn can cause oxidative stress, reduce photosynthesis, accelerate senescence, and decrease crop yield. To improve and adapt our feed, fuel, and food supply to rising O<sub>3</sub> pollution, a number of Free Air Concentration Enrichment (O<sub>3</sub> -FACE) facilities have been developed around the world and have studied key staple crops. In this review, we provide an overview of the FACE facilities and highlight some of the lessons learned from the last two decades of research. We discuss the differences between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> crop responses to elevated O<sub>3</sub> , the possible trade-off between productivity and protection, genetic variation in O<sub>3</sub> response within and across species, and how we might leverage this observed variation for crop improvement. We also highlight the need to improve understanding of the interaction between rising O<sub>3</sub> pollution and other aspects of climate change, notably drought. Finally, we propose the use of globally modeled O<sub>3</sub> data that are available at increasing spatial and temporal resolutions to expand upon the research conducted at the limited number of global O<sub>3</sub> -FACE facilities.
