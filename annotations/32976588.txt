Plants are aerobic organisms that have evolved to maintain specific requirements for oxygen (O2), leading to a correct respiratory energy supply during growth and development. There are certain plant developmental cues and biotic or abiotic stress responses where O2 is scarce. This O2 deprivation known as hypoxia may occur in hypoxic niches of plant-specific tissues and during adverse environmental cues such as pathogen attack and flooding. In general, plants respond to hypoxia through a complex reprogramming of their molecular activities with the aim of reducing the impact of stress on their physiological and cellular homeostasis. This review focuses on the fine-tuned regulation of hypoxia triggered by a network of gaseous compounds that includes O2, ethylene, and nitric oxide. In view of recent scientific advances, we summarize the molecular mechanisms mediated by phytoglobins and by the N-degron proteolytic pathway, focusing on embryogenesis, seed imbibition, and germination, and also specific structures, most notably root apical and shoot apical meristems. In addition, those biotic and abiotic stresses that comprise hypoxia are also highlighted.
