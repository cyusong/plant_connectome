['26095447', 'We previously reported that a near-null magnetic field suppressed Arabidopsis  flowering in white light, which might be related to the function modification of  cryptochrome (CRY). To further demonstrate that the effect of near-null magnetic  field on Arabidopsis flowering is associated with CRY, Arabidopsis wild type and  CRY mutant plants were grown in the near-null magnetic field under blue or red  light with different light cycle and photosynthetic photon flux density. We found  that Arabidopsis flowering was significantly suppressed by near-null magnetic  field in blue light with lower intensity (10 micromol/m(2) /s) and shorter cycle  (12 h period: 6 h light/6 h dark). However, flowering time of CRY1/CRY2 mutants  did not show any difference between plants grown in near-null magnetic field and  in local geomagnetic field under detected light conditions. In red light, no  significant difference was shown in Arabidopsis flowering between plants in  near-null magnetic field and local geomagnetic field under detected light cycles  and intensities. These results suggest that changes of blue light cycle and  intensity alter the effect of near-null magnetic field on Arabidopsis flowering,  which is mediated by CRY.', '2015 Sep', 'Bioelectromagnetics', '10.1002/bem.21927', 'Wei']
