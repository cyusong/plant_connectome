Utilising resistance (<i>R</i>) genes, such as <i>LepR1</i>, against <i>Leptosphaeria maculans</i>, the causal agent of blackleg in canola (<i>Brassica napus</i>), could help manage the disease in the field and increase crop yield. Here we present a genome wide association study (GWAS) in <i>B. napus</i> to identify <i>LepR1</i> candidate genes. Disease phenotyping of 104 <i>B. napus</i> genotypes revealed 30 resistant and 74 susceptible lines. Whole genome re-sequencing of these cultivars yielded over 3 million high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). GWAS in mixed linear model (MLM) revealed a total of 2,166 significant SNPs associated with <i>LepR1</i> resistance. Of these SNPs, 2108 (97%) were found on chromosome A02 of <i>B. napus</i> cv. Darmor bzh v9 with a delineated <i>LepR1</i>_mlm1 QTL at 15.11-26.08 Mb. In <i>LepR1</i>_mlm1, there are 30 resistance gene analogs (RGAs) (13 nucleotide-binding site-leucine rich repeats (NLRs), 12 receptor-like kinases (RLKs), and 5 transmembrane-coiled-coil (TM-CCs)). Sequence analysis of alleles in resistant and susceptible lines was undertaken to identify candidate genes. This research provides insights into blackleg resistance in <i>B. napus</i> and assists identification of the functional <i>LepR1</i> blackleg resistance gene.
