Proteins of the Nitrate Transporter 1/Peptide Transporter (NPF) family transport a diverse variety of substrates, such as nitrate, peptides, hormones and chloride. In this study, a systematic analysis of the tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) <i>NPF</i> family was performed in the cultivated 'K326'. In total, 143 <i>NtNPF</i> genes were identified and phylogenetically classified into eight subfamilies, NPF1 to NPF8, based on the classification of NPF families in other plant species. The chromosomal locations and structures of the <i>NtNPF</i> genes were analyzed. The expression profiles of <i>NtNPF</i> genes under NaCl stress were analyzed to screen the possible <i>NPF</i> genes involving in chloride regulation in tobacco. Most <i>NtNPF6</i> genes responded to salt stress in the roots and leaves. The expression of <i>NtNPF6.13</i> was significantly down-regulated after salt stress for 12h. The chloride content was reduced in the roots of <i>ntnpf6.13</i> mutant. These findings support the participation of <i>NtNPF6.13</i> in chloride uptake. Several other <i>NtNPF</i> genes that play potential roles in chloride metabolism of tobacco require further study.
