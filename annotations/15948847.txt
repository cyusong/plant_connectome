The A-genome group in Oryza consists of eight diploid species and is distributed world-wide. Here we reconstructed the phylogeny among the A-genome species based on sequences of nuclear genes and MITE (miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements) insertions. Thirty-seven accessions representing two cultivated and six wild species from the A-genome group were sampled. Introns of four nuclear single-copy genes on different chromosomes were sequenced and analysed by both maximum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference methods. All the species except for Oryza rufipogon and Oryza nivara formed a monophyletic group and the Australian endemic Oryza meridionalis was the earliest divergent lineage. Two subspecies of Oryza sativa (ssp. indica and ssp. japonica) formed two separate monophyletic groups, suggestive of their polyphyletic origin. Based on molecular clock approach, we estimated that the divergence of the A-genome group occurred c. 2.0 million years ago (mya) while the two subspecies (indica and japonica) separated c. 0.4 mya. Intron sequences of nuclear genes provide sufficient resolution and are informative for phylogenetic inference at lower taxonomic levels.
