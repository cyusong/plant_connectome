When membrane proteins and secretory proteins are misfolded or incompletely folded, they are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for further folding or degradation. The HMG-COA reductase degradation 1 (HRD1) and degradation of alpha2 10 (DOA10) complexes are two major components involved in the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system in eukaryotic organisms(1-4). However, the relationship between these two complexes is largely unknown, especially in higher eukaryotes. Here, we report that the plant ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 32 (UBC32), an ER-bound E2 working in the DOA10 complex, is maintained at low levels under standard conditions by proteasome-dependent degradation mediated by the HRD1 complex, the other E3 complex involved in ERAD. Loss of this negative regulation under ER stress increases capacity for degradation of misfolded proteins retained in the ER. Consistently, UBE2J1, the homologue of UBC32 in mammals, was also identified to be targeted by HRD1 for degradation. Taken together, these results suggest that the regulation of UBC32 (or UBE2J1) by the HRD1 complex is conserved between plants and mammals.
