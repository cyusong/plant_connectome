['19846542', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P(2)] is a phospholipid that  has a role in controlling membrane trafficking events in yeast and animal cells.  The function of this lipid in plants is unknown, although its synthesis has been  shown to be up-regulated upon osmotic stress in plant cells. PtdIns(3,5)P(2) is  synthesized by the PIKfyve/Fab1 family of proteins, with two orthologs, FAB1A and  FAB1B, being present in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In this study, we  attempt to address the role of this lipid by analyzing the phenotypes of plants  mutated in FAB1A and FAB1B. It was not possible to generate plants homozygous for  mutations in both genes, although single mutants were isolated. Both homozygous  single mutant plant lines exhibited a leaf curl phenotype that was more marked in  FAB1B mutants. Genetic transmission analysis revealed that failure to generate  double mutant lines was entirely due to inviability of pollen carrying mutant  alleles of both FAB1A and FAB1B. This pollen displayed severe defects in vacuolar  reorganization following the first mitotic division of development. The presence  of abnormally large vacuoles in pollen at the tricellular stage resulted in the  collapse of the majority of grains carrying both mutant alleles. This  demonstrates a crucial role for PtdIns(3,5)P(2) in modulating the dynamics of  vacuolar rearrangement essential for successful pollen development. Taken  together, our results are consistent with PtdIns(3,5)P(2) production being  central to cellular responses to changes in osmotic conditions.', '2009 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.146159', 'Doughty']
