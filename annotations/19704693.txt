The interaction of plants with bacterial pathogens involves the manipulation of programmed cell death (PCD) pathways. During a resistance interaction PCD is induced in a process termed the hypersensitive response (HR) which may function to limit pathogen spread. In a susceptible plant-pathogen interactions, the pathogen both inhibits and/or induces host PCD depending on the infection stage and lifestyle of the pathogen. Genes/pathways regulating PCD in plants have been difficult to identify due to a lack of homologous sequences in plants for mammalian genes that control apoptosis and possibly due to functional redundancy. Our labs study plant PCD pathways and bacterial speck disease in tomato which is caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst). We recently identified the tomato protein kinases Pdk1 and Adi3 as negative regulators of plant PCD. The plant Pdk1/Adi3 pathway appears to function similarly to the Pdk1/PKB (Akt) pathway in mammals which functions as a major apoptosis negative regulation pathway. Here we discuss regulation of Pdk1/Adi3 and targeting of this pathway during the tomato-Pst interaction for modulation of host PCD.

Pdk1: !regulates! PCD
Adi3: !regulates! PCD
Pdk1/Adi3: !functions similarly to! Pdk1/PKB (Akt)
Tomato-Pst: !targets! Pdk1/Adi3
