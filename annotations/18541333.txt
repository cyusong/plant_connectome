A rapid, sensitive fluorescence method was applied here for detection of oxidized tocopherol quinones in total plant tissue extracts using HPLC, employing a post-column reduction of these compounds by a Zn column. Using this method, we were able to detect both alpha- and gamma-tocopherol quinones in Chlamydomonas reinhardii with a very high degree of sensitivity. The levels of both compounds increased under high light stress in the presence of pyrazolate in parallel to a decrease in the content of the corresponding tocopherols. The formation of tocopherol quinones from tocopherols was apparently due to their oxidation by singlet oxygen, which is formed in photosystem II under high light stress. alpha-Tocopherol quinone was also detected in a variety of higher plants of different age, and its level was found to increase during senescence in leaves grown under natural conditions. In contrast to alpha-tocopherol quinone, gamma-tocopherol quinone was not found in the higher plant species investigated with the exception of young runner bean leaves, where the levels of both compounds increased dramatically during cold and light stress. Taking advantage of native fluorescence of the reduced alpha-tocopherol quinone (alpha-tocopherol quinol), it can be detected in plant tissue extracts with a high sensitivity. In young runner bean leaves, alpha-tocopherol quinol was found at a level similar to alpha-tocopherol.
