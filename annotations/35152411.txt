Cellular and genetic understanding of the rice leaf size regulation is limited, despite rice being the staple food of more than half of the global population. We investigated the mechanism controlling the rice leaf length using cultivated and wild rice accessions that remarkably differed for leaf size. Comparative transcriptomics, gibberellic acid (GA) quantification and leaf kinematics of the contrasting accessions suggested the involvement of GA, cell cycle and growth-regulating factors (GRFs) in the rice leaf size regulation. Zone-specific expression analysis and VIGS established the functions of specific GRFs in the process. The leaf length of the selected accessions was strongly correlated with GA levels. Higher GA content in wild rice accessions with longer leaves and GA-induced increase in the leaf length via an increase in cell division confirmed a GA-mediated regulation of division zone in rice. Downstream to GA, OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 function for controlling cell division to determine the rice leaf length. Spatial control of cell division to determine the division zone size mediated by GA and downstream OsGRF7 and OsGRF8 explains the leaf length differences between the cultivated and wild rice. This mechanism to control the rice leaf length might have contributed to optimizing leaf size during domestication.
