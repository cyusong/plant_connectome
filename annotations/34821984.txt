['34821984', 'A pollen specific homolog to a xyloglucan galactosyltransferase regulates cell  wall stability and therefore pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis. In angiosperms,  pollen tubes grow through the transmitting tract to deliver the sperm cells to  the ovule for fertilization. Fast growing pollen tubes coordinate the synthesis,  secretion and assembly of cell wall components to maintain the mechanical  properties of the cell wall. Xyloglucan, the major hemicellulosic polysaccharide  in the primary cell wall, tethers cellulose to form the complexed cell wall  network through its side chain modifications. How the side chain modifications of  the xyloglucan regulate the pollen tube cell wall strength and growth remains  elusive. Here we found that AtGT11, a MUR3 xyloglucan galactosyltransferase  homolog highly expressed in pollen regulated the cell wall stability of pollen  tubes. Genetic analysis of the gt11 and the xylosyltransferase 1/2 mutant  indicated that the xylosylation of XyG side chains played dominant role while  galactosylation of the XyG side chains finely modified the cell wall mechanics.', '2021 Nov 25', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-021-03779-x', 'ORCID:']
