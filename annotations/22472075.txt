Forage and turf grasses are utilized in diverse environments that expose them to a variety of abiotic stresses, however very little is known concerning the perception or molecular responses to these various stresses. In the model grass species Lolium temulentum, a 46kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was activated in the leaf within 10min of exposing the roots to salt stress. When plants were subjected cold stress, no significant activation of the MAPK was observed. However, the 46kDa MAPK was rapidly activated in the leaves of plants within 3min of exposure to heat stress. Previously, mechanical wounding has been shown to rapidly activate a 46kDa and a 44kDa MAPK in L. temulentum. The wound activation of the MAPKs was delayed and diminished in plants undergoing cold treatment. In plants subjected simultaneously to 40°C and wounding, the activation of the 46kDa MAPK was enhanced. However if plants were subjected to heat and cold stress for more than 2h or exposed to 300mM NaCl for 24h prior to wounding, the wound activation of the 46kDa and a 44kDa MAPKs were significantly inhibited. These results suggest that the 46kDa MAPK plays a role in the response to various environmental stimuli.
