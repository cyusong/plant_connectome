['18682547', 'Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a ubiquitous transcription factor composed of three  distinct subunits (NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC). We found that the Arabidopsis  thaliana NFYA5 transcript is strongly induced by drought stress in an abscisic  acid (ABA)-dependent manner. Promoter:beta-glucuronidase analyses showed that  NFYA5 was highly expressed in vascular tissues and guard cells and that part of  the induction by drought was transcriptional. NFYA5 contains a target site for  miR169, which targets mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. We found  that miR169 was downregulated by drought stress through an ABA-dependent pathway.  Analysis of the expression of miR169 precursors showed that miR169a and miR169c  were substantially downregulated by drought stress. Coexpression of miR169 and  NFYA5 suggested that miR169a was more efficient than miR169c at repressing the  NFYA5 mRNA level. nfya5 knockout plants and plants overexpressing miR169a showed  enhanced leaf water loss and were more sensitive to drought stress than wild-type  plants. By contrast, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing NFYA5 displayed  reduced leaf water loss and were more resistant to drought stress than the wild  type. Microarray analysis indicated that NFYA5 is crucial for the expression of a  number of drought stress-responsive genes. Thus, NFYA5 is important for drought  resistance, and its induction by drought stress occurs at both the  transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.', '2008 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.059444', 'Zhu']
