Stomatal pores and the leaf cuticle regulate evaporation from the plant body and balance the tradeoff between photosynthesis and water loss. MYB16, encoding a transcription factor involved in cutin biosynthesis, is expressed in stomatal lineage ground cells, suggesting a link between cutin biosynthesis and stomatal development. Here, we show that the downregulation of MYB16 in meristemoids is directly mediated by the stomatal master transcription factor SPEECHLESS (SPCH) in Arabidopsis thaliana. The suppression of MYB16 before an asymmetric division is crucial for stomatal patterning, as its overexpression or ectopic expression in meristemoids increased stomatal density and resulted in the formation of stomatal clusters, as well as affecting the outer cell wall structure. Expressing a cutinase gene in plants ectopically expressing MYB16 reduced stomatal clustering, suggesting that cutin affects stomatal signaling or the polarity setup in asymmetrically dividing cells. The clustered stomatal phenotype was rescued by overexpressing EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR2, suggesting that stomatal signaling was still functional in these plants. Growing seedlings ectopically expressing MYB16 on high-percentage agar plates to modulate tensile strength rescued the polarity and stomatal cluster defects of these seedlings. Therefore, the inhibition of MYB16 expression by SPCH in the early stomatal lineage is required to correctly place the polarity protein needed for stomatal patterning during leaf morphogenesis.
