['14731265', 'We describe the use of a secreted form of Aequoria victoria green fluorescent  protein (secGFP) in a non-invasive live cell assay of membrane traffic in  Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that in comparison to GFP-HDEL, which accumulates  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), secGFP generates a weak fluorescence signal  when transported to the apoplast. The fluorescence of secGFP in the apoplast can  be increased by growth of seedlings on culture medium buffered at pH 8.1,  suggesting that apoplastic pH is responsible, at least in part, for the low  fluorescence intensity of seedlings expressing secGFP. Inhibition of secGFP  transport between the ER and plasma membrane (PM), either by Brefeldin A (BFA)  treatment or by genetic intervention results in increased intracellular secGFP  accumulation accompanied by an increase in the secGFP fluorescence intensity.  secGFP thus provides a valuable tool for forward and reverse genetic analysis of  membrane traffic and endomembrane organisation in Arabidopsis. Using this assay  for quantitative sublethal perturbation of secGFP transport, we identify a role  for root hair defective 3 (RHD3) in transport of secreted and Golgi markers  between the ER and the Golgi apparatus.', '2004 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01969.x', 'Moore']
