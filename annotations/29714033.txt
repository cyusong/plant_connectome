Plant immune receptors enable detection of a multitude of microbes including pathogens. The recognition of microbes activates various plant signaling pathways, such as those mediated by phytohormones. Over the course of coevolution with microbes, plants have expanded their repertoire of immune receptors and signaling components, resulting in highly interconnected plant immune networks. These immune networks enable plants to appropriately respond to different types of microbes and to coordinate immune responses with developmental programs and environmental stress responses. However, the interconnectivity in plant immune networks is exploited by microbial pathogens to promote pathogen fitness in plants. Analogous to plant immune networks, virulence-related pathways in bacterial pathogens are also interconnected. Accumulating evidence implies that some plant-derived compounds target bacterial virulence networks. Thus, the plant immune and bacterial virulence networks intimately interact with each other. Here, we highlight recent insights into the structures of the plant immune and bacterial virulence networks and the interactions between them. We propose that small molecules derived from plants and/or bacterial pathogens connect the two molecular networks, forming supernetworks in the plant-bacterial pathogen holobiont.
