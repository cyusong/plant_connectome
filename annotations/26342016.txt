['26342016', 'Prior to the release of their cargoes into the vacuolar lumen, sorting endosomes  mature into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) through the action of ENDOSOMAL COMPLEX  REQUIRED FOR TRANSPORT (ESCRT) protein complexes. MVB-mediated sorting of  high-affinity phosphate transporters (PHT1) to the vacuole limits their plasma  membrane levels under phosphate-sufficient conditions, a process that allows  plants to maintain phosphate homeostasis. Here, we describe ALIX, a cytosolic  protein that associates with MVB by interacting with ESCRT-III subunit SNF7 and  mediates PHT1;1 trafficking to the vacuole in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that  the partial loss-of-function mutant alix-1 displays reduced vacuolar degradation  of PHT1;1. ALIX derivatives containing the alix-1 mutation showed reduced  interaction with SNF7, providing a simple molecular explanation for impaired  cargo trafficking in alix-1 mutants. In fact, the alix-1 mutation also hampered  vacuolar sorting of the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1. We also show that alix-1  displays altered vacuole morphogenesis, implying a new role for ALIX proteins in  vacuolar biogenesis, likely acting as part of ESCRT-III complexes. In line with a  presumed broad target spectrum, the alix-1 mutation is pleiotropic, leading to  reduced plant growth and late flowering, with stronger alix mutations being  lethal, indicating that ALIX participates in diverse processes in plants  essential for their life.', '2015 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00393', 'ORCID:']
