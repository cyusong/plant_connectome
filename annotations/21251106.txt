TERMINAL FLOWER2 (TFL2) is the plant homologue of metazoan HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (HP1) protein family. It is known that, unlike most HP1 proteins, TFL2 does not primarily localize to heterochromatin; instead it functions in regulation of specific genes in euchromatic regions. We show that the tfl2 mutant has a lower rate of auxin biosynthesis, resulting in low levels of auxin. In line with this, tfl2 mutants have lower levels of expression of auxin response genes and retain an auxin response. The reduced rate of auxin biosynthesis in tfl2 is correlated to the down-regulation of specific genes in the tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis pathway, a sub-set of the YUCCA genes. In vivo, TFL2 is targeted to a number of the YUCCA genes in an auxin-dependent fashion revealing a role of TFL2 in auxin regulation, probably as a component of protein complexes affecting transcriptional control.
