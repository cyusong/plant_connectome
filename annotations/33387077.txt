AFM, profilometry and SEM measurements on both sides of the Anacardium occidentale L. leaf reveal that ultrastructure presented some singularities due to their different morphologies and roughness. The advanced stereometry and power spectrum density of both sides of the Anacardium occidentale L. leaf were carefully studied. We use three different microscopy techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, profilometry, and atomic force microscopy for a complete description of the leaf surface morphology. The morphology of the adaxial and abaxial sides revealed a surface composed of striated cuticles and stomata cells, respectively. The height parameters obtained by profilometry revealed that the abaxial side was rougher. However, both sides presented similar Gaussian height distribution and asymmetry. The advanced stereometric parameters obtained by the topographic maps of AFM revealed that the two sides have some singularities due to their different morphologies and roughness, but with similar microtextures. However, average PSD spectra showed that adaxial and abaxial sides are dominated by relatively low and high spatial frequencies, showing that the microtextures, unlike what was shown in stereometric parameters, are different. These results revealed that leaves surface morphology under different aspects and scales and the quantitative parameters confirmed the different spatial patterns displayed, which can be of great interest for the study of the biological behavior of plants from their leaves.
