The long period of reciprocal antagonistic coevolution between some insect and plant species has led to the development of plant surface attributes that reduce insect attachment. These features serve as a defence against herbivores, sap-sucking insects and nectar robbers, contribute to a temporary capture of insect pollinators, and prevent the escape of insects from traps of carnivorous plants. This review summarises the literature on attachment-mediated insect-plant interactions. A short introduction to attachment systems of insects is presented and the effect of three-dimensional epicuticular waxes on insect attachment is illustrated by many examples. Special attention is given to the mechanisms of the anti-attachment properties of plant wax structures (the roughness hypothesis, the contamination hypothesis, the fluid-adsorption hypothesis, and the wax-dissolving hypothesis) and their ecological implications.
