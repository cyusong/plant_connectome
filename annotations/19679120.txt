['19679120', 'Actin-related protein 5 (ARP5) is a conserved subunit of the INO80  chromatin-remodeling complex in yeast and mammals. We have characterized the  expression and subcellular distribution of Arabidopsis thaliana ARP5 and explored  its role in the epigenetic control of multicellular development and DNA repair.  ARP5-specific monoclonal antibodies localized ARP5 protein to the nucleoplasm of  interphase cells in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana tabacum. ARP5 promoter-reporter  fusions and the ARP5 protein are ubiquitously expressed. A null mutant and a  severe knockdown allele produced moderately dwarfed plants with all organs  smaller than the wild type. The small and slightly deformed organs such as leaves  and hypocotyls were composed of small-sized cells. The ratio of leaf stomata to  epidermal cells was high in the mutant, which also exhibited a delayed stomatal  development compared with the wild type. Mutant plants were hypersensitive to  DNA-damaging reagents including hydroxyurea, methylmethane sulfonate, and  bleocin, demonstrating a role for ARP5 in DNA repair. Interestingly, the  hypersensitivity phenotype of ARP5 null allele arp5-1 is stronger than the severe  knockdown allele arp5-2. Moreover, a wild-type transgene fully complemented all  developmental and DNA repair mutant phenotypes. Despite the common participation  of both ARP4 and ARP5 in the INO80 complex, ARP4- and ARP5-deficient plants  displayed only a small subset of common phenotypes and each displayed novel  phenotypes, suggesting that in Arabidopsis they have both shared and unique  functions.', '2009 Nov 1', 'Dev Biol', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.08.006', 'Meagher']
