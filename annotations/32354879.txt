Plants make many biologically active, specialized metabolites, which vary in structure, biosynthesis, and the processes they influence. An increasing number of these compounds are documented to protect plants from insects, pathogens, or herbivores or to mediate interactions with beneficial organisms, including pollinators and nitrogen-fixing microbes. Acylsugars, one class of protective compounds, are made in glandular trichomes of plants across the Solanaceae family. While most described acylsugars are acylsucroses, published examples also include acylsugars with hexose cores. The South American fruit crop naranjilla (lulo; <i>Solanum quitoense</i>) produces acylsugars containing a myoinositol core. We identified an enzyme that acetylates triacylinositols, a function homologous to the last step in the acylsucrose biosynthetic pathway of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). Our analysis reveals parallels between <i>S. lycopersicum</i> acylsucrose and <i>S. quitoense</i> acylinositol biosynthesis, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.
