We demonstrate that the C-terminus of OsCDC48 is essential for maintaining its full ATPase activity and OsCDC48/48E interaction is required to modulate cellular processes and plant survival in rice. Cell division cycle 48 (CDC48) belongs to the superfamily protein of ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA). We previously isolated a rice CDC48 mutant (psd128) displaying premature senescence and death phenotype. Here, we showed that OsCDC48 (Os03g0151800) interacted with OsCDC48E (Os10g0442600), a homologue of OsCDC48, to control plant survival in rice. OsCDC48E knockout plants exhibited similar behavior to psd128 with premature senescence and plant death. Removal of the C-terminus of OsCDC48 caused altered expression of cell cycle-related genes, changed the percentage of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, and abolished the interaction between OsCDC48 itself and between OsCDC48 and OsCDC48E, respectively. Furthermore, the truncated OsCDC48-PSD128 protein lacking the C-terminal 27 amino acid residues showed a decreased level of ATPase activity. Overexpression of OsCDC48-psd128 resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, accumulation of reactive oxygen species and decreased plant tiller numbers while overexpression of OsCDC48 also resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, but increased plant tiller numbers and grain yield, indicating its potential utilization for yield improvement. Our results demonstrated that the C-terminal region of OsCDC48 was essential for maintaining the full ATPase activity and OsCDC48/48E complex might function in form of heteromultimers to modulate cellular processes and plant survival in rice.
