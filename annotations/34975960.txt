Land plants evolved to quickly sense and adapt to temperature changes, such as hot days and cold nights. Given that calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling networks are implicated in most abiotic stress responses, heat-triggered changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> were investigated in <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaves and pollen. Plants were engineered with a reporter called CGf, a ratiometric, genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter with an m<b>C</b>herry reference domain fused to an intensiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter <b>G</b>CaMP6<b>f</b>. Relative changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> were estimated based on CGf's apparent <i>K</i> <sub>D</sub> around 220 nM. The ratiometric output provided an opportunity to compare Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics between different tissues, cell types, or subcellular locations. In leaves, CGf detected heat-triggered cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, comprised of three different signatures showing similarly rapid rates of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx followed by differing rates of efflux (50% durations ranging from 5 to 19 min). These heat-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were approximately 1.5-fold greater in magnitude than blue light-triggered signals in the same leaves. In contrast, growing pollen tubes showed two different heat-triggered responses. Exposure to heat caused tip-focused steady growth [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> oscillations to shift to a pattern characteristic of a growth arrest (22%), or an almost undetectable [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> (78%). Together, these contrasting examples of heat-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in leaves and pollen highlight the diversity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in plants, inviting speculations about their differing kinetic features and biological functions.
