The recently identified PPR-E+/NVWA/DYW2 RNA editing complex provides insights into the mechanism of RNA editing in higher plant organelles. However, whether the complex works together with the previously identified editing factors RIPs/MORFs is unclear. In this paper, we identified a maize Smk6 gene, which encodes a mitochondrion-targeted PPR-E+protein with E1 and E2 domains at the C terminus. Loss of Smk6 function affects the C-to-U editing at nad1-740, nad4L-110, nad7-739, and mttB-138,139 sites, impairs mitochondrial activity and blocks embryogenesis and endosperm development. Genetic and molecular analysis indicated that SMK6 is the maize ortholog of the Arabidopsis SLO2, which is a component of the PPR-E+/NVWA/DYW2 editing complex. However, yeast two-hybrid analyses did not detect any interaction between SMK6 and any of the mitochondrion-targeted RIPs/MORFs, suggesting that RIPs/MORFs may not be a component of PPR-E+/NVWA/DYW2 RNA editing complex. Further analyses are required to provide evidence that RIP/MORFs and SMK6 do not physically interact in vivo.
