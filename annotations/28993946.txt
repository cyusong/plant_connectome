Tobacco EXPA4 plays a role in Nicotiana benthamiana defence against virus attack and affects antioxidative metabolism and phytohormone-mediated immunity responses in tobacco. Expansins are cell wall-loosening proteins known for their endogenous functions in cell wall extensibility during plant growth. The effects of expansins on plant growth, developmental processes and environment stress responses have been well studied. However, the exploration of expansins in plant virus resistance is rarely reported. In the present study, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and Agrobacterium-mediated transient overexpression were conducted to investigate the role of Nicotiana tabacum alpha-expansin 4 (EXPA4) in modulating Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV-GFP) resistance in Nicotiana benthamiana. The results indicated that silencing of EXPA4 reduced the sensitivity of N. benthamiana to TMV-GFP, and EXPA4 overexpression accelerated virus reproduction on tobacco. In addition, our data suggested that the changes of virus accumulation in response to EXPA4 expression levels could further affect the antioxidative metabolism and phytohormone-related pathways in tobacco induced by virus inoculation. EXPA4-silenced plants with TMV-GFP have enhanced antioxidant enzymes activities, which were down-regulated in virus-inoculated 35S:EXPA4 plants. Salicylic acid accumulation and SA-mediated defence genes induced by TMV-GFP were up-regulated in EXPA4-silenced plants, but depressed in 35S:EXPA4 plants. Furthermore, a VIGS approach was used in combination with exogenous phytohormone treatments, suggesting that EXPA4 has different responses to different phytohormones. Taken together, these results suggested that EXPA4 plays a role in tobacco defence against viral pathogens.
