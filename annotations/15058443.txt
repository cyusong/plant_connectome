['15058443', 'In seed plants, the ovule is the female reproductive structure, which surrounds  and nourishes the gametophyte and embryo. This investigation describes the PRETTY  FEW SEEDS2 (PFS2) locus, which regulates ovule patterning. The pfs2 mutant  exhibited developmental defects in the maternal integuments and gametophyte. This  mutation was inherited as a maternal trait, indicating that gametophyte defects  resulted from ovule patterning aberrations. Specifically, the boundary between  the chalaza and the nucellus, two regions of the ovule primordia, shifted towards  the distal end of pfs2 ovule primordia. Results indicated that the PFS2 locus  could: (i) be involved in the development of either the nucellus or the chalaza;  or (ii) establish a boundary between these two regions. Examination of genetic  interactions of the pfs2 mutation with other well-characterized ovule loci  indicates that this locus affects integument morphogenesis. Interestingly, the  pfs2 inner no outer and pfs2 strubbelig double mutants had inner integuments that  appeared similar to their ancestral precursor. The fossil record indicates that  the inner integument evolved by fusion of sterilized sporangia or branches around  a central megasporangium. The question of whether the structures observed in  these double mutants are homologous or merely analogous to the ancestral  precursors of the inner integument is discussed.', '2004 Feb 7', 'Proc Biol Sci', '10.1098/rspb.2003.2544', 'Hauser']
