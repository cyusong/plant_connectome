['31601035', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana broad-range sugar phosphate phosphatase AtSgpp  (NP_565895.1, locus AT2G38740) and the specific DL-glycerol-3-phosphatase AtGpp  (NP_568858.1, locus AT5G57440) are members of the wide family of  magnesium-dependent acid phosphatases subfamily I with the C1-type cap domain  haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase proteins (HAD). Although both AtSgpp and  AtGpp have a superimporsable alpha/beta Rossmann core active site, they differ with  respect to the loop-5 of the cap domain, accounting for the differences in  substrate specificity. Recent functional studies have demonstrated the essential  but not sufficient role of the signature sequence within the motif-5 in substrate  discrimination. To better understand the mechanism underlying the control of  specificity, we explored additional sequence determinants underpinning the  divergent evolutionary selection exerted on the substrate affinity of both  enzymes. The most evident difference was found in the loop preceding the loop-5  of the cap domain, which is extended in three additional residues in AtSgpp. To  determine if the shortening of this loop would constrain the substrate ambiguity  of AtSgpp, we deleted these three aminoacids. The kinetic analyses of the  resulting mutant protein AtSgpp3Delta (DeltaF53, DeltaN54, DeltaN55) indicate that promiscuity is  compromised. AtSgpp3Delta displays highest level of discrimination for  D-ribose-5-phosphate compared to the rest of phosphate ester metabolites tested,  which may suggest a proper orientation of D-ribose-5-phosphate in the AtSgpp3Delta  active site.', '2019 Oct 9', 'Biology (Basel)', '10.3390/biology8040077', 'Culianez-Macia']
