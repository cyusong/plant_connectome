Fruits are reproductive organs in flowering plants and the harvested products of many agricultural crops. They play an increasingly important role in the human diet due to their nutritional values. Water is the most abundant component of most fleshy fruits, and it is essential for fruit growth and quality formation. Water is transported to the fruit via the vascular system (xylem and phloem) and lost to the air through the fruit surface due to transpiration. This minireview presents a framework for understanding water transport in fleshy fruits along with brief introductions of key methodologies used in this research field. We summarize the advances in the research on the patterns of water flow into and out of the fruit over development and under different environmental conditions and cultural practices. We review the key findings on fruit transpiration, xylem transport, phloem transport, and the coordination of water flows in maintaining fruit water balance. We also summarize research on post-vascular water transport mediated by aquaporins in fruits. More efforts are needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which different environmental conditions impact fruit water transport at the micro-level and to better understand the physiological implications of the coordination of water flows. Incorporating fruit water transport into the research area of plant hydraulics will provide new insights into water transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum.
