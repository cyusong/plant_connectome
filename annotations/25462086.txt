Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient that limits agricultural productivity, and both low and high N supply have been suggested to alter plant growth. The overall aim of this work is to study the impact of nitrate (NO3(-)) in maize yield and the possible causes that induce this alteration. High NO3(-) doses did not increase the yield of maize grown neither in the field nor under controlled conditions. In fact, plants grown under controlled conditions for 45 days with NO3(-) concentrations over 5mM showed a decrease in biomass production. This reduction was perceptible in shoots prior to roots, where phytomer expansion was reduced. Cell size and number were also reduced in the leaves of plants with high NO3(-). This alteration was correlated with the increase of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid in leaves, which was probably translocated from the roots in order to synthesize ethylene. Cytokinins (CKs) also showed a relevant role in this inhibitory effect, increasing in high NO3(-) plants with a reduction in root and shoot growth, inhibition of apical dominance and a strong decrease of leaf expansion, symptoms described previously as "CK syndrome". We propose that high NO3(-) inhibits maize growth by causing hormonal alterations that modify plant growth from cell to whole plant.

CKs: !increase! in high NO3(-) plants
CKs: !inhibit! root and shoot growth
CKs: !inhibit! apical dominance
CKs: !decrease! leaf expansion
