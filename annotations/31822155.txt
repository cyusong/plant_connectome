Most primary auxin response genes are classified into three families, namely <i>AUX/IAAs, GH3</i>s, and <i>SAURs</i>. As a rapidly developing field of plant biology, recent studies have begun to address the function and mechanism of plant <i>SAURs</i>. We found that, in Arabidopsis, the <i>SAUR41</i> subfamily genes were ABA-inducible, and overexpression of <i>SAUR41</i> induced the biosynthesis of ABA. The <i>saur41/40/71/72</i> quadruple mutants and the <i>SAUR41</i> overexpression lines had an altered expression of ABA and calcium homeostasis/signaling genes, but not the <i>AUX/IAAs</i> and <i>GH3s</i>. Here, we reported that the quadruple mutants showed an increased sensitivity to ABA treatment, in terms of cotyledon greening/expansion rate, while for the overexpression lines, this was decreased. With respect to the root touch response, the overexpression of <i>SAUR41</i> led to an extensive root looping phenotype, while the quadruple mutations of <i>saur41s</i> led to a relaxed root looping. As reported, the ion content (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>), apoplast acidification ability, and salt tolerance were also abnormal in the quadruple mutants and/or the <i>SAUR41</i> overexpression lines. Our work supports an emerging concept that ABA and calcium are integrated together to modulate ion homeostasis. In addition, our work demonstrates that SAUR41s might be new components for the regulation of ion homeostasis by ABA and calcium.
