Aquaporins (AQPs) are ubiquitous in nearly all organisms, mediating selective and rapid flux of water across biological membranes. The role of AQPs in phytopathogenic fungi is poorly understood. Orthologs of AQP genes in Botrytis cinerea were identified and knocked out. The effects of AQPs on hyphal growth and conidiation, formation of infection structures and virulence on plant hosts were examined. The role of AQP8 in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, distribution and transport were further determined. Among eight AQPs, only AQP8 was essential for the ability of B. cinerea to infect plants. AQP8 was demonstrated to be an intrinsic plasma membrane protein, which may function as a channel and mediate hydrogen peroxide uptake. Deletion of AQP8 in B. cinerea completely inhibited the development of conidia and infection structures, and significantly affected noxR expression. Further observations revealed that both AQP8 and noxR impacted ROS distribution in the hyphal tips of B. cinerea. Moreover, AQP8 affected the expression of a mitochondrial protein, NQO1. A knockout mutant of NQO1 was observed to display reduced virulence. These data lead to a better understanding of the important role of AQP8 in the development and pathogenesis of plant pathogens.
