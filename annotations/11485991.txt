['11485991', 'The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays a wide range of important roles in  plant growth and development, including embryogenesis, seed dormancy, root and  shoot growth, transpiration, and stress tolerance. ABA and various abiotic  stresses also activate the expression of numerous plant genes through undefined  signaling pathways. To gain insight into ABA and stress signal transduction, we  conducted a genetic screen based on ABA- and stress-inducible gene transcription.  Here we report the identification of an Arabidopsis mutation, fiery1 (fry1),  which results in super-induction of ABA- and stress-responsive genes. Seed  germination and postembryonic development of fry1 are more sensitive to ABA or  stress inhibition. The mutant plants are also compromised in tolerance to  freezing, drought, and salt stresses. Map-based cloning revealed that FRY1  encodes an inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, which functions in the  catabolism of inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP(3)). Upon ABA treatment, fry1  mutant plants accumulated more IP(3) than did the wild-type plants. These results  provide the first genetic evidence indicating that phosphoinositols mediate ABA  and stress signal transduction in plants and their turnover is critical for  attenuating ABA and stress signaling.', '2001 Aug 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.891901', 'Zhu']
