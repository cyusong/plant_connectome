Bacterial wilt, a disease impacting cultivated crops worldwide, is caused by the pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum. PopP2 (for Pseudomonas outer protein P2) is an R. solanacearum type III effector that belongs to the YopJ/AvrRxv protein family and interacts with the Arabidopsis thaliana RESISTANT TO RALSTONIA SOLANACEARUM 1-R (RRS1-R) resistance protein. RRS1-R contains the Toll/Interleukin1 receptor-nucleotide binding site-Leu-rich repeat domains found in several cytoplasmic R proteins and a C-terminal WRKY DNA binding domain. In this study, we identified the Arabidopsis Cys protease RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION19 (RD19) as being a PopP2-interacting protein whose expression is induced during infection by R. solanacearum. An Arabidopsis rd19 mutant in an RRS1-R genetic background is compromised in resistance to the bacterium, indicating that RD19 is required for RRS1-R-mediated resistance. RD19 normally localizes in mobile vacuole-associated compartments and, upon coexpression with PopP2, is specifically relocalized to the plant nucleus, where the two proteins physically interact. No direct physical interaction between RRS1-R and RD19 in the presence of PopP2 was detected in the nucleus as determined by Förster resonance energy transfer. We propose that RD19 associates with PopP2 to form a nuclear complex that is required for activation of the RRS1-R-mediated resistance response.
