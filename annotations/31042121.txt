Virus-induced silencing gene technology has been increasingly used; however, a controversy exists among researchers about whether using the sense or antisense orientation of the gene target is more efficient. Herein, instead of using the entire citrus tree, a reduced system consisting of a single leaf, 5 cm of the stem and a few roots was established to fairly compare between the sense or antisense orientation of phytoene desaturase gene (<i>pds</i>) in the <i>Citrus tristeza virus</i> vector, for improved RNAi efficiency. Although the virus titers were similar in the two cases, the gene expression of <i>pds</i> was significantly lower when using the antisense orientation than using the sense orientation. I hypothesize that the extra effect from use of antisense orientation is due to the role of subgenomic RNA as a supplemental source for complementary sequences, thus resulting in more RNAi.
