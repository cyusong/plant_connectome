Moderately warm constant ambient temperatures tend to oppose light signals in the control of plant architecture. By contrast, here we show that brief heat shocks enhance the inhibition of hypocotyl growth induced by light perceived by phytochrome B in deetiolating Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. In darkness, daily heat shocks transiently increased the expression of pseudo-response regulator7 (PRR7) and PRR9 and markedly enhanced the amplitude of the rhythms of late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) and circadian clock associated1 (CCA1) expression. In turn, these rhythms gated the hypocotyl response to red light, in part by changing the expression of phytochrome interacting FACTOR4 (PIF4) and PIF5. After light exposure, heat shocks also reduced the nuclear abundance of constitutive photomorphogenic1 (COP1) and increased the abundance of its target elongated hypocotyl5 (HY5). The synergism between light and heat shocks was deficient in the prr7 prr9, lhy cca1, pif4 pif5, cop1, and hy5 mutants. The evening element (binding site of LHY and CCA1) and G-box promoter motifs (binding site of PIFs and HY5) were overrepresented among genes with expression controlled by both heat shock and red light. The heat shocks experienced by buried seedlings approaching the surface of the soil prepare the seedlings for the impending exposure to light by rhythmically lowering LHY, CCA1, PIF4, and PIF5 expression and by enhancing HY5 stability.
