Protein degradation by the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system is a critical process that modulates many eukaryotic cellular processes. E3 ligase usually modulates stress response by adjusting the stability of transcription factors. Previous studies have shown that a RING-type E3 ligase, CaASRF1, positively modulates abscisic acid (ABA) signalling and ABA-mediated drought response by modulating the stability of CaAIBZ1 and CaATBZ1. In this study, we conducted yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening with CaATBZ1 to isolate an additional modulator, identified as CaATIR1 (Capsicum annuum ATBZ1 Interacting RING finger protein 1). CaATIR1 has E3 ligase activity and promoted CaATBZ1 degradation using the 26S proteasome system. We investigated the loss-of and gain-of functions of this E3 ligase by using silencing pepper and overexpressing (OX) Arabidopsis plants, respectively. In response to ABA and drought treatments, CaATIR1-silenced pepper plants showed ABA insensitive and drought-sensitive phenotypes, while CaATIR1-OX plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, CaATBZ1-silencing rescued the ABA insensitive and drought-sensitive phenotypes of CaATIR1-silencing pepper plants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the stability of CaATBZ1 mediated by CaATIR1 has a crucial role in drought stress signalling in pepper plants.
