Manganese (Mn) is pivotal for plant growth and development but little is known about the processes that control its homeostasis in the cell. A spotlight on the pools of intracellular manganese and their cellular function has recently been gained through the characterization of new Mn transporters. In particular, transporters catalyzing the ins and outs of Mn at the various Golgi membranes have revealed the central role of the Golgi pool of Mn in the synthesis of the cell wall and as a reservoir for the numerous cellular Mn-dependent pathways whose calibration relies on a set of Golgi-resident transporters of the BICAT and NRAMP families.
