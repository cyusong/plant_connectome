['32788299', 'Root development is important for normal plant growth and nutrient absorption.  Studies have revealed the involvement of various factors in this complex process,  improving our understanding of the relevant regulatory mechanisms. Here, we  functionally characterize the role of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase gamma2 (PI4Kgamma2) in root elongation regulation, which  functions to modulate stability of the RING-type E3 ligase MYB30-INTERACTING E3  LIGASE1 (MIEL1) and auxin metabolism. Mutant plants deficient in PI4Kgamma2 (pi4kgamma2)  exhibited a shortened root length and elongation zone due to reduced auxin level.  PI4Kgamma2 was shown to interact with MIEL1, regulating its degradation and  furthering the stability of transcription factor MYB30 (which suppresses auxin  metabolism by directly binding to promoter regions of GH3 2 and GH3 6).  Interestingly, pi4kgamma2 plants presented altered hypersensitive response,  indicating that PI4Kgamma2 regulates synergetic growth and defense of plants through  modulating auxin metabolism. These results reveal the importance of protein  interaction in regulating ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in eukaryotic  cells, and illustrate a mechanism coordinating plant growth and biotic stress  response.', '2020 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.20.00799', 'ORCID:']
