The 14-3-3 phospho-binding proteins with scaffolding activity play central roles in the regulation of enzymes and signaling complexes in eukaryotes. In plants, 14-3-3 isoforms are required for disease resistance and key targets of pathogen effectors. Here, we examined the requirement of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) 14-3-3 isoform (TFT) protein family for Xv3 disease resistance in response to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas euvesicatoria. In addition, we determined whether TFT proteins interact with the repertoire of X. euvesicatoria type III secretion effector proteins, including AvrXv3, the elicitor of Xv3 resistance. We show that multiple TFT contribute to Xv3 resistance. We also show that one or more TFT proteins physically interact with multiple effectors (AvrXv3, XopE1, XopE2, XopN, XopO, XopQ, and XopAU). Genetic analyses indicate that none of the identified effectors interfere with AvrXv3-elicited resistance into Xv3 tomato leaves; however, XopE1, XopE2, and XopO are required to suppress symptom development in susceptible tomato leaves. Phospho-peptide mapping revealed that XopE2 is phosphorylated at multiple residues in planta and residues T66, T131, and S334 are required for maximal binding to TFT10. Together, our data support the hypothesis that multiple TFT proteins are involved in immune signaling during X. euvesicatoria infection.
