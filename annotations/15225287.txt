['15225287', "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are membrane proteins responsible for  cellular detoxification processes in plants and animals. Recent evidence shows  that this class of transporters may also be involved in many other cellular  processes. Because of their homology with human multidrug resistance-associated  proteins (MRP), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and  sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), some plant ABC transporters have been implicated in  the regulation of ion channel activities. This paper describes an investigation  of the AtMRP4 gene and its role in stomatal regulation. Reporter gene studies  showed that AtMRP4 is highly expressed in stomata and that the protein is  localized to the plasma membrane. Stomatal aperture in three independent atmrp4  mutant alleles was larger than in wild-type plants, both in the light and in the  dark, resulting in increased water loss but no change in the photosynthetic rate.  In baker's yeast, AtMRP4 shows ATP-dependent, vanadate-sensitive transport of  methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate and a substrate of mammalian MRPs. Treatment  with MTX reduced stomatal opening in wild-type plants, but had no effect in  atmrp4 mutants. These results indicate the involvement of AtMRP4 in the complex  regulation of stomatal aperture.", '2004 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02125.x', 'Martinoia']
