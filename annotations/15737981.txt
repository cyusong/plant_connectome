['15737981', 'The Arabidopsis frill1 (frl1) mutant, that has serrated petals and sepals but no  other large changes in plant morphology, was studied. The frl1 had a mutation in  STEROL METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 and an altered sterol composition. It was found that  the frl1 mutation causes ectopic endoreduplication in petal tips that do not  normally endoreduplicate. The rosette leaves of frl1 also showed an enhanced  level of endoreduplication, but their morphology was hardly affected. These facts  suggest that the suppression of endoreduplication is important for petal  morphogenesis and the normal sterol composition is required for this suppression.', '2005 Apr', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eri122', 'Tanaka']
