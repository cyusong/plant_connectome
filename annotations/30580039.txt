The composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in triacylglycerols (TAGs) is key to health benefits and for oil applications, yet the underlying genetic mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, by in silico, ex vivo, and in vivo profiling of type-2 diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT2s) in Nannochloropsis oceanica we revealed two novel PUFA-preferring enzymes that discriminate individual PUFA species in TAG assembly, with NoDGAT2J for linoleic acid (LA) and NoDGAT2K for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The LA and EPA composition of TAG molecules is mediated in vivo via the functional partitioning between NoDGAT2J and 2K, both of which are localized in the chloroplast envelope. By modulating transcript abundance of the DGAT2s, an N. oceanica strain bank was created, where proportions of LA and EPA in TAG vary by 18.7-fold (between 0.21% and 3.92% dry weight) and 34.7-fold (between 0.09% and 3.12% dry weight), respectively. These findings lay the foundation for producing designer TAG molecules with tailored health benefits or for biofuel applications in industrial microalgae and higher-plant crops.
