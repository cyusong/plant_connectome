<i>Phytophthora capsici</i> is an important plant pathogenic oomycete with multiple hosts. The P4-ATPases, aminophospholipid translocases (APTs), play essential roles in the growth and pathogenesis of fungal pathogens. However, the function of P4-ATPase in <i>P. capsici</i> remains unclear. This study identified and characterized PcApt1, a P4-ATPase Drs2 homolog, in <i>P. capsici.</i> Deletion of <i>PcAPT1</i> by CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out strategy impaired hyphal growth, extracellular laccase activity. Cytological analyses have shown that PcApt1 participates in phosphatidylserine (PS) transport across the plasma membrane. Also, we showed that targeted deletion of <i>PcAPT1</i> triggered a significant reduction in the virulence of <i>P. capsici</i>. Secretome analyses have demonstrated that secretion of hydrolytic enzymes decreased considerably in the <i>PcAPT1</i> gene deletion strains compared to the wild-type. Overall, our results showed that PcApt1 plays a pivotal role in promoting morphological development, phospholipid transport, secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, and the pathogenicity of the polycyclic phytopathogenic oomycete <i>P. capsici</i>. This study underscores the need for comprehensive evaluation of subsequent members of the P-type ATPase family to provide enhanced insights into the dynamic contributions to the pathogenesis of <i>P. capsici</i> and their possible deployment in the formulation of effective control strategies.
