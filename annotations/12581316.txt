['12581316', 'In plants, low fluences of ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280-320 nm) trigger the  activation of protection mechanisms and various photomorphogenic responses. We  established a novel screen to isolate Arabidopsis T-DNA mutants (uli, UV-B light  insensitive) with reduced sensitivity towards UV-B light-mediated inhibition of  hypocotyl growth. One of the mutants, uli3, shows also a reduced sensitivity of  UV-B-induced gene expression events and was, therefore, chosen for further  investigation. The ULI3 gene encodes an 80-kDa protein with potential domains for  heme- and diacylglycerol-binding. In transiently transfected protoplasts, the  ULI3:GFP fusion protein is localised in the cytoplasm but also adjacent to  membranes. In etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings irradiated by UV-B, ULI3 mRNA  expression is strongly up-regulated. This is caused by elevated transcription as  demonstrated using stable transformants where a GUS-reporter was driven by the  ULI3-promoter. ULI3 is preferentially expressed in the outer cell layers in  leaves, stems and flowers, but not in roots. There is evidence that ULI3  represents a specific component involved in UV-B-mediated signal transduction in  higher plants.', '2003 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01649.x', 'Frohnmeyer']
