['18835170', "Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a global problem severely limiting agricultural  productivity in acid-soil regions comprising upwards of 50% of the world's arable  land [1, 2]. Although Al-exclusion mechanisms have been intensively studied  [3-9], little is known about tolerance to internalized Al, which is predicted to  be mechanistically complex because of the plethora of predicted cellular targets  for Al(3+)[2, 10]. An Arabidopsis mutant with Al hypersensitivity, als3-1, was  found to represent a lesion in a phloem and root-tip-localized factor similar to  the bacterial ABC transporter ybbm, with ALS3 likely responsible for Al transfer  from roots to less-sensitive tissues [10-12]. To identify mutations that enhance  mechanisms of Al resistance or tolerance, a suppressor screen for mutants that  mask the Al hypersensitivity of als3-1 was performed [13]. Two allelic  suppressors conferring increased Al tolerance were found to represent  dominant-negative mutations in a factor required for monitoring DNA integrity,  AtATR[14-17]. From this work, Al-dependent root-growth inhibition primarily  arises from DNA damage coupled with AtATR-controlled blockage of cell-cycle  progression and terminal differentiation because of loss of the root-quiescent  center, with mutations that prevent response to this damage resulting in  quiescent-center maintenance and sustained vigorous growth in an Al-toxic  environment.", '2008 Oct 14', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2008.08.050', 'Larsen']
