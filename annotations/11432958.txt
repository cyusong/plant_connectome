['11432958', 'The SUC1/CKS1 proteins interact with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and play an  essential, but yet not entirely resolved, role in the regulation of the cell  cycle. With the Arabidopsis thaliana CKS1At protein as bait in a two-hybrid  screen, two novel Arabidopsis CDKs, Arath;CDKB1;2 and Arath;CDKB2;1, were  isolated. A closely related homologue of Arath;CDKB2;1 was discovered in the  databases and was nominated Arath;CDKB2;2. Transcript analysis of the five known  Arath;CDKA and Arath;CDKB genes revealed that they all had the highest expression  in flowers and cell suspensions. Differences in the expression patterns in roots,  leaves and stems suggest unique roles for each CDK.', '2001 Jun', 'J Exp Bot', None, 'De']
