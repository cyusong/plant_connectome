['11161061', 'By screening for enhanced ethylene-response (eer) mutants in Arabidopsis, we  isolated a novel recessive mutant, eer1, which displays increased ethylene  sensitivity in the hypocotyl and stem. Dark-grown eer1 seedlings have short and  thick hypocotyls even in the absence of added ethylene. This phenotype is  suppressed, however, by the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor  1-aminoethoxyvinyl-glycine. Following ethylene treatment, the dark-grown eer1  hypocotyl response is greatly exaggerated in comparison with the wild type,  indicating that the eer1 phenotype is not simply due to ethylene overproduction.  eer1 seedlings have significantly elevated levels of basic-chitinase expression,  suggesting that eer1 may be highly sensitive to low levels of endogenous  ethylene. Adult eer1 plants display exaggerated ethylene-dependent stem  thickening, which is an ethylene response previously unreported in Arabidopsis.  eer1 also has enhanced responsiveness to the ethylene agonists propylene and  2,5-norbornadiene. The eer1 phenotype is completely suppressed by the  ethylene-insensitive mutation etr1-1, and is additive with the constitutive  ethylene-response mutation ctr1-3. Our findings suggest that the wild-type EER1  product acts to oppose ethylene responses in the hypocotyl and stem.', '2001 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.125.2.1061', 'Chang']
