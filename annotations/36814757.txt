Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), one of the main viruses, is responsible for <i>Passiflora</i> spp. (passion fruit) virus diseases, which negatively affect its planting, cultivation, and commercial quality. In this study, a laboratory anti-CMV activity screening model for <i>Passiflora</i> spp. CMV disease was first established. Then, the effects of different antiviral agents of chitosan oligosaccharide (COS), dufulin (DFL), and ningnanmycin (Ning) on CMV virulence rate in <i>Passiflora</i> spp. were determined. The virulence rate and anti-CMV activity in <i>Passiflora</i> spp. treated with COS were 50% and 45.48%, respectively, which were even better than those of DFL (66.67% and 27.30%, respectively) and Ning (83.30% and 9.17%, respectively). Field trials test results showed COS revealed better average control efficiency (47.35%) against <i>Passiflora</i> spp. CMV disease than those of DFL (40.93%) and Ning (33.82%), indicating that COS is effective in the control of the <i>Passiflora</i> spp. CMV disease. Meanwhile, the nutritional quality test results showed that COS could increase the contents of soluble solids, titratable acids, vitamin C, and soluble proteins in <i>Passiflora</i> spp. fruits as well as enhance the polyphenol oxidase (PPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD) activity in the leaves of <i>Passiflora</i> spp. seedlings. In addition, the combined transcriptome and proteome analysis results showed that COS mainly acted on the Brassinosteroids (BRs) cell signaling pathway, one of plant hormone signal transduction pathway, in <i>Passiflora</i> spp., thus activating the up-regulated expression of <i>TCH4</i> and <i>CYCD3</i> genes to improve the resistance to CMV disease. Therefore, our study results demonstrated that COS could be used as a potential plant immune inducer to control the <i>Passiflora</i> spp. CMV disease in the future.
