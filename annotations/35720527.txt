The spotted wing Drosophila (SWD), <i>Drosophila suzukii</i>, is a significant invasive pest of berries and soft-skinned fruits that causes major economic losses in fruit production worldwide. Automatic identification and monitoring strategies would allow to detect the emergence of this pest in an early stage and minimize its impact. The small size of <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> and similar flying insects makes it difficult to identify them using camera systems. Therefore, an optical sensor recording wingbeats was investigated in this study. We trained convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers to distinguish <i>D. suzukii</i> insects from one of their closest relatives, <i>Drosophila Melanogaster</i>, based on their wingbeat patterns recorded by the optical sensor. Apart from the original wingbeat time signals, we modeled their frequency (power spectral density) and time-frequency (spectrogram) representations. A strict validation procedure was followed to estimate the models' performance in field-conditions. First, we validated each model on wingbeat data that was collected under the same conditions using different insect populations to train and test them. Next, we evaluated their robustness on a second independent dataset which was acquired under more variable environmental conditions. The best performing model, named "InceptionFly," was trained on wingbeat time signals. It was able to discriminate between our two target insects with a balanced accuracy of 92.1% on the test set and 91.7% on the second independent dataset. This paves the way towards early, automated detection of <i>D. suzukii</i> infestation in fruit orchards.
