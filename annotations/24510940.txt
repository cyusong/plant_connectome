Nickel is an economically important metal and phytotechnologies are being developed to limit the impact of nickel mining on the environment. More than 300 plant species are known to hyperaccumulate nickel. However, our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in nickel accumulation in plants is very limited because it has not yet been possible to study these hyperaccumulators at the genomic level. Here, we used next-generation sequencing technologies to sequence the transcriptome of the nickel hyperaccumulator Psychotria gabriellae of the Rubiaceae family, and used yeast and Arabidopsis as heterologous systems to study the activity of identified metal transporters. We characterized the activity of three metal transporters from the NRAMP and IREG/FPN families. In particular, we showed that PgIREG1 is able to confer nickel tolerance when expressed in yeast and in transgenic plants, where it localizes in the tonoplast. In addition, PgIREG1 shows higher expression in P. gabriellae than in the related non-accumulator species Psychotria semperflorens. Our results designate PgIREG1 as a candidate gene for nickel tolerance and hyperaccumulation in P. gabriellae. These results also show how next-generation sequencing technologies can be used to access the transcriptome of non-model nickel hyperaccumulators to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms.
