Root growth and development has become an important research topic for breeders and researchers based on a growing need to adapt plants to changing and more demanding environmental conditions worldwide. Over the last few years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) became an important tool to identify the link between traits in the field and their genetic background. Here we give an overview of the current literature concerning GWASs performed on root system architecture (RSA) in plants. We summarize which root traits and approaches have been used for GWAS, mentioning their respective success rate towards a successful gene discovery. Furthermore, we zoom in on the current technical hurdles in root phenotyping and GWAS, and discuss future possibilities in this field of research.
