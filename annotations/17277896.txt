['17277896', 'Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) is an endogenous auxin that acts in Arabidopsis  primarily via its conversion to the principal auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).  Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that this conversion is similar to  peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation, but the specific enzymes catalyzing IBA  beta-oxidation have not been identified. We identified an IBA-response mutant  (ibr3) with decreased responses to the inhibitory effects of IBA on root  elongation or the stimulatory effects of IBA on lateral root formation. However,  ibr3 mutants respond normally to other forms of auxin, including IAA. The mutant  seedlings germinate and develop normally, even in the absence of sucrose,  suggesting that fatty acid beta-oxidation is unaffected. Additionally, double  mutants between ibr3 and acx3, which is defective in an acyl-CoA oxidase acting  in fatty acid beta-oxidation, have enhanced IBA resistance, consistent with a  distinct role for IBR3. Positional cloning revealed that IBR3 encodes a putative  acyl-CoA dehydrogenase with a consensus peroxisomal targeting signal. Based on  the singular defect of this mutant in responding to IBA, we propose that IBR3 may  act directly in the oxidation of IBA to IAA.', '2007 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-007-9134-2', 'Bartel']
