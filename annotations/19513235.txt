['19513235', 'The Arabidopsis genome encodes a 20-member gene family of mitogen-activated  protein kinases (MPKs) but biological roles have only been identified for a small  subset of these crucial signalling components. In particular, it is unclear how  the MPKs may be organized into functional modules within the cell. To gain  insight into their potential relationships, we used the yeast two-hybrid system  to conduct a directed protein-protein interaction screen between all the  Arabidopsis MPKs and their upstream activators (MAPK kinases; MKK). Novel  interactions were also tested in vitro for enzyme-substrate functionality, using  recombinant proteins. The resulting data confirm a number of earlier reported  MKK-MPK relationships, but also reveal a more extensive pattern of interactions  that should help to guide future analyses of MAPK signalling in plants.', '2008 Dec', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.3.12.6848', 'Ellis']
