Root hairs represent a beneficial agronomic trait to potentially reduce fertilizer and irrigation inputs. Over the past decades, research in the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana has provided insights into root hair development, the underlying genetic framework and the integration of environmental cues within this framework. Recent years have seen a paradigm shift, where studies are now highlighting conservation and diversification of root hair developmental programs in other plant species and the agronomic relevance of root hairs in a wider ecological context. In this review, we specifically discuss the molecular evolution of the RSL (RHD Six-Like) pathway that controls root hair development and growth in land plants. We also discuss how root hairs contribute to plant performance as an active physiological rooting structure by performing resource acquisition, providing anchorage and constructing the rhizosphere with desirable physical, chemical and biological properties. Finally, we outline future research directions that can help achieve the potential of root hairs in developing sustainable agroecosystems.
