GATA transcription factors (TFs) are type IV zinc-finger proteins that have roles in plant development and growth. The 27 GATA TFs identified in the <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> genome in this study were unevenly distributed across all five chromosomes and classified into four subgroups. Phylogenesis-related GATAs shared similar gene structures and conserved motifs. Expression profiles showed that all <i>BdGATA</i> genes were expressed in leaves and most were induced by PEG treatment. <i>BdGATA13</i> was predominantly expressed in leaf tissue and phylogenetically close to <i>OsSNFL1</i>, <i>AtGNC</i>, and <i>AtGNL</i>. Its protein was detected in the nucleus by subcellular localization analysis. Overexpression of <i>BdGATA13</i> in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> resulted in darker green leaves, later flowering, and more importantly, enhanced drought tolerance compared to the wild type. <i>BdGATA13</i> also promoted primary root development under GA treatment. These results lay a foundation for better understanding the function of <i>GATA</i> genes in <i>B. distachyon</i> and other plants.
