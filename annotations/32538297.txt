The C4 plants like maize are at an advantage because they exhibit higher carbon conversion efficiency than C3 during photosynthesis. Using the evaluation of photosynthetic phenotypes and subcellular structure, and high-quality transcriptome analysis for four types of leaves from a bundle sheath defective maize mutant (<i>bsd</i>) and 501 wild line, the key target genes, important transcription factors, and specific pathways were obtained, which may regulate the C-concentrating mechanisms and antioxidant protection of the photosynthetic system, gibberellin signaling, ribosome editing, glycolysis, and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Based on these target genes, a novel network with photosynthetic transformation efficiency with oxidative decarboxylation and ribosome regulation was filtered innovatively by Cytoscape, which adds to our understanding for high-efficiency C-fixation and its genetic improvement in C3 and C4 plants.
