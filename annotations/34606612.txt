Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a versatile and attractive approach for functional gene characterization in plants. Although several VIGS vectors for maize (Zea mays) have been previously developed, their utilities are limited due to low viral infection efficiency, insert instability, short maintenance of silencing, inadequate inoculation method, or abnormal requirement of growth temperature. Here, we established a Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-based VIGS system for efficient maize gene silencing that overcomes many limitations of VIGS currently available for maize. Using two distinct strains, CMV-ZMBJ and CMV-Fny, we generated a pseudorecombinant-chimeric (Pr) CMV. Pr CMV showed high infection efficacy but mild viral symptoms in maize. We then constructed Pr CMV-based vectors for VIGS, dubbed Pr CMV VIGS. Pr CMV VIGS is simply performed by mechanical inoculation of young maize leaves with saps of Pr CMV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana under normal growth conditions. Indeed, suppression of isopentenyl/dimethylallyl diphosphate synthase (ZmIspH) expression by Pr CMV VIGS resulted in non-inoculated leaf bleaching as early as 5 d post-inoculation (dpi) and exhibited constant and efficient systemic silencing over the whole maize growth period up to 105 dpi. Furthermore, utilizing a ligation-independent cloning (LIC) strategy, we developed a modified Pr CMV-LIC VIGS vector, allowing easy gene cloning for high-throughput silencing in maize. Thus, our Pr CMV VIGS system provides a much-improved toolbox to facilitate efficient and long-duration gene silencing for large-scale functional genomics in maize, and our pseudorecombination-chimera combination strategy provides an approach to construct efficient VIGS systems in plants.
