Agronomic inputs and technologies, especially fertilizers, act on the evolution of the symbiotic partnership between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and cultivated plants. The use of the MycoPatt method for the assessment of mycorrhizas in maize roots leads to the extraction of large parameter databases with an increased resolution over the colonization mechanism. The application of a biostimulator treatment on plants acted toward a reduction of root permissiveness for mycorrhizas. The phenomenon was noticeable through an increased colonization variability that overlapped with plant nutritional needs. The annual characteristic of the plant was highlighted by the simultaneous presence of arbuscules and vesicles, with a high share of arbuscules in the advanced phenophases. Colonized root parts presented numerous arbuscule-dominated areas in all phenophases, which indicated a continuous formation of these structures and an intense nutrient transfer between partners. Mycorrhizal maps showed the slowing effect of the biostimulators on colonization, with one phenophase delay in the case of biostimulated plants compared to the ones without biostimulators. The forecast models presented gradual colonization in plants without biostimulators, with the expansion of new hyphal networks. The use of biostimulators on plants exhibited a lower permissiveness for new colonization areas, and the mechanism relies on hyphae developed in the former phenophases.
