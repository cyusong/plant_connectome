['20033437', 'We isolated lap3-1 and lap3-2 mutants in a screen for pollen that displays  abnormal stigma binding. Unlike wild-type pollen, lap3-1 and lap3-2 pollen exine  is thinner, weaker, and is missing some connections between their roof-like  tectum structures. We describe the mapping and identification of LAP3 as a novel  gene that contains a repetitive motif found in beta-propeller enzymes. Insertion  mutations in LAP3 lead to male sterility. To investigate possible roles for LAP3  in pollen development, we assayed the metabolite profile of anther tissues  containing developing pollen grains and found that the lap3-2 defect leads to a  broad range of metabolic changes. The largest changes were seen in levels of a  straight-chain hydrocarbon nonacosane and in naringenin chalcone, an obligate  compound in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway.', '2009 Sep', 'Sex Plant Reprod', '10.1007/s00497-009-0101-8', 'Swanson']
