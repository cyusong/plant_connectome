The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gynoecium, the female floral reproductive structure, requires the action of genes that specify positional identities during its development to generate an organ competent for seed development and dispersal. Early in gynoecial development, patterning events divide the primordium into distinct domains that will give rise to specific tissues and organs. The medial domain of the gynoecium gives rise to the ovules, and several other structures critical for reproductive competence. Here we report a synergistic genetic interaction between seuss and aintegumenta mutants resulting in a complete loss of ovule initiation and a reduction of the structures derived from the medial domain. We show that patterning events are disrupted early in the development of the seuss aintegumenta gynoecia and we identify PHABULOSA (PHB), REVOLUTA, and CRABS CLAW (CRC) as potential downstream targets of SEUSS (SEU) and AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) regulation. Our genetic data suggest that SEU additionally functions in pathways that are partially redundant and parallel to PHB, CRC, and ANT. Thus, SEU and ANT are part of a complex and robust molecular system that coordinates patterning cues and cellular proliferation along the three positional axes of the developing gynoecium.
