Despite intense research on light responses in plants, the consequences of a simple shift from light to darkness are largely unexplored. In this research, the physiological outcome and proteomic changes in Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures after switching from light to total darkness were examined. Deprivation of light led to a visible loss of chlorophyll and failure to develop functional chloroplasts that are present in light-grown cells. This response was accompanied by a significant increase in the cell multiplication rate, most likely due to decreased formation of the damaging reactive oxygen species in the dark. Additionally, there were significant changes in the abundance of 46 protein spots (mostly assigned to chloroplasts, mitochondria and membranes) which were resolved by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analysis. All identified chloroplast proteins were down-regulated in response to sustained darkness. In contrast, all differentially expressed proteins associated with cell wall biosynthesis were up-regulated by the dark treatment. Changes in the levels of these proteins were consistent with the observed morphological and physiological changes of the cells. These results reveal a comprehensive picture of the dark response in Arabidopsis cells and provide a useful platform for further characterization of gene function and regulation in plant responses to light.
