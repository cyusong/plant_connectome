Legumains or vacuolar processing enzymes are cysteine peptidases (C13 family, clan CD) with increasingly recognized physiological significance in plants. They have previously been classified as seed and vegetative legumains. In this work, the entire barley legumain family is described. The eight members of this family belong to the two phylogenetic clades in which the angiosperm legumains are distributed. An in-depth molecular and functional characterization of a barley legumain from each group, HvLeg-2 and HvLeg-4, was performed. Both legumains contained a signal peptide and were located in the endoplasmic reticulum, were expressed in seeds and vegetative tissues, and when expressed as recombinant proteins showed legumain and caspase proteolytic activities. However, the role of each protein seemed to be different in their target tissues. HvLeg-2 responded in leaves to biotic and abiotic stimuli, such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide, abscisic acid, and aphid infestation, and was induced by gibberellic acid in seeds, where the protein is able to degrade storage globulins. HvLeg-4 responded in leaves to wounding, nitric oxide, and abscisic acid treatments, and had an unknown role in the germinating seed. From these results, a multifunctional role was assumed for these two phylogenetically distant legumains, achieving different physiological functions in both seed and vegetative tissues.
