Although it is increasingly being recognized that roots play a key role in soil carbon (C) dynamics, the magnitude and direction of these effects are unknown. Roots can accelerate soil C losses by provisioning microbes with energy to decompose organic matter or impede soil C losses by enhancing microbial competition for nutrients. We experimentally reduced belowground C supply to soils via tree girdling, and contrasted responses in control and girdled plots for three consecutive growing seasons. We hypothesized that decreases in belowground C supply would have stronger effects in plots dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees rather than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees. In ECM-dominated plots, girdling decreased the activity of enzymes that break down soil organic matter (SOM) by c. 40%, indicating that, in control plots, C supply from ECM roots primes microbial decomposition. In AM-dominated plots, girdling had little effect on SOM-degrading enzymes, but increased the decomposition of AM leaf litter by c. 43%, suggesting that, in control plots, AM roots may intensify microbial competition for nutrients. Our findings indicate that root-induced changes in soil processes depend on forest composition, and that shifts in the distribution of AM and ECM trees owing to climate change may determine soil C gains and losses.

ECM roots: !prime! microbial decomposition
AM roots: !intensify! microbial competition for nutrients
girdling: !decreases! activity of enzymes that break down SOM
girdling: !increases! decomposition of AM leaf litter
