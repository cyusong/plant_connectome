Fungal endophytes establish symbiotic relationships with host plants, which results in a mutual growth benefit. However, little is known about the plant genetic response underpinning endophyte colonization. Phomopsis liquidambaris usually lives as an endophyte in a wide range of asymptomatic hosts and promotes biotic and abiotic stress resistance. In this study, we show that under low nitrogen conditions P. liquidambaris promotes rice growth in a hydroponic system, which is free of other microorganisms. In order to gain insights into the mechanisms of plant colonization by P. liquidambaris under low nitrogen conditions, we compared root and shoot transcriptome profiles of root-inoculated rice at different colonization stages. We determined that genes related to plant growth promotion, such as gibberellin and auxin related genes, were up-regulated at all developmental stages both locally and systemically. The largest group of up-regulated genes (in both roots and shoots) were related to flavonoid biosynthesis, which is involved in plant growth as well as antimicrobial compounds. Furthermore, genes encoding plant defense-related endopeptidase inhibitors were strongly up-regulated at the early stage of colonization. Together, these results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of plant-microbe mutualism and the promotion of plant growth by a fungal endophyte under nitrogen-deficient conditions.
