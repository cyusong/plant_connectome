The Arabidopsis U-box E3 ubiquitin ligases play an important role in the ubiquitin/26S proteasome-mediated protein degradation pathway. Recently, PUB30 has been reported to participate in the salt stress response during seed germination stage in abscisic acid (ABA)-independent manner, but the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we displayed that the pub30 mutant was more tolerant to salt stress during seed germination, whereas the mutant of its closest homologue PUB31 showed mild sensitivity to salt stress. PUB30 exhibited E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. PUB30 specifically interacted with BRI1 kinase inhibitor 1 (BKI1), a regulator playing dual roles in brassinosteroids signaling, in vitro and in vivo. We found that BKI1 protein was ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome. The degradation of BKI1 was slowed down in the pub30-1 mutant compared with that in the wild type. The bki1 mutant was sensitive to salt, whereas the transgenic plants overexpressing BKI1 showed salt tolerant phenotype. All these results indicate that PUB30 negatively regulates salt tolerance probably through regulating the degradation of BKI1 and brassinosteroids signaling in Arabidopsis.
