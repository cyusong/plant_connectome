['16962584', 'Calcium is known to serve as a secondary messenger to mediate salt stress  signaling pathway. We found a calcium-binding basic/helix-loop-helix-type  transcription factor (AtNIG1) as a salt stress-responsive gene by using the  suppression subtractive hybridization. The AtNIG1 was targeted into nucleus and  bound to (45)Ca(2+), suggesting that AtNIG1 is a nuclear calcium-binding protein.  In addition, AtNIG1 bound specifically to the E-box-DNA sequence (CANNTG), which  is found in the promoter regions of many salt stress-related genes. Functional  analyses with an atnig1-1 knockout mutant revealed that the mutant plants show  enhanced sensitivity to salt stress. Further analyses indicated that the atnig1-1  plants have reduced survival rate, fresh weight, chlorophyll content, and protein  content upon salt stress, suggesting that the AtNIG1 plays a critical role in  plant salt stress signaling. Therefore, this study represents that AtNIG1 is the  first known calcium-binding transcription factor involved in plant salt stress  signaling.', '2006 Oct 2', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2006.08.050', 'Kim']
