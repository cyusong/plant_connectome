Glutamic acid (Glu) is not only a protein amino acid, but also a signaling molecule, which takes part in various physiological processes in plants. Our previous study found that root-irrigation with Glu could improve the heat tolerance of maize seedlings by plant Glu receptor-like channels-mediated calcium signaling (Protoplasma, 2019; 256:1165-1169), but its molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, based on the our previous work, the maize seedlings were treated with 1 mM Glu prior to be exposed to heat stress (HS), and then the expression of genes related to related to methylglyoxal (MG)-scavenging and osmoregulation systems was quantified. The results showed that Glu treatment up-regulated the gene expression of <i>Zea mays</i> aldo-keto reductase (<i>ZmAKR</i>) under both non-HS and HS conditions. Also, the gene expression of <i>Zea mays</i> alkenal/alkenone reductase (<i>ZmAAR</i>), glyoxalase II (<i>ZmGly II</i>), pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (<i>ZmP5CS</i>), betaine dehydrogenase (<i>ZmBADH</i>), and trehalase (<i>ZmTRE</i>) was up-regualted by exogenous Glu treatment under HS conditions. These data imply that signaling molecule Glu initiated the expression of genes related to MG-scavenging and osmoregulation systems in maize seedlings, further supporting the fact that Glu-enhanced heat tolerance in plants.
