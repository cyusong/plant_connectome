RING (REALLY INTERESTING NEW GENE) proteins with E3 ligase activity are largely represented in plants. They have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of many biological processes by recognizing target proteins for ubiquitination. PtaRHE1, encoding a poplar RING-H2 domain-containing protein with E3 ligase activity has been previously shown to be expressed during the establishment of secondary vascular system in poplar. In the present report, we demonstrate that the expression of PtaRHE1 and the accumulation of its corresponding protein are modulated by the relative atmospheric and soil humidity and by abscisic acid. Overall, the integrated data are discussed within a working model highlighting a plausible function of PtaRHE1 in the signaling and/or in the regulation of water status in poplar.
