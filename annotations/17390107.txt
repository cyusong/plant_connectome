['17390107', 'Phytochelatins (PCs) are post-translationally synthesized thiol reactive peptides  that play important roles in detoxification of heavy metal and metalloids in  plants and other living organisms. The overall goal of this study is to develop  transgenic plants with increased tolerance for and accumulation of heavy metals  and metalloids from soil by expressing an Arabidopsis thaliana AtPCS1 gene,  encoding phytochelatin synthase (PCS), in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.). A  FLAG-tagged AtPCS1 gDNA, under its native promoter, is expressed in Indian  mustard, and transgenic pcs lines have been compared with wild-type plants for  tolerance to and accumulation of cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As). Compared to wild  type plants, transgenic plants exhibit significantly higher tolerance to Cd and  As. Shoots of Cd-treated pcs plants have significantly higher concentrations of  PCs and thiols than those of wild-type plants. Shoots of wild-type plants  accumulated significantly more Cd than those of transgenic plants, while  accumulation of As in transgenic plants was similar to that in wild type plants.  Although phytochelatin synthase improves the ability of Indian mustard to  tolerate higher levels of the heavy metal Cd and the metalloid As, it does not  increase the accumulation potential of these metals in the above ground tissues  of Indian mustard plants.', '2007 Jul', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-007-9158-7', 'Korban']
