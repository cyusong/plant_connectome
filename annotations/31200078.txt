Rice tiller angle is a key agronomic trait that contributes to ideal plant architecture and grain production. LAZY1 (LA1) was previously shown to control tiller angle via affecting shoot gravitropism, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified an LA1-interacting protein named Brevis Radix Like 4 (OsBRXL4). We showed that the interaction between OsBRXL4 and LA1 occurs at the plasma membrane and that their interaction determines nuclear localization of LA1. We found that nuclear localization of LA1 is essential for its function, which is different from AtLA1, its Arabidopsis ortholog. Overexpression of OsBRXL4 leads to a prostrate growth phenotype, whereas OsBRXLs RNAi plants, in which the expression levels of OsBRXL1, OsBRXL4, and OsBRXL5 were decreased, display a compact phenotype. Further genetic analysis also supported that OsBRXL4 controls rice tiller angle by affecting nuclear localization of LA1. Consistently, we demonstrated that OsBRXL4 regulates the shoot gravitropism through affecting polar auxin transport as did LA1. Taken together, our study not only identifies OsBRXL4 as a regulatory component of rice tiller angle but also provides new insights into genetic regulation of rice plant architecture.
