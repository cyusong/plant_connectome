['20729380', 'Plant vacuoles are essential multifunctional organelles largely distinct from  similar organelles in other eukaryotes. Embryo protein storage vacuoles and the  lytic vacuoles that perform a general degradation function are the best  characterized, but little is known about the biogenesis and transition between  these vacuolar types. Here, we designed a fluorescent marker-based forward  genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana and identified a protein affected  trafficking2 (pat2) mutant, whose lytic vacuoles display altered morphology and  accumulation of proteins. Unlike other mutants affecting the vacuole, pat2 is  specifically defective in the biogenesis, identity, and function of lytic  vacuoles but shows normal sorting of proteins to storage vacuoles. PAT2 encodes a  putative beta-subunit of adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) that can partially  complement the corresponding yeast mutant. Manipulations of the putative AP-3 beta  adaptin functions suggest a plant-specific role for the evolutionarily conserved  AP-3 beta in mediating lytic vacuole performance and transition of storage into the  lytic vacuoles independently of the main prevacuolar compartment-based  trafficking route.', '2010 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.075424', 'Friml']
