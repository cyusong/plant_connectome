['24803505', 'Plastid casein kinase 2 (CK2) is a major Ser/Thr-specific enzyme for protein  phosphorylation in the chloroplast stroma and its kinase activity is regulated by  redox signals. To understand the role of CK2 phosphorylation of chloroplast  proteins in abiotic stress signalling, an Arabidopsis plastid CK2 (CKA4) knockout  mutant was investigated in terms of the plant response to abscisic acid (ABA) and  heat stress. CKA4 expression was upregulated by ABA and heat treatment. The cka4  mutant showed reduced sensitivity to ABA during seed germination and seedling  growth, and increased stomatal aperture and leaf water loss with a slightly  reduced leaf ABA level. The cka4 mutant was more sensitive to heat stress than  the wild-type Columbia-0. The expression levels of a number of genes in the ABA  regulatory network were reduced in the cka4 mutant. Many heat-upregulated genes  (heat-shock factors and heat-shock proteins) were also reduced in the cka4  mutant. The cka4 mutant showed reduced expression levels of plastid-encoded RNA  polymerase target genes (atpB and psbA). CKA4 knockout mutation also resulted in  a reduction in expression of some critical genes (PTM, ABI4, and PRS1) involved  in retrograde signalling from the chloroplast to the nucleus. Similar results  were observed in mutant plants with the knockout mutation in both CKA4 and CKA3,  which encodes a nuclear CK2 alpha3 subunit. CKA3 expression was not responsive to ABA  and heat stress. These results suggest that CKA4 is an enhancing factor in  abiotic stress signalling through modulating the expression of some molecular  players in retrograde signalling.', '2014 Aug', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eru190', 'Guo']
