['20053710', "Levels of the enzymes that produce wound response mediators have to be controlled  tightly in unwounded tissues. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) fatty acid  oxygenation up-regulated8 (fou8) mutant catalyzes high rates of alpha -linolenic  acid oxygenation and has higher than wild-type levels of the alpha -linolenic  acid-derived wound response mediator jasmonic acid (JA) in undamaged leaves. fou8  produces a null allele in the gene SAL1 (also known as FIERY1 or FRY1).  Overexpression of the wild-type gene product had the opposite effect of the null  allele, suggesting a regulatory role of SAL1 acting in JA synthesis. The  biochemical phenotypes in fou8 were complemented when the yeast (Saccharomyces  cerevisiae) sulfur metabolism 3'(2'), 5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase MET22 was  targeted to chloroplasts in fou8. The data are consistent with a role of SAL1 in  the chloroplast-localized dephosphorylation of 3'-phospho-5'-adenosine  phosphosulfate to 5'-adenosine phosphosulfate or in a closely related reaction  (e.g. 3',5'-bisphosphate dephosphorylation). Furthermore, the fou8 phenotype was  genetically suppressed in a triple mutant (fou8 apk1 apk2) affecting  chloroplastic 3'-phospho-5'-adenosine phosphosulfate synthesis. These results  show that a nucleotide component of the sulfur futile cycle regulates early steps  of JA production and basal JA levels.", '2010 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.150474', 'Farmer']
