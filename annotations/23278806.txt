The hypothesis that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling is important in plant defences against metal stress has become accepted in recent years. To test the role of oxidative signal-inducible kinase (OXI1) in metal-induced oxidative signalling, the responses of oxi1 knockout lines to environmentally realistic cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) concentrations were compared with those of wild-type plants. A relationship between OXI1 and the activation of lipoxygenases and other initiators of oxylipin production was observed under these stress conditions, suggesting that lipoxygenase-1 may be a downstream component of OXI1 signalling. Metal-specific differences in OXI1 action were observed. For example, OXI1 was required for the up-regulation of antioxidative defences such as catalase in leaves and Fe-superoxide dismutase in roots, following exposure to Cu, processes that may involve the MEKK1-MKK2-WRKY25 cascade. Moreover, the induction of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases in Cu-exposed leaves was regulated by OXI1 in a manner that involves fluctuations in the expression of miRNA398. These observations contrast markedly with the responses to Cd exposure, which also involves OXI1-independent pathways but rather involves changes in components mediating intracellular communication.
