['17307924', 'Shoot branching patterns depend on a key developmental decision: whether axillary  buds grow out to give a branch or whether they remain dormant in the axils of  leaves. This decision is controlled by endogenous and environmental stimuli  mediated by hormonal signals. Although genes involved in the long-distance  signaling of this process have been identified, the genes responding inside the  buds to cause growth arrest remained unknown in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we  describe an Arabidopsis gene encoding a TCP transcription factor closely related  to teosinte branched1 (tb1) from maize (Zea mays), BRANCHED1 (BRC1), which  represents a key point at which signals controlling branching are integrated  within axillary buds. BRC1 is expressed in developing buds, where it arrests bud  development. BRC1 downregulation leads to branch outgrowth. BRC1 responds to  developmental and environmental stimuli controlling branching and mediates the  response to these stimuli. Mutant and expression analyses suggest that BRC1 is  downstream of the MORE AXILLARY GROWTH pathway and that it is required for  auxin-induced apical dominance. Therefore, BRC1 acts inside the buds as an  integrator of signals controlling bud outgrowth and translates them into a  response of cell growth arrest. The conservation of BRC1/tb1 function among  distantly related angiosperm species suggests that a single ancestral mechanism  of branching control integration evolved before the radiation of flowering  plants.', '2007 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.048934', 'Cubas']
