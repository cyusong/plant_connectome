['9636231', 'Temperate plants develop a greater ability to withstand freezing in response to a  period of low but nonfreezing temperatures through a complex, adaptive process of  cold acclimation. Very little is known about the signaling processes by which  plants perceive the low temperature stimulus and transduce it into the nucleus to  activate genes needed for increased freezing tolerance. To help understand the  signaling processes, we have isolated mutants of Arabidopsis that are  constitutively freezing-tolerant in the absence of cold acclimation. Freezing  tolerance of wild-type Arabidopsis was increased from -5.5 degreesC to -12.6  degreesC by cold acclimation whereas the freezing tolerance of 26 mutant lines  ranged from -6.8 degreesC to -10.6 degreesC in the absence of acclimation. Plants  with mutations at the eskimo1 (esk1) locus accumulated high levels of proline, a  compatible osmolyte, but did not exhibit constitutively increased expression of  several cold-regulated genes involved in freezing tolerance. RNA gel blot  analysis suggested that proline accumulation in esk1 plants was mediated by  regulation of transcript levels of genes involved in proline synthesis and  degradation. The characterization of esk1 mutants and results from other mutants  suggest that distinct signaling pathways activate different aspects of cold  acclimation and that activation of one pathway can result in considerable  freezing tolerance without activation of other pathways.', '1998 Jun 23', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.95.13.7799', 'Browse']
