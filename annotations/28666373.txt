Plant morphogenesis depends on the synchronized anisotropic expansion of individual cells in response to developmental and environmental cues. The magnitude of cell expansion depends on the biomechanical properties of the cell wall, which in turn depends on both its biosynthesis and extensibility. Although the control of cell expansion by the phytohormone auxin is well established, its regulation of cell wall composition, trafficking of H+-ATPases, and K+ influx that drives growth is still being elucidated. Furthermore, the maintenance of auxin fluxes via the interaction between the cytoskeleton and PIN protein recycling on the plasma membrane remains under investigation. This review proposes a model that describes how the cell wall, auxin, microtubule binding-protein CLASP and Kin7/separase complexes, and vesicle trafficking are co-ordinated on a cellular level to mediate cell wall loosening during cell expansion.
