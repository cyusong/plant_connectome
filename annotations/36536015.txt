International databases and data aggregators on species conservation status are powerful tools supporting the efforts of conservation biologists and practitioners in reducing the loss of biodiversity. However, out-of-date information and poor interoperability of databases can hamper conservation of highly threatened species or in extreme cases can result in their removal from conservation frameworks. Lack of common standards for database updates, slow update timing and incongruencies among datasets in terms of taxonomy, threats, conservation status and holding prevent proper conservation prioritization and actions. A simple survey to solve incongruencies between the BGCI PlantSearch Database and the IUCN Red List resulted in a change of status of 16 plant species, including the 'rehabilitation' of 12 species thought to be extinct.
