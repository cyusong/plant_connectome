Sugar acts as an important nutrient for plant development. Previously, we reported that <i>Oryza sativa DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER 11</i> (<i>OsDOF11</i>) plays a crucial role in sucrose transport by binding promoters of sucrose transporter genes, <i>OsSUT1, OsSWEET11</i>, and <i>OsSWEET14</i>. Meanwhile, sucrose transport activity abnormal also involved susceptibility to infection of <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pathovar <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>) by <i>OsSWEET</i> genes. Here, we provid an addendum, that <i>OsDOF11</i> expression pattern in spikelet development stage, and transcript levels of <i>OsSWEET12, OsSWEET13, OsSWEET15</i>, and <i>OsSWEET16</i> in the mutants of <i>OsDOF11</i> at different developmental stages. This information further supplied a new insight that sucrose transport activity mediated susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i> infection.
