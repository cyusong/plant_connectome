Floral volatiles are complex, multi-functional signals that are often used by pollinators in combination with other signals, such as color. Floral visitors use floral scent to estimate the amount of reward present in flowers, to facilitate the identification of a specific host flower or as signals that chemically resemble those important for pollinator insects in other ecological contexts. There is good evidence that floral scent evolves under selection imposed by both mutualists and antagonists. Antagonists may often limit the amount of scent emitted by flowers, thus contributing to spatial population variation, and select for phenotypic plasticity after enemy attack. Floral scent is also an important component of pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation, as it often co-varies with color and morphology in sister species with different pollination systems.
