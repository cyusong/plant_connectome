Parasitic plants establish vascular-conducting cells in an intrusive organ called haustorium. In haustoria of a stem parasitic plant, Cuscuta japonica, the presence of cells expressing cell-type-specific genes of phloem companion cell, phloem sieve element, procambial cell and xylem vessel has recently been demonstrated. Differentiation of these vascular cells is regulated in a manner similar to that in conventional vascular tissues. However, the initiation of procambial cells occurs concomitantly with the differentiation of vascular-conducting cells. The differentiation process of phloem also differed from that of conventional vascular tissues because enucleation of sieve elements appeared to be impeded. These results collectively imply that the vascular differentiation process in haustoria of parasitic plants may be different from that in conventional vascular tissues.
