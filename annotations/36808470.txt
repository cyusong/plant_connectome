Soybean is a major plant protein source for both human food and animal feed, but to meet global demands as well as a trend toward regional production, soybean cultivation needs to be expanded to higher latitudes. In this study, we developed a large diversity panel consisting of 1,503 early-maturing soybean lines and used genome-wide association mapping to dissect the genetic architecture underlying two crucial adaptation traits, flowering time and maturity. This revealed several known maturity loci, E1, E2, E3, and E4, and the growth habit locus Dt2 as causal candidate loci and also a novel putative causal locus, GmFRL1, encoding a protein homologous to the vernalization pathway gene FRIGIDA-like 1. In addition, the scan for QTL-by-environment interactions identified GmAPETALA1d as a candidate gene for a QTL with environment-dependent reversed allelic effects. The polymorphisms of these candidate genes were identified using whole-genome resequencing data of 338 soybeans, which also revealed a novel E4 variant, e4-par, carried by 11 lines with nine of them originating from Central Europe. Collectively, our results illustrate how combinations of QTL and their interactions with the environment facilitate the photothermal adaptation of soybean to regions far beyond its center of origin.
