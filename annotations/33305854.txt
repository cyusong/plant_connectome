Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are 20-24 nucleotides long non-coding RNA sequences identified and characterized in multiple plant and animal systems. miRNAs play multifarious roles ranging from plant development to stress tolerance by synchronizing physiological processes at the level of transcription and translation. Banana is a major horticultural crop with colossal production worldwide. Despite the recent encouraging developments, the information on functions of miRNAs in banana plants is still in its infancy. The available literature pertaining to miRNAs in banana plants hints towards their contribution as master regulators in crucial physiological processes for instance abiotic stress responses, pathogenic defence response, fruit ripening and so on. This review is focused on biogenesis of miRNAs, their identification and deciphering their respective roles in banana plants with special emphasis on abiotic stress responses, plant immune responses, fruit ripening and storage. Based on the prior reports, we identified a few miRNAs with prospective roles in stress tolerance and illustrated the potential applications of miRNAs in banana crop improvement utilizing recent biotechnological tools such as CRISPR cas9, RNAi and the nano particle based foliar spray of miRNAs. The review briefly explained the future directions in banana research with a special emphasis on miRNA regulatory networks and agronomic traits improvement. Finally, future domains in miRNA research in plants and their possible applications towards crop improvement in agriculture are described briefly.
