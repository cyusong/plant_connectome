Here, orthologous genes of six phosphate transporter (PiT) genes, which are members of the Pht1 and Pht2 families in tomato and potato, have been cloned from the solanaceous species pepper, eggplant and tobacco. Overall, expressions of these genes in pepper, eggplant and tobacco showed similar patterns to those in tomato and potato: P-starvation enhancement in both leaves and roots for Pht1;1, P-depletion induction exclusively in roots for Pht1;2, mycorrhizal enhancement for Pht1;3, and mycorrhizal induction for both Pht1;4 and Pht1;5. In the roots of nonmycorrhizal eggplant, SmPht1;3, SmPht1;4 and SmPht1;5 were also expressed under extreme P starvation. Mycorrhizal symbiosis under high-P supply conditions reduced plant growth, with concurrent enhancement of Pht1;2 expression in the roots of pepper as well as eggplant. In addition, the mycorrhizal symbiosis down-regulated the expression of Pht2;1 genes greatly in the leaves of pepper and tobacco. The discrepancies between the evolutionary distances of the PiT genes and their expression patterns among the five species suggest greater complexity in function of PiT in plants than previously expected.
