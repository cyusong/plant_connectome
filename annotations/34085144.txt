Heteromannans are the predominant hemicelluloses in the gametophytic stem of the moss Hypnodendron menziesii and occur in the walls of all cell types Little is known about the cell-wall polysaccharides of mosses. Monosaccharide analysis of cell walls isolated from the stem of the umbrella moss Hypnodendron menziesii was consistent with heteromannans, probably galactoglucomannans, being the predominant hemicellulosic polysaccharides in the walls. Immunofluorescence and immunogold microscopy with the monoclonal antibody LM21, specific for heteromannans, showed that these polysaccharides were present in the walls of all stem cell types. These cell types, except the hydroids, have secondary walls. Experiments in which sections were pre-treated with 0.1 M sodium carbonate and with the enzyme pectate lyase indicated that the heteromannans have O-acetyl groups that limit LM21 binding and the cell walls contain pectic homogalacturonan that masks detection of heteromannans using LM21. Therefore, to fully detect heteromannans in the cell walls, it was essential to use these pre-treatments to remove the O-acetyl groups from the heteromannans and pectic homogalacturonan from the cell walls. Fluorescence microscopy experiments with a second monoclonal antibody, LM22, also specific for heteromannans, showed similar results, but the binding was considerably weaker than with LM21, possibly as a result of subtle structural differences in the epitopes of the two antibodies. Although heteromannans occur abundantly in the cell walls of many species in basal lineages of tracheophytes, prior to the present study, research on the distribution of these polysaccharides in the walls of different cell types in mosses was confined to the model species Physcomitrium patens.
