['14749489', 'Specific protein degradation has been observed in several aspects of development  and differentiation in many organisms. One example of such proteolysis is  regulated by protein polyubiquitination that is promoted by the SCF complex  consisting of Skp1, cullin, and an F-box protein. We examined the activities of  the Arabidopsis Skp1-related proteins (ASKs). Among 19 annotated ASK genes, we  isolated 16 of the corresponding cDNAs (ASK1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,  14, 16, 17, 18, 19), and examined their gene products for interactions with 24  representatives of F-box proteins carrying various classes of the C-terminal  domains using the yeast two-hybrid system. As a result, we found diverse binding  specificities: ASK1, ASK2, ASK11 and ASK12 interacted well with COI1, FKF1,  UFO-like protein, LRR-containing F-box proteins, and other F-box proteins with  unknown C-terminal motifs. We also observed specific interaction between F-box  proteins and ASK3, ASK9, ASK13, ASK14, ASK16 and ASK18. In contrast, we detected  no interaction between any of the 12 ASK proteins and F-box proteins containing  CRFA, CRFB or CRFC domains. Both histochemical and RT-PCR analysis of eight ASK  genes expression revealed unique expression patterns for the respective genes.', '2004 Jan', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pch009', 'Matsui']
