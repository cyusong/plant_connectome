The chloroplast has recently emerged as pivotal to co-ordinating plant defence responses and as a target of plant pathogens. Beyond its central position in oxygenic photosynthesis and primary metabolism - key targets in the complex virulence strategies of diverse pathogens - the chloroplast integrates, decodes and responds to environmental signals. The capacity of chloroplasts to synthesize phytohormones and a diverse range of secondary metabolites, combined with retrograde and reactive oxygen signalling, provides exquisite flexibility to both perceive and respond to biotic stresses. These processes also represent a plethora of opportunities for pathogens to evolve strategies to directly or indirectly target 'chloroplast immunity'. This review covers the contribution of the chloroplast to pathogen associated molecular pattern and effector triggered immunity as well as systemic acquired immunity. We address phytohormone modulation of immunity and surmise how chloroplast-derived reactive oxygen species underpin chloroplast immunity through indirect evidence inferred from genetic modification of core chloroplast components and direct pathogen targeting of the chloroplast. We assess the impact of transcriptional reprogramming of nuclear-encoded chloroplast genes during disease and defence and look at future research challenges.
