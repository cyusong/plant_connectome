Arabidopsis ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4) positively regulates the protein repairing enzyme (PRE) PROTEIN L-ISOASPARTYL METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (PIMT1) in seed for its implication in seed vigor and longevity. PROTEIN L-ISOASPARTYL METHYLTRANSFERASE (PIMT) is a protein repairing enzyme (PRE) and is implicated in seed vigor and longevity. PIMT has been shown to be induced by ABA, however, its detailed regulation by ABA signaling components is unknown. Herein, we report that ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4) directly binds to the PIMT1 promoter and regulates its expression in Arabidopsis seeds. AtPIMT1 promoter analysis demonstrated the presence of putative ABI4 binding sites. Our Y1H analysis revealed that AtABI4 transcription factor binds to the AtPIMT1 promoter. Dual luciferase assay also demonstrated the binding of the AtABI4 transcription factor to the AtPIMT1 promoter. Subsequently, we have generated AtPIMT1 promoter GUS lines and revealed that ABA induced expression of GUS in Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression analyses exhibited reduced accumulation of PIMT1 protein and transcript with significant reduction in total PIMT activity in abi4-1 mutants as compared to that of the wild type. The AtPIMT1 promoter GUS expression in abi4-1 mutants was also found to be severely affected in both the control and ABA treatment. Hence, through molecular and genetic evidences we show that the AtABI4 plays a central role in regulating the expression of AtPIMT1 to impart seed vigor and longevity to orthodox seeds.
