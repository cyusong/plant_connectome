Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a key modulator of the development and architecture of the root system under physiological and adverse environmental conditions. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub> S) also exert myriad functions on plant development and signalling. Accumulating pieces of evidence show that depending upon the dose and mode of applications, NO and H<sub>2</sub> S can have synergistic or antagonistic actions in mediating H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> signalling during root development. Thus, H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> -NO-H<sub>2</sub> S crosstalk might essentially impart tolerance to elude oxidative stress in roots. Growth and proliferation of root apex involve crucial orchestration of NO and H<sub>2</sub> S-mediated ROS signalling which also comprise other components including mitogen-activated protein kinase, cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. This assessment provides a comprehensive update on the cooperative roles of NO and H<sub>2</sub> S in modulating H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> homoeostasis during root development, abiotic stress tolerance, and root-microbe interaction. Furthermore, it also analyses the scopes of some fascinating future investigations associated with strigolactone and karrikins concerning H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> -NO-H<sub>2</sub> S crosstalk in plant roots.
