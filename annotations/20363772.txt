['20363772', 'The TCP transcription factors control multiple developmental traits in diverse  plant species. Members of this family share an approximately 60-residue-long TCP  domain that binds to DNA. The TCP domain is predicted to form a basic  helix-loop-helix (bHLH) structure but shares little sequence similarity with  canonical bHLH domain. This classifies the TCP domain as a novel class of DNA  binding domain specific to the plant kingdom. Little is known about how the TCP  domain interacts with its target DNA. We report biochemical characterization and  DNA binding properties of a TCP member in Arabidopsis thaliana, TCP4. We have  shown that the 58-residue domain of TCP4 is essential and sufficient for binding  to DNA and possesses DNA binding parameters comparable to canonical bHLH  proteins. Using a yeast-based random mutagenesis screen and site-directed  mutants, we identified the residues important for DNA binding and dimer  formation. Mutants defective in binding and dimerization failed to rescue the  phenotype of an Arabidopsis line lacking the endogenous TCP4 activity. By  combining structure prediction, functional characterization of the mutants, and  molecular modeling, we suggest a possible DNA binding mechanism for this class of  transcription factors.', '2010 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.066647', 'Nath']
