Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) is a critical regulator of the antioxidant defence system in response to various stimuli. However, how MPK directly and exactly regulates antioxidant enzyme activities is still unclear. Here, we demonstrated that a NAC transcription factor ZmNAC49 mediated the regulation of antioxidant enzyme activities by ZmMPK5. ZmNAC49 expression is induced by oxidative stress. ZmNAC49 enhances oxidative stress tolerance in maize, and it also reduces superoxide anion generation and increases superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. A detailed study showed that ZmMPK5 directly interacts with and phosphorylates ZmNAC49 in vitro and in vivo. ZmMPK5 directly phosphorylates Thr-26 in NAC subdomain A of ZmNAC49. Mutation at Thr-26 of ZmNAC49 does not affect the interaction with ZmMPK5 and its subcellular localisation. Further analysis found that ZmNAC49 activates the ZmSOD3 expression by directly binding to its promoter. ZmMPK5-mediated ZmNAC49 phosphorylation improves its ability to bind to the ZmSOD3 promoter. Thr-26 of ZmNAC49 is essential for its transcriptional activity. In addition, ZmSOD3 enhances oxidative stress tolerance in maize. Our results show that phosphorylation of Thr-26 in ZmNAC49 by ZmMPK5 increased its DNA-binding activity to the ZmSOD3 promoter, enhanced SOD activity and thereby improved oxidative stress tolerance in maize.
