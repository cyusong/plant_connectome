SUMO is a protein modification whose conjugate levels peak during acute heat stress. We find that SUMO is also critical for plant longevity when Arabidopsis experiences a prolonged non-damaging period of only 28 degrees Celsius. Remarkably, this thermo-lethality at 28 degrees was not seen with any other mutant of the SUMO pathway tested. Autoimmunity due to low SUMO1/2 expression levels was not causal for this thermo-lethality. The role of SUMO for thermo-resilience was also distinct from its requirement for thermomorphogenesis - a growth response triggered by the same warm temperature, as only the latter response was dependent on the SUMO ligase SIZ1 as well. Thermo-resilience at 28 degrees Celsius and (acquired) thermotolerance (a response that allows plants to recover and acclimate to brief extreme temperatures) both depend on the HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A1 (HSFA1). Acquired thermotolerance was, however, normal in the sumo1/2 knockdown mutant. Thus, SUMO-dependent thermo-resilience is potentially controlled in a different way than the protein damage pathway that underpins thermotolerance. Close inspection of shoot apices revealed that the cell patterning and tissue integrity of the shoot apex of the SUMO1/2 knockdown mutant was lost at 28, but not 22 degrees Celsius. We thus describe a novel SUMO-dependent phenotype.
