Thioredoxins (Trxs) function within the antioxidant network through modulation of one or more redox reactions involved in oxidative-stress signaling. Given their function in regulating cellular redox, Trx proteins also fulfill key roles in plant immune signaling. Here, <i>TaTrxh1</i>, encoding a subgroup <i>h</i> member of the Trx family, was identified and cloned in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), which was rapidly induced by <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> invasion and salicylic acid (SA) treatment. Overexpression of <i>TaTrxh1</i> in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) induced programmed cell death. Silencing of <i>TaTrxh1</i> in wheat enhanced susceptibility to <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> in different aspects, including reactive oxygen species accumulation and pathogen-responsive or -related gene expression. Herein, we observed that the cellular concentration of SA was significantly reduced in <i>TaTrxh1</i>-silenced plants, indicating that <i>TaTrxh1</i> possibly regulates wheat resistance to stripe rust through a SA-associated defense signaling pathway. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify TaTrxh1-interacting partners, we further show that interaction with TaCP1 (a RD19-like cysteine protease) and subsequent silencing of <i>TaCP1</i> reduced wheat resistance to <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i>. In total, the data presented herein demonstrate that <i>TaTrxh1</i> enhances wheat resistance against <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> via SA-dependent resistance signaling and that TaTrxh1 interaction with TaCP1 is required for wheat resistance to stripe rust.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
