['16284310', 'The synthesis of cellulose microfibrils requires the presence of a membrane-bound  endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase, KORRIGAN1 (KOR1). Although the exact biochemical role  of KOR1 in cellulose synthesis is unknown, we used the protein as a marker to  explore the potential involvement of subcellular transport processes in cellulose  synthesis. Using immunofluorescence and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-KOR1  fusion that complemented the phenotype conferred by the kor1-1 mutant, we  investigated the distribution of KOR1 in epidermal cells in the root meristem.  KOR1 was localized in intracellular compartments corresponding to a heterogeneous  population of organelles, which comprised the Golgi apparatus, FM4-64-labeled  compartments referred to as early endosomes, and, in the case of GFP-KOR1, the  tonoplast. Inhibition of cellulose synthesis by isoxaben promoted a net  redistribution of GFP-KOR1 toward a homogeneous population of compartments,  distinct from early endosomes, which were concentrated close to the plasma  membrane facing the root surface. A redistribution of GFP-KOR1 away from early  endosomes was also observed in the same cells at later stages of cell elongation.  A subpopulation of GFP-KOR1-containing compartments followed trajectories along  the plasma membrane, and this motility required intact microtubules. These  observations demonstrate that the deposition of cellulose, like chitin synthesis  in yeast, involves the regulated intracellular cycling of at least one enzyme  required for its synthesis.', '2005 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.036228', 'Vernhettes']
