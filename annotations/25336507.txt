Self-incompatibility (SI) is the primary determinant of the outbreeding mode of sexual reproduction in the Brassicaceae. All Arabidopsis thaliana accessions analyzed to date carry mutations that disrupt SI functions by inactivating the SI specificity-determining S locus or SI modifier loci. S-locus genes isolated from self-incompatible close relatives of A. thaliana restore robust SI in several accessions that harbor only S-locus mutations and confer transient SI in accessions that additionally harbor mutations at modifier loci. Self-incompatible transgenic A. thaliana plants have proved to be valuable for analysis of the recognition and signaling events that underlie SI in the Brassicaceae. Here, we review results demonstrating that S-locus genes are necessary and sufficient for SI signaling and for restoration of a strong and developmentally stable SI phenotype in several accessions of A. thaliana. The data indicate that introduction of a functional E3 ligase-encoding ARC1 gene, which is deleted in all accessions that have been analyzed to date, is not required for SI signaling leading to inhibition of self pollen or for reversion of A. thaliana to its fully self-incompatible ancestral state.
