Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) has traditionally been considered harmful to agriculture because of its toxic effects in saline soils and its antagonistic interaction with nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>), which impairs NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> nutrition. It has been largely believed that Cl<sup>-</sup> antagonizes NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> uptake and accumulation in higher plants, reducing crop yield. However, we have recently uncovered that Cl<sup>-</sup> has new beneficial macronutrient, functions that improve plant growth, tissue water balance, plant water relations, photosynthetic performance, and water-use efficiency. The increased plant biomass indicates in turn that Cl<sup>-</sup> may also improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Considering that N availability is a bottleneck for the plant growth, the excessive NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> fertilization frequently used in agriculture becomes a major environmental concern worldwide, causing excessive leaf NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> accumulation in crops like vegetables and, consequently, a potential risk to human health. New farming practices aimed to enhance plant NUE by reducing NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> fertilization should promote a healthier and more sustainable agriculture. Given the strong interaction between Cl<sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> homeostasis in plants, we have verified if indeed Cl<sup>-</sup> affects NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> accumulation and NUE in plants. For the first time to our knowledge, we provide a direct demonstration which shows that Cl<sup>-</sup>, contrary to impairing of NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> nutrition, facilitates NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> utilization and improves NUE in plants. This is largely due to Cl<sup>-</sup> improvement of the N-NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> utilization efficiency (NU<sub>T</sub>E), having little or moderate effect on N-NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> uptake efficiency (NU<sub>P</sub>E) when NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> is used as the sole N source. Clear positive correlations between leaf Cl<sup>-</sup> content vs. NUE/NU<sub>T</sub>E or plant growth have been established at both intra- and interspecies levels. Optimal NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> vs. Cl<sup>-</sup> ratios become a useful tool to increase crop yield and quality, agricultural sustainability and reducing the negative ecological impact of NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> on the environment and on human health.
