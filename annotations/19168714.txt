Nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as a central signaling molecule in plants and animals. However, the long search for a plant NO synthase (NOS) enzyme has only encountered false leads. The first works describing a pathogen-induced NOS-like plant protein were soon retracted. New hope came from the identification of NOS1, an Arabidopsis thaliana protein with an atypical NOS activity that was found to be targeted to mitochondria in roots. Although concerns about the NO-producing activity of this protein were raised (causing the renaming of the protein to NO-associated 1), compelling data on its biological role were missing until recently. Strong evidence is now available that this protein functions as a GTPase that is actually targeted to plastids, where it might be required for ribosome function. These and other results support the argument that the defective NO production in loss-of-function mutants is an indirect effect of interfering with normal plastid functions and that plastids play an important role in regulating NO levels in plant cells.
