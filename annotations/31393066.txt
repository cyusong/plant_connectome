Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is a major crop and the main source of natural fiber worldwide. Because various abiotic and biotic stresses strongly influence cotton fiber yield and quality, improved stress resistance of this crop plant is urgently needed. In this study, we used Gateway technology to construct a normalized full-length cDNA overexpressing (FOX) library from upland cotton cultivar ZM12 under various stress conditions. The library was transformed into Arabidopsis to produce a cotton-FOX-Arabidopsis library. Screening of this library yielded 6,830 transgenic Arabidopsis lines, of which 757 were selected for sequencing to ultimately obtain 659 cotton ESTs. GO and KEGG analyses mapped most of the cotton ESTs to plant biological process, cellular component, and molecular function categories. Next, 156 potential stress-responsive cotton genes were identified from the cotton-FOX-Arabidopsis library under drought, salt, ABA, and other stress conditions. Four stress-related genes identified from the library, designated as GhCAS, GhAPX, GhSDH, and GhPOD, were cloned from cotton complementary DNA, and their expression patterns under stress were analyzed. Phenotypic experiments indicated that overexpression of these cotton genes in Arabidopsis affected the response to abiotic stress. The method developed in this study lays a foundation for high-throughput cloning and rapid identification of cotton functional genes.
