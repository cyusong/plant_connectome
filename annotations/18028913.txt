3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) is unique in the first part of the cytoplasmic isoprenoid pathway, as it contains a membrane domain that includes ER-specific retention motifs. When fused to GFP, this domain targets two tobacco BY-2 HMGR isoforms differentially. While the first isoform is ER-localized, a second stress-induced one forms globular structures connected by tubular structures. A serine positioned upstream of the ER retention motif seems to be implicated in this specific subcellular localization. Surprisingly, these structures are closely connected to F-actin, and their intactness is dependent upon the integrity of the filaments or the action of a calmodulin antagonist.
