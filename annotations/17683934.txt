['17683934', 'Membrane vesicle traffic to and from the plasma membrane is essential for  cellular homeostasis in all eukaryotes. In plants, constitutive traffic to and  from the plasma membrane has been implicated in maintaining the population of  integral plasma-membrane proteins and its adjustment to a variety of hormonal and  environmental stimuli. However, direct evidence for evoked and selective traffic  has been lacking. Here, we report that the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), which  controls ion transport and transpiration in plants under water stress, triggers  the selective endocytosis of the KAT1 K+ channel protein in epidermal and guard  cells. Endocytosis of the K+ channel from the plasma membrane initiates in  concert with changes in K+ channel activities evoked by ABA and leads to  sequestration of the K+ channel within an endosomal membrane pool that recycles  back to the plasma membrane over a period of hours. Selective K+ channel  endocytosis, sequestration, and recycling demonstrates a tight and dynamic  control of the population of K+ channels at the plasma membrane as part of a key  plant signaling and response mechanism, and the observations point to a role for  channel traffic in adaptive changes in the capacity for osmotic solute flux of  stomatal guard cells.', '2007 Aug 21', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2007.07.020', 'Blatt']
