['18755683', 'We studied molecular and functional properties of Arabidopsis phosphomannose  isomerase isoenzymes (PMI1 and PMI2) that catalyze reversible isomerization  between D-fructose 6-phosphate and D-mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6P). The apparent  K(m) and V(max) values for Man-6P of purified recombinant PMI1 were 41.3+/-4.2  microm and 1.89 micromol/min/mg protein, respectively, whereas those of purified  recombinant PMI2 were 372+/-13 microm and 22.5 micromol/min/mg protein,  respectively. Both PMI1 and PMI2 were inhibited by incubation with EDTA, Zn(2+),  Cd(2+), and L-ascorbic acid (AsA). Arabidopsis PMI1 protein was constitutively  expressed in both vegetative and reproductive organs under normal growth  conditions, whereas the PMI2 protein was not expressed in any organs under light.  The induction of PMI1 expression and an increase in the AsA level were observed  in leaves under continuous light, whereas the induction of PMI2 expression and a  decrease in the AsA level were observed under long term darkness. PMI1 showed a  diurnal expression pattern in parallel with the total PMI activity and the total  AsA content in leaves. Moreover, a reduction of PMI1 expression through RNA  interference resulted in a substantial decrease in the total AsA content of  leaves of knockdown PMI1 plants, whereas the complete inhibition of PMI2  expression did not affect the total AsA levels in leaves of knock-out PMI2  plants. Consequently, this study improves our understanding of the molecular and  functional properties of Arabidopsis PMI isoenzymes and provides genetic evidence  of the involvement of PMI1, but not PMI2, in the biosynthesis of AsA in  Arabidopsis plants.', '2008 Oct 24', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M805538200', 'Shigeoka']
