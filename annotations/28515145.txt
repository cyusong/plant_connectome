In plants, microRNA (miRNA)-target complementarity has long been considered the predominant factor determining the silencing outcome of the miRNA-target interaction, although the efficacy of such interactions have rarely been appraised in plants. Here, we perform in planta silencing efficacy assays on seven Arabidopsis <i>MYB</i> genes, all of which contain conserved miR159-binding sites of analogous complementarity. These genes were found to be differentially silenced by miR159; <i>MYB81</i>, <i>MYB97</i>, <i>MYB101</i>, <i>MYB104</i>, and <i>DUO1</i> were all poorly silenced, whereas <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were strongly silenced. Curiously, this is consistent with previous genetic analysis defining <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> as the major functional targets of miR159. Neither the free energy of miR159-target complementarity, nor miRNA binding site accessibility, as determined by flanking region AU content, could fully explain the discrepancy of miR159 silencing efficacy. Instead, we found that <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were both predicted to contain a distinctive RNA secondary structure abutting the miR159 binding site. The structure is composed of two stem-loops (SLs) that are predicted to form in <i>MYB33</i>/65 homologs of species as evolutionary distant as gymnosperms. Functional analysis found that the RNA structure in <i>MYB33</i> correlated with strong silencing efficacy; introducing mutations to disrupt either SL attenuated miR159 efficacy, while introducing complementary mutations to restore the SLs, but not the sequence, restored strong miR159-mediated silencing. Therefore, it appears that this RNA secondary structure demarcates <i>MYB33</i>/<i>65</i> as sensitive targets of miR159, which underpins the narrow functional specificity of Arabidopsis miR159.
