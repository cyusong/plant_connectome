The maturation and development of tomato fruit has received much attention due both to the complexity and intricacy of the changes which occur during this process and to the importance of these fruits as a component of the human diet. Whilst great advances have been made in understanding molecular genetic aspects of fruit development, our knowledge concerning the metabolic shifts underpinning this process remains largely confined to primary metabolism. Conversely, the majority of the metabolites considered to have health benefits are secondary or specialized metabolites. Prior to assessing the role (if any) of these metabolites in tomato fruit development, considerable effort will be required in order to better describe the complement of secondary metabolites in the tomato and to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved in their synthesis and degradation. Advances in tomato secondary metabolism will be reviewed here focusing on the use of metabolomics strategies and, where applicable, the enabling of these strategies by their coupling to information resident in the tomato genome sequence.
