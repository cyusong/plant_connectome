We report here, the transcriptional regulation of 2 Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases in response to nutrient starvation of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii vegetative cells. The CDPK proteins, CDPK1 and CDPK3; share 53% identity among themselves, a maximum of 57% and 52% to higher plants respectively and 42% to apicomplexan protozoans. We expressed a CDPK1-GFP fusion protein in the C. reinhardtii vegetative cells and showed its distribution both in the cell body and the membrane-matrix fraction of the flagella. The fusion protein exhibits mobility shift in the presence of Ca (2+), confirming its Ca (2+)-binding properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of transcriptional regulation of CDPKs from a unicellular chlorophyte in response to nutrient starvation namely acetate (A), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N).
