The application of effective microorganisms (EMs) and/or nitrogen (N) have a stimulating effect on plants against abiotic stress conditions. The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of the co-application of EMs and N on growth, physio-biochemical attributes, anatomical structures, nutrients acquisition, capsaicin, protein, and osmoprotectant contents, as well as the antioxidative defense system of hot pepper (<i>Capsicum annum</i> L.) plants. In the field trials, EMs were not applied (EMs<sup>-</sup>) or applied (EMs<sup>+</sup>) along with three N rates of 120, 150, and 180 kg unit N ha<sup>-1</sup> (designated as N<sub>120</sub>, N<sub>150</sub>, and N<sub>180</sub>, respectively) to hot pepper plants grown in saline soils (9.6 dS m<sup>-1</sup>). The application of EMs and/or high N levels attenuated the salt-induced damages to hot pepper growth and yield. The application of EMs<sup>+</sup> with either N<sub>150</sub> or N<sub>180</sub> increased the number, average weight and yield of fruits by 14.4 or 17.0%, 20.8 or 20.8% and 28.4 or 27.5%, respectively, compared to hot pepper plants treated with the recommended dose (EMs<sup>-</sup> × N<sub>150</sub>). When EMs<sup>+</sup> was individually applied or combined with either N<sub>150</sub> or N<sub>180</sub>, increased accumulation of capsaicin were observed by 16.7 or 20.8%, protein by 12.5 or 16.7%, proline by 19.0 or 14.3%, and total soluble sugars by 3.7 or 7.4%, respectively, in comparison with those treated with the integrative EMs<sup>-</sup> × N<sub>150</sub>. In addition, the non-enzymatic contents (ascorbate, and glutathione) and enzymatic activities (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase) of the antioxidant defense systems significantly increased in hot pepper plants treated with EMs<sup>+</sup> alone or combined with N<sub>150</sub> or N<sub>180</sub> under salt stress conditions. Higher accumulation of nutrients (N, P, K<sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) along with reduced Na<sup>+</sup> acquisition was also evidenced in response to EMs<sup>+</sup> or/and high N levels. Most anatomical features of stems and leaves recovered in hot pepper plants grown in saline soils and supplied with EMs<sup>+</sup> and N. The application of EMs and N is undoubtedly opening new sustainable approaches toward enhancing abiotic stress tolerance in crops (e.g. hot pepper).
