This review contains functional roles of NAC transcription factors in the transcriptional regulation of ripening in tomato fruit, describes the interplay between ABA/ethylene and NAC TFs in tomato fruit ripening. Fruit ripening is regulated by a complex network of transcription factors (TFs) and genetic regulators in response to endogenous hormones and external signals. Studying the regulation of fruit ripening has important significance for controlling fruit quality, enhancing nutritional value, improving storage conditions and extending shelf-life. Plant-specific NAC (named after no apical meristem (NAM), Arabidopsis transcription activator factor 1/2 (ATAF1/2) and Cup-shaped cotyledon (CUC2)) TFs play essential roles in plant development, ripening and stress responses. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on the regulation of NAC TFs in fruit ripening, discuss the interactions between NAC and other factors in controlling fruit development and ripening, and emphasize how NAC TFs are involved in tomato fruit ripening through the ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) pathways. The signaling network regulating ripening is complex, and both hormones and individual TFs can affect the status or activity of other network participants, which can alter the overall ripening network regulation, including response signals and fruit ripening. Our review helps in the systematic understanding of the regulation of NAC TFs involved in fruit ripening and provides a basis for the development or establishment of complex ripening regulatory network models.
