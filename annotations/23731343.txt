SGT1 (Suppressor of G2 allele of SKP1) is required to maintain plant disease Resistance (R) proteins with Nucleotide-Binding (NB) and Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) domains in an inactive but signaling-competent state. SGT1 is an integral component of a multi-protein network that includes RACK1, Rac1, RAR1, Rboh, HSP90 and HSP70, and in rice the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), OsMAPK6. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) N protein, which belongs to the Toll-Interleukin Receptor (TIR)-NB-LRR class of R proteins, confers resistance to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). Following transient expression in planta, we analyzed the functional relationship between SGT1, SIPK - a tobacco MAPK6 ortholog - and N, using mass spectrometry, confocal microscopy and pathogen assays. Here, we show that tobacco SGT1 undergoes specific phosphorylation in a canonical MAPK target-motif by SIPK. Mutation of this motif to mimic SIPK phosphorylation leads to an increased proportion of cells displaying SGT1 nuclear accumulation and impairs N-mediated resistance to TMV, as does phospho-null substitution at the same residue. Forced nuclear localization of SGT1 causes N to be confined to nuclei. Our data suggest that one mode of regulating nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of R proteins is by maintaining appropriate levels of SGT1 phosphorylation catalyzed by plant MAPK.
