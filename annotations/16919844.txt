Microsomal membranes were prepared from etiolated pea (Pisum sativum L.) epicotyls and used to form nascent [Uronic acid-14C]pectin. The enzyme products were characterized by selective enzymic degradation, gel permeation chromatography and analysis of cellulose binding properties. The product obtained had a molecular weight of around 40 kDa, which was significantly lower than that of nascent [Gal-14C]pectin prepared from the same tissues. It is composed mainly of polygalacturonan and perhaps also rhamnogalacturonan (RG-I). Evidence was obtained for the presence of a protein attached to the nascent [Uronic acid-14C]pectin, but it was unaffected by endoglucanase and did not bind to cellulose. Hence, no xyloglucan appeared to be attached to the nascent [Uronic acid-14C]pectin. A model is proposed in which xyloglucan is attached to nascent pectin after formation of homogalacturonan, but before the pectin leaves the Golgi apparatus.
