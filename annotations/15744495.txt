Feruloyltyramine (FT) and 4-coumaroyltyramine (4CT) participate in the defense of plants against pathogens through their extracellular peroxidative polymerization, which is thought to reduce cell wall digestibility. Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:tyramine N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase (THT; EC 2.3.1.110) and tyrosine decarboxylase (TYDC; EC 4.1.1.25) are purported to play key roles in the stress-induced regulation of tyramine-derived hydroxycinnamic acid amide (HCAAT) metabolism. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) was engineered to constitutively express tobacco THT. A T1 plant over-expressing THT was crossbred with T1 tobacco expressing opium poppy TYDC2, to produce a T2 line with elevated THT and TYDC activities compared with wild type plants. The effects of an independent increase in TYDC or THT activity, or a dual increase in both TYDC and THT on the cellular pools of HCAAT pathway intermediates and the accumulation of soluble and cell wall-bound FT and 4CT were examined. Increased TYDC activity resulted in a larger cellular pool of tyramine and lower levels of L-phenylalanine in transgenic leaves. In contrast, elevated THT activity reduced tyramine levels. HCAAT levels were low in healthy leaves, but were induced in response to wounding and accumulated around wound sites. Similarly, endogenous THT and TYDC activities were wound-induced. The rate of wound-induced HCAAT accumulation was highest in transgenic plants with elevated THT and TYDC activities showing that both enzymes exert control over the flux of intermediates involved in HCAAT biosynthesis under some conditions.
