['29928509', "The function of abscisic acid (ABA) is mediated by its receptors termed  RCARs/PYR1/PYLs. Modulation of ABA signaling is vital for plant growth and  development. The RCAR-PP2C-SnRK2 regulatory modules have been defined as the core  components in ABA signaling. However, it is still not clear whether and how the  ABA receptors could be modified at the initial post-translational stage to  fine-tune ABA transduction pathway. Here we identify and characterize the  putative receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) in Arabidopsis named CARK1,  which interacts with RCAR3 (PYL8) and RCAR11 (PYR1) in the manner of  phosphorylation. Structural studies of CARK1 revealed the critical active site,  N204, which accounts for the kinase activity and the direct interaction with  RCAR3/RCAR11. CARK1 phosphorylates RCAR3/RCAR11 at one conserved threonine site,  T77/T78. Our genetic analyses further demonstrated that CARK1 positively  regulates ABA-mediated physiological responses and overexpression of CARK1 in  Arabidopsis distinctly promotes the drought resistance. Moreover, the  phosphor-mimic form of RCAR11 in the cark1 mutant is able to functionally  complement the ABA sensitivity. CARK1 positively regulates ABA-responsive gene  expression and enhances RCAR3/RCAR11's inhibition to Clade A PP2C. Taken  together, our studies strongly support the functional significance of CARK1 in  positively regulating ABA signaling via phosphorylation on RCAR3/RCAR11 in  Arabidopsis.", '2018', 'Cell Discov', '10.1038/s41421-018-0029-y', 'Yang']
