SHORT-ROOT (SHR) is a mobile transcription factor that plays important roles in ground tissue patterning, stem cell niche specification and maintenance, and vascular development in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. Although mRNA and protein of <i>SHR</i> are also found in hypocotyls, inflorescence stems, and leaves, its role in the above-ground organs has been less explored. In most developmental cases, SHR, together with its partner SCARECROW (SCR), regulates the expression of downstream target genes in controlling formative and proliferative cell divisions. Accumulating evidence on the regulatory role of SHR in shoots suggests that SHR may also play key roles in the above-ground organs. Interestingly, recent work has provided new evidence that SHR is also required for cell elongation in the hypocotyl of the etiolated seedling. This suggests that the novel roles of SHR and SHR-mediated regulatory networks can be found in shoots. Furthermore, comparative research on SHR function in roots and shoots will broaden and deepen our understanding of plant growth and development.
