Wheat grain yield is anticipated to suffer from the increased temperatures expected under climate change. In particular, the effects of post-anthesis temperatures on grain growth and development must be better understood in order to improve crop models. Grain growth and development involve several processes, and we hypothesized that some of the most important processes, namely grain dry biomass and water accumulation, grain volume expansion, and endosperm cell proliferation, will have different thermal sensitivity. To assess this, we established temperature-response curves of these processes for steady post-anthesis temperatures between 15 °C and 36 °C. From anthesis to maturity, grain dry mass, water mass, volume, and endosperm cell number were monitored, whilst considering grain temperature. Different sensitivities to heat of these various processes were revealed. The rate of grain dry biomass accumulation increased linearly up to 25 °C, while the reciprocal of its duration increased linearly up to at least 32 °C. In contrast, the growth rates of traits contributing to grain expansion, such as increase in grain volume and cell numbers, had higher optimum temperatures, while the reciprocal of their durations were significantly lower. These temperature-response curves can contribute to improve current crop models, and allow targeting of specific mechanisms for genetic and genomic studies.
