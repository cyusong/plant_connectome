Lowland acidic soils with water-logged regions are often affected by ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) toxicity, a major yield-limiting factor of rice production. Under severe Fe<sup>2+</sup> toxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are crucial, although molecular mechanisms and associated ROS homeostasis genes are still unknown. In this study, a comparative RNA-Seq based transcriptome analysis was conducted to understand the Fe<sup>2+</sup> toxicity tolerance mechanism in aromatic Keteki Joha. About 69 Fe homeostasis related genes and their homologs were identified, where most of the genes were downregulated. Under severe Fe<sup>2+</sup> toxicity, the biosynthesis of amino acids, RNA degradation, and glutathione metabolism were induced, whereas phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and fatty acid elongation were inhibited. The <i>mitochondrial iron transporter (OsMIT), vacuolar iron transporter 2 (OsVIT2), ferritin (OsFER), vacuolar mugineic acid transporter (OsVMT), phenolic efflux zero1 (OsPEZ1), root meander curling (OsRMC)</i>, and <i>nicotianamine synthase (OsNAS3)</i> were upregulated in different tissues, suggesting the importance of Fe retention and sequestration for detoxification. However, several antioxidants, ROS scavenging genes and abiotic stress-responsive transcription factors indicate ROS homeostasis as one of the most important defense mechanisms under severe Fe<sup>2+</sup> toxicity. Catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and glutathione reductase (GR) were upregulated. Moreover, abiotic stress-responsive transcription factors, no apical meristem (NAC), myeloblastosis (MYB), auxin response factor (ARF), basic helix-loop-helix (bZIP), WRKY, and C2H2-zinc finger protein (C2H2-ZFP) were also upregulated. Accordingly, ROS homeostasis has been proposed as an essential defense mechanism under such conditions. Thus, the current study may enrich the understanding of Fe-homeostasis in rice.
