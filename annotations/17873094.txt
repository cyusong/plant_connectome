['17873094', 'Phytohormone brassinosteroids (BRs) play critical roles in plant growth and  development. BR acts by modulating the phosphorylation status of two key  transcriptional factors, BRI1 EMS SUPPRESSOR1 and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 (BZR1),  through the action of BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1/BRI1 ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR  KINASE1 receptors and a GSK3 kinase, BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2). It is  still unknown how the perception of BR at the plasma membrane connects to the  expression of BR target genes in the nucleus. We show here that BZR1 functions as  a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and GSK3-like kinases induce the nuclear  export of BZR1 by modulating BZR1 interaction with the 14-3-3 proteins.  BR-activated phosphatase mediates rapid nuclear localization of BZR1. Besides the  phosphorylation domain for 14-3-3 binding, another phosphorylation domain in BZR1  is required for the BIN2-induced nuclear export of BZR1. Mutations of putative  phosphorylation sites in two distinct domains enhance the nuclear retention of  BZR1 and BR responses in transgenic plants. We propose that the spatial  redistribution of BZR1 is critical for proper BR signaling in plant growth and  development.', '2007 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.053728', 'Hwang']
