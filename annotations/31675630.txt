Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are extensively used as biofertilizers to improve the soil nutrition for a variety of crop plants. The plant-PGPR interaction, with special reference to chemical signalling molecules is not understood clearly, unlike other beneficial plant-microbe interactions. Chemo-attraction of a PGPR from soil microbial pool towards a plant could be dependent on some of the molecules in the plant root exudates (REs), similar to the beneficial association of legume-rhizobia. In this study, a few functional properties of PGPR like growth, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation by two PGPR strains viz., Bacillus sonorensis RS4 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa RP2 were assessed in the presence of groundnut REs. Functional properties of both the strains were significantly influenced by the REs in a strain-dependent manner. Metabolite profiling of the REs from PGPR-bacterized (RS4 or RP2) and non-bacterized seedlings was performed with GC-MS/MS after 12 and 24 days of growth. A total of 75 metabolites were detected in groundnut REs. Threonine and glyoxylic oxime acid were detected in RP2-bacterized REs, while serine, pentanoic acid, glucopyranoside, tartaric acid, and 2-pyrrolidinone were detected in REs of seedlings bacterized with RP2 and RS4. The results suggested that the PGPR induced distinct variations in the REs. Identification of the interaction-specific metabolites will be useful to develop effective PGPR based bio-formulations for better PGPR colonization and improving crop yields.
