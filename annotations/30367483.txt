Cupressaceae subfamily Callitroideae has been an important exemplar for vicariance biogeography, but its history is more than just disjunctions resulting from continental drift. We combine fossil and molecular data to better assess its extinction and, sometimes, rediversification after past global change. Key fossils were reassessed and their phylogenetic placement for calibration was determined using trait mapping and Bayes Factors. Five vicariance hypotheses were tested by comparing molecular divergence times with the timing of tectonic rifting. The role of adaptation to fire (serotiny) in its spread across a drying Australia was tested for Callitris. Our findings suggest that three transoceanic disjunctions within the Callitroideae probably arose from long-distance dispersal. A signature of extinction, centred on the end-Eocene global climatic chilling and drying, is evident in lineages-through-time plots and in the fossil record. Callitris, the most diverse extant callitroid genus, suffered extinctions but surviving lineages adapted and re-radiated into dry, fire-prone biomes that expanded in the Neogene. Serotiny, a key adaptation to fire, likely evolved in Callitris coincident with the biome shift. Both extinction and adaptive shifts have probably played major roles in this chronicle of turnover and renewal, but better understanding of biogeographical history requires improved taxonomy of fossils.
