['29396984', 'Many soluble and integral membrane proteins fold in the endoplasmic reticulum  (ER) with the help of chaperones and folding factors. Despite these efforts,  protein folding is intrinsically error prone and amino acid changes, alterations  in post-translational modifications or cellular stress can cause protein  misfolding. Folding-defective non-native proteins are cleared from the ER and  typically undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Here, we investigated whether  different misfolded glycoproteins require the same set of ERAD factors and are  directed to HRD1 complex-mediated degradation in plants. We generated a series of  glycoprotein ERAD substrates harboring a misfolded domain from Arabidopsis  STRUBBELIG or the BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITVE 1 receptor fused to different  membrane anchoring regions. We show that single pass and multispanning ERAD  substrates are subjected to glycan-dependent degradation by the HRD1 complex.  However, the presence of a powerful ER exit signal in the multispanning ERAD  substrates causes competition with ER quality control and targeting of misfolded  glycoproteins to the vacuole. Our results demonstrate that the same machinery is  used for degradation of topologically different misfolded glycoproteins in the ER  of plants.', '2018 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13851', 'ORCID:']
