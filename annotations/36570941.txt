Nudix hydrolases (NUDX) can hydrolyze a wide range of organic pyrophosphates and are widely distributed in various organisms. Previous studies have shown that NUDXs are extensively involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses in different plant species; however, the role of NUDXs in plant growth and development remains largely unknown. In the present study, we identified and characterized OsNUDX14 localized in the mitochondria in rice. Results showed that <i>OsNUDX14</i> is constitutively expressed in various tissues and most strongly expressed in mature leaves. We used CRISPR/Cas9 introducing mutations that editing <i>OsNUDX14</i> and its encoding product. <i>OsNUDX14-</i>Cas9 (<i>nudx14</i>) lines presented early flowering and a larger flag leaf angle during the reproductive stage. In addition, <i>OsNUDX14</i> affected grain chalkiness in rice. Furthermore, transcript profile analysis indicated that <i>OsNUDX14</i> is associated with lignin biosynthesis in rice. Six major haplotypes were identified by six <i>OsNUDX14</i> missense mutations, including Hap_1 to Hap_6. Accessions having the Hap_5 allele were geographically located mainly in South and Southeast Asia with a low frequency in the <i>Xian</i>/<i>indica</i> subspecies. This study revealed that <i>OsNUDX14</i> is associated with plant development and grain chalkiness, providing a potential opportunity to optimize plant architecture and quality for crop breeding.
