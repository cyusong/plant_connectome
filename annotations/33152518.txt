The rapid and enthusiastic adoption of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has demonstrated that this technology is far more than just another way to perform transcriptome analysis. It is not an exaggeration to say that the advent of scRNA-seq is revolutionizing the details of whole-transcriptome snapshots from a tissue to a cell. With this disruptive technology, it is now possible to mine heterogeneity between tissue types and within cells like never before. This enables more rapid identification of rare and novel cell types, simultaneous characterization of multiple different cell types and states, more accurate and integrated understanding of their roles in life processes, and more. However, we are only at the beginning of unlocking the full potential of scRNA-seq applications. This is particularly true for plant sciences, where single-cell transcriptome profiling is in its early stage and has many exciting challenges to overcome. In this review, we compare and evaluate recent pioneering studies using the Arabidopsis root model, which has established new paradigms for scRNA-seq studies in plants. We also explore several new and promising single-cell analysis tools that are available to those wishing to study plant development and physiology at unprecedented resolution and scale. In addition, we propose some future directions on the use of scRNA-seq technology to tackle some of the critical challenges in plant research and breeding.
