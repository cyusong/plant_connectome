['24097264', 'Arabidopsis cell growth defect factor-1 (Cdf1 in yeast, At5g23040) was originally  isolated as a cell growth suppressor of yeast from genetic screening. To  investigate the in vivo role of Cdf1 in plants, a T-DNA insertion line was  analyzed. A homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant (cdf1/cdf1) was embryo lethal and  showed arrested embryogenesis at the globular stage. The Cdf1 protein, when fused  with green fluorescent protein, was localized to the plastid in stomatal guard  cells and mesophyll cells. A promoter-beta-glucuronidase assay found expression of  Cdf1 in the early heart stage of embryogenesis, suggesting that Cdf1 was  essential for Arabidopsis embryogenesis during the transition of the embryo from  the globular to heart stage.', '2014 Jan', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-013-1966-1', 'Uchimiya']
