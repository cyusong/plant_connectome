['28887625', 'Leaves are the most important plant parts for photosynthesis and respiration.  Many genes are involved in determining leaf shape; however, little is known about  the effects of brassinosteroid (BR) signaling-pathway genes on the development of  leaf shape. Here, the brassinosteroid-responsive RING-H2 (BRH1) gene, which is  suppressed by 24-epi-brassinolide treatment, was isolated from Arabidopsis  thaliana. The amino acid sequence contained a highly conserved RING finger  domain. In a phylogenetic analysis, BRH1 clustered closely with GLYMA11G02470.1.  The leaves of brh1 mutant plants were not much different to those of the  wild-type, while transgenic plants with high BRH1 expression levels had rounder  rosette leaves. Mutants of the BR synthesis pathway also had a similar round leaf  phenotype, and greater BRH1 expression levels. Moreover, the related marker genes  KNAT1, AtHB13 and ROT4, which are known to control leaf shape, altered  transcriptional levels in both transgenic BRH1 and BR-synthesis mutant lines.  Thus, BRH1 may be involved in the BR signaling pathway and regulate the growth  and development of rosette leaves. Research on BRH1 may prove valuable for  understanding the regulatory mechanism of leaf shape and improving the leaf  shapes of ornamental plants.', '2018 Jan', 'Sci China Life Sci', '10.1007/s11427-017-9133-8', 'Zhang']
