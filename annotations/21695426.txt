['21695426', 'The homozygous T-DNA mutants of AtCAL1 (Rat1) and AtCAL2 (Rat2) were obtained.  The double mutant of Rat2/Rat1RNAi was constructed which showed obvious  late-flowering phenotype from others. The expression of various flowering-related  genes was studied among mutants and wild-type plants by quantitative RT-PCR. The  double mutant plants showed the shortest root length compared with T-DNA  insertion mutants and wild type plants under red light, blue light, and white  light. The double mutants showed hypersensitivity to NaCl and ABA. However, these  mutants had no effect on stomatal closure by ABA.', '2012 Feb', 'Mol Biol Rep', '10.1007/s11033-011-0891-2', 'Liu']
