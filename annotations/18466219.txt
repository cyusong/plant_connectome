Plants can show remarkable responses to small changes in temperature, yet one of the great unknowns in plant science is how that temperature signal is perceived. The identity of the early components of the temperature signal transduction pathway also remains a mystery. To understand the consequences of anthropogenic environmental change we will have to learn much more about the basic biology of how plants sense temperature. Recent advances show that many known plant-temperature responses share common signalling components, and suggest ways in which these might be linked to form a plant temperature signalling network.
