Root-lesion nematodes (<i>Pratylenchus</i> spp.) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) occupy the same ecological niche in the phytobiome of many agriculturally important crops. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can enhance the resistance or tolerance of a plant to <i>Pratylenchus</i> and previous studies have been undertaken to investigate the relationship between these organisms. A restructuring of the AMF phylum Glomeromycota has reallocated the species into genera according to molecular analysis. A systematic review of the literature was synthesized to assess the interaction between <i>Pratylenchus</i> spp. and AMF using the revised classification. Plants inoculated with AMF generally exhibited greater tolerance as demonstrated by increased biomass under <i>Pratylenchus</i> pressure. Species of AMF from the order Diversisporales tended to increase <i>Pratylenchus</i> population densities compared to those from the order Glomerales. Species from the genera <i>Funneliformis</i> and <i>Glomus</i> had a reductive effect on <i>Pratylenchus</i> population densities. The interaction between AMF and <i>Pratylenchus</i> spp. showed variation in responses as a result of cultivar, crop species, and AMF species. Putative mechanisms involved in these interactions are discussed.

AMF: !enhances! Plant resistance to Pratylenchus
Diversisporales: !increases! Pratylenchus population densities
Funneliformis/Glomus: !reduces! Pratylenchus population densities
