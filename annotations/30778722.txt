['30778722', 'The mitochondrial metallochaperone COX19 influences iron and copper responses  highlighting a role of mitochondria in modulating metal homeostasis in  Arabidopsis. The mitochondrial copper chaperone COX19 participates in the  biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in yeast and humans. In this work, we  studied the function of COX19 in Arabidopsis thaliana, using plants with either  decreased or increased COX19 levels. A fusion of COX19 to the red fluorescent  protein localized to mitochondria in vivo, suggesting that Arabidopsis COX19 is a  mitochondrial protein. Silencing of COX19 using an artificial miRNA did not cause  changes in COX activity levels or respiration in plants grown under standard  conditions. These amiCOX19 plants, however, showed decreased expression of the  low-copper responsive miRNA gene MIR398b and an induction of the miR398 target  CSD1 relative to wild-type plants. Plants with increased COX19 levels, instead,  showed induction of MIR398b and other low-copper responsive genes. In addition,  global transcriptional changes in rosettes of amiCOX19 plants resembled those  observed under iron deficiency. Phenotypic analysis indicated that the roots of  amiCOX19 plants show altered growth responses to copper excess and iron  deficiency. COX activity levels and COX-dependent respiration were lower in  amiCOX19 plants than in wild-type plants under iron deficiency conditions,  suggesting that COX19 function is particularly important for COX assembly under  iron deficiency. The results indicate that the mitochondrial copper chaperone  COX19 has a role in regulating copper and iron homeostasis and responses in  plants.', '2019 Apr', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-019-00840-y', 'Gonzalez']
