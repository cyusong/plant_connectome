['35161268', 'Arabidopsis contains 317 genes for defensin-like (DEFL) peptides. DEFLs have been  grouped into different families based mainly on cysteine motifs. The DEFL0770  group contains seven genes, of which four are strongly expressed in roots. We  found that the expression of these genes is downregulated in syncytia induced by  the beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii as revealed by RNAseq analysis. We  have studied one gene of this group, At3g59930, in detail. A promoter::GUS line  revealed that the gene is only expressed in roots but not in other plant organs.  Infection of the GUS line with larvae of H. schachtii showed a strong  downregulation of GUS expression in infection sites as early as 1 dpi, confirming  the RNAseq data. The At3g59930 peptide had only weak antimicrobial activity  against Botrytis cinerea. Overexpression lines had no enhanced resistance against  this fungus but were more resistant to H. schachtii infection. Our data indicate  that At3g59930 is involved in resistance to nematodes which is probably not due  to direct nematicidal activity.', '2022 Jan 21', 'Plants (Basel)', '10.3390/plants11030280', 'Bohlmann']
