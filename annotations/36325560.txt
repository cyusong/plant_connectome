<i>Rhizoctonia solani Kühn</i> naturally infects and causes Sheath blight disease in cereal crops such as wheat, rice and maize, leading to severe reduction in grain yield and quality. In this work, a new bacterial strain <i>Bacillus halotolerans</i> LDFZ001 showing efficient antagonistic activity against the pathogenic strain <i>Rhizoctonia solani Kühn</i> sh-1 was isolated. Antagonistic, phylogenetic and whole genome sequencing analyses demonstrate that <i>Bacillus halotolerans</i> LDFZ001 strongly suppressed the growth of <i>Rhizoctonia solani Kühn</i> sh-1, showed a close evolutionary relationship with <i>B. halotolerans</i> F41-3, and possessed a 3,965,118 bp circular chromosome. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that the genome of <i>Bacillus halotolerans</i> LDFZ001 contained ten secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding five non-ribosomal peptide synthases, two polyketide synthase, two terpene synthases and one bacteriocin synthase, and a new kijanimicin biosynthetic gene cluster which might be responsible for the biosynthesis of novel compounds. Gene-editing experiments revealed that functional expression of phosphopantetheinyl transferase (SFP) and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter genes in <i>Bacillus halotolerans</i> LDFZ001 was essential for its antifungal activity against <i>R. solani Kühn</i> sh-1. Moreover, the existence of two identical chitosanases may also make contribution to the antipathogen activity of <i>Bacillus halotolerans</i> LDFZ001. Our findings will provide fundamental information for the identification and isolation of new sheath blight resistant genes and bacterial strains which have a great potential to be used for the production of bacterial control agents. A new <i>Bacillus halotolerans</i> strain <i>Bacillus halotolerans</i> LDFZ001 resistant to sheath blight in wheat is isolated. <i>Bacillus halotolerans</i> LDFZ001 harbors a new kijanimicin biosynthetic gene cluster, and the functional expression of <i>SFP</i> and <i>MFS</i> contribute to its antipathogen ability.
