['33107825', 'Histone modifications deposited by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) play  a critical role in the control of growth, development, and adaptation to  environmental fluctuations of most multicellular eukaryotes. The catalytic  activity of PRC2 is counteracted by Jumonji-type (JMJ) histone demethylases,  which shapes the genomic distribution of H3K27me3. Here, we show that two JMJ  histone demethylases in Arabidopsis, EARLY FLOWERING 6 (ELF6) and RELATIVE OF  EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), play distinct roles in H3K27me3 and H3K27me1  homeostasis. We show that failure to reset these chromatin marks during sexual  reproduction results in the transgenerational inheritance of histone marks, which  cause a loss of DNA methylation at heterochromatic loci and transposon  activation. Thus, Jumonji-type histone demethylases play a dual role in plants by  helping to maintain transcriptional states through development and safeguard  genome integrity during sexual reproduction.', '2020 Oct 27', 'Elife', '10.7554/eLife.58533', 'ORCID:']
