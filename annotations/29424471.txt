Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup> ) signaling has been implicated in pollen germination and pollen tube growth. To date, however, we still know very little about how exactly Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling links to various physiological subcellular processes during pollen germination and pollen tube growth. Given that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is tightly related to the cytosolic concentration and dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> , it is vital to trace the dynamic changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in order to decode Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Here, we demonstrate that G-CaMP5 serves well as an indicator for monitoring cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in pollen cells. Using this probe, we show that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes dramatically during pollen germination, and, as reported previously, Ca<sup>2+</sup> forms a tip-focused gradient in the pollen tube and undergoes oscillation in the tip region during pollen tube growth. In particular, using G-CaMP5 allowed us to capture the dynamic changes in the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> ) in pollen tubes in response to various exogenous treatments. Our data suggest that G-CaMP5 is a suitable probe for monitoring the dynamics of [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>cyt</sub> in pollen cells.
