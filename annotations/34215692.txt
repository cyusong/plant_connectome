Plant diseases are among the major causes of crop yield losses around the world. To confer disease resistance, conventional breeding relies on the deployment of single resistance (R) genes. However, this strategy has been easily overcome by constantly evolving pathogens. Disabling susceptibility (S) genes is a promising alternative to R genes in breeding programs, as it usually offers durable and broad-spectrum disease resistance. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the S gene <i>DMR6</i> (<i>AtDMR6</i>) encodes an enzyme identified as a susceptibility factor to bacterial and oomycete pathogens. Here, we present a model-to-crop translational work in which we characterize two AtDMR6 orthologs in tomato, SlDMR6-1 and SlDMR6-2. We show that <i>SlDMR6-1</i>, but not <i>SlDMR6-2</i>, is up-regulated by pathogen infection. In agreement, <i>Sldmr6-1</i> mutants display enhanced resistance against different classes of pathogens, such as bacteria, oomycete, and fungi. Notably, disease resistance correlates with increased salicylic acid (SA) levels and transcriptional activation of immune responses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SlDMR6-1 and SlDMR6-2 display SA-5 hydroxylase activity, thus contributing to the elucidation of the enzymatic function of DMR6. We then propose that SlDMR6 duplication in tomato resulted in subsequent subfunctionalization, in which SlDMR6-2 specialized in balancing SA levels in flowers/fruits, while SlDMR6-1 conserved the ability to fine-tune SA levels during pathogen infection of the plant vegetative tissues. Overall, this work not only corroborates a mechanism underlying SA homeostasis in plants, but also presents a promising strategy for engineering broad-spectrum and durable disease resistance in crops.
