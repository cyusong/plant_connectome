['36349239', 'Calcium (Ca) deficiency affects the yields and quality of agricultural products.  Susceptibility to Ca deficiency varies among crops and cultivars; however, its  genetic basis remains largely unknown. Genes required for low Ca tolerance in  Arabidopsis thaliana have been identified. In this study, we identified a novel  gene required for low Ca tolerance in A. thaliana. We isolated a mutant sensitive  to low Ca concentrations and identified Glucan synthase-like (GSL) 8 as a gene  responsible for low Ca tolerance. GSL8 is a paralog of the previously identified  low Ca tolerance gene GSL10, which encodes beta-1,3 glucan(callose) synthase. Under  low Ca conditions, the shoot growth of gsl8 mutants were inhibited compared to  wild-type plants. A grafting experiment indicated that the shoot, but not root,  genotype was important for the shoot growth phenotype. The ectopic accumulation  of callose under low Ca conditions was reduced in gsl8 mutants. We further  investigated the interaction between GSL8 and GSL10 by testing the gsl8 gsl10  double mutant for sensitivity to low Ca concentrations. The double mutant  exhibited a more severe phenotype than the single mutant under 0.3 mM Ca,  indicating additive effects of GSL8 and GSL10 with respect to low Ca tolerance.  These results establish that GSL genes are required for low Ca tolerance in A.  thaliana.', '2022 Sep 25', 'Plant Biotechnol (Tokyo)', '10.5511/plantbiotechnology.22.0421a', 'Fujiwara']
