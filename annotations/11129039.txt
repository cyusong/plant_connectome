['11129039', 'The SHL gene from Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a small nuclear protein that  contains a BAH domain and a PHD finger. Both domains are found in numerous  (putative) transcriptional regulators and chromatin-remodeling factors. Different  sets of transgenic lines were established to analyze the physiological relevance  of SHL. SHL expression driven by the CaMV 35S promoter results in reduced growth,  early flowering, early senescence, and impaired flower and seed formation.  Antisense inhibition of SHL expression gives rise to dwarfism and delayed  development. In-frame N-terminal fusion of the SHL protein to beta-glucuronidase  (GUS) directs GUS to the nucleus of stably transformed Arabidopsis plants. Thus,  SHL encodes a novel putative regulator of gene expression, which directly or  indirectly influences a broad range of developmental processes.', '2000 Nov', 'Mol Gen Genet', '10.1007/s004380000313', 'Altmann']
