['14630960', 'Plant mitochondria contain non-phosphorylating NAD(P)H dehydrogenases (DHs) that  are not found in animal mitochondria. The physiological function, substrate  specificity, and location of enzymes within this family have yet to be  conclusively determined. We have linked genome sequence information to protein  and biochemical data to identify that At1g07180 (SwissProt Q8GWA1) from the  Arabidopsis Genome Initiative database encodes AtNDI1, an internal NAD(P)H DH in  Arabidopsis mitochondria. Three lines of evidence are presented: (a). The  predicted protein sequence of AtNDI1 has high homology with other designated  NAD(P)H DHs from microorganisms, (b). the capacity for matrix NAD(P)H oxidation  via the rotenone-insensitive pathway is significantly reduced in the Atndi1  mutant plant line, and (c). the in vitro translation product of AtNDI1 is  imported into isolated mitochondria and located on the inside of the inner  membrane.', '2003 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.029363', 'Soole']
