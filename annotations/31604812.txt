The conversion of etioplasts into chloroplasts in germinating cotyledons is a crucial transition for higher plants, enabling photoautotrophic growth upon illumination. Tight coordination of chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthetic complex assembly is critical for this process. ORANGE (OR), a DnaJ-like zinc finger domain-containing protein, was reported to trigger the biogenesis of carotenoid-accumulating plastids by promoting carotenoid biosynthesis and sequestration. Both nuclear and plastidic localizations of OR have been observed. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) OR physically interacts with the transcription factor TCP14 in the nucleus and represses its transactivation activity. Through this interaction, the nucleus-localized OR negatively regulates expression of <i>EARLY LIGHT-INDUCIBLE PROTEINS</i> (<i>ELIPs</i>), reduces chlorophyll biosynthesis, and delays development of thylakoid membranes in the plastids of germinating cotyledons. Nuclear abundance of OR decreased upon illumination. Together with an accumulation of TCP14 in the nucleus, this derepresses chloroplast biogenesis during de-etiolation. <i>TCP14</i> is epistatic to <i>OR</i> and expression of <i>ELIPs</i> is directly regulated by the binding of TCP14 to <i>Up1</i> elements in the <i>ELIP</i> promoter regions. Our results demonstrate that the interaction between OR and TCP14 in the nucleus leads to repression of chloroplast biogenesis in etiolated seedlings and provide new insights into the regulation of early chloroplast development.plantcell;31/12/2996/FX1F1fx1.
