Tanshinones found in <i>Salvia</i> species are the main active compounds for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, but their contents are hugely different in different species. For example, tanshinone IIA content in <i>Salvia castanea</i> Diels f. <i>tomentosa</i> Stib. is about 49 times higher than that in <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i> Bunge. The molecular mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains largely unknown. To address this, we performed comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> and <i>S. castanea</i>. A total of 296 genes in <i>S. castanea</i> and 125 genes in <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> were highly expressed at both the transcriptional and proteome levels, including hormone signal regulation, fungus response genes, transcription factors, and CYP450. Among these differentially expressed genes, the expression of <i>SmWRKY61</i> was particularly high in <i>S. castanea</i>. Overexpression of <i>SmWRKY61</i> in <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> could significantly increase the content of tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA, which were 11.09 and 33.37 times of the control, respectively. Moreover, <i>SmWRKY61</i> had a strong regulatory effect, elevating the expression levels of tanshinone pathway genes such as <i>DXS2, CMK, HMGS2, 1, KSL1, KSL2, CYP76AH1</i>, and <i>CYP76AK3</i>. For the WRKY family, 79 <i>SmWRKY</i>s were originally obtained and classified into three main groups. Collinearity analysis indicated a more specific extension of <i>WRKY</i> gene family in <i>Salvia</i> genus. In 55 <i>Salvia</i> species, only 37 species contained the <i>WRKY61</i> sequence, and high <i>SmWRKY61</i> expression in some <i>Salvia</i> L. species was often accompanied by high tanshinone accumulation. The above results suggest that <i>SmWRKY61</i> is a highly effective regulator of tanshinone accumulation and may be a key factor resulting in high tanshinone accumulation in <i>S. castanea</i>.
