The negative effects of phosphate (Pi) and/or nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ) fertilizers on the environment have raised an urgent need to develop crop varieties with higher Pi and/or nitrogen use efficiencies for cultivation in low-fertility soils. Achieving this goal depends upon research that focuses on the identification of genes involved in plant responses to Pi and/or NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> starvation. Although plant responses to individual deficiency in either Pi (-Pi/+NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ) or NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (+Pi/-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ) have been separately studied, our understanding of plant responses to combined Pi and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deficiency (-Pi/-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ) is still very limited. Using RNA-sequencing approach, transcriptome changes in the roots and leaves of chickpea cultivated under -Pi/+NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> , +Pi/-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or -Pi/-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> conditions were investigated in a comparative manner. -Pi/-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatment displayed lesser effect on expression changes of genes related to Pi or NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport, signalling networks, lipid remodelling, nitrogen and Pi scavenging/remobilization/recycling, carbon metabolism and hormone metabolism than -Pi/+NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or +Pi/-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments. Therefore, the plant response to -Pi/-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is not simply an additive result of plant responses to -Pi/+NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and +Pi/-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments. Our results indicate that nutrient imbalance is a stronger stimulus for molecular reprogramming than an overall deficiency.
