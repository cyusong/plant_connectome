Understanding peroxidase function in plants is difficult because of the lack of substrate specificity, the high number of genes and their diversity in structure. In the present study, the relative expression of 22 genes coding putative peroxidases (E.C 1.11.1.x) in Arabidopsis was studied. The relative expression of AtPrx37 showed a correlation with the cessation of growth in rosette leaves as well as with the growth capacity along the flower stem. Using AtPrx37::GUS construction, its expression was associated with the vascular bundles. Furthermore, the overexpression of AtPrx37 under the control of CaMV 35S promoter rendered a dwarf phenotype with smaller plants and delayed development. The plants overexpressing AtPrx37 also showed an increase in the amount of esterified phenolic material associated with their walls. A role in the growth cessation and phenolic cross-linking during lignin deposition is postulated.
