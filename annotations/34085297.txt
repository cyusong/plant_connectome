Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form mutualisms with most plant species. The model AMF Rhizophagus irregularis is common in many ecosystems and naturally forms homokaryons and dikaryons. Quantitative variation in allele frequencies in clonally dikaryon offspring suggests they disproportionately inherit two distinct nuclear genotypes from their parent. This is interesting, because such progeny strongly and differentially affect plant growth. Neither the frequency and magnitude of this occurrence nor its effect on gene transcription are known. Using reduced representation genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and quantitative analysis tools, we show that progeny of homokaryons and dikaryons are qualitatively genetically identical to the parent. However, dikaryon progeny differ quantitatively due to unequal inheritance of nuclear genotypes. Allele frequencies of actively transcribed biallelic genes resembled the frequencies of the two nuclear genotypes. More biallelic genes showed transcription of both alleles than monoallelic transcription, but biallelic transcription was less likely with greater allelic divergence. Monoallelic transcription levels of biallelic genes were reduced compared with biallelic gene transcription, a finding consistent with genomic conflict. Given that genetic variation in R. irregularis is associated with plant growth, our results establish quantitative genetic variation as a future consideration when selecting AMF lines to improve plant production.
