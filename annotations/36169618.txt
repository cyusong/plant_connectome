Phytohormones are major signaling components that contribute to nearly all aspects of plant life. They constitute an interconnected communication network to fine-tune growth and development in response to the ever-changing environment. To this end, they have to coordinate with other signaling components, such as reactive oxygen species and calcium signals. On the one hand, the two endosymbiotic organelles, plastids and mitochondria, control various aspects of phytohormone signaling and harbor important steps of hormone precursor biosynthesis. On the other hand, phytohormones have feedback actions on organellar functions. In addition, organelles and phytohormones often act in parallel in a coordinated matter to regulate cellular functions. Therefore, linking organelle functions with increasing knowledge of phytohormone biosynthesis, perception, and signaling will reveal new aspects of plant stress tolerance. In this review, we highlight recent work on organelle-phytohormone interactions focusing on the major stress-related hormones abscisic acid, jasmonates, salicylic acid, and ethylene.
