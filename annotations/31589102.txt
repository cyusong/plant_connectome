Salt stress adversely affects plant growth and development. Multiple adaptive mechanisms have been used for plant salt tolerance. We previously reported that membrane trafficking-related protein patellin1 (PATL1) negatively regulates plant salt tolerance. Here, we characterized that Arabidopsis PATL1 negatively modulates nitric oxide (NO) accumulation upon salt exposure. Our work revealed a functional link between salt response and NO signaling.

PATL1: !negatively regulates! salt tolerance
PATL1: !modulates! NO accumulation
Salt response: !linked to! NO signaling
