Anthocyanins are responsible pigments for giving attractive colors of plant organs and nutraceutical benefits of grains. Anthocyanin biosynthesis is known to be regulated by transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the R2R3 MYB transcription factor (TF) OsC1 and a bHLH TF, OsB2, were previously reported to control anthocyanin biosynthesis in vegetative tissues and seeds, respectively; however, the regulatory mechanisms of the anthocyanin biosynthesis by TFs remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified OsBBX14, a homolog of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> B-box domain protein 22 (AtBBX22), and investigated its function. The transcript level of <i>OsBBX14</i> was high in pigmented rice seeds and gradually increased as the seeds matured. The ectopic expression of <i>OsBBX14</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> resulted in a dramatic increase in anthocyanin accumulation in its seedlings. Using a steroid receptor-based inducible activation system, OsBBX14 and OsHY5 were found to directly activate <i>OsC1</i> or <i>OsB2</i> in an independent or collaborative manner. Yeast two hybrid revealed that the second B-box domain of OsBBX14 physically interacts with the bZIP domain of OsHY5. These results suggest that the anthocyanin biosynthesis in rice is induced and finely tuned by OsBBX14 in collaboration with OsHY5.
