The AP2/ERF transcription factors are widely involved in the regulation of plant growth, development and stress responses. <i>Arabidopsis ERF012</i> is differentially responsive to various stresses; however, its potential regulatory role remains elusive. Here, we show that <i>ERF012</i> is predominantly expressed in the vascular bundles, lateral root primordium and vein branch points. <i>ERF012</i> overexpression inhibits root growth, whereas it promotes root hair development and leaf senescence. In particular, <i>ERF012</i> may downregulate its target genes <i>AtC4H</i> and <i>At4CL1</i>, key players in phenylpropanoid metabolism and cell wall formation, to hinder auxin accumulation and thereby impacting root growth and leaf senescence. Consistent with this, exogenous IAA application effectively relieves the effect of <i>ERF012</i> overexpression on root growth and leaf senescence. Meanwhile, <i>ERF012</i> presumably activates ethylene biosynthesis to promote root hair development, considering that the <i>ERF012</i>-mediated root hair development can be suppressed by the ethylene biosynthetic inhibitor. In addition, <i>ERF012</i> overexpression displays positive and negative effects on low- and high-temperature responses, respectively, while conferring plant resistance to drought, salinity and heavy metal stresses. Taken together, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the functional versatility of <i>ERF012</i> in plant growth, development and abiotic stress responses.
