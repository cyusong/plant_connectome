A grapevine model system is described that is suitable for rapid forward and reverse genetic studies in small controlled environments. It is based on the Vvgai1 mutant allele that confers a dwarf stature, short generation cycles and continuous flowering ('microvine'). Black and white berry microvine genotypes were developed that can be transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Near-homozygous lines were created for efficient bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker mapping and mutagenesis studies. A genetic mapping strategy based on picovine-derived microvine progeny populations was used to rapidly phenotype and map the flower sex and fleshless berry loci and identify a new lethal recessive locus, Vvlrl1. The microvine provides a unique model system for rapid genetic studies of grapevine by changing the perennial long life cycle of the plant to one with features and advantages similar to an annual plant.

Vvgai1: !confers! dwarf stature
Vvgai1: !shortens! generation cycles
Agrobacterium tumefaciens: !transforms! microvine genotypes
SNP marker mapping: !identifies! Vvlrl1 locus
microvine: !provides! unique model system
grapevine: !changes! long life cycle
