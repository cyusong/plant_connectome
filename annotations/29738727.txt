The grasses have been extremely successful in colonizing a wide range of terrestrial habitats, partially due to the unique physiology of their stomatal complexes. A new study has added new insight into the regulation of cereal stomata in showing that they are sensitive to nitrate concentration, and how a specific anion channel is responsible for this sensitivity.
