['22188168', 'Arabidopsis possesses two arginase-encoding genes, ARGAH1 and ARGAH2, catalysing  the catabolism of arginine into ornithine and urea. Arginine and ornithine are  both precursors for polyamine biosynthetic pathways. We observed an accumulation  of ARGAH2 mRNA in Arabidopsis upon inoculation with the necrotrophic pathogen  Botrytis cinerea. Transgenic lines displaying either overexpression of ARGAH2 or  simultaneous silencing of both Arabidopsis arginase-encoding genes were created  and their resistance to B. cinerea infection evaluated. Overexpression of  arginase resulted in changes in amino acid accumulation, while polyamine levels  remained largely unaffected. Silencing lines were affected in both amino acid and  putrescine accumulation. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the arginase gene were  less susceptible to B. cinerea, whereas silencing lines remained as susceptible  as the wild type. We discuss how arginase might interact with plant defence  mechanisms. These results provide new insights into amino acid metabolic changes  under stress.', '2012 Mar', 'Plant Biol (Stuttg)', '10.1111/j.1438-8677.2011.00520.x', 'Angenon']
