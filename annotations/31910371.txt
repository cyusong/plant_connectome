How do perennial plants adapt their growth to seasonal changes? A new study in the hybrid aspen reveals that, in short days, repression of a growth-promoting genetic pathway leads to upregulation of the BRANCHED1 genes, which in turn induce growth cessation.

Gene: !represses! Growth-promoting pathway 
BRANCHED1 genes: !induces! Growth cessation 
Gene: !upregulates! BRANCHED1 genes
