['19109414', 'The reduction and the formation of regulatory disulfide bonds serve as a key  signaling element in chloroplasts. Members of the thioredoxin (Trx) superfamily  of oxidoreductases play a major role in these processes. We have characterized a  small family of plant-specific Trxs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that  are rich in cysteine and histidine residues and are typified by a variable  noncanonical redox active site. We found that the redox midpoint potential of  three selected family members is significantly less reducing than that of the  classic Trxs. Assays of subcellular localization demonstrated that all proteins  are localized to the chloroplast. Selected members showed high activity,  contingent on a dithiol electron donor, toward the chloroplast 2-cysteine  peroxiredoxin A and poor activity toward the chloroplast NADP-malate  dehydrogenase. The expression profile of the family members suggests that they  have distinct roles. The intermediate redox midpoint potential value of the  atypical Trxs might imply adaptability to function in modulating the redox state  of chloroplast proteins with regulatory disulfides.', '2009 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.128314', 'Danon']
