Plant cell wall polysaccharides, including xylan, glucomannan, xyloglucan and pectin, are often acetylated. Although a number of acetyltransferases responsible for the acetylation of some of these polysaccharides have been biochemically characterized, little is known about the source of acetyl donors and how acetyl donors are translocated into the Golgi, where these polysaccharides are synthesized. In this report, we investigated roles of ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) that generates cytosolic acetyl-CoA in cell wall polysaccharide acetylation and effects of simultaneous mutations of four Reduced Wall Acetylation (RWA) genes on acetyl-CoA transport into the Golgi in Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression analyses of genes involved in the generation of acetyl-CoA in different subcellular compartments showed that the expression of several ACL genes responsible for cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis was elevated in interfascicular fiber cells and induced by secondary wall-associated transcriptional activators. Simultaneous downregulation of the expression of ACL genes was demonstrated to result in a substantial decrease in the degree of xylan acetylation and a severe alteration in secondary wall structure in xylem vessels. In addition, the degree of acetylation of other cell wall polysaccharides, including glucomannan, xyloglucan and pectin, was also reduced. Moreover, Golgi-enriched membrane vesicles isolated from the rwa1/2/3/4 quadruple mutant were found to exhibit a drastic reduction in acetyl-CoA transport activity compared with the wild type. These findings indicate that cytosolic acetyl-CoA generated by ACL is essential for cell wall polysaccharide acetylation and RWAs are required for its transport from the cytosol into the Golgi.
