['17251269', 'In plants, the arrangement of organs along the stem (phyllotaxy) follows a  predictable pattern. Recent studies have shown that primordium position at the  meristem is governed by local auxin gradients, but little is known about the  subsequent events leading to the phyllotaxy along the mature stem. We show here  that plants expressing a miR164-resistant CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) gene have  an abnormal phyllotactic pattern in the fully grown stem, despite the pattern of  organ initiation by the meristem being normal. This implies that abnormal  phyllotaxy is generated during stem growth. These plants ectopically express CUC2  in the stem, suggesting that the proper timing of CUC2 expression is required to  maintain the pattern initiated in the meristem. Furthermore, by carefully  comparing the phyllotaxy in the meristem and along the mature inflorescence in  wild types, we show that such deviation also occurs during wild-type development,  although to a smaller extent. We therefore suggest that the phyllotactic pattern  in a fully grown stem results not only from the organogenetic activity of the  meristem, but also from the subsequent growth pattern during stem development.', '2007 Mar', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.02774', 'Laufs']
