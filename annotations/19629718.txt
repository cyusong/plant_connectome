Elsholtzia splendens is generally considered as a Cu-tolerant and -accumulating plant species, and a candidate for phytoremediation of Cu-contaminated soils. To better understand the Cu tolerance/accumulation mechanisms in E. splendens, proteomic analysis was performed on E. splendens roots and leaves exposed to 100 muM CuSO(4) for 3 and 6 days. After 6 days of treatment, Cu accumulation in roots increased much more than that in leaves. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the proteins changed more intensively in roots than did in leaves upon Cu stress. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and image analyses found that 45 protein spots were significantly changed in roots, but only six protein spots in leaves. The abundance of protein spots mostly showed temporal changes. MALDI-TOF MS and LTQ-ESI-MS/MS were used to identify the differently expressed protein spots. The identified root proteins were involved in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, regulation of transcription and translation, energy metabolism, regulation of redox homeostasis and cell defense. The leaf proteins were mainly degraded fragments of RuBisCo and antioxidative protein. The roles of these proteins in Cu tolerance/accumulation were discussed. The resulting differences in protein expression pattern suggested that redirection of root cellular metabolism and redox homeostasis might be important survival mechanisms of E. splendens upon Cu stress.
