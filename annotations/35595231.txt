Systemic acquired acclimation and wound signaling require the transmission of electrical, calcium, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals between local and systemic tissues of the same plant. However, whether such signals can be transmitted between two different plants is largely unknown. Here, we reveal a new type of plant-to-plant aboveground direct communication involving electrical signaling detected at the surface of leaves, ROS, and photosystem networks. A foliar electrical signal induced by wounding or high light stress applied to a single dandelion leaf can be transmitted to a neighboring plant that is in direct contact with the stimulated plant, resulting in systemic photosynthetic, oxidative, molecular, and physiological changes in both plants. Furthermore, similar aboveground changes can be induced in a network of plants serially connected via touch. Such signals can also induce responses even if the neighboring plant is from a different plant species. Our study demonstrates that electrical signals can function as a communication link between transmitter and receiver plants that are organized as a network (community) of plants. This process can be described as network-acquired acclimation.
