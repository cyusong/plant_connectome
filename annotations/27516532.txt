Plastid intramembrane proteases in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) are involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis, chloroplast development, and flower morphology. Here, we show that Ammonium-Overly-Sensitive1 (AMOS1), a member of the family of plastid intramembrane proteases, plays an important role in the maintenance of phosphate (P) homeostasis under P stress. Loss of function of AMOS1 revealed a striking resistance to P starvation. amos1 plants displayed retarded root growth and reduced P accumulation in the root compared to wild type (Col-0) under P-replete control conditions, but remained largely unaffected by P starvation, displaying comparable P accumulation and root and shoot growth under P-deficient conditions. Further analysis revealed that, under P-deficient conditions, the cell wall, especially the pectin fraction of amos1, released more P than that of wild type, accompanied by a reduction of the abscisic acid (ABA) level and an increase in ethylene production. By using an ABA-insensitive mutant, abi4, and applying ABA and ACC exogenously, we found that ABA inhibits cell wall P remobilization while ethylene facilitates P remobilization from the cell wall by increasing the pectin concentration, suggesting ABA can counteract the effect of ethylene. Furthermore, the elevated ABA level and the lower ethylene production also correlated well with the mimicked P deficiency in amos1 Thus, our study uncovers the role of AMOS1 in the maintenance of P homeostasis through ABA-antagonized ethylene signaling.
