<i>SAC</i> genes have been identified to play a variety of biological functions and responses to various stresses. Previously, <i>SAC</i> genes have been recognized in animals and <i>Arabidopsis</i>. For the very first time, we identified 157 <i>SAC</i> genes in eight cotton species including three diploids and five tetraploids with 23 <i>SAC</i> members in <i>G. hirsutum</i>. Evolutionary analysis classified all cotton <i>SAC</i> gene family members into five distinct groups. Cotton <i>SAC</i> genes showed conserved sequence logos and WGD or segmental duplication. Multiple synteny and collinearity analyses revealed gene family expansion and purifying selection pressure during evolution. <i>G. hirsutum SAC</i> genes showed uneven chromosomal distribution, multiple exons/introns, conserved protein motifs, and various growth and stress-related <i>cis</i>-elements. Expression pattern analysis revealed three <i>GhSAC</i> genes (<i>GhSAC3</i>, <i>GhSAC14</i>, and <i>GhSAC20</i>) preferentially expressed in flower, five genes (<i>GhSAC1</i>, <i>GhSAC6</i>, <i>GhSAC9</i>, <i>GhSAC13</i>, and <i>GhSAC18</i>) preferentially expressed in ovule and one gene (<i>GhSAC5</i>) preferentially expressed in fiber. Similarly, abiotic stress treatment verified that <i>GhSAC5</i> was downregulated under all stresses, <i>GhSAC6</i> and <i>GhSAC9</i> were upregulated under NaCl treatment, and <i>GhSAC9</i> and <i>GhSAC18</i> were upregulated under PEG and heat treatment respectively. Overall, this study identified key genes related to flower, ovule, and fiber development and important genetic material for breeding cotton under abiotic stress conditions.
