Alkaloids are, in some plant species, transported from the source organ after their biosynthesis and moved to sink organs via long distance transport. One representative is nicotine, which is biosynthesized in roots, then translocated to the leaves, and finally accumulated in the leaf vacuoles in <i>Nicotiana</i> species. Although the nicotine translocation was identified more than 10 years ago, no transport protein has been characterized concerning the inter-organ movement of this alkaloid. We characterized a novel multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE)-type transporter, Nt-JAT1 (<i><u>N</u>icotiana <u>t</u>abacum</i> <u>j</u>asmonate-inducible <u>a</u>lkaloid <u>t</u>ransporter 1). <i>Nt-JAT1</i> was co-regulated with biosynthetic genes following methyl jasmonate treatment. This MATE gene was expressed in the leaves, stems, and roots in tobacco plants. Biochemical analyses suggested that Nt-JAT1 transported nicotine. The location of Nt-JAT1 was shown to be the tonoplast. These data suggested that Nt-JAT1 plays an important role in the nicotine translocation by acting as a transporter responsible for the unloading of nicotine in the aerial parts of the plant and its deposition in the vacuoles (Fig. 1). To our knowledge, this is the first identification of a vacuolar transporter for alkaloids in plant. A possible application of this transporter for the production of valuable alkaloids is also discussed.
