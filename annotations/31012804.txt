The plasma membrane (PM) is at the interface of plant-pathogen interactions and, thus, many bacterial type-III effector (T3E) proteins target membrane-associated processes to interfere with immunity. The <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> T3E HopZ1a is a host cell PM-localized effector protein that has several immunity-associated host targets but also activates effector-triggered immunity in resistant backgrounds. Although HopZ1a has been shown to interfere with early defense signaling at the PM, no dedicated PM-associated HopZ1a target protein has been identified until now. Here, we show that HopZ1a interacts with the PM-associated remorin protein NbREM4 from <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> in several independent assays. NbREM4 relocalizes to membrane nanodomains after treatment with the bacterial elicitor flg22 and transient overexpression of NbREM4 in <i>N. benthamiana</i> induces the expression of a subset of defense-related genes. We can further show that NbREM4 interacts with the immune-related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase avrPphB-susceptible 1 (PBS1) and is phosphorylated by PBS1 on several residues in vitro. Thus, we conclude that NbREM4 is associated with early defense signaling at the PM. The possible relevance of the HopZ1a-NbREM4 interaction for HopZ1a virulence and avirulence functions is discussed.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).
