Melatonin, a molecule that was first identified in animal tissues, has been confirmed to be involved as a potential phytohormone in a variety of plant physiological responses. It is considered primarily as an antioxidant with important actions in controlling reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species. In addition to its role in regulating plant growth and development, phytomelatonin is involved in protection against abiotic and biotic stresses. The 'gasotransmitter'-that is, a gaseous signaling molecule-is a new concept that has been advanced in the past two decades, with functions in animal and plant physiological regulation. Gasotransmitters including nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, and, more recently identified, hydrogen gas are critical and indispensable in a wide range of biological processes. This review investigates the interrelationship between phytomelatonin and the above-mentioned gasotransmitters from the perspective of biosynthetic origin and functions. Moreover, the potential future research directions for phytomelatonin and gasotransmitters interactions are discussed.
