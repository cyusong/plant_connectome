It has previously been shown that the nucleotide sequences of the Agrobacterium rhizogenes rolC locus and the selective marker nptII developed mutations during the long-term cultivation of transgenic cell cultures of Panax ginseng. In the present report, we analyzed the nucleotide sequences of selected plant gene families in the 20-year-old P. ginseng 1c cell culture and in leaves of cultivated P. ginseng plants. We sequenced the Actin genes, which are a family of house-keeping genes; the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and dammarenediol synthase genes (DDS), which actively participate in the biosynthesis of ginsenosides; and the somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase (SERK) genes, which control plant development. We demonstrate that the plant genes also developed mutations during long-term cultivation. The highest level of nucleotide substitution was detected in the sequences of the SERK genes (2.00±0.11 nt per 1000 nt), and the level was significantly higher when compared with the cultivated P. ginseng plant. Interestingly, while the diversity of Actin genes was similar in the P. ginseng cell culture and the cultivated plants, the diversity of the DDS and SERK genes was less in the 20-year-old cell culture than in the cultivated plants. In this work, we detail the level of nucleotide substitutions in different plant genes during the long-term culture of plant cells.

Actin: !similar in! P. ginseng cell culture and cultivated plants
PAL: !actively participates in! biosynthesis of ginsenosides
DDS: !less in! 20-year-old cell culture than cultivated plants
SERK: !controls! plant development
SERK: !highest level of nucleotide substitution in! P. ginseng cell culture
