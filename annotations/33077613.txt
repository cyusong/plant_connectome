The meiotic TopoVI B subunit (MTopVIB) plays an essential role in double-strand break formation in mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>), Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), and recent work reveals that rice <i>MTopVIB</i> also plays an unexpected role in meiotic bipolar spindle assembly, highlighting multiple functions of <i>MTopVIB</i> during rice meiosis. In this work, we characterized the meiotic <i>TopVIB</i> in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>; <i>ZmMTOPVIB</i>). The <i>ZmmtopVIB</i> mutant plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but male and female sterility. Meiotic double-strand break formation was abolished in mutant meiocytes. Despite normal assembly of axial elements, mutants showed severely affected synapsis and disrupted homologous pairing. Importantly, we showed that bipolar spindle assembly was also affected in <i>ZmmtopVIB</i>, resulting in triad and polyad formation. Overall, our results demonstrate that <i>ZmMTOPVIB</i> plays critical roles in double-strand break formation and homologous recombination. In addition, our results suggest that the function of <i>MTOPVIB</i> in bipolar spindle assembly is likely conserved across different monocots.
