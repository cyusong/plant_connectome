A comparative analysis of the genus Flaveria showed a C<sub>4</sub> evolutionary process in which the anatomical and metabolic features of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis were gradually acquired through C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate stages. C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis has been acquired in multiple lineages of angiosperms during evolution to suppress photorespiration. Crops that perform C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis exhibit high rates of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and high grain production even under high-temperature in semiarid environments; therefore, engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in C<sub>3</sub> plants is of great importance in the application field. The genus Flaveria contains a large number of C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate, C<sub>4</sub>-like, and C<sub>4</sub> species, making it a good model genus to study the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, and these studies indicate the direction for C<sub>4</sub> engineering. C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis was acquired gradually through the C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate stage. First, a two-celled C<sub>2</sub> cycle called C<sub>2</sub> photosynthesis was acquired by localizing glycine decarboxylase activity in the mitochondria of bundle sheath cells. With the development of two-cell metabolism, anatomical features also changed. Next, the replacement of the two-celled C<sub>2</sub> cycle by the two-celled C<sub>4</sub> cycle was induced by the acquisition of cell-selective expression in addition to the upregulation of enzymes in the C<sub>4</sub> cycle during the C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate stage. This was supported by an increase in cyclic electron transport activity in response to an increase in the ATP/NADPH demand for metabolism. Suppression of the C<sub>3</sub> cycle in mesophyll cells was induced after the functional establishment of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle, and optimization of electron transport by suppressing the activity of photosystem II also occurred during the final phase of C<sub>4</sub> evolution.
