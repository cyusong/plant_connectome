Use of the morphogenic genes <i>Baby Boom</i> (<i>Bbm</i>) and <i>Wuschel2</i> (<i>Wus2</i>), along with new ternary constructs, has increased the genotype range and the type of explants that can be used for maize transformation. Further optimizing the expression pattern for <i>Bbm</i>/<i>Wus2</i> has resulted in rapid maize transformation methods that are faster and applicable to a broader range of inbreds. However, expression of <i>Bbm</i>/<i>Wus2</i> can compromise the quality of regenerated plants, leading to sterility. We reasoned excising morphogenic genes after transformation but before regeneration would increase production of fertile T0 plants. We developed a method that uses an inducible site-specific recombinase (<i>Cre</i>) to excise morphogenic genes. The use of developmentally regulated promoters, such as <i>Ole</i>, <i>Glb1</i>, <i>End2</i>, and <i>Ltp2</i>, to drive <i>Cre</i> enabled excision of morphogenic genes in early embryo development and produced excised events at a rate of 25-100%. A different strategy utilizing an excision-activated selectable marker produced excised events at a rate of 53-68%; however, the transformation frequency was lower (13-50%). The use of inducible heat shock promoters (e.g. <i>Hsp17.7</i>, <i>Hsp26</i>) to express Cre, along with improvements in tissue culture conditions and construct design, resulted in high frequencies of T0 transformation (29-69%), excision (50-97%), usable quality events (4-15%), and few escapes (non-transgenic; 14-17%) in three elite maize inbreds. Transgenic events produced by this method are free of morphogenic and marker genes.
