Our previous study indicates that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is involved in plant immunity. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, a genetic screening assay was carried out to identify suppressors of type one protein phosphatase 4 mutation (topp4-1) (sut). Molecular and genetic approaches were used to investigate the mechanism of activation of autoimmune response in topp4-1. We performed a map-based cloning assay to identify the SUT1 gene, which encodes a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich-repeat (NB-LRR) protein (CNL). SUT1 physically interacts with TYPE ONE PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 4 (TOPP4) and topp4-1. The mutated topp4-1 protein activates the autoimmune response in the cytoplasm and promotes the accumulation of SUT1 at both the transcription and the protein levels. Furthermore, our genetic and physical interactions confirm that the topp4-1-induced autoimmune responses are probably mediated by HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 90 (HSP90) and REQUIRED FOR MLA12 RESISTANCE 1 (RAR1). This study reveals that TOPP4 phosphatase is likely guarded by SUT1 in plant immunity.
