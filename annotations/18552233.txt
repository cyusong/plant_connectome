['18552233', 'The acs1 knockout mutant that has a disruption in the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A  (CoA) synthetase (ACS; At5g36880) gene was used to explore the role of this  protein and plastidic acetate metabolism in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).  Disruption of the ACS gene decreased ACS activity by 90% and largely blocked the  incorporation of exogenous (14)C-acetate and (14)C-ethanol into fatty acids.  Whereas the disruption had no significant effect on the synthesis of bulk seed  triacylglycerols, the acs1 plants were smaller and flowered later. This suggests  that the pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass provided by the aerobic fermentation  pathway that converts pyruvate to acetate and probably on to fatty acids is  important to the plants during normal growth. The role of ACS in destroying  fermentative intermediates is supported by the increased sensitivity of the acs1  mutant to exogenous acetate, ethanol, and acetaldehyde compared to wild-type  plants. Whereas these observations suggest that flux through the aerobic  fermentation pathway is important, the reason for this flux is unclear.  Interestingly, acetate is able to support high rates of plant growth on medium  and this growth is blocked in the acs1 mutant.', '2008 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.121269', 'Oliver']
