Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub) is being recognized as a regulatory mechanism that controls a range of cellular processes in plants, but the molecular mechanisms of H2Bub that are involved in responses to biotic stress are largely unknown. In this study, we used wild-type and H2Bub loss-of-function mutations of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to elucidate which of its mechanisms are involved in the regulation of the plant's defense response to Verticillium dahliae (Vd) toxins. We demonstrate that the depolymerization of the cortical microtubules (MTs) was different in the wild type and the mutants in the response to Vd toxins. The loss-of-function alleles of HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION1 and HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION2 mutations present a weaker depolymerization of the MTs, and protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation of the dynamics of MTs. Moreover, H2Bub is a positive regulator of the gene expression of protein tyrosine phosphatases. These findings provide direct evidence for H2Bub as an important modification with regulatory roles in the defense against Vd toxins and demonstrate that H2Bub is involved in modulating the dynamics of MTs, likely through the protein tyrosine phosphatase-mediated signaling pathway.
