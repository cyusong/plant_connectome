Photosynthetic organisms use sunlight as the primary energy source to fix CO<sub>2</sub> . However, in nature, light energy is highly variable, reaching levels of saturation for periods ranging from milliseconds to hours. In the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, safe dissipation of excess light energy by nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) is mediated by light-harvesting complex stress-related (LHCSR) proteins and redistribution of light-harvesting antennae between the photosystems (state transition). Although each component underlying NPQ has been documented, their relative contributions to NPQ under fluctuating light conditions remain unknown. Here, by monitoring NPQ in intact cells throughout high light/dark cycles of various illumination periods, we find that the dynamics of NPQ depend on the timescales of light fluctuations. We show that LHCSRs play a major role during the light phases of light fluctuations and describe their role in growth under rapid light fluctuations. We further reveal an activation of NPQ during the dark phases of all high light/dark cycles and show that this phenomenon arises from state transition. Finally, we show that LHCSRs and state transition synergistically cooperate to enable NPQ response during light fluctuations. These results highlight the dynamic functioning of photoprotection under light fluctuations and open a new way to systematically characterize the photosynthetic response to an ever-changing light environment.
