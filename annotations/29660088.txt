Maturing seeds stimulate fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis and triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation to ensure carbon and energy reserves. Transcriptional reprogramming is a key regulatory scheme in seed oil accumulation. In particular, TAG assembly is mainly controlled by the transcriptional regulation of two key enzymes, acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) and phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (PDAT1), in Arabidopsis seeds. However, the transcriptional regulators of these enzymes are as yet unknown. Here, we report that the R2R3-type MYB96 transcription factor regulates seed oil accumulation by activating the genes encoding DGAT1 and PDAT1, the rate-limiting enzymes of the last step of TAG assembly. Total FA levels are significantly elevated in MYB96-overexpressing transgenic seeds, but reduced in MYB96-deficient mutant seeds. Notably, MYB96 regulation of TAG accumulation is independent of WRINKLED 1 (WRI1)-mediated FA biosynthesis. Taken together, our findings indicate that FA biosynthesis and TAG accumulation are under independent transcriptional control, and MYB96 is mainly responsible for TAG assembly in seeds.
