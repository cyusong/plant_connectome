['30238536', "Pattern recognition receptors (PRR) and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat  proteins (NLR) are major components of the plant immune system responsible for  pathogen detection. To date, the transcriptional regulation of PRR/NLR genes is  poorly understood. Some PRR/NLR genes are affected by epigenetic changes of  neighboring transposable elements (TEs) (cis regulation). We analyzed whether  these genes can also respond to changes in the epigenetic marks of distal  pericentromeric TEs (trans regulation). We found that Arabidopsis tissues  infected with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) initially induced the  expression of pericentromeric TEs, and then repressed it by RNA-directed DNA  methylation (RdDM). The latter response was accompanied by the accumulation of  small RNAs (sRNAs) mapping to the TEs. Curiously these sRNAs also mapped to  distal PRR/NLR genes, which were controlled by RdDM but remained induced in the  infected tissues. Then, we used non-infected mom1 (Morpheus' molecule 1) mutants  that expressed pericentromeric TEs to test if they lose repression of PRR/NLR  genes. mom1 plants activated several PRR/NLR genes that were unlinked to  MOM1-targeted TEs, and showed enhanced resistance to Pst. Remarkably, the  increased defenses of mom1 were abolished when MOM1/RdDM-mediated pericentromeric  TEs silencing was re-established. Therefore, common sRNAs could control PRR/NLR  genes and distal pericentromeric TEs and preferentially silence TEs when they are  activated.", '2018 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14098', 'ORCID:']
