mRNA translation is the growth rate-limiting step in genome expression. Target of rapamycin (TOR) evolved a central regulatory role in eukaryotes as a signaling hub that monitors nutrient availability to maintain homeostasis and promote growth, largely by increasing the rate of translation initiation and protein synthesis. The dynamic pathways engaged by TOR to regulate translation remain debated even in well-studied yeast and mammalian models, however, despite decades of intense investigation. Recent studies have firmly established that TOR also regulates mRNA translation in plants through conserved mechanisms, such as the TOR-LARP1-5'TOP signaling axis, and through pathways specific to plants. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of mRNA translation in plants by TOR.

TOR: !regulates! mRNA translation
TOR: !monitors! nutrient availability
TOR: !increases! rate of translation initiation
TOR: !engages! dynamic pathways
TOR: !regulates! translation through conserved mechanisms
TOR: !regulates! translation through pathways specific to plants
