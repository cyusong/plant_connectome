Recent reports of acetic acid-induced drought tolerance and avoidance across a diverse range of plant species encourage consideration of this low-cost commodity organic acid as a biostimulant. These results are surprising as they contrast with earlier studies showing pH-dependent root growth inhibition at similar concentrations. We test the hypothesis that the concentration of the membrane permeable undissociated form of acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) selectively inhibits maize root growth, and subsequently evaluate its impact on seedling water use and growth under deficit irrigation. We demonstrate conclusively for the first time that when germinating maize on filter paper, low pH exacerbates, and high pH mitigates, this inhibition of root growth in a predictable manner based on the dissociation constant of acetic acid. The buffering capacity of potting media can reduce this root damage through keeping the acetic acid primarily in the membrane impermeable dissociated form (CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>) at near neutral pH, but peat substrates appear to offer some protection, even at low pH. While both deficit irrigation and acetic acid reduced water use and growth of maize seedlings outdoors, there was no significant interaction between the treatments. Twenty nine millimolar total acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>) reduced transpiration, compared to lower and higher concentrations, but this did not specifically improve performance under reduced water availability, with parallel declines in shoot biomass leading to relatively consistent water use efficiency. Any acetic acid biostimulant claims under water stress should characterize its dissociation level, and exclude root damage as a primary cause.
