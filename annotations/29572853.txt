Plant and algal cell walls are complex biomaterials composed of stiff cellulose microfibrils embedded in a soft matrix of polysaccharides, proteins and phenolic compounds. Cell wall composition differs between taxonomic groups and different tissue types (or even at the sub-cellular level) within a plant enabling specific biomechanical properties important for cell/tissue function. Moreover, cell wall composition changes may be induced in response to environmental conditions. Plant structure, habit, morphology and internal anatomy are also dependent on the taxonomic group as well as abiotic and biotic factors. This review aims to examine the complex and incompletely understood interactions of cell wall composition, plant form and biomechanical function.
