Hemerocallis citrina Baroni (daylily) is a horticultural ornamental plant and vegetable with various applications as a raw material in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavouring agent. Daylily contains many functional substances and is rich in lecithin, which is mostly composed of glycerophospholipids. To study the comprehensive dynamic changes in glycerophospholipid during daylily flowering and the underlying signalling mechanisms, we performed comprehensive, time-resolved lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses of 'Datong Huanghua 6' daylily. Labelling with PKH67 fluorescent antibodies clearly and effectively helped visualise lipid changes in daylily, while relative conductivity and malonaldehyde content detection revealed that the early stages of flowering were controllable processes; however, differences became non-significant after 18 h, indicating cellular damage. In addition, phospholipase D (PLD) and lipoxygenase (LOX) activities increased throughout the flowering process, suggesting that lipid hydrolysis and oxidation had intensified. Lipidomics identified 558 lipids that changed during flowering, with the most different lipids found 12 h before and 12 h after flowering. Transcriptome analysis identified 13 key functional genes and enzymes in the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway. The two-way orthogonal partial least squares analysis showed that diacylglycerol diphosphate phosphatase correlated strongly and positively with phosphatidic acid (PA)(22:0/18:2), PA(34:2), PA(34:4), and diacylglycerol(18:2/21:0) but negatively with phospholipase C. In addition, ethanolamine phosphotransferase gene and phospholipid-N-methyltransferase gene correlated positively with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)(16:0/18:2), PE(16:0/18:3), PE(33:2), and lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0) but negatively with PE(34:1). Overall, this study elucidated changes in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway during the daylily flowering process, as well as characteristic genes, thus providing a basis for future studies of glycerophospholipids and signal transduction in daylilies.
