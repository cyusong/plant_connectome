The transgenic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> L.) plants with the modified levels of alternative oxidase (AOX) were used to evaluate the physiological roles of AOX in regulating nitro-oxidative stress and metabolic changes after exposing plants to hypoxia for 6 h. Under normoxia, AOX expression resulted in the decrease of nitric oxide (NO) levels and of the rate of protein <i>S</i>-nitrosylation, while under hypoxia, AOX overexpressors exhibited higher NO and <i>S</i>-nitrosylation levels than knockdowns. AOX expression was essential in avoiding hypoxia-induced superoxide and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels, and this was achieved via higher activities of catalase and glutathione reductase and the reduced expression of respiratory burst oxidase homolog (Rboh) in overexpressors as compared to knockdowns. The AOX overexpressing lines accumulated less pyruvate and exhibited the increased transcript and activity levels of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase under hypoxia. This suggests that AOX contributes to the energy state of hypoxic tissues by stimulating the increase of pyruvate flow into fermentation pathways. Ethylene biosynthesis genes encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase, ACC oxidase, and ethylene-responsive factors (ERFs) were induced during hypoxia and correlated with AOX and NO levels. We conclude that AOX controls the interaction of NO, reactive oxygen species, and ethylene, triggering a coordinated downstream defensive response against hypoxia.
