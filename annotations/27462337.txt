['27462337', 'A key limitation in modern biology is the ability to rapidly identify genes  underlying newly identified complex phenotypes. Genome wide association studies  (GWAS) have become an increasingly important approach for dissecting natural  variation by associating phenotypes with genotypes at a genome wide level. Recent  work is showing that the Arabidopsis thaliana defense metabolite, allyl  glucosinolate (GSL), may provide direct feedback regulation, linking defense  metabolism outputs to the growth, and defense responses of the plant. However,  there is still a need to identify genes that underlie this process. To start  developing a deeper understanding of the mechanism(s) that modulate the ability  of exogenous allyl GSL to alter growth and defense, we measured changes in plant  biomass and defense metabolites in a collection of natural 96 A. thaliana  accessions fed with 50 muM of allyl GSL. Exogenous allyl GSL was introduced  exclusively to the roots and the compound transported to the leaf leading to a  wide range of heritable effects upon plant biomass and endogenous GSL  accumulation. Using natural variation we conducted GWAS to identify a number of  new genes which potentially control allyl responses in various plant processes.  This is one of the first instances in which this approach has been successfully  utilized to begin dissecting a novel phenotype to the underlying  molecular/polygenic basis.', '2016', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2016.01010', 'Kliebenstein']

GWAS: !associates! phenotype with genotype 
allyl GSL: !modulates! growth and defense responses 
natural variation: !identifies! genes controlling allyl responses 
GWAS: !dissects! novel phenotype to molecular/polygenic basis
