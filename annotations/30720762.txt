A pathogenic lifestyle is inextricably linked with the constant necessity of facing various challenges exerted by the external environment (both within and outside the host). To successfully colonize the host and establish infection, pathogens have evolved sophisticated systems to combat the host defense mechanisms and also to be able to withstand adverse environmental conditions. Proteases, as crucial components of these systems, are involved in a variety of processes associated with infection. In phytopathogenic bacteria, they play important regulatory roles and modulate the expression and functioning of various virulence factors. Secretory proteases directly help avoid recognition by the plant immune systems, and contribute to the deactivation of the defense response pathways. Finally, proteases are important components of protein quality control systems, and thus enable maintaining homeostasis in stressed bacterial cells. In this review, we discuss the known protease functions and protease-regulated signaling processes associated with virulence of plant pathogenic bacteria.
