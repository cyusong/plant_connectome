['19101548', 'The predicted mature portion of a putative 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (DH)  from Arabidopsis was linked to an N-terminal poly-histidine-tag and the fusion  protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Soluble dehydratase was present on  induction at 25 degrees C and pure dehydratase eluted from a nickel-affinity  column in 0.2-0.5M imidazole. High concentrations of imidazole were necessary to  retain enzyme solubility. The dehydratase reaction is reversible and  3-hydroxybutyryl- and 2-butenoyl-ACP substrates were prepared from E. coli  apo-ACP. Analysis of these suggested contamination of apo-ACP with dehydratase  and an additional reverse-phase chromatographic step was required during acyl  carrier protein (ACP) preparation. Activity of purified dehydratase was  demonstrated by mass spectrometry using 2-butenoyl-ACP, providing the first  functional experimental evidence for plant DH gene sequences.', '2009 Jan 22', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2008.12.022', 'Slabas']
