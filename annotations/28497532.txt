['28497532', 'Epoxide hydrolases (EHs) are present in all living organisms. They have been  extensively characterized in mammals; however, their biological functions in  plants have not been demonstrated. Based on in silico analysis, we identified  AtEH1 (At3g05600), a putative Arabidopsis thaliana epoxide hydrolase possibly  involved in cutin monomer synthesis. We expressed AtEH1 in yeast and studied its  localization in vivo. We also analyzed the composition of cutin from A. thaliana  lines in which this gene was knocked out. Incubation of recombinant AtEH1 with  epoxy fatty acids confirmed its capacity to hydrolyze epoxides of C18 fatty acids  into vicinal diols. Transfection of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves with constructs  expressing AtEH1 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) indicated  that AtEH1 is localized in the cytosol. Analysis of cutin monomers in  loss-of-function Ateh1-1 and Ateh1-2 mutants showed an accumulation of  18-hydroxy-9,10-epoxyoctadecenoic acid and a concomitant decrease in  corresponding vicinal diols in leaf and seed cutin. Compared with wild-type  seeds, Ateh1 seeds showed delayed germination under osmotic stress conditions and  increased seed coat permeability to tetrazolium red. This work reports a  physiological role for a plant EH and identifies AtEH1 as a new member of the  complex machinery involved in cutin synthesis.', '2017 Jul', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.14590', 'Pinot']
