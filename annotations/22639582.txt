['22639582', 'The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) consists of several  multi-protein subcomplexes which assemble sequentially at the endosomal surface  and function in multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis. While ESCRT has been  relatively well characterized in yeasts and mammals, comparably little is known  about ESCRT in plants. Here we explored the yeast two-hybrid protein interaction  network and subcellular localization of the Arabidopsis thaliana ESCRT machinery.  We show that the Arabidopsis ESCRT interactome possesses a number of  protein-protein interactions that are either conserved in yeasts and mammals or  distinct to plants. We show also that most of the Arabidopsis ESCRT proteins  examined at least partially localize to MVBs in plant cells when ectopically  expressed on their own or co-expressed with other interacting ESCRT proteins, and  some also induce abnormal MVB phenotypes, consistent with their proposed  functional role(s) as part of the ESCRT machinery in Arabidopsis. Overall, our  results help define the plant ESCRT machinery by highlighting both conserved and  unique features when compared to ESCRT in other evolutionarily diverse organisms,  providing a foundation for further exploration of ESCRT in plants.', '2011', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2011.00020', 'Mullen']
