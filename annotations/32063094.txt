Seed germination, a crucial developmental step, is regulated by multiple plant endogenous signals, among which phytohormones absisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) act antagonistically. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) interact with the two hormones to coordinate germination. We have previously reported that <i>Arabidopsis</i> glutamate receptor homolog3.5 (AtGLR3.5) modulates calcium signal to attenuate the repression effect of ABA on seed germination and that amino acid L-methionine functions upstream of AtGLR3.5, resulting in calcium influx. Here, we show that AtGLR3.5 modulates GA and ROS signaling during seed germination. Our findings provide a more complete picture as to the molecular mechanisms of AtGLR3.5 in seed germination control.

ABA: !represses! Seed germination
GA: !antagonizes! ABA
ROS: !interacts with! ABA & GA
AtGLR3.5: !modulates! Calcium signal & GA signaling
L-methionine: !functions upstream of! AtGLR3.5
