['30962291', 'Plant systemic acquired resistance (SAR) provides an efficient broad-spectrum  immune response to pathogens. SAR involves mobile signal molecules that are  generated by infected tissues and transported to systemic tissues. Methyl  salicylate (MeSA), a molecule that can be converted to salicylic acid (SA), is an  essential signal for establishing SAR, particularly under a short period of  exposure to light after pathogen infection. Thus, the control of MeSA homeostasis  is important for an optimal SAR response. Here, we characterized a uridine  diphosphate-glycosyltransferase, UGT71C3, in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana),  which was induced mainly in leaf tissue by pathogens including Pst DC3000/avrRpt2  (Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato strain DC3000 expressing avrRpt2). Biochemical  analysis indicated that UGT71C3 exhibited strong enzymatic activity toward MeSA  to form MeSA glucosides in vitro and in vivo. After primary pathogen infection by  Pst DC3000/avrRpt2, ugt71c3 knockout mutants exhibited more powerful systemic  resistance to secondary pathogen infection than that of wild-type plants, whereas  systemic resistance in UGT71C3 overexpression lines was compromised. In  agreement, after primary infection of local leaves, ugt71c3 knockout mutants  accumulated significantly more systemic MeSA and SA than that in wild-type  plants. whereas UGT71C3 overexpression lines accumulated less. Our results  suggest that MeSA glucosylation by UGT71C3 facilitates negative regulation of the  SAR response by modulating homeostasis of MeSA and SA. This study unveils further  SAR regulation mechanisms and highlights the role of glucosylation of MeSA and  potentially other systemic signals in negatively modulating plant systemic  defense.', '2019 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00091', 'ORCID:']
