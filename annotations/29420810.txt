Trihelix transcription factors are characterized by containing a conserved trihelix (helix-loop-helix-loop-helix) domain that binds to GT elements required for light response, and they play roles in light stress and in abiotic stress responses. However, only a few of them have been functionally characterized. In the present study, we characterized the function of AST1 (Arabidopsis SIP1 clade Trihelix1) in response to salt and osmotic stress. AST1 shows transcriptional activation activity, and its expression is induced by osmotic and salt stress. A conserved sequence highly present in the promoters of genes regulated by AST1 was identified, which was bound by AST1, and termed the AGAG-box with the sequence [A/G][G/A][A/T]GAGAG. Additionally, AST1 also binds to some GT motifs including the sequence of GGTAATT, TACAGT, GGTAAAT and GGTAAA, but failed in binding to the sequence of GTTAC and GGTTAA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis suggested that AST1 binds to the AGAG-box and/or some GT motifs to regulate the expression of stress tolerance genes, resulting in reduced reactive oxygen species, Na+ accumulation, stomatal apertures, lipid peroxidation, cell death and water loss rate, and increased proline content and reactive oxygen species scavenging capability. These physiological changes affected by AST1 finally improve salt and osmotic tolerance.
