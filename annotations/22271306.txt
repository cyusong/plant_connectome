While many aspects of primary cell wall have been extensively elucidated, our current understanding of secondary wall biosynthesis is limited. Recently, transcription factor MYB46 has been identified as a master regulator of secondary wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. To gain better understanding of this MYB46-mediated transcriptional regulation, we analyzed the promoter region of a direct target gene, AtC3H14, of MYB46 and identified a cis-acting regulatory motif that is recognized by MYB46. This MYB46-responsive cis-regulatory element (M46RE) was further characterized and shown to have an eight-nucleotide core motif, RKTWGGTR. We used electrophoretic mobility shift assay, transient transcriptional activation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis to show that the M46RE was necessary and sufficient for MYB46-responsive transcription. Genome-wide analysis identified that the frequency of M46RE in the promoters were highly enriched among the genes upregulated by MYB46, especially in the group of genes involved in secondary wall biosynthesis.
