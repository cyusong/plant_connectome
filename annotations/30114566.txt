The abscission of plant organs is a phytohormone-controlled process. Our study provides new insight into the involvement of gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) in the functioning of the flower abscission zone (AZ) in yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus L.). Physiological studies demonstrated that GA<sub>3</sub> stimulated flower abortion. Additionally, this phytohormone was abundantly presented in the AZ cells of naturally abscised flowers, especially in vascular bundles. Interesting interactions among GA<sub>3</sub> and other modulators of flower separation were also investigated. GA<sub>3</sub> accumulated after treatment with the ethylene (ET) precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). Abscisic acid (ABA) treatment did not cause such an effect. Furthermore, the expression of the newly identified LlGA20ox1 and LlGA2ox1 genes encoding 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases fluctuated after ACC or ABA treatment which confirmed the existence of regulatory crosstalk. GA<sub>3</sub> appears to cooperate with the ET precursor in the regulation of AZ function in L. luteus flowers; however, the presented mechanism is ABA-independent.
