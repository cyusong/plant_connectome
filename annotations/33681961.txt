The role of small secreted peptides in plant defense responses to viruses has seldom been investigated. Here, we report a role for potato (Solanum tuberosum) PIP1, a gene predicted to encode a member of the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-induced peptide (PIP) family, in the response of potato to Potato virus Y (PVY) infection. We show that exogenous application of synthetic StPIP1 to potato leaves and nodes increased the production of reactive oxygen species and the expression of plant defense-related genes, revealing that StPIP1 triggers early defense responses. In support of this hypothesis, transgenic potato plants that constitutively overexpress StPIP1 had higher levels of leaf callose deposition and, based on measurements of viral RNA titers, were less susceptible to infection by a compatible PVY strain. Interestingly, systemic infection of StPIP1-overexpressing lines with PVY resulted in clear rugose mosaic symptoms that were absent or very mild in infected non-transgenic plants. A transcriptomics analysis revealed that marker genes associated with both pattern-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity were induced in infected StPIP1 overexpressors but not in non-transgenic plants. Together, our results reveal a role for StPIP1 in eliciting plant defense responses and in regulating plant antiviral immunity.
