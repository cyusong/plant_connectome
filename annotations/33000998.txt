<i>Rhizobium</i> (<i>Agrobacterium</i>) is one genus in the family Rhizobiaceae. Most of the species are epi- or endophytic bacteria which include tumorigenic or rhizogenic pathogens, root nodule bacteria, and commensal endosymbionts. <i>Rhizobium vitis</i> strain VAR06-30 is a commensal bacterium without pathogenicity which was isolated from a rootstock of grapevine in Japan. It also does not have antagonistic activity to the pathogenic strain of <i>R. vitis</i>. Here, we show the complete genome sequence data with annotation of <i>R. vitis</i> VAR06-30 which was analyzed by sequence reads obtained from both PacBio and Illumina platforms. This genome sequence would contribute to the understanding of evolutionary lineage and characteristics of <i>Rhizobium</i> commensal bacteria.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).
