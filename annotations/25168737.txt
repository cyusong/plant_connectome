['25168737', 'Tubby and Tubby-like proteins (TLPs) play essential roles in the development and  function of mammal neuronal cells. In addition to the conserved carboxyl  (C)-terminal Tubby domain, which is required for their plasma membrane (PM)  tethering, plant TLPs also possess an amino (N)-terminal F-box domain to interact  with specific Arabidopsis Skp1-like (ASK) proteins as functional SCF-type E3  ligases. Here, we report the molecular characterization of Arabidopsis TLPs  (AtTLPs). beta-Glucuronidase staining showed overlapped but distinct expression  patterns of AtTLPs in Arabidopsis. Yeast two-hybrid assays further revealed that  AtTLP1, AtTLP3, AtTLP6, AtTLP7, AtTLP9, AtTLP10 and AtTLP11 all interacted with  specific ASKs, but AtTLP2, AtTLP5 and AtTLP8 did not. Subcellular localization  observations in both Arabidopsis protoplasts and tobacco pollen tubes indicated  that all GFP-AtTLP fusion proteins, except GFP-AtTLP8 which lacks the conserved  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding sites, were targeted to the PM.  Detailed studies on AtTLP3 demonstrated that AtTLP3 is a PM-tethered PIP2 binding  protein which functions redundantly with AtTLP9 in abscisic acid (ABA)- and  osmotic stress-mediated seed germination. Our results suggest that AtTLPs  possibly work in multiple physiological and developmental processes in  Arabidopsis, and AtTLP3 is also involved in ABA signaling pathway like AtTLP9  during seed germination and early seedling growth.', '2014 Nov', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-014-0241-6', 'Zhang']
