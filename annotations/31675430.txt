Powdery mildew disease, elicited by the obligate fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt), causes widespread yield losses in global wheat crop. However, the molecular mechanisms governing wheat defense to Bgt are still not well understood. Here we found that TuACO3, encoding the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase functioning in ethylene (ET) biosynthesis, was induced by Bgt infection of the einkorn wheat Triticum urartu, which was accompanied by increased ET content. Silencing TuACO3 decreased ET production and compromised wheat defense to Bgt, whereas both processes were enhanced in the transgenic wheat overexpressing TuACO3. TuMYB46L, phylogenetically related to Arabidopsis MYB transcription factor AtMYB46, was found to bind to the TuACO3 promoter region in yeast-one-hybrid and EMSA experiments. TuMYB46L expression decreased rapidly following Bgt infection. Silencing TuMYB46L promoted ET content and Bgt defense, but the reverse was observed when TuMYB46L was overexpressed. Hence, decreased expression of TuMYB46L permits elevated function of TuACO3 in ET biosynthesis in Bgt-infected wheat. The TuMYB46L-TuACO3 module regulates ET biosynthesis to promote einkorn wheat defense against Bgt. Furthermore, we found four chitinase genes acting downstream of the TuMYB46L-TuACO3 module. Collectively, our data shed a new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying wheat defense to Bgt.
