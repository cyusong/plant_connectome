Photosystem I (PSI) is one of the most efficient biological macromolecular complexes that converts solar energy into condensed energy of chemical bonds. Despite high structural complexity, PSI operates with a quantum yield close to 1.0 and to date, no man-made synthetic system approached this remarkable efficiency. This review highlights recent developments in dissecting molecular structure and function of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic PSI. It also overviews progress in the application of this complex as a natural photocathode for production of hydrogen within the biomimetic solar-to-fuel nanodevices.
