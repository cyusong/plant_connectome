['16445886', 'Plants biosynthesize sterols from cycloartenol using a pathway distinct from the  animal and fungal route through lanosterol. Described herein are genome-mining  experiments revealing that Arabidopsis encodes, in addition to cycloartenol  synthase, an accurate lanosterol synthase (LSS)--the first example of lanosterol  synthases cloned from a plant. The coexistence of cycloartenol synthase and  lanosterol synthase implies specific roles for both cyclopropyl and conventional  sterols in plants. Phylogenetic reconstructions reveal that lanosterol synthases  are broadly distributed in eudicots but evolved independently from those in  animals and fungi. Novel catalytic motifs establish that plant lanosterol  synthases comprise a third catalytically distinct class of lanosterol synthase.', '2006 Mar 1', 'Arch Biochem Biophys', '10.1016/j.abb.2005.12.010', 'Matsuda']
