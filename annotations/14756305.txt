['14756305', 'RING zinc-finger proteins play important roles in the regulation of development  in a variety of organisms. In the plant kingdom, few genes encoding RING  zinc-finger proteins have been documented with visible effects on plant growth  and development. A novel gene, RIE1, encoding a RING-H2 zinc-finger protein was  identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and is characterized in this paper. RIE1  encodes a predicted protein product of 359 amino acids residues with a molecular  mass of 40 kDa, with a RING-H2 zinc-finger motif located at the extreme end of  the C-terminus. Characterization of a Dissociation (Ds) insertion line (SGT4559)  and a T-DNA insertion line (SRIE1) demonstrated that disruption of RIE1 is  embryo-lethal. SGT4559 heterozygous plants produced seeds with embryo development  arrested from globular to torpedo stages. Some mutant seeds were rescued by  embryo culture, and the mutant (rie1) plants seemed to grow normally compared to  wild-type plants, except that the mutants produced only abnormal seeds. However,  RIE1 was expressed in different tissues throughout the whole plant as revealed by  northern blot analysis and gene fusion assay of RIE1 promoter with the  beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene. Our results indicated that RIE1 plays an essential  role in seed development.', '2003 Sep', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/b:plan.0000009256.01620.a6', 'Li']
