Industrial hemp is a fast-growing, short-day plant, characterized by high biomass yields and low demands for cultivation. To manipulate growth, hemp is usually cultivated under prolonged photoperiods or continuous light that could cause photooxidative damage and adjustments of photosynthetic reactions. To determine the extent of changes in photosynthetic response caused by prolonged light exposure, we employed chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence measurements accompanied with level of lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and FT-IR spectroscopy on two <i>Cannabis</i> cultivars. Plants were grown under white (W) and purple (P) light at different photoperiods (16/8, 20/4, and 24/0). Our results showed diverse photosynthetic reactions induced by the different light type and by the duration of light exposure in two cultivars. The most beneficial condition was the 16/8 photoperiod, regardless of the light type since it brought the most efficient physiological response and the lowest TBARS contents suggesting the lowest level of thylakoid membrane damage. These findings indicate that different efficient adaptation strategies were employed based on the type of light and the duration of photoperiod. White light, at both photoperiods, caused higher dissipation of excess light causing reduced pressure on PSI. Efficient dissipation of excess energy and formation of cyclic electron transport around PSI suggests that P20/4 initiated an efficient repair system. The P24/0 maintained functional electron transport between two photosystems suggesting a positive effect on the photosynthetic reaction despite the damage to thylakoid membranes.

White light: !dissipates! Excess energy 
Purple light: !initiates! Repair system 
16/8 photoperiod: !brings! Most efficient physiological response 
20/4 photoperiod: !maintains! Functional electron transport 
24/0 photoperiod: !causes! Damage to thylakoid membranes
