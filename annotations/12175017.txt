['12175017', 'The Arabidopsis gene Atrab28 has been shown to be expressed during late  embryogenesis. The pattern of expression of Atrab28 mRNA and protein during  embryo development is largely restricted to provascular tissues of mature  embryos, and in contrast to the maize Rab28 homologue it cannot be induced by ABA  and dehydration in vegetative tissues. Here, we have studied the subcellular  location of Atrab28 protein and the effect of its over-expression in transgenic  Arabidopsis plants. The Atrab28 protein was mainly detected in the nucleus and  nucleolus of cells from mature embryos. In frame fusion of Atrab28 to the  reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) directed the GFP to the nucleus in  transgenic Arabidopsis and in transiently transformed onion cells. Analysis of  chimeric constructs identified an N-terminal region of 60 amino acids containing  a five amino acid motif QPKRP that was necessary for targeting GFP to the  nucleus. These results indicate that Atrab28 protein is targeted to the nuclear  compartments by a new nuclear localization signal (NLS). Transgenic Arabidopsis  plants, with gain of Atrab28 function, showed faster germination rates under  either standard or salt and osmotic stress conditions. Moreover, improved cation  toxicity tolerance was also observed not only during germination but also in  seedlings. These results suggest a role of Atrab28 in the ion cell balance during  late embryogenesis and germination.', '2002 Sep', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1016084615014', 'Pages']
