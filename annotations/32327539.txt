The modification of tRNA is important for accurate, efficient protein translation. A number of tRNA-modifying enzymes were found to influence various developmental processes in distinct organisms. However, few genetic or molecular studies have focused on genes encoding tRNA-modifying enzymes in green plant organelles. Here, we discovered that <i>PDD</i> <sup><i>OL</i></sup> , a natural variation allele of <i>PLEIOTROPIC DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS</i> (<i>PDD</i>), leads to pleiotropic developmental defects in a near-isogenic line (NIL) generated by introgressing the wild rice <i>Oryza longistaminata</i> into the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cv 187R. Map-based cloning revealed that <i>PDD</i> encodes an evolutionarily conserved tRNA-modifying GTPase belonging to the tRNA modification E family. The function of <i>PDD</i> was further confirmed by genetic complementation experiments and mutant analysis. <i>PDD</i> mRNA is primarily expressed in leaves, and PDD is localized to chloroplasts. Biochemical analyses indicated that PDD<sup>187R</sup> forms homodimers and has strong GTPase activity, whereas PDD<sup>OL</sup> fails to form homodimers and has weak GTPase activity. Liquid chromatography-coupled tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry revealed that PDD is associated with the 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification of chloroplast tRNA. Furthermore, compared to 187R, NIL-<i>PDD</i> <sup><i>OL</i></sup> has severely reduced levels of proteins involved in photosynthesis and ribosome biogenesis but increased levels of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase subunits. Finally, we demonstrate that the defect due to <i>PDD</i> <sup><i>OL</i></sup> alters chloroplast gene expression, thereby affecting communication between the chloroplast and the nucleus.
