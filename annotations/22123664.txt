Gly m Bd 28K, Gly m Bd 30K and Gly m Bd 60K are the major soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) allergens limiting the consumption of a good protein source for sensitive individuals. However, little is known about their temporal-spatial expression during seed development and upon germination. The present data shows that soy allergens accumulated in both the embryonic axes and cotyledon, but expression patterns differed depending on the specific allergen. Allergens accumulated sooner and to a greater level in cotyledons than in embryonic axes. Gly m Bd 28 began at 14 d after flowering, 7 to 14 d earlier than Gly m Bd 30K and Gly m Bd 60K. Comparatively, their degradation was faster and more profound in embryonic axes than in cotyledons. Gly m Bd 60K began to decline at 36 h after imbibition and remained detectable up to 108 h in cotyledons. In contrast, the Glym Bd 60K protein was reduced at 24 h, and eventually disappeared at 96 h . In cotyledons Gly m Bd 28K first declined at 24 h, then increased from 36 h to 48 h, followed by its large reduction at 72 h after seed germination. These findings provide useful information on soy allergen biosynthesis and will help move forward towards developing a hypoallergenic soybean for safer food.
