Commercial cultivars of garlic (Allium sativum) do not produce flowers and seed; hence, information on microgametogenesis and genetic knowledge of this important crop is unavailable. Recently, physiological studies enabled flowering and fertility restoration in garlic bolting genotypes by environmental manipulations, thus broadening of the genetic variation and facilitating genetic studies. The present report provides first detailed description of the development of male gametophytes in 11 garlic genotypes varying in their fertility traits. Morphological and anatomical studies revealed completely fertile genotypes, as well as variation in anther and pollen development and disruption of the male organs and gametes at different developmental stages. Three types of plant sterility were observed, including complete sterility, male sterility and environmentally induced male sterility. The ITS1 and ITS2 regions of rRNA of the studied genotypes proved to be strongly conservative and thus did not correspond with the phenotypic expression of fertility or sterility in garlic. On the other hand, two-dimensional protein separation maps revealed significant differences between fertile and sterile genotypes, as well as between developmental stages of microsporogenesis. Further research is needed to investigate the internal mechanisms and environmental component of garlic sterility, as well as the possible molecular markers of these traits.
