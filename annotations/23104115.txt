In a recent study, we demonstrated that although the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins, such as PIN3 and PIN7, are required for the pulse-induced first positive phototropism in etiolated Arabidopsis hypocotyls, they are not necessary for the continuous-light-induced second positive phototropism when the seedlings are grown on the surface of agar medium, which causes the hypocotyls to separate from the agar surface. Previous reports have shown that hypocotyl phototropism is slightly impaired in pin3 single mutants when they are grown along the surface of agar medium, where the hypocotyls always contact the agar, producing some friction. To clarify the possible involvement of PIN3 and PIN7 in continuous-light-induced phototropism, we investigated hypocotyl phototropism in the pin3 pin7 double mutant grown along the surface of agar medium. Intriguingly, the phototropic curvature was slightly impaired in the double mutant when the phototropic stimulus was presented on the adaxial side of the hook, but was not impaired when the phototropic stimulus was presented on the abaxial side of the hook. These results indicate that PIN proteins are required for continuous-light-induced second positive phototropism, depending on the direction of the light stimulus, when the seedlings are in contact with agar medium.
