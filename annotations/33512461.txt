Phytohormones play important roles in regulating various aspects of plant growth and development as well as in biotic and abiotic stress responses. Stomata are openings on the surface of land plants that control gas exchange with the environment. Accumulating evidence shows that various phytohormones, including abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, brassinosteroids, auxin, cytokinin, ethylene, and gibberellic acid, play many roles in the regulation of stomatal development and patterning, and that the cotyledons/leaves and hypocotyls/stems of Arabidopsis exhibit differential responsiveness to phytohormones. In this review, we first discuss the shared regulatory mechanisms controlling stomatal development and patterning in Arabidopsis cotyledons and hypocotyls and those that are distinct. We then summarize current knowledge of how distinct hormonal signaling circuits are integrated into the core stomatal development pathways and how different phytohormones crosstalk to tailor stomatal density and spacing patterns. Knowledge obtained from Arabidopsis may pave the way for future research to elucidate the effects of phytohormones in regulating stomatal development and patterning in cereal grasses for the purpose of increasing crop adaptive responses.
