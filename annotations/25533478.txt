['25533478', 'The loss-of-function mutants of the Arabidopsis orthologue of the wheat LRK10  gene shows ABA-insensitive and drought stress-sensitive phenotypes, suggesting  that LRK10L1.2 is positively involved in ABA signaling. A subset of receptor-like  kinases (RLKs) superfamily proteins play a key role in sensing internal and  external signals. A gene encoding Arabidopsis thaliana Leaf rust 10  disease-resistance locus receptor-like protein kinase 1 (AtLRK10L1), most closely  related to wheat LRK10, expresses two different transcripts, LRK10L1.1 and  LRK10L1.2, using alternative promoters. The T-DNA insertion mutant, lrk10l1-2,  that specifically shuts down LRK10L1.2 transcription displayed an abscisic acid  (ABA)-insensitive phenotype in seed germination and seedling growth. However, the  lrk10l1.2 mutant exhibited reduced tolerance to drought stress, compared with  wild type, which is accompanied by alteration of stomatal apertures. The  transgenic plants overexpressing full-length LRK10L1.2, which localizes to the  plasma membrane (PM) complemented the phenotypes of lrk10l1-2 mutant background,  while those expressing LRK10L1.2 Nu1, which switched its localization to the  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by skipping of a mini-exon, showed even higher ABA  insensitivity and drought sensitivity than its mutant background. Our results  suggest that ABA signaling involves the PM-localized LRK10L1.2.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-014-1724-2', 'Kim']
