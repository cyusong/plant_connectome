['11500544', 'Phospholipase D (PLD), which hydrolyzes phospholipids into free head groups and  phosphatidic acid (PA), may regulate cellular processes through the production of  lipid and lipid-derived messengers. We have genetically abrogated PLD alpha, the  most prevalent isoform of PLD in plants, and the depletion of PLD alpha in  Arabidopsis decreased the levels of PA and superoxide production in Arabidopsis  leaf extracts. Addition of PA promoted the synthesis of superoxide in the PLD  alpha-depleted plants, as measured by chemiluminescence and superoxide  dismutase-inhibitable, NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c and nitroblue  tetrazolium. The PA-enhanced generation of superoxide was associated mainly with  microsomal membranes. Among various lipids tested, PA was the most effective  stimulator with the optimal concentrations between 100 and 200 microM. The  PA-promoted production of superoxide was observed also in leaves directly  infiltrated with PA. The added PA was more effective in stimulating superoxide  generation in the PLD alpha-depleted leaves than in the PLD alpha-containing,  wild-type leaves, suggesting that PA produced in the cell was more effective than  added PA in promoting superoxide production. These data indicate that PLD plays a  role in mediating superoxide production in plants through the generation of PA as  a lipid messenger.', '2001 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.126.4.1449', 'Wang']
