Evaluating the impact of increasing CO<sub>2</sub> on rice quality is becoming a global concern. However, whether adjusting the source-sink ratio will affect the response of rice grain quality to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations remains unknown. In 2016-2018, we conducted a free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment experiment using a popular <i>japonica</i> cultivar grown at ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels (eCO<sub>2</sub>, increased by 200 ppm), reducing the source-sink ratio <i>via</i> cutting leaves (LC) at the heading stage, to investigate the effects of eCO<sub>2</sub> and LC and their interactions on rice processing, appearance, nutrition, and eating quality. Averaged across 3 years, eCO<sub>2</sub> significantly decreased brown rice percentage (-0.5%), milled rice percentage (-2.1%), and head rice percentage (-4.2%) but increased chalky grain percentage (+ 22.3%) and chalkiness degree (+ 26.3%). Markedly, eCO<sub>2</sub> increased peak viscosity (+ 2.9%) and minimum viscosity (+ 3.8%) but decreased setback (-96.1%) of powder rice and increased the appearance (+ 4.5%), stickiness (+ 3.5%) and balance degree (+ 4.8%) of cooked rice, while decreasing the hardness (-6.7%), resulting in better palatability (+ 4.0%). Further, eCO<sub>2</sub> significantly decreased the concentrations of protein, Ca, S, and Cu by 5.3, 4.7, 2.2, and 9.6%, respectively, but increased K concentration by 3.9%. Responses of nutritional quality in different grain positions (brown and milled rice) to eCO<sub>2</sub> showed the same trend. Compared with control treatment, LC significantly increased chalky grain percentage, chalkiness degree, protein concentration, mineral element levels (except for B and Mn), and phytic acid concentration. Our results indicate that eCO<sub>2</sub> reduced rice processing suitability, appearance, and nutritional quality but improved the eating quality. Rice quality varied significantly among years; however, few CO<sub>2</sub> by year, CO<sub>2</sub> by LC, or CO<sub>2</sub> by grain position interactions were detected, indicating that the effects of eCO<sub>2</sub> on rice quality varied little with the growing seasons, the decrease in the source-sink ratios or the different grain positions.
