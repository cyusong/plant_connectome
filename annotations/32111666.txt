Studies on Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)/phosphate translocator isoforms GPT1 and GPT2 reported the viability of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>gpt2</i> mutants, whereas heterozygous <i>gpt1</i> mutants exhibited a variety of defects during fertilization/seed set, indicating that GPT1 is essential for this process. Among other functions, GPT1 was shown to be important for pollen and embryo-sac development. Because our previous work on the irreversible part of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) revealed comparable effects, we investigated whether GPT1 may dually localize to plastids and peroxisomes. In reporter fusions, GPT2 localized to plastids, but GPT1 also localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and around peroxisomes. GPT1 contacted two oxidoreductases and also peroxins that mediate import of peroxisomal membrane proteins from the ER, hinting at dual localization. Reconstitution in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) proteoliposomes revealed that GPT1 preferentially exchanges G6P for ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P). Complementation analyses of heterozygous +/<i>gpt1</i> plants demonstrated that GPT2 is unable to compensate for GPT1 in plastids, whereas GPT1 without the transit peptide (enforcing ER/peroxisomal localization) increased <i>gpt1</i> transmission significantly. Because OPPP activity in peroxisomes is essential for fertilization, and immunoblot analyses hinted at the presence of unprocessed GPT1-specific bands, our findings suggest that GPT1 is indispensable in both plastids and peroxisomes. Together with its G6P-Ru5P exchange preference, GPT1 appears to play a role distinct from that of GPT2 due to dual targeting.
