The plant serine/arginine-rich (SR) splicing factor SR45 plays important roles in several biological processes, such as splicing, DNA methylation, innate immunity, glucose regulation, and abscisic acid signaling. A homozygous Arabidopsis sr45-1 null mutant is viable, but exhibits diverse phenotypic alterations, including delayed root development, late flowering, shorter siliques with fewer seeds, narrower leaves and petals, and unusual numbers of floral organs. Here, we report that the sr45-1 mutant presents an unexpected constitutive iron deficiency phenotype characterized by altered metal distribution in the plant. RNA-Sequencing highlighted severe perturbations in metal homeostasis, the phenylpropanoid pathway, oxidative stress responses, and reproductive development. Ionomic quantification and histochemical staining revealed strong iron accumulation in the sr45-1 root tissues accompanied by iron starvation in aerial parts. Mis-splicing of several key iron homeostasis genes, including BTS, bHLH104, PYE, FRD3, and ZIF1, was observed in sr45-1 roots. We showed that some sr45-1 developmental abnormalities can be complemented by exogenous iron supply. Our findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms governing the phenotypes of the sr45-1 mutant.
