BEIIb plays a specific role in determining the structure of amylopectin in rice endosperm, whereas BEIIa plays the similar role in the culm where BEIIb is absent. Cereals have three types of starch branching enzymes (BEs), BEI, BEIIa, and BEIIb. It is widely known that BEIIb is specifically expressed in the endosperm and plays a distinct role in the structure of amylopectin because in its absence the amylopectin type changes to the amylose-extender-type (ae-type) or B-type from the wild-type or A-type and this causes the starch crystalline allomorph to the B-type from the wild-type A-type. This study aimed to clarify the role of BEIIa in the culm where BEIIb is not expressed, by using a be2a mutant in comparison with results with be2b and be1 mutants. The results showed that the amylopectin structure exhibited the B-type in the be2a culm compared with the A-type in the wild-type culm. The starch granules from the be2a culm also showed the B-type like allomorph when examined by X-ray diffraction analysis and optical sum frequency generation spectroscopy. Both amylopectin chain-length profile and starch crystalline properties were found to be the A-type at the very early stage of endosperm development at 4-6 days after pollination (DAP) even in the be2b mutant. All these results support a view that in the culm as well as in the endosperm at 4-6 DAP, BEIIa can play the role of BEIIb which has been well documented in maturing endosperm. The possible mechanism as to how BEIIa can play its role is discussed.
