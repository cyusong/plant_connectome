Understanding the response to cold temperature stress is relevant for both basic biology and application. Here we report on ERF105, which is a novel cold-regulated transcription factor gene of Arabidopsis that makes a significant contribution to freezing tolerance and cold acclimation. The expression of cold-responsive genes in erf105 mutants suggests that its action is linked to the CBF regulon mediating cold responses.
