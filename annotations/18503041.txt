['18503041', 'Despite a very complex structure, the sugar composition of the rhamnogalacturonan  II (RG-II) pectic fraction is extremely conserved. Among its constituting  monosaccharides is the seldom-observed eight-carbon sugar  3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo), whose phosphorylated precursor is  synthesized by Kdo-8-P synthase. As an attempt to alter specifically the RG-II  structure in its sugar composition and assess the consequences on the function of  RG-II in cell wall and its relationship with growth, Arabidopsis null mutants  were sought in the genes encoding Kdo-8-P synthase. Here, the isolation and  characterization of one null mutant for the isoform 1 (AtkdsA1-S) and two  distinct null mutants for the isoform 2 of Arabidopsis Kdo-8-P synthase  (AtkdsA2-V and AtkdsA2-S) are described. Evidence is provided that AtkdsA2 gene  expression is preferentially associated with plantlet organs displaying a  meristematic activity, and that it accounts for 75% of the mRNAs to be translated  into Kdo-8-P synthase. Furthermore, this predominant expression of AtKDSA2 over  AtKDSA1 was confirmed by quantification of the cytosolic Kdo content in the  mutants, in a variety of ecotypes. The inability to identify a double knockout  mutant originated from pollen abortions, due to the inability of haploid pollen  of the AtkdsA1- AtkdsA2- genotype to form an elongated pollen tube properly and  perform fertilization.', '2008', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ern118', 'Chevalier']
