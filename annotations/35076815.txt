Advancements in sequencing, genotyping, and computational technologies during the last decade (2011-2020) enabled new forward-genetic approaches, which subdue the impediments of precise gene mapping in varied crops. The modern crop improvement programs rely heavily on two major steps-trait-associated QTL/gene/marker's identification and molecular breeding. Thus, it is vital for basic and translational crop research to identify genomic regions that govern the phenotype of interest. Until the advent of next-generation sequencing, the forward-genetic techniques were laborious and time-consuming. Over the last 10 years, advancements in the area of genome assembly, genotyping, large-scale data analysis, and statistical algorithms have led faster identification of genomic variations regulating the complex agronomic traits and pathogen resistance. In this review, we describe the latest developments in genome sequencing and genotyping along with a comprehensive evaluation of the last 10-year headways in forward-genetic techniques that have shifted the focus of plant research from model plants to diverse crops. We have classified the available molecular genetic methods under bulk-segregant analysis-based (QTL-seq, GradedPool-Seq, QTG-Seq, Exome QTL-seq, and RapMap), target sequence enrichment-based (RenSeq, AgRenSeq, and TACCA), and mutation-based groups (MutMap, NIKS algorithm, MutRenSeq, MutChromSeq), alongside improvements in classical mapping and genome-wide association analyses. Newer methods for outcrossing, heterozygous, and polyploid plant genetics have also been discussed. The use of k-mers has enriched the nature of genetic variants which can be utilized to identify the phenotype-causing genes, independent of reference genomes. We envisage that the recent methods discussed herein will expand the repertoire of useful alleles and help in developing high-yielding and climate-resilient crops.
