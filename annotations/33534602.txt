This article is part of the Top 10 Unanswered Questions in MPMI invited review series.That plants recruit beneficial microbes while simultaneously restricting pathogens is critical to their survival. Plants must exclude pathogens; however, most land plants are able to form mutualistic symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Plants also associate with the complex microbial communities that form the microbiome. The outcome of each symbiotic interaction-whether a specific microbe is pathogenic, commensal, or mutualistic-relies on the specific interplay of host and microbial genetics and the environment. Here, we discuss how plants use metabolites as a gate to select which microbes can be symbiotic. Once present, we discuss how plants integrate multiple inputs to initiate programs of immunity or mutualistic symbiosis and how this paradigm may be expanded to the microbiome. Finally, we discuss how environmental signals are integrated with immunity to fine-tune a thermostat that determines whether a plant engages in mutualism, resistance to pathogens, and shapes associations with the microbiome. Collectively, we propose that the plant immune thermostat is set to select for and tolerate a largely nonharmful microbiome while receptor-mediated decision making allows plants to detect and dynamically respond to the presence of potential pathogens or mutualists.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
