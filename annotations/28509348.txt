Ubiquitination modulates nearly all aspects of plant life. Here, we reconstituted the Arabidopsis thaliana ubiquitination cascade in Escherichia coli using a synthetic biology approach. In this system, plant proteins are expressed and then immediately participate in ubiquitination reactions within E. coli cells. Additionally, the purification of individual ubiquitination components prior to setting up the ubiquitination reactions is omitted. To establish the reconstituted system, we co-expressed Arabidopsis ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitination substrates with E1, E2 and E3 enzymes in E. coli using the Duet expression vectors. The functionality of the system was evaluated by examining the auto-ubiquitination of a RING (really interesting new gene)-type E3 ligase AIP2 and the ubiquitination of its substrate ABI3. Our results demonstrated the fidelity and specificity of this system. In addition, we applied this system to assess a subset of Arabidopsis E2s in Ub chain formation using E2 conjugation assays. Affinity-tagged Ub allowed efficient purification of Ub conjugates in milligram quantities. Consistent with previous reports, distinct roles of various E2s in Ub chain assembly were also observed in this bacterial system. Therefore, this reconstituted system has multiple advantages, and it can be used to screen for targets of E3 ligases or to study plant ubiquitination in detail.
