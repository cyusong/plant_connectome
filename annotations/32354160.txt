Abiotic stresses are major constraints limiting crop growth and production. Heat shock factors (Hsfs) play significant roles in mediating plant resistance to various environmental stresses, including heat, drought and salinity. In this study, we explored the biological functions and underlying mechanisms of wheat <i>TaHsfA6f</i> in plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses. Gene expression profiles showed that <i>TaHsfA6f</i> has relatively high expression levels in wheat leaves at the reproductive stage. Transcript levels of <i>TaHsfA6f</i> were substantially up-regulated by heat, dehydration, salinity, low temperature, and multiple phytohormones, but was not induced by brassinosteroids (BR). Subcellular localization analyses revealed that TaHsfA6f is localized to the nucleus. Overexpression of the <i>TaHsfA6f</i> gene in <i>Arabidopsis</i> results in improved tolerance to heat, drought and salt stresses, enhanced sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), and increased accumulation of ABA. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing data demonstrated that <i>TaHsfA6f</i> functions through up-regulation of a number of genes involved in ABA metabolism and signaling, and other stress-associated genes. Collectively, these results provide evidence that <i>TaHsfA6f</i> participates in the regulation of multiple abiotic stresses, and that <i>TaHsfA6f</i> could serve as a valuable gene for genetic modification of crop abiotic stress tolerance.
