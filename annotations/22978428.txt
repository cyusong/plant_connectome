Previously, we showed that inoculation of tobacco with Pseudomonas syringae incompatible pv. maculicola results in a rapid and persistent burst of superoxide (O(2) (-) ) from mitochondria, no change in amount of mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) and induction of the hypersensitive response (HR). However, inoculation with incompatible pv. phaseolicola resulted in increased AOX, no O(2) (-) burst and no HR. Here, we show that in transgenic plants unable to induce AOX in response to pv. phaseolicola, there is now a strong mitochondrial O(2) (-) burst, similar to that normally seen only with pv. maculicola. This interaction did not however result in a HR. This indicates that AOX amount is a key determinant of the mitochondrial O(2) (-) burst but also that the burst itself is not sufficient to induce the HR. Surprisingly, the O(2) (-) burst normally seen towards pv. maculicola is delayed in plants lacking AOX. This delay is associated with a delayed HR, suggesting that the burst does promote the HR. A O(2) (-) burst can also be induced by the complex III inhibitor antimycin A (AA), but is again delayed in plants lacking AOX. The similar mitochondrial response induced by pv. maculicola and AA suggests that electron transport is a target during HR-inducing biotic interactions.

Pv. maculicola: !induces! O(2) (-) burst 
AOX: !regulates! O(2) (-) burst 
O(2) (-) burst: !promotes! HR 
AA: !induces! O(2) (-) burst 
AOX: !delays! O(2) (-) burst
