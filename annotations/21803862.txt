Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) trichome development is a model system for studying cell development, cell differentiation, and the cell cycle. Our previous studies have shown that the GLABROUS INFLORESCENCE STEMS (GIS) family genes, GIS, GIS2, and ZINC FINGER PROTEIN8 (ZFP8), control shoot maturation and epidermal cell fate by integrating gibberellins (GAs) and cytokinin signaling in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that a new C2H2 zinc finger protein, ZFP5, plays an important role in controlling trichome cell development through GA signaling. Overexpression of ZFP5 results in the formation of ectopic trichomes on carpels and other inflorescence organs. zfp5 loss-of-function mutants exhibit a reduced number of trichomes on sepals, cauline leaves, paraclades, and main inflorescence stems in comparison with wild-type plants. More importantly, it is found that ZFP5 mediates the regulation of trichome initiation by GAs. These results are consistent with ZFP5 expression patterns and the regional influence of GA on trichome initiation. The molecular analyses suggest that ZFP5 functions upstream of GIS, GIS2, ZFP8, and the key trichome initiation regulators GLABROUS1 (GL1) and GL3. Using a steroid-inducible activation of ZFP5 and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, we further demonstrate that ZFP8 is the direct target of ZFP5 in controlling epidermal cell differentiation.
