N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal modification in eukaryotic messenger RNA. Although the role of m6A has been demonstrated in many biological processes, including embryonic development, flowering time control, microspore generation, fruit ripening, and stress responses, its contribution to other aspects of plant development still needs to be explored. Herein, we show the potential link between m6A deposition and the expansion of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruits through parallel m6A-immunoprecipitation-sequencing (m6A-seq) and RNA-seq analyses. We found that global m6A levels increased during tomato fruit expansion from immature green to mature green stage. m6A-seq revealed that thousands of protein-coding genes are m6A-modified mainly in the 3'-untranslated regions. m6A-seq and RNA-seq analyses showed a positive association between m6A methylation and mRNA abundance. In particular, a large number of fruit expansion-related genes involved in hormone responses and endoreduplication were m6A modified and expressed more actively than the non-m6A-modified genes, suggesting a potential role of m6A modification in tomato fruit expansion. Importantly, altering m6A levels by direct injection of 3-deazaneplanocin A (DA; m6A writer inhibitor) or meclofenamic acid (MA; m6A eraser inhibitor) into tomato fruits suppressed fruit expansion; however, injection of exogenous DA or MA accelerated or delayed fruit ripening, respectively. Collectively, these results suggest a dynamic role of m6A methylation in the expansion and ripening of tomato fruits.
