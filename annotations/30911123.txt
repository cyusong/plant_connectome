Technology involving the targeted mutagenesis of plants using programmable nucleases has been developing rapidly and has enormous potential in next-generation plant breeding. Notably, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) (CRISPR-Cas9) system has paved the way for the development of rapid and cost-effective procedures to create new mutant populations in plants<sup>1,2</sup>. Although genome-edited plants from multiple species have been produced successfully using a method in which a Cas9-guide RNA (gRNA) expression cassette and selectable marker are integrated into the genomic DNA by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation or particle bombardment<sup>3</sup>, CRISPR-Cas9 integration increases the chance of off-target modifications<sup>4</sup>, and foreign DNA sequences cause legislative concerns about genetically modified organisms<sup>5</sup>. Therefore, DNA-free genome editing has been developed, involving the delivery of preassembled Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into protoplasts derived from somatic tissues by polyethylene glycol-calcium (PEG-Ca<sup>2+</sup>)-mediated transfection in tobacco, Arabidopsis, lettuce, rice<sup>6</sup>, Petunia<sup>7</sup>, grapevine, apple<sup>8</sup> and potato<sup>9</sup>, or into embryo cells by biolistic bombardment in maize<sup>10</sup> and wheat<sup>11</sup>. However, the isolation and culture of protoplasts is not feasible in most plant species and the frequency of obtaining genome-edited plants through biolistic bombardment is relatively low. Here, we report a genome-editing system via direct delivery of Cas9-gRNA RNPs into plant zygotes. Cas9-gRNA RNPs were transfected into rice zygotes produced by in vitro fertilization of isolated gametes<sup>12</sup> and the zygotes were cultured into mature plants in the absence of selection agents, resulting in the regeneration of rice plants with targeted mutations in around 14-64% of plants. This efficient plant-genome-editing system has enormous potential for the improvement of rice as well as other important crop species.
