Cardamine violifolia, native to China, is one of the selenium (Se) hyperaccumulators. The mechanism of Se metabolism and tolerance remains unclear, and only limited genetic information is currently available. Therefore, we combined a PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) transcriptome library and the Illumina RNA-seq data of sodium selenate (Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub>)-treated C. violifolia to further reveal the molecular mechanism of Se metabolism. The concentrations of the total, inorganic, and organic Se in C. violifolia seedlings significantly increased as the Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub> treatment concentration increased. From SMRT full-length transcriptome of C. violifolia, we obtained 26,745 annotated nonredundant transcripts, 14,269 simple sequence repeats, 283 alternative splices, and 3407 transcription factors. Fifty-one genes from 134 transcripts were identified to be involved in Se metabolism, including transporter, assimilatory enzyme, and several specific genes. Analysis of Illumina RNA-Seq data showed that a total of 948 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered from the four groups with Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub> treatment, among which 11 DEGs were related to Se metabolism. The enrichment analysis of KEGG pathways of all the DEGs showed that they were significantly enriched in five pathways, such as hormone signal transduction and plant-pathogen interaction pathways. Four genes related to Se metabolism, adenosine triphosphate sulfurase 1, adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase 3, cysteine (Cys) desulfurase 1, and serine acetyltransferase 2, were regulated by lncRNAs. Twenty potential hub genes (e.g., sulfate transporter 1;1, Cys synthase, methionine gamma-lyase, and Se-binding protein 1) were screened and identified to play important roles in Se accumulation and tolerance in C. violifolia as concluded by weighted gene correlation network analysis. Based on combinative analysis of expression profiling and annotation of genes as well as Se speciation and concentration in C. violifolia under the treatments with different Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub> concentrations, a putative Se metabolism and assimilation pathway in C. violifolia was proposed. Our data provide abundant information on putative gene transcriptions and pathway involved in Se metabolism of C. violifolia. The findings present a genetic resource and provide novel insights into the mechanism of Se hyperaccumulation in C. violifolia.
