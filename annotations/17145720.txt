Ca2+-signaling in downstream effectors is supported by many kinds of Ca2+-binding proteins, which function as a signal mediator and a Ca2+-buffering protein. We found in Arabidopsis thaliana a new type of Ca2+-binding protein, CCaP1, which consists of 152 amino acid residues, and binds (45)Ca2+ even in the presence of a high concentration of Mg2+. We found two other proteins with similar motifs, CCaP2 and CCaP3. These three proteins had no organelle localization signal and their green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions were detected in the cytosol. Real-time PCR and histochemical analysis of promoter-beta-glucuronidase fusions revealed that CCaP1 was predominantly expressed in petioles while CCaP2 was expressed in roots. CCaP3 was hardly expressed. Expression of CCaP1 and CCaP2 was enhanced in darkness and became maximal after 24 h. Immunoblotting revealed petiole-specific accumulation of CCaP1. Expression of CCaP1 and CCaP2 was suppressed by a high concentration of Ca2+ and other metal ions. Deletion of sucrose from the medium markedly increased the mRNA levels of CCaP1 and CCaP2 within 2 h. Gibberellic acid enhanced the expression of CCaP1 and CCaP2 by 5- and 2.5-fold, respectively, after 6 h. CCaP1 and CCaP2 were suppressed in the petiole and the root, respectively, by light and the product of photosynthesis (sucrose) or both. These results suggest that CCaP1 functions as a mediator in response to continuous dark or gibberellic acid.
