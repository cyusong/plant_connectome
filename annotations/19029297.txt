['19029297', 'Arsenite [As(III)] is highly toxic to organisms, including plants. Very recently,  transporters in rice responsible for As(III) transport have been described (Ma,  J. F., Yamaji, N., Mitani, N., Xu, X. Y., Su, Y. H., McGrath, S. P., and Zhao, F.  J. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 105, 9931-9935), but little is known  about As(III) tolerance. In this study, three independent As(III)-tolerant  mutants were isolated from ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized M2 seeds of  Arabidopsis thaliana. All three mutants carried independent mutations in Nodulin  26-like intrinsic protein 1;1 (NIP1;1), a homolog of an aquaporin. Two  independent transgenic lines carrying T-DNA in NIP1;1 were highly tolerant to  As(III), establishing that NIP1;1 is the causal gene of As(III) tolerance.  Because an aquaglyceroporin is able to transport As(III), we measured As(III)  transport activity. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, NIP1;1 was capable of  transporting As(III). As content in the mutant plants was 30% lower than in  wild-type plants. Promoter beta-glucuronidase and real-time PCR analysis showed  that NIP1;1 is highly expressed in roots, and GFP-NIP1;1 is localized to the  plasma membrane. These data show that NIP1;1 is involved in As(III) uptake into  roots and that disruption of NIP1;1 function confers As(III) tolerance to plants.  NIP1;2 and NIP5;1, closely related homologs of NIP1;1, were also permeable to  As(III). Although the disruption of these genes reduced the As content in plants,  As(III) tolerance was not observed in nip1;2 and nip5;1 mutants. This indicates  that As(III) tolerance cannot be simply explained by decreased As contents in  plants.', '2009 Jan 23', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M806881200', 'Fujiwara']
