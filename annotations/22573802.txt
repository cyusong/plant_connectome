Many plant species grow extrafloral nectaries and produce nectar to attract carnivore arthropods as defenders against herbivores. Two nectary types that evolved with Populus trichocarpa (Ptr) and Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides (Ptt) were studied from their ecology down to the genes and molecules. Both nectary types strongly differ in morphology, nectar composition and mode of secretion, and defense strategy. In Ptt, nectaries represent constitutive organs with continuous merocrine nectar flow, nectary appearance, nectar production, and flow. In contrast, Ptr nectaries were found to be holocrine and inducible. Neither mechanical wounding nor the application of jasmonic acid, but infestation by sucking insects, induced Ptr nectar secretion. Thus, nectaries of Ptr and Ptt seem to answer the same threat by the use of different mechanisms.

Ptr nectaries: !are holocrine and inducible! 
Ptt nectaries: !are constitutive organs with continuous merocrine nectar flow! 
Mechanical wounding: !does not induce! Ptr nectar secretion 
Jasmonic acid: !does not induce! Ptr nectar secretion 
Infestation by sucking insects: !induces! Ptr nectar secretion
