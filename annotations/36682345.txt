Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), as an intermediate product of nitrogen metabolism, is recognized as a novel gasotransmitter (namely gaseous signaling molecule), its signaling role being revealed in plants. NH<sub>3</sub> exists in two different chemical forms, namely the weak base (free molecule: NH<sub>3</sub>) and the weak acid (ammonium: NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), which are generally in equilibrium with each other in plants. However, the effect of NH<sub>3</sub> on seed germination, seedling growth, and thermotolerance acquirement in maize remains unclear. Here, maize seeds were imbibed in the different concentrations of NH<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O (NH<sub>3</sub> donor), and then germinated and calculated seed germination rate at the various time points. Also, the 60-h-old seedlings were irrigated in the different concentrations of NH<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O, and then subjected to heat stress and counted survival rate. The data implied that the appropriate concentrations (6, 9, and 12 mM) of NH<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O accelerated seed germination as well as increased seedling height and root length compared with the control without NH<sub>3</sub> treatment. Also, the suitable concentrations (2 and 4 mM) of NH<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O improved tissue vitality, relieved an increase in malondialdehyde content, and enhanced survival rate of maize seedlings under heat stress compared with the control. These results firstly suggest that NH<sub>3</sub> could accelerate seed germination, seedling growth, and thermotolerance acquirement in maize.
