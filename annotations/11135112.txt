['11135112', 'Genome analyses have shown that plants contain gene families encoding various  components of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.  Previous reports have described the involvement of MAPK pathways in stress and  pathogen responses of leaves and suspension-cultured cells. Here we show that  auxin treatment of Arabidopsis roots transiently induced increases in protein  kinase activity with characteristics of mammalian ERK-like MAPKs. The MAPK  response we monitored was the result of hormonal action of biologically active  auxin, rather than a stress response provoked by auxin-like compounds.  Auxin-induced MAPK pathway signaling was distinguished genetically in the  Arabidopsis auxin response mutant axr4, in which MAPK activation by auxin, but  not by salt stress, was significantly impaired. Perturbation of MAPK signaling in  roots using inhibitors of a mammalian MAPKK blocked auxin-activated transgene  expression in BA3-GUS seedlings, while potentiating higher than normal levels of  MAPK activation in response to auxin. Data presented here indicate that MAPK  pathway signaling is positively involved in auxin response, and further suggest  that interactions among MAPK signaling pathways in plants influence plant  responses to auxin.', '2000 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00921.x', 'Howell']
