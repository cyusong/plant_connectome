['10561075', 'Ion uptake, transport, and sequestration are essential to meet the nutritional  requirements for plant growth and development. Furthermore, regulation of these  processes is critical for plants to tolerate toxic levels of ions. The  examination of isoprenylated proteins encoded by Arabidopsis thaliana and Glycine  max cDNAs revealed a unique family of proteins containing putative metal-binding  motifs (the core sequence is M/LXCXXC). Here, we describe this new class of  proteins, which are capable of being isoprenylated and binding transition metal  ions. Members of this family contain consensus isoprenylation (CaaX) sites, which  we demonstrate are efficiently isoprenylated in vitro. ATFP3, a representative of  the Arabidopsis family, was expressed in Escherichia coli and examined for  metal-binding activity in vitro. Analysis of the interaction of ATFP3 with  metal-chelating columns (IMAC) suggested that it binds to Cu2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+. To  test whether proteins with these characteristics are present in other plant  species, tobacco BY2 cells were labeled in vivo with [14C]mevalonate and the  resulting mevalonate-labeled proteins were tested for metal-binding activity.  Several soluble, isoprenylated proteins which bound copper-IMAC columns were  revealed. Consistent with a wide-spread distribution of these proteins in plants,  their presence was observed in Arabidopsis, soybean, and tobacco.', '1999 Sep', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1006367609556', 'Randall']
