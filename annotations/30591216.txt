['30591216', 'As the global temperature gradually increases, thermotolerance is vital to the  growth and survival for plants. Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is a  central regulator of many key cellular and physiological processes, including  responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. E3 Ubiquitin-ligases, as the major  components in the ubiquitination pathway, confer specificity of substrate  recognition. Herein, we report that AtPUB48 expression was induced by heat  stress, including basal and acquired thermotolerance. AtPUB48-overexpressing  lines (OEs) of plants were generated to detect the functions of AtPUB48 in the  heat response signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. Seeds of Atpub48-2 mutant had a  lower germination rate than those of wild-type (WT) and OE plants when suffered  from high temperatures. On the contrary, overexpression of AtPUB48 in Arabidopsis  enhanced basal and acquired thermotolerance in seed germination and seedling  growth. Moreover, the transcript expression levels of several heat-related  downstream genes were highly improved in the OE lines under heat stress, although  there were lower levels in the Atpub48-2 mutant compared with that of WT. An  in vitro ubiquitination assay confirmed that AtPUB48 with U-box and ARM-repeats  functioned as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The subcellular localization showed that  AtPUB48 localized to the nucleus. Collectively, these data imply that AtPUB48  acts as a novel regulator in the heat response signaling pathway. AtPUB48 may  target the unknown substrate receptor to 26S proteasome proteolysis.', '2019 Jan 29', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.12.123', 'Wang']
