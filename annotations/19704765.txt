Legume plants have a unique ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen via symbiosis with rhizobia. For the establishment of symbiosis, legume plants secrete signaling molecules such as flavonoids from root tissues, leading to the attraction of rhizobia and the induction of rhizobial nod genes. Genistein and daidzein are found in soybean root exudates and function as signal molecules in soybean-Bradyrhizobium japonicum chemical communication. Although it is more than 20 years since these signal flavonoids were identified, almost nothing has been characterized concerning the membrane transport process of these molecules from soybean roots. To elucidate the transport mechanism we performed membrane transport assays with plasma membrane-enriched vesicles and various inhibitors. As a result, we concluded that an ATP-binding cassette-type transporter is involved in the secretion of genistein from soybean roots. The possible involvement of a pleiotropic drug resistance-type ABC transporter in this secretion is also discussed.
