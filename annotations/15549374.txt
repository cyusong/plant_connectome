['15549374', 'The maize (Zea mays L.) CRINKLY4 (CR4) gene encodes a serine/threonine  receptor-like kinase that controls an array of developmental processes in the  plant and endosperm. The Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. genome encodes an  ortholog of CR4, ACR4, and four CRINKLY4-RELATED (CRR) proteins: AtCRR1, AtCRR2,  AtCRR3 and AtCRK1. The available genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa L.)  encodes a CR4 ortholog, OsCR4, and four CRR proteins: OsCRR1, OsCRR2, OsCRR3 and  OsCRR4, not necessarily orthologous to the Arabidopsis CRRs. A phylogenetic study  showed that AtCRR1 and AtCRR2 form a clade closest to the CR4 group while all the  other CRRs form a separate cluster. The five Arabidopsis genes are differentially  expressed in various tissues. A construct formed by fusion of the ACR4 promoter  and the GUS reporter, ACR4::GUS, is expressed primarily in developing tissues of  the shoot. The ACR4 cytoplasmic domain functions in vitro as a serine/threonine  kinase, while the AtCRR1 and AtCRR2 kinases are not active. The ability of ACR4  to phosphorylate AtCRR2 suggests that they might function in the same signal  transduction pathway. T-DNA insertions were obtained in ACR4, AtCRR1, AtCRR2,  AtCRR3 and AtCRK1. Mutations in acr4 show a phenotype restricted to the  integuments and seed coat, suggesting that Arabidopsis might contain a redundant  function that is lacking in maize. The lack of obvious mutant phenotypes in the  crr mutants indicates they are not required for the hypothetical redundant  function.', '2005 Mar', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-004-1378-3', 'Becraft']
