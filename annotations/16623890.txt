['16623890', 'The functional characterization of mammalian proteins containing a  methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) has revealed that MBD proteins can decipher the  epigenetic information encoded by DNA methylation, and integrate DNA methylation,  modification of chromatin structure and repression of gene expression. The  Arabidopsis genome has 13 putative genes encoding MBD proteins, and no specific  biological function has been defined for any AtMBD genes. In this study, we  identified three T-DNA insertion mutant alleles at the AtMBD9 locus, and found  that all of them exhibited obvious developmental abnormalities. First, the atmbd9  mutants flowered significantly earlier than wild-type plants. The expression of  FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a major repressor of Arabidopsis flowering, was markedly  attenuated by the AtMBD9 mutations. This FLC transcription reduction was  associated with a significant decrease in the acetylation level in histone H3 and  H4 of FLC chromatin in the atmbd9 mutants. Secondly, the atmbd9 mutants produced  more shoot branches by increasing the outgrowth of axillary buds when compared  with wild-type plants. The two known major factors controlling the outgrowth of  axillary buds in Arabidopsis, auxin and the more axillary growth (MAX) pathway,  were found not to be involved in producing this enhanced shoot branching  phenotype in atmbd9 mutants, indicating that AtMBD9 may regulate a novel pathway  to control shoot branching. This pathway is not related to FLC expression as  over-expression of FLC in atmbd9-2 restored its flowering time to one similar to  that of the wild type, but did not alter the shoot branching phenotype.', '2006 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02691.x', 'Rothstein']
