In natural habitats, especially in arid areas, plants are often simultaneously exposed to multiple abiotic stresses, such as salt, osmotic and heat stresses. However, most analyses of gene expression in stress responses examine individual stresses. In this report, we compare gene expression in individual and combined stresses. We show that combined stress treatments with salt, mannitol and heat induce a unique pattern of gene expression that is not a simple merge of the individual stress responses. Under multiple stress conditions, expression of most heat and salt stress-responsive genes increased to levels similar to or higher than those measured in single stress conditions, but osmotic stress-responsive genes increased to lower levels. Genes up-regulated to higher levels under multiple stress condition than single stress conditions include genes for heat shock proteins, heat shock regulators and late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEAs), which protect other proteins from damage caused by stresses, suggesting their importance in multiple stress condition. Based on this analysis, we identify candidate genes for engineering crop plants tolerant to multiple stresses.
