Plant hormones are essential for regulating the interactions between plants and their complex biotic and abiotic environments. Each hormone initiates a specific molecular pathway and these different hormone pathways are integrated in a complex network of synergistic, antagonistic and additive interactions. This inter-pathway communication is called hormone crosstalk. By influencing the immune network topology, hormone crosstalk is essential for tailoring plant responses to diverse microbes and insects in diverse environmental and internal contexts. Crosstalk provides robustness to the immune system but also drives specificity of induced defense responses against the plethora of biotic interactors. Recent advances in dry-lab and wet-lab techniques have greatly enhanced our understanding of the broad-scale effects of hormone crosstalk on immune network functioning and have revealed underlying principles of crosstalk mechanisms. Molecular studies have demonstrated that hormone crosstalk is modulated at multiple levels of regulation, such as by affecting protein stability, gene transcription and hormone homeostasis. These new insights into hormone crosstalk regulation of plant defense are reviewed here, with a focus on crosstalk acting on the jasmonic acid pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana, highlighting the transcription factors MYC2 and ORA59 as major targets for modulation by other hormones.
