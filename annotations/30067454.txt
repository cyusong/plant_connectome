Changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in cytosol ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>C</sub>) or nucleus ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>N</sub>) may play some vital roles in plants under hypoosmotic shock (Hypo-OS). Here, we observed that Hypo-OS induces biphasic increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>C</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>N</sub> in two tobacco cell lines (BY-2) expressing apoaequorin either in the cytosol or in the nucleus. Both [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>C</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>N</sub> were sensitively modulated by the inhibitors of calmodulin and protein kinases, supporting the view that calmodulin suppresses the 1<sup>st</sup> peaks and and protein kinases enhance 2<sup>nd</sup> peaks in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>C</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>N</sub>. Data also suggested that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> events depend on the internal and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> sources, respectively.

Ca<sup>2+</sup>: !induces! biphasic increases
calmodulin: !suppresses! 1st peak
protein kinases: !enhance! 2nd peak
internal Ca<sup>2+</sup>: !sources! 1st event
extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>: !sources! 2nd event
