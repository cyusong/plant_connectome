Plant fertilization involves both an egg cell, which fuses with a sperm cell, and synergid cells, which guide pollen tubes for sperm cell delivery. Therefore, egg and synergid cell functional specifications are prerequisites for successful fertilization. However, how the egg and synergid cells, referred to as the "egg apparatus," derived from one mother cell develop into distinct cell types remains an unanswered question. In this report, we show that the final position of the nuclei in female gametophyte determines the cell fate of the egg apparatus. We established a live imaging system to visualize the dynamics of nuclear positioning and cell identity establishment in the female gametophyte. We observed that free nuclei should migrate to a specific position before egg apparatus specialization. Artificial changing in the nuclear position on disturbance of the actin cytoskeleton, either in vitro or in vivo, could reset the cell fate of the egg apparatus. We also found that nuclei of the same origin moved to different positions and then showed different cell identities, whereas nuclei of different origins moved to the same position showed the same cell identity, indicating that the final positions of the nuclei, rather than specific nucleus lineage, play critical roles in the egg apparatus specification. Furthermore, the active auxin level was higher in the egg cell than in synergid cells. Auxin transport inhibitor could decrease the auxin level in egg cells and impair egg cell identity, suggesting that directional and accurate auxin distribution likely acts as a positional cue for egg apparatus specialization.
