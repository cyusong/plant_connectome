['16139211', 'The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is a pluripotent group of cells that gives rise  to the aerial parts of higher plants. Class-I KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX)  transcription factors promote meristem function partly through repression of  biosynthesis of the growth regulator gibberellin (GA). However, regulation of GA  activity cannot fully account for KNOX action. Here, we show that KNOX function  is also mediated by cytokinin (CK), a growth regulator that promotes cell  division and meristem function. We demonstrate that KNOX activity is sufficient  to rapidly activate both CK biosynthetic gene expression and a SAM-localized  CK-response regulator. We also show that CK signaling is necessary for SAM  function in a weak hypomorphic allele of the KNOX gene SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM).  Additionally, we provide evidence that a combination of constitutive GA signaling  and reduced CK levels is detrimental to SAM function. Our results indicate that  CK activity is both necessary and sufficient for stimulating GA catabolic gene  expression, thus reinforcing the low-GA regime established by KNOX proteins in  the SAM. We propose that KNOX proteins may act as general orchestrators of  growth-regulator homeostasis at the shoot apex of Arabidopsis by simultaneously  activating CK and repressing GA biosynthesis, thus promoting meristem activity.', '2005 Sep 6', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2005.07.023', 'Tsiantis']
