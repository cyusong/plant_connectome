ROP GTPases (Rho-related GTPases from plant), a unique subgroup of the Rho family in plants, is a group of key regulators of different signaling pathways controlling plant growth and development, cell polarity and differentiation, and plant response against biotic and abiotic stresses. The present study determined the potential regulatory mechanism of potato ROP GTPase (StRac1) against Phytophthora infestans (P. infestans) infection. Protein secondary structure analysis indicated that StRAC1 is a Rho GTPase. The expression level of StRac1 was variable in different tissues of potato, with the highest expression in young leaves of both Shepody and Hutou potato varieties. After challenging with P. infestans, the expression level of StRac1was higher in resistance varieties Zihuabai and Longshu 7 than in susceptible varieties Shepody and Desiree. StRAC1 fusion with GFP subcellularly localized at the plasma membrane (PM) in tobacco epidermal cells. The potato with transient or stable over-expression of CA-StRac1 (constitutively active form of StRac1)exhibited a dramatic enhancement of its resistance against P. infestans infections. The increased resistance level in transgenic potato was accompanied with elevated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels. Importantly, silencing StRac1 via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in potato resulted in higher susceptibility to P. infestans infection than in control plants. In summary, our data reveal that StRac1 regulates potato resistance against P. infestans via positively modulating the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
