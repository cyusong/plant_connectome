MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that regulate gene expression by guiding target mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition. MiRNAs can have large-scale regulatory effects on development and stress response in plants. To test whether miRNAs play roles in regulating response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress in wheat, by using Solexa high-throughput sequencing we cloned the small RNA from wheat leaves infected by preponderant physiological strain Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici (Egt) or by heat stress treatment. A total of 153 miRNAs were identified, which belong to 51 known and 81 novel miRNA families. We found that 24 and 12 miRNAs were responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress, respectively. We further predicted that 149 target genes were potentially regulated by the novel wheat miRNA. Our results indicated that diverse set of wheat miRNAs were responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress and could function in wheat responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses.
