['23460027', 'Oral ingestion of plant-expressed double stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers target  gene suppression in insect. An important step of this process is the transmission  of dsRNA from plant to midgut cells. Insect peritrophic matrix (PM) presents a  barrier that prevents large molecules from entering midgut cells. Here, we show  that uptake of plant cysteine proteases, such as GhCP1 from cotton (Gossypium  hirsutum) and AtCP2 from Arabidopsis, by cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera)  larvae resulted in attenuating the PM. When GhCP1 or AtCP2 pre-fed larvae were  transferred to gossypol-containing diet, the bollworm accumulated higher content  of gossypol in midgut. Larvae previously ingested GhCP1 or AtCP2 were more  susceptible to infection by Dendrolimus punctatus cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus  (DpCPV), a dsRNA virus. Furthermore, the pre-fed larvae exhibited enhanced RNAi  effects after ingestion of the dsRNA-expressing plant. The bollworm P450 gene  CYP6AE14 is involved in the larval tolerance to gossypol; cotton plants producing  dsRNA of CYP6AE14 (dsCYP6AE14) were more resistant to bollworm feeding (Mao et  al. in Transgenic Res 20:665-673, 2011). We found that cotton plants harboring  both 35S:dsCYP6AE14 and 35S:GhCP1 were better protected from bollworm than either  of the single-transgene lines. Our results demonstrate that plant cysteine  proteases, which have the activity of increasing PM permeability, can be used to  improve the plant-mediated RNAi against herbivorous insects.', '2013 Sep', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-013-0030-7', 'Chen']
