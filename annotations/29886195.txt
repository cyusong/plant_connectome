Cottonseed oil accumulated dramatically from 20 days post-anthesis (DPA) to 30 DPA in Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). To reveal the gene network of oil accumulation and fatty acid composition in developing embryos, embryos at 10, 20 and 30 DPA in cottonseed were sampled and used for transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). In total, 8629, 7891, and 12,555 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the comparison sets of '20 DPA vs 10 DPA', '30 DPA vs 20 DPA', and '30 DPA vs 10 DPA', respectively. The gene network highlighted the dynamic expression profiles of oil accumulation in fatty acid (FA) synthesis, FA desaturation, and triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis. WRI1 and NF-YB6 were suggested elite transcription factors in regulating lipid metabolism. Compared with the gene expression levels in developing seeds, GhPDAT was highly expressed and might play a more important role than GhDGAT in transforming diacylglycerol to TAG in cotton. Expression patterns of 12 FA-biosynthesis-related genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method. To reveal the reason for the high content of linoleic acid (C18:2) in cottonseed oil, we carried out a comparative analysis of gene expression levels in Upland cotton, rapeseed (Brassica napus), and oleaster (Olea europaea). Compared with in rapeseed and oleaster, GhFAD2 genes were up-regulated and GhFAD3 genes down-regulated in cottonseed, taking into account the relative high amount of C18:2 but low content of linolenic acid (C18:3) in Upland cotton. The present study offers new information to interpret the mechanism of the FA biosynthesis network and to alter FA composition in cotton breeding projects.
