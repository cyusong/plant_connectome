As a member of the CLAVATA3 (CLV3)/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) family, the dodecapeptide tracheary element differentiation inhibitory factor (TDIF) has a major impact on vascular development in plants. However, the influence of polymorphisms in the TDIF peptide motif on activity remains poorly understood. The model plant, <i>Arabidopsis</i> provides a fast and effective tool for assaying the activity of <i>TDIF</i> homologs. Five <i>TDIF</i> homologs from a group of 93 <i>CLE</i> genes in switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>), a perennial biomass crop, named <i>PvTDIF-like</i> (<i>PvTDIFL</i>) genes were studied. The expression levels of <i>PvTDIFL1, PvTDIFL3</i> <sup><i>MR</i>3</sup>, and <i>PvTDIFL3</i> <sup><i>MR</i>2</sup> were relatively high and all of them were expressed at the highest levels in the rachis of switchgrass. The precursor proteins for PvTDIFL1, PvTDIFL3<sup>MR3</sup>, and PvTDIFL3<sup>MR2</sup> contained one, three, and two TDIFL motifs, respectively. Treatments with exogenous PvTDIFL peptides increased the number of stele cells in the hypocotyls of <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings, with the exception of PvTDIFL_4p. Heterologous expression of <i>PvTDIFL1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> strongly inhibited plant growth, increased cell division in the vascular tissue of the hypocotyl, and disrupted the cellular organization of the hypocotyl. Although heterologous expression of <i>PvTDIFL3</i> <sup><i>MR</i>3</sup> and <i>PvTDIFL3</i> <sup><i>MR</i>2</sup> also affected plant growth and vascular development, PvTDIFL activity was not enhanced by the multiple TDIFL motifs encoded by <i>PvTDIFL3</i> <sup><i>MR</i>3</sup> and <i>PvTDIFL3</i> <sup><i>MR</i>2</sup>. These data indicate that in general, PvTDIFLs are functionally similar to <i>Arabidopsis</i> TDIF but that the processing and activities of the PvTDIFL peptides are more complex.
