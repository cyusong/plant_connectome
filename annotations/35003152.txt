Plasma membrane proton-ATPase (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) is a primary H<sup>+</sup> transporter that consumes ATP <i>in vivo</i> and is a limiting factor in the blue light-induced stomatal opening signaling pathway. It was recently reported that manipulation of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in stomatal guard cells and other tissues greatly improved leaf photosynthesis and plant growth. In this report, we review and discuss the function of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in the context of the promotion and upregulation H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase strategy, including associated principles pertaining to enhanced stomatal opening, environmental plasticity, and potential applications in crops and nanotechnology. We highlight the great potential of the promotion and upregulation H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase strategy, and explain why it may be applied in many crops in the future.
