Antioxidant enzymatic responses in Citrus leaves under Cu-induced stress depends on rootstock genotypes. However, there is a lack of information about how woody plants recover growth capacity after exposure to elevated Cu and whether growth is affected by the redistribution of the metal to new vegetative parts and consequently whether photosynthesis is affected. Therefore, the biomass of plants and Cu concentrations in new leaf flushes were determined in young citrus trees grafted onto contrasting rootstocks [Swingle citrumelo (SW) and Rangpur lime (RL)]. Photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll fluorescence and antioxidant enzymatic systems were evaluated in plants previously grown in nutrient solution with Cu varying from low to high levels and with no added Cu. Both rootstocks exhibited reduced plant growth under Cu toxicity. However, trees grafted onto RL exhibited better growth recovery after Cu excess, which was dependent on the modulation of antioxidant enzyme activities in roots and leaves that maintained the integrity of the photosynthetic apparatus. In contrast, plants grafted onto SW exhibited a lower photosynthetic rate at the lowest available Cu concentration. Although the highest accumulation of Cu occurred in citrus roots, the redistribution of the nutrient to new vegetative parts was proportional to the Cu concentration in the roots.
