C<sub>2</sub> photosynthesis is a carbon concentrating mechanism that can increase net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation by capturing, concentrating and re-assimilating CO<sub>2</sub> released by photorespiration. Empirical and modelling studies indicate that C<sub>2</sub> plants assimilate more carbon than C<sub>3</sub> plants under high temperature, bright light, and low CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. I argue that engineering C<sub>2</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crops is a promising approach to improve photosynthetic performance under these - and temporally heterogeneous - environments, and review the modifications that may re-create a C<sub>2</sub> phenotype in C<sub>3</sub> plants. Although a C<sub>2</sub> engineering program would encounter many of the same challenges faced by C<sub>4</sub> engineering programmes, the simpler leaf anatomical requirements make C<sub>2</sub> engineering a feasible approach to improve crops in the medium term.
