The chloroplast ATP synthase produces the ATP needed for photosynthesis and plant growth. The trans-membrane flow of protons through the ATP synthase rotates an oligomeric assembly of c subunits, the c-ring. The ion-to-ATP ratio in rotary F1Fo-ATP synthases is defined by the number of c-subunits in the rotor c-ring. Engineering the c-ring stoichiometry is therefore a possible route to manipulate ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase and hence photosynthetic efficiency in plants. Here we describe the construction of a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) chloroplast atpH (chloroplastic ATP synthase subunit c gene) mutant in which the c-ring stoichiometry was increased from 14 to 15 c-subunits. Although the abundance of the ATP synthase was decreased to 25% of wild-type (WT) levels, the mutant lines grew as well as WT plants and photosynthetic electron transport remained unaffected. To synthesise the necessary ATP for growth, we found that the contribution of the membrane potential to the proton motive force was enhanced to ensure a higher proton flux via the c15-ring without unwanted low pH-induced feedback inhibition of electron transport. Our work opens avenues to manipulate plant ion-to-ATP ratios with potentially beneficial consequences for photosythesis.
