A novel QTL (qSCN-PL10) for SCN resistance and related candidate genes were identified in the soybean variety Pingliang xiaoheidou, and plant basal immunity seems to contribute to the SCN resistance. Soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is one of the most devastating soybean pests worldwide. The development of host plant resistance represents an effective strategy to control SCN. However, owing to the lack of diversity of resistance genes in soybean varieties, further investigation is necessary to identify new SCN resistance genes. By analyzing the resistance phenotypes of soybean variety Pingliang xiaoheidou (Pingliang, ZDD 11047), we found that it exhibited the different resistance phenotypes from PI 88788 and Peking varieties. Because Pingliang variety contains the Rhg1-a (low copy) haplotype and lacks the resistant Rhg4 haplotype, novel quantitative trait locus might account for their SCN resistance. After sequencing parental lines (Magellan and Pingliang) and 200 F<sub>2:3</sub> progenies, a high-density genetic map was constructed using the specific length amplified fragment sequencing method and qSCN-PL10 was identified as a novel locus for SCN resistance. Candidate genes were predicted by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in the qSCN-PL10 locus region. The RNA-seq analysis performed also indicated that plant basal immunity plays an important role in the resistance of Pingliang to SCN. These results lay a foundation for the use of marker-assisted breeding to enhance the resistance to SCN.
