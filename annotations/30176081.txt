In angiosperms, such as Arabidopsis and barley, the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex associates with two copies of photosystem I (PSI) supercomplex to form an NDH-PSI supercomplex for the stabilization of the NDH complex. Two linker proteins, Lhca5 and Lhca6, are members of the light-harvesting complex I (LHCI) family and mediate this supercomplex formation. The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha has branched from the basal land plant lineage and has neither Lhca5 nor Lhca6. Consequently, the NDH complex does not form a supercomplex with PSI in this plant. The Lhca6 gene does not seem to exist also in the moss Physcomitrella patens (Physcomitrella). Conversely, the Lhca5 gene has been found in Physcomitrella, although experimental evidence is still lacking for its contribution to NDH-PSI supercomplex formation as a linker. Here, we biochemically characterized the Lhca5 knock-out mutant (lhca5) in Physcomitrella. The NDH-PSI supercomplex observed in wild-type Physcomitrella was absent in the lhca5 mutant. Lhca5 protein was detected in this NDH-PSI supercomplex. Some PSI and NDH subunits were co-immunoprecipitated with Lhca5-HA. These results indicate that the Physcomitrella gene is the functional ortholog of Lhca5 reported in Arabidopsis. Between Physcomitrella and Arabidopsis, the stromal loop region is highly conserved in Lhca5 proteins but not in other LHCI members. We found that Lhca5 contributed to the stable accumulation of the NDH complex, but part of the NDH complex was still sensitive to high light intensity, even in the wild-type. We considered that angiosperms acquired another linker protein, Lhca6, to further stabilize the NDH complex.
