TCP4 and related members of class II TCP genes regulate leaf morphogenesis. We earlier demonstrated that level of TCP4 activity determines leaf size and aspects of plant maturity. The mechanism of TCP function and their target genes remain unidentified, limiting our understanding of TCP-mediated growth control. As leaf growth is influenced simultaneously by multiple phytohormones, we have studied if TCP4 interacts with any of the hormone-response pathways. Our analyses indicate a role for auxin, gibberellic acid and abscisic acid in TCP4-mediated control of leaf growth.
