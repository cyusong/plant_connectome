['15917797', 'The plant hormone auxin regulates diverse aspects of plant growth and  development. Recent studies indicate that auxin acts by promoting the degradation  of the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors through the action of the ubiquitin  protein ligase SCF(TIR1). The nature of the signalling cascade that leads to this  effect is not known. However, recent studies indicate that the auxin receptor and  other signalling components involved in this response are soluble factors. Using  an in vitro pull-down assay, we demonstrate that the interaction between  transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) and Aux/IAA proteins does not require  stable modification of either protein. Instead auxin promotes the  Aux/IAA-SCF(TIR1) interaction by binding directly to SCF(TIR1). We further show  that the loss of TIR1 and three related F-box proteins eliminates saturable auxin  binding in plant extracts. Finally, TIR1 synthesized in insect cells binds  Aux/IAA proteins in an auxin-dependent manner. Together, these results indicate  that TIR1 is an auxin receptor that mediates Aux/IAA degradation and  auxin-regulated transcription.', '2005 May 26', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature03543', 'Estelle']
