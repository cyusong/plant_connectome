We previously identified three Avr9/Cf-9 Rapidly Elicited (ACRE) genes essential for Cf-9- and Cf-4-dependent hypersensitive response (HR) production in Nicotiana benthamiana. Two of them encode putative E3 ubiquitin ligase components. This led us to investigate other ACRE genes associated with the ubiquitination pathway. ACRE74 encodes a U-box E3 ligase homolog, highly related to parsley (Petroselinum crispum) CMPG1 and Arabidopsis thaliana PLANT U-BOX20 (PUB20) and PUB21 proteins, and was called Nt CMPG1. Transcript levels of Nt CMPG1 and the homologous tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Cmpg1 are induced in Cf9 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and Cf9 tomato after Avr9 elicitation. Tobacco CMPG1 possesses in vitro E3 ligase activity. N. benthamiana plants silenced for Nt CMPG1 show reduced HR after Cf-9/Avr9 elicitation, while overexpression of Nt CMPG1 induces a stronger HR in Cf9 tobacco plants after Avr9 infiltration. In tomato, silencing of Cmpg1 decreased resistance to Cladosporium fulvum. Overexpression of epitope-tagged tobacco CMPG1 mutated in the U-box domain confers a dominant-negative phenotype. We also show that Nt CMPG1 is involved in the Pto/AvrPto and Inf1 responses. In summary, we show that the E3 ligase Nt CMPG1 is essential for plant defense and disease resistance.
