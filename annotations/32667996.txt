Root architecture is a promising breeding target for developing resource-efficient crops. Breeders and plant physiologists have called for root ideotypes that have narrow, deep root systems for improved water and nitrate capture, or wide, shallower root systems for better uptake of less mobile topsoil nutrients such as phosphorus. Yet evidence of relationships between root architecture and crop yield is limited. Many studies focus on the response to a single constraint, despite the fact that crops are frequently exposed to multiple soil constraints. For example, in dryland soils under no-till management, topsoil nutrient stratification is an emergent profile characteristic, leading to spatial separation of water and nutrients as the soil profile dries. This results in spatio-temporal trade-offs between efficient resource capture and pre-defined root ideotypes developed to counter a single constraint. We believe there is need to identify and better understand trade-offs involved in the efficient capture of multiple, spatially disjunct soil resources. Additionally, how these trade-offs interact with genotype (root architecture), environment (soil constraints), and management (agronomy) are critical unknowns. We argue that identifying root traits that enable efficient capture of multiple soil resources under fluctuating environmental constraints is a key step towards meeting the challenges of global food security.
