Nitrogen, an essential macronutrient for plants, regulates many aspects of plant growth and development. Nitrate is one of the major forms of nitrogen taken up by plants from the soil. Nitrate and nitrogen have been reported to regulate flowering; while some studies have shown that lower nitrate/nitrogen promoted flowering, others have reported the opposite trend. To elucidate how nitrate/nitrogen affects flowering, we reviewed the existing literature and conducted experiments to examine flowering time under a wide range of nitrate concentrations using two growth systems. From the literature review and our experiments, we established that differing nitrate availability results in a U-shaped flowering curve, with an optimal concentration of nitrate facilitating flowering and concentrations above or below this optimal concentration delaying flowering. The role of nitrate and nitrogen in regulating flowering has been elucidated by several transcriptomic and mutant studies, which have suggested close interactions between nitrate/nitrogen, phosphate, the circadian clock, photosynthesis, and, potentially, hormones. We discuss several possible molecular mechanisms underlying the U-shaped flowering response.
