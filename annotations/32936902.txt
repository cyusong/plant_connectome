In plants, 3´,5´-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an important second messenger with varied functions; however, only a few adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that synthesize cAMP have been identified. Moreover, the biological roles of ACs/cAMP in response to stress remain largely unclear. In this study, we used quantitative proteomics techniques to identify a maize heat-induced putative disease-resistance RPP13-like protein 3 (ZmRPP13-LK3), which has three conserved catalytic AC centres. The AC activity of ZmRPP13-LK3 was confirmed by in vitro enzyme activity analysis, in vivo RNAi experiments, and functional complementation in the E. coli cyaA mutant. ZmRPP13-LK3 is located in the mitochondria. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that ZmRPP13-LK3 interacts with ZmABC2, a possible cAMP exporter. Under heat stress, the concentrations of ZmRPP13-LK3 and cAMP in the ABA-deficient mutant vp5 were significantly less than those in the wild-type, and treatment with ABA and an ABA inhibitor affected ZmRPP13-LK3 expression in the wild-type. Application of 8-Br-cAMP, a cAMP analogue, increased heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins in wild-type plants and alleviated heat-activated oxidative stress. Taken together, our results indicate that ZmRPP13-LK3, a new AC, can catalyse ATP for the production of cAMP and may be involved in ABA-regulated heat resistance.
