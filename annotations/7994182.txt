['7994182', 'The first committed step in the gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic pathway is the  conversion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) through copalyl pyrophosphate  (CPP) to ent-kaurene catalyzed by ent-kaurene synthetases A and B. The ga1  mutants of Arabidopsis are gibberellin-responsive male-sterile dwarfs.  Biochemical studies indicate that biosynthesis of GAs in the ga1 mutants is  blocked prior to the synthesis of ent-kaurene. The GA1 locus was cloned  previously using the technique of genomic subtraction. Here, we report the  isolation of a nearly full-length GA1 cDNA clone from wild-type Arabidopsis. This  cDNA clone encodes an active protein and is able to complement the dwarf  phenotype in ga1-3 mutants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In  Escherichia coli cells that express both the Arabidopsis GA1 gene and the Erwinia  uredovora gene encoding GGPP synthase, CPP was accumulated. This result indicates  that the GA1 gene encodes the enzyme ent-kaurene synthetase A, which catalyzes  the conversion of GGPP to CPP. Subcellular localization of the GA1 protein was  studied using 35S-labeled GA1 protein and isolated pea chloroplasts. The results  showed that the GA1 protein is imported into and processed in pea chloroplasts in  vitro.', '1994 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.6.10.1509', 'Kamiya']
