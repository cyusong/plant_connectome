Group II introns are ribozymes that can excise themselves from precursor-RNA transcripts, but plant organellar group II introns have structural deviations that inhibit ribozyme activity. Therefore, splicing of these introns requires the assistance of nuclear- and/or organellar-encoded splicing factors; however, how these splicing factors function remains unclear. In this study, we report the functions and interactions of two splicing factors, PPR-SMR1 and Zm-mCSF1, in intron splicing in maize mitochondria. PPR-SMR1 is a SMR domain-containing pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein and Zm-mCSF1 is a CRM domain-containing protein, and both are targeted to mitochondria. Loss-of-function mutations in each of them severely arrests embryogenesis and endosperm development in maize. Functional analyses indicate that PPR-SMR1 and Zm-mCSF1 are required for the splicing of most mitochondrial group II introns. Among them, nad2-intron 2 and 3, and nad5-intron 1 are PPR-SMR1/Zm-mCSF1-dependent introns. Protein interaction assays suggest that PPR-SMR1 can interact with Zm-mCSF1 through its N-terminus, and that Zm-mCSF1 is self-interacting. Our findings suggest that PPR-SMR1, a novel splicing factor, acts in the splicing of multiple group II introns in maize mitochondria, and the protein-protein interaction between it and Zm-mCSF1 might allow the formation of large macromolecular splicing complexes.
