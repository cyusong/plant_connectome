Ordered collections of Arabidopsis thaliana lines containing mapped T-DNA insertions have become an important resource for plant scientists performing genetic studies. Previous reports have indicated that T-DNA insertion lines can have chromosomal translocations associated with the T-DNA insertion site, but the prevalence of these rearrangements has not been well documented. To determine the frequency with which translocations are present in a widely-used collection of T-DNA insertion lines, we analyzed 64 independent lines from the Salk T-DNA mutant collection. Chromosomal translocations were detected in 12 of the 64 lines surveyed (19%). Two assays were used to screen the T-DNA lines for translocations: pollen viability and genome-wide genetic mapping. Although the measurement of pollen viability is an indirect screen for the presence of a translocation, all 11 of the T-DNA lines showing an abnormal pollen phenotype were found to contain a translocation when analyzed using genetic mapping. A normal pollen phenotype does not, however, guarantee the absence of a translocation. We observed one T-DNA line with normal pollen that nevertheless had a translocation based on genetic mapping results. One additional phenomenon that we observed through our genetic mapping experiments was that the T-DNA junctions on the 5'- and 3'-sides of a targeted gene can genetically separate from each other in some cases. Two of the lines in our survey displayed this 'T-DNA borders separate' phenomenon. Experimental procedures for efficiently screening T-DNA lines for the presence of chromosomal abnormalities are presented and discussed.
