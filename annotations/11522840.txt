['11522840', 'Plant orthologs of the yeast sucrose non-fermenting (Snf1) kinase and mammalian  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) represent an emerging class of important  regulators of metabolic and stress signalling. The catalytic alpha-subunits of  plant Snf1-related kinases (SnRKs) interact in the yeast two-hybrid system with  different proteins that share conserved domains with the beta- and gamma-subunits  of Snf1 and AMPKs. However, due to the lack of a robust technique allowing the  detection of protein interactions in plant cells, it is unknown whether these  proteins indeed occur in SnRK complexes in vivo. Here we describe a  double-labelling technique, using intron-tagged hemagglutinin (HA) and c-Myc  epitope sequences, which provides a simple tool for co-immunopurification of  interacting proteins expressed in Agrobacterium-transformed Arabidopsis cells.  This generally applicable plant protein interaction assay was used to demonstrate  that AKINbeta2, a plant ortholog of conserved Snf1/AMPK beta-subunits, forms  different complexes with the catalytic alpha-subunits of Arabidopsis SnRK protein  kinases AKIN10 and AKIN11 in vivo.', '2001 Sep 1', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/29.17.3685', 'Koncz']
