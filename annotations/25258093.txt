Cultivated soybean (Glycine max) experienced a severe genetic bottleneck during its domestication and a further loss in diversity during its subsequent selection. Here, a panel of 65 wild (G. soja) and 353 cultivated accessions was genotyped at 552 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci to search for signals of selection during and after domestication. The wild and cultivated populations were well differentiated from one another. Application of the Fst outlier test revealed 64 loci showing evidence for selection. Of these, 35 related to selection during domestication, while the other 29 likely gradually became monomorphic as a result of prolonged selection during post domestication. Two of the SNP locus outliers were associated with testa color. Identifying genes controlling domestication-related traits is important for maintaining the diversity of crops. SNP locus outliers detected by a combined forward genetics and population genetics approach can provide markers with utility for the conservation of wild accessions and for trait improvement in the cultivated genepool.
