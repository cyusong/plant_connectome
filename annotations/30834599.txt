['30834599', 'Telomerase maturation and recruitment to telomeres is regulated by several  telomerase- and telomere-associated proteins. Among a number of proteins, human  Pontin and Reptin play critical roles in telomerase biogenesis. Here we  characterized plant orthologues of Pontin and Reptin, RuvBL1 and RuvBL2a,  respectively, and show association of Arabidopsis thaliana RuvBL1 (AtRuvBL1) with  the catalytic subunit of telomerase (AtTERT) in the nucleolus in vivo. In  contrast to mammals, interactions between AtTERT and AtRuvBL proteins in  A. thaliana are not direct and they are rather mediated by one of the Arabidopsis  thaliana Telomere Repeat Binding (AtTRB) proteins. We further show that plant  orthologue of dyskerin, named AtCBF5, is indirectly associated with AtTRB  proteins but not with the AtRuvBL proteins in the plant nucleus/nucleolus, and  interacts with the Protection of telomere 1 (AtPOT1a) in the nucleolus or  cytoplasmic foci. Our genome-wide phylogenetic analyses identify orthologues in  RuvBL protein family within the plant kingdom. Dysfunction of AtRuvBL genes in  heterozygous T-DNA insertion A. thaliana mutants results in reduced telomerase  activity and indicate the involvement of AtRuvBL in plant telomerase biogenesis.', '2019 Apr', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14306', 'ORCID:']
