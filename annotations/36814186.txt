Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) catalyzes the first step of carbon fixation performed by photosynthetic organisms. Form I of this enzyme found in plants and cyanobacteria is composed of eight large (RbcL) and eight small (RbcS) subunits. To form a functional enzyme, Rubisco subunits need to be properly folded, with the assistance of cellular chaperone machinery, and consecutively assembled in a strictly orchestrated manner, with the help of multiple auxiliary factors. In recent years, multiple Rubisco assembly chaperones and their function in enzyme biogenesis have been extensively characterized. Little is known about the potential specialized factors involved in Rubisco subunits folding at the pre-chaperonin stage, yet this knowledge is greatly needed for the fast and efficient testing of new Rubisco variants.Synechococcus sp. PCC 6803 Rubisco shows limited solubility and a lack of assembly in the Escherichia coli expression system. In this study, we aim to identify which additional chaperones are necessary and sufficient in sustaining the heterologous assembly of native Rubisco. Our findings prove that upon the introduction of Synechocystis DnaK2 to the E. coli system, RbcL is produced in soluble form. The addition of specific DnaJ (Sll1384) enhances this effect. We explain these combined effects based on binding constancies, measured for particular partners in vitro, as well as our analysis of the putative tertiary structure of the proteins. Our results have potential implications for Rubisco engineering.
