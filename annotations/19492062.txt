['19492062', 'NSP-interacting kinase (NIK1) is a receptor-like kinase identified as a virulence  target of the begomovirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP). We found that NIK1  undergoes a stepwise pattern of phosphorylation within its activation-loop domain  (A-loop) with distinct roles for different threonine residues. Mutations at  Thr-474 or Thr-468 impaired autophosphorylation and were defective for kinase  activation. In contrast, a mutation at Thr-469 did not impact autophosphorylation  and increased substrate phosphorylation, suggesting an inhibitory role for  Thr-469 in kinase function. To dissect the functional significance of these  results, we used NSP-expressing virus infection as a mechanism to interfere with  wild type and mutant NIK1 action in plants. The NIK1 knockout mutant shows  enhanced susceptibility to virus infections, a phenotype that could be  complemented with ectopic expression of a 35S-NIK1 or 35S-T469A NIK1 transgenes.  However, ectopic expression of an inactive kinase or the 35S-T474A NIK1 mutant  did not reverse the enhanced susceptibility phenotype of knockout lines,  demonstrating that Thr-474 autophosphorylation was needed to transduce a defense  response to geminiviruses. Furthermore, mutations at Thr-474 and Thr-469 residues  antagonistically affected NIK-mediated nuclear relocation of the downstream  effector rpL10. These results establish that NIK1 functions as an authentic  defense receptor as it requires activation to elicit a defense response. Our data  also suggest a model whereby phosphorylation-dependent activation of a plant  receptor-like kinase enables the A-loop to control differentially auto- and  substrate phosphorylation.', '2009 Jun 3', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0005781', 'Fontes']
