In the presence of abscisic acid or environmental stress, activated SnRK2s transiently phosphorylate Raptor1B, a regulatory component of the TOR complex, to inhibit plant growth. To examine such transient interactions between a kinase and its substrate, comprehensive genetic or biochemistry evidence is more conclusive than a single negative co-immunoprecipitation test.

SnRK2s: !phosphorylate! Raptor1B
abscisic acid/environmental stress: !activates! SnRK2s
TOR complex: !regulates by! Raptor1B
genetic/biochemistry evidence: !more conclusive than! co-immunoprecipitation test
