Establishing <i>Lupinus mutabilis</i> as a protein and oil crop requires improved varieties adapted to EU climates. The genetic regulation of strategic breeding traits, including plant architecture, growing cycle length and yield, is unknown. This study aimed to identify associations between 16 669 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 9 agronomic traits on a panel of 223 <i>L. mutabilis</i> accessions, grown in four environments, by applying a genome wide association study (GWAS). Seven environment-specific QTLs linked to vegetative yield, plant height, pods number and flowering time, were identified as major effect QTLs, being able to capture 6 to 20% of the phenotypic variation observed in these traits. Furthermore, two QTLs across environments were identified for flowering time on chromosome 8. The genes <i>FAF</i>, <i>GAMYB</i> and <i>LNK</i>, regulating major pathways involved in flowering and growth habit, as well as <i>GA30X1</i>, <i>BIM1</i>, <i>Dr1</i>, <i>HDA15</i>, <i>HAT3</i>, interacting with these pathways in response to hormonal and environmental cues, were prosed as candidate genes. These results are pivotal to accelerate the development of <i>L. mutabilis</i> varieties adapted to European cropping conditions by using marker-assisted selection (MAS), as well as to provide a framework for further functional studies on plant development and phenology in this species.
