A new imaging platform was constructed to analyze drought-tolerant traits of rice. Rice was used to quantify drought phenotypes through image-based parameters and analyzing tools. Climate change has increased the frequency and severity of drought, which limits crop production worldwide. Developing new cultivars with increased drought tolerance and short breeding cycles is critical. However, achieving this goal requires phenotyping a large number of breeding populations in a short time and in an accurate manner. Novel cutting-edge technologies such as those based on remote sensors are being applied to solve this problem. In this study, new technologies were applied to obtain and analyze imaging data and establish efficient screening platforms for drought tolerance in rice using the drought-tolerant mutant osphyb. Red-Green-Blue images were used to predict plant area, color, and compactness. Near-infrared imaging was used to determine the water content of rice, infrared was used to assess plant temperature, and fluorescence was used to examine photosynthesis efficiency. DroughtSpotter technology was used to determine water use efficiency, plant water loss rate, and transpiration rate. The results indicate that these methods can detect the difference between tolerant and susceptible plants, suggesting their value as high-throughput phenotyping methods for short breeding cycles as well as for functional genetic studies of tolerance to drought stress.
