Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are now recognized as important regulators of plant developmental programs and recent work on tip-growing systems has revealed a central role for the NADPH oxidases in generating such developmentally important ROS. Tip-growing cells have also shown that the functions of cytosolic ROS, acting as regulators of activities such as ion channel gating, are closely linked to those of ROS produced to the apoplast, where they act to modulate cell wall properties. Thus, coordination of ROS production and their activities between compartments is emerging as an important theme in our understanding of how growth and developmental programs are integrated.
