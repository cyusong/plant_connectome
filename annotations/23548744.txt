['23548744', 'PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) is a key basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor of Arabidopsis thaliana that negatively regulates light  responses, repressing chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and  photomorphogenesis in the dark. However, the mechanism for the PIF3-mediated  transcription regulation remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that  the REDUCED POTASSIUM DEPENDENCY3/HISTONE DEACETYLASE1-type histone deacetylase  HDA15 directly interacted with PIF3 in vivo and in vitro. Genome-wide  transcriptome analysis revealed that HDA15 acts mainly as a transcriptional  repressor and negatively regulates chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis  gene expression in etiolated seedlings. HDA15 and PIF3 cotarget to the genes  involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis in the dark and repress  gene expression by decreasing the acetylation levels and RNA Polymerase  II-associated transcription. The binding of HDA15 to the target genes depends on  the presence of PIF3. In addition, PIF3 and HDA15 are dissociated from the target  genes upon exposure to red light. Taken together, our results indicate that PIF3  associates with HDA15 to repress chlorophyll biosynthetic and photosynthetic  genes in etiolated seedlings.', '2013 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.109710', 'Wu']
