Photosystem I (PSI), a large protein complex located in the thylakoid membrane, mediates the final step in light-driven electron transfer to the stromal electron carrier protein ferredoxin (Fd). Here, we report the first structural description of the PSI-Fd complex from Thermosynechococcus elongatus. The trimeric PSI complex binds three Fds in a non-equivalent manner. While each is recognized by a PSI protomer in a similar orientation, the distances between Fds and the PSI redox centres differ. Fd binding thus entails loss of the exact three-fold symmetry of the PSI's soluble subunits, inducing structural perturbations which are transferred to the lumen through PsaF. Affinity chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of PSI-Fd complexes support the existence of two different Fd-binding states, with one Fd being more tightly bound than the others. We propose a dynamic structural basis for productive complex formation, which supports fast electron transfer between PSI and Fd.
