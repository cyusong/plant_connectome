The native resistance of most plant species against a wide variety of pathogens is known as non-host resistance (NHR), which confers durable protection to plant species. Only a few pathogens or parasites can successfully cause diseases. NHR is polygenic and appears to be linked with basal plant resistance, a form of elicited protection. Sensing of pathogens by plants is brought about through the recognition of invariant pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that trigger downstream defense signaling pathways. Race-specific resistance, (R)-gene mediated resistance, has been extensively studied and reviewed, while our knowledge of NHR has advanced only recently due to the improved access to excellent model systems. The continuum of the cell wall (CW) and the CW-plasma membrane (PM)-cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in perceiving external cues and activating defense signaling cascades during NHR. Based on the type of hypersensitive reaction (HR) triggered, NHR was classified into two types, namely type-I and type-II. Genetic analysis of Arabidopsis mutants has revealed important roles for a number of specific molecules in NHR, including the role of SNARE-complex mediated exocytosis, lipid rafts and vesicle trafficking. As might be expected, R-gene mediated resistance is found to overlap with NHR, but the extent to which the genes/pathways are common between these two forms of disease resistance is unknown. The present review focuses on the various components involved in the known mechanisms of NHR in plants with special reference to the role of CW-PM components.
