Transition to the reproductive phase, inflorescence formation and flower development are crucial elements that ensure maximum reproductive success in a plant's life cycle. To understand the regulatory mechanisms underlying correct flower development in barley (Hordeum vulgare), we characterized the multiovary 5 (mov5.o) mutant. This mutant develops abnormal flowers that exhibit mosaic floral organs typified by multiple carpels at the total or partial expense of stamens. Genetic mapping positioned mov5 on the long arm of chromosome 2H, incorporating a region that encodes HvLFY, the barley orthologue of LEAFY from Arabidopsis. Sequencing revealed that, in mov5.o plants, HvLFY contains a single amino acid substitution in a highly conserved proline residue. CRISPR-mediated knockout of HvLFY replicated the mov5.o phenotype, suggesting that HvLFY<sub>mov5</sub> represents a loss of function allele. In heterologous assays, the HvLFY<sub>mov5</sub> polymorphism influenced protein-protein interactions and affinity for a putative binding site in the promoter of HvMADS58, a C-class MADS-box gene. Moreover, molecular analysis indicated that HvLFY interacts with HvUFO and regulates the expression of floral homeotic genes including HvMADS2, HvMADS4 and HvMADS16. Other distinct changes in expression differ from those reported in the rice LFY mutants apo2/rfl, suggesting that LFY function in the grasses is modulated in a species-specific manner. This pathway provides a key entry point for the study of LFY function and multiple ovary formation in barley, as well as cereal species in general.
