Secondary cell walls (SCWs) are formed in some specific types of plant cells, providing plants with mechanical strength. During plant growth and development, formation of secondary cell walls is regulated by various developmental and environmental signals. The underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the blue light receptor <i>cryptochrome1</i> (<i>cry1</i>) mutant of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> for its SCW phenotypes. During inflorescence stem growth, SCW thickening in the vasculature was significantly affected by blue light. <i>cry1</i> plants displayed a decline of SCW thickening in fiber cells, while <i>CRY1</i> overexpression led to enhanced SCW formation. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the reduced SCW thickening was associated with repression of the <i>NST1</i>-directed transcription regulatory networks. Further analyses revealed that the expression of <i>MYC2</i>/<i>MYC4</i> that is induced by blue light activates the transcriptional network underlying SCW thickening. The activation is caused by direct binding of MYC2/MYC4 to the <i>NST1</i> promoter. This study demonstrates that SCW thickening in fiber cells is regulated by a blue light signal that is mediated through MYC2/MYC4 activation of <i>NST1</i>-directed SCW formation in Arabidopsis.
