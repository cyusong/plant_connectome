Seed dormancy and germination are complex physiological processes usually under hormonal control. Germination of seeds from many plants including switchgrass, are inhibited by ABA and promoted by NO or ROS. However, ABA apparently requires both ROS and NO as intermediates in its action, with ROS produced by membrane-bound NADPH-oxidases responsive to ABA. In switchgrass seeds, externally supplied hydrogen peroxide (ROS), but not NO will overcome ABA-imposed inhibition of germination. Stimulation of germination by external ROS can be partially blocked by NO-scavengers, suggesting that NO is required for seed germination in switchgrass as well as for ABA-induced inhibition of germination. Collectively, these data suggest that multiple mechanisms might be required to sense and respond to varying levels of ABA, NO and ROS in switchgrass seeds.
