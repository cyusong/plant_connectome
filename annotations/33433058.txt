['33433058', 'Trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is a repressive histone marker that  regulates a variety of developmental processes, including those that determine  flowering time. However, relatively little is known about the mechanism of how  H3K27me3 is recognized to regulate transcription. Here, we identified BAH  domain-containing transcriptional regulator 1 (BDT1) as an H3K27me3 reader. BDT1  is responsible for preventing flowering by suppressing the expression of  flowering genes. Mutation of the H3K27me3 recognition sites in the BAH domain  disrupted the binding of BDT1 to H3K27me3, leading to de-repression of  H3K27me3-enriched flowering genes and an early-flowering phenotype. We also found  that BDT1 interacts with a family of PHD finger-containing proteins, which we  named PHD1-6, and with CPL2, a Pol II carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase  responsible for transcriptional repression. Pull-down assays showed that the PHD  finger-containing proteins can enhance the binding of BDT1 to the H3K27me3  peptide. Mutations in all of the PHD genes caused increased expression of  flowering genes and an early-flowering phenotype. This study suggests that the  binding of BDT1 to the H3K27me3 peptide, which is enhanced by PHD proteins, is  critical for preventing early flowering.', '2021 Apr', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.13067', 'He']
