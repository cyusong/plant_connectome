Salicylic acid (SA) has long been known to be essential for basal defense and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). N-Hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP), a recently discovered plant metabolite, also plays a key role in SAR and to a lesser extent in basal resistance. Following pathogen infection, levels of both compounds are dramatically increased. Analysis of SA- or SAR-deficient mutants has uncovered how SA and NHP are biosynthesized. The completion of the SA and NHP biosynthetic pathways in Arabidopsis allowed better understanding of how they are regulated. In this review, we discuss recent progress on SA and NHP biosynthesis and their regulation in plant immunity.
