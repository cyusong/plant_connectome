<i>Phoma sorghina</i> var. <i>saccharum</i> is a fungal pathogen that causes sugarcane twisted leaf disease in China. Here, we report complete genome assemblies of the <i>Phoma sorghina</i> var. <i>saccharum</i> isolate BS2-1, generated using single-molecule real-time sequencing. We present a high-quality genome sequence of a <i>Phoma</i> isolate that was assembled into 22 contigs with an N<sub>50</sub> length of 1.92 Mb, a total length of 33.12 Mb, and a GC content of 52.12%. A total of 7,870 genes were annotated, using a combination of gene prediction tools, including 281 noncoding RNAs, 515 genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes, 2,440 genes associated with pathogen-host interactions, and 583 genes encoding secreted proteins. The complete genome sequence will be useful for understanding host-pathogen interaction and for improving disease management strategies.
