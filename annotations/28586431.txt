Flooding and drought are disadvantageous environmental conditions that induce cytosolic calcium in soybean. To explore the effects of flooding- and drought-induced increases in calcium, a gel-free/label-free proteomic analysis was performed. Cytosolic calcium was decreased by blocking calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane under both stresses. Calnexin, protein disulfide isomerase, heat shock proteins and thioredoxin were predominantly affected as the ER proteins in response to calcium, and ER-associated degradation-related proteins of HCP-like superfamily protein were up-regulated under stress exposure and then down-regulated. Glycolysis, fermentation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid metabolism were mainly induced as the types of cellular metabolism in response to calcium under both stresses. Pyruvate decarboxylase was increased and decreased under flooding and drought, respectively, and was further decreased by the reduction of cytosolic calcium; however, it was recovered by exogenous calcium under both stresses. Furthermore, pyruvate decarboxylase activity was increased under flooding, but decreased under drought. These results suggest that calcium is involved in protein folding in the ER, and ER-associated degradation might alleviate ER stress during the early stage of both stresses. Furthermore, calcium appears to modify energy metabolism, and pyruvate decarboxylase may be a key enzyme in this process under flooding and drought.
