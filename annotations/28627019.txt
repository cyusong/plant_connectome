Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) is the most important cause of maize dwarf mosaic disease. To identify maize genes responsive to SCMV infection and that may be involved in pathogenesis, a comparative proteomic analysis was performed using the first and second systemically infected leaves (termed 1 SL and 2 SL, respectively). Seventy-one differentially expressed proteins were identified in 1 SL and 2 SL upon SCMV infection. Among them, eight proteins showed the same changing patterns in both 1 SL and 2 SL. Functional annotations of regulated proteins and measurement of photosynthetic activity revealed that photosynthesis was more inhibited and defensive gene expression more pronounced in 1 SL than in 2 SL. Knockdown of regulated proteins in both 1 SL and 2 SL by a brome mosaic virus-based gene silencing vector in maize indicated that protein disulfide isomerase-like and phosphoglycerate kinase were required for optimal SCMV replication. By contrast, knockdown of polyamine oxidase (ZmPAO) significantly increased SCMV accumulation, implying that ZmPAO activity might contribute to resistance or tolerance. The results suggest that combining comparative proteomic analyses of different tissues and virus-induced gene silencing is an efficient way to identify host proteins supporting virus replication or enhancing resistance to virus infection.
