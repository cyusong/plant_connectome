RNA silencing is a major mechanism of constitutive antiviral defense in plants, mediated by a number of proteins, including the Dicer-like (DCL) and Argonaute (AGO) endoribonucleases. Both DCL and AGO protein families comprise multiple members. In particular, the AGO protein family has expanded considerably in different plant lineages, with different family members having specialized functions. Although the general mode of action of AGO proteins is well established, the properties that make different AGO proteins more or less efficient at targeting viruses are less well understood. In this report, we review methodologies used to study AGO antiviral activity and current knowledge about which AGO family members are involved in antiviral defense. In addition, we discuss what is known about the different properties of AGO proteins thought to be associated with this function.
