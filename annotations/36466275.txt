AMMONIUM TRANSPORTER/METHYLAMMONIUM PERMEASE/RHESUS (AMT) family members transport ammonium across membranes in all life domains. Plant AMTs can be categorized into AMT1 and AMT2 subfamilies. Functional studies of AMTs, particularly AMT1-type, have been conducted using model plants but little is known about the function of AMTs from crops. Sugarcane (<i>Saccharum</i> spp.) is a major bioenergy crop that requires heavy nitrogen fertilization but depends on a low carbon-footprint for competitive sustainability. Here, we identified and functionally characterized sugarcane <i>ScAMT2;1</i> by complementing ammonium uptake-defective mutants of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Reporter gene driven by the <i>ScAMT2;1</i> promoter in <i>A. thaliana</i> revealed preferential expression in the shoot vasculature and root endodermis/pericycle according to nitrogen availability and source. Arabidopsis quadruple mutant plants expressing <i>ScAMT2;1</i> driven by the CaMV35S promoter or by a sugarcane endogenous promoter produced significantly more biomass than mutant plants when grown in NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and showed more <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium uptake by roots and nitrogen translocation to shoots. In <i>A. thaliana</i>, ScAMT2;1 displayed a K<sub>m</sub> of 90.17 µM and V<sub>max</sub> of 338.99 µmoles h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> root DW. Altogether, our results suggest that ScAMT2;1 is a functional high-affinity ammonium transporter that might contribute to ammonium uptake and presumably to root-to-shoot translocation under high NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> conditions.
