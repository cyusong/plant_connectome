['19122104', 'Expression of miR398 is induced in response to copper deficiency and is involved  in the degradation of mRNAs encoding copper/zinc superoxide dismutase in  Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that SPL7 (for SQUAMOSA promoter binding  protein-like7) is essential for this response of miR398. SPL7 is homologous to  Copper response regulator1, the transcription factor that is required for  switching between plastocyanin and cytochrome c(6) in response to copper  deficiency in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. SPL7 bound directly to GTAC motifs in  the miR398 promoter in vitro, and these motifs were essential and sufficient for  the response to copper deficiency in vivo. SPL7 is also required for the  expression of multiple microRNAs, miR397, miR408, and miR857, involved in copper  homeostasis and of genes encoding several copper transporters and a copper  chaperone, indicating its central role in response to copper deficiency.  Consistent with this idea, the growth of spl7 plants was severely impaired under  low-copper conditions.', '2009 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.060137', 'Shikanai']
