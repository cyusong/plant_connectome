Accumulation of soluble carbohydrates during dehydration stress is thought to be a very important mechanism for the acquisition of desiccation tolerance. Despite the proposed importance of soluble carbohydrate accumulation (especially sucrose), nothing is known about the cellular localization of carbohydrates in desiccation-tolerant plants. The present study proposes a novel and selective method for the in situ localization of sucrose and glucose in the desiccation-tolerant plant Sporobolus stapfianus. The detection of sucrose and glucose is based on a series of coupled enzymatic reactions leading to the formation of NADH. Iodonitrotetrazolium (INT) reacts with NADH, thereby providing the red-colored insoluble INT-formazan. Stained tissue sections were immediately visualized using light microscopy. Localization of the respective sugars was site specific. Sucrose was visualized in all leaf cell types during dehydration: vascular bundles, bundle sheath cells, mesophyll cells and epidermal cells. Similarly, glucose was shown to be localized in the same leaf compartments as reported for sucrose. This is the first report that describes sucrose localization in dehydrating leaf tissues of a "resurrection" plant. We conclude that, during dehydration stress, sucrose accumulates in all viable tissues; these results are in agreement with the previously proposed theories about its function as a cellular protectant.
