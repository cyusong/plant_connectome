Vegetation stands have a heterogeneous distribution of light quality, including the red/far-red light ratio (R/FR) that informs plants about proximity of neighbors. Adequate responses to changes in R/FR are important for competitive success. How the detection and response to R/FR are spatially linked and how this spatial coordination between detection and response affects plant performance remains unresolved. We show in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Brassica nigra</i> that localized FR enrichment at the lamina tip induces upward leaf movement (hyponasty) from the petiole base. Using a combination of organ-level transcriptome analysis, molecular reporters, and physiology, we show that PIF-dependent spatial auxin dynamics are key to this remote response to localized FR enrichment. Using computational 3D modeling, we show that remote signaling of R/FR for hyponasty has an adaptive advantage over local signaling in the petiole, because it optimizes the timing of leaf movement in response to neighbors and prevents hyponasty caused by self-shading.

PIF: !induces! upward leaf movement
FR enrichment: !informs! plants about proximity of neighbors
FR enrichment: !induces! PIF-dependent spatial auxin dynamics
R/FR: !signals for! hyponasty
3D modeling: !shows! remote signaling of R/FR has adaptive advantage
