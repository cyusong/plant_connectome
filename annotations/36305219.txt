Light is a particularly important environmental cue that regulates a variety of diverse plant developmental processes, such as photomorphogenesis. Blue light promotes photomorphogenesis mainly through the activation of the photoreceptor cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). However, the mechanism underlying the CRY1-mediated regulation of growth is not fully understood. Here, we found that blue light induced N<sup>6</sup> -methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup> A) RNA modification during photomorphogenesis partially via CRY1. Cryptochrome 1 mediates blue light-induced expression of FKBP12-interacting protein 37 (FIP37), which is a component of m<sup>6</sup> A writer. Moreover, we showed that CRY1 physically interacted with FIP37 in vitro and in vivo, and mediated blue light activation of FIP37 binding to RNA. Furthermore, CRY1 and FIP37 modulated m<sup>6</sup> A on photomorphogenesis-related genes PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5, thereby accelerating the decay of their transcripts. Genetically, FIP37 repressed hypocotyl elongation under blue light, and fip37 mutation could partially rescue the short-hypocotyl phenotype of CRY1-overexpressing plants. Together, our results provide a new insight into CRY1 signal in modulating m<sup>6</sup> A methylation and stability of PIFs, and establish an essential molecular link between m<sup>6</sup> A modification and determination of photomorphogenesis in plants.
