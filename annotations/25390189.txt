Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play important roles in the stress response in both plants and microorganisms. The mycorrhizal symbiosis established between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plants can enhance plant drought tolerance, which might be closely related to the fungal MAPK response and the molecular dialogue between fungal and soybean MAPK cascades. To verify the above hypothesis, germinal Glomus intraradices (syn. Rhizophagus irregularis) spores and potted experiments were conducted. The results showed that AMF GiMAPKs with high homology with MAPKs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae had different gene expression patterns under different conditions (nitrogen starvation, abscisic acid treatment, and drought). Drought stress upregulated the levels of fungi and soybean MAPK transcripts in mycorrhizal soybean roots, indicating the possibility of a molecular dialogue between the two symbiotic sides of symbiosis and suggesting that they might cooperate to regulate the mycorrhizal soybean drought-stress response. Meanwhile, the changes in hydrogen peroxide, soluble sugar, and proline levels in mycorrhizal soybean as well as in the accelerated exchange of carbon and nitrogen in the symbionts were contributable to drought adaptation of the host plants. Thus, it can be preliminarily inferred that the interactions of MAPK signals on both sides, symbiotic fungus and plant, might regulate the response of symbiosis and, thus, improve the resistance of mycorrhizal soybean to drought stress.
