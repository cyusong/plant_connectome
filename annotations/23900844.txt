['23900844', 'In oxygenic photosynthesis, two photosystems work in tandem to harvest light  energy and generate NADPH and ATP. Photosystem II (PSII), the protein-pigment  complex that uses light energy to catalyze the splitting of water, is assembled  from its component parts in a tightly regulated process that requires a number of  assembly factors. The 2pac mutant of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii was isolated and found to have no detectable PSII activity, whereas  other components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, including  photosystem I, were still functional. PSII activity was fully restored by  complementation with the RBD1 gene, which encodes a small iron-sulfur protein  known as a rubredoxin. Phylogenetic evidence supports the hypothesis that this  rubredoxin and its orthologs are unique to oxygenic phototrophs and distinct from  rubredoxins in Archaea and bacteria (excluding cyanobacteria). Knockouts of the  rubredoxin orthologs in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and the  plant Arabidopsis thaliana were also found to be specifically affected in PSII  accumulation. Taken together, our data suggest that this rubredoxin is necessary  for normal PSII activity in a diverse set of organisms that perform oxygenic  photosynthesis.', '2013 Sep 13', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M113.487629', 'Niyogi']
