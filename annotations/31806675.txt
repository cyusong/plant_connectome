The spikelet is an inflorescence structure unique to grasses. The molecular mechanisms underlying spikelet development and evolution are unclear. In this study, we characterized three allelic recessive mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>): <i>nonstop glumes 1-1</i> (<i>nsg1-1</i>), <i>nsg1-2</i>, and <i>nsg1-3</i> In these mutants, organs such as the rudimentary glume, sterile lemma, palea, lodicule, and filament were elongated and/or widened, or transformed into lemma- and/or marginal region of the palea-like organs. <i>NSG1</i> encoded a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family and was expressed mainly in the organ primordia of the spikelet. In the <i>nsg1-1</i> mutant spikelet, <i>LHS1 DL</i>, and <i>MFO1</i> were ectopically expressed in two or more organs, including the rudimentary glume, sterile lemma, palea, lodicule, and stamen, whereas <i>G1</i> was downregulated in the rudimentary glume and sterile lemma. Furthermore, the NSG1 protein was able to bind to regulatory regions of <i>LHS1</i> and then recruit the corepressor TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEIN to repress expression by downregulating histone acetylation levels of the chromatin. The results suggest that <i>NSG1</i> plays a pivotal role in maintaining organ identities in the spikelet by repressing the expression of <i>LHS1</i>, <i>DL</i>, and <i>MFO1.</i>
