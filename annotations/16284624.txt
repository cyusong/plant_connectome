['16284624', 'In contrast to animal and fungal cells, green plant cells contain one or multiple  chloroplasts, the organelle(s) in which photosynthetic reactions take place.  Chloroplasts are believed to have originated from an endosymbiotic event and  contain DNA that codes for some of their proteins. Most chloroplast proteins are  encoded by the nuclear genome and imported with the help of sorting signals that  are intrinsic parts of the polypeptides. Here, we show that a chloroplast-located  protein in higher plants takes an alternative route through the secretory  pathway, and becomes N-glycosylated before entering the chloroplast.', '2005 Dec', 'Nat Cell Biol', '10.1038/ncb1330', 'Samuelsson']
