The coordinated distribution of inorganic phosphate (Pi) between roots and shoots is an important process that plants use to maintain Pi homeostasis. SHORT-ROOT (SHR) is well characterized for its function in root radial patterning. Here we demonstrate a role of SHR in controlling Pi allocation from root to shoot by regulating PHOSPHATE1 in the root differentiation zone. We recovered a weak mutant allele of SHR in Arabidopsis that accumulates much less Pi in the shoot and shows a constitutive Pi starvation response under Pi-sufficient conditions. In addition, Pi starvation suppresses SHR protein accumulation and releases its inhibition on the HD-ZIP III transcription factor PHB. PHB accumulates and directly binds the promoter of PHOSPHATE2 to upregulate its transcription, resulting in PHOSPHATE1 degradation in the xylem-pole pericycle cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of how plants regulate Pi translocation from roots to shoots.

SHR: !regulates! PHOSPHATE1
Pi starvation: !suppresses! SHR
PHB: !accumulates and binds! PHOSPHATE2
PHB: !upregulates! PHOSPHATE1
