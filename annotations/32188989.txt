Nitrogen (N)-fixing soybean plants use the ureides allantoin and allantoic acid as major long-distance transport forms of N, but in non-fixing, non-nodulated plants amino acids mainly serve in source-to-sink N allocation. However, some ureides are still synthesized in roots of non-fixing soybean, and our study addresses the role of ureide transport processes in those plants. In previous work, legume ureide permeases (UPSs) were identified that are involved in cellular import of allantoin and allantoic acid. Here, UPS1 from common bean was expressed in the soybean phloem, which resulted in enhanced source-to-sink transport of ureides in the transgenic plants. This was accompanied by increased ureide synthesis and elevated allantoin and allantoic acid root-to-sink transport. Interestingly, amino acid assimilation, xylem transport, and phloem partitioning to sinks were also strongly up-regulated. In addition, photosynthesis and sucrose phloem transport were improved in the transgenic plants. These combined changes in source physiology and assimilate partitioning resulted in increased vegetative growth and improved seed numbers. Overall, the results support that ureide transport processes in non-fixing plants affect source N and carbon acquisition and assimilation as well as source-to-sink translocation of N and carbon assimilates with consequences for plant growth and seed development.
