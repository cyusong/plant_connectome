Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are oxidative enzymes that convert monophenols and o-diphenols to o-quinones using molecular oxygen. The quinone products are highly reactive following tissue damage and can interact with cellular constituents and cause oxidative browning and cross-linking. The induction of PPO in some plants as a result of wounding, herbivore attack, or pathogen infection has implicated them in defense. However, PPO-like enzymes that act as specific hydroxylases, for example in lignan and pigment biosynthesis, have also been discovered. Here, we present the first genome-enabled analysis of a PPO gene family. The Populus trichocarpa genome was found to contain a minimum of nine complete PPO genes, and seven of these were characterized further. The PPO gene family includes both recently duplicated and divergent sequences that are 36-98% identical at the amino acid level. Gene expression profiling in poplar tissues and organs revealed that the PPO genes are all differentially expressed during normal development, but that only a small subset of PPO genes are significantly upregulated by wounding, methyl jasmonate or pathogen infection. Our studies also identified PtrPPO13, a novel PPO gene that is predicted to encode an N-terminal signal peptide. Transient expression of green fluorescent protein fusions demonstrated its localization to the vacuolar lumen. Together, our findings show that the poplar PPO family is diverse and is likely linked to diverse physiological functions.
