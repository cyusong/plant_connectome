The Arabidopsis gene BIG (formerly DOC1/TIR3/UMB1/ASA1) is known to encode a huge calossin-like protein that is required for polar auxin transport (PAT). Mutations at this locus, in addition to reducing PAT, can alter the sensitivity of plants to several hormones and light. The tir3-1 allele of BIG reduces the response of plants to application of the gibberellin (GA) precursors ent-kaurenoic acid and GA12 and its semidwarf phenotype is partially reversed by C19-GAs. The effects of auxin transport inhibitors (ATIs) on GA 20-oxidation was examined in wild-type and tir3-1 seedlings. 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and triiodobenzoic acid lead to overexpression of the GA-biosynthetic gene AtGA20ox1 comparable in magnitude to the overexpression observed in seedlings treated with paclobutrazol, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor. In contrast to that of AtGA20ox1, overexpression of AtGA20ox2 is pronounced only in paclobutrazol-treated Col and Ler, and is less in tir3-1 and in all NPA-treated seedlings. Thus the effects of BIG and ATIs on the expression of genes encoding GA 20-oxidases are complex, and suggest that at least in some tissues ATIs, directly or indirectly, may reduce the level of bioactive GA and/or alter GA signal transduction.
