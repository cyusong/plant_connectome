Biotic constraints, including pathogenic fungi, viruses and bacteria, herbivory insects, as well as parasitic nematodes, cause significant yield loss and quality deterioration of crops. The effect of conventional management of these biotic constraints is limited. The advances in transgenic technologies provide a direct and directional approach to improve crops for biotic resistance. More than a hundred transgenic events and hundreds of cultivars resistant to herbivory insects, pathogenic viruses, and fungi have been developed by the heterologous expression of exogenous genes and RNAi, authorized for cultivation and market, and resulted in a significant reduction in yield loss and quality deterioration. However, the exploration of transgenic improvement for resistance to bacteria and nematodes by overexpression of endogenous genes and RNAi remains at the testing stage. Recent advances in RNAi and CRISPR/Cas technologies open up possibilities to improve the resistance of crops to pathogenic bacteria and plant parasitic nematodes, as well as other biotic constraints.
