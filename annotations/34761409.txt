MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 21-24 nucleotides (nt) noncoding small RNAs ubiquitously distributed across the plant kingdom. miR482/2118, one of the conserved miRNA superfamilies originating from gymnosperms, has divergent main functions in core-angiosperms. It mainly regulates NUCLEOTIDE BINDING SITE-LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT (NBS-LRR) genes in eudicots, functioning as an essential component in plant disease resistance; in contrast, it predominantly targets numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in monocot grasses, which are vital for plant reproduction. Usually, miR482/2118 is 22-nt in length, which can trigger the production of phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) after directed cleavage. PhasiRNAs instigated from target genes of miR482/2118 enhance their roles in corresponding biological processes by cis-regulation on cognate genes and expands their function to other pathways via trans activity on different genes. This review summarizes the origin, biogenesis, conservation, and evolutionary characteristics of the miR482/2118 superfamily and delineates its diverse functions in disease resistance, plant development, stress responses, etc.
