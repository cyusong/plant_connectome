['33431870', 'Chloroplast function requires the coordinated action of nuclear- and  chloroplast-derived proteins, including several hundred nuclear-encoded  pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins that regulate plastid mRNA metabolism.  Despite their large number and importance, regulatory mechanisms controlling PPR  expression are poorly understood. Here we show that the Arabidopsis NOT4A  ubiquitin-ligase positively regulates the expression of PROTON GRADIENT  REGULATION 3 (PGR3), a PPR protein required for translating several  thylakoid-localised photosynthetic components and ribosome subunits within  chloroplasts. Loss of NOT4A function leads to a strong depletion of cytochrome  b(6)f and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complexes, as well as plastid 30 S  ribosomes, which reduces mRNA translation and photosynthetic capacity, causing  pale-yellow and slow-growth phenotypes. Quantitative transcriptome and proteome  analysis of the not4a mutant reveal it lacks PGR3 expression, and that its  molecular defects resemble those of a pgr3 mutant. Furthermore, we show that  normal plastid function is restored to not4a through transgenic PGR3 expression.  Our work identifies NOT4A as crucial for ensuring robust photosynthetic function  during development and stress-response, through promoting PGR3 production and  chloroplast translation.', '2021 Jan 11', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-020-20506-4', 'ORCID:']
