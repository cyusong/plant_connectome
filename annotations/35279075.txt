Oil palm is the most efficient oil-producing crop in the world, and the yield of palm oil is associated with embryonic development. However, a comprehensive understanding of zygotic embryo development at the molecular level remains elusive. In order to address this issue, we report the transcriptomic analysis of zygotic embryo development in oil palm, specifically focusing on regulatory genes involved in important biological pathways. In this study, three cDNA libraries were prepared from embryos at S1 (early-stage), S2 (middle-stage), and S3 (late-stage). There were 16,367, 16,500, and 18,012 genes characterized at the S1, S2, and S3 stages of embryonic development, respectively. A total of 1522, 2698, and 142 genes were differentially expressed in S1 vs S2, S1 vs S3, and S2 vs S3, respectively. Using Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis to identify key genes and pathways. In the hormone signaling pathway, genes related to auxin antagonize the output of cytokinin which regulates the development of embryo meristem. The genes related to abscisic acid negatively regulating the synthesis of gibberellin were strongly up-regulated in the mid-late stage of embryonic development. The results were reported the early synthesis and mid-late degradation of sucrose, as well as the activation of the continuous degradation pathway of temporary starch, providing the nutrients needed for differentiation of the embryonic cell. Moreover, the transcripts of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis were also abundantly accumulated in the zygotic embryos. Taken together, our research provides a new perspective on the developmental and metabolic regulation of zygotic embryo development at the transcriptional level in oil palm.

auxin: !antagonizes! cytokinin
abscisic acid: !regulates! gibberellin synthesis
sucrose: !synthesized! early
starch: !degraded! continuously
fatty acid: !synthesized! abundantly
