Root-knot nematodes are soil-borne pathogens that invade and establish feeding sites in plant roots. They have an extremely broad host range, including most vascular plants. During infection of a susceptible host, root-knot nematodes secrete molecules called effectors that help them establish an intimate interaction with the plant and, at the same time, allow them to evade or suppress plant immune responses. Despite the fact that Meloidogyne hapla is a significant pest on several food crops, no effectors have been characterized from this root-knot nematode species thus far. Using the published genome and proteome from M. hapla, we have identified and characterized two genes, MhTTL2 and Mh265. MhTTL2 encodes a predicted secreted protein containing a transthyretin-like protein domain. The expression of MhTTL2 was up-regulated during parasitic life stages of the nematode, and in situ hybridization showed that MhTTL2 was expressed in the amphids, suggesting it has a role in the nematode nervous system during parasitism. We also studied the gene Mh265. The Mh265 transcript was localized to the subventral esophageal glands. An upregulation in Mh265 expression coincided with the pre- and early-parasitic life stages of the nematode. When Mh265 was constitutively expressed in plants, it enhanced their susceptibility to nematodes. These transgenic plants were also compromised in flg22-induced callose deposition, suggesting the Mh265 is modulating plant basal immune responses.
