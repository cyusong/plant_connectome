['7592828', 'To isolate new plant genes involved in the defense against oxidative stress, an  Arabidopsis cDNA library in a yeast expression vector was transformed into a  yeast strain deficient in the YAP1 gene, which encodes a b-Zip transcription  factor and regulates general stress response in yeasts. Cells from approximately  10(5) primary transformants were subjected to a tolerance screen toward the  thiol-oxidizing drug diamide, which depletes the reduced glutathione in the cell.  Four types of Arabidopsis cDNAs were isolated. Three of these cDNAs (P1, P2, and  P4) belong to a plant zeta-crystallin family and P3 is an Arabidopsis homolog of  isoflavonoid reductases. As such, all four isolated cDNAs are homologous to NADPH  oxidoreductases. P1, P2, and P3 steady-state mRNAs accumulated rapidly in  Arabidopsis plants under various oxidative stress conditions, such as treatment  with paraquat, t-butylhydroperoxide, diamide, and menadione. The data suggested  that proteins encoded by the isolated cDNAs play a distinct role in plant  antioxidant defense and are possibly involved in NAD(P)/NAD(P)H homeostasis.', '1995 Nov 3', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.270.44.26224', 'Inze']
