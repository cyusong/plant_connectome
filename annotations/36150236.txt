Climate change adversely affects the yield and productivity of cereal crops, which consequently impacts food security. Therefore, studying stress acclimation, particularly transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological responses of cereal crops to different stresses, will provide insights into the molecular determinants underlying climate resilience. The availability of advanced tools and approaches has enabled the characterization of plants at morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels, which will lead to the identification of genomic regions regulating the stress responses at these levels. This will further facilitate using transgenic, breeding, or genome editing approaches to manipulate the identified regions (genes, alleles, or QTLs) to enhance stress resilience. Next-generation sequencing approaches have advanced the identification of causal genes and markers in the genomes through forward or reverse genetics. In this context, the review enumerates the progress of dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional and physiological responses of major cereals to climate-induced stresses. The review systematically discusses different tools and approaches available to study the response of plants to various stresses and identify the molecular determinants regulating stress-resilience. Further, the application of genomics-assisted breeding, transgene-, and targeted editing-based approaches for modulating the genetic determinants for enhanced climate resilience has been elaborated.
