['32198392', "Chlorophyll is indispensable for life on Earth. Dynamic control of chlorophyll  level, determined by the relative rates of chlorophyll anabolism and catabolism,  ensures optimal photosynthesis and plant fitness. How plants post-translationally  coordinate these two antagonistic pathways during their lifespan remains  enigmatic. Here, we show that two Arabidopsis paralogs of BALANCE of CHLOROPHYLL  METABOLISM (BCM) act as functionally conserved scaffold proteins to regulate the  trade-off between chlorophyll synthesis and breakdown. During early leaf  development, BCM1 interacts with GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 to stimulate Mg-chelatase  activity, thus optimizing chlorophyll synthesis. Meanwhile, BCM1's interaction  with Mg-dechelatase promotes degradation of the latter, thereby preventing  chlorophyll degradation. At the onset of leaf senescence, BCM2 is up-regulated  relative to BCM1, and plays a conserved role in attenuating chlorophyll  degradation. These results support a model in which post-translational regulators  promote chlorophyll homeostasis by adjusting the balance between chlorophyll  biosynthesis and breakdown during leaf development.", '2020 Mar 20', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-020-14992-9', 'Grimm']
