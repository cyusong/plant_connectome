['32499114', 'The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex, which consists of eight subunits  named COG1-COG8, is highly conserved with homologous subunits present in most  eukaryotic species. In yeast and mammalian, the COG complex has been implicated  in the tethering of retrograde intra-Golgi vesicles. Although homologs of COG  subunits have been identified in Arabidopsis, the functions of the complex and  its subunits remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we have utilized  genetic and cytologic approaches to characterize the role of the COG6 subunit. We  showed that a mutation in COG6 caused male transmission defect due to aberrant  pollen tube growth. At the subcellular level, Golgi bodies exhibited altered  morphology in cog6 pollen and cell wall components were incorrectly deposited in  pollen tubes. COG6 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), which complemented  the aberrant growth of cog6 pollen tubes, was localized to the Golgi apparatus.  We propose that COG6, as a subunit of the COG complex, modulates Golgi morphology  and vesicle trafficking homeostasis during pollen tube growth.', '2020 Jul 30', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.189', 'Bao']
