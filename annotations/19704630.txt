Auxin plays a wide range of regulatory roles in diverse aspects of plant growth and developmental processes through a complex network of signaling interactions. In the May issue of Journal of Biological Chemistry, we have demonstrated that auxin homeostasis directly links growth regulation with stress adaptation responses through interactions with salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signals. In this signaling network, the endogenous auxin content is coordinately regulated through negative feedback by a group of auxin-inducible GH3 genes that encode auxin-conjugating enzymes. The Arabidopsis mutant wes1-D overexpressing a GH3 gene WES1 exhibits typical auxin-deficient traits, such as reduced growth and leaf curling, but is resistant to both biotic and abiotic stresses. In addition, various stress-regulated genes, including pathogenesis- related protein genes (PRs) and C-repeat/dehydration responsive element binding factor genes (CBFs), are up-regulated in the mutant. Consistent with these observations, WES1 is activated by pathogenic infections and abiotic stresses as well as by exogenous SA and ABA. We therefore propose that the WES1-mediated growth suppression would underlie the commonly observed symptoms of infected or stressed plants and provide a mechanism for auxin action in the fitness costs of induced resistance in plants.
