Here we review how photosynthesis, photorespiration and respiration are affected by increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and climate warming, both separately and in combination. We also compile data from the literature on plants grown at multiple temperatures, focusing on net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates and leaf dark respiration rates measured at the growth temperature (A<sub>growth</sub> and R<sub>growth</sub> , respectively). Our analyses show that the ratio of A<sub>growth</sub> to R<sub>growth</sub> is generally homeostatic across a wide range of species and growth temperatures, and that species that have reduced A<sub>growth</sub> at higher growth temperatures also tend to have reduced R<sub>growth</sub> , while species that show stimulations in A<sub>growth</sub> under warming tend to have higher R<sub>growth</sub> in the hotter environment. These results highlight the need to study these physiological processes together to better predict how vegetation carbon metabolism will respond to climate change.
