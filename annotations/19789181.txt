['19789181', 'GTPases of the Rab1 subclass are essential for membrane traffic between the  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex in animals, fungi and plants.  Rab1-related proteins in higher plants are unusual because sequence comparisons  divide them into two putative subclasses, Rab-D1 and Rab-D2, that are conserved  in monocots and dicots. We tested the hypothesis that the Rab-D1 and Rab-D2  proteins of Arabidopsis represent functionally distinct groups. RAB-D1 and  RAB-D2a each targeted fluorescent proteins to the same punctate structures  associated with the Golgi stacks and trans-Golgi-network. Dominant-inhibitory  N121I mutants of each protein inhibited traffic of diverse cargo proteins at the  ER but they appeared to act via distinct biochemical pathways as biosynthetic  traffic in cells expressing either of the N121I mutants could be restored by  coexpressing the wild-type form of the same subclass but not the other subclass.  The same interaction was observed in transgenic seedlings expressing RAB-D1  [N121I]. Insertional mutants confirmed that the three Arabidopsis Rab-D2 genes  were extensively redundant and collectively performed an essential function that  could not be provided by RAB-D1, which was non-essential. However, plants lacking  RAB-D1, RAB-D2b and RAB-D2c were short and bushy with low fertility, indicating  that the Rab-D1 and Rab-D2 subclasses have overlapping functions.', '2009 Oct 15', 'J Cell Sci', '10.1242/jcs.050625', 'Moore']
