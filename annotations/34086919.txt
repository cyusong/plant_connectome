Ubiquitination, one of the most frequently occurring post-translational modifications, is essential for regulating diverse cellular processes in plants during abiotic stress. The E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase Arabidopsis thaliana really interesting new gene (RING) zinc finger 1 (AtRZF1) mutation is known to enhance drought tolerance in A. thaliana seedlings. To further investigate the function of AtRZF1 in osmotic stress, we isolated Ub-associated protein 1 (AtUAP1) which interacts with AtRZF1 using a yeast two-hybrid system. AtUAP1, a Ub-associated motif containing protein, increased the amount of Ub-conjugated AtRZF1. Moreover, AtUAP1 RNA interference lines were more tolerant to osmotic stress than wild type, whereas AtUAP1-overexpressing (OX) transgenic lines showed sensitive responses, including cotyledon greening, water loss, proline accumulation and changes in stress-related genes expression, indicating that AtUAP1 could negatively regulate dehydration-mediated signaling. In addition, AtUAP1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein was observed in the nuclei of root cells of transgenic seedlings. Genetic studies showed that the AtRZF1 mutation could rescue the sensitive phenotype of AtUAP1-OX lines in response to osmotic stress, suggesting that AtRZF1 was epistatic to AtUAP1 in dehydration signaling. Taken together, our findings describe a new component in the AtRZF1 ubiquitination pathway which controls the dehydration response in A. thaliana.
