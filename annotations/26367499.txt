Many plants show heterophylly, which is variation in leaf form within a plant owing to environmental change. The molecular mechanisms underlying heterophylly have recently been investigated in several plant species. However, little is known about how plants exhibiting heterophylly sense environmental cues. Here, we used Rorippa aquatica (Brassicaceae), which shows heterophylly, to investigate whether a single leaf can sense and transit changes in ambient temperature. The morphology of newly developed leaves after single-leaf warming treatment was significantly different from that of mock-treated control leaves, suggesting that leaves are sensing organs that mediate the responses to changes in ambient temperature in R. aquatica.
