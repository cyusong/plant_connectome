Environmental stresses negatively affect plant development and significantly influence global agricultural productivity. The growth suppression due to soil salinity involves osmotic stress, which is accompanied by ion toxicity, nutritional imbalance, and oxidative stress. The amelioration of salinity stress is one of the fundamental goals to be achieved to ensure food security and better meet the issues related to global hunger. The application of exogenous chemicals is the imperative and efficient choice to alleviate stress in the agricultural field. Among them, hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub> S, a gasotransmitter) is known for its efficient role in stress mitigation, including salinity stress, along with other biological features related to growth and development in plants. H<sub>2</sub> S plays a role in improving photosynthesis and ROS homeostasis, and interacts with other signaling components in a cascade fashion. The current review gives a comprehensive view of the participation of H<sub>2</sub> S in salinity stress alleviation in plants. Further, its crosstalk with other stress ameliorating signaling component or supplement (e.g., NO, H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> , melatonin) is also covered and discussed. Finally, we discuss the possible prospects to meet with success in agricultural fields.
