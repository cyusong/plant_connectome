Dehydration-responsive element binding factors (DREBs) play important roles in plant growth, development, and stress signaling pathways in model plants. However, little is known about the function of DREBs in apple (Malus × domestica), a widely cultivated crop that is frequently threatened by drought. We isolated a DREB gene from Malus sieversii (Ledeb.) Roem., MsDREB6.2, and investigated its functions using overexpression analysis and chimeric repressor gene-silencing technology (CRES-T). We identified possible target genes of the protein encoded by MsDREB6.2 using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Overexpression of MsDREB6.2 increased the expression of a key cytokinin (CK) catabolism gene, MdCKX4a, which led to a significant reduction in endogenous CK levels, and caused a decrease in shoot:root ratio in transgenic apple plants. Overexpression of MsDREB6.2 resulted in a decrease in stomatal aperture and density and an increase in root hydraulic conductance (L<sub>0</sub> ), and thereby enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic plants. Furthermore, manipulating the level of MsDREB6.2 expression altered the expression of two aquaporin (AQP) genes. The effect of the two AQP genes on L<sub>0</sub> was further characterized using the AQP inhibitor HgCl<sub>2</sub> . Based on these observations, we conclude that MsDREB6.2 enhances drought tolerance and that its function may be due, at least in part, to its influence on stomatal opening, root growth, and AQP expression. These results may have applications in apple rootstock breeding programs aimed at developing drought-resistant apple varieties.
