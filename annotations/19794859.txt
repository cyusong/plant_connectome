The plant cell wall contains proteins secreted from the cell. A subset of these proteins is called the secretome, which plays important roles in biological and physiological processes. To gain insight into the secretome for monocot species, we performed proteomic analysis of the rice secretome. In this addendum, we combined the results of two independent studies. For this, 154 rice secreted proteins from our study were compared to 42 non-redundant rice secreted proteins from another group. Surprisingly, only 20 proteins were commonly found in the two groups, indicating that the materials and methods are very important factors finding secreted proteins. Finally, a total of 172 rice secreted proteins were assigned molecular functions and biological processes according to gene ontology annotation. These comparative and integrative analyses of the rice secretome provide a large number of rice secreted proteins that can be used in subsequent investigations.
