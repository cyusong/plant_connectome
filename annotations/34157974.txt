Identifying genes involved in salt tolerance in the recretohalophyte Limonium bicolor could facilitate the breeding of crops with enhanced salt tolerance. Here we cloned the previously uncharacterized gene LbHLH and explored its role in salt tolerance. The 2,067-bp open reading frame of LbHLH encodes a 688-amino-acid protein with a typical helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain. In situ hybridization showed that LbHLH is expressed in salt glands of L. bicolor. LbHLH localizes to the nucleus, and LbHLH is highly expressed during salt gland development and in response to NaCl treatment. To further explore its function, we heterologously expressed LbHLH in Arabidopsis thaliana under the 35S promoter. The overexpression lines showed significantly increased trichome number and reduced root hair number. LbHLH might interact with GLABRA1 to influence trichome and root hair development, as revealed by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The transgenic lines showed higher germination percentages and longer roots than the wild type under NaCl treatment. Analysis of seedlings grown on medium containing sorbitol with the same osmotic pressure as 100 mM NaCl demonstrated that overexpressing LbHLH enhanced osmotic resistance. These results indicate that LbHLH enhances salt tolerance by reducing root hair development and enhancing osmotic resistance under NaCl stress.
