Amongst the myriad of metabolites produced by plants, primary metabolites and hormones play crucial housekeeping roles in the cell and are essential for proper plant growth and development. While the biosynthetic pathways of primary metabolism are well characterized, those of hormones are yet to be completely defined. Central metabolism provides precursors for hormone biosynthesis and the regulation and function of primary metabolites and hormones are tightly entwined. The combination of reverse genetics and technological advances in our ability to evaluate the levels of the molecular entities of the cell (transcripts, proteins and metabolites) has led to considerable improvements in our understanding of both the regulatory interaction between primary metabolites and hormones and its coordination in response to different conditions. Here, we provide an overview of the interaction of primary and hormone metabolism at the metabolic and signaling levels, as well as a perspective regarding the tools that can be used to tackle our current knowledge gaps at the signaling level.
