Advances in deep learning and transfer learning have paved the way for various automation classification tasks in agriculture, including plant diseases, pests, weeds, and plant species detection. However, agriculture automation still faces various challenges, such as the limited size of datasets and the absence of plant-domain-specific pretrained models. Domain specific pretrained models have shown state of art performance in various computer vision tasks including face recognition and medical imaging diagnosis. In this paper, we propose AgriNet dataset, a collection of 160k agricultural images from more than 19 geographical locations, several images captioning devices, and more than 423 classes of plant species and diseases. We also introduce AgriNet models, a set of pretrained models on five ImageNet architectures: VGG16, VGG19, Inception-v3, InceptionResNet-v2, and Xception. AgriNet-VGG19 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 94% and the highest F1-score of 92%. Additionally, all proposed models were found to accurately classify the 423 classes of plant species, diseases, pests, and weeds with a minimum accuracy of 87% for the Inception-v3 model. Finally, experiments to evaluate of superiority of AgriNet models compared to ImageNet models were conducted on two external datasets: pest and plant diseases dataset from Bangladesh and a plant diseases dataset from Kashmir.
