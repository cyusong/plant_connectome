Members of <i>SEPALLATA</i> (<i>SEP</i>) and <i>APETALA1</i> (<i>AP1</i>)/<i>SQUAMOSA</i> (<i>SQUA</i>) MADS-box transcription factor subfamilies play key roles in floral organ identity determination and floral meristem determinacy in the rosid species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we present a functional characterization of the seven <i>SEP</i>/<i>AGL6</i> and four <i>AP1</i>/<i>SQUA</i> genes in the distant asterid species petunia (<i>Petunia</i> × <i>hybrida</i>). Based on the analysis of single and higher order mutants, we report that the petunia <i>SEP1</i>/<i>SEP2</i>/<i>SEP3</i> orthologs together with <i>AGL6</i> encode classical <i>SEP</i> floral organ identity and floral termination functions, with a master role for the petunia <i>SEP3</i> ortholog <i>FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN2</i> (<i>FBP2</i>). By contrast, the <i>FBP9</i> subclade members <i>FBP9</i> and <i>FBP23</i>, for which no clear ortholog is present in Arabidopsis, play a major role in determining floral meristem identity together with <i>FBP4</i>, while contributing only moderately to floral organ identity. In turn, the four members of the petunia <i>AP1</i>/<i>SQUA</i> subfamily redundantly are required for inflorescence meristem identity and act as B-function repressors in the first floral whorl, together with <i>BEN</i>/<i>ROB</i> genes. Overall, these data together with studies in other species suggest major differences in the functional diversification of the <i>SEP</i>/<i>AGL6</i> and <i>AP1</i>/<i>SQUA</i> MADS-box subfamilies during angiosperm evolution.plantcell;31/12/3033/FX1F1fx1.
