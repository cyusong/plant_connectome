Oilseed plants accumulate triacylglycerol (TAG) up to 80% of seed weight with the TAG fatty acid composition determining its nutritional value or use in the biofuel or chemical industries. Two major pathways for production of diacylglycerol (DAG), the immediate precursor to TAG, have been identified in plants: de novo DAG synthesis and conversion of the membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) to DAG, with each pathway producing distinct TAG compositions. However, neither pathway fits with previous biochemical and transcriptomic results from developing Physaria fendleri seeds for accumulation of TAG containing >60% lesquerolic acid (an unusual 20 carbon hydroxylated fatty acid), which accumulates at only the sn-1 and sn-3 positions of TAG. Isotopic tracing of developing P. fendleri seed lipid metabolism identified that PC-derived DAG is utilized to initially produce TAG with only one lesquerolic acid. Subsequently a nonhydroxylated fatty acid is removed from TAG (transiently reproducing DAG) and a second lesquerolic acid is incorporated. Thus, a dynamic TAG remodeling process involving anabolic and catabolic reactions controls the final TAG fatty acid composition. Reinterpretation of P. fendleri transcriptomic data identified potential genes involved in TAG remodeling that could provide a new approach for oilseed engineering by altering oil fatty acid composition after initial TAG synthesis; and the comparison of current results to that of related Brassicaceae species in the literature suggests the possibility of TAG remodeling involved in incorporation of very long-chain fatty acids into the TAG sn-1 position in various plants.
