Reactive oxygen signaling regulates numerous biological processes, including stress responses in plants. Redox sensors transduce reactive oxygen signals into cellular responses. Here, we present biochemical evidence that a plant quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase homolog (QSOX1) is a redox sensor that negatively regulates plant immunity against a bacterial pathogen. The expression level of QSOX1 is inversely correlated with pathogen-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Interestingly, QSOX1 both senses and regulates ROS levels by interactingn with and mediating redox regulation of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, which, consistent with previous findings, influences reactive nitrogen-mediated regulation of ROS generation. Collectively, our data indicate that QSOX1 is a redox sensor that negatively regulates plant immunity by linking reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen signaling to limit ROS production.
