To study viral infection, the direct structural visualization of the viral life cycle consisting of virus attachment, entry, replication, assembly and transport is essential. Although conventional electron microscopy (EM) has been extremely helpful in the investigation of virus-host cell interactions, three-dimensional (3D) EM not only provides important information at the nanometer resolution, but can also create 3D maps of large volumes, even entire virus-infected cells. Here, we determined the ultrastructural details of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV)-infected plant cells using focused ion beam scanning EM (FIB-SEM). The viral morphogenesis and dynamic transformation of paired parallel membranes (PPMs) were analyzed. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane network consisting of tubules and sheets was related to viral intracellular trafficking and virion storage. Abundant lipid-like bodies, clustering mitochondria, cell membrane tubules, and myelin-like bodies were likely associated with viral infection. Additionally, connecting structures between neighboring cells were found only in infected plant tissues and showed the characteristics of tubular structure. These novel connections that formed continuously in the cell wall or were wrapped by the cell membranes of neighboring cells appeared frequently in the large-scale 3D model, suggesting additional strategies for viral trafficking that were difficult to distinguish using conventional EM.
