Arabidopsis phytochrome A (phyA) regulates not only seed germination and seedling de-etiolation but also circadian rhythms and flowering time in adult plants. The SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA1) acts as a negative regulator of phyA-mediated de-etiolation of young seedlings, but its roles in adult plants have not yet been described. Here, we show that SPA1 is involved in regulating circadian rhythms and flowering time in plants. Under constant light, the abundance of SPA1 protein exhibited circadian regulation, whereas under constant darkness, SPA1 protein levels remained unchanged. These results indicate that the SPA1 protein is controlled by the circadian clock and light signals. In addition, the spa1-3 mutation slightly shortened the circadian period of CCA1, TOC1/PRR1 and SPA1 transcript accumulation under constant light. Phenotypic analysis showed that the spa1-3 mutant flowers early under short-day (SD) but not long-day (LD) conditions. Consistent with this finding, transcripts encoding flowering locus T (FT), which promotes flowering, increased in spa1-3 under only SD conditions, although the CONSTANS (CO) transcript level was not affected under either SD nor LD conditions. Our results indicate that SPA1 not only negatively controls phyA-mediated signaling in seedlings, but also regulates circadian rhythms and flowering time in plants.
