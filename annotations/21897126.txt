SGT1 (suppressor of G-two allele of SKP1) is highly conserved among all eukaryotes. In plants, SGT1 interacts with various proteins, including molecular chaperones (HSP70 and HSP90) and certain SCF ubiquitin ligases, and hence SGT1 likely functions in protein folding and stability. Since these protein complexes are involved in many aspects of plant biology, plants with a defective SGT1 display a plethora of phenotypic alterations. In this review we highlight the interaction between SGT1 with other protein complexes and summarize the function of SGT1 in plant defense responses and development, including the recent advancements in the understanding of the role of SGT1 in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and signaling.
