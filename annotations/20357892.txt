['20357892', 'The circadian clock is a timekeeping mechanism that enables anticipation of daily  environmental changes. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the circadian system is  a multiloop series of interlocked transcription-translation feedbacks. Several  genes have been arranged in these oscillation loops, but the position of the  core-clock gene ELF4 in this network was previously undetermined. ELF4 lacks  sequence similarity to known domains, and functional homologs have not yet been  identified. Here we show that ELF4 is functionally conserved within a subclade of  related sequences, and forms an alpha-helical homodimer with a likely  electrostatic interface that could be structurally modeled. We support this  hypothesis by expression analysis of new elf4 hypomorphic alleles. These weak  mutants were found to have expression level phenotypes of both morning and  evening clock genes, implicating multiple entry points of ELF4 within the  multiloop network. This could be mathematically modeled. Furthermore,  morning-expression defects were particular to some elf4 alleles, suggesting  predominant ELF4 action just preceding dawn. We provide a new hypothesis about  ELF4 in the oscillator-it acts as a homodimer to integrate two arms of the  circadian clock.', '2009 Oct', 'HFSP J', '10.2976/1.3218766', 'Davis']
