RUBylation plays essential roles in plant growth and development through regulating Cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase (CRL) activities and the CRL-mediated protein degradations. However, the function of RUBylation in regulating kernel development remains unclear. Through genetic and molecular analyses of a small kernel 501 (smk501) mutant in maize (Zea mays), we cloned the smk501 gene, revealed its molecular function, and defined its roles in RUBylation pathway and seed development. Smk501 encodes a RUBylation activating enzyme E1 subunit ZmECR1 (E1 C-TERMINAL RELATED 1) protein. Destruction in RUBylation by smk501 mutation resulted in less embryo and endosperm cell number and smaller kernel size. The transcriptome and proteome profiling, hormone evaluation and cell proliferation observation revealed that disturbing ZmECR1 expression mainly affects pathways on hormone signal transduction, cell cycle progression and starch accumulation during kernel development. In addition, mutant in zmaxr1 (Auxin resistant 1), another RUB E1 subunit, also showed similar defects in kernel development. Double mutation of zmecr1 and zmaxr1 lead to empty pericarp kernel phenotype. RUBylation is a novel regulatory pathway affecting maize kernel development, majorly through its functions in modifying multiple cellular progresses.
