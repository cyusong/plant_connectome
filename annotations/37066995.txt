Seed weight is usually associated with seed size and is one of the important agronomic traits that determine yield. Understanding of seed weight control is limited especially in soybean plants. Here we show that GmJAZ3, a gene identified through gene co-expression network analysis, regulates seed-related traits in soybean. Overexpression of GmJAZ3 promotes seed size/weight and other organ size in stable transgenic soybean plants likely by increasing cell proliferation. GmJAZ3 interacted with both GmRR18a and GmMYC2a to inhibit their transcriptional activation of cytokinin oxidase gene GmCKX3-4, which usually affects seed traits. Meanwhile, the GmRR18a binds to the promoter of GmMYC2a and activates GmMYC2a gene expression. In GmJAZ3-overexpressing soybean seeds, the protein contents were increased while the fatty acid contents were reduced compared to those in the control seeds, indicating that the GmJAZ3 affects seed size/weight and compositions. Natural variation in JAZ3 promoter region was further analyzed and Hap3 promoter correlates with higher promoter activity, higher gene expression and higher seed weight. The Hap3 promoter may be selected and fixed during soybean domestication. JAZ3 orthologues from other plants/crops may also control seed size and weight. Taken together, our study reveals a novel molecular module GmJAZ3-GmRR18a/GmMYC2a-GmCKXs for seed size and weight control, providing promising targets during soybean molecular breeding for better seed traits.
