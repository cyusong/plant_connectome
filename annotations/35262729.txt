['35262729', "In plants, heat stress induces changes in alternative splicing, including intron  retention; these events can rapidly alter proteins or downregulate protein  activity, producing nonfunctional isoforms or inducing nonsense-mediated decay of  messenger RNA (mRNA). Nuclear cyclophilins (CYPs) are accessory proteins in the  spliceosome complexes of multicellular eukaryotes. However, whether plant CYPs  are involved in pre-mRNA splicing remain unknown. Here, we found that Arabidopsis  thaliana CYP18-1 is necessary for the efficient removal of introns that are  retained in response to heat stress during germination. CYP18-1 interacts with  Step II splicing factors (PRP18a, PRP22, and SWELLMAP1) and associates with the  U2 and U5 small nuclear RNAs in response to heat stress. CYP18-1 binds to  phospho-PRP18a, and increasing concentrations of CYP18-1 are associated with  increasing dephosphorylation of PRP18a. Furthermore, interaction and protoplast  transfection assays revealed that CYP18-1 and the PP2A-type phosphatase PP2A B'eta  co-regulate PRP18a dephosphorylation. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that  CYP18-1 is essential for splicing introns that are retained under heat stress.  Overall, we reveal the mechanism of action by which CYP18-1 activates the  dephosphorylation of PRP18 and show that CYP18-1 is crucial for the efficient  splicing of retained introns and rapid responses to heat stress in plants.", '2022 May 24', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koac084', 'ORCID:']
