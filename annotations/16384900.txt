The cereal aleurone layer is a model system for studying the regulation of transcription by gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA). GA stimulates and ABA prevents the transcription of genes for alpha-amylases and other secreted hydrolytic enzymes, but how GA and ABA affect the transcription of other genes is largely unknown. We characterized gene expression in rice (Oryza sativa) aleurone using a half-genome rice microarray. Of the 23,000 probe sets on the chip, approximately 11,000 hybridized with RNA from rice aleurone treated with ABA, GA, or no hormone. As expected, GA regulated the expression of many genes, and 3 times as many genes were up-regulated by GA at 8 h than were down-regulated. Changes in gene expression resulting from ABA treatment were not consistent with the hypothesis that the role of ABA in this tissue is primarily to repress gene expression, and 10 times more genes were up-regulated by ABA at 8 h than were down-regulated by ABA. We also measured transcript abundance in aleurone of dwarf1 (d1) mutant rice. The d1 protein is the sole alpha-subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins in rice. Genes up-regulated by GA or ABA had higher expression in wild type than in d1 aleurone, and genes down-regulated by GA had lower expression in wild type relative to d1 aleurone. The d1 mutation did not result in a decrease in sensitivity to GA at the level of transcription. Rather, changes in transcript abundance were smaller in the d1 mutant than in wild type.
