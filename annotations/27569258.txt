Here, we characterized nitrogen (N) uptake of beech (Fagus sylvatica) and their associated ectomycorrhizal (EM) communities from NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> . We hypothesized that a proportional fraction of ectomycorrhizal N uptake is transferred to the host, thereby resulting in the same uptake patterns of plants and their associated mycorrhizal communities. <sup>15</sup> N uptake was studied under various field conditions after short-term and long-term exposure to a pulse of equimolar NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations, where one compound was replaced by <sup>15</sup> N. In native EM assemblages, long-term and short-term <sup>15</sup> N uptake from NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> was higher than that from NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> , regardless of season, water availability and site exposure, whereas in beech long-term <sup>15</sup> N uptake from NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was higher than that from NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> . The transfer rates from the EM to beech were lower for <sup>15</sup> N from NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> than from NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> . <sup>15</sup> N content in EM was correlated with <sup>15</sup> N uptake of the host for <sup>15</sup> NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> , but not for <sup>15</sup> NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> -derived N. These findings suggest stronger control of the EM assemblage on N provision to the host from NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> than from NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> . Different host and EM accumulation patterns for inorganic N will result in complementary resource use, which might be advantageous in forest ecosystems with limited N availability.
