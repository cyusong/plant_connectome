Hybrid breakdown, a form of postzygotic reproductive barrier, has been reported to hinder gene flow in many crosses between wild and cultivated rice. Here, the phenomenon of hybrid breakdown was observed as low-tillering (i.e., low tiller number) in some progeny of an interspecific cross produced in an attempt to introduce <i>Oryza meridionalis</i> Ng (W1625) chromosomal segments into <i>Oryza sativa</i> L. ssp. <i>japonica</i> "Taichung 65" (T65). Low-tillering lines were obtained in BC<sub>4</sub>-derived progeny from a cross between W1625 and "Taichung 65," but the locus for low-tillering could not be mapped in segregating populations. As a second approach to map the locus for low-tillering, we analyzed an F<sub>2</sub> population derived from a cross between the low-tillering lines and a high-yielding <i>indica</i> cultivar, "Takanari." A major QTL for low-tillering, <i>qLTN4</i>, was detected between PCR-based markers MS10 and RM307 on the long arm of chromosome 4, with a LOD score of 15.6. The low-tillering phenotype was associated with weak growth and pale yellow phenotype; however, low-tillering plant had less reduction of grain fertility. In an F<sub>4</sub> population (4896 plants), 563 recombinant plants were identified and the low-tillering locus was delimited to a 4.6-Mbp region between markers W1 and C5-indel3729. This region could not be further delimited because recombination is restricted in this region of <i>qLTN4</i>, which is near the centromere. Understanding the genetic basis of hybrid breakdown, including the low-tillering habit, will be important for improving varieties in rice breeding.
