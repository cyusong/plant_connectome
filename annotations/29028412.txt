The functional role of the periplasm of nitrogen-fixing bacteroids has not been determined. Proteins were isolated from the periplasm and cytoplasm of Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens bacteroids and were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry proteomics. Identification of bacteroid periplasmic proteins was aided by periplasm prediction programs. Approximately 40% of all the proteins identified as periplasmic in the B. diazoefficiens genome were found expressed in the bacteroid form of the bacteria, indicating the periplasm is a metabolically active symbiotic space. The bacteroid periplasm possesses many fatty acid metabolic enzymes, which was in contrast to the bacteroid cytoplasm. Amino acid analysis of the periplasm revealed an abundance of phosphoserine, phosphoethanolamine, and glycine, which are metabolites of phospholipid metabolism. These results suggest the periplasm is a unique space and not a continuum with the peribacteroid space. A number of plant proteins were found in the periplasm fraction, which suggested contamination. However, antibodies to two of the identified plant proteins, histone H2A and lipoxygenase, yielded immunogold labeling that demonstrated the plant proteins were specifically targeted to the bacteroids. This suggests that the periplasm is an interkingdom symbiotic space containing proteins from both the bacteroid and the plant.
