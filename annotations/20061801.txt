Phototropins are blue light receptors that mediate responses such as phototropism, chloroplast movement, stomatal opening and leaf expansion. One candidate signaling molecule from phototropins is cytosolic Ca(2+), since phototropins increase the cytosolic Ca(2+) in seedlings and mesophyll cells. The potential involvement of Ca(2+) in the blue light-dependent activation of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase in guard cells has been reported, but it is not yet known whether cytosolic Ca(2+) in guard cells increases in response to blue light. We recently studied changes in the cytosolic Ca(2+) in guard cells in response to blue light using aequorin-transformed Arabidopsis. We detected no increase in Ca(2+) prior to blue light-dependent activation of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase that depended on phototropins. But we detected a photosynthesis-dependent Ca(2+) increase. Only when the external K(+) concentration was low did blue light induce Ca(2+) influx based on phototropin-mediated membrane hyperpolarization. In this addendum, I discuss Ca(2+) changes in response to blue light in guard cells and phototropin-mediated Ca(2+) signaling.

phototropins: !mediate! responses 
phototropins: !increase! cytosolic Ca(2+) 
blue light: !activates! plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase 
aequorin-transformed Arabidopsis: !detects! Ca(2+) changes 
photosynthesis: !induces! Ca(2+) increase 
low external K(+): !induces! Ca(2+) influx 
phototropin: !mediates! membrane hyperpolarization
