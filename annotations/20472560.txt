['20472560', 'Eukaryotes employ complex immune mechanisms for protection against microbial  pathogens. Here, we identified SCD1 (Stomatal Cytokinesis-Defective 1),  previously implicated in growth and development through its role in cytokinesis  and polarized cell expansion (Falbel, T. G., Koch, L. M., Nadeau, J. A.,  Segui-Simarro, J. M., Sack, F. D., and Bednarek, S. Y. (2003) Development 130,  4011-4024) as a novel component of innate immunity. In Arabidopsis, SCD1 is a  unique gene encoding for the only protein containing a complete DENN  (Differentially Expressed in Normal and Neoplastic cells) domain. The DENN domain  is a largely uncharacterized tripartite protein motif conserved among eukaryotic  proteins. We show that conditional scd1-1 plants containing a point mutation in a  conserved DENN residue affected a subset of signaling responses to some bacterial  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Consistent with increased  transcript accumulation of Pathogen-related (PR) genes, scd1-1 plants were more  resistant to Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato (Pst) DC3000 infection  implicating SCD1 as a negative regulator of basal resistance against bacteria.  scd1-1 plants were different from known mutants exhibiting constitutive expressor  of PR (cpr)-like phenotypes, in that growth impairment of scd1-1 plants was  genetically independent of constitutive immune response activation. For scd1-1,  shift to elevated temperature or introduction of a mutant allele in Salicylic  acid Induction-Deficient 2 (SID2) suppressed constitutive defense response  activation. sid2-2 also repressed the resistance phenotype of scd1-1. Temperature  shift and sid2-2, however, did not rescue conditional growth and sterility  defects of scd1-1. These results implicate SCD1 in multiple cellular pathways,  possibly by affecting different proteins. Overall, our studies identified a novel  role for eukaryotic DENN proteins in immunity against bacteria.', '2010 Jul 23', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M109.090787', 'Heese']
