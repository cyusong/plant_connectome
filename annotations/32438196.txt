Many plant metabolism processes are currently not completely understood despite the numerous studies. These include the events in plant shoots and especially in the apical meristem. To understand the various mechanisms on a molecular level, a combined approach of target and non-targeted fingerprinting analysis was worked out on different white asparagus spear segments using high resolution mass spectrometry. By means of various multivariate analysis strategies, numerous distinctions within diverse substance classes were observed. While most of the investigated metabolites were present in relatively higher concentrations in the tip of the asparagus spears, others were more accumulated at the bottom, some, in turn, did not show any concentration differences along the shoot. Using pathway analysis, the most significant metabolites were classified in the biological context. To our knowledge for the first time, a non-targeted metabolomics approach is used with the aim of metabolic profiling of plant sprouts.
