Cuticular wax forms a hydrophobic barrier on aerial plant organs; it plays an important role in protecting a plant from damage caused by many forms of environmental stress. In the present study, we characterized a rice leaf wax-deficient mutant osgl1-1 derived from a spontaneous mutation, which exhibited a wax-deficient and highly hydrophilic leaf phenotype. We cloned the OsGL1-1 gene by the map-based cloning method and performed a complementation test to confirm the function of the candidate gene. Molecular studies revealed that OsGL1-1 was a member of the OsGL1 family, and contained regions that were homologous to some regions in sterol desaturases and short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. Compared to the wild-type, the osgl1-1 mutant showed decreased cuticular wax deposition, thinner cuticular membrane, decreased chlorophyll leaching, increased rate of water loss, and enhanced sensitivity to drought. OsGL1-1 is expressed ubiquitously in rice. The transient expression of OsGL1-1-green fluorescent protein fusion protein indicated that OsGL1-1 is localized in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, and nucleus.
