Polarization of the zygote defines the body axis during plant development. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the zygote becomes polarized and elongates in the longitudinal direction, ultimately forming the apical-basal axis of the mature plant. Despite its importance, the mechanism for this elongation remains poorly understood. Based on live-cell imaging of the zygote, we developed new image analysis methods, referred to as coordinate normalization, that appropriately fix and align positions in an image, preventing fluctuation across a temporal sequence of images. Using these methods, we discovered that the zygote elongates only at its apical tip region, similar to tip-growing cells such as pollen tubes and root hairs. We also investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of the apical tip contour of the zygote and observed that the zygote tip retains its isotropic, hemispherical apical shape during cell elongation. By looking at the elliptical fitting of the contour over time, we further discovered that the apical cell tip becomes thinner at first and then thickens, with a transient increase in growth speed that is followed by the first cell division. We performed the same series of analyses using root hairs and established that the hemispherical tip shape and the changes in growth rate associated with changes in tip size are both specific to the zygote. In summary, the Arabidopsis zygote undergoes directional elongation as a tip-growing cell, but its tip retains an unusual isotropic shape, and the manner of growth changes with the developmental stage.
