['16098107', "It has been reported that eukaryotic organisms have a nonsense-mediated mRNA  decay (NMD) system to exclude aberrant mRNAs that produce truncated proteins. NMD  is an RNA surveillance pathway that degrades mRNAs possessing premature  translation termination codons (PTCs), thus avoiding production of possibly toxic  truncated proteins. Three interacting proteins, UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3, are required  for NMD in mammals and yeasts, and their amino acid sequences are well conserved  among most eukaryotes, including plants. In this study, 'The Arabidopsis  Information Resource' database was searched for mRNAs with premature termination  codons. We selected five of these mRNAs and checked for the presence of PTCs in  these mRNAs when translated in vivo. As a result we identified aberrant mRNAs  produced by alternative splicing for each gene. These genes produced at least one  alternative splicing variant including a PTC (PTC+) and another variant without a  PTC (PTC-). We analyzed their PTC+/PTC- ratios in wild-type Arabidopsis and upf3  mutant plants and showed that the PTC+/PTC- ratios were higher in atupf3 mutant  plants than wild-type plants and that the atupf3 mutant was less able to degrade  mRNAs with premature termination codons than wild-type plants. This indicated  that the AtUPF3 gene is required by the plant NMD system to obviate aberrantly  spliced mRNA.", '2005 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02473.x', 'Watanabe']
