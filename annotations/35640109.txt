Mangroves are frequently inundated with saline water and have evolved different anatomical and physiological mechanisms to filter and, in some species, excrete excess salt from the water they take up. Because salts impose osmotic stress, interspecific differences in salt tolerance and salt management strategy may influence physiological responses to drought throughout the entire plant hydraulic pathway, from roots to leaves. Here, we characterized embolism vulnerability simultaneously in leaves, stems, and roots of seedlings of two mangrove species (Avicennia marina and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza) along with turgor-loss points in roots and leaves and xylem anatomical traits. In both species, the water potentials causing 50% of total embolism were less negative in roots and leaves than they were in stems, but the water potentials causing incipient embolism (5%) were similar in roots, stems, and leaves. Stomatal closure in leaves and turgor loss in both leaves and roots occurred at water potentials only slightly less negative than the water potentials causing 5% of total embolism. Xylem anatomical traits were unrelated to vulnerability to embolism. Vulnerability segmentation may be important in limiting embolism spread into stems from more vulnerable roots and leaves. Interspecific differences in salt tolerance affected hydraulic traits from roots to leaves: the salt-secretor A. marina lost turgor at more negative water potentials and had more embolism-resistant xylem than the salt-excluder B. gymnorrhiza. Characterizing physiological thresholds of roots may help to explain recent mangrove mortality after drought and extended saltwater inundation.
