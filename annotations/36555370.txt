Auxin plays a critical role in organogenesis in plants. The classical auxin signaling pathway holds that auxin initiates downstream signal transduction by degrading Aux/IAA transcription repressors that interact with ARF transcription factors. In this study, 23 <i>MoIAA</i> genes were identified in the drumstick tree genome. All <i>MoIAA</i> genes were located within five subfamilies based on phylogenetic evolution analysis; the gene characteristics and promoter cis-elements were also analyzed. The protein interaction network between the MoIAAs with MoARFs was complex. The <i>MoIAA</i> gene family responded positively to NAA treatment, exhibiting different patterns and degrees, notably for <i>MoIAA1</i>, <i>MoIAA7</i> and <i>MoIAA13</i>. The three genes expressed and functioned in the nucleus; only the intact encoding protein of <i>MoIAA13</i> exhibited transcriptional activation activity. The shoot regeneration capacity in the <i>35S::MoIAA13-OE</i> transgenic line was considerably lower than in the wild type. These results establish a foundation for further research on <i>MoIAA</i> gene function and provide useful information for improved tissue culture efficiency and molecular breeding of <i>M. oleifera</i>.
