SUMO is a modifying peptide that regulates protein activity and is essential to eukaryotes. In plants, SUMO plays an important role in both development and the response to environmental stimuli. The best described sumoylation pathway component is the SUMO E3 ligase SIZ1. Its mutant displays inefficient responses to nutrient imbalance in phosphate, nitrate and copper. Recently, we reported that siz1 also displays altered responses to exogenous sugar supplementation. The siz1 mutant is a salicylic acid (SA) accumulator, and SA may interfere with sugar-dependent responses and signaling events. Here, we extended our previous studies to determine the importance of SA in the SIZ1 response to sugars, by introducing the bacterial salicylate hydroxylase NahG into the siz1 background. Results demonstrate that siz1 phenotypes involving delayed germination are partially dependent of SA levels, whereas the sugar-signaling effect of sugars is independent of SA.
