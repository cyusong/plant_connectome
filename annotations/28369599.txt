Grapevine is one of the world's most important fruit crops. European cultivated grape species have the best fruit quality but show almost no resistance to powdery mildew (PM). PM caused by Uncinula necator is a harmful disease that has a significant impact on the economic value of the grape crop. In this study, we examined a RING-H2-type ubiquitin ligase gene VpRH2 that is associated with significant PM-resistance of Chinese wild-growing grape Vitis pseudoreticulata accession Baihe-35-1. The expression of VpRH2 was clearly induced by U. necator inoculation compared with its homologous gene VvRH2 in a PM-susceptible grapevine V. vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay we confirmed that VpRH2 interacted with VpGRP2A, a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein. The degradation of VpGRP2A was inhibited by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 while VpRH2 did not promote the degradation of VpGRP2A. Instead, the transcripts of VpRH2 were increased by over-expressing VpGRP2A while VpRH2 suppressed the expression of VpGRP2A. Furthermore, VpGRP2A was down-regulated in both Baihe-35-1 and Thompson Seedless after U. necator inoculation. Specifically, we generated VpRH2 overexpression transgenic lines in Thompson Seedless and found that the transgenic plants showed enhanced resistance to powdery mildew compared with the wild-type. In summary, our results indicate that VpRH2 interacts with VpGRP2A and plays a positive role in resistance to powdery mildew.
