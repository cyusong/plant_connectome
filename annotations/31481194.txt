['31481194', 'Although the genes controlling chloroplast development play important roles in  plant responses to environmental stresses, the molecular mechanisms remain  largely unclear. In this study, an Arabidopsis mutant dpg1 (delayed  pale-greening1) with a chloroplast development defect was studied. By using  quantitative RT-PCR and histochemical GUS assays, we demonstrated that AtDPG1 was  mainly expressed in the green tissues of Arabidopsis seedlings and could be  induced by salt stress. Phenotypic analysis showed that mutation in AtDPG1 lead  to an enhanced sensitivity to salt stress in Arabidopsis seedlings. Further  studies demonstrated that disruption of the AtDPG1 in Arabidopsis increases its  sensitivity to salt stress in an ABA-dependent manner. Moreover, expression  levels of various stress-responsive and ABA signal-related genes were remarkably  altered in the dpg1 plants under NaCl treatment. Notably, the transcript levels  of ABI4 in dpg1 mutant increased more significantly than that in wild type plants  under salt conditions. The seedlings of dpg1/abi4 double mutant exhibited  stronger resistance to salt stress after salt treatment compared with the dpg1  single mutant, suggesting that the salt-hypersensitive phenotype of dpg1  seedlings could be rescued via loss of ABI4 function. These results reveal that  AtDPG1 is involved in the salt stress response of Arabidopsis seedling through  ABI4.', '2019 Oct', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.110180', 'Liu']
