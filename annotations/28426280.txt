The Antirrhinum DNA transposon Tam3 uniquely demonstrates low temperature-dependent transposition (LTDT), so transposition does not occur at high temperatures. We previously showed that the detainment of Tam3 transposase (TPase) at the plasma membrane occurs when transposition is inactive, and that TPase is released at the permissive state of Tam3 transposition. LTDT of Tam3 is attributed to interactions between Tam3 and its host. In this addendum, we propose a model to explain the LTDT of Tam3, which is regarded as an equilibrium state reached between the host and parasite to maximize the fitness of both.
