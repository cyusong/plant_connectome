Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) accumulation in Nostoc muscorum was studied in presence of various metabolic inhibitors. Supplementation of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) was found to suppress PHB accumulation in phosphate-limited N. muscorum under photoautotrophic growth condition. PHB accumulation increased up to 21% and 17% from an initial PHB content of 8.5% of dry weight, respectively, under carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) treatment, whereas 2,4 -dinitrophenol (DNP) supplementation depicted insignificant effect on PHB pool of the test cyanobacterium. Supplementation of l-methionine-dl-sulfoximine (MSX) and azaserine was also found to increase PHB accumulation in N(2) -fixing and NH(4)(+) -grown N. muscorum, but not in NO(3)(-) -grown cells. The stimulatory action of monofluoroacetate on PHB accumulation was suppressed in presence of alpha-ketoglutarate and DCMU. Interestingly, 2,3 -butanedione supplementation was not only found inhibitory for accumulation of PHB in P-deficient, N-deficient and chemoheterotrophically grown N. muscorum but suppression of PHB synthesis was also evident in control cultures in presence of 2,3 -butanedione. The possible mechanisms are discussed.
