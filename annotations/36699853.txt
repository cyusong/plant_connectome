The leaves of <i>Eucommia ulmoides</i> contain various active compunds and nutritional components, and have successively been included as raw materials in the <i>Chinese Pharmacopoeia</i>, the <i>Health Food Raw Material Catalogue</i>, and the <i>Feed Raw Material Catalogue</i>. Core collections of <i>E. ulmoides</i> had been constructed from the conserved germplasm resources basing on molecular markers and morphological traits, however, the metabolite diversity and variation in this core population were little understood. Metabolite profiles of <i>E. ulmoides</i> leaves of 193 core collections were comprehensively characterized by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS based non-targeted metabolomics in present study. Totally 1,100 metabolites were identified and that belonged to 18 categories, and contained 120 active ingredients for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and 85 disease-resistant metabolites. Four leaf chemotypes of the core collections were established by integrated uses of unsupervised self-organizing map (SOM), supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and random forest (RF) statistical methods, 30, 23, 43, and 23 chemomarkers were screened corresponding to the four chemotypes, respectively. The morphological markers for the chemotypes were obtained by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) between the chenomarkers and the morphological traits, with leaf length (LL), chlorophyll reference value (CRV), leaf dentate height (LDH), and leaf thickness (LT) corresponding to chemotypes I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Contents of quercetin-3-O-pentosidine, isoquercitrin were closely correlated to LL, leaf area (LA), and leaf perimeter (LP), suggesting the quercetin derivatives might influence the growth and development of <i>E. ulmoides</i> leaf shape.
