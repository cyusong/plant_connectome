['16786289', 'The AtDi19 (drought-induced) gene family encodes seven hydrophilic proteins that  contain two atypical Cys2/His2 (C2H2) zinc finger-like domains that are  evolutionarily well-conserved within angiosperms suggesting a conserved and  important function. Five of the seven Arabidopsis AtDi19-related:DsRed2 fusion  proteins exhibited speckled patterns of localization within the nucleus as shown  by transient expression analysis in Arabidopsis protoplasts. In contrast,  AtDi19-2:DsRed2 was present in the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas AtDi19-4:DsRed2  was localized to the nuclear periphery. mRNA expression studies showed that  AtDi19 genes are ubiquitously expressed in Arabidopsis tissues, although some  differences were observed. In seedlings, RT-PCR analyses showed that AtDi19-1 and  AtDi19-3 steady-state transcript amounts were rapidly induced by dehydration,  whereas transcript amounts for AtDi19-2 and AtDi19-4 increased in response to  high-salt stress. In addition, the mRNA abundance of all the AtDi19-related gene  family members was not regulated by ABA. These data, taken together, suggest that  several AtDi19-related gene family members may function in ABA-independent,  dehydration and salinity stress signaling pathways. However, they may also be  regulated by other abiotic stimuli. AtDi19-7, for example, has been implicated in  regulating light signaling and responses. Finally, we show that most  AtDi19-related proteins are phosphorylated in vitro by calcium-dependent protein  kinases suggesting that this post-translational modification may be important for  regulating the function of this novel protein family.', '2006 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-005-5798-7', 'Cushman']
