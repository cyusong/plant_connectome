['27352805', 'Homologous recombination (HR) of nuclear DNA occurs within the context of a  highly complex chromatin structure. Despite extensive studies of HR in diverse  organisms, mechanisms regulating HR within the chromatin context remain poorly  elucidated. Here we investigate the role and interplay of the histone chaperones  NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN1 (NAP1) and NAP1-RELATED PROTEIN (NRP) and the  ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor INOSITOL AUXOTROPHY80 (INO80) in  regulating somatic HR in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that simultaneous knockout  of the four AtNAP1 genes and the two NRP genes in the sextuple mutant m123456-1  barely affects normal plant growth and development. Interestingly, compared with  the respective AtNAP1 (m123-1 and m1234-1) or NRP (m56-1) loss-of-function  mutants, the sextuple mutant m123456-1 displays an enhanced plant  hypersensitivity to UV or bleomycin treatments. Using HR reporter constructs, we  show that AtNAP1 and NRP act in parallel to synergistically promote somatic HR.  Distinctively, the AtINO80 loss-of-function mutation (atino80-5) is epistatic to  m56-1 in plant phenotype and telomere length but hypostatic to m56-1 in HR  determinacy. Further analyses show that expression of HR machinery genes and  phosphorylation of H2A.X (gamma-H2A.X) are not impaired in the mutants. Collectively,  our study indicates that NRP and AtNAP1 synergistically promote HR upstream of  AtINO80-mediated chromatin remodeling after the formation of gamma-H2A.X foci during  DNA damage repair.', '2016 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13256', 'Shen']
