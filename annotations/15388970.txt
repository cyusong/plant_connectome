['15388970', 'Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) constitute a large family of signal perception  molecules. We characterized two highly homologous RLK genes, RLK902 and RKL1, in  Arabidopsis. RLK902 and RKL1 showed a 75% amino acid sequence identity over their  entire regions. In the RLK902 pro::GUS transgenic lines, GUS activity was strong  in the root tips, lateral root primordia, stipules, and floral organ abscission  zones, while the RKL1 promoter activity was dominant in the stomata cells,  hydathodes and trichomes of young rosette leaves, and floral organ abscission  zones. Neither the rlk902 mutant line, rkl1 mutant line nor rlk902/rkl1  double-knockout mutant line showed any significant phenotypes under normal growth  conditions. These results suggest that RLK902 and RKL1 might mediate the signal  transduction pathway in which at least one other complementary signaling pathway  to these two RLKs might exist.', '2004 Sep', 'Biosci Biotechnol Biochem', '10.1271/bbb.68.1935', 'Suzuki']
