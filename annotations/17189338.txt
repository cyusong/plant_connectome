Movement protein binding 2C (MPB2C) is a plant endogenous microtubule-associated protein previously identified as an interaction partner of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) mosaic virus movement protein (TMV-MP). In this work, the role of MPB2C in cell-to-cell transport of TMV-MP, viral spread of TMV, and subcellular localization of TMV-MP was examined. To this end, plants with reduced MPB2C levels were generated by a gene-silencing strategy. Local and systemic spread of TMV and cell-to-cell movement of TMV-MP were unimpaired in MPB2C-silenced plants as compared to nonsilenced plants, indicating that MPB2C is not required for intercellular transport of TMV-MP itself or spread of TMV. However, a clear change in subcellular distribution of TMV-MP characterized by a nearly complete loss of microtubular localization was observed in MPB2C-silenced plants. This result shows that the MPB2C is a central player in determining the complex subcellular localization of TMV-MP, in particular its microtubular accumulation, a phenomenon that has been frequently observed and whose role is still under discussion. Clearly, MPB2C mediated accumulation of TMV-MP at microtubules is not required for intercellular spread but may be a means to withdraw the TMV-MP from the cell-to-cell transport pathway.
