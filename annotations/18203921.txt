['18203921', 'KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) genes promote stem cell activity and must be  repressed to form determinate lateral organs. Stable KNOX gene silencing during  organogenesis is known to involve the predicted DNA binding proteins ASYMMETRIC  LEAVES1 (AS1) and AS2 as well as the chromatin-remodeling factor HIRA. However,  the mechanism of silencing is unknown. Here, we show that AS1 and AS2 form a  repressor complex that binds directly to the regulatory motifs CWGTTD and  KMKTTGAHW present at two sites in the promoters of the KNOX genes BREVIPEDICELLUS  (BP) and KNAT2. The two binding sites act nonredundantly, and interaction between  AS1-AS2 complexes at these sites is required to repress BP. Promoter deletion  analysis further indicates that enhancer elements required for BP expression in  the leaf are located between the AS1-AS2 complex binding sites. We propose that  AS1-AS2 complexes interact to create a loop in the KNOX promoter and, likely  through recruitment of HIRA, form a repressive chromatin state that blocks  enhancer activity during organogenesis. Our model for AS1-AS2-mediated KNOX gene  silencing is conceptually similar to the action of an insulator. This regulatory  mechanism may be conserved in simple leafed species of monocot and dicot lineages  and constitutes a potential key determinant in the evolution of compound leaves.', '2008 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.056127', 'Timmermans']
