Maize CycD3;1 associates to CDKA or CDKB1;1 proteins during germination and the complexes formed develop kinase activity. These complexes appear to vary in size as germination proceeds, suggesting association to different sets of proteins. CycD3;1 and associated CDK proteins respond to phytohormones and sucrose. Results revealed a reduction in the CycD3;1 protein amount along germination in the presence of indoleacetic acid (IAA) or abscisic acid (ABA), although in the latter protein levels recover at the end of germination. While the levels of CDKA increase with IAA, they decrease with ABA. Both phytohormones, IAA and ABA, increase levels of CDKB1;1 only during the early germination times. CycD3;1 associated kinase activity is only reduced by both phytohormones towards the end of the germination period. On the other hand, lack of sucrose in the imbibition medium strongly reduces CycD3;1 protein levels without affecting the levels of neither CDKA nor CDKB1;1. The corresponding CycD3;1 associated kinase activity is also severely decreased. The presence of sucrose in the medium appears to stabilize the CycD3;1 protein levels.
