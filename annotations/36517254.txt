Crop reproductive development is vulnerable to heat stress, and the genetic modulation of thermotolerance during the reproductive phase, especially the early stage, remains poorly understood. We isolated a Poaceae-specific FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYLS3 (FHY3)/FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 (FAR1)family transcription factor, Thermo-sensitive Spikelet Defects 1 (TSD1), derived from transposase in rice (Oryza sativa) TSD1 was highly expressed in spikelets, induced by heat, and specifically enhanced the thermotolerance of spikelet morphogenesis. Disrupting TSD1 did not affect vegetative growth but markedly retarded spikelet initiation and development, as well as caused varying degrees of spikelet degeneration, depending on the temperature. Most tsd1 spikelets were normal at low temperature but gradually degenerated as temperature increased, and all disappeared at high temperature, leading to naked branches. TSD1 directly promoted the transcription of YABBY1 and YABBY3 and could physically interact with YABBY1 and three TOB proteins, YABBY5, YABBY4, and YABBY3. These YABBY proteins can form either homodimers or heterodimers and play an important role in spikelet morphogenesis, similar to TSD1. Notably, the knockout mutant yab5-ko and double mutant tsd1 yab5-ko resembled tsd1 in spikelet appearance and response to temperature, indicating that these genes likely participate in spikelet development through the cooperative TSD1-YABBY module. These findings reveal a distinctive function of FHY3/FAR1 family genes and a unique TSD1-YABBY complex to acclimate spikelet development to high temperature in rice, providing insight into the regulating pathway of enhancing thermotolerance in plant reproductive development.
