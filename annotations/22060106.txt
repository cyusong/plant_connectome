['22060106', 'Angiosperm mitochondria encode approximately 20 group II introns, which interrupt  genes involved in the biogenesis and function of the respiratory chain.  Nucleus-encoded splicing factors have been identified for approximately half of  these introns. The splicing factors derive from several protein families defined  by atypical RNA binding domains that function primarily in organelles. We show  here that the Arabidopsis protein WTF9 is essential for the splicing of group II  introns in two mitochondrial genes for which splicing factors had not previously  been identified: rpl2 and ccmF(C). WTF9 harbors a recently recognized RNA binding  domain, the PORR domain, which was originally characterized in the chloroplast  splicing factor WTF1. These findings show that the PORR domain family also  functions in plant mitochondria, and highlight the parallels between the  machineries for group II intron splicing in plant mitochondria and chloroplasts.  In addition, we used the splicing defects in wtf9 mutants as a means to  functionally characterize the mitochondrial rpl2 and ccmF(C) genes. Loss of  ccmF(C) expression correlates with the loss of cytochromes c and c(1), confirming a  role for ccmF(C) in cytochrome biogenesis. By contrast, our results strongly  suggest that splicing is not essential for the function of the mitochondrial rpl2  gene, and imply that the Rpl2 fragment encoded by rpl2 exon 1 functions in  concert with a nuclear gene product that provides the remainder of this essential  ribosomal protein in trans.', '2012 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04849.x', 'Barkan']
