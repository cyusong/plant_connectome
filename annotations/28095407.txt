['28095407', 'Imprinted genes display biased expression of paternal and maternal alleles and  are only found in mammals and flowering plants. Compared to several hundred  imprinted genes that are functionally characterized in mammals, very few  imprinted genes were confirmed in plants and even fewer of them have been  functionally investigated. Here, we report a new imprinted gene, NUWA, in plants.  NUWA is an essential gene, because loss of its function resulted in reduced  transmission through the female gametophyte and defective cell/nuclear  proliferation in early Arabidopsis embryo and endosperm. NUWA is a maternally  expressed imprinted gene, as only the maternal allele of NUWA is transcribed and  translated from gametogenesis to the 16-cell globular embryo stage after  fertilization, and the de novo transcription of the maternal allele of NUWA  starts from the zygote stage. Different from other identified plant imprinted  genes whose encoded proteins are mostly localized to the nucleus, the NUWA  protein was localized to the mitochondria and was essential for mitochondria  function. Our work uncovers a novel imprinted gene of a previously unidentified  type, namely, a maternal-specific expressed nuclear gene with its encoded protein  localizing to and controlling the function of the maternally inherited  mitochondria. This reveals a unique mechanism of maternal control of the  mitochondria and adds an extra layer of complexity to the regulation of  nucleus-organelle coordination during early plant development.', '2017 Jan', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1006553', 'Qu']
