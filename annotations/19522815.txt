The role of jasmonic acid (JA) in plant wounding response has been demonstrated. However, the source of JA in wound signaling remains unclear. In the present study, pea seedlings were used as material to investigate the systemic induction of JA and the activation of lipoxygenase (LOX)-dependent octadecanoid pathway upon wounding. The results showed that endogenous JA could induce two peaks in the wounded leaves and the stalks, while only one peak in the systemic leaves. LOX activity and its protein amount were also induced and the stimulation mainly occurred in the late phase, while one peak of induction was present after pretreatment with JA. Applied nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of LOX activity, only inhibited the induction of JA in the late phase, and the resistance of pea was impaired. Furthermore, 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z), 11(E)-octadecadienoic acid (13(S)-H(P)ODE) was confirmed to be the main product of LOX throughout the experimental time. In addition, immunocytochemical analysis also revealed the occurrence of JA biosynthesis and transport upon wounding. These results demonstrated that wound-induced JA in wounded leaves resulted from its biosynthesis and conversion from its conjugates, while in systemic leaves resulted from its transport and biosynthesis; and proved that the LOX pathway was vital to the wound-induced defense response involved in JA biosynthesis.
