The <i>GLABROUS1 enhancer-binding protein (GeBP)</i> gene family encodes a typical transcription factor containing a noncanonical Leucine (Leu-)-zipper motif that plays an essential role in regulating plant growth and development, as well as responding to various stresses. However, limited information on the <i>GeBP</i> gene family is available in the case of the Gramineae crops. Here, 125 <i>GeBP</i> genes from nine Gramineae crops species were phylogenetically classified into four clades using bioinformatics analysis. Evolutionary analyses showed that whole genome duplication (WGD) and segmental duplication play important roles in the expansion of the <i>GeBP</i> gene family. The various gene structures and protein motifs revealed that the <i>GeBP</i> genes play diverse functions in plants. In addition, the expression profile analysis of the <i>GeBP</i> genes showed that 13 genes expressed in all tested organs and stages of development in rice, with especially high levels of expression in the leaf, palea, and lemma. Furthermore, the hormone- and metal-induced expression patterns showed that the expression levels of most genes were affected by various biotic stresses, implying that the <i>GeBP</i> genes had an important function in response to various biotic stresses. Furthermore, we confirmed that OsGeBP11 and OsGeBP12 were localized to the nucleus through transient expression in the rice protoplast, indicating that <i>GeBPs</i> function as transcription factors to regulate the expression of downstream genes. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the origin and evolutionary history of the <i>GeBP</i> genes family in Gramineae, and will be helpful in a further functional characterization of the <i>GeBP</i> genes.
