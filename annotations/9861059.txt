['9861059', 'Disease resistance in plants is often controlled by a gene-for-gene mechanism in  which avirulence (avr) gene products encoded by pathogens are specifically  recognized, either directly or indirectly, by plant disease resistance (R) gene  products. Members of the NBS-LRR class of R genes encode proteins containing a  putative nucleotide binding site (NBS) and carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeats  (LRRs). Generally, NBS-LRR proteins do not contain predicted transmembrane  segments or signal peptides, suggesting they are soluble cytoplasmic proteins.  RPM1 is an NBS-LRR protein from Arabidopsis thaliana that confers resistance to  Pseudomonas syringae expressing either avrRpm1 or avrB. RPM1 protein was  localized by using an epitope tag. In contrast to previous suggestions, RPM1 is a  peripheral membrane protein that likely resides on the cytoplasmic face of the  plasma membrane. Furthermore, RPM1 is degraded coincident with the onset of the  hypersensitive response, suggesting a negative feedback loop controlling the  extent of cell death and overall resistance response at the site of infection.', '1998 Dec 22', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.95.26.15849', 'Dangl']
