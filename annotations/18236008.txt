['18236008', 'Squalene synthase (SQS) catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of farnesyl  diphosphate (FPP) to produce squalene (SQ), the first committed precursor for  sterol, brassinosteroid, and triterpene biosynthesis. Arabidopsis thaliana  contains two SQS-annotated genomic sequences, At4g34640 (SQS1) and At4g34650  (SQS2), organized in a tandem array. Here we report that the SQS1 gene is widely  expressed in all tissues throughout plant development, whereas SQS2 is primarily  expressed in the vascular tissue of leaf and cotyledon petioles, and the  hypocotyl of seedlings. Neither the complete A. thaliana SQS2 protein nor the  chimeric SQS resulting from the replacement of the 69 C-terminal residues of SQS2  by the 111 C-terminal residues of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe SQS were able to  confer ergosterol prototrophy to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae erg9 mutant strain  lacking SQS activity. A soluble form of SQS2 expressed in Escherichia coli and  purified was unable to synthesize SQ from FPP in the presence of NADPH and either  Mg2+ or Mn2+. These results demonstrated that SQS2 has no SQS activity, so that  SQS1 is the only functional SQS in A. thaliana. Mutational studies revealed that  the lack of SQS activity of SQS2 cannot be exclusively attributed to the presence  of an unusual Ser replacing the highly conserved Phe at position 287. Expression  of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged versions of SQS1 in onion epidermal  cells demonstrated that SQS1 is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  membrane and that this location is exclusively dependent on the presence of the  SQS1 C-terminal hydrophobic trans-membrane domain.', '2008 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-008-9299-3', 'Ferrer']
