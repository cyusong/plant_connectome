['31944575', 'The balance between cellular carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) must be tightly  coordinated to sustain optimal growth and development in plants. In chloroplasts,  photosynthesis converts inorganic C to organic C, which is important for  maintenance of C content in plant cells. However, little is known about the role  of chloroplasts in C/N balance. Here, we identified a nuclear-encoded protein LOW  PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY2 (LPE2) that it is required for photosynthesis and C/N  balance in Arabidopsis. LPE2 is specifically localized in the chloroplast. Both  loss-of-function mutants, lpe2-1 and lpe2-2, showed lower photosynthetic  activity, characterized by slower electron transport and lower PSII quantum yield  than the wild type. Notably, LPE2 is predicted to encode the plastid ribosomal  protein S21 (RPS21). Deficiency of LPE2 significantly perturbed the thylakoid  membrane composition and plastid protein accumulation, although the transcription  of plastid genes is not affected obviously. More interestingly, transcriptome  analysis indicated that the loss of LPE2 altered the expression of C and N  response related genes in nucleus, which is confirmed by quantitative  real-time-polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, deficiency of LPE2 suppressed the  response of C/N balance in physiological level. Taken together, our findings  suggest that LPE2 plays dual roles in photosynthesis and the response to C/N  balance.', '2020 Sep', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.12907', 'Jin']
