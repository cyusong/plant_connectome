['19636801', 'Obg is a ribosome-associated GTPase essential for bacterial viability and is  conserved in most organisms, from bacteria to eukaryotes. Obg is also expressed  in plants, which predicts an important role for this molecule in plant viability;  however, the functions of the plant Obg homologs have not been reported. Here, we  first identified Arabidopsis AtObgC as a plant chloroplast-targeting Obg and  elucidated its molecular biological and physiological properties. AtObgC encodes  a plant-specific Obg GTPase that contains an N-terminal region for chloroplast  targeting and has intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity. A targeting assay using a  few AtObgC N-terminal truncation mutants revealed that AtObgC localizes to  chloroplasts and its transit peptide consists of more than 50 amino acid  residues. Interestingly, GFP-fused full-length AtObgC exhibited a punctate  staining pattern in chloroplasts of Arabidopsis protoplasts, which suggests a  dimerization or multimerization of AtObgC. Moreover, its Obg fold was  indispensable for the generation of the punctate staining pattern, and thus, was  supposed to be important for such oligomerization of AtObgC by mediating the  protein-protein interaction. In addition, the T-DNA insertion AtObgC null mutant  exhibited an embryonic lethal phenotype that disturbed the early stage of  embryogenesis. Altogether, our results provide a significant implication that  AtObgC as a chloroplast targeting GTPase plays an important role at the early  embryogenesis by exerting its function in chloroplast protein synthesis.', '2009 Nov', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-009-9529-3', 'Bahk']
