The ABCG10 protein of the model legume Medicago truncatula is required for efficient de novo production of the phenylpropanoid-derived phytoalexin medicarpin. Silencing the expression of MtABCG10 results, inter alia, in a lower accumulation of medicarpin and its precursors. In this study, we demonstrate that the impairment of medicarpin biosynthesis can be partially averted by the exogenous application of 4-coumarate, an early precursor of the core phenylpropanoid pathway, and the deoxyisoflavonoid formononetin. Experiments conducted using HPLC/MS in a heterologous system as well as in vitro transport assays with labelled substrate revealed that MtABCG10 is responsible for the membrane translocation of 4-coumarate and liquiritigenin, molecules representing key branching points in the phenylpropanoid pathway. The identification of transporters participating in the distribution of precursors is an important step in understanding phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.
