Nitrate signaling improves plant growth under limited nitrate availability and, hence, optimal resource use for crop production. Whereas several transcriptional regulators of nitrate signaling have been identified, including the Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor NIN-LIKE PROTEIN7 (NLP7), additional regulators are expected to fine-tune this pivotal physiological response. Here, we characterized Arabidopsis NLP2 as a top-tier transcriptional regulator of the early nitrate response gene regulatory network. NLP2 interacts with NLP7 in vivo and shares key molecular features such as nitrate-dependent nuclear localization, DNA binding motif, and some target genes with NLP7. Genetic, genomic, and metabolic approaches revealed a specific role for NLP2 in the nitrate-dependent regulation of carbon and energy-related processes that likely influence plant growth under distinct nitrogen environments. Our findings highlight the complementarity and specificity of NLP2 and NLP7 in orchestrating a multi-tiered nitrate regulatory network that links nitrate assimilation with carbon and energy metabolism for efficient nitrogen use and biomass production.
