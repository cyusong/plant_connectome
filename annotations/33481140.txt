['33481140', 'IEF, a novel plasma plasma membrane protein, is important for exine formation in  Arabidopsis. Exine, an important part of pollen wall, is crucial for male  fertility. The major component of exine is sporopollenin which are synthesized  and secreted by tapetum. Although sporopollenin synthesis has been well studied,  the transportation of it remains elusive. To understand it, we analyzed the gene  expression pattern in tapetal microdissection data, and investigated the  potential transporter genes that are putatively regulated by ABORTED MICROSPORES  (AMS). Among these genes, we identified IMPERFECTIVE EXINE FORMATION (IEF) that  is important for exine formation. Compared to the wild type, ief mutants exhibit  severe male sterility and pollen abortion, suggesting IEF is crucial for pollen  development and male fertility. Using both scanning and transmission electron  microscopes, we showed that exine structure was not well defined in ief mutant.  The transient expression of IEF-GFP driven by the 35S promoter indicated that  IEF-GFP was localized in plasma membrane. Furthermore, AMS can specifically  activate the expression of promoterIEF:LUC in vitro, which suggesting AMS  regulates IEF for exine formation. The expression of ATP-BINDING CASSETTE  TRANSPORTER G26 (AGCB26) was not affected in ief mutants. In addition, SEM and  TEM data showed that the sporopollenin deposition is more defective in  abcg26/ief-2 than that of in abcg26, which suggesting that IEF is involved in an  independent sporopollenin transportation pathway. This work reveal a novel gene,  IEF regulated by AMS that is essential for exine formation.', '2021 Apr', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-020-01114-8', 'Gao']
