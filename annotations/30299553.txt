Collective evidence from agricultural practices and from scientific research has demonstrated that plants can alter their phenotypic responses to repeated biotic and abiotic stresses or their elicitors. A coordinated reaction at the organismal, cellular, and genome levels has suggested that plants can "remember" an earlier stress and modify their future responses, accordingly. Stress memory may increase a plant's survival chances by improving its tolerance/avoidance abilities and may provide a mechanism for acclimation and adaptation. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate plant stress memory is not only an intellectually challenging topic but has important implications for agricultural practices as well. Here, I focus exclusively on specific aspects of the transcription memory in response to recurring dehydration stresses and the memory-type responses to insect damage in a process known as "priming." The questions discussed are (a) whether/how the two memory phenomena are connected at the level of transcriptional regulation; (b) how differential transcription is achieved mechanistically under a repeated stress; and (c) whether similar molecular and/or epigenetic mechanisms are involved. Possible biological relevance of transcriptional stress memory and its preservation in plant evolution are also discussed.
