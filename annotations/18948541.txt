['18948541', 'During the development of multicellular organisms, organogenesis and pattern  formation depend on formative divisions to specify and maintain pools of stem  cells. In higher plants, these activities are essential to shape the final root  architecture because the functioning of root apical meristems and the de novo  formation of lateral roots entirely rely on it. We used transcript profiling on  sorted pericycle cells undergoing lateral root initiation to identify the  receptor-like kinase ACR4 of Arabidopsis as a key factor both in promoting  formative cell divisions in the pericycle and in constraining the number of these  divisions once organogenesis has been started. In the root tip meristem, ACR4  shows a similar action by controlling cell proliferation activity in the  columella cell lineage. Thus, ACR4 function reveals a common mechanism of  formative cell division control in the main root tip meristem and during lateral  root initiation.', '2008 Oct 24', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1160158', 'Beeckman']
