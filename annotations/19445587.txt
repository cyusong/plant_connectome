Nitric oxide (NO) is an essential regulatory molecule in plant immunity in synergy with reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, little is known about the role of NO in disease resistance to necrotrophic pathogens. NO and oxidative bursts were induced during necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea and Nicotiana benthamiana compatible interaction. Histochemical analyses showed that both NO and ROS were produced in adjacent cells of invaded areas in N. benthamiana leaves. Activation of salicylic acid-induced protein kinase, which regulates the radical burst, and several defense-related genes were induced after inoculation of B. cinerea. Loss-of-function analyses using inhibitors and virus-induced gene silencing were done to investigate the role of the radical burst in pathogenesis. We showed that NO plays a pivotal role in basal defense against B. cinerea and PR-1 gene expression in N. benthamiana. By contrast, ROS function has a negative role in resistance or has a positive role in expansion of disease lesions during B. cinerea-N. benthamiana interaction.
