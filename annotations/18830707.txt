The mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) profile of a rice-field cyanobacterium, Anabaena doliolum, was studied under PAR and PAR + UVR conditions. The high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of water-soluble compounds reveals the biosynthesis of three MAAs, mycosporine-glycine (lambda (max) = 310 nm), porphyra-334 (lambda (max) = 334 nm) and shinorine (lambda (max) = 334 nm), with retention times of 4.1, 3.5 and 2.3 min, respectively. This is the first report for the occurrence of mycosporine-glycine and porphyra-334 in addition to shinorine in Anabaena strains studied so far. The results indicate that mycosporine-glycine (monosubstituted) acts as a precursor for the biosynthesis of the bisubstituted MAAs shinorine and porphyra-334. Mycosporine-glycine was under constitutive control while porphyra-334 and shinorine were induced by UV-B radiation, indicating the involvement of UV-regulated enzymes in the biotransformation of MAAs. It seems that A. doliolum is able to protect its cell machinery from UVR by synthesizing a complex set of MAAs and thus is able to survive successfully during the summer in its natural brightly lit habitats.
