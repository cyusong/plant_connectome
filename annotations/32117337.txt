Abscisic acid-, stress-, and ripening-induced (<i>ASR</i>) genes are involved in responding to abiotic stresses, but their precise roles in enhancing grain yield under stress conditions remain to be determined. We cloned a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>ASR</i> gene, <i>OsASR1</i>, and characterized its function in rice plants. <i>OsASR1</i> expression was induced by abscisic acid (ABA), salt, and drought treatments. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing <i>OsASR1</i> displayed improved water regulation under salt and drought stresses, which was associated with osmolyte accumulation, improved modulation of stomatal closure, and reduced transpiration rates. <i>OsASR1</i>-overexpressing plants were hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and accumulated higher endogenous ABA levels under salt and drought stresses, indicating that <i>OsASR1</i> is a positive regulator of the ABA signaling pathway. The growth of <i>OsASR1</i>-overexpressing plants was superior to that of wild-type (WT) plants under paddy field conditions when irrigation was withheld, likely due to improved modulation of stomatal closure <i>via</i> modified ABA signaling. The transgenic plants had higher grain yields than WT plants for four consecutive generations. We conclude that <i>OsASR1</i> has a crucial role in ABA-mediated regulation of stomatal closure to conserve water under salt- and drought-stress conditions, and <i>OsASR1</i> overexpression can enhance salinity and drought tolerance, resulting in improved crop yields.
