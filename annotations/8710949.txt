['8710949', 'Reestablishment of the resting state after stimulus-coupled elevations of  cytosolic-free Ca2+ requires the rapid removal of Ca2+ from the cytosol of plant  cells. Here we describe the isolation of two genes, CAX1 and CAX2, from  Arabidopsis thaliana that suppress a mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that has  a defect in vacuolar Ca2+ accumulation. Both genes encode polypeptides showing  sequence similarities to microbial H+/Ca2+ antiporters. Experiments on vacuolar  membrane-enriched vesicles isolated from yeast expressing CAX1 or CAX2  demonstrate that these genes encode high efficiency and low efficiency H+/Ca2+  exchangers, respectively. The properties of the CAX1 gene product indicate that  it is the high capacity transporter responsible for maintaining low  cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentrations in plant cells by catalyzing pH  gradient-energized vacuolar Ca2+ accumulation.', '1996 Aug 6', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.93.16.8782', 'Fink']
