TALE homeodomain proteins regulate development in many eukaryotes. Now, Lee et al. (2008) report that two TALE homeodomain proteins control zygote development of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas. This implicates TALE gene loss and diversification in the evolution of new diploid body plans that appeared when land plants evolved from algal ancestors over 450 million years ago.
