Yield losses due to nutrient deficiency are estimated as the primary cause of the yield gap worldwide. Understanding how plant roots perceive external nutrient status and elaborate morphological adaptations in response to it is necessary to develop reliable strategies to increase crop yield. In the last decade, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were shown to be key players of the mechanisms underlying root responses to nutrient limitation. ROS contribute in multiple ways to shape the root system in response to nutritional cues, both as direct effectors acting on cell wall architecture and as second messengers in signalling pathways. Here, we review the mutual interconnections existing between perception and signalling of the most common forms of the major macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), and ROS in shaping plant root system architecture. We discuss recent advances in dissecting the integration of these elements and their impact on morphological traits of the root system, highlighting the functional ductility of ROS and enzymes implied in ROS metabolism, such as class III peroxidases.
