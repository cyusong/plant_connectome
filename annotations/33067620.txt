The protein family of mTERFs (mitochondrial transcription termination factors) was initially studied in mammalian and insect mitochondria before the first Arabidopsis mTERF mutant was characterized. More than 10 years of research on the function of plant mTERFs in the flowering plants Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays and the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has since highlighted that mTERFs are key regulators of organellar gene expression (OGE) in mitochondria and in chloroplasts. Additional functions to be fulfilled by plant mTERFs (e.g. splicing) and the fact that the expression of two organellar genomes had to be facilitated have led to a massive expansion of the plant mTERF portfolio compared to that found in mammals. Plant mTERFs are implicated in all steps of OGE ranging from the modulation of transcription to the maturation of tRNAs and hence translation. Furthermore, being regulators of OGE, mTERFs are required for a successful long-term acclimation to abiotic stress, retrograde signaling and interorganellar communication. Here, I review the recent progress in the elucidation of molecular mTERF functions.

mTERFs: !regulate! OGE 
mTERFs: !modulate! transcription 
mTERFs: !facilitate! expression of two organellar genomes 
mTERFs: !splice! tRNAs 
mTERFs: !required for! long-term acclimation to abiotic stress 
mTERFs: !involved in! retrograde signaling 
mTERFs: !mediate! interorganellar communication
