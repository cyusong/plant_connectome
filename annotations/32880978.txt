Plants use a variety of signals to control root development, including in modifying root development in response to nutrient stress. For example, in response to nitrogen (N) stress, plants dramatically modulate root development, including the formation of N-fixing nodules in legumes. Recently, specific CLE peptides and/or receptors important for their perception, including CLV1 and CLV2, have been found to play roles in root development, including in response to N supply. In the legume Medicago truncatula, this response also appears to be influenced by RDN1, a member of the hydroxyproline-O-arabinosyltransferase (HPAT) family which can modify specific CLE peptides. However, it is not known if this signalling pathway plays a central role in root development across species, and in particular root responses to N. In this study, we systematically examined the role of the CLV signalling pathway genes in root development of the legume pea (Pisum sativum) and non-legume tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) using a mutant-based approach. This included a detailed examination of root development in response to N in tomato mutants disrupted in CLV1- or CLV2-like genes or HPAT family member FIN. We found no evidence for a role of these genes in pea seedling root development. Furthermore, the CLV1-like FAB gene did not influence tomato root development, including the root response to N supply. In contrast, both CLV2 and the HPAT gene FIN appear to positively influence root size in tomato but do not mediate root responses to N. These results suggest the function of these genes may vary somewhat in different species, including the N regulation of root architecture.
