The Orchidaceae, otherwise known as orchids, is one of the largest plant families and is renowned for its spectacular flowers and ecological adaptations. Various polymorphisms of orchid flower colour can attract pollinators and be recognised as valuable horticultural ornamentals. As one of the longest historic cultured orchids, <i>Cymbidium kanran</i> has been domesticated for more than 2,500 years and is an ideal species to study coloration mechanisms because of plentiful variations in floral coloration and abundant traditional varieties. In this study, we used two distinct colour-type flowers of <i>C. kanran</i> as experimental materials to elucidate the mechanism of flower coloration. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that anthocyanins in purple-red-type flowers include three types of anthocyanidin aglycones, peonidin, malvidin, and cyanidin, whereas anthocyanins are lacking in white-type flowers. Through comparative transcriptome sequencing, 102 candidate genes were identified as putative homologues of colour-related genes. Based on comprehensive correlation analysis between colour-related compounds and gene expression profiles, four candidates from 102 captured genes showed a positive correlation with anthocyanidin biosynthesis. Furthermore, transient expression of <i>CkCHS-1, CkDFR</i>, and <i>CkANS</i> by particle bombardment confirmed that recovery of their expression completed the anthocyanin pathway and produced anthocyanin compounds in white-type flowers. Collectively, this study provided a comprehensive transcriptomic dataset for <i>Cymbidium</i>, which significantly facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of regulating floral pigment accumulation in orchids.
