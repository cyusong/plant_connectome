Buoyancy changes of the cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens- the Burgundy-blood alga - were modelled from its buoyancy response to light and irradiance changes in Lake Zürich during autumnal mixing. The daily insolation received by filaments at fixed depths and circulating to different depths was calculated from the measured light attenuation and surface irradiance. The active mixing depth, za5, was determined from the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient, Kz, calculated from the wind speed, heat flux and temperature gradients. The fixed depth resulting in filament buoyancy, zn, decreased from 13 to 2 m between August and December 1998; the critical depth for buoyancy, zq, to which filaments must be circulated to become buoyant, decreased from >60 m in the summer to <10 m in winter. When za5 first exceeded zn, in September, P. rubescens was mixed into the epilimnion. In October, zq > za5: circulating filaments would have lost buoyancy in the high insolation. Often in November and December, after deeper mixing and lower insolation, za5 > zq: filaments would have become buoyant but would have floated to the lake surface (the Burgundy-blood phenomenon) only under subsequent calm conditions, when Kz was low. The model explains the Burgundy-blood phenomenon in deeper lakes; waterblooms near shallow leeward shores arise from populations floating up in deeper regions of the lake.
