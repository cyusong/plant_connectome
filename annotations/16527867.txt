['16527867', "NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a Krebs cycle enzyme situated in  mitochondria. In Arabidopsis thaliana, five genes encode functional IDH subunits  that can be classed into two groups based on gene structure and subunit amino  acid sequence. Arabidopsis contains two 'catalytic' and three 'regulatory'  subunits according to their homology with yeast IDH. To date, an active IDH is  believed to be heteromeric, containing at least one of each subunit type. This  was verified in Arabidopsis by the complementation of yeast IDH mutants with the  different Arabidopsis IDH-encoding cDNAs. Indeed, a single 'catalytic' and  'regulatory' subunit was sufficient to restore acetate growth of the yeast IDH  double mutant. To gain information on possible IDH subunit interactions in  planta, Arabidopsis IDH gene expression was analysed by Northern blot, PCR on  cDNA libraries, in silico and in 'promoter'-reporter gene transgenic plants. Four  of the IDH genes were expressed in all plant organs tested, while one gene  (At4g35650) was not expressed in vegetative organs but was mainly expressed in  the pollen. In leaves, the IDH genes were highly expressed in the veins, and to a  lesser extent in mesophyll cells. The data are discussed with respect to IDH in  other plant species.", '2006 May', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcj030', 'Hodges']
