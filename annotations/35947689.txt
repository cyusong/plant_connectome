Linarin (acacetin-7-O-rutinoside), isorhoifolin (apigenin-7-O-rutinoside), and diosmin (diosmetin-7-O-rutinoside) are chemically and structurally similar flavone rutinoside (FR) compounds found in Chrysanthemum L. (Anthemideae, Asteraceae) plants. However, their biosynthetic pathways remain largely unknown. In this study, we cloned and compared FRs and genes encoding rhamnosyltransferases (RhaTs) among eight accessions of Chrysanthemum polyploids. We also biochemically characterized RhaTs of Chrysanthemum plants and Citrus (Citrus sinensis and Citrus maxima). RhaTs from these two genera are substrate-promiscuous enzymes catalyzing the rhamnosylation of flavones, flavanones, and flavonols. Substrate specificity analysis revealed that Chrysanthemum 1,6RhaTs preferred flavone glucosides (e.g. acacetin-7-O-glucoside), whereas Cs1,6RhaT preferred flavanone glucosides. The nonsynonymous substitutions of RhaTs found in some cytotypes of diploids resulted in the loss of catalytic function. Phylogenetic analysis and specialized pathways responsible for the biosynthesis of major flavonoids in Chrysanthemum and Citrus revealed that rhamnosylation activity might share a common evolutionary origin. Overexpression of RhaT in hairy roots resulted in 13-, 2-, and 5-fold increases in linarin, isorhoifolin, and diosmin contents, respectively, indicating that RhaT is mainly involved in the biosynthesis of linarin. Our findings not only suggest that the substrate promiscuity of RhaTs contributes to the diversity of FRs in Chrysanthemum species but also shed light on the evolution of flavone and flavanone rutinosides in distant taxa.
