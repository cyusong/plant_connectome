Peptide signaling regulates a variety of developmental processes and environmental responses in plants. For example, the peptide systemin induces the systemic defense response in tomato and defensins are small cysteine-rich proteins that are involved in the innate immune system of plants. The CLAVATA3 peptide regulates meristem size and the SCR peptide is the pollen self-incompatibility recognition factor in the Brassicaceae. LURE peptides produced by synergid cells attract pollen tubes to the embryo sac. RALFs are a recently discovered family of plant peptides that play a role in plant cell growth.
