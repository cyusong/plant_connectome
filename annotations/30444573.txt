Plant phenotypes are the result of both genetic and environmental forces that act to modulate trait expression. Over the last few years, numerous approaches in functional genomics and systems biology have led to a greater understanding of plant phenotypic variation and plant responses to the environment. These approaches, and the questions that they can address, have been loosely termed evolutionary and ecological functional genomics (EEFG), and have been providing key insights on how plants adapt and evolve. In particular, by bringing these studies from the laboratory to the field, EEFG studies allow us to gain greater knowledge of how plants function in their natural contexts.
