Wood biomass is mainly made of secondary cell walls, whose formation is controlled by a multilevel network. The tandem CCCH zinc finger (TZF) proteins involved in plant secondary wall formation are poorly understood. Two TZF genes, PdC3H17 and PdC3H18, were isolated from Populus deltoides and functionally characterized in Escherichia coli, tobacco, Arabidopsis and poplar. PdC3H17 and PdC3H18 are predominantly expressed in cells of developing wood, and the proteins they encode are targeted to cytoplasmic foci. Transcriptional activation assays showed that PdMYB2/3/20/21 individually activated the PdC3H17 and PdC3H18 promoters, but PdMYB3/21 were most significant. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that PdMYB3/21 bound directly to the PdC3H17/18 promoters. Overexpression of PdC3H17/18 in poplar increased secondary xylem width and secondary wall thickening in stems, whereas dominant repressors of them had the opposite effects on these traits. Similar alteration in secondary wall thickening was observed in their transgenic Arabidopsis plants. qRT-PCR results showed that PdC3H17/18 regulated the expression of cellulose, xylan and lignin biosynthetic genes, and several wood-associated MYB genes. These results demonstrate that PdC3H17 and PdC3H18 are the targets of PdMYB3 and PdMYB21 and are an additional two components in the regulatory network of secondary xylem formation in poplar.
