In our recent paper in Plant Journal, we described the transcriptional activation of AtTMPK (thymidylate kinase),1 a recognized G(1)/S phase marker of the cell cycle progression and its role in early seed development. Here, we compare our conclusions on the regulation of AtTMPK and those of other genes participating in DNA replication, including DPB2, a subunit of the DNA polymerase epsilon complex.2 Although, the dual localisation of AtTMPK in the cytosol and mitochondria seems to be unique to plants, this phenomenon of multiple targeting is also used for other proteins involved in DNA replication, such as DNA ligase 1 (AtLIG1), and may represent a way to coordinate nuclear and organellar divisions.
