Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the most important energy storage form in oilseed crops. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the Kennedy pathway of TAG biosynthesis. To date, little is known about the regulation of DGAT activity in peanut (Arachis hypogaea), an agronomically important oilseed crop that is cultivated in many parts of the world. In this study, seven distinct forms of type 1 DGAT (AhDGAT1.1-AhDGAT1.7) were identified, cloned, and characterized. Comparisons of the nucleotide sequences and gene structures revealed many different splicing variants of AhDGAT1, some of which displayed different organ-specific expression patterns. A representative gene (AhDGAT1.1) was transformed into wild-type tobacco and was shown to increase seed fatty acid (FA) content by 14.7%-20.9%. All seven AhDGAT1s were expressed in TAG-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain H1246; the five longest AhDGAT1 variants generated high levels of acyltransferase activity and complemented the free fatty acid lethality phenotype in this strain. The alternative splicing that gives rise to AhDGAT1.2 and AhDGAT1.4 creates predicted protein C-terminal truncations. The proteins encoded by these two variants were not active and did not complement the fatty acid sensitivity in H1246. These results were verified by visualization of intracellular lipid droplets using Nile Red staining. Collectively, the results presented here represent the first comprehensive analysis of the peanut DGAT1 gene family, which, unlike in other published plant DGAT1 sequences, shows widespread alternative splicing that may affect the expression patterns and enzyme activities of some members of the gene family.
