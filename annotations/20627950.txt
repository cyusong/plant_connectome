['20627950', 'AtSTP14, a new Arabidopsis sugar transporter, was identified and characterized on  the molecular and physiological level. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses and  reporter plants demonstrate high AtSTP14 expression levels in the seed endosperm  and in cotyledons, as well as in green leaves. Thus, unlike previously  characterized monosaccharide transporters, AtSTP14 is expressed in both source  and sink tissues and represents the first monosaccharide transporter in the  female gametophyte. Heterologous expression in yeast revealed that AtSTP14 does  not transport glucose or fructose, but is the first plant transporter specific  for galactose. Interestingly, AtSTP14 expression is regulated by factors which  also induce cell wall degradation such as extended dark periods or changes in the  sugar level, i.e. AtSTP14 is induced 3-fold by 24 h darkness and repressed 3-fold  by 2% glucose and 2% sucrose. Two independent Atstp14 mutant lines were  identified, but no effect on seed development or other differences during growth  under normal conditions could be observed. A putative role for AtSTP14 in the  recycling of cell wall-derived galactose during different developmental processes  is discussed.', '2010 Sep', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcq100', 'Buttner']
