Ethylene has long been regarded as a stress-related hormone, but only recently the link between ethylene signaling pathway and salt stress was primarily established. Ethylene signaling modulates salt response at different levels, including membrane receptors, components in cytoplasm, and nuclear transcription factors in the pathway. However the relevant mechanism is still unclear. In this paper, we described how ethylene signaling pathway regulates salt stress response and discussed the challenges of ethylene and receptor signaling in salt response regulation.
