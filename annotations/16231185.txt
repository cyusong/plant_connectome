['16231185', 'The Arabidopsis GIGANTEA (GI) gene has been shown to regulate several  developmental processes, including photoperiod-mediated flowering, phytochrome B  signaling, circadian clock, and carbohydrate metabolism. However, little is known  about the role of GI gene in mediating the cold stress response. Here, we show  that GI gene is involved in mediating the cold stress response. GI gene was  induced by cold stress, but not by salt, mannitol, and abscisic acid. Moreover,  gi-3 plants showed an increased sensitivity to freezing stress. However, no  significant differences were detected in the transcript levels of CBF genes CBF1,  CBF2, and CBF3 as well as their targeted genes RD29A, COR15A, KIN1, and KIN2  between wild-type and gi-3 plants in response to cold stress. These results  suggest that GI gene positively regulates freezing tolerance via a  CBF-independent pathway. In addition, intermittent cold treatments had a greater  effect on flowering time in gi-3 plants than that in wild-type plants, suggesting  that there may be a link between flowering time and cold stress response through  GI in Arabidopsis.', '2005 Dec', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-005-0061-x', 'Jiang']
