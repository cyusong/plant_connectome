Prior to flower opening, mesophyll cells at the vascular bundles of Dendrobium tepals showed a large increase in vacuolar volume, partially at the expense of the cytoplasm. Electron micrographs indicated that this increase in vacuolar volume was mainly due to vacuole fusion. Macroautophagous structures typical of plant cells were observed. Only a small part of the decrease in cytoplasmic volume seemed due to macroautophagy. The vacuoles contained vesicles of various types, including multilamellar bodies. It was not clear if these vacuolar inclusions were due to macroautophagy or microautophagy. Only a single structure was observed of a protruding vacuole, indicating microautophagy. It is concluded that macroautophagy occurs in these cells but its role in vacuole formation seems small, while a possible role of microautophagy in vacuole formation might be hypothesized. Careful labeling of organelle membranes seems required to advance our insight in plant macro- and microautophagy and their roles in vacuole formation.
