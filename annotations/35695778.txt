Sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) homeostasis is essential for plant survival in saline soils. A member of the High-Affinity K+ Transporter (HKT) family in rice (Oryza sativa), OsHKT1;1, is a vital regulator of Na+ exclusion from shoots and is bound by a MYB transcription factor (OsMYBc). Here, we generated transgenic rice lines in the oshkt1;1 mutant background for genetic complementation using genomic OsHKT1;1 containing a native (Com) or mutated (mCom) promoter that cannot be bound by OsMYBc. In contrast to wild-type (WT) or Com lines, the mCom lines were not able to recover the salt-sensitive phenotype of oshkt1;1. The OsMYBc-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to salt stress than WT plants. A yeast two-hybrid screen using the OsMYBc N-terminus as bait identified a rice MYBc stress-related RING finger protein (OsMSRFP). OsMSRFP is an active E3 ligase that ubiquitinated OsMYBc in vitro and mediated 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of OsMYBc under semi-in vitro and in vivo conditions. OsMSRFP attenuated OsMYBc-mediated OsHKT1;1 expression, and knockout of OsMSRFP led to rice salt tolerance. These findings uncover a regulatory mechanism of salt response that fine-tunes OsHKT1;1 transcription by ubiquitination of OsMYBc.
