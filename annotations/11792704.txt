['11792704', 'A number of Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane-bound oxidoreductases were examined  for potential roles in microsomal fatty acid elongation, by assaying heterologous  elongating activities in individual deletion mutants. One yeast gene, YBR159w,  was identified as being required for activity of both the Caenorhabditis elegans  elongase PEA1 (F56H11.4) and the Arabidopsis thaliana elongase FAE1. Ybr159p  shows some limited homology to human steroid dehydrogenases and is a member of  the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily. Disruption of YBR159w is not  lethal, in contrast to previous reports, although the mutants are slow growing  and display high temperature sensitivity. Both Ybr159p and an Arabidopsis  homologue were shown to restore heterologous elongase activities when expressed  in ybr159Delta mutants. Biochemical characterization of microsomal preparations  from ybr159Delta cells revealed a primary perturbation in beta-ketoacyl  reduction, confirming the assignment of YBR159w as encoding a component of the  microsomal elongase.', '2002 Mar 29', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M111441200', 'Napier']
