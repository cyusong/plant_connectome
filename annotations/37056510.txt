The grain aphid <i>Sitobion miscanthi</i> is a serious pest of wheat that causes severe economic damage by sucking phloem sap and transmitting plant viruses. Here, two putative salivary effector homologs from <i>S. miscanthi</i> (Sm10 and SmC002) were selected based on sequence similarity to other characterized aphid candidate effectors. These effectors were then delivered into wheat cells separately <i>via</i> the type III secretion system of <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> to elucidate their functions in the regulation of plant defenses and host fitness. The results showed that the delivery of either Sm10 or SmC002 into wheat plants significantly suppressed callose deposition and affected the transcript levels of callose synthase genes. The expression levels of salicylic acid (SA)-associated defense genes were upregulated significantly in wheat leaves carrying either Sm10 or SmC002. Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that wheat SA levels significantly increased after the delivery of the two effectors. The results of aphid bioassays conducted on the wheat plants carrying Sm10 or SmC002 showed significant increases in the survival and fecundity of <i>S. miscanthi</i>. This study demonstrated that the Sm10 and SmC002 salivary effectors of <i>S. miscanthi</i> enhanced host plant susceptibility and benefited <i>S. miscanthi</i> performance by regulating wheat defense signaling pathways.
