We analyzed the ability of plant mitochondria to process introduced RNA. Arabidopsis thaliana cox2 transcripts were synthesized in vitro. The in vitro transcribed mRNA was electroporated into maize and cauliflower mitochondria and incubated in organello. RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was carried out to analyze RNA processing. Our data indicate that cox2 transcripts introduced into isolated plant mitochondria are processed completely. This is the first report of in organello editing of introduced transcripts. We also found that none of the transcription, translation, or respiration inhibitors we used influenced RNA splicing or RNA editing of the cox2 transcript. Thus, our data also demonstrate that plant mitochondrial RNA processing may be independent of both transcription and respiratory regulation.
