Wheat stem rust is caused by <i>Puccinia graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i>. This major disease has been effectively controlled via resistance genes since the 1970s. The appearance and spread of new races of <i>P</i>. <i>graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (eg., Ug99, TKTTF, and TTRTF) have renewed the interest in identifying the resistance gene and breeding cultivars resistant to wheat stem rust. In this study, gene postulation, pedigree analysis, and molecular detection were used to determine the presence of stem rust resistance genes in 65 commercial wheat cultivars from Hebei Province. In addition, two predominant races 21C3CTHTM and 34MRGQM were used to evaluate the resistance of these cultivars at the adult-plant stage in 2021-2022. The results revealed that 6 <i>Sr</i> genes (namely, <i>Sr5</i>, <i>Sr17</i>, <i>Sr24</i>, <i>Sr31</i>, <i>Sr32</i>, <i>Sr38</i>, and <i>SrTmp</i>), either singly or in combination, were identified in 46 wheat cultivars. Overall, 37 wheat cultivars contained <i>Sr31</i>. <i>Sr5</i> and <i>Sr17</i> were present in 3 and 3 cultivars, respectively. Gao 5218 strong gluten, Jie 13-Ji 7369, and Kenong 1006 contained <i>Sr24</i>, <i>Sr32</i>, and <i>Sr38</i>, respectively. No wheat cultivar contained <i>Sr25</i> and <i>Sr26.</i> In total, 50 (76.9%) wheat cultivars were resistant to all tested races of <i>P</i>. <i>graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> in field test in 2021-2022. This study is important for breeding wheat cultivars with resistance to stem rust.
