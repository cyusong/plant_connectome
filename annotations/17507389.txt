In gametophytic cells (prothalli) of the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris, nuclei as well as chloroplasts change their position according to light conditions. Nuclei reside on anticlinal walls in darkness and move to periclinal or anticlinal walls under weak or strong light conditions, respectively. Here we reveal that red light-induced nuclear movement is mediated by neochrome1 (neo1), blue light-induced movement is redundantly mediated by neo1, phototropin2 (phot2) and possibly phot1, and dark positioning of both nuclei and chloroplasts is mediated by phot2. Thus, both the nuclear and chloroplast photorelocation movements share common photoreceptor systems.

neo1: !mediates! red light-induced nuclear movement
neo1, phot2, phot1: !redundantly mediate! blue light-induced nuclear movement
phot2: !mediates! dark positioning of nuclei and chloroplasts
