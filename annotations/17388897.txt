The causal relationships among ethylene emission, oxidative burst and tissue damage, and the temporal expression patterns of some ethylene biosynthetic and responsive genes, were examined in the Never ripe (Nr) tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) mutant and its isogenic wild type (cv. Pearson), to investigate the role played by the ethylene receptor LE-ETR3 (NR) in mediating the plant response to ozone (O(3)). Tomato plants were used in a time-course experiment in which they were exposed to acute O(3) fumigation with 200 nl l(-1) O(3) for 4 h. The pattern of leaf lesions indicated similar sensitivities to O(3) for cv. Pearson and Nr. In both genotypes, O(3) activated a hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-dependent oxidative burst, which was also ethylene-driven in Nr leaves. Ozone induced some ethylene and jasmonate biosynthetic and inducible genes, although with different timings and to different extents in the two genotypes. The overall data indicate that Nr retains partial sensitivity to ethylene, suggesting only a marginal role of the NR receptor in mediating the complex response of tomato plants to O(3).

Ozone: !induces! ethylene biosynthetic and inducible genes
Ozone: !activates! hydrogen peroxide-dependent oxidative burst
