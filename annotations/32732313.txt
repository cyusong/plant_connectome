Light and the circadian clock are two essential external and internal cues affecting seedling development. COLD-REGULATED GENE27 (COR27), which is regulated by cold temperatures and light signals, functions as a key regulator of the circadian clock. Here, we report that COR27 acts as a negative regulator of light signaling. COR27 physically interacts with the CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1)-SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A1 (SPA1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and undergoes COP1-mediated degradation via the 26S proteasome system in the dark. <i>cor27</i> mutant seedlings exhibit shorter hypocotyls, while transgenic lines overexpressing <i>COR27</i> show elongated hypocotyls in the light. In addition, light induces the accumulation of COR27. On one hand, accumulated COR27 interacts with ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) to repress HY5 DNA binding activity. On the other hand, COR27 associates with the chromatin at the <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i> (<i>PIF4</i>) promoter region and upregulates <i>PIF4</i> expression in a circadian clock-dependent manner. Together, our findings reveal a mechanistic framework whereby COR27 represses photomorphogenesis in the light and provide insights toward how light and the circadian clock synergistically control hypocotyl growth.
