<i>A reevaluation of flux data for Arabidopsis mutants reveals that nitrate uptake through AtNRT1.1 conforms to a single low-affinity transport system that makes virtually no contribution to high-affinity nitrate uptake</i>.

AtNRT1.1: !conforms to! single low-affinity transport system 
AtNRT1.1: !makes virtually no contribution to! high-affinity nitrate uptake
