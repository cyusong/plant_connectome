<i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that causes disease in diverse plant species. In recent years, the genomic and transcriptomic studies have identified several candidate pathogenicity determinants of <i>R. solani</i>; however, most of them remain to be validated. In this study, we report a viral vector-based host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) as well as a dsRNA (double-stranded RNA)-based approach to effectively downregulate genes of <i>R. solani</i> AG1-IA (BRS1 strain) during pathogenesis in tomato. We tested a few of the in-planta upregulated <i>R. solani</i> genes and observed that silencing of one of them, i.e., <i>RS_CRZ1</i> (a C2H2 type zinc finger transcription factor) significantly compromises the pathogenesis of <i>R. solani</i> in tomato. The <i>RS_CRZ1</i>-silenced plants not only exhibited significant reduction in disease symptoms, but the depth of pathogen colonization was also compromised. Furthermore, we identified the <i>R. solani</i> genes that were coregulated with <i>RS_CRZ1</i> during the pathogenicity process. The HIGS-mediated silencing of a few of them [CL1756Contig1; subtilisin-like protease and CL1817Contig2; 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase] compromised the pathogenesis of <i>R. solani</i> in tomato. The ectopic expression of <i>RS_CRZ1</i> complemented the <i>crz1</i> mutant of yeast and restored tolerance against various metal ion stress. Overall, our study reveals the importance of <i>RS_CRZ1</i> in managing the hostile environment encountered during host colonization. Also, it emphasizes the relevance of the HIGS and dsRNA-based gene silencing approach toward functional characterization of pathogenicity determinants of <i>R. solani</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
