New Guinea is the world's largest tropical island and has fascinated naturalists for centuries<sup>1,2</sup>. Home to some of the best-preserved ecosystems on the planet<sup>3</sup> and to intact ecological gradients-from mangroves to tropical alpine grasslands-that are unmatched in the Asia-Pacific region<sup>4,5</sup>, it is a globally recognized centre of biological and cultural diversity<sup>6,7</sup>. So far, however, there has been no attempt to critically catalogue the entire vascular plant diversity of New Guinea. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, expert-verified checklist of the vascular plants of mainland New Guinea and surrounding islands. Our publicly available checklist includes 13,634 species (68% endemic), 1,742 genera and 264 families-suggesting that New Guinea is the most floristically diverse island in the world. Expert knowledge is essential for building checklists in the digital era: reliance on online taxonomic resources alone would have inflated species counts by 22%. Species discovery shows no sign of levelling off, and we discuss steps to accelerate botanical research in the 'Last Unknown'<sup>8</sup>.
