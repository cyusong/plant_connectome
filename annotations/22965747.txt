['22965747', 'The transcription factor ATAF2, one of the plant specific NAC family genes, is  known as repressor of pathogenesis-related genes and responsive to the diverse  defense-related hormones, pathogen infection, and wounding stress. Furthermore,  it is important to consider that tryptophan-dependant IAA biosynthesis pathway  can be activated by wounding and pathogen. We found that ATAF2pro::GUS reporter  was induced upon indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) treatments. And ataf2 mutant showed  reduced sensitivity to IAN whereas 35S::ATAF2 plants showed hyper-sensitivity to  IAN. IAN biosynthesis required nitrilase involved in the conversion of IAN to an  auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). We found that the NIT2 gene was repressed in  ataf2 knockout plants. Expression of both ATAF2 and NIT2 genes was induced by IAN  treatment. Transgenic plants overexpressing ATAF2 showed up-regulated NIT2  expression. ATAF2 activated promoter of the NIT2 gene in Arabidopsis protoplasts.  Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that NIT2 promoter region from  position -117 to -82 contains an ATAF2 binding site where an imperfect palindrome  sequence was critical to the protein-DNA interaction. These findings indicate  that ATAF2 regulates NIT2 gene expression via NIT2 promoter binding.', '2012 Sep', 'Mol Cells', '10.1007/s10059-012-0122-2', 'Paek']
