We compare the biomass partitioning patterns and the nitrogen/phosphorus (N,P) stoichiometry of the current-year shoots of tree and herbaceous species and ask whether they scale in the same ways. Our analyses indicate that few statistically significant differences exist between the shoot biomass partitioning patterns of the two functional species-groups. In contrast, statistically significant N,P - stoichiometric differences exist between the two functional groups. Across all species, dry leaf mass scales nearly as the square of basal stem diameter and isometrically with respect to dry stem mass. However, total leaf N scales as the 1.37-power and as the 1.09-power of total leaf P across herbaceous and tree shoots, respectively. Therefore, tree shoots can be viewed as populations of herbs elevated by their older, woody herbaceous cohorts. However, tree leaf stoichiometry cannot be modelled in terms of herbaceous N,P - leaf stoichiometry.
