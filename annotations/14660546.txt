['14660546', 'To gain insight into the processes controlling leaf development, we characterized  an Arabidopsis mutant, varicose (vcs), with leaf and shoot apical meristem  defects. The vcs phenotype is temperature dependent; low temperature growth  largely suppressed defects, whereas high growth temperatures resulted in severe  leaf and meristem defects. VCS encodes a putative WD-domain containing protein,  suggesting a function involving protein-protein interactions. Temperature shift  experiments indicated that VCS is required throughout leaf development, but  normal secondary vein patterning required low temperature early in leaf  development. The low-temperature vcs phenotype is enhanced in axr1-3 vcs double  mutants and in vcs mutants grown in the presence of polar auxin transport  inhibitors, however, vcs has apparently normal auxin responses. Taken together,  these observations suggest a role for VCS in leaf blade formation.', '2003 Dec', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.00909', 'Sieburth']
