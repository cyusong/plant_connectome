Due to their sessile nature, plants must respond to various environmental assaults in a coordinated manner. The endoplasmic reticulum is a central hub for plant responses to various stresses. We previously showed that Phytophthora utilizes effector PsAvh262-mediated binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) accumulation for suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress-triggered cell death. As a BiP binding partner, Bcl-2-associated athanogene 7 (BAG7) plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the unfolded protein response, but little is known about its role in plant immunity. In this work, we reveal a double-faced role of BAG7 in Arabidopsis-Phytophthora interaction in which it regulates endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated immunity oppositely in different cellular compartments. In detail, it acts as a susceptibility factor in the endoplasmic reticulum, but plays a resistance role in the nucleus against Phytophthora. Phytophthora infection triggers the endoplasmic reticulum-to-nucleus translocation of BAG7, the same as abiotic heat stress; however, this process can be prevented by PsAvh262-mediated BiP accumulation. Moreover, the immunoglobulin/albumin-binding domain in PsAvh262 is essential for both pathogen virulence and BiP accumulation. Taken together, our study uncovers a double-faced role of BAG7; Phytophthora advances its colonization in planta by utilizing an effector to detain BAG7 in the endoplasmic reticulum.
