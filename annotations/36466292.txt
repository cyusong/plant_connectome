Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (PEBP) family plays important roles in regulating plant flowering time and morphogenesis. However, geneme-wide identification and functional analysis of <i>PEBP</i> genes in the rigorous short-day plant <i>Perilla frutescens</i> (<i>PfPEBP</i>) have not been studied. In this study, 10 PfPEBP were identified and divided into three subfamilies based on their phylogenetic relationships: FT-like, TFL1-like and MFT-like. Gene structure analysis showed that all <i>PfPEBP</i> genes contain 4 exons and 3 introns. Motifs DPDxP and GIHR essential for anion-binding activity are highly conserved in PfPEBP. A large number of light-responsive elements were detected in promoter regions of <i>PfPEBP</i>. Gene expression of <i>PfFT1</i> exhibited a diurnal rhythm. It was highly expressed in leaves under the short-day photoperiod, but higher in flowers and seeds under the long-day photoperiod. Overexpression of <i>PfFT1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> not only promoted early flowering of Col-0 or Ler, but also rescued the late flowering phenotype of <i>ft-1</i> mutant. We concluded that <i>PfFT1</i> promotes early flowering by regulating the expression of flowering-related genes <i>AtAP1</i>, <i>AtLFY</i>, <i>AtFUL</i> and <i>AtSOC1</i>. In conclusion, our results provided valuable information for elucidating the functions of <i>PfPEBP</i> in <i>P</i>. <i>frutescens</i> and shed light on the promoting effect of <i>PfFT1</i> on flowering.
