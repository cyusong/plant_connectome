['32453812', 'Plants can be simultaneously exposed to multiple stresses. The interplay of  abiotic and biotic stresses may result in synergistic or antagonistic effects on  plant development and health. Temporary drought stress can stimulate plant  immunity; however, the molecular mechanism of drought-induced immunity is largely  unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that cysteine protease RD21A is required  for drought-induced immunity. Temporarily drought-treated wild-type Arabidopsis  plants became more sensitive to the bacterial pathogen-associated molecular  pattern flg22, triggering stomatal closure, which resulted in increased  resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst-DC3000). Knocking out  rd21a inhibited flg22-triggered stomatal closure and compromised the  drought-induced immunity. Ubiquitin E3 ligase SINAT4 interacted with RD21A and  promoted its degradation in vivo. The overexpression of SINAT4 also consistently  compromised the drought-induced immunity to Pst-DC3000. A bacterial type III  effector, AvrRxo1, interacted with both SINAT4 and RD21A, enhancing SINAT4  activity and promoting the degradation of RD21A in vivo. Therefore, RD21A could  be a positive regulator of drought-induced immunity, which could be targeted by  pathogen virulence effectors during pathogenesis.', '2020 Sep 19', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eraa255', 'Zhao']
