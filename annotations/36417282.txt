The fast growth of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) shoots is caused by the rapid elongation of each internode. However, the key underlying cellular processes and epigenetic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. We used microscopy and multi-omics approaches to investigate two regions (bottom and middle) of the 18th internode from shoots of two different heights (2 and 4 m). We observed that internode cells become longer, and that lignin biosynthesis and glycosyltransferase family 43 (GT43) genes are substantially upregulated with shoot height. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) revealed a higher N6-methyladenine (m6A) modification rate in 2-m shoots than in 4-m shoots. In addition, different specific m6A modification sites were enriched at different growth stages. Global DNA methylation profiling indicated that DNA methylation levels are higher in 4-m shoots than in 2-m shoots. We also detected shorter poly(A) tail lengths (PALs) in 4-m shoots compared with 2-m shoots. Genes showing differential PAL were mainly enriched in the functional terms of protein translation and vesicle fusion. An association analysis between PALs and DNA methylation strongly suggested that gene body CG methylation levels are positively associated with PAL. This study provides valuable information to better understand post-transcriptional regulations responsible for fast-growing shoots in Moso bamboo.
