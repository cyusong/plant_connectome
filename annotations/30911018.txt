['30911018', 'Male sterility in plants is caused by various stimuli such as hormone changes,  stress, cytoplasmic alterations and nuclear gene mutations. The gene ANTHER  DEHISCENCE REPRESSOR (ADR), which is involved in regulating male sterility in  Arabidopsis, was functionally analyzed in this study. In ADR::GUS flowers, strong  GUS activity was detected in the anthers of young flower buds but was low in  mature flowers. ADR + GFP fusion proteins, which can be modified by  N-myristoylation, were targeted to peroxisomes. Ectopic expression of ADR in  transgenic Arabidopsis plants resulted in male sterility due to anther  indehiscence. The defect in anther dehiscence in 35S::ADR flowers is due to the  reduction of ROS accumulation, alteration of the secondary thickening in the  anther endothecium and suppression of the expression of NST1 and NST2, which are  required for anther dehiscence through regulation of secondary wall thickening in  anther endothecial cells. This defect could be rescued by external application of  hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). These results demonstrated that ADR must be  N-myristoylated and targeted to the peroxisome during the early stages of flower  development to negatively regulate anther dehiscence by suppressing ROS  accumulation and NST1/NST2 expression.', '2019 Mar 25', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/s41598-019-41382-z', 'Yang']
