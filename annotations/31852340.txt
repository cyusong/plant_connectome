We recently reported the transcriptomic signature of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthetic and responsive genes in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants infested with the herbivore <i>Eurydema oleracea</i>. We demonstrated that insect feeding causes induction of both SA- and JA-mediated signaling pathways. Using transgenic SA-deficient <i>NahG</i> plants, we also showed antagonistic cross-talk between these two phytohormones. To gain more insight into the roles of the SA and JA pathways in plant defenses against <i>E. oleracea</i>, we report here on the dynamics of SA and JA levels in the wild-type genotype Col-0 and the transgenic <i>Arabidopsis NahG</i> mutant that does not accumulate SA. We show that SA strongly accumulates in the wild-type plants after 24 h of herbivore infestation, while JA levels do not change significantly. On the contrary, in the infested <i>NahG</i> plants, SA levels were not affected by <i>E. oleracea</i> feeding, whereas JA levels which were constitutively higher than the wild-type did not significantly change after 6 hours of herbivore feeding. Accordingly, when the wild-type and the <i>jar1-1</i> mutant (which fails to accumulate JA-Ile) <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants were challenged with <i>E. oleracea</i> in a two-choice arena, the insect fed preferentially on the <i>jar1-1</i> plants over the wild-type. These data support the conclusion that <i>E. oleracea</i> infestation strongly induces the SA pathway in the wild-type, thus antagonizing JA-mediated plant defenses against herbivory, as a strategy to suppress plant immunity.
