This study aims to analyze the importance of leaf size on plant growth capacity among an array of closely related Limonium species, and its impact on the underlying determinants of growth reduction under extreme water deficit conditions. To do so, thirteen Balearic Limonium species with contrasting leaf size were grown under long-term well-watered (WW) and severe water-deficit (WD) conditions in a common garden experiment. Fundamental growth traits were measured, including relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area ratio (LAR), leaf mass area (LMA) and leaf mass ratio (LMR). WD promoted small changes in leaf size, and species with larger leaves had higher RGR than species with smaller leaves, irrespective of the water treatment. Most RGR variation across species and treatments was explained by NAR, with comparatively much lower importance of LAR. The factorization of LAR underlying components denoted the importance of LMA in explaining RGR, whereas the impact of LMR on RGR was negligible in Limonium. Further, species with larger leaves had higher water consumption but also higher water use efficiency, especially under WD. Therefore, contrary to general trends in species from dry environments, increased leaf size is linked to increased growth capacity and also increased water use efficiency across closely related Limonium species.
