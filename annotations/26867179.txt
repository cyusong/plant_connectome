['26867179', 'In animals, Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins are  molecular adaptors that regulate innate and adaptive immunity, development, and  abiotic stress responses. Although gene families encoding TRAF domain-containing  proteins exhibit enriched diversity in higher plants, their biological roles are  poorly defined. Here, we report the identification of two redundant TRAF  proteins, Mutant, snc1-enhancing 13 (MUSE13) and MUSE14, that contribute to the  turnover of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR)  immune receptors SNC1 and RPS2. Loss of both MUSE13 and MUSE14 leads to enhanced  pathogen resistance, NLR accumulation, and autoimmunity, while MUSE13  overexpression results in reduced NLR levels and activity. In planta, MUSE13  associates with SNC1, RPS2, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(CPR1). Taken  together, we speculate that MUSE13 and MUSE14 associate with the SCF E3 ligase  complex to form a plant-type TRAFasome, which modulates ubiquitination and  subsequent degradation of NLR immune sensors to maintain their homeostasis.', '2016 Feb 10', 'Cell Host Microbe', '10.1016/j.chom.2016.01.005', 'Li']
