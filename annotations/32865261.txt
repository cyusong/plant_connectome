The human retinoblastoma (RB1) protein is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates cell cycle progression through its interaction with members of the E2F/DP family of transcription factors. However, RB-related (RBR) proteins are an early acquisition during eukaryote evolution present in plant lineages, including unicellular algae, ancient plants (ferns, lycophytes, liverworts, mosses), gymnosperms, and angiosperms. The main RBR protein domains and interactions with E2Fs are conserved in all eukaryotes and not only regulate the G1/S transition but also the G2/M transition, as part of DREAM complexes. RBR proteins are also important for asymmetric cell division, stem cell maintenance, and the DNA damage response (DDR). RBR proteins play crucial roles at every developmental phase transition, in association with chromatin factors, as well as during the reproductive phase during female and male gametes production and embryo development. Here, we review the processes where plant RBR proteins play a role and discuss possible avenues of research to obtain a full picture of the multifunctional roles of RBR for plant life.
