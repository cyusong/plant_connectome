['10631247', 'In an attempt to elucidate the biological function of villin-like actin-binding  proteins in plants we have cloned several genes encoding Arabidopsis proteins  with high homology to animal villin. We found that Arabidopsis contains at least  four villin-like genes (AtVLNs) encoding four different VLN isoforms. Two AtVLN  isoforms are more closely related to mammalian villin in their primary structure  and are also antigenically related, whereas the other two contain significant  changes in the C-terminal headpiece domain. RNA and promoter/beta-glucuronidase  expression studies demonstrated that AtVLN genes are expressed in all organs,  with elevated expression levels in certain types of cells. These results suggest  that AtVLNs have less-specialized functions than mammalian villin, which is found  only in the microvilli of brush border cells. Immunoblot experiments using a  monoclonal antibody against pig villin showed that AtVLNs are widely distributed  in a variety of plant tissues. Green fluorescent protein fused to full-length  AtVLN and individual AtVLN headpiece domains can bind to both animal and plant  actin filaments in vivo.', '2000 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.122.1.35', 'Chua']
