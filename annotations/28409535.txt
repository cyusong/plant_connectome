The small ubiqutin-like modifier E3 ligase SIZ1 regulates multiple processes in Arabidopsis, including salicylic-acid-dependent immune responses. However, the targets of SIZ1 in plant immunity are not known. Here, we provide evidence that the plant immune receptor nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat gene SNC1 partially mediates the regulation of plant immunity by SIZ1. The siz1 loss-of-function mutant has an autoimmune phenotype that is dependent on SNC1 and temperature. Overexpression of SIZ1 partially rescues autoimmune mutant phenotypes induced by activation or overaccumulation of SNC1, and the SNC1 protein amount is attenuated by SIZ1 overexpression. In addition, overexpression of the F-box protein CPR1 that degrades the SNC1 protein inhibits the growth defects and disease resistance of the siz1 mutant. Furthermore, we found that the SNC1 protein is sumoylated in planta. Although it remains to be determined whether SIZ1 primarily modulates the SNC1 protein via sumoylation or affects SNC1 transcript level, our data indicate that SNC1 is a major mediator of defense response modulated by SIZ1 and that SNC1 is a crucial target for fine-tuning plant defense responses.
