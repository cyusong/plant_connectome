Small RNAs are riboregulators that have critical roles in most eukaryotes. They repress gene expression by acting either on DNA to guide sequence elimination and chromatin remodeling, or on RNA to guide cleavage and translation repression. This review focuses on the various types of post-transcriptional small RNA-directed pathways in plants, describing their roles and their regulations.

Small RNAs: !repress! gene expression
DNA: !guided by! small RNAs
RNA: !guided by! small RNAs
Plants: !contain! post-transcriptional small RNA-directed pathways
