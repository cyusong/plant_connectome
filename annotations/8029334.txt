['8029334', 'Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA transformants were screened for mutations affecting  seed fatty acid composition. A mutant line was found with reduced levels of  linolenic acid (18:3) due to a T-DNA insertion. Genomic DNA flanking the T-DNA  insertion was used to obtain an Arabidopsis cDNA that encodes a polypeptide  identified as a microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturase by its complementation  of the mutation. Analysis of lipid content in transgenic tissues demonstrated  that this enzyme is limiting for 18:3 production in Arabidopsis seeds and carrot  hairy roots. This cDNA was used to isolate a related Arabidopsis cDNA, whose mRNA  is accumulated to a much higher level in leaf tissue relative to root tissue.  This related cDNA encodes a protein that is a homolog of the microsomal  desaturase but has an N-terminal extension deduced to be a transit peptide, and  its gene maps to a position consistent with that of the Arabidopsis fad D locus,  which controls plastid omega-3 desaturation. These Arabidopsis cDNAs were used as  hybridization probes to isolate cDNAs encoding homologous proteins from  developing seeds of soybean and rapeseed. The high degree of sequence similarity  between these sequences suggests that the omega-3 desaturases use a common enzyme  mechanism.', '1993 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.2.467', 'et']
