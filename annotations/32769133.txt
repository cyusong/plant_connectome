Flowering plants and mammals contain imprinted genes that are primarily expressed in the endosperm and placenta in a parent-of-origin manner. In this study, we show that early activation of the geminivirus genes <i>C2</i> and <i>C3</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants, encoding a viral suppressor of RNA interference and a replication enhancer protein, respectively, is correlated with the transient vegetative expression of <i>VARIANT IN METHYLATION5</i> (<i>VIM5</i>), an endosperm imprinted gene that is conserved in diverse plant species. VIM5 is a ubiquitin E3 ligase that directly targets the DNA methyltransferases MET1 and CMT3 for degradation by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome proteolytic pathway. Infection with <i>Beet severe curly top virus</i> induced <i>VIM5</i> expression in rosette leaf tissues, possibly via the expression of the viral replication initiator protein, leading to the early activation of <i>C2</i> and <i>C3</i> coupled with reduced symmetric methylation in the <i>C2-3</i> promoter and the onset of disease symptoms. These findings demonstrate how this small DNA virus recruits a host imprinted gene for the epigenetic activation of viral gene transcription. Our findings reveal a distinct strategy used by plant pathogens to exploit the host machinery in order to inhibit methylation-mediated defense responses when establishing infection.
