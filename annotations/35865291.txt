Plants adjust root morphological and/or exudation traits in response to phosphorus (P) mobilization mediated by microorganisms. We hypothesized that straw application coupled with P fertilization would influence microbial P and then root nutrient-acquisition strategies related to crop growth. Root morphological (length and average diameter) and exudation traits (acid phosphatase and carboxylates) of <i>Brassica chinensis</i>, <i>Solanum lycopersicum, Lactuca sativa</i>, and <i>Vigna unguiculata</i> in response to microbial P dynamics were characterized in no-P and P-fertilized soil with/without straw addition. Straw addition increased the growth of fungi and bacteria, stimulating microbial P immobilization at day 24. The high microbial abundance was associated with four tested crops having short roots in straw-amended compared with no-straw soil at day 24. In straw-amended soil, <i>B. chinensis</i> and <i>S. lycopersicum</i> shifted toward root P-acquisition strategies based on fast elongation and strong carboxylate exudation from days 24 to 40. Such effective root P-acquisition strategies together with microbial P release increased shoot P content in <i>S. lycopersicum</i> in straw-amended compared with those without straw at day 40. Conversely, <i>L. sativa</i> and <i>V. unguiculata</i> produced short roots in response to the stable (or even increased) microbial P after straw addition till day 40. In straw-amended soil, high P application stimulated root elongation and carboxylate exudation in <i>L. sativa</i> and <i>V. unguiculata</i>, whereas carboxylate exudation by <i>S. lycopersicum</i> was decreased compared with the straw-amended but non-fertilized treatment at day 40. In summary, root P-acquisition strategies in response to microbial P differed among the tested crop species. Phosphorus fertilization needs to be highlighted when returning straw to enhance P-use efficiency in vegetable cropping systems.
