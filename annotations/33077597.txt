Abscisic acid (ABA) is the key phytohormone in plant drought tolerance and stress adaptation. The clade A protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2Cs) like ABI1 (ABA-INSENSITIVE 1) work as coreceptors of ABA and regulate multiple ABA responses. Ubiquitination of ABI1 has been proven to play important regulatory roles in ABA signaling. However, the specific ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) involved is unknown. Here, we report that UBC27 is an active E2 that positively regulates ABA signaling and drought tolerance. UBC27 forms the E2-E3 pair with the drought regulator RING E3 ligase AIRP3. Both UBC27 and AIRP3 interact with ABI1 and affect the ubiquitination and degradation of ABI1. ABA activates the expression of <i>UBC27</i>, inhibits the proteasome degradation of UBC27, and enhances the interaction between UBC27 and ABI1 to increase its activity. These findings uncover a regulatory mechanism in ABA signaling and drought response and provide a further understanding of the plant ubiquitination system and ABA signaling pathway.
