['9611168', 'Arabidopsis contains five isoenzymes of aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT)  localized to the cytosol, chloroplast, mitochondria, or peroxisomes. To define  the in vivo function of individual isoenzymes, we screened for Arabidopsis  mutants deficient in either of the two major isoenzymes, cytosolic AAT2 or  chloroplastic AAT3, using a native gel activity assay. In a screen of 8,000 M2  seedlings, three independent mutants deficient in cytosolic AAT2 (aat2) and two  independent mutants deficient in chloroplastic AAT3 (aat3) were isolated. Mapping  of aat2 and aat3 mutations and the five AspAT genes (ASP1-ASP5) established  associations as follows: the mutation affecting aat2 maps with and cosegregates  with ASP2, one of two expressed genes for cytosolic AspAT; the mutation affecting  aat3 maps to the same location as the ASP5 gene encoding chloroplastic AspAT.  Phenotypic analysis of the aat2 and aat3 mutants revealed a dramatic  aspartate-related phenotype in one of the mutants deficient in cytosolic AAT2.  The aat2-2 mutant displays an 80% reduction in levels of aspartate transported in  the phloem of light-grown plants, and a 50% reduction in levels of asparagine  transported in dark-adapted plants. These results indicate that cytosolic AAT2 is  the major isoenzyme controlling aspartate synthesized for nitrogen transport in  the light, and that this aspartate pool is converted to asparagine when plants  are dark adapted.', '1998 Jun', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/149.2.491', 'Coruzzi']
