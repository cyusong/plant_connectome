In many plant species, the intact main shoot apex grows predominantly and axillary bud outgrowth is inhibited. This phenomenon is called apical dominance, and has been analyzed for over 70 years. Decapitation of the shoot apex releases the axillary buds from their dormancy and they begin to grow out. Auxin derived from an intact shoot apex suppresses axillary bud outgrowth, whereas cytokinin induced by decapitation of the shoot apex stimulates axillary bud outgrowth. Here we describe the molecular mechanisms of the interactions between auxin and cytokinin in the control of shoot branching.

Auxin: !suppresses! Axillary bud outgrowth
Cytokinin: !stimulates! Axillary bud outgrowth
Decapitation: !releases! Axillary buds from dormancy
