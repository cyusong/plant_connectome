Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are one class of small non-coding RNAs that have important regulatory roles in higher plants. Much less is known about their prevalence and function in lower land plants. Previously we cloned 100 non-structural small RNAs from the moss Physcomitrella patens but could annotate only 11 as miRNAs. To identify additional moss miRNAs among cloned small RNAs we have analyzed their genomic sequences for a characteristic miRNA precursor-like structure. This analysis revealed 19 new moss miRNAs that are predicted to be encoded by 22 putative foldbacks. Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of 14 new miRNA representatives. Half of these were gametophore specific, the rest were detected at low levels in the protonema. We predicted 12 genes as targets of nine new miRNAs. Three of these show homology to transcription factors and the others appear to play roles in diverse physiological processes including light and cytokine signaling, which have not to date been shown to be regulated by a miRNA in flowering plants. Four target genes, which show homology to ATN1-like protein kinase, NAC transcription factors and a cytokinin receptor, have been validated by miRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage. In addition, our analysis revealed that seven small RNAs represent miRNA* and three represent intermediates of pre-miRNA processing, providing evidence for specific DICER-like cleavage steps during miRNA biogenesis in moss. Our findings suggest that miRNAs are common in mosses and set the stage for the elucidation of their varied biological functions.
