Retrograde signals from the chloroplast control expression of nuclear genes. A large fraction of these genes is affected rapidly upon light intensity shifts. This study was designed to address the interdependence of signaling pathways involved in the rapid high light response and redox and reactive oxygen species signaling by exploiting the glutathione and ascorbate deficient mutants pad2 and vtc1. In the first set of experiments the transcriptional response of the two transcription factors ERF6 and ERF105 that had previously been shown to rapidly respond to light was shown to be deregulated in the pad2 mutant but not in the vtc1 background. The transcriptional response after combining the low-to-high light transfer with methylviologen pretreatment further demonstrated the significance of glutathione in strongly modulating the retrograde response. Transcripts encoding small heat shock proteins (HSP17.4, HSP176a, HSP20-like1 and HSP20-like2) and the lipid transfer protein LTP3 were taken as markers responding to the combinatorial treatment in wild type, and most strongly in pad2 in high light or upon methylviologen treatment. A correlation with H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> accumulation was not observed. It is concluded that glutathione-dependent processes participate in light-triggered rapid gene regulation independent on cellular H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> .
