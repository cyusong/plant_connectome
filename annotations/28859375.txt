In Fabaceae, dispersion of forisomes-highly ordered aggregates of sieve element proteins-in response to phytoplasma infection was proposed to limit phloem mass flow and, hence, prevent pathogen spread. In this study, the involvement of filamentous sieve element proteins in the containment of phytoplasmas was investigated in non-Fabaceae plants. Healthy and infected Arabidopsis plants lacking one or two genes related to sieve element filament formation-AtSEOR1 (At3g01680), AtSEOR2 (At3g01670), and AtPP2-A1 (At4g19840)-were analysed. TEM images revealed that phytoplasma infection induces phloem protein filament formation in both the wild-type and mutant lines. This result suggests that, in contrast to previous hypotheses, sieve element filaments can be produced independently of AtSEOR1 and AtSEOR2 genes. Filament presence was accompanied by a compensatory overexpression of sieve element protein genes in infected mutant lines in comparison with wild-type lines. No correlation was found between phloem mass flow limitation and phytoplasma titre, which suggests that sieve element proteins are involved in defence mechanisms other than mechanical limitation of the pathogen.
