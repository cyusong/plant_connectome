Nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins are critical for disease resistance in plants, while we do not know whether S-acylation of these proteins plays a role during bacterial infection. We identified 30 Arabidopsis mutants with mutations in NB-LRR encoding genes from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center and characterized their contribution to the plant immune response after inoculation with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000). Of the five mutants that were hyper-susceptible to the pathogen, three (R5L1, R5L2 and RPS5) proteins contain the conserved S-acylation site in the N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain. In wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis plants, R5L1 was transcriptionally activated upon pathogen infection, and R5L1 overexpression lines had enhanced resistance. Independent experiments indicated that R5L1 localized at the plasma membrane (PM) via S-acylation of its N-terminal CC domain, which was mediated by PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE 13/16 (PAT13, PAT16). Modification of the S-acylation site reduced its affinity for binding the PM, with a consequent significant reduction in bacterial resistance. PM localization of R5L1 was significantly reduced in pat13 and pat16 mutants, similar to what was found for WT plants treated with 2-bromopalmitate, an S-acylation-blocking agent. Transgenic plants expressing R5L1 in the pat13 pat16 double mutant showed no enhanced disease resistance. Overexpression of R5L1 in WT Arabidopsis resulted in substantial accumulation of reactive oxygen species after inoculation with Pst DC3000; this effect was not observed with a mutant R5L1 carrying a mutated S-acylation site. Our data suggest that PAT13- and PAT16-mediated S-acylation of R5L1 is crucial for its membrane localization to activate the plant defense response.
