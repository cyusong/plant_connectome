Dioecy system is an important strategy for maintaining genetic diversity. The transcription factor <i>MeGI</i>, contributes to dioecy by promoting gynoecium development in <i>Diospyros lotus</i> and <i>D. kaki</i>. However, the function of <i>MeGI</i> in <i>D. oleifera</i> has not been identified. In this study, we confirmed that <i>MeGI</i>, cloned from <i>D. oleifera</i>, repressed the androecium development in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Subsequently, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq), DNA affinity purification-sequencing (DAP-seq), and RNA-seq were used to uncover the gene expression response to <i>MeGI</i>. The results showed that the genes upregulated and downregulated in response to <i>MeGI</i> were mainly enriched in the circadian rhythm-related and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways, respectively. Additionally, the WRKY DNA-binding protein 28 (<i>WRKY28</i>) gene, which was detected by ChIP-seq, DAP-seq, and RNA-seq, was emphasized. <i>WRKY28</i> has been reported to inhibit salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis and was upregulated in MeGI-overexpressing <i>A. thaliana</i> flowers, suggesting that <i>MeGI</i> represses the SA level by increasing the expression level of <i>WRKY28</i>. This was confirmed that SA level was lower in <i>D. oleifera</i> female floral buds than male. Overall, our findings indicate that the <i>MeGI</i> mediates its sex control function in <i>D. oleifera</i> mainly by regulating genes in the circadian rhythm, SA biosynthetic, and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways.
