There is no question that protein- and RNA-based measurements are complementary, but which approach has the highest return in the case of a non-model crop and what is the correlation between mRNA and proteins? We describe and evaluate in detail the advantages and pitfalls of both a proteomics and a transcriptomics approach. The information on the abundance of transcripts was obtained by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), while information on the abundance of proteins was obtained via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Gene: !affects! Process 
Proteomics: !complements! Transcriptomics 
SAGE: !obtains! Transcript Abundance 
2D Gel Electrophoresis: !obtains! Protein Abundance
