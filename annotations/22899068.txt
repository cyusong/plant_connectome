Endoreduplication is a cell cycle variant in which multiple rounds of DNA replication occur without subsequent mitosis, resulting in polyploid cells. Although cells with endoreduplicated nuclei were ubiquitously distributed throughout the abscission zone (AZ) of tomato leaf before abscission induction by ethylene, endoreduplication was detected mostly on the proximal side of the AZ after induction. The possible association between endoreduplication and intensive membrane trafficking in cells at the proximal side of the AZ is discussed.

Endoreduplication: !occurs in! Polyploid cells
