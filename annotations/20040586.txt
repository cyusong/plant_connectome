To express a foreign gene in plants effectively, a good expression system is required. Here we describe the identification of a transcriptional terminator that supports increased levels of expression. The terminators of several Arabidopsis genes were examined in transfected Arabidopsis T87 protoplasts. The heat shock protein 18.2 (HSP) terminator was the most effective in supporting increased levels of expression. The HSP terminator increases mRNA levels of both transiently and stably expressed transgenes approximately 2-fold more than the NOS (nopaline synthase) terminator. When combined with the HSP terminator, a translational enhancer increased gene expression levels approximately 60- to 100-fold in transgenic plants.
