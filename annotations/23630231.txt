How does auxin provoke such a diverse array of responses? This long-standing question is further complicated by a remarkably short nuclear auxin signalling pathway. To crack the auxin code, several potential sources of specificity need to be evaluated. These include: specificity of interactions among the core auxin response components, specificity resulting from higher order complex dynamics, and specificity in interactions with global factors controlling protein turnover and transcriptional repression. Here, we review recent progress towards characterizing and quantifying these interactions and highlight key gaps that remain.
