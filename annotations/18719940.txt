Responses of plant tissue to environmental challenges can vary among different plant parts and among plants of different ages. Investment into defense has been proposed to be influenced by fitness value and/or allocation of available resources. Here we show at first time at transcriptome level that plant defense is non-linear. On very young, expanding, adult and old leaves of Populus nigra plants exposed to air perturbation, we studied the ontogenic trajectory of gene expression changes to such a low-dose factor similar to wind. Although plant responses to mechanical sensation (wind, touch) are described and summarized as thigmomorphogenesis, the knowledge on the molecular background of plant responses to wind is largely incomplete. Our data describe which genes are activated during a ubiquitous and continuous environmental factor such as wind, and based on existing knowledge complement the picture on ongoing processes.
