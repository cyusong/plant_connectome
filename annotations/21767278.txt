The major known function of glutaredoxins (Grxs) is to reduce disulphide bridges. Recently, some have also been shown to interact with iron-sulphur clusters. These can be classified in two subgroups: class II Grx are found in all living organisms and are implicated in assembly of iron-sulphur clusters, while class I Grx are represented by only two members known to form a holodimer structure containing a cluster in vitro, but with an unknown function different from class II. Here, we report that in eukaryotic plants, GRXC1 (class I) orthologs are exclusively present in dicotyledonous plants, suggesting a specific function. Indeed, in Arabidopsis thaliana, reducing activity of recombinant GRXC1 is regulated by redox-dependent stability of the cluster. In planta, GRXC1 has been found predominantly in a holodimeric form, indicating the presence of the cluster in vivo. This suggests that GRXC1 acts as a redox sensor, reducing downstream pathways under oxidative conditions. GRXC2, the closest homolog of GRXC1, is unable to form a cluster in vitro. Knock-out mutants in grxc1 or grxc2 are aphenotypic, but the double mutant produces a lethal phenotype at an early stage after pollinization, suggesting that GRXC1 and GRXC2 share redundant and vital functions.
