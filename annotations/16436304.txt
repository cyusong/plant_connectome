We isolated and identified four rice genes, OsBIERF1 to OsBIERF4 (Oryza sativa benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced ethylene responsive transcriptional factors (ERF)) and analyzed their expressions in rice disease resistance response and under various abiotic stress conditions. The OsBIERF1-4 proteins contain conserved ERF domains, but are categorized into different classes of the previously characterized ERF proteins based on their structural organizations. OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF2 belong to Classes I and II, respectively; while OsBIRERF1 and OsBIERF4 are members of Class IV. OsBIERF3 could bind specifically to the GCC box sequence and was targeted to nucleus when transiently expressed in onion epidermis cells. Expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was induced by treatments with BTH and salicylic acid, chemical inducers capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice. In the BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings. OsBIERF1 and OsBIERF3 were activated in an incompatible interaction but not in compatible interaction between rice and M. grisea. Moreover, OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 were also up-regulated by salt, cold, drought and wounding. These results suggest that OsBIERF proteins may participate in different signaling pathways that mediate disease resistance response and stress responses to abiotic factors.
