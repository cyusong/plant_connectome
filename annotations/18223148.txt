['18223148', 'Although the nonphotosynthetic NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) was assumed to play a  central role in the metabolite flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the  knowledge on this enzyme is still limited. Here, we report on the identification  and characterization of two genes encoding mitochondrial NAD-MEs from Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana), AtNAD-ME1 and AtNAD-ME2. The encoded proteins can be  grouped into the two clades found in the plant NAD-ME phylogenetic tree.  AtNAD-ME1 belongs to the clade that includes known alpha-subunits with molecular  masses of approximately 65 kD, while AtNAD-ME2 clusters with the known  beta-subunits with molecular masses of approximately 58 kD. The separated  recombinant proteins showed NAD-ME activity, presented comparable kinetic  properties, and are dimers in their active conformation. Native electrophoresis  coupled to denaturing electrophoresis revealed that in vivo AtNAD-ME forms a  dimer of nonidentical subunits in Arabidopsis. Further support for this  conclusion was obtained by reconstitution of the active heterodimer in vitro. The  characterization of loss-of-function mutants for both AtNAD-MEs indicated that  both proteins also exhibit enzymatic activity in vivo. Neither the single nor the  double mutants showed a growth or developmental phenotype, suggesting that NAD-ME  activity is not essential for normal autotrophic development. Nevertheless,  metabolic profiling of plants completely lacking NAD-ME activity revealed  differential patterns of modifications in light and dark periods and indicates a  major role for NAD-MEs during nocturnal metabolism.', '2008 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.107.114975', 'Maurino']
