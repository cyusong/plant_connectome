Plant diseases generally tend to be more serious under conditions of high temperature and high humidity (HTHH) than under ambient temperature, but plant immunity against pathogen attacks under HTHH remains elusive. Herein, we used pepper as an example to study how Solanaceae cope with Ralstonia solanacearum infection (RSI) under HTHH by performing RNA-seq combined with the reverse genetic method. The result showed that immunities mediated by salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) in pepper roots were activated by RSI under ambient temperature. However, upon RSI under HTHH, JA signalling was blocked and SA signalling was activated early but its duration was greatly shortened in pepper roots, instead, expression of CaIPT5 and Glutathione S-transferase encoding genes, as well as endogenous content of trans-Zeatin, were enhanced. In addition, by silencing in pepper plants and overexpression in Nicotiana benthamiana, CaIPT5 was found to act positively in the immune response to RSI under HTHH in a way related to CaPRP1 and CaMgst3. Furthermore, the susceptibility of pepper, tomato and tobacco to RSI under HTHH was significantly reduced by exogenously applied tZ, but not by either SA or MeJA. All these data collectively suggest that pepper employs cytokinin-mediated immunity to cope with RSI under HTHH.
