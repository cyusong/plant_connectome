The cell walls of leaf base tissues of the Canary Island date palm (<i>Phoenix canariensis</i>) contain lignins with the most complex compositions described to date. The lignin composition varies by tissue region and is derived from traditional monolignols (ML) along with an unprecedented range of ML conjugates: ML-acetate, ML-benzoate, ML-<i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoate, ML-vanillate, ML-<i>p</i>-coumarate, and ML-ferulate. The specific functions of such complex lignin compositions are unknown. However, the distribution of the ML conjugates varies depending on the tissue region, indicating that they may play specific roles in the cell walls of these tissues and/or in the plant's defense system.
