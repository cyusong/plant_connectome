['23175743', 'Root hairs provide a model system to study plant cell growth, yet little is known  about the polysaccharide compositions of their walls or the role of these  polysaccharides in wall expansion. We report that Arabidopsis thaliana root hair  walls contain a previously unidentified xyloglucan that is composed of both  neutral and galacturonic acid-containing subunits, the latter containing the  beta-D-galactosyluronic acid-(1-->2)-alpha-D-xylosyl-(1--> and/or  alpha-L-fucosyl-(1-->2)-beta-D-galactosyluronic acid-(1-->2)-alpha-D-xylosyl-(1-->) side chains.  Arabidopsis mutants lacking root hairs have no acidic xyloglucan. A  loss-of-function mutation in At1g63450, a root hair-specific gene encoding a  family GT47 glycosyltransferase, results in the synthesis of xyloglucan that  lacks galacturonic acid. The root hairs of this mutant are shorter than those of  the wild type. This mutant phenotype and the absence of galacturonic acid in the  root xyloglucan are complemented by At1g63450. The leaf and stem cell walls of  wild-type Arabidopsis contain no acidic xyloglucan. However, overexpression of  At1g63450 led to the synthesis of galacturonic acid-containing xyloglucan in  these tissues. We propose that At1g63450 encodes XYLOGLUCAN-SPECIFIC  GALACTURONOSYLTRANSFERASE1, which catalyzes the formation of the galactosyluronic  acid-(1-->2)-alpha-D-xylopyranosyl linkage and that the acidic xyloglucan is present  only in root hair cell walls. The role of the acidic xyloglucan in root hair tip  growth is discussed.', '2012 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.103390', "O'Neill"]
