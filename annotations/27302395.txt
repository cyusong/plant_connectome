The membranes of eukaryotic cells create hydrophobic barriers that control substance and information exchange between the inside and outside of cells and between cellular compartments. Besides their roles as membrane building blocks, some membrane lipids, such as phosphoinositides (PIs), also exert regulatory effects. Indeed, emerging evidence indicates that PIs play crucial roles in controlling polarity and growth in plants. Here, I highlight the key roles of PIs as important regulatory membrane lipids in plant development and function.

PIs: !control! polarity and growth 
PIs: !play crucial roles in! plant development and function 
membranes: !create! hydrophobic barriers 
membranes: !control! substance and information exchange
