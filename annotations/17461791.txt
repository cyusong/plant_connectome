['17461791', 'Glucosinolates are a class of plant secondary metabolites that serve as  antiherbivore compounds in plant defence. A previously identified Arabidopsis  thaliana activation-tagged line, displaying altered levels of secondary  metabolites, was shown here to be affected in the content of indolic and  aliphatic glucosinolates. The observed chemotype was caused by activation of the  R2R3-MYB transcription factor gene HIG1 (HIGH INDOLIC GLUCOSINOLATE 1, also  referred to as MYB51). HIG1/MYB51 was shown to activate promoters of indolic  glucosinolate biosynthetic genes leading to increased accumulation of indolic  glucosinolates. The corresponding loss-of-function mutant hig1-1 contained low  levels of glucosinolates. Overexpression of the related transcription factor  ATR1/MYB34, which had previously been described as a regulator of indolic  glucosinolate and indole-3-acetic acid homeostasis, in the hig1-1 mutant  background led to a partial rescue of the mutant chemotype along with a severe  high-auxin growth phenotype. Overexpression of MYB122, another close homologue of  HIG1/MYB51, did not rescue the hig1-1 chemotype, but caused a high-auxin  phenotype and increased levels of indolic glucosinolates in the wild-type. By  contrast, overexpression of HIG1/MYB51 resulted in the specific accumulation of  indolic glucosinolates without affecting auxin metabolism and plant morphology.  Mechanical stimuli such as touch or wounding transiently induced the expression  of HIG1/MYB51 but not of ATR1/MYB34, and HIG1/MYB51 overexpression reduced insect  herbivory as revealed by dual-choice assays with the generalist lepidopteran  herbivore, Spodoptera exigua. We hypothesize that HIG1/MYB51 is a regulator of  indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis that also controls responses to biotic  challenges.', '2007 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03099.x', 'Flugge']
