['36423220', 'The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) marks key cell cycle proteins  for proteasomal breakdown, thereby ensuring unidirectional progression through  the cell cycle. Its target recognition is temporally regulated by activating  subunits, one of which is called CELL CYCLE SWITCH 52 A2 (CCS52A2). We sought to  expand the knowledge on the APC/C by using the severe growth phenotypes of  CCS52A2-deficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants as a readout in a  suppressor mutagenesis screen, resulting in the identification of the previously  undescribed gene called PIKMIN1 (PKN1). PKN1 deficiency rescues the disorganized  root stem cell phenotype of the ccs52a2-1 mutant, whereas an excess of PKN1  inhibits the growth of ccs52a2-1 plants, indicating the need for control of PKN1  abundance for proper development. Accordingly, the lack of PKN1 in a wild-type  background negatively impacts cell division, while its systemic overexpression  promotes proliferation. PKN1 shows a cell cycle phase-dependent accumulation  pattern, localizing to microtubular structures, including the preprophase band,  the mitotic spindle, and the phragmoplast. PKN1 is conserved throughout the plant  kingdom, with its function in cell division being evolutionarily conserved in the  liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. Our data thus demonstrate that PKN1 represents a  novel, plant-specific protein with a role in cell division that is likely  proteolytically controlled by the CCS52A2-activated APC/C.', '2023 Mar 17', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiac528', 'ORCID:']
