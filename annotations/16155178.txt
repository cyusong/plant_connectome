['16155178', 'Flowering traits in winter annual Arabidopsis thaliana are conferred mainly by  two genes, FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). FLC acts as a flowering  repressor and is regulated by multiple flowering pathways. We isolated an  early-flowering mutant, suppressor of FRIGIDA3 (suf3), which also shows leaf  serration, weak apical dominance, and infrequent conversion of the inflorescence  shoot to a terminal flower. The suf3 mutation caused a decrease in the transcript  level of FLC in both a FRI-containing line and autonomous pathway mutants.  However, suf3 showed only a partial reduction of FLC transcript level, although  it largely suppressed the late-flowering phenotype. In addition, the suf3  mutation caused acceleration of flowering in both 35S-FLC and a flc null mutant,  indicating that SUF3 regulates additional factor(s) for the repression of  flowering. SUF3 is highly expressed in the shoot apex, but the expression is not  regulated by FRI, autonomous pathway genes, or vernalization. SUF3 encodes the  nuclear ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN6 (ARP6), the homolog of which in yeast is a  component of an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling SWR1 complex. Our analyses  showed that SUF3 regulates FLC expression independent of vernalization, FRI, and  an autonomous pathway gene, all of which affect the histone modification of FLC  chromatin. Subcellular localization using a green fluorescent protein fusion  showed that Arabidopsis ARP6 is located at distinct regions of the nuclear  periphery.', '2005 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.035485', 'Lee']
