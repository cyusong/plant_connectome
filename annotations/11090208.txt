['11090208', 'The Arabidopsis EMB30 gene is essential for controlling the polarity of cell  growth and for normal cell adhesion during seedling development. In this article,  we show that emb30 mutations also affect the growth of undifferentiated plant  cells and adult tissues. EMB30 possesses a Sec7 domain and, based on similarities  to other proteins, presumably functions in the secretory pathway. The plant cell  wall depends on the secretory pathway to deliver its complex polysaccharides. We  show that emb30 mutants have a cell wall defect that sometimes allows material to  be deposited into the interstitial space between cells instead of being  restricted to cell corners. In addition, pectin, a complex polysaccharide  important for cell adhesion, appears to be abnormally localized in emb30 plants.  In contrast, localization of epitopes associated with xyloglucan or  arabinogalactan was similar in wild-type and emb30 tissues, and the localization  of a marker molecule to vacuoles appeared normal. Therefore, emb30 mutations do  not cause a general defect in the secretory pathway. Together, these results  suggest that emb30 mutations result in an abnormal cell wall, which in turn may  account for the defects in cell adhesion and polar cell growth control observed  in the mutants.', '2000 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.11.2047', 'Chua']
