The exocyst is an octameric vesicle tethering complex that functions upstream of SNARE mediated exocytotic vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. All proteins in the complex have been conserved during evolution, and genes that encode the exocyst subunits are present in the genomes of all plants investigated to date. Although the plant exocyst has not been studied in great detail, it is likely that the basic function of the exocyst in vesicle tethering is conserved. Nevertheless, genomic and genetic studies suggest that the exocyst complex in plants may have more diversified roles than that in budding yeast. In this review, we compare the knowledge about the exocyst in plant cells to the well-studied exocyst in budding yeast, in order to explore similarities and differences in expression and function between these organisms, both of which have walled cells.
