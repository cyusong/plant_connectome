['17416732', 'SIZ1 is a SUMO E3 ligase that facilitates conjugation of SUMO to protein  substrates. siz1-2 and siz1-3 T-DNA insertion alleles that caused freezing and  chilling sensitivities were complemented genetically by expressing SIZ1,  indicating that the SIZ1 is a controller of low temperature adaptation in plants.  Cold-induced expression of CBF/DREB1, particularly of CBF3/DREB1A, and of the  regulon genes was repressed by siz1. siz1 did not affect expression of ICE1,  which encodes a MYC transcription factor that is a controller of CBF3/DREB1A. A  K393R substitution in ICE1 [ICE1(K393R)] blocked SIZ1-mediated sumoylation in  vitro and in protoplasts identifying the K393 residue as the principal site of  SUMO conjugation. SIZ1-dependent sumoylation of ICE1 in protoplasts was  moderately induced by cold. Sumoylation of recombinant ICE1 reduced  polyubiquitination of the protein in vitro. ICE1(K393R) expression in wild-type  plants repressed cold-induced CBF3/DREB1A expression and increased freezing  sensitivity. Furthermore, expression of ICE1(K393R) induced transcript  accumulation of MYB15, which encodes a MYB transcription factor that is a  negative regulator of CBF/DREB1. SIZ1-dependent sumoylation of ICE1 may activate  and/or stabilize the protein, facilitating expression of CBF3/DREB1A and  repression of MYB15, leading to low temperature tolerance.', '2007 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.048397', 'Hasegawa']
