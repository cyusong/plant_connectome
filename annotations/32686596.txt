Roots grow asymmetrically, sometimes helically, around their growth direction likely to facilitate environmental sensing. We recently demonstrated that nitrate deficiency induces root coiling on horizontal surface through nitrate transporter/sensor NRT1.1 and PIN2- and AUX-mediated polar auxin transport. Here, we show that nitrate deficiency or <i>NRT1.1</i> loss-of-function induces differential distribution of PIN2 between the future concave and concave sides in root epidermal cells. Treatment with pharmacological drugs suggests that enhanced endocytosis at the future convex side leads to reduced plasma membrane (PM) association of PIN2. A reduction of PIN2 at the PM would maintain a low auxin response to further enhance endocytosis at the convex side, leading to root coiling.

NRT1.1: !induces! root coiling
nitrate deficiency: !induces! differential distribution of PIN2
PIN2: !localizes to! root epidermal cells
endocytosis: !enhances! at future convex side
reduced PIN2: !maintains! low auxin response
