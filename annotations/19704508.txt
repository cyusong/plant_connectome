The cellular and molecular adaptations of non-model woody species to environmental changes are still poorly understood. We have cloned and characterised a novel non-symbiotic hemoglobin from oak roots (QpHb1) which exhibits a specific cellular distribution in the root. The QpHb1 gene is strongly expressed in the protoderm and the protoxylem cells in two Quercus species (Q. petraea and Q. robur) with contrasting adaptive potential to drought and flooding. The constitutive expression of QpHb1 in both oak species in specific root tissues combined with the reported presence of nitric oxide in the same tissues and its potential for protein S-nitrosylation could support a role for non-symbiotic hemoglobins in signalling changes in the root environment and/or in controlling some aspects of root development.
