Suberin, a cell specific, wall-associated biopolymer, is formed during normal plant growth and development as well as in response to stress conditions such as wounding. It is characterized by the deposition of both a poly(phenolic) domain (SPPD) in the cell wall and a poly(aliphatic) domain (SPAD) thought to be deposited between the cell wall and plasma membrane. Although the monomeric components that comprise the SPPD and SPAD are well known, the biosynthesis and deposition of suberin is poorly understood. Using wound healing potato tubers as a model system, we have tracked the flux of carbon into the aliphatic monomers of the SPAD in a time course fashion. From these analyses, we demonstrate that newly formed fatty acids undergo one of two main metabolic fates during wound-induced suberization: (1) desaturation followed by oxidation to form the 18:1 omega-hydroxy and dioic acids characteristic of potato suberin, and (2) elongation to very long chain fatty acids (C20 to C28), associated with reduction to 1-alkanols, decarboxylation to n-alkanes and minor amounts of hydroxylation. The partitioning of carbon between these two metabolic fates illustrates metabolic regulation during wound healing, and provides insight into the organization of fatty acid metabolism.
