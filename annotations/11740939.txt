['11740939', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates plant growth and development as  well as stress tolerance. The Arabidopsis sad1 (supersensitive to ABA and  drought) mutation increases plant sensitivity to drought stress and ABA in seed  germination, root growth, and the expression of some stress-responsive genes.  sad1 plants are also defective in the positive feedback regulation of ABA  biosynthesis genes by ABA and are impaired in drought stress induction of ABA  biosynthesis. SAD1 encodes a polypeptide similar to multifunctional Sm-like snRNP  proteins that are required for mRNA splicing, export, and degradation. These  results suggest a critical role for mRNA metabolism in the control of ABA  signaling as well as in the regulation of ABA homeostasis.', '2001 Dec', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/s1534-5807(01)00087-9', 'Zhu']
