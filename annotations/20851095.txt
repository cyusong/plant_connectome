['20851095', 'Aminodeoxychorismate (ADC) synthase in plants is a bifunctional enzyme containing  glutamine amidotransferase (GAT) and ADC synthase (ADCS) domains. The GAT domain  releases NH(3) from glutamine and the ADCS domain uses NH(3) to aminate  chorismate. This enzyme is involved in folate (vitamin B9) biosynthesis. We  produced a stable recombinant GAT-ADCS from Arabidopsis. Its kinetic properties  were characterized, and activities and coupling of the two domains assessed. Both  domains could operate independently, but not at their optimal capacities. When  coupled, the activity of one domain modified the catalytic properties of the  other. The GAT activity increased in the presence of chorismate, an activation  process that probably involved conformational changes. The ADCS catalytic  efficiency was 10(4) fold higher with glutamine than with NH(4)Cl, indicating  that NH(3) released from glutamine and used for ADC synthesis did not equilibrate  with the external medium. We observed that the GAT activity was always higher  than that of ADCS, the excess of NH(3) being released in the external medium. In  addition, we observed that ADC accumulation retro-inhibited ADCS activity.  Altogether, these results indicate that channeling of NH(3) between the two  domains and/or amination of chorismate are the limiting step of the whole  process, and that ADC cannot accumulate.', '2011 Jan 1', 'Arch Biochem Biophys', '10.1016/j.abb.2010.09.010', 'Rebeille']
