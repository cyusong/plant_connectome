Plants adjust amplitude and duration of immune responses via different strategies to maintain growth, development, and resistance to pathogens. Pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) play vital roles. Pattern recognition receptors, comprising a large number of receptor-like protein kinases and receptor-like proteins, recognize related ligands and trigger immunity. PTI is the first layer of the innate immune system, and it recognizes PAMPs at the plasma membrane to prevent infection. However, pathogens exploit effector proteins to bypass or directly inhibit the PTI immune pathway. Consistently, plants have evolved intracellular nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins to detect pathogenic effectors and trigger a hypersensitive response to activate ETI. PTI and ETI work together to protect plants from infection by viruses and other pathogens. Diverse receptors and the corresponding ligands, especially several pairs of well-studied receptors and ligands in PTI immunity, are reviewed to illustrate the dynamic process of PTI response here.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
