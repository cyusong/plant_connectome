['18506098', 'The 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) II is a fatty-acid-related enzyme which  catalyzes the elongation of 16:0-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to 18:0-ACP in  plastids. The fatty acid biosynthesis 1-1 (fab1-1) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana  is partially deficient in its activity of Arabidopsis thaliana 3-ketoacyl-ACP  synthase 2 (AtKAS2), and its phenotype has been intensively studied in connection  with the chilling resistance and fatty acid composition. In this study, we used  the T-DNA insertion mutant of AtKAS2 to examine its possible role in plant  development. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed that the AtKAS2 gene was  expressed in various plant organs, except for roots, and was highly expressed in  siliques. The fusion of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) to the AtKAS2 promoter  demonstrated that the promoter was active in various tissues such as embryos,  stomatal guard cells, inflorescences and pollen grains. We were not able to  identify atkas2 homozygous mutant adult plants in heterozygous mutant progeny.  Phenotypic and genetic analyses showed that disruption of the AtKAS2 by T-DNA  insertion caused embryo lethality, and the development of the embryos was  arrested at the globular stage. Taken together, our results suggest that AtKAS2  is required for embryo development in Arabidopsis during the transition from the  globular to the heart stage.', '2008 Apr', 'Genes Genet Syst', '10.1266/ggs.83.143', 'Watanabe']
