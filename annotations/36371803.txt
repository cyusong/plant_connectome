The relationship between root, stem, and leaf hydraulic status and stomatal conductance during drought (field capacities: 100-25%) and drought recovery was studied in Helianthus annuus and five tree species (Populus×canadensis, Acer saccharum, A. saccharinum, Picea glauca, and Tsuga canadensis). Measurements of stomatal conductance (gs), organ water potential, and vessel embolism were performed and the following was observed: (i) cavitation only occurred in the petioles and not the roots or stems of tree species regardless of drought stress; (ii) in contrast, all H. annuus organs exhibited cavitation to an increasing degree from root to petiole; and (iii) all species initiated stomatal closure before cavitation events occurred or the expected turgor loss point was reached. After rewatering: (i) cavitated vessels in petioles of Acer species recovered whereas those of P. ×canadensis did not and leaves were shed; (ii) in H. annuus, cavitated xylem vessels were refilled in roots and petioles, but not in stems; and (iii) despite refilled embolisms in petioles of some species during drought recovery, gs never returned to pre-drought conditions. Conclusions are drawn with respect to the hydraulic segmentation hypothesis for above- and below-ground organs, and the timeline of embolism occurrence and repair is discussed.
