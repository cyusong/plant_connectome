['19918071', 'Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Pi-0 is resistant to Pseudomonas syringae pathovar  tomato (Pst) strain DC3000 expressing the T3S effector protein AvrBsT. Resistance  is due to a loss of function mutation (sober1-1) in a conserved alpha/beta  hydrolase, SOBER1 (Suppressor of AvrBsT Elicited Resistance1). Members of this  superfamily possess phospholipase and carboxylesterase activity with diverse  substrate specificity. The nature of SOBER1 enzymatic activity and substrate  specificity was not known. SOBER1-dependent suppression of the hypersensitive  response (HR) in Pi-0 suggested that it might hydrolyze a plant lipid or  precursor required for HR induction. Here, we show that Pi-0 leaves infected with  Pst DC3000 expressing AvrBsT accumulated higher levels of phosphatidic acid (PA)  compared to leaves infected with Pst DC3000. Phospholipase D (PLD) activity was  required for high PA levels and AvrBsT-dependent HR in Pi-0. Overexpression of  SOBER1 in Pi-0 reduced PA levels and inhibited HR. These data implicated PA,  phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) as potential SOBER1  substrates. Recombinant His(6)-SOBER1 hydrolyzed PC but not PA or LysoPC in vitro  indicating that the enzyme has phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity. Chemical  inhibition of PLA(2) activity in leaves expressing SOBER1 resulted in HR in  response to Pst DC3000 AvrBsT. These data are consistent with the model that  SOBER1 PLA(2) activity suppresses PLD-dependent production of PA in response to  AvrBsT elicitation. This work highlights an important role for SOBER1 in the  regulation of PA levels generated in plants in response to biotic stress.', '2009 Dec 1', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0903859106', 'Mudgett']
