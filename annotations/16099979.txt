['16099979', 'FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is a conserved promoter of flowering that acts downstream  of various regulatory pathways, including one that mediates photoperiodic  induction through CONSTANS (CO), and is expressed in the vasculature of  cotyledons and leaves. A bZIP transcription factor, FD, preferentially expressed  in the shoot apex is required for FT to promote flowering. FD and FT are  interdependent partners through protein interaction and act at the shoot apex to  promote floral transition and to initiate floral development through  transcriptional activation of a floral meristem identity gene, APETALA1 (AP1). FT  may represent a long-distance signal in flowering.', '2005 Aug 12', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1115983', 'Araki']
