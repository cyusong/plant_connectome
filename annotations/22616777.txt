• Excellent visualization of nuclei was obtained here using a whole-mount procedure adapted to provide high-resolution images of large, irregularly shaped nuclei. The procedure is based on tissue clearing, and fluorescent staining of nuclear DNA with the dye propidium iodide. • The method developed for standard confocal imaging was applied to large multicellular root swellings, named galls, induced in plant hosts by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. • Here, we performed a functional analysis, and examined the nuclear structure in giant feeding cells overexpressing the cell cycle inhibitor Kip-related protein 4 (KRP4). Ectopic KRP4 expression in galls led to aberrant nuclear structure, disturbing giant cell expansion and nematode reproduction. In vivo live-cell imaging of GFP-KRP4 demonstrated that this protein co-localizes to chromosomes from prophase to late anaphase during cell cycle progression. • The data presented here suggest the involvement of KRP4 during mitotic progression in plant cells. The detailed results obtained using confocal analysis also demonstrate the potential utility of a rapid, easy-to-use clearing method for the analysis of the nuclei of certain Arabidopsis mutants and other complex plant nuclei.
