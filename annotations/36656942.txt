The advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) genome editing, coupled with advances in computing and imaging capabilities, has initiated a new era in which genetic diseases and individual disease susceptibilities are both predictable and actionable. Likewise, genes responsible for plant traits can be identified and altered quickly, transforming the pace of agricultural research and plant breeding. In this Review, we discuss the current state of CRISPR-mediated genetic manipulation in human cells, animals, and plants along with relevant successes and challenges and present a roadmap for the future of this technology.
