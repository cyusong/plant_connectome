Wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) is one of the most important crops in the world. Chlorophyll plays a vital role in plant development and crop improvement and further determines the crop productivity to a certain extent. The biosynthesis of chlorophyll remains a complex metabolic process, and fundamental biochemical discoveries have resulted from studies of plant mutants with altered leaf color. In this study, we identified a chlorophyll-deficiency mutant, referred to as <i>chli</i>, from the wheat cultivar Shaannong33 that exhibited an obvious pale-green leaf phenotype at the seedling stage, with significantly decreased accumulation of chlorophyll and its precursors, protoporphyrin IX and Mg-protoporphyrin IX. Interestingly, a higher protoporphyrin IX to Mg-protoporphyrin IX ratio was observed in <i>chli</i>. Lipid biosynthesis in <i>chli</i> leaves and seeds was also affected, with the mutant displaying significantly reduced total lipid content relative to Shaanong33. Genetic analysis indicated that the pale-green leaf phenotype was controlled by a single pair of recessive nuclear genes. Furthermore, sequence alignment revealed a single-nucleotide mutation (G664A) in the gene TraesCS7A01G480700.1, which encodes subunit I of the Mg-chelatase in plants. This single-nucleotide mutation resulted in an amino acid substitution (D221N) in the highly conserved domain of subunit I. As a result, mutant protein Tachli-7A lost the ability to interact with the normal protein TaCHLI-7A, as assessed by yeast two-hybrid assay. Meanwhile, <i>Tachli-7A</i> could not recover the chlorophyll deficiency phenotype of the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> SALK_050029 mutant. Furthermore, we found that in Shaannong33, the protoporphyrin IX to Mg-protoporphyrin IX ratio was growth state-dependent and insensitive to environmental change. Overall, the mutation in Tachli-7A impaired the function of Mg-chelatase and blocked the conversion of protoporphyrin IX to Mg- protoporphyrin IX. Based on our results, the <i>chli</i> mutant represents a potentially useful resource for better understanding chlorophyll and lipid biosynthetic pathways in common wheat.
