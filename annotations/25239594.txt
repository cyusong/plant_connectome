As all plastids that have been investigated so far can be traced back to endosymbiotic uptake of cyanobacteria by heterotrophic host cells, they accordingly show a high similarity regarding photosynthesis, which includes both the photosystems and the biochemical reactions around the CO2 fixation via the Calvin-Bassham cycle. Major differences between the different algal and plant groups may include the presence or absence of carbon concentrating mechanisms, pyrenoids, Rubisco activases, carbonic anhydrases as well as differences in the regulation of the Calvin-Bassham cycle. This review describes the diversity of primary carbon fixation steps in algae and plants and the respective regulatory mechanisms.
