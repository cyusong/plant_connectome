Theory predicts that sexual behaviour in animals can evolve rapidly, accelerating the rate of species formation. Here we estimate the rate of speciation in Laupala, a group of forest-dwelling Hawaiian crickets that is characterized primarily through differences in male courtship song. We find that Laupala has the highest rate of speciation so far recorded in arthropods, supporting the idea that divergence in courtship or sexual behaviour drives rapid speciation in animals.

Laupala: !characterized by! Male courtship song
Sexual behaviour: !evolves rapidly! Species formation
Laupala: !has highest rate of! Speciation 
Courtship/sexual behaviour: !drives rapid! Speciation
