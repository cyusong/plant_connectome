The root system of potato is made up of adventitious roots (AR) that form at the base of a sprout once it emerges from the mother tuber. By definition, AR originate from dormant preformed meristems, or from cells neighboring vascular tissues in stems or leaves. This may occur as part of the developmental program of the plant (e.g., potato), or when replacing the embryonic primary roots in response to stress conditions, such as flooding, nutrient deprivation, or wounding. AR formation is studied mainly in cereals and model plants, and less is known about its developmental program in root and tuber crops. In this review, we summarize the recent data on AR development in potato and relate this knowledge to what is known from model plants. For example, AR formation following stem cutting in potato follows a pattern of initiation, expression, and emergence phases that are known for other plants and involves auxin, the master regulator of AR induction and development. Molecular regulation of AR formation and the effect of environmental stresses are discussed. Understanding the origin and nature of AR systems in important crops will contribute to increased production and improve global food security.
