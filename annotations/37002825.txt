Pollen tubes extend rapidly via tip growth. This process depends on a dynamic actin cytoskeleton, which has been implicated in controlling organelle movements, cytoplasmic streaming, vesicle trafficking, and cytoplasm organization in pollen tubes. In this update review, we describe the progress in understanding the organization and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and the function of the actin cytoskeleton in controlling vesicle traffic and cytoplasmic organization in pollen tubes. We also discuss the interplay between ion gradients and the actin cytoskeleton that regulates the spatial arrangement and dynamics of actin filaments and the organization of the cytoplasm in pollen tubes. Finally, we describe several signaling components that regulate actin dynamics in pollen tubes.

Pollen tubes: !extend via! tip growth
Actin cytoskeleton: !controls! organelle movements
Actin cytoskeleton: !regulates! vesicle trafficking
Ion gradients: !regulate! actin filaments
Signaling components: !regulate! actin dynamics
