Two key transcription factors (TFs) in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1), belong to a small family with four BES1/BZR1 homologs (BEH1-4). To date, in contrast to the wealth of knowledge regarding BES1 and BZR1, little is known about BEH1-4. Here, we show that <i>BEH2</i> was expressed preferentially in the roots and leaf margins including serrations, which was quite different from another member <i>BEH4</i>, and that BRs downregulated <i>BEH2</i> through a module containing GSK3-like kinases and BES1/BZR1 TFs, among which BES1, rather than BZR1, contributed to this process. In addition, BEH2 consistently existed in the nucleus, suggesting that its subcellular localization is not under BR-dependent nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling control. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis on RNA-seq data indicated that BEH2 may be implicated in stress response and photosynthesis. These findings might assist in the future elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying BR signaling.
