['25033056', "Sister chromatid cohesion, which is mediated by the cohesin complex, is essential  for the proper segregation of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis. The  establishment of stable sister chromatid cohesion occurs during DNA replication  and involves acetylation of the complex by the acetyltransferase CTF7. In higher  eukaryotes, the majority of cohesin complexes are removed from chromosomes during  prophase. Studies in fly and human have shown that this process involves the WAPL  mediated opening of the cohesin ring at the junction between the SMC3 ATPase  domain and the N-terminal domain of cohesin's alpha-kleisin subunit. We report here  the isolation and detailed characterization of WAPL in Arabidopsis thaliana. We  show that Arabidopsis contains two WAPL genes, which share overlapping functions.  Plants in which both WAPL genes contain T-DNA insertions show relatively normal  growth and development but exhibit a significant reduction in male and female  fertility. The removal of cohesin from chromosomes during meiotic prophase is  blocked in Atwapl mutants resulting in chromosome bridges, broken chromosomes and  uneven chromosome segregation. In contrast, while subtle mitotic alterations are  observed in some somatic cells, cohesin complexes appear to be removed normally.  Finally, we show that mutations in AtWAPL suppress the lethality associated with  inactivation of AtCTF7. Taken together our results demonstrate that WAPL plays a  critical role in meiosis and raises the possibility that mechanisms involved in  the prophase removal of cohesin may vary between mitosis and meiosis in plants.", '2014 Jul', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1004497', 'Makaroff']
