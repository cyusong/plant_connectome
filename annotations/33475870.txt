A genome-wide analysis of longan miRNA genes was conducted, and full-length pri-miRNA transcripts were cloned. Bioinformatics and expression analyses contributed to the functional characterization of longan miRNA genes. MicroRNAs are important for the post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. However, little is known about the transcription and regulation of miRNA genes in longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.). In this study, 80 miRNA precursors (pre-miRNA) were predicted, and their secondary structure, size, conservation, and diversity were analyzed. Furthermore, the full-length cDNA sequences of 13 longan primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) were amplified by RLM-RACE and SMART-RACE and analyzed, which revealed that longan pri-miRNA transcripts have multiple transcription start sites (TSSs) and the downstream pre-miRNAs are polymorphic. Accordingly, the longan pri-miRNAs and protein-encoding genes may have similar transcriptional specificities. An analysis of the longan miRNA gene promoter elements indicated that the three most abundant cis-acting elements were light-responsive, stress-responsive, and hormone-responsive elements. A quantitative real-time PCR assay elucidated the potential spatial and temporal expression patterns of longan pre-miRNAs during the early stages of somatic embryogenesis (SE) and in different longan organs/tissues. This is the first report regarding the molecular characterization of miRNA genes and their expression profiles in longan. The generated data may serve as a foundation for future research aimed at clarifying the longan miRNA gene functions.
