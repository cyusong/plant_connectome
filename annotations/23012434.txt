Cu is an essential element for plant growth, but the molecular mechanisms of its distribution and redistribution within the plants are unknown. Here, we report that Yellow stripe-like16 (YSL16) is involved in Cu distribution and redistribution in rice (Oryza sativa). Rice YSL16 was expressed in the roots, leaves, and unelongated nodes at the vegetative growth stage and highly expressed in the upper nodes at the reproductive stage. YSL16 was expressed at the phloem of nodes and vascular tissues of leaves. Knockout of this gene resulted in a higher Cu concentration in the older leaves but a lower concentration in the younger leaves at the vegetative stage. At the reproductive stage, a higher Cu concentration was found in the flag leaf and husk, but less Cu was present in the brown rice, resulting in a significant reduction in fertility in the knockout line. Isotope labeling experiments with (65)Cu showed that the mutant lost the ability to transport Cu-nicotianamine from older to younger leaves and from the flag leaf to the panicle. Rice YSL16 transported the Cu-nicotianamine complex in yeast. Taken together, our results indicate that Os-YSL16 is a Cu-nicotianamine transporter that is required for delivering Cu to the developing young tissues and seeds through phloem transport.
