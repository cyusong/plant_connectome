['9188533', 'The plant hormone auxin regulates plant physiology by modulating the interaction  of transcription factors with auxin response elements (AuxREs) of the affected  genes. A transcription factor, Auxin Response Factor 1 (ARF1), that binds to the  sequence TGTCTC in AuxREs was cloned from Arabidopsis by using a yeast one-hybrid  system. ARF1 has an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain related to the carboxyl  terminus of the maize transactivator Viviparous-1. Sequence requirements for ARF1  binding in vitro are identical to those that confer auxin responsiveness in vivo.  The carboxyl terminus of ARF1 contains two motifs found in the Aux/IAA class of  proteins and appears to mediate protein-protein interactions.', '1997 Jun 20', 'Science', '10.1126/science.276.5320.1865', 'Guilfoyle']
