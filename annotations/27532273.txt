Proprioception, the perception of the self, is particularly key to the question of the reproducibility of shapes: the many regulators of growth may lead to a large array of geometries, but shape sensing restricts these diverse outputs to a limited number of forms. Mechanistically, and in addition to geometrical feedback onto the diffusion and transport of molecular factors, we highlight the role of shape-derived mechanical stress and strain in this process. Through examples at the cell, tissue and organism scales, it appears that such mechanical feedback adds robustness to morphogenesis. Interestingly, synergies exist between shape sensing and response to external cues, such as wind and gravity. Understanding the molecular basis of proprioception is now within reach and opens up many avenues for an integrative view of development.
