['28776932', 'Two yeast Brix family members Ssf1 and Ssf2, involved in large ribosomal subunit  synthesis, are essential for yeast cell viability and mating efficiency. Their  putative homologs exist in the Arabidopsis genome; however, their role in plant  development is unknown. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana SNAIL1  (AtSNAIL1), a protein sharing high sequence identity with yeast Ssf1 and Ssf2, is  critical to mitosis progression of female gametophyte development. The snail1  homozygous mutant was nonviable and its heterozygous mutant was semi-sterile with  shorter siliques. The mutation in SNAIL1 led to absence of female transmission  and reduced male transmission. Further phenotypic analysis showed that the  synchronic development of female gametophyte in the snail1 heterozygous mutant  was greatly impaired and the snail1 pollen tube growth, in vivo, was also  compromised. Furthermore, SNAIL1 was a nucleolar-localized protein with a  putative role in protein synthesis. Our data suggest that SNAIL1 may function in  ribosome biogenesis like Ssf1 and Ssf2 and plays an important role during  megagametogenesis in Arabidopsis.', '2017 Sep', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.12572', 'Qu']
