During microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity more than 5000 Arabidopsis genes are significantly altered in their expression, and the question arises, how such an enormous reprogramming of the transcriptome can be regulated in a safe and robust manner? For the WRKY transcription factors (TFs), which are important regulators of numerous defense responses, it appears that they act in a complex regulatory sub-network rather than in a linear fashion, which would be much more vulnerable to gene function loss either by pathogen-derived effectors or by mutations. In this study we employed RNA-seq, mass spectrometry and chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq to find evidence for and uncover principles and characteristics of this network. Upon flg22-treatment, one can distinguish between two sets of WRKY genes: constitutively expressed and induced WRKY genes. Prior to elicitation the induced WRKY genes appear to be maintained in a repressed state mainly by the constitutively expressed WRKY factors, which themselves appear to be regulated by non-WRKY TFs. Upon elicitation, induced WRKYs rapidly bind to induced WRKY gene promoters and by auto- and cross-regulation build up the regulatory network. Maintenance of this flg22-induced network appears highly robust as removal of three key WRKY factors can be physically and functionally compensated for by other WRKY family members.

WRKY TFs: !regulate! Constitutively expressed WRKY genes
Constitutively expressed WRKY genes: !maintain in repressed state! Induced WRKY genes
Non-WRKY TFs: !regulate! Constitutively expressed WRKY genes
Induced WRKY genes: !bind to! Induced WRKY gene promoters
WRKY family members: !compensate for! Removal of three key WRKY factors
