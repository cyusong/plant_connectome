Starch granules in the endodermis of plant hypocotyls act as statoliths that promote hypocotyl negative gravitropism-the directional growth of hypocotyls against gravity-in the dark. To identify the molecular components that regulate hypocotyl negative gravitropism, we performed a mutagenesis screen and isolated <i>reduced gravitropic 1</i> (<i>rgv1</i>) mutants that lack starch granules in their hypocotyl endodermis and show reduced hypocotyl negative gravitropism in the dark. Using whole genome sequencing, we identified three different <i>rgv1</i> mutants that are allelic to the previously reported <i>early starvation 1</i> mutant, which is rapidly depleted of starch just before the dawn. <i>ESV1</i> orthologs are present in starch-producing green organisms, suggesting <i>ESV1</i> is a functionally conserved protein necessary for the formation of starch granules. Consistent with this, we found that liverwort and rice <i>ESV1</i> can complement the Arabidopsis <i>ESV1</i> mutant phenotype for both starch granules and hypocotyl negative gravitropism. To further investigate the function of <i>ESV1</i> in other plants, we isolated rice <i>ESV1</i> mutants and found that they show reduced levels of starch in their leaves and loosely packed starch granules in their grains. Both Arabidopsis and rice <i>ESV1</i> mutants also lack starch granules in root columella and show reduced root gravitropism. Together, these results indicate <i>ESV1</i> is a functionally conserved protein that promotes gravitropic responses in plants via its role in starch granule formation.
