Rice WSL6 is involved in chloroplast ribosome biogenesis and is essential for early chloroplast development. Construction of the genetic translation system is a prerequisite for chloroplast development in plants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is largely unknown. Here, we isolated a white stripe leaf6 (wsl6) mutant in rice. The mutant seedlings displayed white-striped leaves that were more severe under low-temperature conditions. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the wsl6 mutant was defective in early chloroplast development. Map-based cloning revealed that WSL6 encodes an Era-type guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein located in chloroplasts. Immunoblotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses demonstrated an absence of 70S ribosomes in wsl6 chloroplasts. Further research showed that WSL6 binds to the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) subunit of chloroplast ribosome 30S. In summary, these results show that WSL6 is essential for chloroplast ribosome biogenesis during early chloroplast development in rice.
