['30307069', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA)-induced leaf senescence facilitates nutrient  reuse and potentially contributes to enhancing plant stress tolerance. However,  excessive senescence causes serious reductions in crop yield, and the mechanism  by which senescence is finely tuned at different levels is still insufficiently  understood. Here, we found that the double mutant of core enzymes of the polycomb  repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is hypersensitive to ABA in Arabidopsis thaliana. To  elucidate the interplay between ABA and PRC2 at the genome level, we extensively  profiled the transcriptomic and epigenomic changes triggered by ABA. We observed  that H3K27me3 preferentially targets ABA-induced senescence-associated genes  (SAGs). In the double, but not single, mutant of PRC2 enzymes, these SAGs were  derepressed and could be more highly induced by ABA compared with the wild-type,  suggesting a redundant role for the PRC2 enzymes in negatively regulating  ABA-induced senescence. Contrary to the rapid transcriptomic changes triggered by  ABA, the reduction of H3K27me3 at these SAGs falls far behind the induction of  their expression, indicating that PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 contributed to long-term  damping of ABA-induced senescence to prevent an oversensitive response. The  findings of this study may serve as a paradigm for a global understanding of the  interplay between the rapid effects of a phytohormone such as ABA and the  long-term effects of the epigenetic machinery in regulating plant senescence  processes and environmental responses.', '2019 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14125', 'Zhang']
