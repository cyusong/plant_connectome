This paper reviews the progress of development of plants with desirable starch structure by modifying starch branching enzymes. Starch-branching enzyme (SBE) is responsible for the creation of branches during starch biosynthesis in plastids, and is a major determinant of the final fine structure and physical properties of the starch. Multiple isoforms of SBE have been found in plants, with each playing a different role in amylopectin synthesis. Different methods have been used to develop desirable starch structures by modifying the SBE activity. These can involve changing its expression level (either up-regulation or down-regulation), genetically modifying the activity of the SBE itself, and varying the length of its transferred chains. Changing the activity and the transferred chain length of SBE has been less studied than changing the expression level of SBE in vivo. This article reviews and summarizes new tools for developing plants producing the next generation of starches.
