Flow cytometry was used to quantify the effect of individual and combined stress treatments on elicitation of androgenesis by analyzing the relative nuclear DNA content of in vitro cultured microspores of Pisum sativum L. Differences in relative nuclear DNA content of microspores within anthers after stress treatments were clearly evident from the flow cytometry profiles, and permitted us to predict whether a combination of stresses were elicitors or enhancers of androgenesis. This is the first report to assess the effect of various stress treatments in a plant species based on relative nuclear DNA content and to use this information to categorize them as 'elicitors' or 'enhancers'. Flow cytometry represents a simple, quick and reliable way to analyze and discriminate the effect of various stress treatments on elicitation of androgenesis. These results form a solid basis for further efforts designed to enhance responses and to extend double haploid technology to other legumes.
