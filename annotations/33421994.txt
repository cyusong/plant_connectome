Abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in plant growth and adaptation through the ABA signaling pathway. The ABA-responsive element binding (AREB/ABF) family transcriptional factors are central regulators that integrate ABA signaling with various signaling pathways. It has long been known that ABA inhibits rhizobial infection and nodule formation in legumes, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that nodulation is very sensitive to ABA and exogenous ABA dramatically inhibits rhizobial infection and nodule formation in soybean. In addition, we proved that GmbZIP1, an AREB/ABF transcription factor, is a major regulator in both nodulation and plant response to ABA in soybean. GmbZIP1 was specifically expressed during nodule formation and development. Overexpression of GmbZIP1 resulted in reduced rhizobial infection and decreased nodule number. Furthermore, GmbZIP1 is responsive to ABA, and ectopic overexpression of GmbZIP1 increased sensitivity of Arabidopsis plants to ABA during seed germination and postgerminative growth, and conferred enhanced drought tolerance of plants. Remarkably, we found that GmbZIP1 directly binds to the promoter of GmENOD40-1, a marker gene for nodule formation, to repress its expression. Our results identified GmbZIP1 as a node regulator that integrates ABA signaling with nodulation signaling to negatively regulate nodule formation.
