['29687222', 'AtPPR4-mediated trans-splicing of plastid rps12 transcripts is essential for key  embryo morphogenetic events such as development of cotyledons, determination of  provascular tissue, and organization of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), but not  for the formation of the protodermal layer. Members of the pentatricopeptide  repeat (PPR) containing protein family have emerged as key regulators of the  organelle post-transcriptional processing and to be essential for proper plant  embryo development. In this study, we report the functional characterization of  the AtPPR4 (At5g04810) gene encoding a plastid nucleoid PPR protein. In-situ  hybridization analysis reveals the presence of AtPPR4 transcripts already at the  transition stage of embryo development. As a consequence, embryos lacking the  AtPPR4 protein arrest their development at the transition/early-heart stages and  show defects in the determination of the provascular tissue and organization of  SAM. This complex phenotype is due to the specific role of AtPPR4 in the  trans-splicing of the plastid rps12 transcripts, as shown by northern and  slot-blot hybridizations, and the consequent defect in 70S ribosome accumulation  and plastid protein synthesis, in agreement with the role proposed for the maize  orthologue, ZmPPR4.', '2018 Jul', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-018-2896-8', 'ORCID:']
