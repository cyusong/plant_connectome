['26562806', 'The composition of LHCII trimers as well as excitation energy transfer and charge  separation in grana cores of Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lacking chlorophyll a/b  binding protein Lhcb3 have been investigated and compared to those in wild-type  plants. In grana cores of lhcb3 plants we observed increased amounts of Lhcb1 and  Lhcb2 apoproteins per PSII core. The additional copies of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 are  expected to substitute for Lhcb3 in LHCII trimers M as well as in the LHCII  "extra" pool, which was found to be modestly enlarged as a result of the absence  of Lhcb3. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements reveal a deceleration of the  fast phase of excitation dynamics in grana cores of the mutant by ~15 ps, whereas  the average fluorescence lifetime is not significantly altered. Monte Carlo  modeling predicts a slowing down of the mean hopping time and an increased  stabilization of the primary charge separation in the mutant. Thus our data imply  that absence of apoprotein Lhcb3 results in detectable differences in excitation  energy transfer and charge separation.', '2015 Dec', 'J Photochem Photobiol B', '10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2015.11.002', 'Jackowski']
