Brake fern, Pteris vittata, not only tolerates arsenic but also hyperaccumulates it in the frond. The hypothesis that arsenic hyperaccumulation in this fern could function as a defense against insect herbivory was tested. Fronds from control and arsenic-treated ferns were presented to nymphs of the grasshopper Schistocerca americana. Feeding damage was recorded by visual observation and quantification of the fresh weight of frond left uneaten and number of fecal pellets produced over a 2-d period. Grasshopper weight was determined before and after 5 d of feeding. Grasshoppers consumed significantly greater amounts of the frond tissue, produced more fecal pellets and had increased body weight on control plants compared with grasshoppers fed arsenic-treated ferns. Very little or none of the arsenic-treated ferns were consumed indicating feeding deterrence. In a feeding deterrent experiment with lettuce, sodium arsenite at 1.0 mm deterred grasshoppers from feeding whereas 0.1 mm did not. In a choice experiment, grasshoppers preferred to feed on lettuce dipped in water compared with lettuce dipped in 1.0 mm sodium arsenite. Our results show that arsenic hyperaccumulation in brake fern is an elemental defense against grasshopper herbivory.
