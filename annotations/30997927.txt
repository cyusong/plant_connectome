Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of the light energy absorbed is one of the main photoprotective mechanisms evolved by oxygenic photosynthetic organisms to avoid photodamage, at a cost of reduced photosynthetic efficiency. Tuning of NPQ has been reported as a promising biotechnological strategy to increase productivity in both higher plants and unicellular microalgae. Engineering of NPQ induction requires the comprehension of its molecular mechanism(s), strongly debated in the last three decades with several different models proposed. In this work, the molecular details of NPQ induction was investigated at intramolecular level by in vitro and in vitro site-specific mutagenesis on chlorophyll binding sites of the Light-Harvesting Complex Stress-Related 3 (LHCSR3) protein, the pigment binding complexes identified as the quencher during NPQ induction in the model organism for green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The results obtained demonstrate a correlation between the quenching activity of LHCSR3 variants in vitro and the NPQ phenotypes observed in vivo. In particular, multiple quenching sites in LHCSR3 cooperatively dissipating the excitation energy were revealed with a peculiar role of Chl 613, a chromophore located a close distance to carotenoid binding site L1.
