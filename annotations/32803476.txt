Enhanced bioactive JA (JA-Ile) accumulation in OsJAZ9 overexpressing rice helps plants tolerate K deficiency. Potassium (K) represents up to 10% of the plant's total dry biomass, and its deficiency makes plants highly susceptible to both abiotic and biotic stresses. K shortage results in the inhibition of root and shoots growth, but the underlying mechanism of this response is unclear. Our RNA-Seq and qPCR analysis suggested leading roles for JA pathway genes under K deficiency in rice. Notably, K deficiency and JA application produced similar phenotypic and transcriptional responses. Here, we integrated molecular, physiological and morphological studies to analyze the role of OsJAZ9 in JA homeostasis and K deficiency responses. We raised OsJAZ9 over-expression, knockdown, transcriptional reporter, translational reporter and C-terminal deleted translational reporter lines in rice to establish the role of JA signaling in K ion homeostasis. JA profiling revealed significantly increased JA-Ile levels in OsJAZ9 OE lines under K deficiency. Furthermore, we established that OsJAZ9 overexpression and knockdown result in K deficiency tolerance and sensitivity, respectively, by modulating various K transporters and root system architecture. Our data provide evidence on the crucial roles of OsJAZ9 for improving K deficiency tolerance in rice by altering JA levels and JA responses.
