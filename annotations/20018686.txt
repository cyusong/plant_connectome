['20018686', 'Plants and animals rely on innate immunity to prevent infections by detection of  microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) through pattern-recognition  receptors (PRRs). The plant PRR FLS2, a leucine-rich repeat-receptor kinase,  recognizes bacterial flagellin and initiates immune signaling by association with  another leucine-rich repeat-receptor-like kinase, BAK1. It remains unknown how  the FLS2/BAK1 receptor complex activates intracellular signaling cascades. Here  we identified the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 that is rapidly  phosphorylated upon flagellin perception, depending on both FLS2 and BAK1. BIK1  associates with FLS2 and BAK1 in vivo and in vitro. BIK1 is phosphorylated by  BAK1, and BIK1 also directly phosphorylates BAK1 and FLS2 in vitro. The flagellin  phosphorylation site Thr(237) of BIK1 is required for its phosphorylation on BAK1  and FLS2, suggesting that BIK1 is likely first phosphorylated upon flagellin  perception and subsequently transphosphorylates FLS2/BAK1 to propagate flagellin  signaling. Importantly, bik1 mutants are compromised in diverse  flagellin-mediated responses and immunity to the nonpathogenic bacterial  infection. Thus, BIK1 is an essential component in MAMP signal transduction,  which links the MAMP receptor complex to downstream intracellular signaling.', '2010 Jan 5', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0909705107', 'He']
