Protein kinases constitute essential regulatory components in the majority of cellular processes in eukaryotic cells. The CBL-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE (CIPK) family of plant protein kinases functions in calcium (Ca2+)-related signaling pathways and is therefore involved in the response to a wide variety of signals in plants. By covalently linking phosphate groups to their target proteins, CIPKs regulate the activity of downstream targets, their localization, their stability and their ability to interact with other proteins. In Arabidopsis, the CIPK23 kinase has emerged as a major hub driving root responses to diverse environmental stresses, including drought, salinity and nutrient imbalances, such as potassium, nitrate and iron deficiencies, as well as ammonium, magnesium and non-iron metal toxicities. This review will chiefly report on the prominent roles of CIPK23 in the regulation of plant nutrient transporters and on the underlying molecular mechanisms. We will also discuss the different scenarios explaining how a single promiscuous kinase, such as CIPK23, may convey specific responses to a myriad of signals.
