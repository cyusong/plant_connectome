['20031914', 'The circadian clock regulates the expression of an array of Arabidopsis genes  such as those encoding the LIGHT-HARVESTING CHLOROPHYLL A/B (Lhcb) proteins. We  have previously studied the promoters of two of these Arabidopsis genes--Lhcb1*1  and Lhcb1*3--and identified a sequence that binds the clock protein CIRCADIAN  CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1). This sequence, designated CCA1-binding site (CBS), is  necessary for phytochrome and circadian responsiveness of these genes. In close  proximity to this sequence, there exists a G-box core element that has been shown  to bind the bZIP transcription factor HY5 in other light-regulated plant  promoters. In the present study, we examined the importance of the interaction of  transcription factors binding the CBS and the G-box core element in the control  of normal circadian rhythmic expression of Lhcb genes. Our results show that HY5  is able to specifically bind the G-box element in the Lhcb promoters and that  CCA1 can alter the binding activity of HY5. We further show that CCA1 and HY5 can  physically interact and that they can act synergistically on transcription in a  yeast reporter gene assay. An absence of HY5 leads to a shorter period of Lhcb1*1  circadian expression but does not affect the circadian expression of CATALASE3  (CAT3), whose promoter lacks a G-box element. Our results suggest that  interaction of the HY5 and CCA1 proteins on Lhcb promoters is necessary for  normal circadian expression of the Lhcb genes.', '2008 Jan', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssm005', 'Tobin']
