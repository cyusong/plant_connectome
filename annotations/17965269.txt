['17965269', 'SPO11, a homolog of the subunit A of the archaebacterial topoisomerase VI, is  essential for double-strand break (DSB)-induced initiation of meiotic  recombination. In contrast with single homologs in animals and yeasts, three  homologs are present in Arabidopsis thaliana and other higher plants. Whereas At  SPO11-3 is involved in somatic endoreduplication, At SPO11-1 and, as recently  shown, At SPO11-2 are essential for the initiation of meiotic recombination.  Further defining the role of At SPO11-2, we were able to demonstrate that it is  required for proper chromosome segregation, as its loss resulted in aneuploidy in  the surviving progeny. The double mutant spo11-1 spo11-2 does not differ  phenotypically from the single mutants, indicating that both proteins are  required for the same step. Contrary to the observations for the At rad51-1  single mutant, the combination of spo11-2 and rad51-1 did not lead to chromosome  fragmentation, indicating that SPO11-2, like SPO11-1, is required for DSB  induction. As the meiotic phenotype of both single SPO11 mutants can be reversed  by complementation using the full-length genes but not the same constructs  mutated in their respective catalytically active Tyr, both proteins seem to  participate directly in the DNA breakage reaction. The active involvement of two  SPO11 homologs for DSB formation reveals a striking difference between plants and  other eukaryotes in meiosis.', '2007 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.054817', 'Puchta']
