We performed whole-genome sequencing of two phytoplasmas associated with sugarcane grassy shoot (SCGS) and Bermuda grass white leaf diseases. These are the first draft genomes of SCGS phytoplasma (strain SCGS) and '<i>Candidatus</i> Phytoplasma cynodontis' (strain LW01) and may help to delineate these phytoplasmas at a finer taxonomic level.
