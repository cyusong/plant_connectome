['17971041', 'The 26S proteasome (26SP) is a multi-subunit, multi-catalytic protease that is  responsible for most of the cytosolic and nuclear protein turnover. The 26SP is  composed of two sub-particles, the 19S regulatory particle (RP) that binds and  unfolds protein targets, and the 20S core particle (20SP) that degrades proteins  into small peptides. Most 26SP targets are conjugated to a poly-ubiquitin (Ub)  chain that serves as a degradation signal. However, some targets, such as  oxidized proteins, do not require a poly-Ub tag for proteasomal degradation, and  recent studies have shown that the main protease in this Ub-independent pathway  is free 20SP. It is currently unknown how the ratio of 26SP- to 20SP-dependent  proteolysis is controlled. Here we show that loss of function of the Arabidopsis  RP subunits RPT2a, RPN10 and RPN12a leads to decreased 26SP accumulation,  resulting in reduced rates of Ub-dependent proteolysis. In contrast, all three RP  mutants have increased 20SP levels and thus enhanced Ub-independent protein  degradation. As a consequence of this shift in proteolytic activity, mutant  seedlings are hypersensitive to stresses that cause protein misfolding, and have  increased tolerance to treatments that promote protein oxidation. Taken together,  the data show that plant cells increase 20SP-dependent proteolysis when 26SP  activity is impaired.', '2008 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03322.x', 'Smalle']
