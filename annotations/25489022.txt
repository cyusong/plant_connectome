['25489022', "The eukaryotic, highly conserved serine (Ser)/threonine-specific protein  phosphatase 2A (PP2A) functions as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a  catalytic (C), scaffolding (A), and regulatory (B) subunit. In Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana), five, three, and 17 genes encode different C, A, and B  subunits, respectively. We previously found that a B subunit, B'theta, localized to  peroxisomes due to its C-terminal targeting signal Ser-Ser-leucine. This work  shows that PP2A C2, C5, andA2 subunits interact and colocalize with B'theta in  peroxisomes. C and A subunits lack peroxisomal targeting signals, and their  peroxisomal import depends on B'theta and appears to occur by piggybacking transport.  B'theta knockout mutants were impaired in peroxisomal beta-oxidation as shown by  developmental arrest of seedlings germinated without sucrose, accumulation of  eicosenoic acid, and resistance to protoauxins indole-butyric acid and  2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid. All of these observations strongly substantiate  that a full PP2A complex is present in peroxisomes and positively affects  beta-oxidation of fatty acids and protoauxins.", '2015 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.254409', 'Lillo']
