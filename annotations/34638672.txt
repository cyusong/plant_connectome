Flowering is an important developmental process from vegetative to reproductive growth in plant; thus, it is necessary to analyze the genes involved in the regulation of flowering time. The MADS-box transcription factor family exists widely in plants and plays an important role in the regulation of flowering time. However, the molecular mechanism of <i>GmFULc</i> involved in the regulation of plant flowering is not very clear. In this study, GmFULc protein had a typical MADS domain and it was a member of MADS-box transcription factor family. The expression analysis revealed that <i>GmFULc</i> was induced by short days (SD) and regulated by the circadian clock. Compared to wild type (WT), overexpression of <i>GmFULc</i> in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> caused significantly earlier flowering time, while <i>ful</i> mutants flowered later, and overexpression of <i>GmFULc</i> rescued the late-flowering phenotype of <i>ful</i> mutants. ChIP-seq of GmFULc binding sites identified potential direct targets, including <i>TOPLESS</i> (<i>TPL</i>), and it inhibited the transcriptional activity of <i>TPL</i>. In addition, the transcription levels of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>), <i>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1</i> (<i>SOC1</i>) and <i>LEAFY</i> (<i>LFY</i>) in the downstream of <i>TPL</i> were increased in <i>GmFULc-</i>&nbsp;<i>overexpression</i><i>Arabidopsis</i>, suggesting that the early flowering phenotype was associated with up-regulation of these genes. Our results suggested that GmFULc inhibited the transcriptional activity of <i>TPL</i> and induced expression of <i>FT</i>, <i>SOC1</i> and <i>LFY</i> to promote flowering.
