The anthocyanin content is an important indicator of the nutritional value of most fruits, including apple (Malus domestica). Anthocyanin synthesis is coordinately regulated by light and various phytohormones. In this study on apple, we revealed the antagonistic relationship between light and brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathways, which is mediated by BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (MdBZR1) and the B-box protein MdCOL6. The exogenous application of brassinolide inhibited the high-light-induced anthocyanin accumulation in red-fleshed apple seedlings, whereas increases in the light intensity decreased the endogenous BR content. The overexpression of MdBZR1 inhibited the anthocyanin synthesis in apple plants. An exposure to a high-light intensity induced the degradation of dephosphorylated MdBZR1, resulting in functional impairment. MdBZR1 was identified as an upstream repressor of MdCOL6, which promotes anthocyanin synthesis in apple plants. Furthermore, MdBZR1 interacts with MdCOL6 to attenuate its ability to activate MdUFGT and MdANS transcription. Thus, MdBZR1 negatively regulates MdCOL6-mediated anthocyanin accumulation. Our study findings have clarified the molecular basis of the integration of light and BR signals during the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis, which is an important process influencing fruit quality.
