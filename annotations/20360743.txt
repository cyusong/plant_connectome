['20360743', 'Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is a plant hormone that regulates a broad array of  plant defence and developmental processes. JA-Ile-responsive gene expression is  regulated by the transcriptional activator MYC2 that interacts physically with  the jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) repressor proteins. On perception of JA-Ile, JAZ  proteins are degraded and JA-Ile-dependent gene expression is activated. The  molecular mechanisms by which JAZ proteins repress gene expression remain  unknown. Here we show that the Arabidopsis JAZ proteins recruit the  Groucho/Tup1-type co-repressor TOPLESS (TPL) and TPL-related proteins (TPRs)  through a previously uncharacterized adaptor protein, designated Novel Interactor  of JAZ (NINJA). NINJA acts as a transcriptional repressor whose activity is  mediated by a functional TPL-binding EAR repression motif. Accordingly, both  NINJA and TPL proteins function as negative regulators of jasmonate responses.  Our results point to TPL proteins as general co-repressors that affect multiple  signalling pathways through the interaction with specific adaptor proteins. This  new insight reveals how stress-related and growth-related signalling cascades use  common molecular mechanisms to regulate gene expression in plants.', '2010 Apr 1', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature08854', 'Goossens']
