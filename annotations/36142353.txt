The rapid growth of the global population has resulted in a considerable increase in the demand for food crops. However, traditional crop breeding methods will not be able to satisfy the worldwide demand for food in the future. New gene-editing technologies, the most widely used of which is CRISPR/Cas9, may enable the rapid improvement of crop traits. Specifically, CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology involves the use of a guide RNA and a Cas9 protein that can cleave the genome at specific loci. Due to its simplicity and efficiency, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has rapidly become the most widely used tool for editing animal and plant genomes. It is ideal for modifying the traits of many plants, including food crops, and for creating new germplasm materials. In this review, the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, the underlying mechanism, and examples of its use for editing genes in important crops are discussed. Furthermore, certain limitations of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and potential solutions are described. This article will provide researchers with important information regarding the use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology for crop improvement, plant breeding, and gene functional analyses.
