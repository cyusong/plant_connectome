Plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs) control the initiation, development, and maintenance of symbioses with beneficial mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Carbohydrate perception activates symbiosis signaling via Lysin-motif RLKs and subsequently the common symbiosis signaling pathway. As the receptors activated are often also immune receptors in multiple species, exactly how carbohydrate identities avoid immune activation and drive symbiotic outcome is still not fully understood. This may involve the coincident detection of additional signaling molecules that provide specificity. Because of the metabolic costs of supporting symbionts, the level of symbiosis development is fine-tuned by a range of local and mobile signals that are activated by various RLKs. Beyond early, precontact symbiotic signaling, signal exchanges ensue throughout infection, nutrient exchange, and turnover of symbiosis. Here, we review the latest understanding of plant symbiosis signaling from the perspective of RLK-mediated pathways.
