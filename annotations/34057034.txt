Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the primary auxin in higher plants, and abscisic acid (ABA) play crucial roles in the ability of maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) to acclimatize to various environments by mediating growth, development, defense and nutrient allocation. Although understanding the biochemical reactions for IAA and ABA biosynthesis and signal transduction has progressed, the mechanisms by which auxin and ABA are synthesized and transduced in maize have not been fully elucidated to date. The synthesis and signal transduction pathway of IAA and ABA in maize can be analyzed using an existing model. This article focuses on the research progress toward understanding the synthesis and signaling pathways of IAA and ABA, as well as IAA and ABA regulation of maize growth, providing insight for future development and the significance of IAA and ABA for maize improvement.
