An anthocyanin-producing suspension culture of Daucus carota (L.) cv. Flakkese was used as model system to study secondary metabolite production in cell culture at the individual cell level. An approach was set up in which growth and production of anthocyanins were investigated using a combination of biochemical analysis, image (colour) analysis and in vivo imaging. This novel approach was used to segment the culture in different subpopulations and dissect the productive process in the cell culture grown under two different conditions, known to differ mainly for oxygen supply and mixing intensity (volume of 50 ml or 20 ml in 250 ml flasks). The 20 ml batch cultures gave a higher content and yield of anthocyanins, which depended on a complex balance between events that positively or negatively affected anthocyanin production. A model is proposed in which the different ability of cells to respond to environmental stimuli and stress depends on the different amount of anthocyanins accumulated within cells.

Oxygen supply: !affects! Anthocyanin production
Mixing intensity: !affects! Anthocyanin production
Cell subpopulations: !differ in! Ability to respond to environmental stimuli
Anthocyanins: !accumulate within! Cells
Environmental stimuli: !influence! Anthocyanin production
Stress: !influence! Anthocyanin production
