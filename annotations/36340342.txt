Developing effective and durable host plant resistance is crucial for controlling powdery mildew, a devastating disease caused by <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Bgt</i>). In the present study, we dissected the genetic basis of the adult plant resistance to powdery mildew using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) composed of 176 F<sub>9</sub> RILs population derived from a cross between PuBing 3228 (P3228) and susceptible cultivar Gao 8901. P3228 exhibits stable adult-plant resistance to powdery mildew in the field over consecutive years. We identified two QTLs on chromosomes 7DS (<i>QPm.cas-7D</i>) and 1AL (<i>QPm.cas-1A</i>) contributed by P3228, and one QTL on 3DS (<i>QPm.cas-3D</i>) contributed by Gao 8901, which could explain 65.44%, 3.45%, and 2.18% of the phenotypic variances, respectively. By analyzing the annotated genes in the 1.168 Mb physical interval of the major QTL <i>QPm.cas-7D</i>, we locked a previously cloned adult-plant resistance gene <i>Pm38</i> that was most probably the candidate gene of <i>QPm.cas-7D.</i> Sequence alignment analysis revealed that the candidate gene of <i>QPm.cas-7D</i> in P3228 was identical to the reported <i>Pm38</i> sequence. Two haplotypes <i>QPm-7D-R</i> and <i>QPm-7D-S</i> were identified in the whole <i>Pm38</i> genomic regions between P3228 and Gao 8901. To apply <i>QPm.cas-7D</i> in wheat breeding, we developed a kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) marker <i>Kasp5249</i> that is closely linked with these haplotypes. It is worth mentioning that the <i>QPm-7D-R</i> haplotype significantly decreased TKW and underwent negative selection for higher yields in China wheat breeding. In this study, we identified a major QTL <i>QPm.cas-7D</i> and revealed the relationship between its resistance and yield, which could be beneficial for further applications in wheat disease resistance and high-yield breeding.
