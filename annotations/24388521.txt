['24388521', 'Seed longevity is important to preserve crops and wild plants and it is limited  by progressive cellular damage (aging) during storage. The induction of cellular  stress defenses and the formation of the seed coat are crucial protecting events  during seed development, a process mediated in Arabidopsis thaliana by the  transcription factors LEC1, LEC2, FUS3 and the abscisic acid-activated ABI3. In  order to identify novel determinants of seed longevity we have screened an  activation-tagging mutant collection of Arabidopsis and isolated a dominant  mutant with increased seed longevity under both natural and accelerated aging  conditions. Molecular characterization indicates that the mutant phenotype is  caused by over-expression of the At2g26130 gene encoding a RING-type zinc finger  putative ubiquitin ligase. Loss of function of this gene in a T-DNA insertion  mutant resulted in decreased seed longevity. We named this important gene for  seed longevity RSL1 (from Ring finger of Seed Longevity1) and we could  demonstrate ubiquitin ligase activity with the recombinant protein. Morphological  alterations in shoot tissues of the RSL1 over-expressing plants and analysis of  gibberellins levels suggest that RSL1 may increase gibberellins responses by some  unknown mechanism. These results validate the forward genetic approach to seed  longevity and anticipate the identification of many novel determinants of this  important trait.', '2014 Feb', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2013.11.004', 'Serrano']
