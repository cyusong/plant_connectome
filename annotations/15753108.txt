['15753108', 'MICROTUBULE ORGANIZATION 1 encodes a microtubule-associated protein in  Arabidopsis thaliana but different alleles have contradictory phenotypes. The  original mutant mor1 alleles were reported to have disrupted cortical  microtubules, swollen organs and normal cytokinesis, whereas other alleles,  embryo-lethal gemini pollen 1 (gem1), have defective pollen cytokinesis. To  determine whether MOR1 functions generally in cytokinesis, we examined the  ultrastructure of cell division in roots of the original mor1-1 allele. Cell  plates are misaligned, branched and meandering; the forming cell plates remain  partly vesicular, with electron-dense or lamellar content. Phragmoplast  microtubules are abundant but organized aberrantly. Thus, MOR1 functions in both  phragmoplast and cortical arrays.', '2005 Apr', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pci068', 'Hepler']
