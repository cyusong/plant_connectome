In Nicotiana tabacum, the degeneration of connective tissue and stomium tissue (the stomium and circular cell cluster [CCC]) is essential for anther dehiscence. Both connective cells and CCC cells are crystal idioblasts, and these cells will undergo degeneration after accumulating calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals. However, detailed data concerning this process are minimal. Therefore, this study used cellular biological and physiological methods to illustrate this relationship. Results demonstrated that tobacco anther dehiscence is a series of timed programmed cell death (PCD) processes that include the CCC, connective tissue, and stomium. The degenerating crystal idioblasts of the tobacco anther were found to possess two hallmark characteristics that distinguished them from normal PCD cells, namely dynamic changes in CaOx crystals and the appearance of numerous peroxisomes. The accumulation of CaOx and the production of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> occurred simultaneously or successively before PCD. The peak H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> content was found to appear after the insoluble oxalate. Further, CeCl<sub>3</sub> cytochemistry staining was used to detect subcellular H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> , and the precipitate of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> was primarily present in peroxisomes and around CaOx crystals. These results show that anther dehiscence in N. tabacum is a PCD process in which crystal idioblasts play a vital role in CaOx degradation and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> production.
