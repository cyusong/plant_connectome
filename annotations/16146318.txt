Polyamine concentrations were determined in leaves and roots of tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L.) subjected to a short-term boron deficiency. A decrease in the growth of shoots and, especially, roots was found under this mineral deficiency. Boron deficiency did not lead to a significant decrease in leaf or root ion concentrations when compared to control treatment; however, as expected, leaf boron concentration was lower in boron-deficient plants in comparison to the control. In leaves, the levels of free putrescine and spermidine were similar in both treatments. In roots, a short-term boron deficiency caused an increase in free putrescine. Moreover, boron-deficient plants had higher conjugated polyamine concentration than boron-sufficient plants, which was especially evident for conjugated putrescine in leaves. A possible link between boron and polyamine levels is proposed and discussed.

Boron deficiency: !decreases! Growth 
Boron deficiency: !lowers! Leaf boron concentration 
Boron deficiency: !increases! Free putrescine in roots 
Boron deficiency: !increases! Conjugated polyamine concentration in leaves
