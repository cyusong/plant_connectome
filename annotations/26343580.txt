['26343580', "Abiotic stress, such as salinity, drought, and cold, causes detrimental yield  losses for all major plant crop species. Understanding mechanisms that improve  plants' ability to produce biomass, which largely is constituted by the plant  cell wall, is therefore of upmost importance for agricultural activities.  Cellulose is a principal component of the cell wall and is synthesized by  microtubule-guided cellulose synthase enzymes at the plasma membrane. Here, we  identified two components of the cellulose synthase complex, which we call  companion of cellulose synthase (CC) proteins. The cytoplasmic tails of these  membrane proteins bind to microtubules and promote microtubule dynamics. This  activity supports microtubule organization, cellulose synthase localization at  the plasma membrane, and renders seedlings less sensitive to stress. Our findings  offer a mechanistic model for how two molecular components, the CC proteins,  sustain microtubule organization and cellulose synthase localization and thus aid  plant biomass production during salt stress.
