S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide moiety to a cysteine thiol, is now established as a key post-translational modification in animals. This process has been shown to regulate the function of a wide variety of regulatory, structural, and metabolic proteins. The emerging evidence now suggests that S-nitrosylation may also have a central function in plant biology.
