Plant roots show growth cessation as a primary response to mechanical stress. To clarify the molecular basis of this response, we have previously established an assay system to monitor the root growth response of Arabidopsis seedlings to mechanical stimuli using dialysis membrane-covered agar media. Here we examined the effect of plant hormones and their related molecules on this response. Amino-cyclopropane carboxylate, a precursor of ethylene, remarkably enhanced the growth reduction while silver ions, which block ethylene perception, nullified the response. Furthermore, salicylic acid, which inhibits ethylene biosynthesis, alleviated the root growth reduction, whereas methyl jasmonate had no apparent effect on the response. These results suggest that the root-growth cessation observed in response to mechanical stress involves ethylene signaling; however, this response may be independent from the pathway that integrates signals from ethylene and jasmonate.
