Cutinsomes, spherical nanoparticles containing cutin mono- and oligomers, are engaged in cuticle formation. Earlier they were revealed to participate in cuticle biosynthesis in Solanum lycopersicum fruit and Ornithogalum umbellatum ovary epidermis. Here, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunogold labeling with antibody against the cutinsomes were applied to aerial cotyledon epidermal cells of Arabidopsis thaliana mature embryos. TEM as well as gold particles conjugated with the cutinsome antibody revealed these structures in the cytoplasm, near the plasmalemma, in the cell wall and incorporated into the cuticle. Thus, the cutinsomes most probably are involved in the formation of A. thaliana embryo cuticle and this model plant is another species in which these specific structures participate in the building of cuticle in spite of the lack of the lipotubuloid metabolon. In addition, a mechanism of plant cuticle lipid biosynthesis based on current knowledge is proposed.
