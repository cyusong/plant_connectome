Laticifer cells are specialized plant cells that synthesize and accumulate latex. Studies on laticifers have lagged behind in recent years, and data regarding the functional role of laticifers and their fitness benefit still remain elusive. Laticifer differentiation and its impact on plant growth and development also remain to be investigated. Here, cellular, molecular, and genetic tools were developed to examine the distribution, differentiation, ontogeny, and other characteristic features, as well as the potential developmental role of laticifer cells in the latex-bearing plant Euphorbia lathyris. The organization of the laticiferous system within the E. lathyris plant body is reported, emerging as a single elongated and branched coenocytic cell, constituting the largest cell type existing in plants. We also report the ontogeny and organization of laticifer cells in the embryo and the identification of a laticifer-associated gene expression pattern. Moreover, the identification of laticifer- and latex-deficient mutants (pil mutants) allowed for the identification of distinct loci regulating laticifer differentiation, growth, and metabolic activity. Additionally, pil mutants revealed that laticifer cells appear nonessential for plant growth and development, thus pointing toward their importance, instead, for specific ecophysiological adaptations of latex-bearing plants in natural environments.
