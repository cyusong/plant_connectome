The genus <i>Brassica</i> comprises a highly diverse range of vegetable crops varying in morphology, harvestable crop product, and postharvest shelf-life that has arisen through domestication, artificial selection and plant breeding. Previous postharvest studies on the shelf-life of <i>Brassica</i> species has mainly focused on the variable rates of physiological changes including respiration and transpiration. Therefore, further understanding of the molecular basis of postharvest senescence in <i>Brassica</i> vegetables is needed to understand its progression in improving their postharvest shelf-life. The aim of this study was to better understand the trajectory of molecular responses in senescence-associated genes but not induced by ethylene and ethylene-induced genes towards altered postharvest storage conditions. After storage at different temperatures, the expression levels of the key senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and the ethylene biosynthesis, perception, and signaling genes were quantitatively analyzed in cabbage, broccoli and kale. The expression levels of these genes were tightly linked to storage temperature and phase of senescence. Expression of <i>ORE15</i>, <i>SAG12,</i> and <i>NAC29</i> were continuously increased during the twelve days of postharvest storage at room temperature. Prolonged exposure of these three vegetables to cold temperature reduced the variation in the expression levels of <i>ORE15</i> and <i>SAG12</i>, observed as mostly decreased which resulted in limiting senescence. The transcript levels of the ethylene receptor were also decreased at lower temperature, further suggesting that decreased ethylene biosynthesis and signaling in cabbage during postharvest storage would delay the senescence mechanism. These results enhanced our understanding of the transcriptional changes in ethylene-independent SAGs and ethylene-related genes in postharvest senescence, as well as the timing and temperature sensitive molecular events associated with senescence in cabbage, broccoli and kale and this knowledge can potentially be used for the improvement of postharvest storage in <i>Brassica</i> vegetables.
