Plant endoparasitic nematodes induce the formation of their feeding cells by injecting effectors from the esophageal glands into root cells. Although vascular cylinder cells seem to be involved in the formation of root-knot nematode (RKN) feeding structures, molecular evidence is scarce. We address the role during gall development of LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN 16 (LBD16), a key component of the auxin pathway leading to the divisions in the xylem pole pericycle (XPP) for lateral root (LR) formation. Arabidopsis T-DNA tagged J0192 and J0121 XPP marker lines, LBD16 and DR5::GUS promoter lines, and isolated J0192 protoplasts were assayed for nematode-dependent gene expression. Infection tests in LBD16 knock-out lines were used for functional analysis. J0192 and J0121 lines were activated in early developing galls and giant cells (GCs), resembling the pattern of the G2/M-transition specific ProC yc B 1;1 :CycB1;1(NT)-GUS line. LBD16 was regulated by auxins in galls as in LRs, and induced by RKN secretions. LBD16 loss of function mutants and a transgenic line with defective XPP cells showed a significantly reduced infection rate. The results show that genes expressed in the dividing XPP, particularly LBD16, are important for gall formation, as they are for LR development.
