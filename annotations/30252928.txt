Plants can improve their antiherbivore defence by taking insect egg deposition as cue of impending feeding damage. Previous studies showed that Pieris brassicae larvae feeding upon egg-deposited Brassicaceae perform worse and gain less weight than larvae on egg-free plants. We investigated how P. brassicae oviposition on Arabidopsis thaliana affects the plant's molecular and chemical responses to larvae. A transcriptome comparison of feeding-damaged leaves without and with prior oviposition revealed about 200 differently expressed genes, including enhanced expression of PR5, which is involved in salicylic acid (SA)-signalling. SA levels were induced by larval feeding to a slightly greater extent in egg-deposited than egg-free plants. The adverse effect of egg-deposited wild-type (WT) plants on larval weight was absent in an egg-deposited PR5-deficient mutant or other mutants impaired in SA-mediated signalling, that is, sid2/ics1, ald1, and pad4. In contrast, the adverse effect of egg-deposited WT plants on larvae was retained in egg-deposited npr1 and wrky70 mutants impaired further downstream in SA-signalling. Oviposition induced accumulation of flavonols in WT plants with and without feeding damage, but not in the PR5-deficient mutant. We demonstrated that egg-mediated improvement of A. thaliana's antiherbivore defence involves SA-signalling in an NPR1-independent manner and is associated with accumulation of flavonols.
