The exploitation of diverse natural variation has been a key progenitor of crop breeding over the last decade. However, commercial practice is now turning to the use of accessions with less extreme phenotypes as genetic donors. In the present study, the carotenoid formation in a red-fruited discovery panel of Capsicum annuum (chilli pepper) has been characterized. The data indicated that colour intensity correlated with the amount of capsanthin and its esters, along with transcript levels of the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and phytoene synthase-1 (PSY-1) genes. Quantification of carotenoids through development and ripening suggested the presence of separate biosynthesis and accumulation phases. Subplastid fractionation demonstrated the differential sequestration of pigments in high- and low-intensity lines and revealed the PSY protein to be most active in the membrane fractions when abundance was highest in the fibril fractions. Carotenoid accumulation was associated with the esterification of xanthophylls, expression of a putative carotenoid acyl transferase, and increased fibril content within the plastid. Interrogation of TEM images and carotenoid analysis of subplastid fractions suggest that the plastoglobuli are likely to be the progenitor of the characteristic fibrils found in pepper fruit. Collectively, these data provide an insight into the underpinning molecular, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms associated with the synthesis and sequestration of carotenoids in chromoplast-containing fruits, in addition to providing potential tools and resources for the breeding of high red colour intensity pepper varieties.
