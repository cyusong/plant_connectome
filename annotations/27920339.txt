['27920339', 'Chlorophyll turns over in green organs during photosystem repair and is salvaged  via de- and rephytylation, but the enzyme involved in dephytylation is unknown.  We have identified an Arabidopsis thaliana thylakoid protein with a putative  hydrolase domain that can dephytylate chlorophyll in vitro and in vivo. The  corresponding locus, CHLOROPHYLL DEPHYTYLASE1 (CLD1), was identified by mapping a  semidominant, heat-sensitive, missense allele (cld1-1). CLD1 is conserved in  oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, sharing structural similarity with  pheophytinase, which functions in chlorophyll breakdown during leaf senescence.  Unlike pheophytinase, CLD1 is predominantly expressed in green organs and can  dephytylate chlorophyll in vitro. The specific activity is significantly higher  for the mutant protein encoded by cld1-1 than the wild-type enzyme, consistent  with the semidominant nature of the cld1-1 mutation. Supraoptimal CLD1 activities  in cld1-1 mutants and transgenic seedlings led to the proportional accumulation  of chlorophyllides derived from chlorophyll dephytylation after heat shock, which  resulted in light-dependent cotyledon bleaching. Reducing CLD1 expression  diminished thermotolerance and the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II  under prolonged moderate heat stress. Taken together, our results suggest that  CLD1 is the long-sought enzyme for removing the phytol chain from chlorophyll  during its turnover at steady state within the chloroplast.', '2016 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00478', 'ORCID:']
