Salicylic acid (SA) plays an important role in various aspects of plant development and responses to stresses. To elucidate the sophisticated regulatory mechanism of SA synthesis and signaling, we used a yeast one-hybrid system to screen for regulators of isochorismate synthase 1 (ICS1), a gene encoding the key enzyme in SA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. A TCP family transcription factor AtTCP8 was initially identified as a candidate regulator of ICS1. The regulation of ICS1 by TCP proteins is supported by the presence of a typical TCP binding site in the ICS1 promoter. The binding of TCP8 to this site was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo assays. Expression patterns of TCP8 and its corresponding gene TCP9 largely overlapped with ICS1 under pathogen attack. A significant reduction in the expression of ICS1 during immune responses was observed in the tcp8 tcp9 double mutant. We also detected strong interactions between TCP8 and SAR deficient 1 (SARD1), WRKY family transcription factor 28 (WRKY28), NAC (NAM/ATAF1,ATAF2/CUC2) family transcription factor 019 (NAC019), as well as among TCP8, TCP9 and TCP20, suggesting a complex coordinated regulatory mechanism underlying ICS1 expression. Our results collectively demonstrate that TCP proteins are involved in the orchestrated regulation of ICS1 expression, with TCP8 and TCP9 being verified as major representatives.
