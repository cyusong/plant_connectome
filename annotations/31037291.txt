The plant body plan and primary organs are established during embryogenesis. However, in contrast to animals, plants have the ability to generate new organs throughout their whole life. These give them an extraordinary developmental plasticity to modulate their size and architecture according to environmental constraints and opportunities. How this plasticity is regulated at the whole-organism level is elusive. Here we provide evidence for a role for translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) in regulating the iterative formation of lateral roots in Arabidopsis. AtTCTP1 modulates root system architecture through a dual function: as a general constitutive growth promoter enhancing root elongation and as a systemic signalling agent via mobility in the vasculature. AtTCTP1 encodes mRNAs with long-distance mobility between the shoot and roots. Mobile shoot-derived TCTP1 gene products act specifically to enhance the frequency of lateral root initiation and emergence sites along the primary root pericycle, while root elongation is controlled by local constitutive TCTP1 expression and scion size. These findings uncover a novel type for an integrative signal in the control of lateral root initiation and the compromise for roots between branching more profusely or elongating further. They also provide the first evidence in plants of an extracellular function of the vital, highly expressed ubiquitous TCTP1.
