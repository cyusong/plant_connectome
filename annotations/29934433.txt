Malate dehydrogenases (MDHs) convert malate to oxaloacetate using NAD(H) or NADP(H) as a cofactor. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants lacking plastidial NAD-dependent MDH (<i>pdnad-mdh</i>) are embryo-lethal, and constitutive silencing (<i>miR-mdh-</i>1) causes a pale, dwarfed phenotype. The reason for these severe phenotypes is unknown. Here, we rescued the embryo lethality of <i>pdnad-mdh</i> via embryo-specific expression of pdNAD-MDH. Rescued seedlings developed white leaves with aberrant chloroplasts and failed to reproduce. Inducible silencing of pdNAD-MDH at the rosette stage also resulted in white newly emerging leaves. These data suggest that pdNAD-MDH is important for early plastid development, which is consistent with the reductions in major plastidial galactolipid, carotenoid, and protochlorophyllide levels in <i>miR-mdh-</i>1 seedlings. Surprisingly, the targeting of other NAD-dependent MDH isoforms to the plastid did not complement the embryo lethality of <i>pdnad-mdh</i>, while expression of enzymatically inactive pdNAD-MDH did. These complemented plants grew indistinguishably from the wild type. Both active and inactive forms of pdNAD-MDH interact with a heteromeric AAA-ATPase complex at the inner membrane of the chloroplast envelope. Silencing the expression of FtsH12, a key member of this complex, resulted in a phenotype that strongly resembles <i>miR-mdh-</i>1. We propose that pdNAD-MDH is essential for chloroplast development due to its moonlighting role in stabilizing FtsH12, distinct from its enzymatic function.
