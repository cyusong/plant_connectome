['19228119', 'PEPC [PEP(phosphoenolpyruvate) carboxylase] is a tightly controlled cytosolic  enzyme situated at a major branchpoint in plant metabolism. Accumulating evidence  indicates important functions for PEPC and PPCK (PEPC kinase) in plant  acclimation to nutritional P(i) deprivation. However, little is known about the  genetic origin or phosphorylation status of native PEPCs from -P(i)  (P(i)-deficient) plants. The transfer of Arabidopsis suspension cells or  seedlings to -P(i) growth media resulted in: (i) the marked transcriptional  upregulation of genes encoding the PEPC isoenzyme AtPPC1 (Arabidopsis thaliana  PEPC1), and PPCK isoenzymes AtPPCK1 and AtPPCK2; (ii) >2-fold increases in PEPC  specific activity and in the amount of an immunoreactive 107-kDa PEPC polypeptide  (p107); and (iii) In vivo p107 phosphorylation as revealed by immunoblotting of  clarified extracts with phosphosite-specific antibodies to Ser-11 (which could be  reversed following P(i) resupply). Approx. 1.3 mg of PEPC was purified 660-fold  from -P(i) suspension cells to apparent homogeneity with a specific activity of  22.3 units x mg(-1) of protein. Gel filtration, SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting  demonstrated that purified PEPC exists as a 440-kDa homotetramer composed of  identical p107 subunits. Sequencing of p107 tryptic and Asp-N peptides by tandem  MS established that this PEPC is encoded by AtPPC1. P(i)-affinity PAGE coupled  with immunoblotting indicated stoichiometric phosphorylation of the p107 subunits  of AtPPC1 at its conserved Ser-11 phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation activated  AtPPC1 at pH 7.3 by lowering its Km(PEP) and its sensitivity to inhibition by  L-malate and L-aspartate, while enhancing activation by glucose 6-phosphate. Our  results indicate that the simultaneous induction and In vivo phosphorylation  activation of AtPPC1 contribute to the metabolic adaptations of -P(i)  Arabidopsis.', '2009 Apr 28', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/BJ20082397', 'Plaxton']
