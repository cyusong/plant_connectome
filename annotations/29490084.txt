The mechanisms that control polyamine (PA) metabolism in plant cell lines with different embryogenic potential are not well understood. This study involved the use of two Araucaria angustifolia cell lines, one of which was defined as being blocked, in that the cells were incapable of developing somatic embryos, and the other as being responsive, as the cells could generate somatic embryos. Cellular PA metabolism was modulated by using 5 mM arginine (Arg) or ornithine (Orn) at two time points during cell growth. Two days after subculturing with Arg, an increase in citrulline (Cit) content was observed, followed by a higher expression of genes related to PA catabolism in the responsive cell line; whereas, in the blocked cell line, we only observed an accumulation of PAs. After 14 d, metabolism was directed towards putrescine accumulation in both cell lines. Exogenous Arg and Orn not only caused a change in cellular contents of PAs, but also altered the abundance of a broader spectrum of amino acids. Specifically, Cit was the predominant amino acid. We also noted changes in the expression of genes related to PA biosynthesis and catabolism. These results indicate that Arg and Orn act as regulators of both biosynthetic and catabolic PA metabolites; however, we suggest that they have distinct roles associated with embryogenic potential of the cells.

arginine: !modulates! PA metabolism 
ornithine: !modulates! PA metabolism 
responsive cell line: !accumulates! Cit 
blocked cell line: !accumulates! PAs 
exogenous Arg/Orn: !alters! abundance of amino acids 
Arg/Orn: !regulate! biosynthetic/catabolic PA metabolites
