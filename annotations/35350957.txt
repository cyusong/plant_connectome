Disruption of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 (hereafter designated as MEKK1 pathway), leads to the activation of distinct NLRs (nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptors), TNL (TIR-type NLR) SMN1, and CNL (CC-type NLR) SUMM2, resulting in dwarf and autoimmune phenotypes. Unlike <i>mekk1</i> and <i>mkk1mkk2</i> mutants, the dwarf and autoimmune phenotypes of <i>mpk4</i> are only partially suppressed by the <i>summ2</i> mutation, suggesting a significant contribution of <i>SMN1</i> to the <i>mpk4</i> phenotypes. However, full suppression of <i>mpk4</i> by the <i>smn1summ2</i> double mutation remains to be elucidated. To address this key question, we generated a <i>mpk4smn1summ2</i> triple mutant and analyzed the dwarf and constitutive cell death phenotypes. The <i>mpk4smn1summ2</i> triple mutant showed restoration of plant size with no detectable cell death, indicating full suppression of the dwarf and autoimmune phenotypes. These results suggest that SMN1 and SUMM2 constitute a robust surveillance system for the MEKK1 pathway against pathogen infection.
