['15723040', 'The components and pathways that regulate and execute developmental cell death  programmes in plants remain largely unknown. We have found that the PROMOTION OF  CELL SURVIVAL 1 (PCS1) gene in Arabidopsis, which encodes an aspartic protease,  has an important role in determining the fate of cells in embryonic development  and in reproduction processes. The loss-of-function mutation of PCS1 causes  degeneration of both male and female gametophytes and excessive cell death of  developing embryos. Conversely, ectopic expression of PCS1 causes the septum and  stomium cells that normally die in the anther wall to survive instead, leading to  a failure in anther dehiscence and male sterility. PCS1 provides a new avenue for  understanding the mechanisms of the programmed cell death processes that are  associated with developmental pathways in plants and makes available a useful  tool for engineering the male sterility trait for hybrid seed production.', '2005 Mar', 'EMBO Rep', '10.1038/sj.embor.7400357', 'Xia']
