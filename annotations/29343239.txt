Soil salinization is one of the major environmental constraints to plant growth and agricultural production worldwide. Signaling components involving calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and the downstream calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) play key roles in the perception and transduction of stress signals. However, the study of CPKs in cotton and their functions in response to salt stress remain unexplored. A total of 98 predicted CPKs were identified from upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. 'TM-1'), and phylogenetic analyses classified them into four groups. Gene family distribution studies have revealed the substantial impacts of the genome duplication events to the total number of GhCPKs. Transcriptome analyses showed a wide distribution of CPKs' expression among different organs. A total of 19 CPKs were selected for their rapid responses to salt stress at the transcriptional level, most of which were also incduced by the thylene-releasing chemical ethephon, suggesting a partal overlap of the salinity and ethylene responses. Silencing of 4 of the 19 CPKs (GhCPK8, GhCPK38, GhCPK54, and GhCPK55) severely compromised the basal cotton resistance to salt stress. Our genome-wide expression analysis of CPK genes from up-land cotton suggests that CPKs are involved in multiple developmental responses as well as the response to different abiotic stresses. A cluster of the cotton CPKs was shown to participate in the early signaling events in cotton responses to salt stress. Our results provide significant insights on functional analysis of CPKs in cotton, especially in the context of cotton adaptions to salt stress.
