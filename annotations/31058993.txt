Lateral root (LR) formation and development play a vital role in plant development by permitting the establishment of branched root systems. It is well known that nutrient availability controls LR development. Moreover, LR development is fine-tuned by a myriad of hormonal signals. Many transcription factors (TFs) participate in LR development. Here, we discuss the TFs involved in the nitrate and auxin signaling pathways and how these function in the regulation of LR formation and development in chrysanthemum. AtTCP20 is a plant-specific TF, which can modulate LR development in response to nitrate. The roles of CmTCP20 in LR development were identified by overexpression in chrysanthemum and heterologous expression in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of CmTCP20 significantly increased the number and average length of LRs compared with the wild type in chrysanthemum and Arabidopsis. We also found that CmTCP20 positively influenced auxin accumulation in the LRs at least partly by improving auxin biosynthesis, transport and response, thereby promoting LR development. Moreover, we found that CmTCP20 interacts with an auxin response factor, CmARF8, which also can be induced by nitrate and combined to proximal sites in the upstream promoter region of CmCYCB1;1 to positively regulate the cell cycle. The CmTCP20-CmARF8 heterodimer links nitrate and auxin signaling and converts cell-cycle signals to regulate LR initiation and growth.
