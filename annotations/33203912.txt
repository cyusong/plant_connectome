['33203912', 'The identification and functional characterization of natural variants in plants  are essential for understanding phenotypic adaptation. Here we identify a  molecular variation in At2g47310 that contributes to the natural variation in  flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. This gene, which we term  SISTER of FCA (SSF), functions in an antagonistic manner to its close homolog  FCA. Genome-wide association analysis screens two major haplotypes of SSF  associated with the natural variation in FLC expression, and a single  polymorphism, SSF-N414D, is identified as a main contributor. The SSF414N protein  variant interacts more strongly with CUL1, a component of the E3 ubiquitination  complex, than the SSF414D form, mediating differences in SSF protein degradation  and FLC expression. FCA and SSF appear to have arisen through gene duplication  after dicot-monocot divergence, with the SSF-N414D polymorphism emerging  relatively recently within A. thaliana. This work provides a good example for  deciphering the functional importance of natural polymorphisms in different  organisms.', '2020 Nov 17', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-020-19666-0', 'ORCID:']
