This study provides a comparative account of the effects of cadmium, temperature, ultraviolet-B and sodium chloride on the growth, photosynthesis, nutrient uptake and enzyme activities of untreated control and copper-acclimated Anabaena doliolum. Reduction in all the studied parameters, except carotenoids, was maximum for sodium chloride followed by ultraviolet-B, temperature and cadmium treatments, the reduction being greater in control than acclimated A. doliolum. Among the various parameters, photosystem II was most sensitive for all the stresses in both control and acclimated A. doliolum. Likewise, O2 evolution was more susceptible to various stressors than 14C uptake. Ammonium uptake and glutamine synthetase (GS, EC 6.3.1.2) were the least affected parameters. As compared to control, acclimated Anabaena exhibited higher ATP content under normal conditions. These results attest our hypotheses that acclimated Anabaena was physiologically more robust than control and that salinity was more injurious to the test organism than other abiotic stresses investigated.
