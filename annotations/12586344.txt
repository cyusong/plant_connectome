['12586344', 'We report molecular characterization of an Arabidopsis gene encoding a  mitochondrial FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (FAD-GPDH) that  oxidizes glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. We  demonstrate through in vitro targeting assays that the encoded gene product can  be imported into mitochondrial membrane systems. Enzyme activity of the protein  was confirmed through heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. The  Arabidopsis gene is expressed throughout plant development, but at the highest  level during seed germination. We also show that expression of the Arabidopsis  FAD-GPDH gene is coupled to oxygen consumption and affected by ABA and stress  conditions. Together with an NAD(+)-dependent GPDH, this enzyme could form a  G-3-P shuttle, as previously established in other eukaryotic organisms, and links  cytosolic G-3-P metabolism to carbon source utilization and energy metabolism in  plants.', '2003 Feb 11', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(03)00033-4', 'Zou']
