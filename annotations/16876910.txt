A fragment encoding a partial sequence of a prohibitin (Phb) gene was isolated. The expression of Phb mRNA and protein in seeds of wild type and mutant Arabidopsis thaliana is presented. Phb mRNA is abundant in wild-type seeds; thus, it may have sequence or structural characteristics responsible for this stability. The 3' untranslated region sequence of a Phb gene has interesting features. We found that Arabidopsis Phb does not interact with a retinoblastoma-related protein or E2F in a yeast two-hybrid system, thus suggesting that the plant protein may have not conserved such interaction, described for mammalian Phb. The possible role of Phb in cell cycle regulation during germination is discussed.
