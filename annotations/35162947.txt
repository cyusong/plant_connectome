Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is regarded as a "New Warrior" for managing plant stress. It also plays an important role in plant growth and development. The regulation of root system architecture (RSA) by H<sub>2</sub>S has been widely recognized. Plants are dependent on the RSA to meet their water and nutritional requirements. They are also partially dependent on the RSA for adapting to environment change. Therefore, a good understanding of how H<sub>2</sub>S affects the RSA could lead to improvements in both crop function and resistance to environmental change. In this review, we summarized the regulating effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on the RSA in terms of primary root growth, lateral and adventitious root formation, root hair development, and the formation of nodules. We also discussed the genes involved in the regulation of the RSA by H<sub>2</sub>S, and the relationships with other signal pathways. In addition, we discussed how H<sub>2</sub>S regulates root growth in response to abiotic stress. This review could provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of H<sub>2</sub>S in roots during development and under abiotic stress.
