['9733529', 'During oil deposition in developing seeds of Arabidopsis, photosynthate is  imported in the form of carbohydrates into the embryo and converted to  triacylglycerols. To identify genes essential for this process and to investigate  the molecular basis for the developmental regulation of oil accumulation, mutants  producing wrinkled, incompletely filled seeds were isolated. A novel mutant  locus, wrinkled1 (wri1), which maps to the bottom of chromosome 3 and causes an  80% reduction in seed oil content, was identified. Wild-type and homozygous wri1  mutant plantlets or mature plants were indistinguishable. However, developing  homozygous wri1 seeds were impaired in the incorporation of sucrose and glucose  into triacylglycerols, but incorporated pyruvate and acetate at an increased  rate. Because the activities of several glycolytic enzymes, in particular  hexokinase and pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, are reduced in  developing homozygous wri1 seeds, it is suggested that WRI1 is involved in the  developmental regulation of carbohydrate metabolism during seed filling.', '1998 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.118.1.91', 'Benning']
