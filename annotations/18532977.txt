['18532977', 'In Arabidopsis, MYB transcription factors regulate flavonoid biosynthesis via the  formation of protein complexes with a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription  factor and a WD40 repeat protein. Several R3-type single-MYB proteins (R3-MYB),  such as CPC and TRY, act as negative regulators of the development of epidermal  cells. However, such regulators of flavonoid biosynthesis have not yet been  reported, to our knowledge. We show here that an R3-MYB protein, AtMYBL2, acts as  a transcriptional repressor and negatively regulates the biosynthesis of  anthocyanin in Arabidopsis. In an AtMYBL2 knockout line (mybl2), the expression  of the DFR and TT8 genes was enhanced and resulted in the ectopic accumulation of  anthocyanin, while ectopic expression of AtMYBL2 or of a chimeric repressor that  is a dominant negative form of AtMYBL2 suppressed the expression of DFR and TT8,  and the biosynthesis of anthocyanin. The expression of AtMYBL2 was detected in  various tissues but not in those in which anthocyanin accumulated or TT8 was  expressed. The minimal repression domain of AtMYBL2 was found to be the six amino  acids (TLLLFR) at the carboxyl terminus, and TLLLFR appears to be a novel  repression motif that is different from the ERF-associated amphiphilic repression  (EAR) motif. The defective phenotype of mybl2 mutants was complemented by  35S:AtMYBL2 but enhanced by a truncated form of AtMYBL2 from which the repression  domain had been deleted. AtMYBL2 bound directly to TT8 protein and this complex  suppressed the expression of DFR and TT8. The repression activity of AtMYBL2  appears to play a critical role in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis.', '2008 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03565.x', 'Ohme-Takagi']
