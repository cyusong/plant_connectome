['19070688', 'DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most cytotoxic forms of DNA damage  and must be repaired by recombination, predominantly via non-homologous joining  of DNA ends (NHEJ) in higher eukaryotes. However, analysis of DSB repair kinetics  of plant NHEJ mutants atlig4-4 and atku80 with the neutral comet assay shows that  alternative DSB repair pathways are active. Surprisingly, these kinetic  measurements show that DSB repair was faster in the NHEJ mutant lines than in  wild-type Arabidopsis. Here we provide the first characterization of this  KU-independent, rapid DSB repair pathway operating in Arabidopsis. The alternate  pathway that rapidly removes the majority of DSBs present in nuclear DNA depends  upon structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complex proteins, namely  MIM/AtRAD18 and AtRAD21.1. An absolute requirement for SMC proteins and kleisin  for rapid repair of DSBs in Arabidopsis opens new insight into the mechanism of  DSB removal in plants.', '2009 Mar 1', 'DNA Repair (Amst)', '10.1016/j.dnarep.2008.11.012', 'Angelis']
