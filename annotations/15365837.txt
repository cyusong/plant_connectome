The aim of the present study was to determine early cyto-histological events associated with the reduced number of shoots formed at the end of culture in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) thin cell layers treated with methyl jasmonate (MJ) [S. Biondi et al. (2001) J Exp Bot 52:1-12]. The results show that 0.1-10 microM MJ strongly stimulated mitotic activity early in culture relative to untreated controls. Treatment with MJ also induced anomalous mitoses. Enhanced proliferative growth was confirmed by northern analysis and in situ hybridisation using cDNA probes of the G1/S phase-specific genes ubiquitin carboxyl-extension protein (ubi-CEP), topoisomerase 1 (top1) and ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). The formation of meristematic cell clusters on day 5 was also enhanced by 1 muM MJ, but subsequent development of these cell clusters into meristemoids and shoot primordia was reduced by all MJ concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Cell expansion was stimulated by MJ concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 10 microM; expanded cells frequently occurred around and within meristemoids and shoot primordia, and displayed thickened and suberised cell walls; cell wall thickness increased with increasing MJ concentration. These cytological events caused alterations in the tunica and stem differentiation of the shoot dome. The apparently paradoxical role of MJ, which deregulates shoot formation through a stimulation of growth events, i.e., mitotic activity and cell expansion, is discussed.
