<i>Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1</i>/<i>Tryptophan Aminotransferase</i>-Related (<i>TAA1</i>/<i>TAR</i>) proteins are the enzymes that involved in auxin biosynthesis pathway. The <i>TAA1</i>/<i>TAR</i> gene family has been systematically characterized in several plants but has not been well reported in <i>Brassica napus</i>. In the present study, a total of 102 <i>BnTAR</i> genes with different number of introns were identified. It was revealed that these genes are distributed unevenly and occurred as clusters on different chromosomes except for A4, A5, A10 and C4 in <i>B. napus</i>. Most of the these <i>BnTAR</i> genes are conserved despite of existing of gene loss and gene gain. In addition, the segmental replication and whole-genome replication events were both play an important role in the <i>BnTAR</i> gene family formation. Expression profiles analysis indicated that the expression of <i>BnTAR</i> gene showed two patterns, part of them were mainly expressed in roots, stems and leaves of vegetative organs, and the others were mainly expressed in flowers and seeds of reproductive organs. Further analysis showed that many of <i>BnTAR</i> genes were located in QTL intervals of oil content or seed weight, for example <i>BnAMI10</i> was located in <i>cqOC-C5-4</i> and <i>cqSW-A2-2</i>, it indicated that some of the <i>BnTAR</i> genes might have relationship with these two characteristics. This study provides a multidimensional analysis of the <i>TAA1/TAR</i> gene family and a new insight into its biological function in <i>B. napus</i>.
