Atriplex halimus L. is a C4 xero-halophyte species well adapted to salt and drought conditions. To collect information on the physiological impact of low salt levels on their water-stress resistance, seedlings were exposed for 6 d to nutrient solution containing either 0% or 15% polyethylene glycol 10,000 (PEG), in the presence or in the absence of 50 mM NaCl. Similar experiments were performed with one PEG-resistant and one PEG-sensitive selected cell line exposed for 50 d to 0% or 15% PEG on standard Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) medium, on LS medium supplemented with 50 mM NaCl, or on Na+-free medium. NaCl mitigated the deleterious impact of PEG on growth of both whole plants and PEG-sensitive cell lines and improved the ability of stressed tissues to perform osmotic adjustment (OA). Water stress reduced CO2 net assimilation rates quantified in the presence of high CO2 and low O2 levels (A), stomatal conductance and transpiration, but NaCl improved water use efficiency of PEG-treated plants through its positive effect on A values, especially in young leaves. PEG increased the internal Na+ concentration. The resistant cell line accumulated higher concentration of Na+ than the PEG-sensitive one. The complete absence of Na+ in the medium endangered the survival of both cell lines exposed to PEG. Although Na+ by itself contributed only for a small part to OA, NaCl induced an increase in proline concentration and stimulated the synthesis of glycinebetaine in response to PEG in photosynthetic tissues. Soluble sugars were the main contributors to OA and increased when tissues were simultaneously exposed to PEG and NaCl compared with PEG alone, suggesting that Na+ may influence sugar synthesis and/or translocation.
