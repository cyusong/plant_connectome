Understanding stomatal regulation is fundamental to predicting the impact of changing environmental conditions on vegetation. However, the influence of soil temperature (ST) and soil water content (SWC) on canopy conductance (g<sub>s</sub> ) through changes in belowground hydraulic conductance (k<sub>bg</sub> ) remains poorly understood, because k<sub>bg</sub> has seldom been measured in field conditions. Our aim was to (a) examine the dependence of k<sub>bg</sub> on ST and SWC, (b) examine the dependence of g<sub>s</sub> on k<sub>bg</sub> and (c) test a recent stomatal optimization model according to which g<sub>s</sub> and soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance are strongly coupled. We estimated k<sub>bg</sub> from continuous sap flow and xylem diameter measurements in three boreal species. k<sub>bg</sub> increased strongly with increasing ST when ST was below +8°C, and typically increased with increasing SWC when ST was not limiting. g<sub>s</sub> was correlated with k<sub>bg</sub> in all three species, and modelled and measured g<sub>s</sub> were well correlated in Pinus sylvestris (a model comparison was only possible for this species). These results imply an important role for k<sub>bg</sub> in mediating linkages between the soil environment and leaf gas exchange. In particular, our finding that ST strongly influences k<sub>bg</sub> in mature trees may help us to better understand tree behaviour in cold environments.
