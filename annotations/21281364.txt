['21281364', 'Copper is an essential micronutrient that functions as a redox cofactor in  multiple plant processes, including photosynthesis. Arabidopsis thaliana  possesses a conserved family of CTR-like high-affinity copper transport proteins  denoted as COPT1-5. COPT1, the only family member that is functionally  characterized, participates in plant copper acquisition. However, little is known  about the function of the other Arabidopsis COPT proteins in the transport and  distribution of copper. Here, we show that a functional fusion of COPT5 to the  green fluorescent protein localizes in Arabidopsis cells to the prevacuolar  compartment. Plants defective in COPT5 do not exhibit any significant phenotype  under copper-sufficient conditions, but their growth is compromised under copper  limitation. Under extreme copper deficiency, two independent copt5 knockout  mutant lines exhibit severe defects in vegetative growth and root elongation, low  chlorophyll content, and impairment in the photosynthetic electron transfer. All  these phenotypes are rescued when the wild-type copy of the COPT5 gene is  retransformed into a copt5 knockout line or when copper, but not other metals,  are added to the medium. COPT5 is expressed in vascular tissues, with elevated  levels in roots. Taken together, these results suggest that COPT5 plays an  important role in the plant response to environmental copper scarcity, probably  by remobilizing copper from prevacuolar vesicles, which could act as internal  stores or recycling vesicles to provide the metal cofactor to key  copper-dependent processes such as photosynthesis.', '2011 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04472.x', 'Puig']
