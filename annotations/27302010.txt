Plant antioxidants ascorbate and glutathione play an important role in regulating potentially harmful reactive oxygen species produced in response to virus infection. Barley yellow dwarf virus is a widespread viral pathogen that systemically infects cereal crops including wheat, barley and oats. In addition, rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> will alter plant growth and metabolism, including many potential but not well understood effects on plant-virus interactions. In order to better understand the wheat-BYDV interaction and any potential changes under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, the total concentration and oxidised fraction of ascorbate and glutathione was measured in leaves of a susceptible wheat cultivar (Triticum aestivum L. 'Yitpi') infected with Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV (Padi Avenae virus) and grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in controlled environment chambers. Virus infection decreased total leaf ascorbate and glutathione concentrations and increased the fraction of oxidised ascorbate (dehydroascorbate). Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> decreased the fraction of oxidised ascorbate. In this work, we demonstrate that systemic infection by a phloem-restricted virus weakens the antioxidant pools of ascorbate and glutathione. In addition, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may decrease oxidative stress, for example, from virus infection, but there was no direct evidence for an interactive effect between treatments.

Virus infection: !decreases! Total leaf ascorbate and glutathione concentrations
Virus infection: !increases! Fraction of oxidised ascorbate (dehydroascorbate)
Elevated CO<sub>2</sub>: !decreases! Fraction of oxidised ascorbate
