The presence of Cadmium (Cd) in the agricultural soils affects horticultural cultivars and constrains the crop productivity. A pot experiment was performed using five cultivars of mustard (Brassica juncea L.) to evaluate the difference in their response to Cd toxicity under greenhouse conditions. The pots containing reconstituted soil were supplied with different concentration of CdCl2 (0, 25, 50, 100 or 150 mg Cd kg-1 soil). Increasing concentration of Cd in the soil resulted in decreased growth, photosynthesis and yield. Maximum significant reduction in growth, photosynthesis and yield were observed with 150 mg Cd kg-1 soil in all the cultivars. Our results indicate that the cultivar Alankar is found to be more tolerant to Cd stress, recording higher plant dry mass, net photosynthesis rate, associated with high antioxidant activity and low Cd content in the plant leaves and thus less oxidative damage. Cultivar RH 30 experienced maximum damage in terms of reduction in growth, photosynthesis, yield characteristics and oxidative damage and emerged as sensitive cultivar. The data of tolerance index of Alankar were found to be higher among all tested mustard cultivars which indicate its higher tolerance to Cd. Better coordination of antioxidants protected Alankar from Cd toxicity, whereas lesser antioxidant activity in RH 30 resulted in maximum damage. Cultivars of mustard were ranked with respect to their tolerance to Cd: Alankar > Varuna > Pusa Bold > Sakha > RH 30, respectively.
