Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for all organisms. In crop plants, Fe deficiency can decrease crop yield significantly; however, our current understanding of how major crops respond to Fe deficiency remains limited. Herein, the effect of Fe deprivation at both the transcriptomic and metabolic level in hexaploid wheat was investigated. Genome-wide gene expression reprogramming was observed in wheat roots subjected to Fe starvation, with a total of 5854 genes differentially expressed. Homoeologue and subgenome-specific analysis unveiled the induction-biased contribution from the A and B genomes. In general, the predominance of genes coding for nicotianamine synthase, yellow stripe-like transporters, metal transporters, ABC transporters, and zinc-induced facilitator-like protein was noted. Expression of genes related to the Strategy II mode of Fe uptake was also predominant. Our transcriptomic data were in agreement with the GC-MS analysis that showed the enhanced accumulation of various metabolites such as fumarate, malonate, succinate, and xylofuranose, which could be contributing to Fe mobilization. Interestingly, Fe starvation leads to a significant temporal increase of glutathione S-transferase at both the transcriptional level and enzymatic activity level, which indicates the involvement of glutathione in response to Fe stress in wheat roots. Taken together, our result provides new insight into the wheat response to Fe starvation at the molecular level and lays the foundation to design new strategies for the improvement of Fe nutrition in crops.
