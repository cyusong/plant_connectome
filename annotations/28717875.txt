The similarity of IREH1 (Incomplete Root Hair Elongation 1) and animal MAST kinases was confirmed; IREH1cDNA was cloned while expressing in cultured animal cells co-localized with the centrosome. In mammals and fruit flies, microtubule-associated serine/threonine-protein kinases (MAST) are strongly involved in the regulation of the microtubule system. Higher plants also possess protein kinases homologous to MASTs, but their function and interaction with the cytoskeleton remain unclear. Here, we confirmed the sequence and structural similarity of MAST-related putative protein kinase IREH1 (At3g17850) and known animal MAST kinases. We report the first cloning of full-length cDNA of the IREH1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Recombinant GFP-IREH1 protein was expressed in different cultured animal cells. It revealed co-localization with the centrosome without influencing cell morphology and microtubule arrangement. Structural N-terminal region of the IREH1 molecule co-localized with centrosome as well.
