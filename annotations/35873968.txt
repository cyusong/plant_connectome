Cacti are one of the most significant and diversified groups of angiosperms, distributed and cultivated globally, mostly in semi-arid, arid, and the Mediterranean climate regions. Conventionally, they are propagated by seeds or through vegetative propagation <i>via</i> rooted offshoots or grafting. However, these multiplication procedures remain insufficient for mass propagation. <i>In vitro</i> culture techniques are utilized to mass propagate endangered and commercial cacti species. These include somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration through indirect or direct organogenesis. The latter is a promising tool for commercial clonal propagation of high-value species and has been successfully implemented for several species, such as <i>Mammillaria, Hylocereus, Cereus, Echinocereus</i>, and <i>Ariocarpus</i>. However, its success depends on explant type, basal nutrient formulation of culture medium, and types and concentrations of plant growth regulators. This study aimed to assess the potential of <i>in vitro</i> propagation methods applied to cacti species and discuss the different factors affecting the success of these methods. This study has also highlighted the insufficient work on <i>Opuntia</i> species for mass propagation through axillary buds' proliferation. The development of an efficient micropropagation protocol is thus needed to meet the supply of increasing demand of <i>Opuntia</i> species for human consumption as fruit, animal feed, and ecological restoration in semi-arid and arid zones.
