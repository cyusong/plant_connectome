Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), a biotrophic plant pathogen, secretes numerous effectors to modulate host defense systems. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which Pst effectors regulate wheat immunity is of great importance for the development of novel strategies for durable control of stripe rust. In this study, we identified a glycine-serine-rich effector gene, PstGSRE1, which is highly induced during early infection. Transgenic expression of PstGSRE1 RNAi constructs in wheat significantly reduced virulence of Pst and increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in wheat. PstGSRE1 was shown to target the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated transcription factor TaLOL2, a positive regulator of wheat immunity. PstGSRE1 disrupted nuclear localization of TaLOL2 and suppressed ROS-mediated cell death induced by TaLOL2, thus compromising host immunity. This work reveals a previously unrecognized strategy whereby rust fungi exploit the PstGSRE1 effector to defeat ROS-associated plant defense by modulating the subcellular compartment of a host immune regulator and facilitate pathogen infection.
