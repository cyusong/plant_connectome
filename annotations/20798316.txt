['20798316', 'Stem cells are maintained in the niche by intercellular interactions and  signaling networks. In this work, we study extracellular signals required for  maintenance of the root stem cell niche in higher plants. We identify a family of  functionally redundant homologous peptides that are secreted, tyrosine-sulfated,  and expressed mainly in the stem cell area and the innermost layer of central  columella cells. We name these peptides root meristem growth factors (RGFs). RGFs  are required for maintenance of the root stem cell niche and transit amplifying  cell proliferation in Arabidopsis. RGF1 defines expression levels and patterns of  the stem cell transcription factor PLETHORA, mainly at the posttranscriptional  level. The RGFs function independently of the auxin pathway. These peptide  signals play a crucial role in postembryonic root development.', '2010 Aug 27', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1191132', 'Matsubayashi']
