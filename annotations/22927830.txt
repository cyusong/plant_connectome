['22927830', 'In plants, multiple detached tissues are capable of forming a pluripotent cell  mass, termed callus, when cultured on media containing appropriate plant  hormones. Recent studies demonstrated that callus resembles the root-tip  meristem, even if it is derived from aerial organs. This finding improves our  understanding of the regeneration process of plant cells; however, the molecular  mechanism that guides cells of different tissue types to form a callus still  remains elusive. Here, we show that genome-wide reprogramming of histone H3  lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is a critical step in the leaf-to-callus  transition. The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is known to function in  establishing H3K27me3. By analyzing callus formation of mutants corresponding to  different histone modification pathways, we found that leaf blades and/or  cotyledons of the PRC2 mutants curly leaf swinger (clf swn) and embryonic flower2  (emf2) were defective in callus formation. We identified the H3K27me3-covered  loci in leaves and calli by a ChIP-chip assay, and we found that in the callus  H3K27me3 levels decreased first at certain auxin-pathway genes. The levels were  then increased at specific leaf genes but decreased at a number of  root-regulatory genes. Changes in H3K27me3 levels were negatively correlated with  expression levels of the corresponding genes. One possible role of PRC2-mediated  H3K27me3 in the leaf-to-callus transition might relate to elimination of leaf  features by silencing leaf-regulatory genes, as most leaf-preferentially  expressed regulatory genes could not be silenced in the leaf explants of clf swn.  In contrast to the leaf explants, the root explants of both clf swn and emf2  formed calli normally, possibly because the root-to-callus transition bypasses  the leaf gene silencing process. Furthermore, our data show that PRC2-mediated  H3K27me3 and H3K27 demethylation act in parallel in the reprogramming of H3K27me3  during the leaf-to-callus transition, suggesting a general mechanism for cell  fate transition in plants.', '2012 Aug', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1002911', 'Xu']
