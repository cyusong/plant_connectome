Medicinal plants are an important source for treatment of diseases in many countries. Today, controlling the quality of the products of medicinal plants is an important task. Customer health may be in danger due to the fraud and misconduct by the sales associates in the sales centers. Melissa officinalis L. (Lamiaceae) is an important medicinal plant used for treatment of several diseases. In Iran, the species of Dracocephalum, Hymencrater, Nepeta and Stachys are mistakenly sold under the name of Badranjboye that have different pharmaceutical properties. For avoiding this mistake, this investigation was performed with the following aims: 1) Checking for the cheating and identifying the Badranjboye in the Iran's market of medicinal plants, 2) Providing the molecular barcode for the medicinal species of Melissa. For this purpose, Market-sold plant samples (leaves) and original reference plant species were compared by morphology, odor as well as Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplast DNA ((psbA-trnH) and (trnL-trnF)) sequences. Various molecular analyses, such as sequencing, determination of genetic distance, and construction of phylogenetic tree were performed. These reports have shown that internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplast DNA (psbA-trnH) sequences are an efficient molecular marker to produce barcode gap and differentiating Melissa officinalis from other species.
