The upcoming climate change presents a great challenge for plant growth and development being extremes temperatures among the major environmental limitations to crop productivity. Understanding the repercussions of these extreme temperatures is of high importance to elaborate future strategies to confront crop damages. Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) are one of the most cultivated crops and their fruits are consumed worldwide standing out for their organoleptic characteristics and nutritional value. Tomato plants are sensitive to temperatures below 12 °C and above 32 °C. In this study, Micro-Tom cultivar was used to evaluate the effects of extreme temperatures on the plant of tomato and the fruit productivity and quality from the stressed plants, either exposed to cold (4 °C for three nights per week) or heat (32 °C during the day, seven days per week) treatments. Total productivity and the percentage of ripe fruits per plant were evaluated together with foliar stress markers and the contents of photosynthetic pigments and tocochromanols. Fruit quality was also assessed determining lycopene contents, total soluble solids, total acidity and ascorbate contents. High temperatures altered multiple physiological parameters indicating a moderate stress, particularly decreasing fruit yield. As a response to this stress, plants enhanced their antioxidant contents both at leaf and fruit level. Low temperatures did not negatively affect the physiology of plants with similar yields as compared to controls, suggesting chilling acclimation. Both high and low temperatures, but most particularly the former, increased total soluble solids contents indicating that temperature control may be used as a strategy to modulate fruit quality.
