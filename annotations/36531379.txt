<i>SEP</i> genes are famous for their function in the morphological novelty of bisexual flowers. Although the diverse functions of <i>SEP</i> genes were reported, only the regulatory mechanisms underlying floral organ development have been addressed. In this study, we identified <i>SEP</i>-like genes in <i>Gossypium</i> and found that <i>SEP3</i> genes were duplicated in diploid cotton varieties. <i>GhSEP4.1</i> and <i>GhSEP4.2</i> were abundantly transcribed in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), but only <i>GhSEP4.2</i> was expressed in the leaf vasculature. The expression pattern of <i>GhSEP</i>s in floral organs was conserved with that of homologs in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, except for <i>GhSEP2</i> that was preponderantly expressed in ovules and fibers. The overexpression and silencing of each single <i>GhSEP</i> gene suggested their distinct role in promoting flowering <i>via</i> direct binding to <i>GhAP1</i> and <i>GhLFY</i> genomic regions. The curly leaf and floral defects in overexpression lines with a higher expression of <i>GhSEP</i> genes revealed the concentration-dependent target gene regulation of GhSEP proteins. Moreover, GhSEP proteins were able to dimerize and interact with flowering time regulators. Together, our results suggest the dominant role of <i>GhSEP4.2</i> in leaves to promote flowering <i>via GhAP1-A04</i>, and differently accumulated GhSEP proteins in the SAM alternately participate in forming the dynamic tetramer complexes to target at the different loci of <i>GhAP1</i> and <i>GhLFY</i> to maintain reproductive growth. The regulatory roles of cotton <i>SEP</i> genes reveal their conserved and diversified functions.
