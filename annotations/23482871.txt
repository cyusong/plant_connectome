Treatment of barley (Hordeum vulgare) seedlings with arsenite (AsIII) rapidly induced physiological and transcriptional changes characteristic of sulfur deficiency, even in plants replete with sulfur. AsIII and sulfur deficiency induced 5- to 20-fold increases in the three genes responsible for sulfate reduction. Both treatments also caused up-regulation of a sulfate transporter, but only in the case of sulfur deficiency was there an increase in sulfate influx. Longer-term changes included reduction in transfer of sulfur from roots to shoots and an increase in root growth relative to shoot growth. Genes involved in complexation and compartmentation of arsenic were up-regulated by AsIII, but not by sulfur deficiency. The rate at which arsenic accumulated appeared to be controlled by the rate of thiol synthesis. Over a range of AsIII concentrations and growth periods, the ratio of thiols to arsenic was always close to 3:1, which is consistent with the formation of a stable complex between three glutathione molecules per AsIII. The greater toxicity of arsenic under sulfur-limiting conditions is likely to be due to an intensification of sulfur deficiency as a result of thiol synthesis, rather than to a direct toxicity to metabolism. Because influx of AsIII was nearly 20-fold faster than the rate of synthesis of thiols, it is questionable whether this complexation strategy can be effective in preventing arsenic toxicity, unless arsenic uptake becomes limited by diffusive resistances in the rhizosphere.
