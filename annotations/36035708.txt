Cucumber is an important vegetable in China, and its yield and cultivation area are among the largest in the world. Excessive temperatures lead to high-temperature disorder in cucumber. Heat shock protein 20 (HSP20), an essential protein in the process of plant growth and development, is a universal protective protein with stress resistance. HSP20 plays crucial roles in plants under stress. In this study, we characterized the <i>HSP20</i> gene family in cucumber by studying chromosome location, gene duplication, phylogenetic relationships, gene structure, conserved motifs, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements. A total of 30 <i>CsHSP20</i> genes were identified, distributed across 6 chromosomes, and classified into 11 distinct subgroups based on conserved motif composition, gene structure analyses, and phylogenetic relationships. According to the synteny analysis, cucumber had a closer relationship with <i>Arabidopsis</i> and soybean than with rice and maize. Collinearity analysis revealed that gene duplication, including tandem and segmental duplication, occurred as a result of positive selection and purifying selection. Promoter analysis showed that the putative promoters of <i>CsHSP20</i> genes contained growth, stress, and hormone <i>cis</i>-elements, which were combined with protein-protein interaction networks to reveal their potential function mechanism. We further analyzed the gene expression of <i>CsHSP20</i> genes under high stress and found that the majority of the <i>CsHSP20</i> genes were upregulated, suggesting that these genes played a positive role in the heat stress-mediated pathway at the seedling stage. These results provide comprehensive information on the <i>CsHSP20</i> gene family in cucumber and lay a solid foundation for elucidating the biological functions of CsHSP20. This study also provides valuable information on the regulation mechanism of the <i>CsHSP20</i> gene family in the high-temperature resistance of cucumber.
