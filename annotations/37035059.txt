HOX32, a member of the HD-ZIP III family, functions in the leaf morphogenesis and plant photosynthesis. However, the regulatory mechanism of HOX32 in maize has not been studied and the regulatory relationship in photosynthesis is unclear. We conducted a comprehensive study, including phylogenetic analysis, expression profiling at both transcriptome and translatome levels, subcellular localization, tsCUT&Tag, co-expression analysis, and association analysis with agronomic traits on HOX32 for the dissection of the functional roles of HOX32. <i>ZmHOX32</i> shows conservation in plants. As expected, maize HOX32 protein is specifically expressed in the nucleus. <i>ZmHOX32</i> showed constitutively expression at both transcriptome and translatome levels. We uncovered the downstream target genes of ZmHOX32 by tsCUT&Tag and constructed a cascaded regulatory network combining the co-expression networks. Both direct and indirect targets of ZmHOX32 showed significant gene ontology enrichment in terms of photosynthesis in maize. The association study suggested that <i>ZmHOX32</i> plays an important role in regulation of plant architecture. Our results illustrate a complex regulatory network of HOX32 involving in photosynthesis and plant architecture, which deepens our understanding of the phenotypic variation in plants.
