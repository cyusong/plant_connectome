Pathogenic animal and human viruses present a growing and persistent threat to humans worldwide. Ebola virus (EBOV) causes zoonosis in humans. Here, two structurally different anti-Ebola 13F6 antibodies, recognizing the heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain (MLD) of the glycoprotein (GP), were expressed in transgenic <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> plants and designed as inexpensive and effective diagnostic antibodies against Ebola virus disease (EVD). The first was anti-EBOV 13F6 full size antibody with heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) (monoclonal antibody, mAb 13F6-FULL), while the second was a large single-chain (LSC) antibody (mAb 13F6-LSC). mAb 13F6-LSC was constructed by linking the 13F6 LC variable region (VL) with the HC of mAb 13F6-FULL using a peptide linker and extended to the C-terminus using the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motif KDEL. <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated plant transformation was employed to express the antibodies in <i>N. tabacum</i>. PCR, RT-PCR, and immunoblot analyses confirmed the gene insertion, transcription, and protein expression of these antibodies, respectively. The antibodies tagged with the KDEL motif displayed high-mannose type <i>N</i>-glycan structures and efficient binding to EBOV-like particles (VLPs). Thus, various forms of anti-EBOV plant-derived mAbs 13F6-FULL and LSC with efficient binding affinity to EBOV VLP can be produced in the plant system.
