['18632581', 'Proteins containing the forkhead-associated domain (FHA) are known to act in  biological processes such as DNA damage repair, protein degradation, and signal  transduction. Here we report that DAWDLE (DDL), an FHA domain-containing protein  in Arabidopsis, acts in the biogenesis of miRNAs and endogenous siRNAs. Unlike  mutants of genes known to participate in the processing of miRNA precursors, such  as dcl1, hyponastic leaves1, and serrate, ddl mutants show reduced levels of  pri-miRNAs as well as mature miRNAs. Promoter activity of MIR genes, however, is  not affected by ddl mutations. DDL is an RNA binding protein and is able to  interact with DCL1. In addition, we found that SNIP1, the human homolog of DDL,  is involved in miRNA biogenesis and interacts with Drosha. Therefore, we  uncovered an evolutionarily conserved factor in miRNA biogenesis. We propose that  DDL participates in miRNA biogenesis by facilitating DCL1 to access or recognize  pri-miRNAs.', '2008 Jul 22', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0804218105', 'Chen']
