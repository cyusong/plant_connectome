['9830017', 'Serine acetyltransferase (SATase; EC 2.3.1.30), which catalyzes the formation of  O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS) from acetyl-CoA and L-serine, plays a regulatory role in  the biosynthesis of cysteine by its property of feedback inhibition by cysteine  in bacteria and certain plants. Three cDNA clones encoding SATase isoforms  (SAT-c, SAT-p, and SAT-m) have been isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana. However,  the significance of the feedback regulation has not yet been clear in these  different isoforms of SATase from A. thaliana. We constructed the overexpression  vectors for cDNAs encoding three SATase isoforms of A. thaliana and analyzed the  inhibition of SATase activity by cysteine using the recombinant SATase proteins.  In the case of SAT-c, the activity was feedback-inhibited by a low concentration  of cysteine (the concentration that inhibits 50% activity; IC50 = 1.8 microM). By  contrast, SAT-p and SAT-m were feedback inhibition-insensitive isozymes. We also  determined the subcellular localization of three SATase isozymes by the transient  expression of fusion proteins of each SATase N-terminal region with jellyfish  green fluorescent protein (GFP) in 4-week-old Arabidopsis leaves. The SAT-c-GFP  fusion protein was stayed in cytosol, whereas SAT-p-GFP and SAT-m-GFP fusion  proteins were localized in chloroplasts and in mitochondria, respectively. These  results suggest that these three SATase isoforms, which are localized in the  different organelles, are subjected to different feedback regulation, presumably  so as to play the particular roles for the production of OAS and cysteine in  Arabidopsis cells. Regulatory circuit of cysteine biosynthesis in the plant cells  is discussed.', '1998 Dec 4', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.273.49.32739', 'Saito']
