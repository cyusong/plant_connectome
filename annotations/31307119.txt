Blood orange is generally recognized to accumulate anthocyanins in its fruit pulp in a cold-inducible manner. We observed that the fruit peel of blood orange can also accumulate anthocyanins under ample light conditions. Interestingly, purple pummelo can accumulate anthocyanins only in its fruit peel but not in its pulp. The mechanism underlying the tissue specificity of anthocyanin accumulation in citrus is unknown. Here, we show that the active promoter of Ruby1, a key activator of anthocyanin biosynthesis, is also light inducible in addition to its already known cold inducibility in blood orange. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transient expression assays showed that HY5 positively regulated the transcription of Ruby1 by binding to the G-box motif (CACGTC). The tissue specificity of anthocyanin accumulation in the peel of purple pummelo may be due to the lack of a low temperature responsive element and a MYC binding site, which were shown to be involved in cold inducibility of CsRuby1 in blood orange by insertion of a long terminal repeat type retrotransposon in the promoter. These results bring new insights into the regulatory mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in response to environmental stimuli and provide cis-elements for genetic improvement of anthocyanin-stable fruits rich in antioxidant metabolites.
