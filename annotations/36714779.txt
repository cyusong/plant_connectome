Spatial distribution and orientation of pods on the main raceme (stem) and branches could affect rapeseed yield. However, genomic regions underlying the pod orientation were not described in <i>Brassica</i> species. Here, we determined the extent of genetic variation in pod orientation, described as the angles of pedicel on raceme (APR) and angles of the pod on pedicel (APP) among 136 rapeseed accessions grown across three environments of the upper, middle and lower Yangtze River in China. The APR ranged from 59° to 109°, while the APP varied from 142° to 178°. Statistical analysis showed that phenotypic variation was due to genotypic (G) and environmental (E) effects. Using the genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) approach, two QTLs for APR (qBnAPR.A02 and qBnAPR.C02) and two for APP (qBnAPP.A05 and qBnAPP.C05), having minor to moderate allelic effects (4.30% to 19.47%) were identified. RNA-seq analysis revealed 606 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in two rapeseed accessions representing the extreme phenotypes for pod orientation and different alleles at the QTLs of APR. Three DEGs (<i>BnLAZY4.A02</i>, <i>BnSAUR32.A02</i>, and <i>BnSAUR32.C02</i>) were identified as the most likely candidates responsible for variation in pod orientation (APR). This study elucidates the genomic regions and putative candidate genes underlying pod orientation in <i>B. napus</i>.
