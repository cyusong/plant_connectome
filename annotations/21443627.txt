The RLK/Pelle class of proteins kinases is composed of over 600 members in Arabidopsis. Many of the proteins in this family are receptor-like kinases (RLK), while others have lost their extracellular domains and are found as cytoplasmic kinases. Proteins in this family that are RLKs have a variety of extracellular domains that drive function in a large number of processes, from cell wall interactions to disease resistance to developmental control. This review will briefly cover the major subclasses of RLK/Pelle proteins and their roles. In addition, two specific groups on RLKs will be discussed in detail, relating recent findings in Arabidopsis and how well these conclusions have been able to be translated to agronomically important species. Finally, some details on kinase activity and signal transduction will be addressed, along with the mystery of RLK/Pelle members lacking kinase enzymatic activity.
