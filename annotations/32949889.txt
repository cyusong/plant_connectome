Periodic changes of light and dark regulate numerous processes in plants. Recently, a novel type of stress caused by an extended light period has been described in Arabidopsis thaliana and was named photoperiod stress. Although photoperiod stress causes the induction of numerous stress response genes of which many are indicators of oxidative stress, the exact timing and mechanisms involved in dealing with this stress have not yet been investigated. We describe the response of the cellular redox system in wild-type Arabidopsis, the photoperiod stress sensitive cytokinin receptor mutant ahk2 ahk3 and the clock mutant cca1 lhy. Photoperiod stress caused several changes in the ROS scavenging system including a reduction of the ascorbic acid (AsA) redox status and strong peroxide formation during the night following the extended photoperiod. The changes were associated with reduced catalase (CAT) and increased apoplastic peroxidase (PRX) activities. Consistently, the expression of the apoplastic PRX genes PRX4, PRX33, PRX34 and PRX71 was strongly induced by photoperiod stress. We show that extending the light period by only few hours causes a stress response during the following night suggesting that the photoperiod stress response might occur in a natural setting.
