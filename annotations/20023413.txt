Chloroplasts arose from a cyanobacterial endosymbiont and multiply by division, reminiscent of their free-living ancestor. However, chloroplasts can not divide by themselves, and the division is performed and controlled by proteins that are encoded by the host nucleus. The continuity of chloroplasts was originally established by synchronization of endosymbiotic cell division with host cell division, as seen in existent algae. In contrast, land plant cells contain multiple chloroplasts, the division of which is not synchronized, even in the same cell. Land plants have evolved cell and chloroplast differentiation systems in which the size and number of chloroplasts (or other types of plastids) change along with their respective cellular function by changes in the division rate. We recently reported that PLASTID DIVISION (PDV) proteins, land-plant specific components of the chloroplast division apparatus, determined the rate of chloroplast division. The level of PDV protein is regulated by the cell differentiation program based on cytokinin, and the increase or decrease of the PDV level gives rise to an increase or decrease in the chloroplast division rate. Thus, the integration of PDV proteins into the chloroplast division machinery enabled land plant cells to change chloroplast size and number in accord with the fate of cell differentiation.
