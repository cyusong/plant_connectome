Leaf senescence proceeds with age but is modulated by various environmental stresses and hormones. Salt stress is one of the most well-known environmental stresses that accelerate leaf senescence. However, the molecular mechanisms that integrate salt stress signalling with leaf senescence programmes remain elusive. In this study, we characterised the role of ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR34 (ERF34), an Arabidopsis APETALA2 (AP2)/ERF family transcription factor, in leaf senescence. ERF34 was differentially expressed under various leaf senescence-inducing conditions, and negatively regulated leaf senescence induced by age, dark, and salt stress. ERF34 also promoted salt stress tolerance at different stages of the plant life cycle such as seed germination and vegetative growth. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the overexpression of ERF34 increased the transcript levels of salt stress-responsive genes including COLD-REGULATED15A (COR15A), EARLY RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION10 (ERD10), and RESPONSIVE TO DESICCATION29A (RD29A). Moreover, ERF34 directly bound to ERD10 and RD29A promoters and activated their expression. Our findings indicate that ERF34 plays a key role in the convergence of the salt stress response with the leaf senescence programmes, and is a potential candidate for crop improvement, particularly by enhancing salt stress tolerance.
