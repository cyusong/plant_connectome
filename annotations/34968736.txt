Oxidative post-translational modifications of specific chloroplast proteins contribute to the initiation of retrograde signaling. The Arabidopsis thaliana EXECUTER1 (EX1) protein, a chloroplast-localized singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) sensor, undergoes tryptophan (Trp) 643 oxidation by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, a chloroplast-derived and light-dependent reactive oxygen species. The indole side chain of Trp is vulnerable to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, leading to the generation of oxidized Trp variants and priming EX1 for degradation by a membrane-bound FtsH protease. The perception of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> via Trp643 oxidation and subsequent EX1 proteolysis facilitate chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling. In this study, we discovered that the EX1-like protein EX2 also undergoes <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent Trp530 oxidation and FtsH-dependent turnover, which attenuates <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> signaling by decelerating EX1-Trp643 oxidation and subsequent EX1 degradation. Consistent with this finding, the loss of EX2 function reinforces EX1-dependent retrograde signaling by accelerating EX1-Trp643 oxidation and subsequent EX1 proteolysis, whereas overexpression of EX2 produces molecular phenotypes opposite to those observed in the loss-of- function mutants of EX2. Intriguingly, phylogenetic analysis suggests that EX2 may have emerged evolutionarily to attenuate the sensitivity of EX1 toward <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Collectively, these results suggest that EX2 functions as a negative regulator of the EX1 signalosome through its own <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent oxidation, providing a new mechanistic insight into the regulation of EX1-mediated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> signaling.
