Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ) is a source of plant nutrients and osmolytes, but its delivery machineries under osmotic and low-nutrient stress remain largely unknown. Here, we report that AtICln, an Arabidopsis homolog of the nucleotide-sensitive chloride-conductance regulatory protein family (ICln), is involved in response to osmotic and low-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> stress. The gene AtICln, encoding plasma membrane-anchored proteins, was upregulated by various osmotic stresses, and its disruption impaired plant tolerance to osmotic stress. Compared with the wild type, the aticln mutant retained lower anions, particularly NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> , and its growth retardation was not rescued by NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> supply under osmotic stress. Interestingly, this mutant also displayed growth defects under low-NO<sub>3</sub> stress, which were accompanied by decreases in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> accumulation, suggesting that AtICln may facilitate the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> accumulation under NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deficiency. Moreover, the low-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> hypersensitive phenotype of aticln mutant was overridden by the overexpression of NRT1.1, an important NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporter in Arabidopsis low-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> responses. Further genetic analysis in the plants with altered activity of AtICln and NRT1.1 indicated that AtICln and NRT1.1 play a compensatory role in maintaining NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> homeostasis under low-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> environments. These results suggest that AtICln is involved in cellular NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> accumulation and thus determines osmotic adjustment and low-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> tolerance in plants.
