The Arabidopsis thaliana F-box protein MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2) has previously been characterized for its role in plant development. MAX2 appears essential for the perception of the newly characterized phytohormone strigolactone, a negative regulator of polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis. A reverse genetic screen for F-box protein mutants altered in their stress responses identified MAX2 as a component of plant defense. Here we show that MAX2 contributes to plant resistance against pathogenic bacteria. Interestingly, max2 mutant plants showed increased susceptibility to the bacterial necrotroph Pectobacterium carotovorum as well as to the hemi-biotroph Pseudomonas syringae but not to the fungal necrotroph Botrytis cinerea. max2 mutant phenotype was associated with constitutively increased stomatal conductance and decreased tolerance to apoplastic ROS but also with alterations in hormonal balance. Our results suggest that MAX2 previously characterized for its role in regulation of polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis, and thus plant development also significantly influences plant disease resistance. We conclude that the increased susceptibility to P. syringae and P. carotovorum is due to increased stomatal conductance in max2 mutants promoting pathogen entry into the plant apoplast. Additional factors contributing to pathogen susceptibility in max2 plants include decreased tolerance to pathogen-triggered apoplastic ROS and alterations in hormonal signaling.
