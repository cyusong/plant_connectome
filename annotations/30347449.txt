Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) is ubiquitous in cells and at the centre of developmental programmes and environmental responses. Its chemistry in cells makes H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> notoriously hard to detect dynamically, specifically and at high resolution. Genetically encoded sensors overcome persistent shortcomings, but pH sensitivity, silencing of expression and a limited concept of sensor behaviour in vivo have hampered any meaningful H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> sensing in living plants. We established H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> monitoring in the cytosol and the mitochondria of Arabidopsis with the fusion protein roGFP2-Orp1 using confocal microscopy and multiwell fluorimetry. We confirmed sensor oxidation by H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> , show insensitivity to physiological pH changes, and demonstrated that glutathione dominates sensor reduction in vivo. We showed the responsiveness of the sensor to exogenous H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> , pharmacologically-induced H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> release, and genetic interference with the antioxidant machinery in living Arabidopsis tissues. Monitoring intracellular H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> dynamics in response to elicitor exposure reveals the late and prolonged impact of the oxidative burst in the cytosol that is modified in redox mutants. We provided a well defined toolkit for H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> monitoring in planta and showed that intracellular H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> measurements only carry meaning in the context of the endogenous thiol redox systems. This opens new possibilities to dissect plant H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> dynamics and redox regulation, including intracellular NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS signalling.
