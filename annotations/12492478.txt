['12492478', 'Tocopherols are essential micronutrients in human and animal nutrition due to  their function as lipophilic antioxidants. They are exclusively synthesized by  photosynthetic organisms including higher plants. Despite the attributed  beneficial health effects and many industrial applications, research on the  tocopherol biosynthetic pathway and its regulation in plants is still limited. In  the work presented here we performed a detailed biochemical characterization of a  gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase (gamma-TMT) from Arabidopsis thaliana and of a  gamma-TMT purified from Capsicum annuum fruits, a tissue with high accumulation  of tocopherols. The biochemical characteristics of both enzyme preparations were  remarkably similar including substrate specificities. Both enzymes converted  delta- and gamma- into beta- and alpha-tocopherol, respectively, but  beta-tocopherol was not accepted as a substrate, pointing to a specific  methylation at the C(5)-position of the tocopherol aromatic head group. A kinetic  analysis performed with the Arabidopsis enzyme was consistent with an iso-ordered  bi-bi type reaction mechanism. Our results emphasize the role of gamma-TMT in  regulating the spectrum of accumulated tocopherols in plants.', '2003 Jan', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03364.x', 'Mock']
