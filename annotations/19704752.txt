Fungi and the oomycetes include several groups of plant pathogenic microbes. Although these two eukaryotic groups are unrelated they have a number of phenotypic similarities suggested to have evolved convergently. We have recently shown that gene transfer events have occurred from fungi to the oomycetes. These gene transfer events appear to be only one part of a complex and chimeric ancestry for the oomycete genome, which has also received genes from a red algal endosymbiont.
