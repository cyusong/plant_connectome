Following pollen deposition on the receptive surface of the stigma, pollen germinates a tube that carries male gametes toward the ovule where fertilization occurs. As soon as it emerges from the pollen grain, the pollen tube has to be properly guided through the pistil tissues so as to reach the ovule and ensure double fertilization. Chemical attractants, nutrients as well as receptor kinase-dependent signaling pathways have been implicated in this guidance. Recently, we showed in Arabidopsis that the microtubule severing enzyme KATANIN, by acting both on cortical microtubule (CMT) dynamics and cellulose microfibril (CMF) deposition, conferred particular mechanical properties to the papilla cell wall that act as active guidance factors. Here we confirm the importance of KATANIN and CMT orientation in pollen tube directionality by examining another <i>katanin</i> mutant.
