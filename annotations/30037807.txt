Bait fusion proteins with a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol signal sequence anchor enable effective split ubiquitin screening for interactions with otherwise soluble membrane proteins.

Bait fusion protein: !anchors! Glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol signal sequence 
Split ubiquitin: !enables screening for interactions with! Otherwise soluble membrane proteins
