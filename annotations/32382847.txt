An artificial lignified cell wall was synthesized in three steps: (1) isolation of microfibrillar network; (2) localization of peroxidase through immunoreaction; and (3) polymerization of DHP to lignify the cell wall. Artificial woody cell wall synthesis was performed following the three steps along with the actual formation in nature using cellulose microfibrils extracted from callus derived from Cryptomeria japonica. First, we constructed a polysaccharide network on a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid. The preparation method was optimized by chemical treatment, followed by mechanical fibrillation to create a microfibrillated network. Morphology was examined by TEM, and chemical characterization was by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Second, we optimized the process to place peroxidase on the microfibrils via an immunoreaction technique. Using a xyloglucan antibody, we could ensure that gold particles attached to the secondary antibodies were widely and uniformly localized along with the microfibril network. Third, we applied the peroxidase attached to secondary antibodies and started to polymerize the lignin on the grid by simultaneously adding coniferyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide. After 30 min of artificial lignification, TEM observation showed that lignin-like substances were deposited on the polysaccharide network. In addition, FTIR spectra revealed that the bands specific for lignin had increased, demonstrating the successful artificial formation of woody cell walls. This approach may be useful for studying woody cell wall formation and for producing made-to-order biomaterials.
