Molecular plant pathology has focused on studying large-effect qualitative resistance loci that predominantly function in detecting pathogens and/or transmitting signals resulting from pathogen detection. By contrast, less is known about quantitative resistance loci, particularly the molecular mechanisms controlling variation in quantitative resistance. Recent studies have provided insight into these mechanisms, showing that genetic variation at hundreds of causal genes may underpin quantitative resistance. Loci controlling quantitative resistance contain some of the same causal genes that mediate qualitative resistance, but the predominant mechanisms of quantitative resistance extend beyond pathogen recognition. Indeed, most causal genes for quantitative resistance encode specific defense-related outputs such as strengthening of the cell wall or defense compound biosynthesis. Extending previous work on qualitative resistance to focus on the mechanisms of quantitative resistance, such as the link between perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns and growth, has shown that the mechanisms underlying these defense outputs are also highly polygenic. Studies that include genetic variation in the pathogen have begun to highlight a potential need to rethink how the field considers broad-spectrum resistance and how it is affected by genetic variation within pathogen species and between pathogen species. These studies are broadening our understanding of quantitative resistance and highlighting the potentially vast scale of the genetic basis of quantitative resistance.
