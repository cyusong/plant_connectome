Stalk strength is one of the most important traits in maize, which affects stalk lodging resistance and, consequently, maize harvestable yield. Rind penetrometer resistance (RPR) as an effective and reliable measurement for evaluating maize stalk strength is positively correlated with stalk lodging resistance. In this study, one F<sub>2</sub> and three F<sub>2:3</sub> populations derived from the cross of inbred lines 3705I (the low RPR line) and LH277 (the high RPR line) were constructed for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL), conferring RPR in maize. Fourteen RPR QTLs were identified in four environments and explained the phenotypic variation of RPR from 4.14 to 15.89%. By using a sequential fine-mapping strategy based on the progeny test, two major QTLs, <i>qRPR1-3</i> and <i>qRPR3-1</i>, were narrowed down to 4-Mb and 550-kb genomic interval, respectively. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was adopted to identify 12 candidate genes responsible for QTL <i>qRPR3-1</i>. These findings should facilitate the identification of the polymorphism loci underlying QTL <i>qRPR3-1</i> and molecular breeding for RPR in maize.
