Plant transcriptomes encompass a large number of functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), only some of which have protein-coding capacity. Since their initial discovery, ncRNAs have been classified into two broad categories based on their biogenesis and mechanisms of action, housekeeping ncRNAs and regulatory ncRNAs. With advances in RNA sequencing technology and computational methods, bioinformatics resources continue to emerge and update rapidly, including workflow for in silico ncRNA analysis, up-to-date platforms, databases, and tools dedicated to ncRNA identification and functional annotation. In this review, we aim to describe the biogenesis, biological functions, and interactions with DNA, RNA, protein, and microorganism of five major regulatory ncRNAs (miRNA, siRNA, tsRNA, circRNA, lncRNA) in plants. Then, we systematically summarize tools for analysis and prediction of plant ncRNAs, as well as databases. Furthermore, we discuss the silico analysis process of these ncRNAs and present a protocol for step-by-step computational analysis of ncRNAs. In general, this review will help researchers better understand the world of ncRNAs at multiple levels.
