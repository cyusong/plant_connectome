<b>:</b> Casein kinase I (CK1), a ubiquitous serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase in eukaryotes, plays pivotal roles in a wide spectrum of cellular functions including metabolism, cell cycle progression, developmental control and stress responses. Plant CK1 evolves a lineage expansion, resulting in a unique branch of members exclusive to the kingdom. Among them, Arabidopsis Mut9p-LIKE KINASEs (MLKs) target diverse substrates including histones and the key regulatory proteins involving in physiological processes of light signaling, circadian rhythms, phytohormone and plant defense. Deregulation of the kinase activity by mutating the enzyme or the phosphorylation sites of substrates causes developmental disorders and susceptibility to adverse environmental conditions. MLKs have evolved as a general kinase that modifies transcription factors or primary regulatory proteins in a dynamic way. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of the roles of <i>MLKs</i> and <i>MLK</i> orthologs in several commercially important crops.
