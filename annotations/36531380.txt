<i>Phalaenopsis</i> orchids are one of the most important exporting commodities for Taiwan. Most orchids are planted and grown in greenhouses. Early detection of orchid diseases is crucially valuable to orchid farmers during orchid cultivation. At present, orchid viral diseases are generally identified with manual observation and the judgment of the grower's experience. The most commonly used assays for virus identification are nucleic acid amplification and serology. However, it is neither time nor cost efficient. Therefore, this study aimed to create a system for automatically identifying the common viral diseases in orchids using the orchid image. Our methods include the following steps: the image preprocessing by color space transformation and gamma correction, detection of leaves by a U-net model, removal of non-leaf fragment areas by connected component labeling, feature acquisition of leaf texture, and disease identification by the two-stage model with the integration of a random forest model and an inception network (deep learning) model. Thereby, the proposed system achieved the excellent accuracy of 0.9707 and 0.9180 for the image segmentation of orchid leaves and disease identification, respectively. Furthermore, this system outperformed the naked-eye identification for the easily misidentified categories [cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV) and odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV)] with the accuracy of 0.842 using two-stage model and 0.667 by naked-eye identification. This system would benefit the orchid disease recognition for <i>Phalaenopsis</i> cultivation.
