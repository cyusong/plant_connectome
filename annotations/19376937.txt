Secretory proteins and extracellular glycans are transported to the extracellular space during cell growth. These materials are carried in secretory vesicles generated at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Analysis of the mammalian post-Golgi secretory pathway demonstrated the movement of separated secretory vesicles in the cell. Using secretory carrier membrane protein 2 (SCAMP2) as a marker for secretory vesicles and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) BY-2 cell as a model cell, we characterized the transport machinery in plant cells. A combination of analyses, including electron microscopy of quick-frozen cells and four-dimensional analysis of cells expressing fluorescent-tagged SCAMP2, enabled the identification of a clustered structure of secretory vesicles generated from TGN that moves in the cell and eventually fuses with plasma membrane. This structure was termed the secretory vesicle cluster (SVC). The SVC was also found in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) cells and moved to the cell plate in dividing tobacco cells. Thus, the SVC is a motile structure involved in mass transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and cell plate in plant cells.
