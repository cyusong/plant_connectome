['22001205', 'Phototropin is a blue light receptor in plants and is thought to be a  light-regulated protein kinase. Previously, we defined the role of the  photoreceptive domains, LOV1 and 2, in the light activation of the kinase in  Arabidopsis phototropin2 (phot2). In this study, photoregulation of the kinase in  phototropin1 (phot1) was studied using LOV2-linker-kinase polypeptide. We  designed a new substrate consisting of the N-terminal part of the phot1 with  autophosphorylation sites. The LOV2-linker-kinase had the same spectroscopic  properties as those of the LOV2 core and phosphorylated the substrate in a  light-dependent manner. Amino acid substitution experiments proved that the  phosphorylation comes from the activation of the kinase via photoreaction of  LOV2.', '2011 Nov 4', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2011.10.003', 'Tokutomi']
