['29043675', 'Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play vital roles in all subcellular processes  and a number of tools have been developed for their detection and analysis. Each  method has its unique set of benefits and drawbacks that need to be considered  prior to their application. In fact, researchers are spoilt for choice when it  comes to deciding which method to use for the initial detection of a PPI, and  which to corroborate the findings. With constant improvements in microscope  development, the possibilities of techniques to study PPIs in vivo, and in real  time, are continuously enhanced, and expanded. Here, we describe three common  approaches, their recent improvements incorporating a 2in1-cloning approach, and  their application in plant cell biology: ratiometric Bimolecular Fluorescence  Complementation (rBiFC), FRET Acceptor Photobleaching (FRET-AB), and Fluorescent  Lifetime Imaging (FRET-FLIM), using Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and Arabidopsis  thaliana cell culture protoplasts as transient expression systems.', '2018', 'Methods Mol Biol', '10.1007/978-1-4939-7389-7_11', 'Grefen']
