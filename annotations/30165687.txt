Calcium-dependent protein kinases are involved in various biological processes, including hormone response, growth and development, abiotic stress response, disease resistance, and nitrogen metabolism. We identified a novel mutant of a calcium-dependent protein-kinase-encoding gene, esl4, by performing map cloning. The esl4 mutant was nitrogen deficient, and expression and enzyme activities of genes related to nitrogen metabolism were down-regulated. ESL4 was mainly expressed in the vascular bundles of roots, stems, leaves, and sheaths. The ESL4 protein was localized in the cell membranes. Enzyme activity and physiological index analyzes and analysis of the expression of nitrogen metabolism and senescence-related genes indicated that ESL4 was involved in nitrogen metabolism. ESL4 overexpression in transgenic homozygous T2 plants increased nitrogen-use efficiency, improving yields when little nitrogen was available. The seed-set rates, yields per plant, numbers of grains per plant, grain nitrogen content ratios, and total nitrogen content per plant were significantly or very significantly higher for two ESL4 overexpression lines than for the control plants. These results suggest that ESL4 may function upstream of nitrogen-metabolism genes. The results will allow ESL4 to be used to breed novel cultivars for growing in low-nitrogen conditions.
