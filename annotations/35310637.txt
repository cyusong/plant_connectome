Flavones predominantly accumulate as <i>O</i>- and <i>C</i>-glycosides in kumquat plants. Two catalytic mechanisms of flavone synthase II (FNSII) support the biosynthesis of glycosyl flavones, one involving flavanone 2-hydroxylase (which generates 2-hydroxyflavanones for <i>C</i>-glycosylation) and another involving the direct catalysis of flavanones to flavones for <i>O</i>-glycosylation. However, FNSII has not yet been characterized in kumquats. In this study, we identified two kumquat <i>FNSII</i> genes (<i>FcFNSII-1</i> and <i>FcFNSII-2</i>), based on transcriptome and bioinformatics analysis. Data from <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> assays showed that FcFNSII-2 directly synthesized apigenin and acacetin from naringenin and isosakuranetin, respectively, whereas <i>FcFNSII-1</i> showed no detectable catalytic activities with flavanones. In agreement, transient overexpression of <i>FcFNSII-2</i> in kumquat peels significantly enhanced the transcription of structural genes of the flavonoid-biosynthesis pathway and the accumulation of several <i>O</i>-glycosyl flavones. Moreover, studying the subcellular localizations of FcFNSII-1 and FcFNSII-2 demonstrated that N-terminal membrane-spanning domains were necessary to ensure endoplasmic reticulum localization and anchoring. Protein-protein interaction analyses, using the split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system and bimolecular fluorescence-complementation assays, revealed that FcFNSII-2 interacted with chalcone synthase 1, chalcone synthase 2, and chalcone isomerase-like proteins. The results provide strong evidence that FcFNSII-2 serves as a nucleation site for an <i>O</i>-glycosyl flavone metabolon that channels flavanones for <i>O</i>-glycosyl flavone biosynthesis in kumquat fruits. They have implications for guiding genetic engineering efforts aimed at enhancing the composition of bioactive flavonoids in kumquat fruits.
