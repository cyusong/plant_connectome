Variations in the quality of wheat kernels can be an important problem in the cereal industry. In particular, desiccation conditions play an essential role in both the technological characteristics of the kernel and its ability to sprout. In planta desiccation constitutes a key stage in the determinism of the functional properties of seeds. The impact of desiccation on the endosperm texture of seed is presented in this work. A simple imaging system had previously been developed to acquire multivariate images to characterize the heterogeneity of food materials. A special algorithm for the use under principal component analysis (PCA) was developed to process the acquired multivariate images. Wheat grains were collected at physiological maturity, and were subjected to two types of drying conditions that induced different kinetics of water loss. A data set containing 24 images (dimensioned 702 × 524 pixels) corresponding to the different desiccation stages of wheat kernels was acquired at different wavelengths and then analyzed. A comparison of the images of kernel sections highlighted changes in kernel texture as a function of their drying conditions. Slow drying led to a floury texture, whereas fast drying caused a glassy texture. The automated imaging system thus developed is sufficiently rapid and economical to enable the characterization in large collections of grain texture as a function of time and water content.
