Considering the importance of blast caused by Pyricularia oryzae in the decrease of rice yield worldwide, this study aimed to assess the photosynthetic performance [leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence parameters as well as the photosynthetic pigments concentration], the activities of antioxidant enzymes [ascorbate peroxidase, catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase] and concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the leaves of rice plants non-supplied (-Glu) or supplied (+Glu) with glutamate (Glu) and non-infected or infected by P. oryzae. Blast severity was reduced in the leaves of +Glu plants. On the infected leaves of +Glu plants, the values for internal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration were lower while the values for net carbon assimilation rate, stomatal conductance as well as for the concentrations of Chl a, Chl b and carotenoids were higher in comparison to infected leaves of -Glu plants. The functionality of the photosynthetic apparatus was preserved in the infected leaves of +Glu plants. The activities of CAT, GPX, GR, POX and SOD increased in the infected leaves of both -Glu and +Glu plants compared to their non-inoculated counterparts, but their activities were lower for +Glu plants. The lower activity of these antioxidative enzymes was triggered by the reduced hydrogen peroxide concentration in the infected leaves of +Glu plants resulting in lower MDA concentration. It can be concluded that photosynthesis was less impaired in infected plants supplied with glutamate due to the lower biochemical constraints for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Moreover, there was a need for lower activity of reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes in infected leaves of plants supplied with glutamate due to the lower oxidative stress imposed by P. oryzae infection.
