['25218132', 'Di19 (drought-induced protein19) family is a novel type of Cys2/His2 zinc-finger  proteins. In this study, Arabidopsis Di19-3 was functionally characterized. The  experimental results revealed that AtDi19-3 is a transcriptional activator, and  could bind to the TACA(A/G)T sequence. AtDi19-3 expression in plants was  remarkably induced by NaCl, mannitol and abscisic acid (ABA). T-DNA insertion  mutation of AtDi19-3 results in an increase in plant tolerance to drought and  high salinity stresses and ABA, whereas overexpression of AtDi19-3 leads to a  drought-, salt- and ABA-sensitive phenotype of the transgenic plants. In the  presence of NaCl, mannitol or ABA, rates of seed germination and cotyledon  greening in Atdi19-3 mutant were higher, but in AtDi19-3 overexpression  transgenic plants were lower than those in wild type. Roots of Atdi19-3 mutant  seedlings were longer, but those of AtDi19-3 overexpression transgenic seedlings  were shorter than those of wild type. Chlorophyll and proline contents in  Atdi19-3 mutant were higher, but in AtDi19-3 overexpression seedlings were lower  than those in wild type. Atdi19-3 mutant showed greater drought-tolerance,  whereas AtDi19-3 overexpression transgenic plants exhibited more  drought-sensitivity than wild type. Furthermore, expression of the genes related  to ABA signaling pathway was altered in Atdi19-3 mutant and AtDi19-3 transgenic  plants. These data suggest that AtDi19-3 may participate in plant response to  drought and salt stresses in an ABA-dependent manner.', '2014 Dec', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-014-0251-4', 'Li']
