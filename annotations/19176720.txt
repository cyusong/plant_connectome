Low-oxygen stress imposed by field waterlogging is a serious impediment to plant germination and growth. Plants respond to waterlogging with a complex set of physiological responses regulated at the transcriptional, cellular, and tissue levels. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) NAC domain-containing gene ANAC102 was shown to be induced under 0.1% oxygen within 30 min in both roots and shoots as well as in 0.1% oxygen-treated germinating seeds. Overexpression of ANAC102 altered the expression of a number of genes, including many previously identified as being low-oxygen responsive. Decreasing ANAC102 expression had no effect on global gene transcription in plants but did alter expression patterns in low-oxygen-stressed seeds. Increasing or decreasing the expression of ANAC102 did not affect adult plant survival of low-oxygen stress. Decreased ANAC102 expression significantly decreased germination efficiency following a 0.1% oxygen treatment, but increased expression had no effect on germination. This protective role during germination appeared to be specific to low-oxygen stress, implicating ANAC102 as an important regulator of seed germination under flooding.
