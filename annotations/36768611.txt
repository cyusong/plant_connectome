The <i>BES1</i> (BRI1-EMSSUPPRESSOR1) gene family play a vital role in the BR (brassinosteroid) signaling pathway, which is involved in the growth and development, biotic, abiotic, and hormone stress response in many plants. However, there are few reports of <i>BES1</i> in <i>Cucurbita moschata</i>. In this study, 50 <i>BES1</i> genes were identified in six Cucurbitaceae species by genome-wide analysis, which could be classified into 3 groups according to their gene structural features and motif compositions, and 13 <i>CmoBES1</i> genes in <i>Cucurbita moschata</i> were mapped on 10 chromosomes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the <i>CmoBES1</i> genes displayed differential expression under different abiotic stress and hormone treatments. Subcellular localization showed that the most of CmoBES1 proteins localized in nucleus and cytoplasm, and transactivation assay indicated 9 CmoBES1 proteins played roles as transcription factors. Our analysis of BES1s diversity, localization, and expression in Curcubitaceae contributes to the better understanding of the essential roles of these transcription factors in plants.
