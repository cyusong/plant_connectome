['24130159', "Purine nucleotide catabolism is common to most organisms and involves a guanine  deaminase to convert guanine to xanthine in animals, invertebrates, and  microorganisms. Using metabolomic analysis of mutants, we demonstrate that  Arabidopsis thaliana uses an alternative catabolic route employing a highly  specific guanosine deaminase (GSDA) not reported from any organism so far. The  enzyme is ubiquitously expressed and deaminates exclusively guanosine and  2'-deoxyguanosine but no other aminated purines, pyrimidines, or pterines. GSDA  belongs to the cytidine/deoxycytidylate deaminase family of proteins together  with a deaminase involved in riboflavin biosynthesis, the chloroplastic tRNA  adenosine deaminase Arg and a predicted tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase 2 in A.  thaliana. GSDA is conserved in plants, including the moss Physcomitrella patens,  but is absent in the algae and outside the plant kingdom. Our data show that  xanthosine is exclusively generated through the deamination of guanosine by GSDA  in A. thaliana, excluding other possible sources like the dephosphorylation of  xanthosine monophosphate. Like the nucleoside hydrolases NUCLEOSIDE HYDROLASE1  (NSH1) and NSH2, GSDA is located in the cytosol, indicating that GMP catabolism  to xanthine proceeds in a mostly cytosolic pathway via guanosine and xanthosine.  Possible implications for the biosynthetic route of purine alkaloids (caffeine  and theobromine) and ureides in other plants are discussed.", '2013 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.117184', 'Witte']
