Plants respond flexibly to changes in temperature. A new study shows that a small electrophilic, lipid-derived molecule protects both land plants and streptophyte algae from high temperature. This suggests that a mechanism of thermal signalling was present in the common ancestor of the land plants and streptophyte algae.
