Different peroxidases, including 2-cysteine (2-Cys) peroxiredoxins (PRXs) and thylakoid ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX), have been proposed to be involved in the water-water cycle (WWC) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated signaling in plastids. We generated an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) double-mutant line deficient in the two plastid 2-Cys PRXs (2-Cys PRX A and B, 2cpa 2cpb) and a triple mutant deficient in 2-Cys PRXs and tAPX (2cpa 2cpb tapx). In contrast to wild-type and tapx single-knockout plants, 2cpa 2cpb double-knockout plants showed an impairment of photosynthetic efficiency and became photobleached under high light (HL) growth conditions. In addition, double-mutant plants also generated elevated levels of superoxide anion radicals, H2O2, and carbonylated proteins but lacked anthocyanin accumulation under HL stress conditions. Under HL conditions, 2-Cys PRXs seem to be essential in maintaining the WWC, whereas tAPX is dispensable. By comparison, this HL-sensitive phenotype was more severe in 2cpa 2cpb tapx triple-mutant plants, indicating that tAPX partially compensates for the loss of functional 2-Cys PRXs by mutation or inactivation by overoxidation. In response to HL, H2O2- and photooxidative stress-responsive marker genes were found to be dramatically up-regulated in 2cpa 2cpb tapx but not 2cpa 2cpb mutant plants, suggesting that HL-induced plastid to nucleus retrograde photooxidative stress signaling takes place after loss or inactivation of the WWC enzymes 2-Cys PRX A, 2-Cys PRX B, and tAPX.

tAPX: !partially compensates for! loss of functional 2-Cys PRXs
HL: !induces! plastid to nucleus retrograde photooxidative stress signaling
H2O2: !up-regulates! marker genes
