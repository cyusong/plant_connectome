Plasma membrane anion transporters play fundamental roles in plant cell biology, especially in stomatal closure and nutrition. Notwithstanding, a lot is still unknown about the specific function of these transporters, their specific localization, or molecular nature. Here the fundamental roles of anionic transport in plant cells are reviewed. Special attention will be paid to them in the control of pollen tube growth. Pollen tubes are extreme examples of cellular polarity as they grow exclusively in their apical extremity. Their unique cell biology has been extensively exploited for fundamental understanding of cellular growth and morphogenesis. Non-invasive methods have demonstrated that tube growth is governed by different ion fluxes, with different properties and distribution. Not much is known about the nature of the membrane transporters responsible for anionic transport and their regulation in the pollen tube. Recent data indicate the importance of chloride (Cl(-)) transfer across the plasma membrane for pollen germination and pollen tube growth. A general overview is presented of the well-known accumulated data in terms of biophysical and functional characterization, transcriptomics, and genomic description of pollen ionic transport, and the various controversies around the role of anionic fluxes during pollen tube germination, growth, and development. It is concluded that, like all other plant cells so far analysed, pollen tubes depend on anion fluxes for a number of fundamental homeostatic properties.
