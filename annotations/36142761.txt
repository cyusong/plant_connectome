The heat shock protein 20 (HSP20) proteins comprise an ancient, diverse, and crucial family of proteins that exists in all organisms. As a family, the HSP20s play an obvious role in thermotolerance, but little is known about their molecular functions in addition to heat acclimation. In this study, 42 <i>PpHSP20</i> genes were detected in the peach genome and were randomly distributed onto the eight chromosomes. The primary modes of gene duplication of the PpHSP20s were dispersed gene duplication (DSD) and tandem duplication (TD). PpHSP20s in the same class shared similar motifs. Based on phylogenetic analysis of HSP20s in peach, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Glycine max,</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i>, the PpHSP20s were classified into 11 subclasses, except for two unclassified PpHSP20s. <i>cis</i>-elements related to stress and hormone responses were detected in the promoter regions of most PpHSP20s. Gene expression analysis of 42 <i>PpHSP20</i> genes revealed that the expression pattern of <i>PpHSP20-32</i> was highly consistent with shoot length changes in the cultivar 'Zhongyoutao 14', which is a temperature-sensitive semi-dwarf. <i>PpHSP20-32</i> was selected for further functional analysis. The plant heights of three transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing PpHSP20-32 were significantly higher than WT, although there was no significant difference in the number of nodes. In addition, the seeds of three over-expressing lines of PpHSP20-32 treated with high temperature showed enhanced thermotolerance. These results provide a foundation for the functional characterization of <i>PpHSP20</i> genes and their potential use in the growth and development of peach.
