['17485080', 'Although decapping is an important process in eukaryotic mRNA turnover, little is  known about this process in plants. Here, we identified Arabidopsis thaliana  decapping proteins AtDCP1 and AtDCP2 and showed that (I) AtDCP2 is an active  decapping enzyme, (II) AtDCP1 interacts with itself, (III) AtDCP1 and AtDCP2 are  localized to cytoplasmic foci (putative Arabidopsis processing body), and (IV)  AtDCP1 and AtDCP2 are essential for post-embryonic development. Our findings  provide new insights into the role of decapping-dependent mRNA turnover.', '2007 May 29', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2007.04.051', 'Watanabe']
