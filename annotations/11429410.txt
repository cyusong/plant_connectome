['11429410', 'Galactolipids make up the bulk of chloroplast lipids. Therefore, the genes  involved in the synthesis of the galactolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol  (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) play a critical role in chloroplast  development. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the  Arabidopsis DGDG synthase DGD1, which was recently identified by complementation  of the Arabidopsis dgd1 mutant. In vitro import experiments demonstrated that  DGD1 was targeted to the chloroplast outer envelope in an ATP-independent manner.  DGD1 could not be extracted from the membranes by high salt or alkali, suggesting  that it is an integral membrane protein. Uptake experiments with truncated  versions of DGD1 indicated that the information for targeting and insertion into  the outer envelope resides in the N-terminal half of DGD1, but not in the first  33 amino acids. DGD1 apparently does not contain a cleavable signal peptide.  Antibodies to Arabidopsis DGD1 detected a 90-kDa protein localized to the  chloroplast envelopes of both pea and Arabidopsis. Transformation of DGD1  constructs into cyanobacteria resulted in the expression of active DGDG synthase  and demonstrated that DGDG synthesis depends on MGDG lipid, but does not require  direct interaction with the plant MGDG synthase.', '2001 Aug 24', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M104652200', 'Dormann']
