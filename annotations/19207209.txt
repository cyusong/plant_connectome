['19207209', 'LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC1) plays vital roles in the regulation of seed maturation  in Arabidopsis. LEC1 encodes a homolog of yeast HAP3 or mammalian NF-YB/CBF-A  subunit of trimeric CCAAT binding factor (CBF). Among the nine paralogs of NF-YB  in Arabidopsis, LEC1-LIKE (L1L) is most closely related to LEC1, and can  complement the lec1 mutation when expressed under the control of the LEC1  promoter. Although the nature of the B3-type seed maturation regulators as  transcription factors have been investigated, knowledge of the molecular action  of LEC1 is limited. When co-expressed with NF-YC2 in the presence of ABA, we  found that LEC1 or L1L, but not other NF-YBs, activated the promoter of  CRUCIFERIN C (CRC), which encodes a seed storage protein. However, additional  expression of an NF-YA subunit interfered with the activation. The  LEC1/L1L-[NF-YC2] activation depended on ABA-response elements present in the  promoter, which led to the finding that LEC1/L1L-[NF-YC2] can strongly activate  the CRC promoter in the absence of ABA when co-expressed with a seed-specific  ABA-response element (ABRE)-binding factor, bZIP67. Functional coupling of  LEC1/L1L-[AtNF-YC2] and bZIP67 was also observed in the regulation of sucrose  synthase 2 (SUS2). Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that L1L and bZIP67  formed a protein complex in vivo. These results demonstrate a novel  plant-specific mechanism for NF-Y subunit function that enables LEC1 and L1L to  regulate a defined developmental network.', '2009 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03817.x', 'Hattori']
