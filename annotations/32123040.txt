RNA splicing is a fundamental mechanism contributing to the definition of the cellular protein population in any given environmental condition. DNA-DAMAGE REPAIR/TOLERATION PROTEIN111 (DRT111)/SPLICING FACTOR FOR PHYTOCHROME SIGNALING is a splicing factor previously shown to interact with phytochrome B and characterized for its role in splicing of pre-mRNAs involved in photomorphogenesis. Here, we show that DRT111 interacts with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Splicing Factor1, involved in 3' splicing site recognition. Double- and triple-mutant analysis shows that DRT111 controls splicing of <i>ABI3</i> and acts upstream of the splicing factor SUPPRESSOR OF ABI3-ABI5. <i>DRT111</i> is highly expressed in seeds and stomata of Arabidopsis and is induced by long-term treatments of polyethylene glycol and abscisic acid (ABA). <i>DRT111</i> knock-out mutants are defective in ABA-induced stomatal closure and are hypersensitive to ABA during seed germination. Conversely, <i>DRT111</i> overexpressing plants show ABA-hyposensitive seed germination. RNA-sequencing experiments show that in dry seeds, DRT111 controls expression and splicing of genes involved in osmotic-stress and ABA responses, light signaling, and mRNA splicing, including targets of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs). Consistently, expression of the germination inhibitor <i>SOMNUS</i>, induced by ABI3 and PIF1, is upregulated in imbibed seeds of <i>drt111</i>-<i>2</i> mutants. Together, these results indicate that DRT111 controls sensitivity to ABA during seed development, germination, and stomatal movements, and integrates ABA- and light-regulated pathways to control seed germination.
