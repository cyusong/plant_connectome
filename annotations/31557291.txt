The distribution of type I and II chalcone isomerases (CHIs) in plants is highly family specific. We have previously reported that ancient land plants, such as the liverworts and Selaginella moellendorffii, harbor type II CHIs. To better understand the function and evolution of CHI-fold proteins, transcriptomic data obtained from 52 pteridophyte species were subjected to sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. The residues determining type I/II CHI identity in the pteridophyte CHIs were identical to those of type I CHIs. The enzymatic characterization of a sample of 24 CHIs, representing all the key pteridophyte lineages, demonstrated that 19 of them were type I enzymes and that five exhibited some type II activity due to an amino acid mutation. Two pteridophyte chalcone synthases (CHSs) were also characterized, and a type IV CHI (CHIL) was demonstrated to interact physically with CHSs and CHI, and to increase CHS activity by decreasing derailment products, thus enhancing flavonoid production. These findings suggest that the emergence of type I CHIs may have coincided with the divergence of the pteridophytes. This study deepens our understanding of the molecular mechanism of CHIL as an enhancer in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway.
