Tillandsia usneoides in epiphytic bromeliads takes up water through absorptive trichomes on the shoot surface under extreme environmental conditions. Although previous studies revealed the way by which T. usneoides absorbs water and prevents water loss, its water transport remains unclear. We characterized structures of trichome wings of T. usneoides. Wing length-to-thickness ratio of 136 and trichome interval (d)-to-wing length (l) ratio (d/l) smaller than 1 caused the water film to flatten the wings sequentially, resulting in domino-like water transport. A hinge-like linkage between wing and outer ring cells and the wing size longer than the elastocapillary length (L<sub>EC</sub> ) brought about this unique reconfiguration, which is the flattening and recovery of wings. Tillandsia usneoides transported water rapidly on the surface as the water film propagated on the exterior trichomes with flexible wings and the transport distance at the macroscopic scale grew as t<sup>x</sup> with x = 0.68 ± 0.04, unlike the conventional scaling of t<sup>0.5</sup> . Empirical and theoretical investigations proved our assumption that external water transport with the domino-like effect predominated over internal vascular transport. Biomimetic trichome wings simulated the domino-like water transport, highlighting the important role of flexible wing arrays.
