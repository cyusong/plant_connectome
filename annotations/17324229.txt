Quercus robur L. is a mid-European broadleaved tree species that grows readily on temporary waterlogged soils. An experiment aiming to identify potential markers of tolerance to waterlogging in this species and to assess the degree of genetic control over the corresponding traits was conducted. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were assessed in an F(1) progeny for responses to waterlogging, and the relevance of the observed traits as markers of tolerance was investigated using a precise description of the time course of their expression. Five significant QTL involved in the response to waterlogging were identified. In particular, QTL were detected for the development of hypertrophied lenticels and for the degree of leaf epinasty, but not for the formation of adventitious roots. A multi-environment QTL model allowed a detailed description of the time course (7 weeks) of the allelic substitution effect of some of these QTL. Correlation clustering identified significant clusters of QTL, at inter-trait as well as at intra-trait level. These clusters suggest the occurrence of a genetically controlled response cascade to waterlogging.
