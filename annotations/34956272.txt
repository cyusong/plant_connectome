Maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) is a tropical crop, and low temperature has become one of the main abiotic stresses for maize growth and development, affecting many maize growth processes. The main area of maize production in China, Jilin province, often suffers from varying degrees of cold damage in spring, which seriously affects the quality and yield of maize. In the face of global climate change and food security concerns, discovering cold tolerance genes, developing cold tolerance molecular markers, and creating cold-tolerant germplasm have become urgent for improving maize resilience against these conditions and obtaining an increase in overall yield. In this study, whole-genome sequencing and genotyping by sequencing were used to perform genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of the two populations, respectively. Overall, four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 12 QTLs were found to be significantly associated with cold tolerance. Through joint analysis, an intersection of GWAS and QTL mapping was found on chromosome 3, on which the <i>Zm00001d002729</i> gene was identified as a potential factor in cold tolerance. We verified the function of this target gene through overexpression, suppression of expression, and genetic transformation into maize. We found that <i>Zm00001d002729</i> overexpression resulted in better cold tolerance in this crop. The identification of genes associated with cold tolerance contributes to the clarification of the underlying mechanism of this trait in maize and provides a foundation for the adaptation of maize to colder environments in the future, to ensure food security.
