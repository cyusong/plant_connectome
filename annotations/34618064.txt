Development of multicellular organisms is a complex process involving precise coordination of growth among individual cells. Understanding organogenesis requires measurements of cellular behaviors over space and time. In plants, such a quantitative approach has been successfully used to dissect organ development in both leaves and external floral organs, such as sepals. However, the observation of floral reproductive organs is hampered as they develop inside tightly closed floral buds, and are therefore difficult to access for imaging. We developed a confocal time-lapse imaging method, applied here to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which allows full quantitative characterization of the development of stamens, the male reproductive organs. Our lineage tracing reveals the early specification of the filament and the anther. Formation of the anther lobes is associated with a temporal increase of growth at the lobe surface that correlates with intensive growth of the developing locule. Filament development is very dynamic and passes through three distinct phases: (1) initial intense, anisotropic growth, and high cell proliferation; (2) restriction of growth and proliferation to the filament proximal region; and (3) resumption of intense and anisotropic growth, displaced to the distal portion of the filament, without cell proliferation. This quantitative atlas of cellular growth dynamics provides a solid framework for future studies into stamen development.
