['22781128', 'Phototropism allows plants to redirect their growth towards the light to optimize  photosynthesis under reduced light conditions. Phototropin 1 (phot1) is the  primary low blue light-sensing receptor triggering phototropism in Arabidopsis.  Light-induced autophosphorylation of phot1, an AGC-class protein kinase,  constitutes an essential step for phototropism. However, apart from the receptor  itself, substrates of phot1 kinase activity are less clearly established.  Phototropism is also influenced by the cryptochromes and phytochromes  photoreceptors that do not provide directional information but influence the  process through incompletely characterized mechanisms. Here, we show that  Phytochrome Kinase Substrate 4 (PKS4), a known element of phot1 signalling, is a  substrate of phot1 kinase activity in vitro that is phosphorylated in a  phot1-dependent manner in vivo. PKS4 phosphorylation is transient and regulated  by a type 2-protein phosphatase. Moreover, phytochromes repress the accumulation  of the light-induced phosphorylated form of PKS4 showing a convergence of  photoreceptor activity on this signalling element. Our physiological analyses  suggest that PKS4 phosphorylation is not essential for phototropism but is part  of a negative feedback mechanism.', '2012 Aug 15', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2012.186', 'Fankhauser']
