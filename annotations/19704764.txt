The symbiotic interaction between the soil bacteria Frankia and actinorhizal plants leads to the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules resembling modified lateral roots. Little is known about the signals exchanged between the two partners during the establishment of these endosymbioses. However, a role for plant hormones has been suggested.Recently, we studied the role of auxin influx activity during actinorhizal symbioses. An inhibitor of auxin influx was shown to perturb nodule formation. Moreover we identified a functional auxin influx carrier that is produced specifically in Frankia-infected cells. These results together with previous data showing auxin production by Frankia lead us to propose a model of auxin action during the symbiotic infection process.

Frankia: !produces! auxin 
auxin: !inhibits! nodule formation 
auxin: !carried by! auxin influx carrier 
Frankia: !produces! auxin influx carrier
