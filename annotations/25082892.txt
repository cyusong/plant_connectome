Comparative genomics analysis unravels lineage-specific bursts of gene duplications related to the emergence of specialized pathways. The CYP76C subfamily of cytochrome P450 enzymes is specific to Brassicaceae. Two of its members were recently associated with monoterpenol metabolism. This prompted us to investigate the CYP76C subfamily genetic and functional diversification. Our study revealed high rates of CYP76C gene duplication and loss in Brassicaceae, suggesting the association of the CYP76C subfamily with species-specific adaptive functions. Gene differential expression and enzyme functional specialization in Arabidopsis thaliana, including metabolism of different monoterpenols and formation of different products, support this hypothesis. In addition to linalool metabolism, CYP76C1, CYP76C2, and CYP76C4 metabolized herbicides belonging to the class of phenylurea. Their ectopic expression in the whole plant conferred herbicide tolerance. CYP76Cs from A. thaliana. thus provide a first example of promiscuous cytochrome P450 enzymes endowing effective metabolism of both natural and xenobiotic compounds. Our data also suggest that the CYP76C gene family provides a suitable genetic background for a quick evolution of herbicide resistance.
