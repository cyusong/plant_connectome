['17551013', 'FRET is a well established method for cellular and subcellular imaging of protein  interactions. However, FRET obligatorily necessitates fluorescence excitation  with its concomitant problems of photobleaching, autofluorescence, phototoxicity,  and undesirable stimulation of photobiological processes. A sister technique,  bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), avoids these problems because  it uses enzyme-catalyzed luminescence; however, BRET signals usually have been  too dim to image effectively in the past. Using a new generation electron  bombardment-charge-coupled device camera coupled to an image splitter, we  demonstrate that BRET can be used to image protein interactions in plant and  animal cells and in tissues; even subcellular imaging is possible. We have  applied this technology to image two different protein interactions: (i)  dimerization of the developmental regulator, COP1, in plant seedlings; and (ii)  CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) in the mammalian nucleus. This  advance heralds a host of applications for imaging without fluorescent excitation  and its consequent limitations.', '2007 Jun 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0701987104', 'Johnson']
