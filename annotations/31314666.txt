We recently demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) accumulation and <i>PHYTOGB1</i> transcriptional regulation are early components of the regulatory pathway that is activated in tomato roots during the onset of the mycorrhizal symbiosis between <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> and tomato roots. We further showed that the mycorrhizal interaction was associated with a specific NO-related signature, different from that triggered by the pathogen <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>. Here, we extend our investigation by exploring the NO- and <i>PHYTOGB1-</i>related root responses elicited by another root mutualistic endosymbiotic fungus: <i>Trichoderma harzianum</i> T-78. By using T-78 <i>in vitro</i>-grown cultures, we found that T-78 triggered an early and transient burst of NO in tomato roots during the first hours after the interaction. T-78 also elicited the early upregulation of <i>PHYTOGB1</i>, which was maintained during the analyzed timespan. By using glass-house bioassays, we found that in a well-established tomato-T-78 symbiosis, NO root levels were maintained at basal level while <i>PHYTOGB1</i> expression remained upregulated. Our results demonstrate that the T-78 symbiosis is associated with a rapid and transient burst of NO in the host roots and the transcriptional activation of <i>PHYTOGB1</i> from early stages of the interaction until the establishment of the symbiosis, most likely to control NO levels and favor the mutualistic symbiosis.
