Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for plants and animals. Because of its low availability in arable soils worldwide, Zn deficiency is becoming a serious agricultural problem resulting in decreases of crop yield and nutritional quality. Plants have evolved multiple responses to adapt to low levels of soil Zn supply, involving biochemical and physiological changes to improve Zn acquisition and utilization, and defend against Zn deficiency stress. In this review, we summarize the physiological and biochemical adaptations of plants to Zn deficiency, the roles of transporters and metal-binding compounds in Zn homeostasis regulation, and the recent progresses in understanding the sophisticated regulatory mechanisms of Zn deficiency responses that have been made by molecular and genetic analyses, as well as diverse 'omics' studies. Zn deficiency responses are tightly controlled by multiple layers of regulation, such as transcriptional regulation that is mediated by transcription factors like F-group bZIP proteins, epigenetic regulation at the level of chromatin, and post-transcriptional regulation mediated by small RNAs and alternative splicing. The insights into the regulatory network underlying Zn deficiency responses and the perspective for further understandings of molecular regulation of Zn deficiency responses have been discussed. The understandings of the regulatory mechanisms will be important for improving Zn deficiency tolerance, Zn use efficiency, and Zn biofortification in plants.
