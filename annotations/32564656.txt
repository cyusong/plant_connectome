Earlier, we reported that Arabidopsis young lateral roots (LR) exhibited improved lethal salinity tolerance as compared with the primary root (PR). We have shown that cell death processes which take place in the PR during salt stress are postponed in the LR. Still, very little is known about the regulation of cell survival mechanisms in the LR during salinity stress. Here we used transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing Cyclin B1;1:GUS, to further study the responses to salinity in the PR and LR positions. We found strong Cyclin B1;1:GUS activity in young budding LR of salt stressed and stress recovered plants. The Cyclin B1;1:GUS activity dropped significantly in long LR and was almost completely abolished in the PR. Our data provides another line of evidence that position-dependent response occurs in Arabidopsis roots during lethal salinity. The possible roles Cyclin B1;1 plays in the young LR during the response to lethal salinity are discussed.

Cyclin B1;1: !enhances! LR survival 
LR: !postpones! cell death 
Cyclin B1;1: !abolishes! PR activity 
PR: !exhibits! lethal salinity tolerance
