Genes at the maize Rp1 rust resistance complex often mispair in meiosis, which allows genes to recombine unequally, creating recombinant haplotypes. Four recombinant haplotypes were identified from progeny of an Rp1-D/Rp1-I heterozygote that conferred a nonparental resistance specificity designated Rp1-I*. Sequence comparisons of paralogs in the recombinant and parental haplotypes demonstrated that all four recombinants were derived from intergenic (between gene) recombination events. The sequence of paralogs in the HRp1-I parental haplotype indicated this haplotype includes 41 or more rp1 genes, at least 31 of which are transcribed. The results indicate that most of the novel resistance specificities that have arisen spontaneously at Rp1 are the result of reassort ment of existing Rp1 genes.
