['22209765', 'Here, we identify Arabidopsis thaliana Lumen Thiol Oxidoreductase1 (LTO1) as a  disulfide bond-forming enzyme in the thylakoid lumen. Using topological reporters  in bacteria, we deduced a lumenal location for the redox active domains of the  protein. LTO1 can partially substitute for the proteins catalyzing disulfide bond  formation in the bacterial periplasm, which is topologically equivalent to the  plastid lumen. An insertional mutation within the LTO1 promoter is associated  with a severe photoautotrophic growth defect. Measurements of the photosynthetic  activity indicate that the lto1 mutant displays a limitation in the electron flow  from photosystem II (PSII). In accordance with these measurements, we noted a  severe depletion of the structural subunits of PSII but no change in the  accumulation of the cytochrome b(6)f complex or photosystem I. In a yeast  two-hybrid assay, the thioredoxin-like domain of LTO1 interacts with PsbO, a  lumenal PSII subunit known to be disulfide bonded, and a recombinant form of the  molecule can introduce a disulfide bond in PsbO in vitro. The documentation of a  sulfhydryl-oxidizing activity in the thylakoid lumen further underscores the  importance of catalyzed thiol-disulfide chemistry for the biogenesis of the  thylakoid compartment.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.089680', 'Hamel']
