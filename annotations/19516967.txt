Hemoglobins are ancient O(2)-binding proteins, ubiquitously found in eukaryotes. They have been categorized as symbiotic, nonsymbiotic and truncated hemoglobins. We have investigated the cellular localization of nonsymbiotic hemoglobin proteins during somatic embryogenesis in Cichorium hybrid leaves (Cichorium intybus L. var. sativum x C. endivia var. latifolia) using immunolocalization technique. These proteins were detected during the two steps of culture: induction and expression. In leaves, hemoglobins colocalised with plastids, which were dispersed in the parietal cytoplasm as well as in the two guard cells of a stomata, but not in epidermis cells. Upon induction of embryogenesis, in the dark, this pattern disappeared. During the induction phase, where competent cells reinitiate the cell cycle and prepare for mitosis, hemoglobins appeared initially near chloroplasts, and then in the vicinity of vascular vessels especially in the phloem and in cells surrounding the xylem vessels. When leaf fragments were transferred to another medium for the expression phase, hemoglobins were observed in the majority of the leaf blade cells and in small young embryos but not in the older ones. Hemoglobins were also detected in other leaves cells or tissues all along the process. The role of these nonsymbiotic hemoglobins during somatic embryogenesis is discussed.
