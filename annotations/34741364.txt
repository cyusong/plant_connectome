Being sessile organisms, plants are ubiquitously exposed to stresses that can affect the DNA replication process or cause DNA damage. To cope with these problems, plants utilize DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, consisting of both highly conserved and plant-specific elements. As a part of this DDR, cell cycle checkpoint control mechanisms either pause the cell cycle, to allow DNA repair, or lead cells into differentiation or programmed cell death, to prevent the transmission of DNA errors in the organism through mitosis or to its offspring via meiosis. The two major DDR cell cycle checkpoints control either the replication process or the G2/M transition. The latter is largely overseen by the plant-specific SOG1 transcription factor, which drives the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and MYB3R proteins, which are rate limiting for the G2/M transition. By contrast, the replication checkpoint is controlled by different players, including the conserved kinase WEE1 and likely the transcriptional repressor RBR1. These checkpoint mechanisms are called upon during developmental processes, in retrograde signaling pathways, and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, including metal toxicity, cold, salinity, and phosphate deficiency. Additionally, the recent expansion of research from Arabidopsis to other model plants has revealed species-specific aspects of the DDR. Overall, it is becoming evidently clear that the DNA damage checkpoint mechanisms represent an important aspect of the adaptation of plants to a changing environment, hence gaining more knowledge about this topic might be helpful to increase the resilience of plants to climate change.
