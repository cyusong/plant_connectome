['24329768', '* Pseudomonas syringae type III effectors are known to suppress plant immunity to  promote bacterial virulence. However, the activities and targets of these  effectors are not well understood. * We used genetic, molecular, and cell biology  methods to characterize the activities, localization, and target of the HopD1  type III effector in Arabidopsis. * HopD1 contributes to P. syringae virulence in  Arabidopsis and reduces effector-triggered immunity (ETI) responses but not  pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) responses. Plants  expressing HopD1 supported increased growth of ETI-inducing P. syringae strains  compared with wild-type Arabidopsis. We show that HopD1 interacts with the  membrane-tethered Arabidopsis transcription factor NTL9 and demonstrate that this  interaction occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A P. syringae hopD1 mutant  and ETI-inducing P. syringae strains exhibited enhanced growth on Arabidopsis  ntl9 mutant plants. Conversely, growth of P. syringae strains was reduced in  plants expressing a constitutively active NTL9 derivative, indicating that NTL9  is a positive regulator of plant immunity. Furthermore, HopD1 inhibited the  induction of NTL9-regulated genes during ETI but not PTI. * HopD1 contributes to  P. syringae virulence in part by targeting NTL9, resulting in the suppression of  ETI responses but not PTI responses and the promotion of plant pathogenicity.', '2014 Mar', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.12626', 'Alfano']
