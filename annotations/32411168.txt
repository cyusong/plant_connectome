Argonaute 2 (AGO2)-mediated role in plant defense against fungal pathogens remains largely unknown. In this study, integrated miRNAome and transcriptome analysis employing <i>ago2</i> mutant was performed to reveal AGO2-associated miRNAs and defense responses against the devastating necrotrophic phytopathogen <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>. Both miRNAome and transcriptomes of <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>-inoculated <i>ago2-1</i> mutant (<i>ago2-Ss</i>) and wild-type (WT<i>-Ss</i>) as well as mock-inoculated <i>ago2-1</i> mutant (<i>ago2</i>) and wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis plants, were analyzed by sRNA and mRNA deep sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) of the comparisons WT<i>-Ss</i>/WT, <i>ago2</i>/WT, <i>ago2-Ss</i>/WT<i>-Ss</i>, and <i>ago2-Ss</i>/<i>ago2</i> were identified. Furthermore, integration analysis for the DEMs and DEGs identified over 40 potential AGO2-dependent <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>-responsive (ATSR) DEM-DEG pairs involving modulation of immune recognition, calcium flux, redox homeostasis, hormone accumulation and signaling, cell wall modification and metal ion homeostasis. Data-mining result indicated that most of the DEMs were bound with AGO2. Moreover, Arabidopsis mutant analysis demonstrated that three ROS and redox homeostatasis related DEGs of identified DEM-DEG pairs, <i>GSTU2</i>, <i>GSTU5</i>, and <i>RBOHF</i> contributed to the AGO2-mediated defense against <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>. This work provides genome-wide prediction of miRNA-target gene pairs that are potentially associated with the AGO2-dependent resistance against <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>.
