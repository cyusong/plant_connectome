Soybean is an important crop not only for human consumption but also for its addition of nitrogen to the soil during crop rotation. China has the largest collection of cultivated soybeans (Glycine max) and wild soybeans (Glycine soja) all over the world. The platform of soybean core, mini core and integrated applied core collections has been developed in the past decade based on systematic researches which included the sampling strategies, statistical methods, phenotypic data and SSR markers. Meanwhile, intergrated applied core collections including accessions with single or integrated favorite traits are being developed in order to meet the demand of soybean breeding. These kinds of core collections provide powerful materials for evaluation of germplasm, identification of trait-specific accessions, gene discovery, allele mining, genomic study, maker development, and molecular breeding. Some successful cases have proved the usefulness and efficiency of this platform. The platform is helpful for enhancing utilization of soybean genetic resources in sustainable crop improvement for food security. The efficient utilization of this platform in the future is relying on accurate phenotyping methods, abundant functional markers, high-throughput genotyping platforms, and effective breeding programs.
