Thousand-grain weight (TGW) is a very important yield trait of crops. In the present study, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of TGW in a doubled haploid population obtained from a cross between the bread wheat cultivar "Superb" and the breeding line "M321" using the wheat 55-k single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assay. A genetic map containing 15,001 SNP markers spanning 2209.64 cM was constructed, and 9 QTLs were mapped to chromosomes 1A, 2D, 4B, 4D, 5A, 5D, 6A, and 6D based on analyses conducted in six experimental environments during 2015-2017. The effects of the QTLs <i>qTgw.nwipb-4DS</i> and <i>qTgw.nwipb-</i><i>6AL</i> were shown to be strong and stable in different environments, explaining 15.31-32.43% and 21.34-29.46% of the observed phenotypic variance, and they were mapped within genetic distances of 2.609 cM and 5.256 cM, respectively. These novel QTLs may be used in marker-assisted selection in wheat high-yield breeding.
