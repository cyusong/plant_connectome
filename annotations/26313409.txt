The transition between seed dormancy and germination is an important stage that initiates plant life cycle. Hormonal balances of abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) contribute to determining the proper timing to germinate. Here, we demonstrate that the R2R3-type MYB96 transcription factor, a key ABA signaling mediator, coordinates seed dormancy and germination processes through distinct downstream events. This transcription factor controls ABA-INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4) expression to inhibit seed germination by suppressing breakdown of lipid reserves in embryo. In addition, it also induces seed dormancy by stimulating ABA biosynthesis in an ABI4-independent manner. We propose that MYB96 integrates a multitude of environmental stress signals and acts as a master regulator in the determination of timing for seed germination.
