Breeding of rice varieties that are enriched with essential micronutrients and simultaneously have reduced levels of toxic elements in grains is largely unexplored in rice breeding practice. In this issue of JIPB, Liu et al. (2020) developed two rice lines with a low level of cadmium and simultaneously high levels of zinc or selenium accumulation in the grains, thus providing elite genetic materials for breeding rice varieties that are important for addressing mineral malnutrition and ensuring food safety.
