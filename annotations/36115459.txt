Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are precursors to sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and plant cuticular waxes. In plants, members of a large 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) gene family catalyze the substrate-specific elongation of VLCFAs. Although it is well understood that KCSs have evolved to use diverse substrates, the underlying molecular determinants of their specificity are still unclear. In this study, we exploited the sequence similarity of a KCS gene cluster from Populus trichocarpa to examine the evolution and molecular determinants of KCS substrate specificity. Functional characterization of five members (PtKCS1, 2, 4, 8, 9) in yeast showed divergent product profiles based on VLCFA length, saturation, and position of the double bond. In addition, homology models, rationally designed chimeras, and site-directed mutants were used to identify two key regions (helix-4 and position 277) as being major determinants of substrate specificity. These results were corroborated with chimeras involving a more distantly related KCS, PtCER6 (the poplar ortholog of the Arabidopsis CER6), and used to show that helix-4 is necessary for the modulatory effect of PtCER2-like5 on KCS substrate specificity. The role of position 277 in limiting product length was further tested by substitution with smaller amino acids, which shifted specificity toward longer products. Finally, treatment with KCS inhibitors (K3 herbicides) showed varying inhibitor sensitivities between the duplicated paralogs despite their sequence similarity. Together, this work sheds light on the molecular mechanisms driving substrate diversification in the KCS family and lays the groundwork for tailoring the production of specific VLCFAs.
