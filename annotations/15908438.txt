In order to better understand the genetic regulation of secondary growth in hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L.xP. alba L.), we carried out a series of cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)-based transcriptome analyses in vertical stem segments that represent a gradient of developmental stages with regard to secondary growth. This approach allowed us to screen >80% of the transcriptome expressed in six samples and identify genes differentially expressed with the progress of secondary growth, in a tissue-specific manner. Of the 76,800 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) analyzed, 271 TDFs were selected and sequenced based on their differential expression patterns. Many of the xylem-up-regulated genes were involved in cell wall and lignin biosynthesis, while the bark-up-regulated genes had diverse functional roles. About 25% of the xylem-up-regulated TDFs analyzed were involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, which produces the cell wall polymer lignin and various wood extractives. In addition, many of the TDFs showing secondary xylem-specific expression were annotated as genes not previously reported in Populus, including novel cell death proteins, cytoskeleton-interacting proteins, transporters and putative transcription factors.
