['21398432', 'Arabidopsis thaliana hit1-1 is a heat-intolerant mutant. The HIT1 gene encodes a  protein that is homologous to yeast Vps53p, which is a subunit of the  Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex that is involved in retrograde  membrane trafficking to the Golgi. To investigate the correlation between the  cellular role of HIT1 and its protective function in heat tolerance in plants, it  was verified that HIT1 was co-localized with AtVPS52 and AtVPS54, the other  putative subunits of GARP, in the Golgi and post-Golgi compartments in  Arabidopsis protoplasts. A bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay showed  that HIT1 interacted with AtVPS52 and AtVPS54, which indicated their assembly  into a protein complex in vivo. Under heat stress conditions, the plasma membrane  of hit1-1 was less stable than that of the wild type, as determined by an  electrolyte leakage assay, and enhanced leakage occurred before peroxidation  injury to the membrane. In addition, the ability of hit1-1 to survive heat stress  was not influenced by exposure to light, which suggested that the heat  intolerance of hit-1 was a direct outcome of reduced membrane thermostability  rather than heat-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, hit1-1 was sensitive to  the duration (sustained high temperature stress at 37  degrees C for 3 d) but not the  intensity (heat shock at 44  degrees C for 30 min) of exposure to heat. Collectively,  these results imply that HIT1 functions in the membrane trafficking that is  involved in the thermal adaptation of the plasma membrane for tolerance to  long-term heat stress in plants.', '2011 Jun', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/err060', 'Wu']
