Sugar is considered as the primary regulator of plant apical dominance, whereby the outgrowth of axillary buds is inhibited by the shoot tip. However, there are some deficiencies in this theory. Here, we reveal that Fatty Acid Export 6 (BnFAX6) functions in FA transport, and linoleic acid or its derivatives acts as a signaling molecule in regulating apical dominance of Brassica napus. BnFAX6 is responsible for mediating FA export from plastids. Overexpression of BnFAX6 in B. napus heightened the expression of genes involved in glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis, promoting the flow of photosynthetic products to the biosynthesis of FAs (including linoleic acid and its derivatives). Enhancing expression of BnFAX6 increased oil content in seeds and leaves and resulted in semi-dwarf and increased branching phenotypes with more siliques, contributing to increased yield per plant relative to wild-type. Furthermore, decapitation led to the rapid flow of the carbon from photosynthetic products to FA biosynthesis in axillary buds, consistent with the overexpression of BnFAX6 in B. napus. In addition, free FAs, especially linoleic acid, were rapidly transported from leaves to axillary buds. Increasing linoleic acid in axillary buds repressed expression of a key transcriptional regulator responsible for maintaining bud dormancy, resulting in bud outgrowth. Taken together, we uncovered that BnFAX6 mediating FA export from plastids functions in lipid biosynthesis and in axillary bud dormancy release, possibly through enhancing linoleic acid level in axillary buds of B. napus.
