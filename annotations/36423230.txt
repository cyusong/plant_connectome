DNA acetylation alters the expression of responsive genes during plant development. In grapes (Vitis vinifera), however, little is known about this regulatory mechanism. In the present study, 'Kyoho' grapes treated with trichostatin A (TSA, a deacetylase inhibitor) were used for transcriptome sequencing and quantitative proteomics analysis. We observed that acetylation was associated with anthocyanin accumulation and gene expression. Acetylation positively regulated phenylalanine metabolism and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Using omics analysis, we detected an increase in the levels of the AP2/EREBP transcription factor family after TSA treatment, indicating its association with acetylation-deacetylation dynamics in grapes. Furthermore, ethylene response factor 4 (ERF4) physically interacted with VvHDAC19, a histone deacetylase, which synergistically reduced the expression of target genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis owing to the binding of VvERF4 to the GCC-box cis-regulatory element in the VvMYB5a promoter. VvHDAC19 and VvERF4 also controlled anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation by regulating acetylation levels of histones H3 and H4. Therefore, alterations in histone modification can significantly regulate the expression of genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis and affect grape ripening.
