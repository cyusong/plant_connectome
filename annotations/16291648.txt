['16291648', 'In flowering plants, development of the haploid male gametophytes (pollen grains)  takes place in a specialized structure called the anther. Successful pollen  development, and thus reproduction, requires high secretory activity in both  anther tissues and pollen. In this paper, we describe a novel member of the  eukaryotic type V subfamily (P(5)) of P-type ATPase cation pumps, the MALE  GAMETOGENESIS IMPAIRED ANTHERS (MIA) gene. MIA protein is highly abundant in the  endoplasmic reticulum and small vesicles of developing pollen grains and tapetum  cells. T-DNA insertional mutants of MIA suffer from imbalances in cation  homeostasis and exhibit a severe reduction in fertility. Mutant microspores fail  to separate from tetrads and pollen grains are fragile with an abnormal  morphology and altered cell wall structure. Disruption of MIA affects expression  of genes essential for secretion as well as a high number of genes encoding cell  wall proteins and membrane transporters. MIA functionally complements a mutant in  the P(5) ATPase homolog SPF1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting a common  function for P(5) ATPases in single and multicellular organisms. Our results  suggest that MIA is required in the secretory pathway for proper secretion of  vesicle cargo to the plasma membrane.', '2005 Nov 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.357305', 'Palmgren']
