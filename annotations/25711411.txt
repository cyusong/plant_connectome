['25711411', 'In this paper we describe PATTERN-TRIGGERED IMMUNITY (PTI) COMPROMISED  RECEPTOR-LIKE CYTOPLASMIC KINASE 1 (PCRK1) of Arabidopsis thaliana, an RLCK that  is important for defense against the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola  ES4326 (Pma ES4326). We examined defense responses such as bacterial growth,  production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and callose deposition in pcrk1  mutant plants to determine the role of PCRK1 during pathogen infection.  Expression of PCRK1 was induced following pathogen infection. Pathogen growth was  significantly higher in pcrk1 mutant lines than in wild-type Col-0. Mutant pcrk1  plants showed reduced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) against Pma ES4326 after  pretreatment with peptides derived from flagellin (flg22), elongation factor-Tu  (elf18), or an endogenous protein (pep1). Deposition of callose was reduced in  pcrk1 plants, indicating a role of PCRK1 in activation of early immune responses.  A PCRK1 transgene containing a mutation in a conserved lysine residue important  for phosphorylation activity of kinases (K118E) failed to complement a pcrk1  mutant for the Pma ES4326 growth phenotype. Our study shows that PCRK1 plays an  important role during PTI and that a conserved lysine residue in the putative  kinase domain is important for PCRK1 function.', '2015 Jul', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13345', 'Glazebrook']
