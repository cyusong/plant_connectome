The Arabidopsis plasma membrane-localized resistance protein RPM1 is degraded upon the induction of the hypersensitive response (HR) triggered in response to its own activation or that of other unrelated resistance (R) proteins. We investigated the role of RPM1 turnover in RPM1-mediated resistance and showed that degradation of RPM1 is not associated with HR or resistance mediated by this R protein. Likewise, the runaway cell death phenotype in the lsd1 mutant was not associated with RPM1 degradation and did not alter RPM1-derived resistance. RPM1 stability and RPM1-mediated resistance were dependent on the double-stranded RNA binding (DRB) proteins 1 and 4. Interestingly, the function of DRB1 in RPM1-mediated resistance was not associated with its role in pre-miRNA processing. The DRB3 and DRB5 proteins negatively regulated RPM1-mediated resistance and a mutation in these completely or partially restored resistance in the drb1, drb2, and drb4 mutant backgrounds. Conversely, plants overexpressing DRB5 showed attenuated RPM1-mediated resistance. A similar role for DRBs in basal and R-mediated resistance suggests that these proteins play a general role in bacterial resistance.
