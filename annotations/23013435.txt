The plant immune system encompasses an arsenal of defense genes that is activated upon recognition of a pathogen. Appropriate adjustment of gene expression is mediated by multiple interconnected signal transduction cascades that finally control the activity of transcription factors. These sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins act at the interface between the DNA and the regulatory protein network. In 1989, tobacco TGA1a was cloned as the first plant transcription factor. Since then, multiple studies have shown that members of the TGA family play important roles in defense responses against biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens and against chemical stress. Here, we review 22 years of research on TGA factors which have yielded both consistent and conflicting results.
