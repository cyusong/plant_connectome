Some AGP molecules or their sugar moieties are probably related to the guidance of the pollen tube into the embryo sac, in the final part of its pathway, when arriving at the ovules. The specific labelling of the synergid cells and its filiform apparatus, which are the cells responsible for pollen tube attraction, and also the specific labelling of the micropyle and micropylar nucellus, which constitutes the pollen tube entryway into the embryo sac, are quite indicative of this role. We also discuss the possibility that AGPs in the sperm cells are probably involved in the double fertilization process.

AGP: !guides! Pollen tube 
Synergid cells: !attracts! Pollen tube 
Micropyle/nucellus: !constitutes entryway! Pollen tube 
AGP: !involved in! Double fertilization
