The mycorrhizal traits of plants have been widely reported based on different scales or plant functional groups. To better utilize mycorrhizae to improve the cultivation yield and active ingredient accumulation of medicinal plants, a database of medicinal plant mycorrhizal characteristics is needed. A database on mycorrhizal traits including mycorrhizal type or status of Chinese medicinal plant species was assembled. In this study, the mycorrhizal type or status of a total of 3,230 medicinal plants was presented. Among them, the mycorrhizal traits of 1,321 species were ascertained. These medicinal plants had three mycorrhizal statuses, both single mycorrhiza (SM) and multi-mycorrhiza (MM) contained four mycorrhizal types. The majority of medicinal plants were obligatorily symbiotic with mycorrhizal fungi with 926 (70.10%) species. The most widespread mycorrhizal type is AM, which is associated with 842 medicinal plant species (90.93% of mycorrhiza has an obligatorily symbiotic relationship with Chinese medicinal plants). Another broadly studied mycorrhizal type is ECM, which is associated with 15 medicinal plant species. This study is the first exclusive database on mycorrhizal traits of medicinal plants, which provides both mycorrhizal type and status. This database provides valuable resources for identifying the mycorrhizal information of medicinal plants and enriching the theory of mycorrhizal traits, which will greatly benefit the production or management of medicinal plants.
