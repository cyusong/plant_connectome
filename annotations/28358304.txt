The glyoxalase system is the ubiquitous pathway for the detoxification of methylglyoxal (MG) in the biological systems. It comprises two enzymes, glyoxalase I (GLYI) and glyoxalase II (GLYII), which act sequentially to convert MG into d-lactate, thereby helping living systems get rid of this otherwise cytotoxic byproduct of metabolism. In addition, a glutathione-independent GLYIII enzyme activity also exists in the biological systems that can directly convert MG to d-lactate. Humans and <i>Escherichia coli</i> possess a single copy of <i>GLYI</i> (encoding either the Ni- or Zn-dependent form) and <i>GLYII</i> genes, which through MG detoxification provide protection against various pathological and disease conditions. By contrast, the plant genome possesses multiple <i>GLYI</i> and <i>GLYII</i> genes with a role in abiotic stress tolerance. Plants possess both Ni<sup>2+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent forms of GLYI, and studies on plant glyoxalases reveal the various unique features of these enzymes distinguishing them from prokaryotic and other eukaryotic glyoxalases. Through this review, we provide an overview of the plant glyoxalase family along with a comparative analysis of glyoxalases across various species, highlighting similarities as well as differences in the biochemical, molecular, and physiological properties of these enzymes. We believe that the evolution of multiple glyoxalases isoforms in plants is an important component of their robust defense strategies.
