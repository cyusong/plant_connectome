['20634427', 'RNA silencing in plants and some animals has a non-cell-autonomous effect due to  an RNA signal that moves between cells or organs. To identify unique factors  involved in this process, we analyzed a group of Arabidopsis mutants with  defective spread of RNA silencing from a transgene expressed specifically in the  phloem. These mutants accumulated reduced amounts of small interfering (si)RNA  from the transgene locus and from endogenous loci TAS1, TAS2, and an inverted  repeat locus IR71. The defect in TAS1 and TAS2 siRNA biogenesis is in the  processing of a long siRNA precursor. We mapped the mutations to a gene encoding  the Arabidopsis homolog of a protein, TEX1, which is involved in intracellular  transport of RNA in animals. TEX1 is a component of the THO/TREX complex, and we  show that the Arabidopsis TEX1 interacts with other predicted components of a  THO/TREX complex. Correspondingly, we found at least two other components of the  Arabidopsis THO core complex that are involved in RNA silencing. To reconcile the  effect of these mutations on transgene and endogenous gene siRNA, we propose a  mechanism in which THO/TREX processes or transports a long RNA molecule so that  it can be a template for secondary siRNA production.', '2010 Aug 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0911341107', 'Baulcombe']
