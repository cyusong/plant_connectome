Plant reproduction is the basis for economically relevant food production. It relies on pollen tube (PTs) growth into the female flower organs for successful fertilization. The high cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) at the PT tip is sensed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) that in turn activate R- and S-type anion channels to control polar growth. Lanthanum, a blocker for plant Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels was used here to demonstrate a strict dependency for anion channel activation through high PT tip [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>. We visualized this relationship by live-cell anion imaging and concurrent triggering of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-elevations with the two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) technique. The anion efflux provoked by a TEVC-triggered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> increase was abolished by Lanthanum and was followed by an overall rise in the cytosolic anion concentration. An interrelation between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and anion homeostasis occurred also on the transcript level of CPKs and anion channels. qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated a co-regulation of anion channels and CPKs in media with different Cl<sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> compositions. Our data provides strong evidence for the importance of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent anion channel regulation and point to a synchronized adjustment of CPK and anion channel transcript levels to fine-tune anion efflux at the PT tip.
