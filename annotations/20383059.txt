Polar auxin transport is a unique process mediating a wide variety of plant developmental processes. Specific trans-membrane carriers (AUX1/LAX, PGP and PIN protein families) mediate the auxin transport between cells, creating auxin gradients that, in turn, control gene expression. The direction of auxin flow within tissues is mainly determined by the asymmetric subcellular localization of PIN auxin efflux carriers in each transporting cell. For this reason, the mechanisms controlling the subcellular dynamics of auxin transport machinery, in response to developmental and environmental stimuli, are instrumental in the regulation of whole plant development, from embryogenesis to organogenesis, vascular tissue differentiation and tropisms. Here we report the first evidence of differential regulation mechanisms controlling the subcellular dynamics of PIN1 efflux carriers in maize.
