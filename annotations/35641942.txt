Cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare) is widely used in animal feed, beverages, and foods and has become a model crop for molecular evolutionary studies. Few studies have examined the evolutionary fates of different types of genes in barley during the domestication process. The rates of nonsynonymous substitution (Ka) to synonymous substitution (Ks) were calculated by comparing orthologous genes in different barley groups (wild vs. landrace and landrace vs. improved cultivar). The rates of evolution, properties, expression patterns, and diversity of positively selected genes (PSGs) and negatively selected genes (NSGs) were compared. PSGs evolved more rapidly, possessed fewer exons, and had lower GC content than NSGs; they were also shorter and had shorter intron, exon, and first exon lengths. Expression levels were lower, the tissue specificity of expression was higher, and codon usage bias was weaker for PSGs than for NSGs. Nucleotide diversity analysis revealed that PSGs have undergone a more severe genetic bottleneck than NSGs. Several candidate PSGs were involved in plant growth and development, which might make them as excellent targets for the molecular breeding of barley. Our comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary, structural, and functional divergence between PSGs and NSGs in barley provides new insight into the evolutionary trajectory of barley during domestication. Our findings also aid future functional studies of PSGs in barley.
