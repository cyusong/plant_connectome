Flowering reversion is a common phenomenon in plant development in which differentiated floral organs switch from reproductive growth to vegetative growth and ultimately form abnormal floral organs or vegetative organs. This greatly reduces tomato yield and quality. Research on this phenomenon has recently increased, but there is a lack of research at the molecular and gene expression levels. Here, transcriptomic analyses of the inflorescence meristem were performed in two kinds of materials at different developmental stages, and a total of 3223 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened according to the different developmental stages and trajectories of the two materials. The analysis of database annotations showed that these DEGs were closely related to starch and sucrose metabolism, DNA replication and modification, plant hormone synthesis and signal transduction. It was further speculated that tomato flowering reversion may be related to various biological processes, such as cell signal transduction, energy metabolism and protein post-transcriptional regulation. Combined with the results of previous studies, our work showed that the gene expression levels of <i>CLE9</i>, <i>FA</i>, <i>PUCHI</i>, <i>UF</i>, <i>CLV3</i>, <i>LOB30</i>, <i>SFT</i>, <i>S-WOX9</i> and <i>SVP</i> were significantly different in the two materials. Endogenous hormone analysis and exogenous hormone treatment revealed a variety of plant hormones involved in flowering reversion in tomato. Thus, tomato flowering reversion was studied comprehensively by transcriptome analysis for the first time, providing new insights for the study of flower development regulation in tomato and other plants.
