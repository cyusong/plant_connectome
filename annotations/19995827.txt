['19995827', 'FLOWER FLAVONOID TRANSPORTER (FFT) encodes a multidrug and toxin efflux family  transporter in Arabidopsis thaliana. FFT (AtDTX35) is highly transcribed in  floral tissues, the transcript being localized to epidermal guard cells,  including those of the anthers, stigma, siliques and nectaries. Mutant analysis  demonstrates that the absence of FFT transcript affects flavonoid levels in the  plant and that the altered flavonoid metabolism has wide-ranging consequences.  Root growth, seed development and germination, and pollen development, release  and viability are all affected. Spectrometry of mutant versus wild-type flowers  shows altered levels of a glycosylated flavonol whereas anthocyanin seems  unlikely to be the substrate as previously speculated. Thus, as well as adding  FFT to the incompletely described flavonoid transport network, it is found that  correct reproductive development in Arabidopsis is perturbed when this particular  transporter is missing.', '2010', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erp312', 'Glover']
