R2R3-MYB transcription factors play important roles in response to abiotic stresses in planta, such as salt, drought, and osmotic stress. However, the role of FtMYB11 in Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) in drought and osmotic tolerance has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that FtMYB11 was markedly induced by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), salinity, and mannitol. Further, FtMYB11-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed hypersensitivity to ABA-mediated seed germination and seedling establishment through regulating transcripts of AtCBF1, AtDREB2A, and AtRD20, compared with wild type, indicating that FtMYB11 plays a positive role in ABA signaling. In contrast, transgenic lines overexpressing FtMYB11 were sensitive to mannitol and NaCl treatments, suggesting that FtMYB11 plays a negative role in osmotic tolerance. Intriguingly, the transcripts of ABA biosynthetic enzyme genes were significantly elevated in plants overexpressing FtMYB11 after exposure to osmotic stresses, such as AtABA3 and AtNCED3. In addition, flavonoid biosynthesis genes were also upregulated in transgenic Arabidopsis under ABA, salt, and drought treatments, including AtC4H, AtF3H, AtANS, AtFLS, and At4CL. The drought tolerance assay showed that plants overexpressing FtMYB11 displayed greater tolerance to water deficit through regulating MDA and proline content. Taken together, FtMYB11 has opposite roles in response to abiotic stresses, but it may mediate flavonoid biosynthesis through regulation of related enzyme genes.
