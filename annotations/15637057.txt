Peroxisomes in higher plant cells are known to differentiate in function depending on the cell type. Because of the functional differentiation, plant peroxisomes are subdivided into several classes, such as glyoxysomes and leaf peroxisomes. These peroxisomal functions are maintained by import of newly synthesized proteins containing one of two peroxisomal targeting signals known as PTS1 and PTS2. These targeting signals are known to be recognized by the cytosolic receptors, Pex5p and Pex7p, respectively. To demonstrate the contribution of Pex5p and Pex7p to the maintenance of peroxisomal functions in plants, double-stranded RNA constructs were introduced into the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of the PEX5 and PEX7 genes was efficiently reduced by the double-stranded RNA-mediated interference in the transgenic Arabidopsis. The Pex5p-deficient Arabidopsis showed reduced activities for both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions. An identical phenotype was observed in a transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing functionally defective Pex5p. In contrast, the Pex7p-deficient Arabidopsis showed reduced activity for glyoxysomal function but not for leaf peroxisomal function. Analyses of peroxisomal protein import in the transgenic Arabidopsis revealed that Pex5p was involved in import of both PTS1-containing proteins and PTS2-containing proteins, whereas Pex7p contributed to the import of only PTS2-containing proteins. Overall, the results indicated that Pex5p and Pex7p play different roles in the maintenance of glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions in plants.
