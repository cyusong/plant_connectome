In pea, the auxins 4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid (4-Cl-IAA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) occur naturally; however, only 4-Cl-IAA stimulates pericarp growth and gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis, and inhibits the ethylene response in deseeded ovaries (pericarps), mimicking the presence of seeds. Expression of ovary ethylene biosynthesis genes was regulated similarly in most cases by the presence of 4-Cl-IAA or seeds. PsACS1 [which encodes an enzyme that synthesizes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)] transcript abundance was high in pericarp tissue adjacent to developing seeds following pollination. ACC accumulation in 4-Cl-IAA-treated deseeded pericarps was driven by high PsASC1 expression (1800-fold). 4-Cl-IAA, but not IAA, also suppressed the pericarp transcript levels of PsACS4. 4-Cl-IAA increased PsACO1 and decreased PsACO2 and PsACO3 expression (enzymes that convert ACC to ethylene) but did not change ACO enzyme activity. Increased ethylene was countered by a 4-Cl-IAA-specific decrease in ethylene responsiveness potentially via modulation of pericarp ethylene receptor and signaling gene expression. This pattern did not occur in IAA-treated pericarps. Overall, the effect of 4-Cl-IAA and IAA on ethylene biosynthesis gene expression generally explains the ethylene evolution patterns, and their effects on GA biosynthesis and ethylene signaling gene expression explain the tissue response patterns in young pea ovaries.
