Mildew severely reduces soybean yield and quality, and pods are the first line of defence against pathogens. Maize-soybean intercropping (MSI) reduces mildew incidence on soybean pods; however, the mechanism remains unclear. Changing light (CL) from maize shading is the most important environmental feature in MSI. We hypothesized that CL affects isoflavone accumulation in soybean pods, affecting their disease resistance. In the present study, shading treatments were applied to soybean plants during different developmental stages according to various CL environments under MSI. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging (CFI) and classical evaluation methods confirmed that CL, especially vegetative stage shading (VS), enhanced pod resistance to mildew. Further metabolomic analyses and exogenous jasmonic acid (JA) and biosynthesis inhibitor experiments revealed the important relationship between JA and isoflavone biosynthesis, which had a synergistic effect on the enhanced resistance of CL-treated pods to mildew. VS promoted the biosynthesis and accumulation of constitutive isoflavones upstream of the isoflavone pathway, such as aglycones and glycosides, in soybean pods. When mildew infects pods, endogenous JA signalling stimulated the biosynthesis of downstream inducible malonyl isoflavone (MIF) and glyceollin to improve pod resistance.
