The variation of 90 Laminaria gametophyte clones representing the introduced Laminaria japonica (Group 1) and Laminaria longissima (Group 2), the varieties of L. japonica (Group 3) and the varieties derived from interspecific hybrids (Group 4) was determined with 18 microsatellite markers. The allelic diversity and Nei's gene diversity of Group 1 were significantly higher than those of Group 2 (2.9 vs. 1.8 and 0.414 vs. 0.161, respectively), demonstrating that the variation of the introduced L. japonica is richer than that of L. longissima. Both allelic diversity and Nei's gene diversity of Group 3 were lower than those of Group 1, indicating that only a portion of variation of L. japonica was incorporated into the varieties of L. japonica. Significant genetic differentiation was detected between four groups and between female (Population 1) and male (Population 2) gametophyte clones in each group. The variation among groups accounted for 39.95%, while that among populations accounted for 21.65% of the total. The genetic distance between Group 1 and Group 4 was obviously longer than that between Group 2 and Group 4 (0.686 vs. 0.291), indicating that maternal gametophyte clone contributed more variation to the hybrids than the paternal gametophyte clone did.
