In flowering plants, floral induction signals intersect at the shoot apex to modulate meristem determinacy and growth form. Herein, we reported a snRNA-seq analysis of litchi apical buds at different developmental stages. A total of 41,641 nuclei expressing 21,402 genes were analyzed, revealing 35 cell clusters corresponding to 12 broad populations. We signature genes associated with floral transition and propose a model that profile the key events associated with litchi floral meristem identity by analyzing 567 identified floral meristem cells at single cell resolution. Interestingly, snRNA-seq data indicated that all putative FT and TFL1 genes were not expressed in bud nuclei, but significant expressions of them were detected in bud samples using RT-PCR. Based on the expression patterns and gene silencing results, we highlight the critical role of LcTFL1-2 in inhibiting flowering and propose that LcFT1/LcTFL1-2 expression ratio may determine the success flower transition. And the transport of LcFT1 and LcTFL1-2 mRNA from the leaf to the shoot apical meristem was proposed based on in-situ and dot blot hybridization results. These findings allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular events that occur during the litchi floral transition, as well as the identification of new regulators.
