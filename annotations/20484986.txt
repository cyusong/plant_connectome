The priming agent beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) enhances Arabidopsis resistance to microbial pathogens and abiotic stresses through potentiation of the Arabidopsis defense responses. We have previously shown that BABA provokes a stress-induced morphogenic response, reduces vegetative growth and induces accumulation of anthocyanin. It was also found that L-Glutamine restores all tested BABA-induced phenotypes. Here we show that BABA induced transcripts accumulation of the two stress-responsive energy sensor protein kinases KIN10 and KIN11 and L-Glutamine inhibited this effect. It was also postulated that BABA induces a general amino acid stress response. BABA effect on Arabidopsis free amino acids content was thus analyzed. The amino acid balance was found to be altered by BABA treatment. Together these new data further suggest that BABA primes by stress imprinting.

BABA: !induces! transcripts accumulation of KIN10 and KIN11
L-Glutamine: !inhibits! BABA-induced phenotypes
L-Glutamine: !restores! BABA-induced phenotypes
BABA: !alters! amino acid balance
