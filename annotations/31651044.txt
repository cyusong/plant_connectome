Brassica napus (oilseed rape) is an important oil crop in temperate regions, which originated from hybridization of Brassica oleracea and Brassica rapa. Owing to its polyploidy, the functional study of single genes is cumbersome. Phytic acid is considered as an antinutritive compound, and we aimed to knock out the underlying synthesis and transporter genes to identify low phytic acid mutants. We implemented a high-throughput next-generation sequencing screening protocol for an ethylmethane sulfonate population of 7680 plants in six gene families (BnMIPS, BnMIK, Bn2-PGK, BnIPK1, BnIPK2, and BnMRP5) with two paralogues for each gene. A total of 1487 mutations were revealed, and the vast majority (96%) were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Furthermore, the characterization of double mutants of Bn.2-PGK2 showed a significant reduction of phytic acid contents. We propose to use three-dimensional pooling combined with amplicon stacking and next-generation sequencing to identify mutations in polyploid oilseed rape in a fast and cost-effective manner for complex metabolic pathways. Furthermore, the mutants identified in Bn2-PGK2 might be a very valuable resource for industrial production of oilseed rape protein for human consumption.
