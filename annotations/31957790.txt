The activation of calcium signaling is a crucial event for perceiving environmental stress. Colonization by Piriformospora indica, a growth-promoting root endosymbiont, activates cytosolic Ca2+ in Arabidopsis roots. In this study, we examined the role and functional relevance of calcium channels responsible for Ca2+ fluxes. Expression profiling revealed that CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNEL 19 (CNGC19) is an early-activated gene, induced by unidentified components in P. indica cell-wall extract. Functional analysis showed that loss-of-function of CNGC19 resulted in growth inhibition by P.indica, due to increased colonization and loss of controlled fungal growth. The cngc19 mutant showed reduced elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ in response to P. indica cell-wall extract in comparison to the wild-type. Microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity was compromised in the cngc19 lines, as evidenced by unaltered callose deposition, reduced cis-(+)-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, jasmonate, and jasmonoyl isoleucine levels, and down-regulation of jasmonate and other defense-related genes, which contributed to a shift towards a pathogenic response. Loss-of-function of CNGC19 resulted in an inability to modulate indole glucosinolate content during P. indica colonization. CNGC19-mediated basal immunity was dependent on the AtPep receptor, PEPR. CNGC19 was also crucial for P. indica-mediated suppression of AtPep-induced immunity. Our results thus demonstrate that Arabidopsis CNGC19 is an important Ca2+ channel that maintains a robust innate immunity and is crucial for growth-promotion signaling upon colonization by P. indica.
