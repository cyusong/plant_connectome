AGAMOUS-like 15 (AGL15) is a member of the MADS-domain transcription factor (TF) family. MADS proteins are named for a conserved domain that was originally from an acronym derived from genes expressed in a variety of eukaryotes (<b>M</b>CM1-<b>A</b>GAMOUS-<b>D</b>EFICIENS-<b>S</b>ERUM RESPONSE FACTOR). In plants, this family has expanded greatly, with more than one-hundred members generally found in dicots, and the proteins encoded by these genes have often been associated with developmental identity. <i>AGL15</i> transcript and protein accumulate primarily in embryos and has been found to promote an important process called plant regeneration via somatic embryogenesis (SE). To understand how this TF performs this function, we have previously used microarray technologies to assess direct and indirect responsive targets of this TF. We have now revisited this question using next generation sequencing (NGS) to both characterize in vivo binding sites for AGL15 as well as response to the accumulation of AGL15. We compared these data to the prior microarray results to evaluate the different platforms. The new NGS data brought to light an interaction with brassinosteroid (BR) hormone signaling that was "missed" in prior Gene Ontology analysis from the microarray studies.
