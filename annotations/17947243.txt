['17947243', 'Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous calcium-binding protein, regulates diverse  cellular functions by modulating the activity of a variety of proteins. However,  little is known about how CaM directly regulates transcription. Screening of an  Arabidopsis cDNA expression library using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated  calmodulin as a probe identified a calmodulin-binding NAC protein (CBNAC). Using  gel overlay assays, a Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding domain was identified in the C  terminus of this protein. Specific binding of CaM to CaM-binding domain was  corroborated by site-directed mutagenesis and a split-ubiquitin assay. Using a  PCR-mediated random binding site selection method, we identified a DNA-binding  sequence (CBNACBS) for CBNAC, which consisted of a GCTT core sequence flanked on  both sides by other frequently repeating sequences (TTGCTTANNNNNNAAG). CBNAC was  able to bind to CBNACBS, which resulted in the repression of transcription in  Arabidopsis protoplasts. Interestingly, the transcriptional repression mediated  by CBNAC was enhanced by CaM. These results suggest that CBNAC may be a  CaM-regulated transcriptional repressor in Arabidopsis.', '2007 Dec 14', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M705217200', 'Chung']
