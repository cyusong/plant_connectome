Improving phenotypic stability of crops is pivotal for coping with the detrimental impacts of climate change. The goal of this study was to gain first insights into the genetic architecture of phenotypic stability in cereals. To this end, we determined grain yield, thousand kernel weight, test weight, falling number, and both protein and soluble pentosan content for two large bi-parental rye populations connected through one common parent and grown in multi-environmental field trials involving more than 15 000 yield plots. Based on these extensive phenotypic data, we calculated parameters for static and dynamic phenotypic stability of the different traits and applied linkage mapping using whole-genome molecular marker profiles. While we observed an absence of large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying yield stability, large and stable QTLs were found for phenotypic stability of test weight, soluble pentosan content, and falling number. Applying genome-wide selection, which in contrast to marker-assisted selection also takes into account loci with small-effect sizes, considerably increased the accuracy of prediction of phenotypic stability for all traits by exploiting both genetic relatedness and linkage between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and QTLs. We conclude that breeding for crop phenotypic stability can be improved in related populations using genomic selection approaches established upon extensive phenotypic data.
