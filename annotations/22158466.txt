['22158466', 'The regulatory particle (RP) of the 26S proteasome contains a heterohexameric  ring of AAA-ATPases (RPT1-6) that unfolds and inserts substrates into the core  protease (CP) for degradation. Through genetic analysis of the Arabidopsis  thaliana gene pair encoding RPT2, we show that this subunit plays a critical role  in 26S proteasome assembly, histone dynamics, and plant development. rpt2a rpt2b  double null mutants are blocked in both male and female gamete transmission,  demonstrating that the subunit is essential. Whereas rpt2b mutants are  phenotypically normal, rpt2a mutants display a range of defects, including  impaired leaf, root, trichome, and pollen development, delayed flowering, stem  fasciation, hypersensitivity to mitomycin C and amino acid analogs,  hyposensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor MG132, and decreased 26S complex  stability. The rpt2a phenotype can be rescued by both RPT2a and RPT2b, indicative  of functional redundancy, but not by RPT2a mutants altered in ATP  binding/hydrolysis or missing the C-terminal hydrophobic sequence that docks the  RPT ring onto the CP. Many rpt2a phenotypes are shared with mutants lacking the  chromatin assembly factor complex CAF1. Like caf1 mutants, plants missing RPT2a  or reduced in other RP subunits contain less histones, thus implicating RPT2  specifically, and the 26S proteasome generally, in plant nucleosome assembly.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.111.089482', 'Vierstra']
