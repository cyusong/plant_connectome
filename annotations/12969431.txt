['12969431', 'We report the characterization of a plant gene encoding a member of the BET  subgroup of bromodomain proteins, a novel class of putative transcription  factors. Imbibition-inducible 1 (IMB1) appears to be a nuclear protein as  suggested by subcellular localization in onion epidermal cells using an  IMB1-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusion protein. In Arabidopsis thaliana,  IMB1 is expressed at very low levels in dry seeds, but is markedly induced during  seed imbibition. In addition, IMB1 transcript levels are down regulated during  germination. Seeds of a loss-of-function mutant allele, imb1, show impaired  cotyledon greening during germination in abscisic acid (ABA) and express higher  levels of ABI5 protein than the wild type. Moreover, imb1 seeds are deficient in  the phytochrome A (phyA)-mediated very-low-fluence response of germination.  Microarray analysis revealed that genes included in different functional  categories, such as cell-wall metabolism or plastid function, are repressed in  imbibed imb1 seeds. Mutant imb1 plants appear normal, indicating that IMB1 is  involved in regulating a specific developmental stage. Taken together, these  results show that IMB1 plays a role in the promotion of seed germination by both  negatively and positively regulating the ABA and phyA transduction pathways,  respectively. In imbibed seeds, IMB1 modulates the transcription of a battery of  genes, providing clues on its mode of action.', '2003 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01848.x', 'Chua']
