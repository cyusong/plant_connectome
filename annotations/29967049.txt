['29967049', 'The amount of light energy received by the photosynthetic reaction centers  photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) is balanced through state  transitions. Reversible phosphorylation of a light-harvesting antenna trimer  (L-LHCII) orchestrates the association between L-LHCII and the photosystems, thus  adjusting the amount of excitation energy received by the reaction centers. In  this study, we identified the enzyme NUCLEAR SHUTTLE INTERACTING (NSI; AT1G32070)  as an active lysine acetyltransferase in the chloroplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana  Intriguingly, nsi knockout mutant plants were defective in state transitions,  even though they had a similar LHCII phosphorylation pattern as the wild type.  Accordingly, nsi plants were not able to accumulate the PSI-LHCII state  transition complex, even though the LHCII docking site of PSI and the overall  amounts of photosynthetic protein complexes remained unchanged. Instead, the nsi  mutants showed a decreased Lys acetylation status of specific photosynthetic  proteins including PSI, PSII, and LHCII subunits. Our work demonstrates that the  chloroplast acetyltransferase NSI is needed for the dynamic reorganization of  thylakoid protein complexes during photosynthetic state transitions.', '2018 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00155', 'ORCID:']
