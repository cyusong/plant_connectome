Wheat remains a critical global food source, pressured by climate change and the need to maximize yield, improve processing and nutritional quality and ensure safety. An enormous amount of research has been conducted to understand gluten protein composition and structure in relation to end-use quality, yet progress has become stagnant. This is mainly due to the need and inability to biochemically characterize the intact functional glutenin polymer in order to correlate to quality, necessitating reduction to monomeric subunits and a loss of contextual information. While some individual gluten proteins might have a positive or negative influence on gluten quality, it is the sum total of these proteins, their relative and absolute expression, their sub-cellular trafficking, the amount and size of glutenin polymers, and ratios between gluten protein classes that define viscoelasticity of gluten. The sub-cellular trafficking of gluten proteins during seed maturation is still not completely clear and there is evidence of dual pathways and therefore different destinations for proteins, either constitutively or temporally. The trafficking of proteins is also unclear in endosperm cells as they undergo programmed cell death; Golgi disappear around 12 DPA but protein filling continues at least to 25 DPA. Modulation of the timing of cellular events will invariably affect protein deposition and therefore gluten strength and function. Existing and emerging proteomics technologies such as proteoform profiling and top-down proteomics offer new tools to study gluten protein composition as a whole system and identify compositional patterns that can modify gluten structure with improved functionality.
