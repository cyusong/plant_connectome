The purple color of unripe pepper fruit is attributed to the accumulation of anthocyanins. Only a few genes controlling the biosynthesis and regulation of anthocyanins have been cloned in <i>Capsicum</i>. In this study, we performed a bulked segregant analysis of the purple striped trait using an F<sup>2</sup> population derived from a cross between the immature purple striped fruit line Chen12-4-1-1-1-1 and the normal green fruit line Zhongxian101-M-F<sup>9</sup>. We mapped the <i>CaPs</i> locus to an 841.39 kb region between markers M-CA690-Xba and MCA710-03 on chromosome 10. <i>CA10g11690</i> encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor that is involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins as the best candidate gene. Overexpression and silencing in transformed tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) lines indicated that <i>CA10g11690</i> is involved in the formation of purple stripes in the exocarp. A comparison of parental sequences identified an insertion fragment of 1,926 bp in the second intron region of Chen12-4, and eight SNPs were detected between the two parents. Additionally, there were 49 single nucleotide polymorphic variations, two sequence deletions, and four sequence insertions in the promoter region. We found that <i>CA10g11690</i> undergoes alternative splicing and generates different transcripts. Thus, the functional transcript of <i>CA10g11690</i> appeared to be primarily involved in the development of purple phenotype in the exocarp. Our data provide new insight into the mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis and a theoretical basis for the future breeding of purple striped pepper varieties.
