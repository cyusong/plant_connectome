Abiotic stresses restrict the growth and yield of crops. Plants have developed a number of regulatory mechanisms to respond to these stresses. WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are plant-specific transcription factors that play essential roles in multiple plant processes, including abiotic stress response. At present, little information regarding drought-related WRKY genes in maize is available. In this study, we identified a WRKY transcription factor gene from maize, named <i>ZmWRKY40</i>. ZmWRKY40 is a member of WRKY group II, localized in the nucleus of mesophyll protoplasts. Several stress-related transcriptional regulatory elements existed in the promoter region of <i>ZmWRKY40</i>. <i>ZmWRKY40</i> was induced by drought, high salinity, high temperature, and abscisic acid (ABA). <i>ZmWRKY40</i> could rapidly respond to drought with peak levels (more than 10-fold) at 1 h after treatment. Overexpression of <i>ZmWRKY40</i> improved drought tolerance in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> by regulating stress-related genes, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in transgenic lines was reduced by enhancing the activities of peroxide dismutase (POD) and catalase (CAT) under drought stress. According to the results, the present study may provide a candidate gene involved in the drought stress response and a theoretical basis to understand the mechanisms of <i>ZmWRKY40</i> in response to abiotic stresses in maize.
