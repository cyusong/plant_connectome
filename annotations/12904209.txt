['12904209', 'Arabidopsis thaliana MEI1 was first described as a gene involved in male meiosis,  encoding a short protein showing homology with a human acrosin-trypsin inhibitor.  We have isolated a new allele of mei1, and shown that in both mutants male and  female meiosis are affected. In both reproductive pathways, meiosis proceeds  while chromosomes become fragmented, resulting in aberrant meiotic products and  in a strongly reduced fertility. We have shown that the gene mutated in mei1  mutants actually encodes a protein of 972 amino acids that contains five BRCA1  C-terminus (BRCT) domains and is similar to proteins involved in the response to  DNA damage and replication blocks in eukaryotes. During meiosis, recombination is  initiated by the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by the  protein SPO11. We analysed meiotic chromosome behaviour of the mei1 mutant in a  spo11 mutant background and proved that the meiotic fragmentation observed in  mei1 mutants was not the consequence of defects in the repair of meiotic DSBs  induced by SPO11. We also analysed the effect of mei1 on the mitotic cell cycle  but could not detect any sensitivity of mei1 seedlings to DNA-damaging agents  like gamma-rays or UV. Therefore, MEI1 is a BRCT-domain-containing protein that  could be specific to the meiotic cell cycle and that plays a crucial role in some  DNA repair events independent of SPO11 DSB recombination repair.', '2003 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01820.x', 'Pelletier']
