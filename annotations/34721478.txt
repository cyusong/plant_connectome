MicroRNAs are 20-24 nucleotide non-coding RNAs and play important roles in plant-environment interactions. In recent years, many microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to regulate rice immunity against rice blast fungus. However, there are limited studies about miRNAs that directly target resistance (<i>R</i>) genes to regulate rice immunity. In this study, by deep sequencing, small RNA libraries were constructed from four-leaf stage seedlings of the resistant variety Ziyu44 and susceptible variety Jiangnanxiangnuo (JNXN) upon <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> infection, we found that much more miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in Ziyu44 than in JNXN. Among these miRNAs, we focused on miR9664, a newly identified rice miRNA in our sequencing, which was upregulated lightly in Ziyu44 and drastically in JNXN at 24-48 h post-inoculation (hpi). The transgenic plants overexpressing miR9664 (miR9664-oe) displayed reduced defense responses to <i>M. oryzae</i>, while those knocking down miR9664 (miR9664-m) displayed enhanced defense responses to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Most of the detected miR9664 predicted target genes were reduced in the miR9664-oe lines while increased in the miR9664-m lines. The cleavage site of <i>LOC_Os08g07774</i> was confirmed by RLM-RACE. Meanwhile, after being inoculated with <i>M. oryzae</i>, the genes were expressed differently between Ziyu44 and JNXN. The results suggest that miR9664-mediated <i>R</i> gene turnover contributes to Ziyu44 broad-spectrum resistance to rice blast fungus. Taken together, our research identified a new rice miRNA that directly targets <i>R</i> genes to regulate rice immunity against rice blast fungus, adding significant information to the study of rice-<i>M. oryzae</i> interaction.
