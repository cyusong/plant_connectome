A broad diversity of phenotypes are available within the cassava germplasm collections. The phenotypes include improved nutritional, starch or culinary root quality as well as abiotic and biotic resistance properties. Some of these traits can be found naturally occurring in cassava landraces, whereas others are the result of targeted breeding efforts. For future breeding programmes it is important to know the underlying mechanisms of these desirable traits. Metabolomics can assist in the elucidation of these mechanisms by measuring the end products of the cellular processes conferring the traits of interest. The present study focused on the comparison of two or more variants of the same trait such as high and low culinary quality or resistance and susceptibility to thrips. Overall, eight different traits were assessed. Results showed that amino acids and umami compounds were associated with superior culinary attributes and the phenylpropanoid superpathway plays an important role in pest resistance. Furthermore, the data highlighted a low chemodiversity in African cassavas and that the source-sink relation was still active at the harvest stage.
