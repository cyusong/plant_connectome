['15159630', 'Seed dormancy is an important developmental process that prevents pre-harvest  sprouting in many grains and other seeds. Abscisic acid (ABA), a plant hormone,  plays a crucial role in regulating dormancy but the underlying molecular  regulatory mechanisms are not fully understood. An Arabidopsis zinc-finger gene,  MEDIATOR OF ABA-REGULATED DORMANCY 1 ( MARD1 ) was identified and functionally  analyzed. MARD1 expression is up-regulated by ABA. A T-DNA insertion in the  promoter region downstream of two ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) renders MARD1  unable to respond to ABA. The mard1 seeds are less dormant and germinate in total  darkness; their germination is resistant to external ABA at the stage of radicle  protrusion. These results suggest that this novel zinc-finger protein with a  proline-rich N-terminus is an important downstream component of the ABA signaling  pathway that mediates ABA-regulated seed dormancy in Arabidopsis.', '2004 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/B:PLAN.0000028730.10834.e3', 'Gan']
