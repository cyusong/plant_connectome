Plant RSH proteins are able to synthetize and/or hydrolyze unusual nucleotides called (p)ppGpp or alarmones. These molecules regulate nuclear and chloroplast transcription, chloroplast translation and plant development and stress response. Homologs of bacterial RelA/SpoT proteins, designated RSH, and products of their activity, (p)ppGpp-guanosine tetra-and pentaphosphates, have been found in algae and higher plants. (p)ppGpp were first identified in bacteria as the effectors of the stringent response, a mechanism that orchestrates pleiotropic adaptations to nutritional deprivation and various stress conditions. (p)ppGpp accumulation in bacteria decreases transcription-with exception to genes that help to withstand or overcome current stressful situations, which are upregulated-and translation as well as DNA replication and eventually reduces metabolism and growth but promotes adaptive responses. In plants, RSH are nuclei-encoded and function in chloroplasts, where alarmones are produced and decrease transcription, translation, hormone, lipid and metabolites accumulation and affect photosynthetic efficiency and eventually plant growth and development. During senescence, alarmones coordinate nutrient remobilization and relocation from vegetative tissues into seeds. Despite the high conservancy of RSH protein domains among bacteria and plants as well as the bacterial origin of plant chloroplasts, in plants, unlike in bacteria, (p)ppGpp promote chloroplast DNA replication and division. Next, (p)ppGpp may also perform their functions in cytoplasm, where they would promote plant growth inhibition. Furthermore, (p)ppGpp accumulation also affects nuclear gene expression, i.a., decreases the level of Arabidopsis defense gene transcripts, and promotes plants susceptibility towards Turnip mosaic virus. In this review, we summarize recent findings that show the importance of RSH and (p)ppGpp in plant growth and development, and open an area of research aiming to understand the function of plant RSH in response to stress.
