Soil salinity and associated land degradation are major ecological problems. Excess Na<sup>+</sup> ions in soil impede the plant photosynthetic process and Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis status. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can alleviate salt stress in host plants. Although a number of studies have demonstrated that Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation is decreased by mycorrhizae, the molecular mechanisms involved have received little attention from researchers. <i>Populus euphratica</i> is a typical natural woody tree with excellent salt tolerance. Due to its symbiosis forming capability with AMF, we explored the influence of <i>Funneliformis mosseae</i> on the growth, photosynthesis, and expression of three genes involved in Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis within dioecious <i>P. euphratica</i> under salt stress. The results indicated that salt stress significantly increases Na<sup>+</sup> contents and inhibits growth status and photosynthetic capacity, especially in females. However, AMF had positive effects on the growth status, photosynthetic capacity and Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, especially in males. The expression levels of <i>NHX1</i> in shoots and <i>HKT1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> in roots, all of which are involved in Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, were upregulated by <i>F. mosseae</i> under salt stress. For males, the beneficial effect of AMF centered on extruding, sequestering and long-distance transporting of Na<sup>+</sup> ions . For females, the beneficial effect of AMF centered on extruding excessive Na<sup>+</sup>.
