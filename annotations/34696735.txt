Soil salinization is causing ecosystem degradation and crop yield reduction worldwide, and elucidation of the mechanism of salt-tolerant plants to improve crop yield is highly significant. Podocarpus macrophyllus is an ancient gymnosperm species with a unique environmental adaptation strategy that may be attributed to its lengthy evolutionary process. The present study investigated the physiological and molecular responses of P. macrophyllus plants to salt stress by analyzing its photosynthetic system and antioxidant enzyme activity. We also analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in P. macrophyllus under salt stress using RNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly. Salt treatment significantly affected the photosynthetic system in P. macrophyllus seedlings, which decreased chlorophyll content, altered chloroplast ultrastructure, and reduced photosynthesis. The activities of antioxidant enzymes increased significantly following salt stress treatment. Transcriptome analysis showed that salt stress induced a large number of genes involved in multiple metabolic and biological regulation processes. The transcription levels of genes that mediate phytohormone transport or signaling were altered. K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporter-encoding genes and the MYB transcription factor were upregulated under salt stress. However, the genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and secondary metabolism were downregulated. Our research identified some important pathways and putative genes involved in salt tolerance in P. macrophyllus and provided clues for elucidating the mechanism of salt tolerance and the utilization of the salt tolerance genes of P. macrophyllus for crop improvement.
