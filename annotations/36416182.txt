Plant-parasitic cyst nematodes (<i>Heterodera</i> and <i>Globodera</i> spp.) secrete CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-RELATED (CLE) effector proteins, which act as ligand mimics of plant CLE peptides to promote successful nematode infection. Previous studies of the Arabidopsis-beet cyst nematode (BCN; <i>H. schachtii</i>) pathosystem showed that Arabidopsis CLE receptors including CLAVATA1 (CLV1), CLV2, and RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 2 (RPK2) are required for BCN CLE signaling. Studies further revealed that nematode CLE signaling through GmCLV2 and StCLV2, an Arabidopsis CLV2 orthologue from soybean (<i>Glycines max</i>) and potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), respectively, is required for the soybean cyst nematode (SCN; <i>H. glycines</i>) and the potato cyst nematode (PCN; <i>G. rostochiensis</i>) to induce disease in their respective host plant. In this study, we identified and characterized two additional potato receptors, StRPK2 and StCLV1, homologues of Arabidopsis RPK2 and CLV1, for a role in PCN parasitism. Using promoter-reporter lines we showed that both <i>StRPK2</i> and <i>StCLV1</i> are expressed in the potato root but vary in their spatial expression patterns. Interestingly, <i>StRPK2</i> but not <i>StCLV1</i> was found to be expressed and upregulated at PCN infection sites. Nematode infection assays on <i>StRPK2</i>-knockdown lines revealed a decrease in nematode infection. Collectively, our results suggest that parallel CLE signaling pathways involving StCLV2 and StRPK2 are important for PCN parasitism and that manipulation of nematode CLE signaling may represent a viable means to engineer nematode resistance in crop plants including potato.
