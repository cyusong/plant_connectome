Non-expressor of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes1 (NPR1) is a key transcription coactivator of plant basal immunity and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Two mutant alleles, <i>npr1-1</i> and <i>npr1-3</i>, have been extensively used for dissecting the role of NPR1 in various signaling pathways. However, it is unknown whether <i>npr1-1</i> and <i>npr1-3</i> are null mutants. Moreover, the <i>NPR1</i> transcript levels are induced two- to threefold upon pathogen infection or salicylic acid (SA) treatment, but the biological relevance of the induction is unclear. Here, we used molecular and biochemical approaches including quantitative PCR, immunoblot analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to address these questions. We show that <i>npr1-3</i> is a potential null mutant, whereas <i>npr1-1</i> is not. We also demonstrated that a truncated npr1 protein longer than the hypothesized npr1-3 protein is not active in SA signaling. Furthermore, we revealed that TGACG-binding (TGA) factors are required for <i>NPR1</i> induction, but the reverse TGA box in the 5'UTR of <i>NPR1</i> is dispensable for the induction. Finally, we show that full induction of <i>NPR1</i> is required for basal immunity, but not for SAR, whereas sufficient basal transcription is essential for full-scale establishment of SAR. Our results indicate that induced transcript accumulation may be differentially required for different functions of a specific gene. Moreover, as <i>npr1-1</i> is not a null mutant, we recommend that future research should use <i>npr1-3</i> and potential null T-DNA insertion mutants for dissecting NPR1's function in various physiopathological processes.
