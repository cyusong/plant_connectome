In the present study, we selected four distinct classes of light-regulated promoters. The light-regulated promoters can be distinctly grouped into either TATA-box-containing or TATA-less (initiator-containing) promoters. Further, using either native promoters or their swapped versions of core promoter elements, we established that TATA-box and Inr (Initiator) elements have distinct mechanisms which are involved in light-mediated regulation, and these elements are not swappable. We identified that mutations in either functional TATA-box or Inr elements lead to the formation of nucleosomal structure. The nucleotide diversity in either the TATA-box or Inr element in Arabidopsis ecotypes proposes that the nucleotide variation in core promoters can alter the gene expression. We show that motif overrepresentation in light-activated promoters encompasses different specific regulatory motifs present downstream of TSS (transcription start site), and this might serve as a key factor in regulating light promoters which are parallel with these elements. Finally, we conclude that the TATA-box or Inr element does not act in isolation, but our results clearly suggests the probable involvement of other distinct core promoter elements in concurrence with the TATA-box or Inr element to impart selectivity to light-mediated transcription.
