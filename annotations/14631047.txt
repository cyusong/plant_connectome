['14631047', 'The Arabidopsis FWA gene was initially identified from late-flowering epigenetic  mutants that show ectopic FWA expression associated with heritable  hypomethylation of repeats around transcription starting sites. Here, we show  that wild-type FWA displays imprinted (maternal origin-specific) expression in  endosperm. The FWA imprint depends on the maintenance DNA methyltransferase MET1,  as is the case in mammals. Unlike mammals, however, the FWA imprint is not  established by allele-specific de novo methylation. It is established by maternal  gametophyte-specific gene activation, which depends on a DNA glycosylase gene,  DEMETER. Because endosperm does not contribute to the next generation, the  activated FWA gene need not be silenced again. Double fertilization enables  plants to use such "one-way" control of imprinting and DNA methylation in  endosperm.', '2004 Jan 23', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1089835', 'Kakutani']
