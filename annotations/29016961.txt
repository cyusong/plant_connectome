MdMYB1 is an important regulator for anthocyanin accumulation in apple (Malus × domestica). Here, an apple RING E3 ligase, MdMIEL1, was screened out as a partner of MdMYB1 with a yeast two-hybrid approach. Pull-down, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation assays further verified the interaction between MdMIEL1 and MdMYB1 proteins. Subsequently, in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that MdMIEL1 functioned as a ubiquitin E3 ligase to ubiquitinate MdMYB1 protein, followed by degradation through a 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, transgenic studies in apple calli and Arabidopsis demonstrated that MdMIEL1 negatively regulated anthocyanin accumulation by modulating the degradation of MdMYB1 protein. Taken together, our findings provide a new insight into the molecular mechanism by which MdMIEL1 negatively regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis by ubiquitinating and degrading MdMYB1 protein.
