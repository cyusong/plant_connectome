Several yield-related traits selected during crop domestication and improvement<sup>1,2</sup> are associated with increases in meristem size<sup>3</sup>, which is controlled by CLE peptide signals in the CLAVATA-WUSCHEL pathway<sup>4-13</sup>. Here, we engineered quantitative variation for yield-related traits in maize by making weak promoter alleles of CLE genes, and a null allele of a newly identified partially redundant compensating CLE gene, using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. These strategies increased multiple maize grain-yield-related traits, supporting the enormous potential for genomic editing in crop enhancement.
