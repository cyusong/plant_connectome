Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) elicits stomatal closure in many plant species. Stomatal closure is accompanied by large ion fluxes across the plasma membrane (PM). Here, we recorded the transmembrane ion fluxes of H(+) , Ca(2+) and K(+) in guard cells of wild-type (Col-0) Arabidopsis, the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) mutant coi1-1 and the PM H(+) -ATPase mutants aha1-6 and aha1-7, using a non-invasive micro-test technique. We showed that MeJA induced transmembrane H(+) efflux, Ca(2+) influx and K(+) efflux across the PM of Col-0 guard cells. However, this ion transport was abolished in coi1-1 guard cells, suggesting that MeJA-induced transmembrane ion flux requires COI1. Furthermore, the H(+) efflux and Ca(2+) influx in Col-0 guard cells was impaired by vanadate pre-treatment or PM H(+) -ATPase mutation, suggesting that the rapid H(+) efflux mediated by PM H(+) -ATPases could function upstream of the Ca(2+) flux. After the rapid H(+) efflux, the Col-0 guard cells had a longer oscillation period than before MeJA treatment, indicating that the activity of the PM H(+) -ATPase was reduced. Finally, the elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and the depolarized PM drive the efflux of K(+) from the cell, resulting in loss of turgor and closure of the stomata.

Methyl jasmonate (MeJA): !elicits! stomatal closure 
COI1: !requires! MeJA-induced transmembrane ion flux 
PM H(+) -ATPase: !mediates! rapid H(+) efflux 
Ca(2+): !influxes! in response to H(+) efflux 
K(+): !effluxes! due to Ca(2+) influx 
PM H(+) -ATPase: !reduces activity! after MeJA treatment
