The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-Golgi apparatus of plants is the site of synthesis of non-cellulosic polysaccharides that then traffic to the cell wall. A two-step protocol of flotation centrifugation followed by free-flow electrophoresis (FFE) resolved ER and Golgi proteins into three profiles: an ER-rich fraction, two Golgi-rich fractions, and an intermediate fraction enriched in cellulose synthases. Nearly three dozen Rab-like proteins of eight different subgroups were distributed differentially in ER- vs. Golgi-rich fractions, whereas seven 14-3-3 proteins co-fractionated with cellulose synthases in the intermediate fraction. FFE offers a powerful means to classify resident and transient proteins in cell-free assays of cellular location.
