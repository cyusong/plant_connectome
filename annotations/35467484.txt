Over 40% of arable land in the world is acidic. Al stress has become a global agricultural problem affecting plant growth and limiting crop production in acidic soils. Plants have evolved different regulatory mechanisms of adaptation to exogenous environmental challenges, such as Al stress, by altering their growth patterns. In the past decades, several key genes involved in plant response to Al stress and the mechanism of Al detoxification have been revealed. However, the signaling pathways of plant response to Al stress and the regulatory mechanism of plant Al tolerance remain poorly understood. In this review, we summarized the findings of recent studies on the plant Al tolerance mechanism and the molecular regulation mechanism of phytohormones in response to Al stress. This review improves our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of plants in response to Al stress and provides a reference for the breeding of Al-tolerant crops.
