['20153325', 'We have previously demonstrated that RNA interference-mediated suppression of  xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in purine degradation,  causes defects in the normal growth and development of Arabidopsis thaliana.  Here, we investigated a possible role for XDH in drought tolerance, since this  enzyme is also implicated in plant stress responses and acclimatization. When  XDH-suppressed lines were subjected to drought stress, plant growth was markedly  reduced in conjunction with significantly enhanced cell death and H(2)O(2)  accumulation. This drought-hypersensitive phenotype was reversed by pretreatment  with exogenous uric acid, the catalytic product of XDH. These results suggest  that fully functional purine metabolism plays a role in the Arabidopsis drought  acclimatization.', '2010 Mar 19', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2010.02.023', 'Sakamoto']
