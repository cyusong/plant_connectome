DNA methylation is reconfigured during male reproduction in plants, but little is known regarding the mechanisms controlling these epigenetic dynamics. New research highlights how the cell cycle can influence DNA methylation dynamics observed during male gametogenesis and may induce epigenetic variation in clonally propagated plants.
