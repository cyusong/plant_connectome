The soil-borne fungi <i>Fusarium pseudograminearum</i> and <i>Rhizoctonia cerealis</i> are the major pathogens for the economically important diseases <i>Fusarium</i> crown rot (FCR) and sharp eyespot of common wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), respectively. However, there has been no report on the broad resistance of wheat genes against both <i>F. pseudograminearum</i> and <i>R. cerealis</i>. In the current study, we identified <i>TaWAK-6D</i>, a wall-associated kinase (WAK) which is an encoding gene located on chromosome 6D, and demonstrated its broad resistance role in the wheat responses to both <i>F. pseudograminearum</i> and <i>R. cerealis</i> infection. <i>TaWAK-6D</i> transcript induction by <i>F. pseudograminearum</i> and <i>R. cerealis</i> was related to the resistance degree of wheat and the gene expression was significantly induced by exogenous pectin treatment. Silencing of <i>TaWAK-6D</i> compromised wheat resistance to <i>F. pseudograminearum</i> and <i>R. cerealis</i>, and repressed the expression of a serial of wheat defense-related genes. Ectopic expression of <i>TaWAK-6D</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> positively modulated the expression of several defense-related genes. TaWAK-6D protein was determined to localize to the plasma membrane in wheat and <i>N. benthamiana</i>. Collectively, the TaWAK-6D at the plasma membrane mediated the broad resistance responses to both <i>F. pseudograminearum</i> and <i>R. cerealis</i> in wheat at the seedling stage. This study, therefore, concludes that <i>TaWAK-6D</i> is a promising gene for improving wheat broad resistance to FCR and sharp eyespot.
