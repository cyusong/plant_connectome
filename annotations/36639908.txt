With ongoing global climate change, water scarcity-induced drought stress remains a major threat to agricultural productivity. Plants undergo a series of physiological and morphological changes to cope with drought stress, including stomatal closure to reduce transpiration and changes in root architecture to optimize water uptake. Combined phenotypic and multi-omics studies have recently identified a number of drought-related genetic resources in different crop species. The functional dissection of these genes using molecular techniques has enriched our understanding of drought responses in crops and has provided genetic targets for enhancing resistance to drought. Here, we review recent advances in the cloning and functional analysis of drought resistance genes and the development of technologies to mitigate the threat of drought to crop production.
