['15342965', 'In all eucaryotic cells, specific vesicle fusion during vesicular transport is  mediated by membrane-associated proteins called SNAREs (soluble N-ethyl-maleimide  sensitive factor attachment protein receptors). Sequence analysis identified a  total of 54 SNARE genes (18 Qa-SNAREs/Syntaxins, 11 Qb-SNAREs, 8 Qc-SNAREs, 14  R-SNAREs/VAMPs and 3 SNAP-25) in the Arabidopsis genome. Almost all of them were  ubiquitously expressed through out all tissues examined. A series of transient  expression assays using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused proteins revealed  that most of the SNARE proteins were located on specific intracellular  compartments: 6 in the endoplasmic reticulum, 9 in the Golgi apparatus, 4 in the  trans-Golgi network (TGN), 2 in endosomes, 17 on the plasma membrane, 7 in both  the prevacuolar compartment (PVC) and vacuoles, 2 in TGN/PVC/vacuoles, and 1 in  TGN/PVC/plasma membrane. Some SNARE proteins showed multiple localization  patterns in two or more different organelles, suggesting that these SNAREs  shuttle between the organelles. Furthermore, the SYP41/SYP61-residing  compartment, which was defined as the TGN, was not always located along with the  Golgi apparatus, suggesting that this compartment is an independent organelle  distinct from the Golgi apparatus. We propose possible combinations of SNARE  proteins on all subcellular compartments, and suggest the complexity of the  post-Golgi membrane traffic in higher plant cells.', '2004 Apr', 'Cell Struct Funct', '10.1247/csf.29.49', 'Sato']
