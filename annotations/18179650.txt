We have investigated the establishment of histone H3 methylation with respect to environmental and developmental signals for two key genes associated with C4 photosynthesis in maize. Tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) in roots and leaves was shown to be controlled by autonomous cell-type-specific developmental signals that are independent of illumination and therefore independent of the initiation of transcription. Di- and mono-methylation of H3K4 act antagonistically to this process. The modifications were already established in etiolated seedlings, and remained stable when genes were inactivated by dark treatment or pharmaceutical inhibition of transcription. Constitutive di-methylation of H3K9 was concomitantly detected at specific gene positions. The data support a histone code model whereby cell-type-specific signals induce the formation of a chromatin structure that potentiates gene activation by environmental cues.

H3K4: !methylated by! developmental signals 
H3K4: !repressed by! di- and mono-methylation 
H3K9: !constitutively methylated at! specific gene positions 
environmental cues: !potentiate gene activation by! chromatin structure
