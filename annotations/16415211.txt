['16415211', 'Up-regulation of the high-affinity transport system (HATS) for NO(3)(-) and  stimulation of lateral root (LR) growth are two important adaptive responses of  the root system to nitrogen limitation. Up-regulation of the NO(3)(-) HATS by  nitrogen starvation is suppressed in the atnrt2.1-1 mutant of Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana), deleted for both NRT2.1 and NRT2.2 nitrate transporter  genes. We then used this mutant to determine whether lack of HATS stimulation  affected the response of the root system architecture (RSA) to low NO(3)(-)  availability. In Wassilewskija (Ws) wild-type plants, transfer from high to low  NO(3)(-) medium resulted in contrasting responses of RSA, depending on the level  of nitrogen limitation. Moderate nitrogen limitation (transfer from 10 mm to 1 or  0.5 mm NO(3)(-)) mostly led to an increase in the number of visible laterals,  while severe nitrogen stress (transfer from 10 mm to 0.1 or 0.05 mm NO(3)(-))  promoted mean LR length. The RSA response of the atnrt2.1-1 mutant to low  NO(3)(-) was markedly different. After transfer from 10 to 0.5 mm NO(3)(-), the  stimulated appearance of LRs was abolished in atnrt2.1-1 plants, whereas the  increase in mean LR length was much more pronounced than in Ws. These  modifications of RSA mimicked those of Ws plants subjected to severe nitrogen  stress and could be fully explained by the lowered NO(3)(-) uptake measured in  the mutant. This suggests that the uptake rate of NO(3)(-), rather than its  external concentration, is the key factor triggering the observed changes in RSA.  However, the mutation of NRT2.1 was also found to inhibit initiation of LR  primordia in plants subjected to nitrogen limitation independently of the rate of  NO(3)(-) uptake by the whole root system and even of the presence of added  NO(3)(-) in the external medium. This indicates a direct stimulatory role for  NRT2.1 in this particular step of LR development. Thus, it is concluded that  NRT2.1 has a key dual function in coordinating root development with external  NO(3)(-) availability, both indirectly through its role as a major NO(3)(-)  uptake system that determines the nitrogen uptake-dependent RSA responses, and  directly through a specific action on LR initiation under nitrogen-limited  conditions.', '2006 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.075721', 'Gojon']
