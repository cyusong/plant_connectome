H<sub>2</sub> gas, usually in the form of H<sub>2</sub>-saturated water, could play a useful role in improving many aspects of plant growth and productivity, including resistance to stress tolerance and improved post-harvest durability. Therefore, molecular hydrogen delivery systems should be considered as a valuable addition within agricultural practice. Agriculture and food security are both impacted by plant stresses, whether that is directly from human impact or through climate change. A continuously increasing human population and rising food consumption means that there is need to search for agriculturally useful and environment friendly strategies to ensure future food security. Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) research has gained momentum in plant and agricultural science owing to its multifaceted and diverse roles in plants. H<sub>2</sub> application can mitigate against a range of stresses, including salinity, heavy metals and drought. Therefore, knowing how endogenous, or exogenously applied, H<sub>2</sub> enhances the growth and tolerance against numerous plant stresses will enhance our understanding of how H<sub>2</sub> may be useful for future to agriculture and horticulture. In this review, recent progress and future implication of H<sub>2</sub> in agriculture is highlighted, focusing on how H<sub>2</sub> impacts on plant cell function and how it can be applied for better plant performance. Although the exact molecular action of H<sub>2</sub> in plants remains elusive, this safe and easy to apply treatment should have a future in agricultural practice.
