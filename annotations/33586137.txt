Timely flowering is essential for optimum crop reproduction and yield. To determine the best flowering-time genes (FTGs) relevant to local adaptation and breeding, it is essential to compare the interspecific genetic architecture of flowering in response to light and temperature, the two most important environmental cues in crop breeding. However, the conservation and variations of FTGs across species lack systematic dissection. This review summarizes current knowledge on the genetic architectures underlying light and temperature-mediated flowering initiation in Arabidopsis, rice, and temperate cereals. Extensive comparative analyses show that most FTGs are conserved, whereas functional variations in FTGs may be species specific and confer local adaptation in different species. To explore evolutionary dynamics underpinning the conservation and variations in FTGs, domestication and selection of some key FTGs are further dissected. Based on our analyses of genetic control of flowering time, a number of key issues are highlighted. Strategies for modulation of flowering behavior in crop breeding are also discussed. The resultant resources provide a wealth of reference information to uncover molecular mechanisms of flowering in plants and achieve genetic improvement in crops.
