Isoflavones are major secondary metabolites that are exclusively produced by legumes, including soybean. Soy isoflavones play important roles in human health as well as in the plant defense system. The isoflavone content is influenced by minor-effect quantitative trait loci, which interact with polygenetic and environmental factors. It has been difficult to clarify the regulation of isoflavone biosynthesis because of its complex heritability and the influence of external factors. Here, using a genotype-by-sequencing-based genome-wide association mapping study, 189 mutant soybean genotypes (the mutant diversity pool, MDP) were genotyped on the basis of 25,646 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequency of >0.01 except for missing data. All the accessions were phenotyped by determining the contents of 12 isoflavones in the soybean seeds in two consecutive years (2020 and 2021). Then, quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) related to isoflavone contents were identified and validated using multi-locus GWAS models. A total of 112 and 46 QTNs related to isoflavone contents were detected by multiple MLM-based models in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Of these, 12 and 5 QTNs were related to more than two types of isoflavones in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Forty-four QTNs were detected within the 441-Kb physical interval surrounding Gm05:38940662. Of them, four QTNs (Gm05:38936166, Gm05:38936167, Gm05:38940662, and Gm05:38940717) were located at Glyma.05g206900 and Glyma.05g207000, which encode glutathione S-transferase THETA 1 (<i>GmGSTT1</i>), as determined from previous quantitative trait loci annotations and the literature. We detected substantial differences in the transcript levels of <i>GmGSTT1</i> and two other core genes (<i>IFS1</i> and <i>IFS2</i>) in the isoflavone biosynthetic pathway between the original cultivar and its mutant. The results of this study provide new information about the factors affecting isoflavone contents in soybean seeds and will be useful for breeding soybean lines with high and stable concentrations of isoflavones.
