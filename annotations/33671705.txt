Persistent lesion mimic can cause leaf senescence, affecting grain yield in crops. However, knowledge about the regulation of lesion mimic and leaf senescence in crop plants is still limited. Here, we report that the amino acid transporter OsAAP3, a negative regulator of tiller bud elongation and rice grain yield, is involved in lesion mimic and leaf senescence. Altered expression of <i>OsAAP3</i> can initiate the nitric oxide signaling pathway through excessive accumulation of arginine in rice leaves, influencing ROS accumulation, antioxidant enzymes activities, proline concentration, and malondialdehyde concentration. This finally triggers cell death which ultimately leads to lesion mimic and leaf senescence by regulating the degradation of chloroplast and the expression abundance of components in the photosynthetic pathway. Overall, the results not only provide initial insights into the regulatory role of amino acid transport genes in rice growth and development, but also help to understand the factors regulating the leaf senescence.
