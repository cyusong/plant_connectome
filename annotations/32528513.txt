The rapid development of remote sensing in agronomic research allows the dynamic nature of longitudinal traits to be adequately described, which may enhance the genetic improvement of crop efficiency. For traits such as light interception, biomass accumulation, and responses to stressors, the data generated by the various high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) methods requires adequate statistical techniques to evaluate phenotypic records throughout time. As a consequence, information about plant functioning and activation of genes, as well as the interaction of gene networks at different stages of plant development and in response to environmental stimulus can be exploited. In this review, we outline the current analytical approaches in quantitative genetics that are applied to longitudinal traits in crops throughout development, describe the advantages and pitfalls of each approach, and indicate future research directions and opportunities.
