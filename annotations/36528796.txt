['36528796', 'Proline is an amino acid that is degraded in the mitochondria by the sequential  action of proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) and pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase  (P5CDH) to form glutamate. We investigated the phenotypes of Arabidopsis  wild-type plants, the knockout prodh1 prodh2 double-mutant, and knockout p5cdh  allelic mutants grown at low and high nitrate supplies. Surprisingly, only p5cdh  presented lower seed yield and produced lighter seeds. Analyses of elements in  above-ground organs revealed lower C concentrations in the p5cdh seeds.  Determination of C, N, and dry matter partitioning among the above-ground organs  revealed a major defect in stem-to-seed resource allocations in this mutant.  Again surprisingly, defects in C, N, and biomass allocation to seeds dramatically  increased in high-N conditions. 15N-labelling consistently confirmed the defect  in N remobilization from the rosette and stem to seeds in p5cdh. Consequently,  the p5cdh mutants produced morphologically abnormal, C-depleted seeds that  displayed very low germination rates. The most striking result was the strong  amplification of the N-remobilization defects in p5cdh under high nitrate supply,  and interestingly this phenotype was not observed in the prodh1 prodh2  double-mutant irrespective of nitrate supply. This study reveals an essential  role of P5CDH in carbon and nitrogen remobilization for reserve accumulation  during seed development in Arabidopsis.', '2023 Mar 13', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erac499', 'ORCID:']
