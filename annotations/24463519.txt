['24463519', 'RNA-directed DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana depends on the upstream  synthesis of 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by RNA POLYMERASE IV  (Pol IV) and downstream synthesis of non-coding transcripts by Pol V. Pol V  transcripts are thought to interact with siRNAs which then recruit DOMAINS  REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) to methylate DNA. The SU(VAR)3-9 homologues  SUVH2 and SUVH9 act in this downstream step but the mechanism of their action is  unknown. Here we show that genome-wide Pol V association with chromatin  redundantly requires SUVH2 and SUVH9. Although SUVH2 and SUVH9 resemble histone  methyltransferases, a crystal structure reveals that SUVH9 lacks a  peptide-substrate binding cleft and lacks a properly formed S-adenosyl methionine  (SAM)-binding pocket necessary for normal catalysis, consistent with a lack of  methyltransferase activity for these proteins. SUVH2 and SUVH9 both contain SRA  (SET- and RING-ASSOCIATED) domains capable of binding methylated DNA, suggesting  that they function to recruit Pol V through DNA methylation. Consistent with this  model, mutation of DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) causes loss of DNA methylation,  a nearly complete loss of Pol V at its normal locations, and redistribution of  Pol V to sites that become hypermethylated. Furthermore, tethering SUVH9  [corrected] with a zinc finger to an unmethylated site is sufficient to recruit  Pol V and establish DNA methylation and gene silencing. These results indicate  that Pol V is recruited to DNA methylation through the methyl-DNA binding SUVH2  and SUVH9 proteins, and our mechanistic findings suggest a means for selectively  targeting regions of plant genomes for epigenetic silencing.', '2014 Mar 6', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature12931', 'Jacobsen']
