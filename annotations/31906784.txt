By timing many diel rhythmic events, circadian clock provides an adaptive advantage for higher plants. Meanwhile, circadian clock displays plasticity and can be entrained by the external environmental cues and internal factors. However, whether cellular energy status can regulate circadian clock is largely unknown in higher plants. The evolutionarily conserved TOR (target of rapamycin) signaling among eukaryotic organisms has been implicated as an integrator for cellular nutrient and energy status. Here, we demonstrated that chemically blocking electron transport chain of mitochondrial can lengthen the circadian period. Similarly, chemical inhibition of TOR activity by Torin 1, a specific inhibitor for TOR kinase, and knockdown of <i>TOR</i> transcript levels significantly elongate the circadian period as well. Our findings imply that TOR signaling may mediate energy status-regulated circadian clock in plants, and the reciprocal regulation between the circadian clock and TOR signaling might be an evolutionary mechanism for fitness and adaptation in plants.
