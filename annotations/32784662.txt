Plants need to cope with multitudes of stimuli throughout their lifecycles in their complex environments. Calcium acts as a ubiquitous secondary messenger in response to numerous stresses and developmental processes in plants. The major Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs), interact with CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) to form a CBL-CIPK signaling network, which functions as a key component in the regulation of multiple stimuli or signals in plants. In this review, we describe the conserved structure of CBLs and CIPKs, characterize the features of classification and localization, draw conclusions about the currently known mechanisms, with a focus on novel findings in response to multiple stresses, and summarize the physiological functions of the CBL-CIPK network. Moreover, based on the gradually clarified mechanisms of the CBL-CIPK complex, we discuss the present limitations and potential prospects for future research. These aspects may provide a deeper understanding and functional characterization of the CBL-CIPK pathway and other signaling pathways under different stresses, which could promote crop yield improvement via biotechnological intervention.
