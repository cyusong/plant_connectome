Wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) has a lower panicle seed setting rate (PSSR) and gamete fertility than domesticated rice (Oryza sativa), but the genetic mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we cloned a null allele of OsMLH1, an ortholog of MutL-homolog 1 to yeast and mammals, from wild rice O. rufipogon W1943 and revealed a 5.4-kb retrotransposon insertion in OsMLH1 is responsible for the low PSSR in wild rice. In contrast to the wild-type, a near isogenic line NIL-mlh1 exhibits defective crossover (CO) formation during meiosis, resulting in reduced pollen viability, partial embryo lethality, and low PSSR. Except for the mutant of mismatch repair gene postmeiotic segregation 1 (Ospms1), all other MutL mutants from O. sativa indica subspecies displayed male and female semi-sterility similar to NIL-mlh1, but less severe than those from O. sativa japonica subspecies. MLH1 and MLH3 did not contribute in an additive fashion to fertility. Two types of MutL heterodimers, MLH1-PMS1 and MLH1-MLH3, were identified in rice, but only the latter functions in promoting meiotic CO formation. Compared to japonica varieties, indica cultivars had greater numbers of CO events per meiosis. Our results suggest that low fertility in wild rice may be caused by different gene defects, and indica and japonica subspecies have substantially different CO rates responsible for the discrepancy between the fertility of mlh1 and mlh3 mutants.
