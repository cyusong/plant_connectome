During soil drought (i.e. limited soil water availability to plants), woody species may adjust the structure of their vessel network to improve their resistance against future soil drought stress. Impacts of soil drought on intervessel lateral contact remain poorly understood despite of its significance to xylem transport efficiency and safety. Here, we analysed drought-induced modifications in xylem structures of temperate angiosperm trees with a focus on intervessel lateral contact. Anatomical analyses were performed both in stems of seedlings cultivated under different substrate water availability and annual rings of mature individuals developed during years of low and high soil drought intensities. In response to limited water availability, a decrease in vessel diameter (up to -20%) and simultaneous increase in vessel density (up to +60%) were observed both in seedlings and mature trees. Conversely, there were only small and inconsistent drought-induced changes in intervessel contact frequency and intervessel contact fraction (typically up to ±15%) observed across species, indicating that intervessel lateral contact is a conservative trait. The small adjustments in intervessel lateral contacts were primarily driven by changes in the contact frequencies between neighbouring vessels (i.e. vessel grouping) rather than by changes in proportions of shared cell walls. Our results demonstrate that angiosperm tree species, despite remarkable adjustments in vessel dimensions and densities upon soil drought, exhibit surprisingly invariant intervessel lateral contact architecture.
