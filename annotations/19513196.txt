The arbuscular mycorrhhiza (AM) symbiosis involves an intricate network of signaling and biochemical pathways designed to ensure that a beneficial relationship is established between the plant and fungal partners as a result of a mutual nutrient exchange. Emerging data has been recently published to explain why the relationship is not always fair, as observed in prevalent parasitic AM relationships in which the plant host receives no phosphorus (P) in exchange for carbon (C) delivered to the fungus. The theory behind this unorthodox view of the AM relationship, together with the description of other recent developments in nutrient mobilization as well as in key aspects of the bi-directional signaling that culminates in the symbiotic association, is the subject of this review.
