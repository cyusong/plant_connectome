['19895401', 'Plants fend off potentially damaging ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation by synthesizing  and accumulating UV-B-absorbing flavonols that function as sunscreens. Regulation  of this biosynthetic pathway is largely transcriptional and controlled by a  network of transcription factors, among which the PRODUCTION OF FLAVONOL  GLYCOSIDES (PFG) family of R2R3-MYB transcription factors was recently identified  with a pivotal function. Here, we describe the response of Arabidopsis seedlings  to narrow-band UV-B radiation at the level of phenylpropanoid pathway genes using  whole-genome transcriptional profiling and identify the corresponding flavonol  glycosides accumulating under UV-B. We further show that the bZIP transcriptional  regulator ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) is required for the transcriptional  activation of the PFG1/MYB12 and PFG3/MYB111 genes under UV-B and visible light.  A synthetic protein composed of HY5 with the VP16 activation domain is sufficient  to activate PFG1/MYB12 expression in planta. However, even though myb11 myb12  myb111 triple mutants have strongly reduced CHS levels in darkness as well as in  constant light, neither light- nor UV-B-inducibility seems impaired.  Notwithstanding this, absence of the three PFG family transcription factors  results in reduced UV-B tolerance, whereas PFG1/MYB12 overexpression leads to an  increased tolerance. Thus, our data suggest that HY5-dependent regulation of PFG  gene expression contributes to the establishment of UV-B tolerance.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.02061.x', 'Ulm']
