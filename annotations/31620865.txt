The MIR160 family in Gossypium hirsutum and G. barbadense was characterized, and miR160a_A05 was found to increase cotton-fiber length by downregulating its target gene (ARF17) and several GH3 genes. Cotton fiber is the most important raw material for the textile industry. MicroRNAs are involved in regulating cotton-fiber development, but a role in fiber elongation has not been demonstrated. In this study, miR160a was found to be differentially expressed in elongating fibers between two interspecific (between Gossypium hirsutum and G. barbadense) backcross inbred lines (BILs) with different fiber lengths. The gene MIR160 colocalized with a previously mapped fiber-length quantitative trait locus. Its target gene ARF17 was differentially expressed between the two BILs during fiber elongation, but in the inverse fashion. Bioinformatics was used to analyze the MIR160 family in both G. hirsutum and G. barbadense. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis identified MIR160a as the functional MIR160 gene encoding the miR160a precursor during fiber elongation. Using virus-induced gene silencing and overexpression, overexpressed MIR160a_A05 resulted in significantly longer fibers compared with wild type, whereas suppression of miR160 resulted in significantly shorter fibers. Expression levels of the target gene auxin-response factor 17 (ARF17) and related genes GH3 in the two BILs and/or the virus-infected plants demonstrated similar changes in response to modulation of miR160a level. Finally, overexpression or suppression of miR160 increased or decreased, respectively, the cellular level of indole-3-acetic acid, which is involved in fiber elongation. These results describe a specific regulatory mechanism for fiber elongation in cotton that can be utilized for future crop improvement.
