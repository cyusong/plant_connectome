SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), which is conserved across various plant species, plays essential and various roles in flower and fruit development. However, the regulatory network of the role of SEP3 in flowering time at the molecular level remained unclear. Here, we investigated that SEP3 in Ziziphus jujuba Mill. (ZjSEP3) was expressed in four floral organs and exhibited strong transcriptional activation activity. ZjSEP3 transgenic Arabidopsis showed an early-flowering phenotype and altered the expression of some genes related to flowering. Among them, the expression of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (AtLHY), the key gene of circadian rhythms, was significantly suppressed. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) further verified that ZjSEP3 inhibited the transcription of AtLHY by binding to the CArG-boxes in its promoter. Moreover, ZjSEP3 also could bind to the ZjLHY promoter and the conserved binding regions of ZjSEP3 were found in the LHY promoter of various plant species. The ectopic regulatory pathway of ZjSEP3-AtLHY was further supported by the ability of 35S::AtLHY to rescue the early-flowering phenotype in ZjSEP3 transgenic plants. In ZjSEP3 transgenic plants, total chlorophyll content and the expression of genes involved in chlorophyll synthesis increased during vegetative stages, which should contribute to its early flowering and relate to the regulatory of AtLHY. Overall, ZjSEP3-AtLHY pathway represents a novel regulatory mechanism that is involved in the regulation of flowering time.
