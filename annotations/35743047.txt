Protein phosphorylation is the most frequent post-translational modification (PTM) that plays important regulatory roles in a wide range of biological processes. Phosphorylation mainly occurs on serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), and tyrosine (Tyr) residues, with the phosphorylated Tyr sites accounting for ~1-2% of all phosphorylated residues. Tyr phosphorylation was initially believed to be less common in plants compared to animals; however, recent investigation indicates otherwise. Although they lack typical protein Tyr kinases, plants possess many dual-specificity protein kinases that were implicated in diverse cellular processes by phosphorylating Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues. Analyses of sequenced plant genomes also identified protein Tyr phosphatases and dual-specificity protein phosphatases. Recent studies have revealed important regulatory roles of Tyr phosphorylation in many different aspects of plant growth and development and plant interactions with the environment. This short review summarizes studies that implicated the Tyr phosphorylation in biosynthesis and signaling of plant hormones.
