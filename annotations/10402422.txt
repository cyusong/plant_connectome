['10402422', 'Mutagenized Arabidopsis seedlings (ecotype Columbia) were screened for the  ability to grow photoautotrophically on solid medium containing 200 mM NaCl. A  novel mutant line, designated pst1 (for photoautotrophic salt tolerance1), was  obtained. There were no significant differences between pst1 and wild-type plants  with regard to their ability to induce proline as an osmoregulatory solute. In  addition, the content of monovalent cations in pst1 plants grown with or without  salt stress was equal to that in the wild type. We observed that light, even at  moderate intensities, increased the effects of salt stress on wild-type plants.  The pst1 seedlings were nearly 10 times more tolerant to methyl viologen than  were wild-type seedlings. We also found that the activities of the active oxygen  scavengers superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase were enhanced  significantly in pst1 plants. The pst1 plants also were tolerant to other  stresses, such as high light intensity and toxic monovalent cations. The  recessive nature of the pst1 mutation indicates that the potential for  salt-stress tolerance is blocked in wild-type Arabidopsis.', '1999 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.11.7.1195', 'Kobayashi']
