Micro RNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as an important class of gene expression regulators controlling development, growth and metabolism. These short RNA molecules are 20-24 nucleotides in length and act post-transcriptionally to regulate the cleavage or translation of specific mRNA targets. In the model legume Medicago truncatula, we have recently reported identification of 100 novel and 27 conserved miRNAs in root apexes and nodules. Statistical analysis on sequencing results revealed specific miRNA isoforms for the same family (up to 3 mismatches) showing contrasting expression patterns between these tissues. Here, we report the cleavage of a non-conserved target of miR156 in root apexes complementary to a differentially expressed miR156 isoform. This suggests that changes in the abundance of miRNA isoforms may have functional consequences on the post-transcriptional regulation of new mRNA targets in different organs.

miRNA: !regulates! mRNA targets
miRNA: !controls! development, growth and metabolism
miRNA: !has specific isoforms! for same family
miRNA: !cleaves! non-conserved target
miRNA: !differentially expressed! in different organs
