The enormous biological diversity of endophytes, coupled with their potential to enhance the production of bioactive metabolites in plants, has driven research efforts focusing on endophytes. However, limited information is available on the impacts of bacterial endophytes on plant secondary metabolism and signaling pathways involved. This work showed that an endophytic Acinetobacter sp. ALEB16, capable of activating accumulation of plant volatile oils, also induced abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) production in Atractylodes lancea. Pre-treatment of plantlets with biosynthetic inhibitors of ABA or SA blocked the bacterium-induced volatile production. ABA inhibitors suppressed not only the bacterium-induced volatile accumulation but also the induced ABA and SA generation; nevertheless, SA inhibitors did not significantly inhibit the induced ABA biosynthesis, implying that SA acted downstream of ABA production. These results were confirmed by observations that exogenous ABA and SA reversed the inhibition of bacterium-induced volatile accumulation by inhibitors. Transcriptional activities of genes in sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis also increased significantly with bacterium, ABA and SA treatments. Mevalonate pathway proved to be the main source of isopentenyldiphosphate for bacterium-induced sesquiterpenoids, as assessed in experiments using specific terpene biosynthesis inhibitors. These results suggest that Acinetobacter sp. acts as an endophytic elicitor to stimulate volatile biosynthesis of A. lancea via an ABA/SA-dependent pathway, thereby yielding additional insight into the interconnection between ABA and SA in biosynthesis-related signaling pathways.
