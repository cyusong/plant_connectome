Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is the causal agent of bacterial leaf blight, a serious disease of rice. We demonstrated earlier that the type II secretion system (T2S) is important for virulence of X. oryzae pv. oryzae and that several proteins, including a xylanase, are secreted through this system. In this study, the xynB gene encoding for the secreted xylanase was cloned as a 6.9-kb EcoRI fragment (pRR7) that also included a paralog called xynA. As in X. oryzae pv. oryzae, xynA and xynB are adjacent to each other in X. axonopodis pv. citri, whereas only the xynA homolog is present in X. campestris pv. campestris. Mutations in xynB but not xynA affect secreted xylanase activity. Western blot analysis using anti-XynB antibodies on exudates from infected rice leaves indicated that this xylanase is expressed during in planta growth. Another T2S-secreted protein was identified to be a lipase/esterase (LipA) based on the sequence tags obtained by tandem mass spectrometry analysis and biochemical assays. Mutations in either xynB or lipA partially affected virulence. However, a lipA-xynB double mutant was significantly reduced for virulence, and the pRR7 clone containing an intact xynB gene could complement the virulence-deficient phenotype of the lipA-xynB mutant. Our results suggest that there is functional redundancy among the T2S secreted proteins of X. oryzae pv. oryzae in promoting virulence on rice.
