['11573014', 'The Arabidopsis LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) gene is a central embryonic regulator  that serves critical roles both early and late during embryo development. LEC2 is  required for the maintenance of suspensor morphology, specification of cotyledon  identity, progression through the maturation phase, and suppression of premature  germination. We cloned the LEC2 gene on the basis of its chromosomal position and  showed that the predicted polypeptide contains a B3 domain, a DNA-binding motif  unique to plants that is characteristic of several transcription factors. We  showed that LEC2 RNA accumulates primarily during seed development, consistent  with our finding that LEC2 shares greatest similarity with the B3 domain  transcription factors that act primarily in developing seeds, VIVIPAROUS1/ABA  INSENSITIVE3 and FUSCA3. Ectopic, postembryonic expression of LEC2 in transgenic  plants induces the formation of somatic embryos and other organ-like structures  and often confers embryonic characteristics to seedlings. Together, these results  suggest that LEC2 is a transcriptional regulator that establishes a cellular  environment sufficient to initiate embryo development.', '2001 Sep 25', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.201413498', 'Harada']
