Auxin concentration gradients, established by polar transport of auxin, are essential for the establishment and maintenance of polar growth and morphological patterning. Three families of cellular transport proteins, PIN-formed (PIN), P-glycoprotein (ABCB/PGP), and AUXIN RESISTANT 1/LIKE AUX1 (AUX1/LAX), can independently and co-ordinately transport auxin in plants. Regulation of these proteins involves intricate and co-ordinated cellular processes, including protein-protein interactions, vesicular trafficking, protein phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and stabilization of the transporter complexes on the plasma membrane.
