Chlorella microalgae are increasingly used for various purposes such as fatty acid production, wastewater processing, or as health-promoting food supplements. A mass spectrometry-based survey of N-glycan structures of strain collection specimens and 80 commercial Chlorella products revealed a hitherto unseen intragenus diversity of N-glycan structures. Differing numbers of methyl groups, pentoses, deoxyhexoses, and N-acetylglucosamine culminated in c. 100 different glycan masses. Thirteen clearly discernible glycan-type groups were identified. Unexpected features included the occurrence of arabinose, of different and rare types of monosaccharide methylation (e.g. 4-O-methyl-N-acetylglucosamine), and substitution of the second N-acetylglucosamine. Analysis of barcode ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequences established a phylogenetic tree that essentially went hand in hand with the grouping obtained by glycan patterns. This brief prelude to microalgal N-glycans revealed a fabulous wealth of undescribed structural features that finely differentiated Chlorella-like microalgae, which are notoriously poor in morphological attributes. In light of the almost identical N-glycan structural features that exist within vertebrates or land plants, the herein discovered diversity is astonishing and argues for a selection pressure only explicable by a fundamental functional role of these glycans.
