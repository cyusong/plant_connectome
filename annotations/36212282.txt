BEige and Chediak-Higashi domain containing proteins (BDCPs) have been described to function in membrane-dependent processes in eukaryotes. This role was also observed for the BDCP SPIRRIG (SPI) in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> in the context of cell morphogenesis. Additionally, <i>AtSPI</i> was found to control salt stress resistance by mediating mRNA stability and salt stress-dependent processing body formation. In this work, we utilize an evolutionarily comparative approach to unravel conserved, basal BDCP functions in the liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>. Our phenotypic and physiological analyses show that Mp<i>SPI</i> is involved in cell morphogenesis and salt resistance regulation, indicating that both functions are evolutionarily conserved between the two species. Co-localization was found with endosomal and P-body markers, suggesting links to membrane-dependent processes and mRNA metabolism. Finally, we present transcriptomics data showing that <i>AtSPI</i> and Mp<i>SPI</i> regulate orthologous genes in <i>A. thaliana</i> and <i>M. polymorpha</i>.
