Chromatin modifications shape the epigenome and are essential for gene expression reprogramming during plant development and adaptation to the changing environment. Chromatin modification enzymes require primary metabolic intermediates such as S-adenosyl-methionine, acetyl-CoA, alpha-ketoglutarate, and NAD<sup>+</sup> as substrates or cofactors. The availability of the metabolites depends on cellular nutrients, energy and reduction/oxidation (redox) states, and affects the activity of chromatin regulators and the epigenomic landscape. The changes in the plant epigenome and the activity of epigenetic regulators in turn control cellular metabolism through transcriptional and post-translational regulation of metabolic enzymes. The interplay between metabolism and the epigenome constitutes a basis for metabolic control of plant growth and response to environmental changes. This review summarizes recent advances regarding the metabolic control of plant chromatin regulators and epigenomes, which are involved in plant adaption to environmental stresses.
