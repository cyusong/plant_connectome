['18817773', 'Plants use sugars as signaling molecules and possess mechanisms to detect and  respond to changes in sugar availability, ranging from the level of secondary  signaling molecules to altered gene transcription. G-protein-coupled pathways are  involved in sugar signaling in plants. The Arabidopsis thaliana regulator of  G-protein signaling protein 1 (AtRGS1) combines a receptor-like seven  transmembrane domain with an RGS domain, interacts with the Arabidopsis Galpha  subunit (AtGPA1) in a d-glucose-regulated manner, and stimulates AtGPA1 GTPase  activity. We determined that AtRGS1 interacts with additional components,  genetically defined here, to serve as a plasma membrane sensor for d-glucose.  This interaction between AtRGS1 and AtGPA1 involves, in part, the  seven-transmembrane domain of AtRGS1.', '2008 Oct 29', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2008.08.038', 'Jones']
