Plant cell membranes are the sites of sensing and initiation of rapid responses to changing environmental factors including salinity stress. Understanding the mechanisms involved in membrane remodeling is important for studying salt tolerance in plants. This task remains challenging in complex tissue due to suboptimal subcellular membrane isolation techniques. Here, we capitalized on the use of a surface charge-based separation method, free flow electrophoresis, to isolate the tonoplast (TP) and plasma membrane (PM) from leaf tissue of the halophyte ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L.). Results demonstrated a membrane-specific lipidomic remodeling in this plant under salt conditions, including an increased proportion of bilayer forming lipid phosphatidylcholine in the TP and an increase in nonbilayer forming and negatively charged lipids (phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine) in the PM. Quantitative proteomics showed salt-induced changes in proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis and desaturation, glycerolipid, and sterol synthesis, as well as proteins involved in lipid signaling, binding, and trafficking. These results reveal an essential plant mechanism for membrane homeostasis wherein lipidome remodeling in response to salt stress contributes to maintaining the physiological function of individual subcellular compartments.
