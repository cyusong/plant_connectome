The interaction of plants with complex microbial communities is the result of co-evolution over millions of years and contributed to plant transition and adaptation to land. The ability of plants to be an essential part of complex and highly dynamic ecosystems is dependent on their interaction with diverse microbial communities. Plant microbiota can support, and even enable, the diverse functions of plants and are crucial in sustaining plant fitness under often rapidly changing environments. The composition and diversity of microbiota differs between plant and soil compartments. It indicates that microbial communities in these compartments are not static but are adjusted by the environment as well as inter-microbial and plant-microbe communication. Hormones take a crucial role in contributing to the assembly of plant microbiomes, and plants and microbes often employ the same hormones with completely different intentions. Here, the function of hormones as go-betweens between plants and microbes to influence the shape of plant microbial communities is discussed. The versatility of plant and microbe-derived hormones essentially contributes to the creation of habitats that are the origin of diversity and, thus, multifunctionality of plants, their microbiota and ultimately ecosystems.
