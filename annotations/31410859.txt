Plants are acutely sensitive of their light environment, adapting their growth habit and prioritizing developmental decisions to maximize fecundity. In addition to providing an energy source and directional information, light quality also contributes to entrainment of the circadian system, an endogenous timing mechanism that integrates endogenous and environmental signalling cues to promote growth. Whereas plants' perception of red and blue portions of the spectrum are well defined, green light sensitivity remains enigmatic. In this study, we show that low fluence rates of green light are sufficient to entrain and maintain circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis and that cryptochromes contribute to this response. Importantly, green light responses are distinguishable from low blue light-induced phenotypes. These data suggest a distinct signalling mechanism enables entrainment of the circadian system in green light-enriched environments, such as those found in undergrowth and in densely planted monoculture.
