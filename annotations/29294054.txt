A universal plant response to phosphorus deprivation is the up-regulation of a diverse array of phosphatases. As reported recently, the AtPECP1 gene encodes a phosphatase with in vitro substrate specificity for phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine. The putative substrates suggested that AtPECP1 is related to phospholipid metabolism; however, the biological function of AtPECP1 is as yet not understood. In addition, whereas lipid remodelling processes as part of the phosphorus starvation response have been extensively studied, knowledge of the polar head group metabolism and its regulation is lacking. We found that AtPECP1 is expressed in the cytosol and exerts by far its strongest activity in roots of phosphate-starved plants. We established a novel LC-MS/MS-based method for the quantitative and simultaneous measurement of the head group metabolites. The analysis of Atpecp1 null mutants and overexpression lines revealed that phosphoethanolamine, but not phosphocholine is the substrate of AtPECP1 in vivo. The impact on head group metabolite levels is greatest in roots of both loss-of-function and gain-of-function transgenic lines, indicating that the biological role of AtPECP1 is mainly restricted to roots. We suggest that phosphoethanolamine hydrolysis by AtPECP1 during Pi starvation is required to down-regulate the energy-consuming biosynthesis of phosphocholine through the methylation pathway.
