Rosaceae, a large plant family of more than 3,000 species, consists of many economically important fruit and ornamental crops, including peach, apple, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, and rose. These horticultural crops are not only important economic drivers in many regions of the world, but also major sources of human nutrition. Additionally, due to the diversity of fruit types in Rosaceae, this plant family offers excellent opportunities for investigations into fleshy fruit diversity, evolution, and development. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies and computational tools, an increasing number of high-quality genomes and transcriptomes of Rosaceae species have become available and will greatly facilitate Rosaceae research and breeding. This review summarizes major genomic resources and genome research progress in Rosaceae, highlights important databases, and suggests areas for further improvement. The availability of these big data resources will greatly accelerate research progress and enhance the agricultural productivity of Rosaceae.
