['18408158', 'Protein N-glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in the Golgi  apparatus is an essential process in eukaryotic cells. Although the  N-glycosylation pathway in the ER has been shown to regulate protein quality  control, salt tolerance, and cellulose biosynthesis in plants, no biological  roles have been linked functionally to N-glycan modifications that occur in the  Golgi apparatus. Herein, we provide evidence that mutants defective in N-glycan  maturation, such as complex glycan 1 (cgl1), are more salt-sensitive than wild  type. Salt stress caused growth inhibition, aberrant root-tip morphology, and  callose accumulation in cgl1, which were also observed in an ER  oligosaccharyltransferase mutant, staurosporin and temperature sensitive 3a  (stt3a). Unlike stt3a, cgl1 did not cause constitutive activation of the unfolded  protein response. Instead, aberrant modification of the plasma membrane  glycoprotein KORRIGAN 1/RADIALLY SWOLLEN 2 (KOR1/RSW2) that is necessary for  cellulose biosynthesis occurred in cgl1 and stt3a. Genetic analyses identified  specific interactions among rsw2, stt3a, and cgl1 mutations, indicating that the  function of KOR1/RSW2 protein depends on complex N-glycans. Furthermore,  cellulose deficient rsw1-1 and rsw2-1 plants were also salt-sensitive. These  results establish that plant protein N-glycosylation functions beyond protein  folding in the ER and is necessary for sufficient cell-wall formation under salt  stress.', '2008 Apr 15', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0800237105', 'Koiwa']
