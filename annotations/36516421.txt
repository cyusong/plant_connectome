['36516421', 'ROOT MERISTEM GROWTH FACTOR1 (RGF1) and its receptors RGF1 INSENSITIVEs (RGIs)  regulate primary root meristem activity via a mitogen-activated protein kinase  (MPK) signaling cascade in Arabidopsis. However, it is unknown how RGF1 regulates  lateral root (LR) development. Here, we show that the RGF1-RGI1 peptide-receptor  pair negatively regulates LR development via activation of PUCHI encoding  AP2/EREBP. Exogenous RGF1 peptides inhibited LR development of the wild type.  However, the rgi1 mutants were partially or fully insensitive to RGF1 during LR  development, whereas four other rgi single mutants, namely rgi2, rgi3, rgi4, and  rgi5, were sensitive to RGF1 in inhibiting LR formation. Consistent with this,  the red fluorescent protein (RFP) signals driven by the RGF1 promoter were  detected at stage I and the following stages, overlapping with RGI1 expression.  PUCHI expression was significantly up-regulated by RGF1 but completely inhibited  in rgi1. LR development of puchi1-1 was insensitive to RGF1. PUCHI expression  driven by the RGI1 promoter reduced LR density in both the wild type and  rgi1,2,3. Further, mpk6, but not mpk3, displayed significantly down-regulated  PUCHI expression and insensitive LR development in response to RGF1.  Collectively, these results suggest that the RGF1-RGI1 module negatively  regulates LR development by activating PUCHI expression via MPK6.', '2023 Mar 13', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erac495', 'ORCID:']
