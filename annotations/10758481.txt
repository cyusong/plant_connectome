['10758481', "Chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis and degradation are the only biochemical processes  on Earth that can be directly observed from satellites or other planets. The bulk  of the Chls is found in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosynthetic  organisms. Surprisingly little is known about the biosynthesis of Chl b, which is  the second most abundant Chl pigment after Chl a. We describe here the expression  and properties of the chlorophyllide a oxygenase gene (CAO) from Arabidopsis  thaliana, which is apparently the key enzyme in Chl b biosynthesis. The  recombinant enzyme produced in Escherichia coli catalyses an unusual two-step  oxygenase reaction that is the 'missing link' in the chlorophyll cycle of higher  plants.", '2000 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00672.x', 'Rudiger']
