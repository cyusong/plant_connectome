['10617574', 'In all multicellular organisms growth and morphogenesis must be coordinated, but  for higher plants, this is of particular importance because the timing of  organogenesis is not fixed but occurs in response to environmental constraints.  One particularly dramatic developmental juncture is the response of  dicotyledonous seedlings to light. The det3 mutant of Arabidopsis develops  morphologically as a light-grown plant even when it is grown in the dark. In  addition, it shows organ-specific defects in cell elongation and has a reduced  response to brassinosteroids (BRs). We have isolated the DET3 gene by positional  cloning and provide functional and biochemical evidence that it encodes subunit C  of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase). We show that the hypocotyl elongation  defect in the det3 mutant is conditional and provide evidence that this is due to  an alternative mechanism of V-ATPase assembly. Together with the expression  pattern of the DET3 gene revealed by GFP fluorescence, our data provide in vivo  evidence for a role for the V-ATPase in the control of cell elongation and in the  regulation of meristem activity.', '1999 Dec 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.13.24.3259', 'Chory']
