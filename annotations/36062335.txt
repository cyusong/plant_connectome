Iron deficiency is a major constraint for plant growth in calcareous soils. The interplay between NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> and Fe nutrition affects plant performance under Fe-deficient conditions. However, how NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> negatively regulates Fe nutrition at the molecular level in plants remains elusive. Here, we showed that the key nitrate transporter NRT1.1 in Arabidopsis plants, especially in the shoots, was markedly downregulated at post-translational levels by Fe deficiency. However, loss of NRT1.1 function alleviated Fe deficiency chlorosis, suggesting that downregulation of NRT1.1 by Fe deficiency favors plant tolerance to Fe deficiency. Further analysis showed that although disruption of NRT1.1 did not alter Fe levels in both the shoots and roots, it improved the reutilization of apoplastic Fe in shoots but not in roots. In addition, disruption of NRT1.1 prevented Fe deficiency-induced apoplastic alkalization in shoots by inhibiting apoplastic H<sup>+</sup> depletion via NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> uptake. In vitro analysis showed that reduced pH facilitates release of cell wall-bound Fe. Thus, foliar spray with an acidic buffer promoted the reutilization of Fe in the leaf apoplast to enhance plant tolerance to Fe deficiency, while the opposite was true for the foliar spray with a neutral buffer. Thus, downregulation of the shoot-part function of NRT1.1 prevents apoplastic alkalization to ensure the reutilization of apoplastic Fe under Fe-deficient conditions. Our findings may provide a basis for elucidating the link between N and Fe nutrition in plants and insight to scrutinize the relevance of shoot-expressed NRT1.1 to the plant response to stress.
