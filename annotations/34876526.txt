Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) is an essential element for growth and development in both animals and plants, while high levels of environmental sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) represent a threat to most plants. The uptake of K<sup>+</sup> from high-saline environments is an essential mechanism to maintain intracellular K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, which can help reduce toxicity caused by Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation, thereby improving the salt tolerance of plants. However, the mechanisms and regulation of K<sup>+</sup>-uptake during salt stress remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified an endoplasmic reticulum-localized cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>5</sub> (OsCYB5-2) that interacted with a high-affinity K<sup>+</sup> transporter (OsHAK21) at the plasma membrane. The association of OsCYB5-2 with the OsHAK21 transporter caused an increase in transporter activity by enhancing the apparent affinity for K<sup>+</sup>-binding but not Na<sup>+</sup>-binding. Heme binding to OsCYB5-2 was essential for the regulation of OsHAK21. High salinity directly triggered the OsHAK21-OsCYB5-2 interaction, promoting OsHAK21-mediated K<sup>+</sup>-uptake and restricting Na<sup>+</sup> entry into cells; this maintained intracellular K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in rice cells. Finally, overexpression of <i>OsCYB5-2</i> increased OsHAK21-mediated K<sup>+</sup> transport and improved salt tolerance in rice seedlings. This study revealed a posttranslational regulatory mechanism for HAK transporter activity mediated by a cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>5</sub> and highlighted the coordinated action of two proteins to perceive Na<sup>+</sup> in response to salt stress.
