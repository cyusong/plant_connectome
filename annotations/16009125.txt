Defining the life span of specific human cell populations is limited by our inability to mark the exact time when cells are born in a way that can be detected over many years. In this issue of Cell, Spalding et al. (2005) describe a clever strategy for retrospectively birth dating human cells in vivo, based on their incorporation of 14C during a peak in atmospheric levels of this isotope resulting from above-ground nuclear arms testing in the 1950s.

Gene: !affects! Life span 
Gene: !incorporates! 14C 
Atmosphere: !contains! 14C 
Nuclear arms testing: !increases! 14C
