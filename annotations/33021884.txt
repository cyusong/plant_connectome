Leaf spot on tea plants (<i>Camellia sinensis</i> [L.] Kuntze), caused by the fungus <i>Didymella segeticola</i> (Q. Chen) Q. Chen, Crous & L. Cai (syn. <i>Phoma segeticola</i>), negatively affects the productivity and quality of tea leaves in Guizhou Province, China. Although the genome sequence of <i>D. segeticola</i> has been published, no data on the transcriptome or microRNAs (miRNAs) of the pathogen or host during infection are available. Here, we report on the high-quality transcriptome and miRNA sequences of both <i>D. segeticola</i> and tea during infection, using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 or HiSeq 2500 platforms. Comprehensive expression profiling of the fungal pathogen and its host will provide a resource for future research into trait-specific genes of the pathogen and the host as well as on host-pathogen interactions and on disease resistance mechanisms.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
