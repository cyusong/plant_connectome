Metabolons are temporary structural-functional complexes of sequential enzymes of a metabolic pathway that are distinct from stable multi-enzyme complexes. Here we provide a brief history of the study of enzyme-enzyme assemblies with a particular focus on those that mediate substrate channeling in plants. Large numbers of protein complexes have been proposed for both primary and secondary metabolic pathways in plants. However, to date only four substrate channels have been demonstrated. We provide an overview of current knowledge concerning these four metabolons and explain the methodologies that are currently being applied to unravel their functions. Although the assembly of metabolons has been documented to arise through diverse mechanisms, the physical interaction within the characterized plant metabolons all appear to be driven by interaction with structural elements of the cell. We therefore pose the question as to what methodologies could be brought to bear to enhance our knowledge of plant metabolons that assemble via different mechanisms? In addressing this question, we review recent findings in non-plant systems concerning liquid droplet phase separation and enzyme chemotaxis and propose strategies via which such metabolons could be identified in plants. We additionally discuss the possibilities that could be opened up by novel approaches based on: (i) subcellular-level mass spectral imaging, (ii) proteomics, and (iii) emergent methods in structural and computational biology.
