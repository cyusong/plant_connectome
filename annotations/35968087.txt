Submergence during germination impedes aerobic metabolisms and limits the growth of most higher plants. However, some wetland plants including rice can germinate under submerged conditions. It has long been hypothesized that the first elongating shoot tissue, the coleoptile, acts as a snorkel to acquire atmospheric oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to initiate the first leaf elongation and seminal root emergence. Here, we obtained direct evidence for this hypothesis by visualizing the spatiotemporal O<sub>2</sub> dynamics during submerged germination in rice using a planar O<sub>2</sub> optode system. In parallel with the O<sub>2</sub> imaging, we tracked the anatomical development of shoot and root tissues in real-time using an automated flatbed scanner. Three hours after the coleoptile tip reached the water surface, O<sub>2</sub> levels around the embryo transiently increased. At this time, the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an enzyme critical for anaerobic metabolism, was significantly reduced, and the coleorhiza covering the seminal roots in the embryo was broken. Approximately 10 h after the transient burst in O<sub>2</sub>, seminal roots emerged. A transient O<sub>2</sub> burst around the embryo was shown to be essential for seminal root emergence during submerged rice germination. The parallel application of a planar O<sub>2</sub> optode system and automated scanning system can be a powerful tool for examining how environmental conditions affect germination in rice and other plants.
