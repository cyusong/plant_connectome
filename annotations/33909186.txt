['33909186', "RNA PROCESSING FACTORs 1 AND 8 (RPF1 and RPF8), both restorer of fertility like  pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, are required for processing of dicistronic  nad4L-atp4 and nad3-rps12 transcripts in Arabidopsis mitochondria. In  mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), the 5' termini of many RNAs  are generated on the post-transcriptional level. This process is still poorly  understood in terms of both the underlying mechanism as well as proteins  required. Our studies now link the generation of polymorphic 5' extremities of  the dicistronic nad3-rps12 and nad4L-atp4 transcripts to the function of the  P-type pentatricopeptide repeat proteins RNA PROCESSING FACTORs 8 (RPF8) and 1  (RPF1). RPF8 is required to generate the nad3-rps12 -141 5' end in ecotype Van-0  whereas the RPF8 allele in Col has no function in the generation of any 5'  terminus of this transcript. This observation strongly suggests the involvement  of an additional factor in the generation of the -229 5' end of nad3-rps12  transcripts in Col. RPF1, previously found to be necessary for the generation of  the -228 5' end of the major 1538 nucleotide-long nad4 mRNAs, is also important  for the formation of nad4L-atp4 transcripts with a 5' end at position -318 in  Col. Many Arabidopsis ecotypes contain inactive RPF1 alleles resulting in the  accumulation of various low abundant nad4L-atp4 RNAs which might represent  precursor and/or degradation products. Some of these ecotypes accumulate major,  but slightly smaller RNA species. The introduction of RPF1 into these lines not  only establishes the formation of the major nad4L-atp4 dicistronic mRNA with the  -318 5' terminus, the presence of this gene also suppresses the accumulation of  most alternative nad4L-atp4 RNAs. Beside RPF1, several other factors contribute  to nad4L-atp4 transcript formation.", '2021 Jul', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-021-01153-9', 'ORCID:']
