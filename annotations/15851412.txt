Thioredoxin affinity chromatography can be used to recognize the target proteins of thioredoxin or thioredoxin-related proteins in whole cells or certain cellular compartments. In the last couple of years, many potential target proteins have been identified from various organelles and organisms by this method. Based on the information on the target proteins provided by these studies, the complete thioredoxin-related redox networks can now be efficiently described.
