['16564517', 'Pollen tube elongation in the pistil is a crucial step in the sexual reproduction  of plants. Because the wall of the pollen tube tip is composed of a single layer  of pectin and, unlike most other plant cell walls, does not contain cellulose or  callose, pectin methylesterases (PMEs) likely play a central role in the pollen  tube growth and determination of pollen tube morphology. Thus, the functional  studies of pollen-specific PMEs, which are still in their infancy, are important  for understanding the pollen development. We identified a new Arabidopsis  pollen-specific PME, AtPPME1, characterized its native expression pattern, and  used reverse genetics to demonstrate its involvement in determination of the  shape of the pollen tube and the rate of its elongation.', '2006 Jun 1', 'Dev Biol', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.02.026', 'Citovsky']
