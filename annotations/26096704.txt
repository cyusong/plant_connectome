The CLAVATA3 (CLV3)/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (ESR)-RELATED (CLE) gene family encodes small secreted peptide ligands in plants. These peptides function non-cell autonomously through interactions with plasma membrane-associated LEUCINE-RICH REPEAT RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASEs (LRR-RLKs). These interactions are critical for cell-to-cell communications and control a variety of developmental and physiological processes in plants, such as regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation in the meristems, embryo and endosperm development, vascular development and autoregulation of nodulation. Here, we review the current knowledge in the field of CLE polypeptide signaling.
