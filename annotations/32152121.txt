Auxin is a class of plant hormone that plays a crucial role in the life cycle of plants, particularly in the growth response of plants to ever-changing environments. Since the auxin responses are concentration-dependent and higher auxin concentrations might often be inhibitory, the optimal endogenous auxin level must be closely controlled. However, the underlying mechanism governing auxin homeostasis remains largely unknown. In this study, a UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT76F1) was identified from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, which participates in the regulation of auxin homeostasis by glucosylation of indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA), a major precursor of the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis, in the formation of IPyA glucose conjugates (IPyA-Glc). In addition, UGT76F1 was found to mediate hypocotyl growth by modulating active auxin levels in a light- and temperature-dependent manner. Moreover, the transcription of <i>UGT76F1</i> was demonstrated to be directly and negatively regulated by PIF4, which is a key integrator of both light and temperature signaling pathways. This study sheds a light on the trade-off between IAA biosynthesis and IPyA-Glc formation in controlling auxin levels and reveals a regulatory mechanism for plant growth adaptation to environmental changes through glucosylation of IPyA.
