The evolution of chloroplasts from the original endosymbiont involved the transfer of thousands of genes from the ancestral bacterial genome to the host nucleus, thereby combining the two genetic systems to facilitate coordination of gene expression and achieve integration of host and organelle functions. A key element of successful endosymbiosis was the evolution of a unique protein import system to selectively and efficiently target nuclear-encoded proteins to their site of function within the chloroplast after synthesis in the cytoplasm. The chloroplast TOC-TIC (translocon at the outer chloroplast envelope-translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope) general protein import system is conserved across the plant kingdom, and is a system of hybrid origin, with core membrane transport components adapted from bacterial protein targeting systems, and additional components adapted from host genes to confer the specificity and directionality of import. In vascular plants, the TOC-TIC system has diversified to mediate the import of specific, functionally related classes of plastid proteins. This functional diversification occurred as the plastid family expanded to fulfill cell- and tissue-specific functions in terrestrial plants. In addition, there is growing evidence that direct regulation of TOC-TIC activities plays an essential role in the dynamic remodeling of the organelle proteome that is required to coordinate plastid biogenesis with developmental and physiological events.
