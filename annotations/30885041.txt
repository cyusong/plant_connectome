Thiol-disulfide redox exchanges are widely distributed modifications of great importance for metabolic regulation in living cells. In general, the formation of disulfide bonds is controlled by thioredoxins (TRXs), ubiquitous proteins with two redox-active cysteine residues separated by a pair of amino acids. While the function of plastidial TRXs has been extensively studied, the role of the mitochondrial TRX system is much less well understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that the mitochondrial TRXs are required for the proper functioning of the major metabolic pathways, including stomatal function and antioxidant metabolism under sub-optimal conditions including drought and salinity. Furthermore, inactivation of mitochondrial TRX system leads to metabolite adjustments of both primary and secondary metabolism following drought episodes in arabidopsis, and makes the plants more resistant to salt stress. Here we discuss the implications of these findings, which clearly open up several research avenues to achieve a full understanding of the redox control of metabolism under environmental constraining conditions.
