Autophagy is essential for nutrient recycling and plays a fundamental role in seed production and grain filling in plants. Autophagy participates in nitrogen remobilization at the whole-plant level, and the seeds of autophagy mutants present abnormal C and N contents relative to wild-type (WT) plants. It is well known that autophagy (ATG) genes are induced in leaves during senescence; however, expression of such genes in seeds has not yet been reported. In this study we show that most of the ATG genes are induced during seed maturation in Arabidopsis siliques. Promoter-ATG8f::UIDA and promoter-ATG8f::GFP fusions showed the strong expression of ATG8f in the phloem companion cells of pericarps and the funiculus, and in the embryo. Expression was especially strong at the late stages of development. The presence of many GFP-ATG8 pre-autophagosomal structures and autophagosomes confirmed the presence of autophagic activity in WT seed embryos. Seeds of atg5 and WT plants grown under low- or high-nitrate conditions were analysed. Nitrate-independent phenotypes were found with higher seed abortion in atg5 and early browing, higher total protein concentrations in the viable seeds of this mutant as compared to the WT. The higher total protein accumulation in atg5 viable seeds was significant from early developmental stages onwards. In addition, relatively low and early accumulation of 12S globulins were found in atg5 seeds. These features led us to the conclusion that atg5 seed development is accelerated and that the protein storage deposition pathway is somehow abnormal or incomplete.
