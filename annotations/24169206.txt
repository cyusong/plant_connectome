Studying the implication of hydrogen peroxide in biological processes in plants remains a challenge due to the current shortcomings of H2O2-responsive probes. The use of ContPY1, a new fluorescent probe, which is highly selective and sensitive for H2O2, was investigated. To validate the use of ContPY1 on plants, we have generated protocols employing cells suspensions and leaves, and measured specifically H2O2 production by plants using spectrofluorometry and microscopy.
