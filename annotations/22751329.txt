Regulation of cell elongation is important for plant morphogenesis. Many studies have shown that cortical microtubules play crucial roles during cell elongation and that microtubule stability, organization, and dynamics are regulated by microtubule regulatory proteins. Recently, we reported that a novel protein from Arabidopsis, termed microtubule-destabilizing protein 25 (MDP25), functions as a negative regulator of hypocotyl cell elongation. MDP25 destabilizes microtubules and exerts its effect on microtubules as a result of transient elevation of cytosolic calcium levels.

MDP25: !destabilizes! microtubules
MDP25: !elevates! cytosolic calcium levels
microtubule regulatory proteins: !regulate! microtubule stability, organization, and dynamics
cortical microtubules: !play crucial roles! during cell elongation
