['9371881', 'AtUBC2 of Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a structural homolog of the RAD6 gene of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae with approximately 65% identical amino acids. Like  structural homologs from other organisms, AtUBC2 lacks the carboxyl-terminal  extension of mostly acidic amino acids which is present in Rad6p. AtUBC2 was  expressed in S. cerevisiae rad6 mutants. It was found to partially complement the  UV sensitivity and reduced growth rate of rad6 mutants at elevated temperatures.  AtUBC2 however, has no apparent influence on the degradation of N-end rule  substrates in the heterologous host.', '1997 Nov', 'Curr Genet', '10.1007/s002940050282', 'Bachmair']
