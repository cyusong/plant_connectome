The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is involved in cyclic electron transport around photosystem I (PSI) and chlororespiration. Although the NDH complex was discovered more than 20 years ago, its low abundance and fragile nature render it recalcitrant to analysis, and it is thought that some of its subunits remain to be identified. Here, we identified the NDH subunit NdhV that readily disassociates from the NDH complex in the presence of detergent, salt and alkaline solutions. The Arabidopsis ndhv mutant is partially defective in the accumulation of NDH subcomplex A (SubA) and SubE, resulting in impaired NDH activity. NdhV was mainly detected in the wild-type thylakoid membrane, and its accumulation in thylakoids strictly depended on the presence of the NDH complex. Quantitative immunoblot analysis revealed that NdhV and NdhN occur at close to equimolar concentrations. Furthermore, several NDH subunits were co-immunopurified with NdhV using a combination of chemical crosslinking and an affinity chromatography assay. These data indicate that NdhV is an intrinsic subunit of NDH. We found that NdhV did not directly affect NDH activity, but that NDH SubA and SubE were more rapidly degraded in ndhv than in the wild type under high-light treatment. We propose that NdhV is an NDH subunit that stabilizes this complex, especially under high-light conditions.
