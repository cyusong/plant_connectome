During drought, abscisic acid (ABA) induces closure of stomata via a signaling pathway that involves the calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup> )-independent protein kinase OST1, as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent protein kinases. However, the interconnection between OST1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in ABA-induced stomatal closure has not been fully resolved. ABA-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were monitored in intact Arabidopsis leaves, which express the ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter R-GECO1-mTurquoise and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent activation of S-type anion channels was recorded with intracellular double-barreled microelectrodes. ABA triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that occurred during the initiation period, as well as in the acceleration phase of stomatal closure. However, a subset of stomata closed in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. On average, stomata closed faster if Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were elicited during the ABA response. Loss of OST1 prevented ABA-induced stomatal closure and repressed Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, whereas elevation of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration caused a rapid activation of SLAC1 and SLAH3 anion channels. Our data show that the majority of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are evoked during the acceleration phase of stomatal closure, which is initiated by OST1. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are likely to activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent protein kinases, which enhance the activity of S-type anion channels and boost stomatal closure.
