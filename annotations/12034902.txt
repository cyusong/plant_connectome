['12034902', 'The AKT2 K(+) channel is endowed with unique functional properties, being the  only weak inward rectifier characterized to date in Arabidopsis. The gene is  expressed widely, mainly in the phloem but also at lower levels in leaf epiderm,  mesophyll, and guard cells. The AKT2 mRNA level is upregulated by abscisic acid.  By screening a two-hybrid cDNA library, we isolated a protein phosphatase 2C  (AtPP2CA) involved in abscisic acid signaling as a putative partner of AKT2. We  further confirmed the interaction by in vitro binding studies. The expression of  AtPP2CA (beta-glucuronidase reporter gene) displayed a pattern largely  overlapping that of AKT2 and was upregulated by abscisic acid. Coexpression of  AtPP2CA with AKT2 in COS cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes was found to induce  both an inhibition of the AKT2 current and an increase of the channel inward  rectification. Site-directed mutagenesis and pharmacological analysis revealed  that this functional interaction involves AtPP2CA phosphatase activity.  Regulation of AKT2 activity by AtPP2CA in planta could allow the control of K(+)  transport and membrane polarization during stress situations.', '2002 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.000943', 'Thibaud']
