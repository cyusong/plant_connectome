<i>Pseudomonas coronafaciens</i> X-1 was isolated from halo blight lesions on oat leaves in Korea. Currently, no genome resource on the oat halo blight pathogen is available. Here, the complete genome sequence of this strain, containing a circular chromosome and one circular megaplasmid is reported. This is the first genome sequence of the oat halo blight pathogen and will contribute to our understanding of the pathogenicity and ecological aspects of the halo blight pathogen and the interactions between <i>P. coronafaciens</i> and oats.
