Calcium plays an essential role in pollen tube tip growth. However, little is known concerning the molecular basis of the signaling pathways involved. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CALCINEURIN B-LIKE PROTEIN-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE19 (CIPK19) as an important element to pollen tube growth through a functional survey for CIPK family members. The CIPK19 gene was specifically expressed in pollen grains and pollen tubes, and its overexpression induced severe loss of polarity in pollen tube growth. In the CIPK19 loss-of-function mutant, tube growth and polarity were significantly impaired, as demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth assays. Genetic analysis indicated that disruption of CIPK19 resulted in a male-specific transmission defect. Furthermore, loss of polarity induced by CIPK19 overexpression was associated with elevated cytosolic Ca2+ throughout the bulging tip, whereas LaCl3, a Ca2+ influx blocker, rescued CIPK19 overexpression-induced growth inhibition. Our results suggest that CIPK19 may be involved in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis through its potential function in the modulation of Ca2+ influx.
