Vacuoles are versatile organelles in plant cells, critical for growth and responses to environmental cues. Vacuoles are dynamic tubular structures in pollen tubes, the male gametophytes. Mutations at vacuolar fusion machinery caused male gametophytic lethality by affecting pollen tube growth and guidance, which are critical steps leading to angiosperm reproduction. In comparison, the role of vacuolar trafficking and its cargoes in this process is less understood. In this mini-review, we summarize old and recent findings that indicate the involvement of vacuolar trafficking in pollen tube growth and guidance. We also point at future studies that would provide insights into a key role of vacuolar trafficking and its cargos in pollen tube growth and guidance.
