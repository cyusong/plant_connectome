Freezing tolerance is an important feature for plant survival during winter. In plants, extracellular freezing occurs at subzero temperatures, resulting in dehydration and mechanical stresses upon the plasma membrane. However, many plants can acquire enhanced freezing tolerance by exposure to non-freezing temperatures, which is referred to as cold acclimation. The plasma membrane is the primary site of freezing injury. During cold acclimation, the lipid composition in the plasma membrane changes, which may protect the plasma membrane from injuries caused by freeze-induced dehydration stress (e.g., phase transition). Recently, we have examined the behavior of the plasma membrane during the freezing process using protoplasts isolated from cold-acclimated Arabidopsis leaves. The observations indicate that the cryobehavior of the plasma membrane after cold acclimation may act to resist the mechanical stress caused by freezing.
