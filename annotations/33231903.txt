Plant hormones play important roles in plant growth and development and physiology, and in acclimation to environmental changes. The hormone signaling networks are highly complex and interconnected. It is thus important to not only know where the hormones are produced, how they are transported and how and where they are perceived, but also to monitor their distribution quantitatively, ideally in a non-invasive manner. Here we summarize the diverse set of tools available for quantifying and visualizing hormone distribution and dynamics. We provide an overview over the tools that are currently available, including transcriptional reporters, degradation sensors, and luciferase and fluorescent sensors, and compare the tools and their suitability for different purposes.
