['27848912', 'In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal  egg and central cells with two paternal sperm cells, leading to the formation of  embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by  the maternally derived seed coat, whose development prior to fertilization is  blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group (PcG) protein  family. Here we show that fertilization of the central cell results in the  production of auxin and most likely its export to the maternal tissues, which  drives seed coat development by removing PcG function. We furthermore show that  mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have an impaired transport of  auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, which results in seed abortion. We  propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the  integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development.', '2016 Nov 16', 'Elife', '10.7554/eLife.20542', 'Kohler']
