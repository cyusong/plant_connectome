Elevated temperatures during berry ripening have been shown to affect grape quality. The crop forcing technique (summer pruning that 'force' the vine to start a new cycle) has been shown to improve berry quality by delaying the harvest date. However, yield is typically reduced on forced vines, which is attributed to vine low carbon availability soon after forcing and likely incomplete inflorescence formation. The present study aims to estimate the carbon balance of forced vines and evaluate vine responses to changes in carbon patterns due to forcing. Three treatments were studied on Tempranillo cultivar: non-forced vines (Control), vines forced shortly after fruit set (CF<sub>early</sub>) and vines forced one month later at the beginning of bunch closure (CF<sub>late</sub>). Whole canopy net carbon exchange was modelled and validated using two whole canopy gas exchange chambers. In addition, non-structural carbohydrate reserves at budburst, forcing date and harvest, were analysed. Yield, yield components and vegetative growth were also evaluated. Harvest date was delayed by one and two months in the CF<sub>early</sub> and CF<sub>late</sub>, respectively, which increased must acidity. However, yield was lower in the forced treatments compared to the Control (49% lower for CF<sub>early</sub> and 82% for CF<sub>late</sub>). In the second year, at the time when CF<sub>early</sub> and CF<sub>late</sub> dormant buds were unlocked (forced budburst), forced vines had significantly lower non-structural carbohydrates than Control vines at budburst. Although the time elapsed from budburst to reach maximum net carbon exchange was longer for the Control treatment (80 days) than for the forced treatments (about 40 days), average daily net carbon exchange until harvest was comparable between Control (60.9 g CO<sub>2</sub>/vine/day) and CF<sub>early</sub> (55.9 g CO<sub>2</sub>/vine/day), but not for CF<sub>late</sub> (38.7 g CO<sub>2</sub>/vine/day). In addition, the time elapsed from budburst to harvest was shorter in forced treatments (about 124 days) than for the Control (172 days). As a result, the cumulative net carbon exchange until harvest was reduced by 35% (CF<sub>early</sub>) and 55% (CF<sub>late</sub>) in the forced treatments. However, no differences in carbon reserves at harvest were observed between treatments partly helped by the higher source:sink ratio observed in forced than Control vines.
