['19151224', 'Early endosperm development involves a series of rapid nuclear divisions in the  absence of cytokinesis; thus, many endosperm mutants reveal genes whose functions  are essential for mitosis. This work finds that the endosperm of Arabidopsis  thaliana endosperm-defective1 (ede1) mutants never cellularizes, contains a  reduced number of enlarged polyploid nuclei, and features an aberrant microtubule  cytoskeleton, where the specialized radial microtubule systems and cytokinetic  phragmoplasts are absent. Early embryo development is substantially normal,  although occasional cytokinesis defects are observed. The EDE1 gene was cloned  using a map-based approach and represents the pioneer member of a conserved  plant-specific family of genes of previously unknown function. EDE1 is expressed  in the endosperm and embryo of developing seeds, and its expression is tightly  regulated during cell cycle progression. EDE1 protein accumulates in nuclear caps  in premitotic cells, colocalizes along microtubules of the spindle and  phragmoplast, and binds microtubules in vitro. We conclude that EDE1 is a novel  plant-specific microtubule-associated protein essential for microtubule function  during the mitotic and cytokinetic stages that generate the Arabidopsis endosperm  and embryo.', '2009 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.061812', 'Hills']
