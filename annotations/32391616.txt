Fruit crops are subject to precocious fruit abscission, during which the phytohormone ethylene (ET) acts as a major positive regulator. However, the molecular basis of ET-induced fruit abscission remains poorly understood. Here, we show that two ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3-like (EIL) homologs in litchi, LcEIL2 and LcEIL3, play a role in ET-activated fruitlet abscission. LcEIL2/3 were significantly upregulated in the fruit abscission zone (AZ) during the ET-induced fruitlet abscission in litchi. The presence of LcEIL2/3 in wild-type Arabidopsis and ein3 eil1 mutants can accelerate the floral organ abscission. Moreover, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and dual luciferase reporter analysis illustrated that LcEIL2/3 directly interacted with the gene promoters to activate the expression of cell wall remodeling genes LcCEL2/8 and LcPG1/2, and ET biosynthetic genes LcACS1/4/7 and LcACO2/3. Furthermore, we showed that LcPG1/2 were expressed in the floral abscission zone of Arabidopsis, and constitutive expression of LcPG2 in Arabidopsis promoted the floral organ abscission. In conclusion, we propose that LcEIL2/3 are involved in ET-induced fruitlet abscission via controlling expression of genes related to ET biosynthesis and cell wall remodeling in litchi.
