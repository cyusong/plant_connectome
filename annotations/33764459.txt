Enhancers located in introns are abundant and play a major role in the regulation of gene expression in mammalian species. By contrast, the functions of intronic enhancers in plants have largely been unexplored and only a handful of plant intronic enhancers have been reported. We performed a genome-wide prediction of intronic enhancers in Arabidopsis thaliana using open chromatin signatures based on DNase I sequencing. We identified 941 candidate intronic enhancers associated with 806 genes in seedling tissue and 1,271 intronic enhancers associated with 1,069 genes in floral tissue. We validated the function of 15 of 21 (71%) of the predicted intronic enhancers in transgenic assays using a reporter gene. We also created deletion lines of three intronic enhancers associated with two different genes using CRISPR/Cas. Deletion of these enhancers, which span key transcription factor binding sites, did not abolish gene expression but caused varying levels of transcriptional repression of their cognate genes. Remarkably, the transcriptional repression of the deletion lines occurred at specific developmental stages and resulted in distinct phenotypic effects on plant morphology and development. Clearly, these three intronic enhancers are important in fine-tuning tissue- and development-specific expression of their cognate genes.
