During cytokinesis in brown algal cells, Golgi-derived vesicles (GVs) and flat cisternae (FCs) are involved in building the new cell partition membrane. In this study, we followed the membrane fusion process in Silvetia babingtonii zygotes using electron microscopy together with rapid freezing and freeze substitution. After mitosis, many FCs were formed around endoplasmic reticulum clusters and these then spread toward the future cytokinetic plane. Actin depolymerization using latrunculin B prevented the appearance of the FCs. Fusion of GVs to FCs resulted in structures that were thicker and more elongated (EFCs; expanded flat cisternae). Some complicated membranous structures (MN; membranous network) were formed by interconnection of EFCs and following the arrival of additional GVs. The MN grew into membranous sacs (MSs) as gaps between the MNs disappeared. The MSs were observed in patches along the cytokinetic plane. Neighboring MSs were united to form the new cell partition membrane. An immunocytochemical analysis indicated that fucoidan was synthesized in Golgi bodies and transported by vesicles to the future cytokinetic plane, where the vesicles fused with the FCs. Alginate was not detected until the MS phase. Incubation of sections with cellulase-gold showed that the cellulose content of the new cross wall was not comparable to that of the parent cell wall.
