High temperature-induced bolting of lettuce is undesirable agriculturally, making it important to find the mechanism governing the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes play important roles in the induction of flowering in several plant species. To clarify floral induction in lettuce, we isolated the FT gene (LsFT) from lettuce. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationships of LsFT revealed considerable homology to FT genes of Arabidopsis, tomato, and other species. LsFT induced early flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis, but was not completely effective compared to AtFT. LsFT mRNA was abundant in the largest leaves under flowering-inducible conditions (higher temperatures). Gene expression was correlated with flower differentiation of the shoot apical meristem. Our results suggest that LsFT is a putative FT homolog in lettuce that regulates flower transition, similar to its homolog in Arabidopsis. This is the first information on the lettuce floral gene for elucidating regulation of the flowering transition in lettuce.
