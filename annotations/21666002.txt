['21666002', 'Sphingolipids are a class of structural membrane lipids involved in membrane  trafficking and cell polarity. Functional analysis of the ceramide synthase  family in Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrates the existence of two activities  selective for the length of the acyl chains. Very-long-acyl-chain (C > 18  carbons) but not long-chain sphingolipids are essential for plant development.  Reduction of very-long-chain fatty acid sphingolipid levels leads in particular  to auxin-dependent inhibition of lateral root emergence that is associated with  selective aggregation of the plasma membrane auxin carriers AUX1 and PIN1 in the  cytosol. Defective targeting of polar auxin carriers is characterized by specific  aggregation of Rab-A2(a)- and Rab-A1(e)-labeled early endosomes along the  secretory pathway. These aggregates correlate with the accumulation of membrane  structures and vesicle fragmentation in the cytosol. In conclusion, sphingolipids  with very long acyl chains define a trafficking pathway with specific  endomembrane compartments and polar auxin transport protein cargoes.', '2011 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.080473', 'Faure']
