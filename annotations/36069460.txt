Vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase (V-ATPase) has diverse functions related to plant development and growth. It creates the turgor pressure that drives cell growth by generating the energy needed for the active transport of solutes across the tonoplast. V-ATPase is a large protein complex made up of multiheteromeric subunits, some of which have unknown functions. In this study, a forward genetics-based strategy was employed to identify the vab3 mutant, which displayed resistance to isoxaben, a cellulose synthase inhibitor that could induce excessive transverse cell expansion. Map-based cloning and genetic complementary assays demonstrated that V-ATPase B subunit 3 (VAB3) is associated with the observed insensitivity of the mutant to isoxaben. Analysis of the vab3 mutant revealed defective ionic homeostasis and hypersensitivity to salt stress. Treatment with a V-ATPase inhibitor exacerbated ionic tolerance and cell elongation defects in the vab3 mutant. Notably, exogenous low-dose Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> could partially restore isoxaben resistance of the vab3 mutant, suggesting a relationship between VAB3-regulated cell growth and ion homeostasis. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that the V-ATPase subunit VAB3 is required for cell growth and ion homeostasis in Arabidopsis.
