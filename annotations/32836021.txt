NtabSPL6-2 of Nicotiana tabacum was introduced into Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium-mediated floral-dip method. Compared to wild-type Col-0 plants, the arrangement of cauline leaves in NtabSPL6-2 transgenic plants was converted into opposite from simple and alternate, and the margin of rosette leaves was serrated. NtabSPL6-2 transgenic plants possessed a significantly greater fresh weight. Subcellular localization by fusion with GFP confirmed that the encoded product of NtabSPL6-2 existed in the nucleus. The leaves of NtabSPL6-2 transgenic plants exhibited an enhanced capacity to restrain the bacterial reproduction after infection by Pseudomonas syringae, accompanied by higher expression of the pathogenesis-related gene PR1 in the infiltrated leaves, indicating NtabSPL6-2 could improve the defense response of Arabidopsis to P. syringae at the local sites. Similarly, it was confirmed that NtabSPL6-2 could enhance the systemic acquired resistance of Arabidopsis in response to P. syringae. In addition, the area of necrotic plaque appearing on the transgenic leaves inoculated with Botrytis cinerea was smaller and accompanied by an upregulation of PR1 and PR5, indicating NtabSPL6-2 transgenic leaves were less susceptible to the fungal pathogen. Moreover, there was less accumulation of reactive oxygen species (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sup>2-</sup>) and malondialdehyde in the local infected sites of transgenic plants, whereas the wild-type Col-0 plants were more oxidatively injured after infestation by B. cinerea.
