['15458645', 'Plant architecture is regulated by endogenous developmental programs, but it can  also be strongly influenced by cues derived from the environment. For example,  rhizosphere conditions such as water and nutrient availability affect shoot and  root architecture; this implicates the root as a source of signals that can  override endogenous developmental programs. Cytokinin, abscisic acid, and  carotenoid derivatives have all been implicated as long-distance signals that can  be derived from the root. However, little is known about how root-derived  signaling pathways are regulated. Here, we show that BYPASS1 (BPS1), an  Arabidopsis gene of unknown function, is required to prevent constitutive  production of a root-derived graft-transmissible signal that is sufficient to  inhibit leaf initiation, leaf expansion, and shoot apical meristem activity. We  show that this root-derived signal is likely to be a novel carotenoid-derived  molecule that can modulate both root and shoot architecture.', '2004 Oct 5', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2004.09.045', 'Sieburth']
