The use of CRISPR/LbCpf1 and CRISPR/xCas9 systems in wheat have not yet been reported. In this study, we compared the efficiencies of three CRISPR editing systems (SpCas9, LbCpf1, and xCas9), and three different promoters (OsU6a, TaU3, and TaU6) that drive single-guide (sg)RNA, which were introduced into wheat via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The results indicated that TaU3 was a better choice than OsU6a or TaU6. The editing efficiency was higher using two sgRNAs than one sgRNA, and mutants with a large fragment deletion between the two sgRNAs were produced. The LbCpf1 and xCas9 systems could both be used successfully. Two endogenous genes, TaWaxy and TaMTL, were edited with high efficiency by the optimized SpCas9 system, with the highest efficiency (80.5%) being achieved when using TaU3 and two sgRNAs to target TaWaxy. Rates of seed set in the TaMTL-edited T0 transgenic plants were much lower than that of the wild-type. A haploid induction rate of 18.9% was found in the TaMTL-edited T1 plants using the CRISPR/SpCas9 system. Mutants with reverse insertion of the deleted sequences of TaMTL and TaWaxy between the two sgRNAs were identified in the edited T0 plants. In addition, wheat grains lacking embryos or endosperms were observed in the TaMTL-edited T1 generation.
