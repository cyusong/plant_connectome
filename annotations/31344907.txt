['31344907', 'In plants, much like in animals, nitric oxide (NO) has been established as an  important gaseous signaling molecule. However, contrary to animal systems,  NO-sensitive or NO-responsive proteins that bind NO in the form of a sensor or  participating in redox reactions have remained elusive. Here, we applied a search  term constructed based on conserved and functionally annotated amino acids at the  centers of Heme Nitric Oxide/Oxygen (H-NOX) domains in annotated and  experimentally-tested gas-binding proteins from lower and higher eukaryotes, in  order to identify candidate NO-binding proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. The  selection of candidate NO-binding proteins identified from the motif search was  supported by structural modeling. This approach identified AtLRB3 (At4g01160), a  member of the Light Response Bric-a-Brac/Tramtrack/Broad Complex (BTB) family, as  a candidate NO-binding protein. AtLRB3 was heterologously expressed and purified,  and then tested for NO-response. Spectroscopic data confirmed that AtLRB3  contains a histidine-ligated heme cofactor and importantly, the addition of NO to  AtLRB3 yielded absorption characteristics reminiscent of canonical H-NOX  proteins. Furthermore, substitution of the heme iron-coordinating histidine at  the H-NOX center with a leucine strongly impaired the NO-response. Our finding  therefore established AtLRB3 as a NO-interacting protein and future  characterizations will focus on resolving the nature of this response.', '2019 Jul 24', 'Molecules', '10.3390/molecules24152691', 'Gehring']
