Aphids are important pests of wheat (Triticum aestivum) that affect crop production globally. Herbivore-induced emission of sesquiterpenes can repel pests, and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPS) is a key enzyme involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis. However, fps orthologues in wheat and their functional roles in sesquiterpene synthesis and defence against aphid infestation are unknown. Here, two fps isoforms, Tafps1 and Tafps2, were identified in wheat. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in vitro catalytic activity analyses were conducted to investigate expression patterns and activity. Heterologous expression of these isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in wheat and aphid behavioural assays were performed to understand the functional roles of these two isoforms. We demonstrated that Tafps1 and Tafps2 played different roles in induced responses to aphid infestation and in sesquiterpene synthesis. Heterologous expression in A. thaliana resulted in repulsion of the peach aphid (Myzus persicae). Wheat plants with these two isoforms transiently silenced were significantly attractive to grain aphid (Sitobion avenae). Our results provide new insights into induced defence against aphid herbivory in wheat, in particular, the different roles of the two Tafps isoforms in both sesquiterpene biosynthesis and defence against aphid infestation.
