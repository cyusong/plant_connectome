Melatonin is a new plant hormone involved in multiple physiological functions in plants such as germination, photosynthesis, plant growth, flowering, fruiting, and senescence, among others. Its protective role in different stress situations, both biotic and abiotic, has been widely demonstrated. Melatonin regulates several routes in primary and secondary plant metabolism through the up/down-regulation of many enzyme/factor genes. Many of the steps of nitrogen metabolism in plants are also regulated by melatonin and are presented in this review. In addition, the ability of melatonin to enhance nitrogen uptake under nitrogen-excess or nitrogen-low conditions is analyzed. A model that summarizes the distribution of nitrogen compounds, and the osmoregulation and redox network responses mediated by melatonin, are presented. The possibilities of using melatonin in crops for more efficient uptake, the assimilation and metabolization of nitrogen from soil, and the implications for Nitrogen Use Efficiency strategies to improve crop yield are also discussed.
