['27612205', 'The endoplasmic reticulum body (ER body) is an organelle derived from the ER that  occurs in only three families of the order Brassicales and is suggested to be  involved in plant defense. ER bodies in Arabidopsis thaliana contain large  amounts of beta-glucosidases, but the physiological functions of ER bodies and these  enzymes remain largely unclear. Here we show that PYK10, the most abundant  beta-glucosidase in A. thaliana root ER bodies, hydrolyzes indole glucosinolates  (IGs) in addition to the previously reported in vitro substrate scopolin. We  found a striking co-expression between ER body-related genes (including PYK10),  glucosinolate biosynthetic genes and the genes for so-called specifier proteins  affecting the terminal products of myrosinase-mediated glucosinolate metabolism,  indicating that these systems have been integrated into a common transcriptional  network. Consistent with this, comparative metabolite profiling utilizing a  number of A. thaliana relatives within Brassicaceae identified a clear  phylogenetic co-occurrence between ER bodies and IGs, but not between ER bodies  and scopolin. Collectively, our findings suggest a functional link between ER  bodies and glucosinolate metabolism in planta. In addition, in silico  three-dimensional modeling, combined with phylogenomic analysis, suggests that  PYK10 represents a clade of 16 myrosinases that arose independently from the  other well-documented class of six thioglucoside glucohydrolases. These findings  provide deeper insights into how glucosinolates are metabolized in cruciferous  plants and reveal variation of the myrosinase-glucosinolate system within  individual plants.', '2017 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13377', 'ORCID:']
