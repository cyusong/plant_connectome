Zinc finger proteins are widely involved and play an important role in plant growth and abiotic stress. In this research, <i>MdZAT5</i>, a gene encoding C2H2-type zinc finger protein, was cloned and investigated. The <i>MdZAT5</i> was highly expressed in flower tissues by qRT-PCR analyses and GUS staining. Promoter analysis showed that <i>MdZAT5</i> contained multiple response elements, and the expression levels of <i>MdZAT5</i> were induced by various abiotic stress treatments. Overexpression of <i>MdZAT5</i> in apple calli positively regulated anthocyanin accumulation by activating the expressions of anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes. Overexpression of <i>MdZAT5</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> also enhanced the accumulation of anthocyanin. In addition, <i>MdZAT5</i> increased the sensitivity to salt stress in apple calli. Ectopic expression of <i>MdZAT5</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> reduced the expression of salt-stress-related genes (<i>AtNHX1</i> and <i>AtABI1</i>) and improved the sensitivity to salt stress. In conclusion, these results suggest that <i>MdZAT5</i> plays a positive regulatory role in anthocyanin accumulation and negatively regulates salt resistance.
