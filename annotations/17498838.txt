Chloroplast protein synthesis elongation factor, EF-Tu, has been implicated in heat tolerance in maize (Zea mays). Chloroplast EF-Tu is highly conserved, and it is possible that this protein may be of importance to heat tolerance in other species including wheat (Triticum aestivum). In this study, we assessed heat tolerance and determined the relative levels of EF-Tu in mature plants (at flowering stage) of 12 cultivars of winter wheat experiencing a 16-d-long heat treatment (36/30 degrees C, day/night temperature). In addition, we also investigated the expression of EF-Tu in young plants experiencing a short-term heat shock (4h at 43 degrees C). Heat tolerance was assessed by examining the stability of thylakoid membranes, measuring chlorophyll content, and assessing plant growth traits (shoot dry mass, plant height, tiller number, and ear number). In mature plants, relative levels of EF-Tu were determined after 7 d of heat stress. High temperature-induced accumulation of EF-Tu in mature plants of all cultivars, and a group of cultivars that showed greater accumulation of EF-Tu displayed better tolerance to heat stress. Young plants of all cultivars but one did not show significant increases in the relative levels of EF-Tu. The results of the study suggest that EF-Tu protein may play a role in heat tolerance in winter wheat.
