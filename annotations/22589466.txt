Meiosis ensures the reduction of the genome before the formation of generative cells and promotes the exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes by recombination. Essential for these events are programmed DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) providing single-stranded DNA overhangs after their processing. These overhangs, together with the RADiation sensitive51 (RAD51) and DMC1 Disrupted Meiotic cDNA1 (DMC1) recombinases, mediate the search for homologous sequences. Current models propose that the two ends flanking a meiotic DSB have different fates during DNA repair, but the molecular details remained elusive. Here we present evidence, obtained in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, that the two recombinases, RAD51 and DMC1, localize to opposite sides of a meiotic DSB. We further demonstrate that the ATR kinase is involved in regulating DMC1 deposition at meiotic DSB sites, and that its elimination allows DMC1-mediated meiotic DSB repair even in the absence of RAD51. DMC1's ability to promote interhomolog DSB repair is not a property of the protein itself but the consequence of an ASYNAPTIC1 (Hop1)-mediated impediment for intersister repair. Taken together, these results demonstrate that DMC1 functions independently and spatially separated from RAD51 during meiosis and that ATR is an integral part of the regular meiotic program.
