Petal color in <i>Zinnia elegans</i> is characterized mainly by anthocyanin accumulation. The difference in the content of anthocyanins, especially cyanidins, affects petal coloration in <i>Z. elegans</i>, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report one R2R3-MYB transcription factor from subgroup 6, ZeMYB9, acting as a positive regulator of anthocyanin accumulation in <i>Z. elegans</i>. Up-regulated expression of <i>ZeMYB9</i> and flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase gene (<i>ZeF3'H</i>) was detected in the cultivar with higher cyanidin content. ZeMYB9 could specifically activate the promoter of <i>ZeF3'H</i>, and over-expression of <i>ZeMYB9</i> induces much greater anthocyanin accumulation and higher expression level of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in both petunia and tobacco. And then, ZeMYB9 was demonstrated to interact with ZeGL3, a bHLH transcription factor belonging to IIIf subgroup. Promoter activity of <i>ZeF3'H</i> was significantly promoted by co-expressing <i>ZeMYB9</i> and <i>ZeGL3</i> compared with expressing <i>ZeMYB9</i> alone. Moreover, transient co-expression of <i>ZeMYB9</i> and <i>ZeGL3</i> induced anthocyanin accumulation in tobacco leaves. Our results suggest that ZeMYB9 could enhance cyanidin synthesis and regulate petal color in <i>Z. elegans</i> though activating the expression of <i>ZeF3'H</i>, by itself or interacting with ZeGL3.
