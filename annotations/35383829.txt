S-adenosyl- l-methionine (SAM) is the methyl donor involved in the biosynthesis of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) lignins in vascular plants. SAM is synthesized from methionine through the catalysis of the enzyme S-adenosylmethionine synthase (SAMS). However, the detailed function of SAMS in lignin biosynthesis has not been widely investigated in plants, particularly in monocot species. In this study, we identified PvSAMS genes from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), an important dual-purpose fodder and biofuel crop, and generated numerous transgenic switchgrass lines through PvSAMS RNA interference technology. Down-regulation of PvSAMS reduced the contents of SAM, G-lignins, and S-lignins in the transgenic switchgrass. The methionine and glucoside derivatives of caffeoyl alcohol were found to accumulate in the transgenic plants. Moreover, down-regulation of PvSAMS in switchgrass resulted in brownish stems associated with reduced lignin content and improved cell wall digestibility. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed that most sulfur deficiency-responsive genes were differentially expressed in the transgenic switchgrass, leading to a significant increase in total sulfur content; thus implying an important role of SAMS in the methionine cycle, lignin biosynthesis, and sulfur assimilation. Taken together, our results suggest that SAMS is a valuable target in lignin manipulation, and that manipulation of PvSAMS can simultaneously regulate the biosynthesis of SAM and methylated monolignols in switchgrass.
