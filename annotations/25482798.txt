During plant growth and development, root tip performs multifarious functions integrating diverse external and internal stimuli to regulate root elongation and architecture. It is believed that a signal originating from root tip inhibits lateral root formation (LRF). The excision of root tip induced LRF in tomato seedlings associated with accumulation of auxin in pericycle founder cells. The excision of cotyledons slightly reduced LRF, whereas severing shoot from root completely abolished LRF. Exogenous ethylene application did not alter LRF. The response was modulated by light with higher LRF in seedlings exposed to light. Our results indicate that light plays a role in LRF in seedlings by likely modulating shoot derived auxin.
