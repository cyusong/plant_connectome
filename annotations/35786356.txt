Microspore transfers the developmental fate into embryogenesis in vitro regulated by determinant factors of stress-induced. However, the key regulators of microspore embryogenesis (ME) are still largely undiscovered to reveal the mechanism of cell fate transition. Here, we report that Phospholipase C (PLC) is involved at the early stages of ME in <i>Nicotiana tabacum. NtPLC2/3/4</i> are expressed at the initial stages of ME. The expression levels of <i>NtPLC2/3</i> are transient activated after 3 days in culture, while the expression level of <i>NtPLC4</i> maintains relatively stable. Inhibition of PLCs induces the decrease in <i>NtPLC2/3/4</i> expression level and decline of ME yield. We confirm that lipids in microspore are degraded and then re-accumulate at first embryonic division stage. Inhibition of PLCs suppresses the lipids metabolism at the early stages of ME. Thus, we propose that PLCs-mediated lipid metabolism is a novel regulator at the early stages of ME.

NtPLC2/3/4: !are expressed! at early stages of ME
NtPLC2/3: !are transiently activated! after 3 days in culture
NtPLC4: !maintains stable expression level!
Inhibition of PLCs: !induces decrease! in NtPLC2/3/4 expression level
Lipids: !are degraded and re-accumulate! at first embryonic division stage
Inhibition of PLCs: !suppresses lipid metabolism! at early stages of ME
PLCs: !mediate lipid metabolism! as novel regulator at early stages of ME
