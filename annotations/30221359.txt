Photosynthesis in non-foliar organs plays an important role in crop growth and productivity, and it has received considerable research attention in recent years. However, compared with the capability of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in leaves, the distinct attributes of photosynthesis in the non-foliar organs of wheat (a C<sub>3</sub> species) are unclear. This review presents a comprehensive examination of the photosynthetic characteristics of non-foliar organs in wheat. Compared with leaves, non-foliar organs had a higher capacity to refix respired CO<sub>2</sub> , higher tolerance to environmental stresses and slower terminal senescence after anthesis. Additionally, whether C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic metabolism exists in the non-foliar organs of wheat is discussed, as is the advantage of photosynthesis in non-foliar organs during times of abiotic stress. Introducing the photosynthesis-related genes of C<sub>4</sub> plants into wheat, which are specifically expressed in non-foliar organs, can be a promising approach for improving wheat productivity.
