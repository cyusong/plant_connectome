Understanding of mechanistic details of Mediator functioning in plants is impeded as the knowledge of subunit organization and structure is lacking. In this study, an interaction map of Arabidopsis Mediator complex was analyzed to understand the arrangement of the subunits in the core part of the complex. Combining this interaction map with homology-based modeling, probable structural topology of core part of the Arabidopsis Mediator complex was deduced. Though the overall topology of the complex was similar to that of yeast, several differences were observed. Many interactions discovered in this study are not yet reported in other systems. AtMed14 and AtMed17 emerged as the key component providing important scaffold for the whole complex. AtMed6 and AtMed10 were found to be important for linking head with middle and middle with tail, respectively. Some Mediator subunits were found to form homodimers and some were found to possess transactivation property. Subcellular localization suggested that many of the Mediator subunits might have functions beyond the process of transcription. Overall, this study reveals role of individual subunits in the organization of the core complex, which can be an important resource for understanding the molecular mechanism of functioning of Mediator complex and its subunits in plants.
