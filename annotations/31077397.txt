High concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon in stems of herbaceous and woody C<sub>3</sub> plants exit leaves in the dark. In the light, C<sub>3</sub> species use a small portion of xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> for leaf photosynthesis. However, it is not known if xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> will exit leaves in the dark or be used for photosynthesis in the light in Kranz-type C<sub>4</sub> plants. Cut leaves of Amaranthus hypochondriacus were placed in one of three solutions of [NaH<sup>13</sup> CO<sub>3</sub> ] dissolved in KCl water to measure the efflux of xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> exiting the leaf in the dark or rates of assimilation of xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> * in the light, in real-time, using a tunable diode laser absorption spectroscope. In the dark, the efflux of xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> increased with increasing rates of transpiration and [<sup>13</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> *]; however, rates of <sup>13</sup> C<sub>efflux</sub> in A. hypochondriacus were lower compared to C<sub>3</sub> species. In the light, A. hypochondriacus fixed nearly 75% of the xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> supplied to the leaf. Kranz anatomy and biochemistry likely influence the efflux of xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> out of cut leaves of A. hypochondriacus in the dark, as well as the use of xylem-transported CO<sub>2</sub> * for photosynthesis in the light. Thus increasing the carbon use efficiency of Kranz-type C<sub>4</sub> species over C<sub>3</sub> species.
