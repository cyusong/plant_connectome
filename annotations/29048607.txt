ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to alter the structure of chromatin and are important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. One such factor encoded by CHR5 (Chromatin-Remodeling Factor 5) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was previously found to be involved in regulation of growth and development. Here we show that CHR5 is required for the up-regulation of the intracellular immune receptor gene SNC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF npr1-1, CONSTITUTIVE1) and consequently the autoimmunity induced by SNC1 up-regulation. CHR5 functions antagonistically with another chromatin-remodeling gene DDM1 (DECREASED DNA METHYLATION 1) and independently with a histone mono-ubiquitinase HUB1 (HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION 1) in SNC1 regulation. In addition, CHR5 is a positive regulator of SNC1-independent plant immunity against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Furthermore, the chr5 mutant has increased nucleosome occupancy in the promoter region relative to the gene body region at the whole-genome level, suggesting a global role for CHR5 in remodeling nucleosome occupancy. Our study thus establishes CHR5 as a positive regulator of plant immune responses including the expression of SNC1 and reveals a role for CHR5 in nucleosome occupancy which probably impacts gene expression genome wide.
