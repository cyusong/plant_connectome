Organismal communication entails encoding a message that is sent over space or time to a recipient cell, where that message is decoded to activate a downstream response. Defining what qualifies as a functional signal is essential for understanding intercellular communication. In this review, we delve into what is known and unknown in the field of long-distance messenger RNA (mRNA) movement and draw inspiration from the field of information theory to provide a perspective on what defines a functional signaling molecule. Although numerous studies support the long-distance movement of hundreds to thousands of mRNAs through the plant vascular system, only a small handful of these transcripts have been associated with signaling functions. Deciphering whether mobile mRNAs generally serve a role in plant communication has been challenging, due to our current lack of understanding regarding the factors that influence mRNA mobility. Further insight into unsolved questions regarding the nature of mobile mRNAs could provide an understanding of the signaling potential of these macromolecules.
