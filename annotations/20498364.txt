['20498364', 'The correct localization of integral membrane proteins to subcellular  compartments is important for their functions. Synaptotagmin contains a single  transmembrane domain that functions as a type I signal-anchor sequence in its N  terminus and two calcium-binding domains (C(2)A and C(2)B) in its C terminus.  Here, we demonstrate that the localization of an Arabidopsis synaptotagmin  homolog, SYT1, to the plasma membrane (PM) is modulated by tandem C2 domains. An  analysis of the roots of a transformant-expressing green fluorescent  protein-tagged SYT1 driven by native SYT1 promoter suggested that SYT1 is  synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, and then delivered to the PM via the  exocytotic pathway. We transiently expressed a series of truncated proteins in  protoplasts, and determined that tandem C(2)A-C(2)B domains were necessary for  the localization of SYT1 to the PM. The PM localization of SYT1 was greatly  reduced following mutation of the calcium-binding motifs of the C(2)B domain,  based on sequence comparisons with other homologs, such as endomembrane-localized  SYT5. The localization of SYT1 to the PM may have been required for the  functional divergence that occurred in the molecular evolution of plant  synaptotagmins.', '2010 Jul 23', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M109.084046', 'Kawamura']
