Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a plant defense response in which an initial localized infection affords enhanced pathogen resistance to distant, uninfected leaves. SAR requires efficient long-distance signaling between the infected leaf, where SAR signals are generated, and the distant uninfected leaves that receive them. A growing body of evidence indicates that the lipid transfer protein DIR1 (Defective in Induced Resistance) is an important mediator of long-distance SAR signaling. In a recent publication, we investigated if cell-to-cell movement through plasmodesmata is required for long-distance movement of DIR1 during SAR. We determined that overexpression of Plasmodesmata-Located Proteins (PDLP1 and 5) negatively impacted long-distance DIR1 movement and SAR competence, suggesting that movement through plasmodesmata contributes to long-distance signal movement during SAR.
