['11877383', 'The germination of Arabidopsis seeds is promoted by gibberellin (GA). Arabidopsis  GAI, and RGA are genes encoding key GA signal-transduction components (GAI and  RGA) that mediate GA regulation of stem elongation. The Arabidopsis genome  contains two further genes, RGL1 and RGL2, that encode proteins (RGL1 and RGL2)  that are closely related to GAI and RGA. Here, we show that RGL2 regulates seed  germination in response to GA, and that RGL1, GAI, and RGA do not. In addition,  we show that RGL2 transcript levels rise rapidly following seed imbibition, and  then decline rapidly as germination proceeds. In situ GUS staining revealed that  RGL2 expression in imbibed seeds is restricted to elongating regions of  pre-emergent and recently emerged radicles. These observations indicate that RGL2  is a negative regulator of GA responses that acts specifically to control seed  germination rather than stem elongation. Furthermore, as RGL2 expression is  imbibition inducible, RGL2 may function as an integrator of environmental and  endogenous cues to control seed germination.', '2002 Mar 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.969002', 'Peng']
