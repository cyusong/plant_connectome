Genome size is known to influence phenotypic traits in leaves and seeds. Although genome size is closely related to cellular and developmental traits across biological kingdoms, floral longevity is a floral trait with important fitness consequence, but less is known about the link between floral longevity and sizes of genomes and cells. In this study, we examined evolutionary coordination between genome size, floral longevity, and epidermal cell size in flowers and leaves in 13 <i>Paphiopedilum</i> species. We found that, across all the study species, the genome size was positively correlated with floral longevity but negatively associated with labellum epidermal cell size, and a negative relationship was found between floral longevity and labellum epidermal cell size. This suggested that genome size is potentially correlated with floral longevity, and genome size has an important impact on life-history trait. In addition, genome size was positively correlated with leaf epidermal cell size, which was different from the relationship in flower due to different selective pressures they experienced or different functions they performed. Therefore, genome size constraints floral longevity, and it is a strong predictor of cell size. The impact of genome size on reproduction might have more implications for the evolution of flowering plants and pollination ecology.
