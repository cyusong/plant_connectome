Possible mechanisms behind the light-induced wilting of dark-germinated pea (Pisum sativum L.) epicotyls were studied. Illumination with photosynthetically active radiation caused a fast turgor loss and wilting in the middle segments of the epicotyls accompanied by accumulation of water in the intercellular cavities. During this process, room temperature fluorescence emission spectra showed gradual bleaching of porphyrin-type pigments, which was lessened by incubating the epicotyls with excess ascorbate before illumination. Detection of singlet oxygen and lipid peroxidation products in the illuminated epicotyls suggested the occurrence of porphyrin-photosenzitized membrane damage as a cause of disordered water status and sequential wilting.
