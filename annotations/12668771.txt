['12668771', 'Lesion mimic mutants develop spontaneous cell death without pathogen attack. Some  of the genes defined by these mutations may function as regulators of cell death,  whereas others may perturb cellular metabolism in a way that leads to cell death.  To understand the molecular mechanism of cell death in lesion mimic mutants, we  isolated a lesion initiation 1 (len1) mutant by a T-DNA tagging method. The len1  mutant develops lesions on its leaves and expresses systemic acquired resistance  (SAR). LEN1 was identified to encode a chloroplast chaperonin 60 beta (Cpn60  beta), a homologue of bacterial GroEL. The recombinant LEN1 had molecular  chaperone activity for suppressing protein aggregation in vitro. Moreover, len1  plants develop accelerated cell death to heat shock stress in comparison with  wild-type plants. The chlorophyll a/b binding protein (CAB) was present in len1  plants at a lower level than in the wild-type plants. These results indicate that  LEN1 functions as a molecular chaperone in chloroplasts and its deletion leads to  cell death in Arabidopsis.', '2003 Mar', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcg031', 'Asahi']
