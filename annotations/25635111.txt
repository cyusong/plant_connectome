Leaves are ideal model systems to study the organ size regulation of multicellular plants. Leaf cell number and cell size are determinant factors of leaf size which is controlled through cell proliferation and post-mitotic cell expansion, respectively. To achieve a proper leaf size, cell proliferation and post-mitotic cell expansion should be co-ordinated during leaf morphogenesis. Compensation, which is enhanced post-mitotic cell expansion associated with a decrease in cell number during lateral organ development, is suggestive of such co-ordination. Genetic and kinematic studies revealed at least three classes of modes of compensation, indicating that compensation is a heterogeneous phenomenon. Recent studies have increased our understanding about the molecular basis of compensation by identifying the causal genes of each compensation-exhibiting mutant. Furthermore, analyses using chimeric leaves revealed that a type of compensated cell expansion requires cell-to-cell communication. Information from recent advances in molecular and genetic studies on compensation has been integrated here and its role in organ size regulation is discussed.
