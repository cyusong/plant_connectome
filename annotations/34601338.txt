Cold stress is one of the harsh environmental stresses that adversely affect plant growth and crop yields in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, plants have evolved mechanisms to overcome the impact of cold stress. Progress has been made in understanding how plants perceive and transduce low-temperature signals to tolerate cold stress. Small signaling molecules are crucial for cellular signal transduction by initiating the downstream signaling cascade that helps plants to respond to cold stress. These small signaling molecules include calcium, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, phosphatidic acid, and sphingolipids. The small signaling molecules are involved in many aspects of cellular and physiological functions, such as inducing gene expression and activating hormone signaling, resulting in upregulation of the antioxidant enzyme activities, osmoprotectant accumulation, malondialdehyde reduction, and photosynthesis improvement. We summarize our current understanding of the roles of the small signaling molecules in cold stress in plants, and highlight their crosstalk in cold signaling transduction. These discoveries help us understand how the plateau plants adapt to the severe alpine environment as well as to develop new crops tolerating cold stress in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
