Viruses are trailblazers in hijacking host systems for their own needs. Plant viruses have been shown to exploit alternative avenues of translocation within a host, including a challenging route through the xylem, to expand their niche and establish systemic spread, despite apparent host-imposed obstacles. Recent findings indicate that plant viruses from many families could successfully hack xylem cells in a broad range of plant hosts, including herbaceous and perennial woody plants. Similar to virus-related structures present in the phloem, virus particles and membrane-containing viral replication complexes are often observed in the xylem. Except for a few single-stranded DNA viruses in the family <i>Geminiviridae</i> and a negative-sense single-stranded RNA rhabdovirus, <i>Lettuce necrotic yellows virus</i>, the majority of the viruses that were detected in the xylem belong to the group of positive-sense RNA viruses. The diversity of the genome organization and virion morphology of those viruses indicates that xylem exploitation appears to be a widely adapted strategy for plant viruses. This review outlines the examples of the xylem-associated viruses and discusses factors that regulate virus inhabitation of the xylem as well as possible strategies of virus introduction into the xylem. In some cases, plant disease symptoms have been shown to be closely related to virus colonization of the xylem. Inhibiting viral xylem invasion could raise potential attractive approaches to manage virus diseases. Therefore, the identification of the host genes mediating virus interaction with the plant xylem tissue and understanding the underlying mechanisms call for more attention.
