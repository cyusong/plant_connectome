['27895227', "Potassium (K(+)) plays crucial roles in plant growth and development. In natural  environments, K(+) availability in soils is relatively low and fluctuating.  Transcriptional regulation of K(+) transporter genes is one of the most important  mechanisms in the plant's response to K(+) deficiency. In this study, we  demonstrated that the transcription factor ARF2 (Auxin Response Factor 2)  modulates the expression of the K(+) transporter gene HAK5 (High Affinity K(+)  transporter 5) in Arabidopsis thaliana The arf2 mutant plants showed a tolerant  phenotype similar to the HAK5-overexpressing lines on low-K(+) medium, whose  primary root lengths were longer than those of wild-type plants. High-affinity  K(+) uptake was significantly increased in these plants. ARF2-overexpressing  lines and the hak5 mutant were both sensitive to low-K(+) stress. Disruption of  HAK5 in the arf2 mutant abolished the low-K(+)-tolerant phenotype of arf2 As a  transcriptional repressor, ARF2 directly bound to the HAK5 promoter and repressed  HAK5 expression under K(+) sufficient conditions. ARF2 can be phosphorylated  after low-K(+) treatment, which abolished its DNA binding activity to the HAK5  promoter and relieved the inhibition on HAK5 transcription. Therefore, HAK5  transcript could be induced, and HAK5-mediated high-affinity K(+) uptake was  enhanced under K(+) deficient conditions. The presented results demonstrate that  ARF2 plays important roles in the response to external K(+) supply in Arabidopsis  and regulates HAK5 transcription accordingly.", '2016 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00684', 'ORCID:']
