As a major adverse environmental factor in most parts of the world, drought causes substantial crop yield losses. Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the staple foods for more than one-half of the world's population. Rice plants are sensitive to even mild drought stress and need almost twice the amount of water compared to wheat (Triticum aestivum) or maize (Zea mays). Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) small GTPase Nucleolar GTP-binding protein 1 (AtNOG1) plays a role in biotic stress tolerance. Here, we created transgenic rice lines constitutively overexpressing AtNOG1-1 or AtNOG1-2. We also developed rice RNA interference (RNAi) lines that show downregulation of OsNOG1. AtNOG1-1 and AtNOG1-2 overexpressors showed enhanced drought tolerance without compromising grain yield, whereas OsNOG1-RNAi was more susceptible to drought when compared to wild-type plants. Analysis of physiological parameters showed increased cell sap osmolality, relative water content, and abscisic acid (ABA) level, but decreased leaf water loss in AtNOG1-1 or AtNOG1-2 overexpressor lines compared to the control. We found upregulation of several genes involved in ABA and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling, stomata regulation, osmotic potential maintenance, stress protection, and disease resistance in AtNOG1-1 and AtNOG1-2 overexpressor lines compared to the control. We elucidated the role of NOG1-2 and NOG1-1 in regulation of silica body formation around stomata to prevent transpirational water loss. These results provide an avenue to confer drought tolerance in rice.
