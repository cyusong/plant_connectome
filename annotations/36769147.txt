Phenolic compounds and glucosinolates are secondary plant metabolites that play fundamental roles in plant resistance to abiotic stress. These compounds have been found to increase in stress situations related to plant adaptive capacity. This review assesses the functions of phenolic compounds and glucosinolates in plant interactions involving abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, high temperature, metals toxicity, and mineral deficiency or excess. Furthermore, their relation with water uptake and transport mediated through aquaporins is reviewed. In this way, the increases of phenolic compounds and glucosinolate synthesis have been related to primary responses to abiotic stress and induction of resistance. Thus, their metabolic pathways, root exudation, and external application are related to internal cell and tissue movement, with a lack of information in this latter aspect.
