Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) are plant cell wall proteins related to plant growth and development, and extensins (EXTs) are a subfamily of HRGPs. In this study, the function of HRGPs, especially EXTs, was investigated in the pollen tube and style cell growth of Nicotiana tabacum L. By using the techniques of protein blot and immunohistochemistry, the JIM20-recognized epitopes of EXTs were abundantly expressed in vivo for pollen tubes and transmitting tissue. A hydroxyproline synthesis inhibitor, 3,4-dehydro-l-proline (3,4-DHP), was used to investigate the functions of HRGPs. The addition of 3,4-DHP decreased the speed of pollen tube growth and shortened the length of style. Moreover, the hydroxyproline assay and JIM20 immunolocalization confirmed that 3,4-DHP treatment reduced the level of hydroxyproline and EXTs in the treated styles, respectively. These results indicate that HRGPs, most likely EXTs, may play important roles in the pollen tube and style cell growth.
