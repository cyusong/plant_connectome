The molecular responses of hydroponically cultivated tomato plants to As(V) or Cr(VI) were assessed by transcript accumulation analysis of genes coding for products potentially involved in heavy metal tolerance. A quantitative real-time PCR experiment was performed with Hsp90-1, MT2- and GR1-like protein genes using RNA isolated from tomato roots or shoots treated for 24h with As(V) or Cr(VI) at concentrations ranging from 80 to 640 microM. Both transient metallic treatments induced Hsp90-1 transcript accumulation in tomato plants. MT2- and GR1-like transcripts accumulated in tomato roots treated with As(V) but were only slightly affected by Cr(VI) treatment. Tomatoes showed phenotypic symptoms to heavy metal toxicity when plants were exposed to Cr(VI) but not As(V). Plant lethality was observed at 1280 microM Cr(VI), indicating that tomatoes were more tolerant to As than Cr stress under the experimental conditions used here.
