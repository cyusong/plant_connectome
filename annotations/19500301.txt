['19500301', 'Chloroplast biogenesis is a complex process in higher plants. Screening  chloroplast biogenesis mutants, and elucidating their molecular mechanisms, will  provide insight into the process of chloroplast biogenesis. In this paper, we  obtained an early chloroplast biogenesis mutant atecb2 that displayed albino  cotyledons and was seedling lethal. Microscopy observations revealed that the  chloroplast of atecb2 mutants lacked an organized thylakoid membrane. The AtECB2  gene, which is highly expressed in cotyledons and seedlings, encodes a  pentatricopeptide repeat protein (PPR) with a C-terminal DYW domain. The AtECB2  protein is localized in the chloroplast, and contains a conserved HxEx(n)CxxC  motif that is similar to the activated site of cytidine deaminase. The AtECB2  mutation affects the expression pattern of plastid-encoded genes. Immunoblot  analyses showed that the levels of photosynthetic proteins decreased  substantially in atecb2 mutants. Inspection of all reported plastid RNA editing  sites revealed that one editing site, accD, is not edited in atecb2 mutants.  Therefore, the AtECB2 protein must regulate the RNA editing of this site, and the  dysfunctional AccD protein from the unedited RNA molecules could lead to the  mutated phenotype. All of these results indicate that AtECB2 is required for  chloroplast transcript accD RNA editing and early chloroplast biogenesis in  Arabidopsis thaliana.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03930.x', 'Yang']
