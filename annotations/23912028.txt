Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit cuticle has been extensively studied due to its effect on the biochemical and physiological properties of the fruit. To date, several tomato mutants defective in proper cuticle formation have been identified. To gain insight into tomato cuticle formation, we investigated one such mutant, sticky peel/light green (pe lg). We verified the responsible gene by fine mapping and obtained the same conclusion as a previous report. To elucidate the pleiotropic effects of cuticle deficiency caused by the cd2 mutation, CD2 suppression lines were constructed. As found in the pe lg mutant, the suppression lines showed enhanced water permeability and aberrant leaf and fruit cuticles. Water use efficiency of the suppression line was lower than that of the wild type. However, photosynthetic ability was not affected in the suppression line. Since these phenotypes are related to altered deposition of wax and cutin, other lipidic metabolites might be changed, too. To confirm this hypothesis, we conducted metabolite profiling. The metabolite profiling revealed that not only lipid but also sugar, flavonoid and glycoalkaloid metabolites in fruit were changed in the cd2 mutant. These results indicate that CD2 is essential both for normal cutin and wax deposition and for proper accumulation of specific metabolites in tomato fruit.
