The regulation of cellular auxin levels is a critical factor in determining plant growth and architecture, as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) gradients along the plant axis and local IAA maxima are known to initiate numerous plant growth responses. The regulation of auxin homeostasis is mediated in part by transport, conjugation and deconjugation, as well as by de novo biosynthesis. However, the pathways of IAA biosynthesis are yet not entirely characterized at the molecular and biochemical level. It is suggested that several biosynthetic routes for the formation of IAA have evolved. One such pathway proceeds via the intermediate indole-3-acetamide (IAM), which is converted into IAA by the activity of specific IAM hydrolases, such as Arabidopsis AMIDASE1 (AMI1). In this article we present evidence to support the argument that AMI1-dependent IAA synthesis is likely not to be used during the first two days of seedling development.

IAA: !regulates! auxin homeostasis
transport/conjugation/deconjugation: !mediates! auxin homeostasis
IAM: !converted to! IAA
AMI1: !converts! IAM to IAA
AMI1: !likely not used! during first two days of seedling development
