['17304239', 'In plants, chloroplast division is an integral part of development, and these  vital organelles arise by binary fission from pre-existing cytosolic plastids.  Chloroplasts arose by endosymbiosis and although they have retained elements of  the bacterial cell division machinery to execute plastid division, they have  evolved to require two functionally distinct forms of the FtsZ protein and have  lost elements of the Min machinery required for Z-ring placement. Here, we  analyse the plastid division component accumulation and replication of  chloroplasts 3 (ARC3) and show that ARC3 forms part of the stromal plastid  division machinery. ARC3 interacts specifically with AtFtsZ1, acting as a Z-ring  accessory protein and defining a unique function for this family of FtsZ  proteins. ARC3 is involved in division site placement, suggesting that it might  functionally replace MinC, representing an important advance in our understanding  of the mechanism of chloroplast division and the evolution of the chloroplast  division machinery.', '2007 Mar', 'EMBO Rep', '10.1038/sj.embor.7400902', 'Moller']
