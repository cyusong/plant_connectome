<i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i> Bunge is a common Chinese herbal medicine, and its major active ingredients are phenolic acids and tanshinones, which are widely used to treat vascular diseases. However, the wild form of <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> possess low levels of these important pharmaceutical agents; thus, improving their levels is an active area of research. Transcription factors, which promote or inhibit the expressions of multiple genes involved in one or more biosynthetic pathways, are powerful tools for controlling gene expression in biosynthesis. Several families of transcription factors have been reported to participate in regulating phenolic acid and tanshinone biosynthesis and influence their accumulation. This review summarizes the current status in this field, with focus on the transcription factors which have been identified in recent years and their functions in the biosynthetic regulation of phenolic acids and tanshinones. Otherwise, the new insight for further research is provided. Finally, the application of the biosynthetic regulation of active ingredients by the transcription factors in <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> are discussed, and new insights for future research are explored.
