In animals, sorting of membrane proteins following their internalization from the plasma membrane (PM) by endocytosis occurs through a series of different endosomal compartments. In plants, how and where these sorting events take place is still poorly understood and our current view of the endocytic pathway still largely relies on analogies made from the animal system. However, extensive differences seem to exist between animal and plant endosomal functions, as exemplified by the role of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) as an early endosomal compartment in plants or the functional diversification of conserved sorting complexes. By using the Arabidopsis root tip as a reference model, we and other have begun to shed light on the complexity of the plant endocytic pathways. Notably, we have recently characterized the functions of an endosomal compartment, the SNX1-endosomes, also referred to as the prevacuolar compartment (PVC) or multivesicular bodies (MVB), in the sorting of different cargo proteins, including two related auxin-efflux carriers, PIN1 and PIN2. We have shown that routing decisions take place at this endosomal level, such as the sorting of PIN2 toward the lytic vacuole for degradation or PIN1 toward the PM for recycling.

Endocytosis: !sorts! Membrane Proteins 
TGN: !acts as! Early Endosomal Compartment (Plants) 
SNX1-endosomes: !sorts! PIN1/PIN2 
PIN2: !routed to! Lytic Vacuole (Degradation) 
PIN1: !routed to! Plasma Membrane (Recycling)
