During secondary growth, meristematic cells in the cambium can either proliferate to maintain the stem cell population or differentiate into xylem or phloem. The balance between these two developmental trajectories is tightly regulated by many environmental and endogenous cues. Strigolactones (SLs), a class of plant hormones, were previously reported to regulate secondary growth by promoting cambium activity. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of SL action in plant secondary growth are not well understood. We performed histological, genetic, and biochemical analyses using genetic materials in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) with altered activity of the transcription factors BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1) or WUSCHEL-related HOMEOBOX4 (WOX4) or lacking MORE AXILLARY SHOOT2 (MAX2), a key positive component in the SL signaling pathway. We found that BES1, a downstream regulator in the SL signaling pathway that promotes shoot branching and xylem differentiation, also inhibits WOX4 expression, a key regulator of cambium cell division in the intercellular TRACHEARY ELEMENT DIFFERENTIATION INHIBITORY FACTOR (TDIF)-TDIF RECEPTOR (TDR) signaling pathway. The antagonistic roles of BES1 and WOX4 in the regulation of cambium activity may integrate intercellular TDIF signals to efficiently and bidirectionally modulate cambium cell proliferation and differentiation. As both BES1 and WOX4 are widely involved in various endogenous signals and responses to environmental stimuli, these findings may provide insight into the dynamic regulation of cambium development.
