Aquaporin (AQP) is a water channel protein found in various subcellular membranes of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The physiological functions of AQPs have been elucidated in many organisms. However, understanding their biogenesis remains elusive, particularly regarding how they assemble into tetramers. Here, we investigated the amino acid residues involved in the tetramer formation of the Arabidopsis plasma membrane AQP AtPIP2;1 using extensive amino acid substitution mutagenesis. The mutant proteins V41A/E44A, F51A/L52A, F87A/I91A, F92A/I93A, V95A/Y96A, and H216A/L217A, harboring alanine substitutions in the transmembrane (TM) helices of AtPIP2;1 polymerized into multiple oligomeric complexes with a variable number of subunits greater than four. Moreover, these mutant proteins failed to traffic to the plasma membrane, instead of accumulating in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Structure-based modeling revealed that these residues are largely involved in interactions between TM helices within monomers. These results suggest that inter-TM interactions occurring both within and between monomers play crucial roles in tetramer formation in the AtPIP2;1 complex. Moreover, the assembly of AtPIP2;1 tetramers is critical for their trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane, as well as water permeability.
