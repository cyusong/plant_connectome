Cytokinin is a plant hormone essential for growth and development. The elucidation of its signalling pathway as a variant of the bacterial two-component signalling system (TCS) has led to a better understanding of how this hormone is involved in general plant processes. A set of cytokinin-regulated transcription factors known as cytokinin response factors (CRFs) have been described as a potential branch emanating from the TCS, yet little is known about how CRFs actually interact with each other and with members of the TCS pathway. Here the interactions of CRF proteins (CRF1-CRF8) using the yeast two-hybrid system and bimolecular fluorescence complementation in planta assays are described. It was found that CRFs are readily able to form both homo- and heterodimers with each other. The first analysis of CRF versus TCS pathway protein interactions is also provided, which indicates that CRFs (CRF1-CRF8) are able specifically to interact directly with most of the Arabidopsis histidine-phosphotransfer proteins (AHP1-AHP5) further solidifying their link to the cytokinin signalling pathway. In addition, the region of CRF proteins involved in these interactions was mapped and it was determined that the clade-specific CRF domain alone is sufficient for these interactions. This is the first described function for the CRF domain in plants.
