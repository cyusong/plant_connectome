Peanut/maize intercropping is a sustainable and effective agroecosystem that evidently enhances the Fe nutrition of peanuts in calcareous soils. So far, the mechanism involved in this process has not been elucidated. In this study, we unravel the effects of phytosiderophores in improving Fe nutrition of intercropped peanuts in peanut/maize intercropping. The maize ys3 mutant, which cannot release phytosiderophores, did not improve Fe nutrition of peanut, whereas the maize ys1 mutant, which can release phytosiderophores, prevented Fe deficiency, indicating an important role of phytosiderophores in improving the Fe nutrition of intercropped peanut. Hydroponic experiments were performed to simplify the intercropping system, which revealed that phytosiderophores released by Fe-deficient wheat promoted Fe acquisition in nearby peanuts and thus improved their Fe nutrition. Moreover, the phytosiderophore deoxymugineic acid (DMA) was detected in the roots of intercropped peanuts. The yellow stripe1-like (YSL) family of genes, which are homologous to maize yellow stripe 1 (ZmYS1), were identified in peanut roots. Further characterization indicated that among five AhYSL genes, AhYSL1, which was localized in the epidermis of peanut roots, transported Fe(III)-DMA. These results imply that in alkaline soil, Fe(III)-DMA dissolved by maize might be absorbed directly by neighbouring peanuts in the peanut/maize intercropping system.
