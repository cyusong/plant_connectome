Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts longer than 200 nt that are distributed widely in organisms and play many physiological roles. The BoNR8 lncRNA is a 272 nt long transcript yielded by RNA polymerase III in cabbage that was identified as the closest homolog of the AtR8 lncRNA in Arabidopsis. The BoNR8 lncRNA was expressed extensively in the epidermal tissue in the root elongation zone of germinated seeds, and its accumulation was induced by abiotic stresses, auxins and ABA. To investigate the correlation between the BoNR8 lncRNA and germination, BoNR8-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants (BoNR8-AtOX) were prepared. Three independent BoNR8-AtOX lines showed less primary root elongation, incomplete silique development and decreased germination rates. The germination efficiencies were affected strongly by ABA and slightly by salt stress, and ABA-related gene expression was changed in the BoNR8-AtOX lines.
