Special red cells were found on the adaxial surface of tertiary pulvini of Mimosa pudica and experiments performed to determine the origin and function of these cells. Using anatomical (light, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy) and electrophysiological techniques, we have demonstrated that these red cells are real mechanoreceptor cells. They can generate receptor potential following mechanical stimuli and they are in connection with excitable motor cells (through plasmodesmata). We also provide evidence that these red cells are derived from stomatal subsidiary cells and not guard cells. As histochemical studies show red cells contain tannin, which is important in development of action potentials and movements of plants. These cells could be one of unidentified mechanoreceptors of mimosa.
