Light, hormones and their interaction regulate different aspects of development in non-flowering plants. They might have played a role in the evolution of different plant groups by conferring specific adaptive evolutionary changes. Plants are sessile organisms. Unlike animals, they lack the opportunity to abandon their habitat in unfavorable conditions. They respond to different environmental cues and adapt accordingly to control their growth and developmental pattern. While phytohormones are known to be internal regulators of plant development, light is a major environmental signal that shapes plant processes. It is plausible that light-hormone crosstalk might have played an important role in plant evolution. But how the crosstalk between light and phytohormone signaling pathways might have shaped the plant evolution is unclear. One of the possible reasons is that flowering plants have been studied extensively in context of plant development, which cannot serve the purpose of evolutionary comparisons. In order to elucidate the role of light, hormone and their crosstalk in the evolutionary adaptation in plant kingdom, one needs to understand various light- and hormone-mediated processes in diverse non-flowering plants. This review is an attempt to outline major light- and phytohormone-mediated responses in non-flowering plant groups such as algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes and gymnosperms.
