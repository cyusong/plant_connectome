['29233855', 'Light utilization is finely tuned in photosynthetic organisms to prevent cellular  damage. The dissipation of excess absorbed light energy, a process termed  nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), plays an important role in photoprotection.  Little is known about the sustained or slowly reversible form(s) of NPQ and  whether they are photoprotective, in part due to the lack of mutants. The  Arabidopsis thaliana suppressor of quenching1 (soq1) mutant exhibits enhanced  sustained NPQ, which we term qH. To identify molecular players involved in qH, we  screened for suppressors of soq1 and isolated mutants affecting either  chlorophyllide a oxygenase or the chloroplastic lipocalin, now renamed plastid  lipocalin (LCNP). Analysis of the mutants confirmed that qH is localized to the  peripheral antenna (LHCII) of photosystem II and demonstrated that LCNP is  required for qH, either directly (by forming NPQ sites) or indirectly (by  modifying the LHCII membrane environment). qH operates under stress conditions  such as cold and high light and is photoprotective, as it reduces lipid  peroxidation levels. We propose that, under stress conditions, LCNP protects the  thylakoid membrane by enabling sustained NPQ in LHCII, thereby preventing singlet  oxygen stress.', '2018 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00536', 'ORCID:']
