Heat stress changes isoform content and distribution of cytoskeletal subunits in pollen tubes affecting accumulation of secretory vesicles and distribution of sucrose synthase, an enzyme involved in cell wall synthesis. Plants are sessile organisms and are therefore exposed to damages caused by the predictable increase in temperature. We have analyzed the effects of temperatures on the development of pollen tubes by focusing on the cytoskeleton and related processes, such as vesicular transport and cell wall synthesis. First, we show that heat stress affects pollen germination and, to a lesser extent, pollen tube growth. Both, microtubules and actin filaments, are damaged by heat treatment and changes of actin and tubulin isoforms were observed in both cases. Damages to actin filaments mainly concern the actin array present in the subapex, a region critical for determining organelle and vesicle content in the pollen tube apex. In support of this, green fluorescent protein-labeled vesicles are arranged differently between heat-stressed and control samples. In addition, newly secreted cell wall material (labeled by propidium iodide) shows an altered distribution. Damage induced by heat stress also extends to proteins that bind actin and participate in cell wall synthesis, such as sucrose synthase. Ultimately, heat stress affects the cytoskeleton thereby causing alterations in the process of vesicular transport and cell wall deposition.
