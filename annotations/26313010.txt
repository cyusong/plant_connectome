['26313010', "Glucosylceramides (GlcCer), glucose-conjugated sphingolipids, are major  components of the endomembrane system and plasma membrane in most eukaryotic  cells. Yet the quantitative significance and cellular functions of GlcCer are not  well characterized in plants and other multi-organ eukaryotes. To address this,  we examined Arabidopsis lines that were lacking or deficient in GlcCer by  insertional disruption or by RNA interference (RNAi) suppression of the single  gene for GlcCer synthase (GCS, At2g19880), the enzyme that catalyzes GlcCer  synthesis. Null mutants for GCS (designated 'gcs-1') were viable as seedlings,  albeit strongly reduced in size, and failed to develop beyond the seedling stage.  Heterozygous plants harboring the insertion allele exhibited reduced transmission  through the male gametophyte. Undifferentiated calli generated from gcs-1  seedlings and lacking GlcCer proliferated in a manner similar to calli from  wild-type plants. However, gcs-1 calli, in contrast to wild-type calli, were  unable to develop organs on differentiation media. Consistent with a role for  GlcCer in organ-specific cell differentiation, calli from gcs-1 mutants formed  roots and leaves on media supplemented with the glucosylated sphingosine  glucopsychosine, which was readily converted to GlcCer independent of GCS.  Underlying these phenotypes, gcs-1 cells had altered Golgi morphology and fewer  cisternae per Golgi apparatus relative to wild-type cells, indicative of protein  trafficking defects. Despite seedling lethality in the null mutant, GCS RNAi  suppression lines with </=2% of wild-type GlcCer levels were viable and fertile.  Collectively, these results indicate that GlcCer are essential for cell-type  differentiation and organogenesis, and plant cells produce amounts of GlcCer in  excess of that required for normal development.", '2015 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13000', 'Cahoon']
