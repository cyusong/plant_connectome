Proper stamen filament elongation is essential for plant self-pollination and reproduction. Several phytohormones such as jasmonate and gibberellin play important roles in controlling filament elongation, but other endogenous signals involved in this developmental process remain unknown. We report here that three EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE (EPFL) family peptides, EPFL4, EPFL5 and EPFL6, act redundantly to promote stamen filament elongation via enhancing filament cell proliferation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Knockout of EPFL4-6 genes led to shortened filaments due to defective filament cell proliferation, resulting in pollination failure and male sterility. Further genetic and biochemical analyses indicated that the ERECTA family and the SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK) family RLKs form receptor complexes to perceive EPFL4-6 peptides and promote filament cell proliferation. Moreover, based on both loss- and gain-of-function genetic analyses, the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK4/MKK5-MPK6 was shown to function downstream of EPFL4-6 to positively regulate cell proliferation in stamen filaments. Together, this study reveals that an EPFL peptide signaling pathway composed of the EPFL4-6 peptide ligands, the ERECTA-SERK receptor complexes and the downstream MKK4/MKK5-MPK6 cascade promotes stamen filament elongation via enhancing filament cell proliferation to ensure successful self-pollination and normal fertility in Arabidopsis.
