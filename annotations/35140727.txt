Plants acquire nitrogen, an essential macronutrient, from the soil as nitrate. Since nitrogen availability is a major determinant of crop productivity, the soil is amended with nitrogenous fertilizers. Extensive use of irrigation can lead to the accumulation of salt in the soil, which compromises crop productivity. Our characterization of <i>NODULE INCEPTION (NIN)-like PROTEIN 7</i> (<i>NLP7</i>), a transcription factor regulating the primary response to nitrate, revealed an intersection of salt stress and nitrate metabolism. The growth of loss-of-function mutant <i>nlp7</i> was tolerant to high salinity that normally reduces the fresh weight and chlorophyll and protein content of wild type (Col-0). On a medium with high salinity, the <i>nlp7</i> experienced less stress, accumulating less proline, producing less nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and expressing lower transcript levels of marker genes, such as <i>RD29A</i> and <i>COR47</i>, than Col-0. Nevertheless, more sodium ions were translocated to and accumulated in the shoots of <i>nlp7</i> than that of Col-0. Since <i>nlp7</i> also expressed less nitrate reductase (NR) activity, nitrate accumulated to abnormally high levels with or without salinity. We attributed the enhanced salt tolerance of <i>nlp7</i> to the balanced accumulation of nitrate anions and sodium cations. Our results suggest that nitrate metabolism and signaling might be targeted to improve salt tolerance.
