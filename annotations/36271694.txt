Ethylene (ET) signaling plays a critical role in the ripening of climacteric fruits such as tomato. Brassinosteroids (BRs) were found to promote the ripening of both climacteric and non-climacteric fruits. However, the mechanism of interaction between ET and BRs during fruit ripening is unclear. Here, we found that BR synthesis and signaling increased after the onset of fruit ripening. Overexpression of the BR synthesis gene DWARF (DWF) promotedfruit softening, lycopene synthesis and ET production, whereas defect of DWF inhibited them. BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) as a key component of BR signaling, enhanced fruit lycopene content by directly activating the transcription of PSY1 gene. Interestingly, the increases in BR synthesis and BZR1 protein levels were dependent on ET signaling. Knocking out the ET-induced APETALA2a (AP2a) suppressed the expression of DWF and BR accumulation. Molecular assays demonstrated that AP2a was a positive regulator of DWF expression. Furthermore, 28-homobrassinolide, a bioactive BR, partially compensated the defects of lycopene accumulation and expression of PSY1 in ap2a mutant fruits. The results demonstrated that AP2a mediated ET signaling to regulate BR synthesis and signaling. BRs played critical roles in lycopene synthesis after onset of fruit ripening.
