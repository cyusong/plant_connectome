The present study aimed to scrutinize the effect of different cow dung bacterial treatments on the nutritional value of <i>Capsicum annuum</i> L. Among all treatments, seeds inoculated with <i>Bacillus megaterium</i> (CDK25) showed significant enhancement in various proximate constituents <i>viz</i>., crude fiber (3.31%), crude protein (3.84%), and ash (2.53%) as compared to control. Likewise, significant increase in different nutrient contents <i>viz</i>., Ca (16.26 mg/100 g), Mg (17.37 mg/100 g), P (11.91 mg/100 g), K (0.47 mg/100 g), Fe (1.37 mg/100 g), and Zn (0.21 mg/100 g) was recorded over the control. Principal component analysis data depicts a positive correlation between different treatments with variables, validating enhancement in nutritional constituents by <i>B. megaterium</i> (CDK25) treatment. The study suggests the application of "<i>B. megaterium</i>" for achieving the persistent potential for augmenting and boosting up plant biological, functional, and nutritional assets, thereby enhancing the overall edible quality of <i>C. annuum</i> L. along with weathering of soil minerals.
