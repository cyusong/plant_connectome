The spatial organisation of the splicing system in plant cells containing either reticular (Allium cepa) or chromocentric (Lupinus luteus) nuclei was studied by immunolabelling of SR proteins, snRNA, and the PANA antigen, known markers for interchromatin granule clusters in mammalian cells. Electron microscope results allowed us to determine the distribution of these molecules within the structural domains of the nucleus. Similar to animal cells, in both plant species SR proteins were localised in interchromatin granules, but contrary to animal cells contained very small amounts of snRNA. The area with the strongest snRNA and SR protein co-localisation was the perichromatin region, which may be the location of pre-mRNA splicing in the plant cell nuclei. The only observable differences in the organisation of reticular and chromocentric nuclei were the size of the speckles and the number of snRNA pools in the condensed chromatin. We conclude that, despite remarkable changes in the nuclear architecture, the organisation of the splicing system is remarkably similar in both types of plant cell nuclei.
