Grain size is a key trait associated with bread wheat yield. It is also the most frequently selected trait during domestication. After the phenotypic characterization of 768 bread wheat accessions in three plots for at least two years, the present study shows that the improved variety showed significantly higher grain size but lower grain protein content than the landrace. Using 55K SNP assay genotyping and large-scale phenotyping population and GWAS data, we identified 5, 6, 6, and 6 QTLs associated with grain length, grain weight, grain area, and thousand grain weight, respectively. Seven of the 23 QTLs showed common association within different locations or years. Most significantly, the key locus associated with grain length, <i>qGL-2D</i>, showed the highest association after years of multi-plot testing. Haplotype and evolution analysis indicated that the superior allele of <i>qGL-2D</i> was mainly hidden in the improved variety rather than in landrace, which may contribute to the significant difference in grain length. A comprehensive analysis of transcriptome and homolog showed that <i>TraesCS2D02G414800</i> could be the most likely candidate gene for <i>qGL-2D</i>. Overall, this study presents several reliable grain size QTLs and candidate gene for grain length associated with bread wheat yield.
