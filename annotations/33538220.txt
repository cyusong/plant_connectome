Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of plant hormones that control plant architecture. SL levels in roots are determined by the nutrient conditions in the rhizosphere, especially the levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Our previous research showed that SL production is induced in response to deficiency of sulfur (S) as well as of N and P, and inhibits shoot branching, accelerates leaf senescence, and regulates lamina joint angle in rice. Here we show biomass, total S contents, and SL levels in rice under S-sufficient and S-deficient conditions using a split-root system. When one part of the root system was cultured in S-sufficient medium and the other in S-deficient medium (+S/-S), shoot fresh weight was unaffected relative to the +S/+S condition. The shoot weight significantly decreased in -S/-S condition. In contrast, there was no significant difference in root fresh weight between +S and -S conditions. In +S/-S condition, SL levels were systemically reduced in both parts, the shoot S content increased, but the root S content in S-deficient medium was unaffected relative to the -S/-S condition. These results suggest that shoots, not roots, recognize S deficiency, which induces SL production in roots.
