Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis; EAB) is an Asian insect species that has been invasive to North America for 20 years. During this time, the emerald ash borer has killed tens of millions of American ash (Fraxinus spp) trees. Understanding the inherent defenses of susceptible American ash trees will provide information to breed new resistant varieties of ash trees. We have performed RNA-seq on naturally infested green ash (F. pennsylvanica) trees at low, medium and high levels of increasing EAB infestation and proteomics on low and high levels of EAB infestation. Most significant transcript changes we detected occurred between the comparison of medium and high levels of EAB infestation, indicating that the tree is not responding to EAB until it is highly infested. Our integrative analysis of the RNA-Seq and proteomics data identified 14 proteins and 4 transcripts that contribute most to the difference between highly infested and low infested trees. The putative functions of these transcripts and proteins suggests roles of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and oxidation, chitinase activity, pectinesterase activity, strigolactone signaling, and protein turnover.
