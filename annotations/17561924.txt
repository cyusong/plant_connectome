Publicly available microarray experiments were used to analyze Arabidopsis thaliana genes whose expression is correlated with that of nuclear genes encoding components of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery (OxPhos genes). This analysis indicated the existence of coordination in the expression of genes encoding components of the five respiratory complexes. For these genes, preferential expression was observed in anthers and roots, especially in the elongation zone, while reduced or very low relative expression was evident in leaves and mature pollen grains. A global induction of OxPhos genes by carbohydrates, photo-destruction of chloroplasts, inhibition of cellulose synthesis, release from dormancy and germination, among other conditions, was also observed. Cluster analysis of the response of Arabidopsis genes to a set of 15 treatments allowed the identification of DNA motifs, known as site II, that are frequently present in the upstream regions of genes with responses like those of OxPhos genes. Mutagenic analysis of site II motifs in several genes encoding respiratory chain components showed that they actively participate in transcription of these genes. We conclude that an important number of nuclear genes encoding components of the five respiratory complexes show coordinated expression under various circumstances, and that site II elements and the putative proteins that interact with them are, together with as yet unidentified factors, important actors in this coordinated response.
