Genetic studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have shown that two members of the beta-amylase (BAM) family BAM3 and BAM4 are required for leaf starch breakdown at night. Both are plastid proteins and while BAM3 encodes an active BAM, BAM4 is not an active alpha-1,4-glucan hydrolase. To gain further insight into the possible function of BAM4 we constructed reporter genes using promoters for both BAM3 and BAM4 genes, driving beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and luciferase (LUC) expression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Both promoters directed expression in vascular tissue throughout the plant including cotyledons, leaves, petioles, stems, petals, siliques and roots. Tissue sections showed expression to be focused in phloem cells in stem and petiole. The BAM3 promoter was also expressed strongly throughout the photosynthetic tissues of leaves, sepals and siliques, whereas the BAM4 promoter was not. Conversely, the BAM4 promoter was active in root tip but the BAM3 promoter was not. To confirm these expression patterns and to compare with expression of other starch genes we carried-out RT-PCR analysis on RNA from vascular (replum) and non-vascular (valve) tissues of siliques. This confirmed that BAM4 expression together with RAM1 (BAM5) and GWD2 genes is stronger in the replum than the valve, whereas BAM3 is strong in both tissues. These results show that even though BAM3 and BAM4 genes apparently interact genetically in leaf starch metabolism, BAM4 is preferentially expressed in non-photosynthetic vascular tissue, so revealing a potentially greater level of complexity in the control of starch breakdown than had previously been recognised.
