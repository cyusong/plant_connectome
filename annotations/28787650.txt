In a marine green starch-producing microalga Tetraselmis subcordiformis, the role of starch phosphorylase (SP) in the starch biosynthesis was disclosed by characterizing the enzyme properties and activity variations during the starch accumulation process. TsSP4, a SP isoform accounting for the major SP activity in T. subcordiformis, was unique to be active in a monomer form with a molecular weight of approximately 110kDa. It resembled one of the chloroplast-located SPs (PhoA) in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with a similarity of 63.3% in sequence, though it possessed the typical L78/80 domain found in the plastidial SPs (Pho1) of higher plants that was absent in PhoA. TsSP4 exhibited moderate sensitivity to ADP-Glc inhibition and had a high activity for longer-chain linear maltooligosacchride (MOS) and amylopectin against highly branched glycogen as the substrates. TsSP4 had 2-fold higher affinity for Glc-1-P in the synthetic direction than for Pi in the phosphorolytic direction, and the catalytic constant k<sub>cat</sub> for Glc-1-P was 2-fold of that for Pi. Collectively, TsSP4 preferred synthetic rather than phosphorolytic direction. TsSP4 could elongate MOSs even initially with Pi alone in the absence of Glc-1-P, which further supported its synthetic role in the starch biosynthesis. TsSP4 displayed increased activities in the developing and mature stage of starch biosynthesis under nitrogen-starvation conditions, indicating its possible contribution to the amylopectin amplification.
