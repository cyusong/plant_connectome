Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein (Cas)-mediated gene disruption has revolutionized biomedical research as well as plant and animal breeding. However, most disease-causing mutations and agronomically important genetic variations are single base polymorphisms (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) that require precision genome editing tools for correction of the sequences. Although homology-directed repair of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) can introduce precise changes, such repairs are inefficient in differentiated animal and plant cells. Base editing and prime editing are two recently developed genome engineering approaches that can efficiently introduce precise edits into target sites without requirement of DSB formation or donor DNA templates. They have been applied in several plant species with promising results. Here, we review the extensive literature on improving the efficiency, target scope, and specificity of base editors and prime editors in plants. We also highlight recent progress on base editing in plant organellar genomes and discuss how these precision genome editing tools are advancing basic plant research and crop breeding.
