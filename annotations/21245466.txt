['21245466', 'Plant viruses are excellent tools for studying microbial-plant interactions as  well as the complexities of host activities. Our study focuses on the role of C2  encoded by Beet severe curly top virus (BSCTV) in the virus-plant interaction.  Using BSCTV C2 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, a C2-interacting protein,  S-adenosyl-methionine decarboxylase 1 (SAMDC1), was identified from an  Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library. The interaction was confirmed by an in vitro  pull-down assay and a firefly luciferase complemention imaging assay in planta.  Biochemical analysis further showed that the degradation of the SAMDC1 protein  was inhibited by MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, and that C2 could attenuate  the degradation of the SAMDC1 protein. Genetic analysis showed that loss of  function of SAMDC1 resulted in reduced susceptibility to BSCTV infection and  reduced viral DNA accumulation, similar to the effect of BSCTV C2 deficiency.  Bisulfite sequencing analysis further showed that C2 deficiency caused enhanced  DNA methylation of the viral genome in infected plants. We also showed that C2  can suppress de novo methylation in the FWA transgenic assay in the C2 transgene  background. Overexpression of SAMDC1 can mimic the suppressive activity of C2  against green fluorescent protein-directed silencing. These results suggest that  C2 interferes with the host defense mechanism of DNA methylation-mediated gene  silencing by attenuating the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of SAMDC1.', '2011 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.081695', 'Xie']
