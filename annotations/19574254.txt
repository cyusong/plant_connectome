Expression of the Arabidopsis Oxidative Signal-Inducible1 (OXI1) serine/threonine protein kinase gene (At3g25250) is induced by oxidative stress. The kinase is required for root hair development and basal defence against the oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica, two separate H(2)O(2)-mediated processes. In this study, the role of OXI1 during pathogenesis was characterized further. Null oxi1 mutants are more susceptible to both virulent and avirulent strains of the biotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae compared with the wild type, indicating that OXI1 positively regulates both basal resistance triggered by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, as well as effector-triggered immunity. The level of OXI1 expression appears to be critical in mounting an appropriate defence response since OXI1 overexpressor lines also display increased susceptibility to biotrophic pathogens. The induction of OXI1 after P. syringae infection spatially and temporally correlates with the oxidative burst. Furthermore, induction is reduced in atrbohD mutants and after application of DPI (an inhibitor of NADPH oxidases) suggesting that reactive oxygen species produced through NADPH oxidases drives OXI1 expression during this plant-pathogen interaction.
