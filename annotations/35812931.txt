Gentians cultivated in Japan (<i>Gentiana triflora</i> and <i>Gentiana scabra</i> and hybrids) have blue flowers, but flower colour intensity differs among cultivars. The molecular mechanism underlying the variation in flower colour intensity is unclear. Here, we produced F<sub>2</sub> progeny derived from an F<sub>1</sub> cross of intense- and faint-blue lines and attempted to identify the genes responsible for flower colour intensity using RNA-sequencing analyses. Comparative analysis of flower colour intensity and transcriptome data revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs), although known flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes showed similar expression patterns. From quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, we identified two and four genes with significantly different expression levels in the intense- and faint-blue flower lines, respectively. We conducted further analyses on one of the DEGs, termed <i>GtMIF1</i>, which encodes a putative mini zinc-finger protein homolog, which was most differently expressed in faint-blue individuals. Functional analysis of <i>GtMIF1</i> was performed by producing stable tobacco transformants. <i>GtMIF1</i>-overexpressing tobacco plants showed reduced flower colour intensity compared with untransformed control plants. DNA-marker analysis also confirmed that the <i>GtMIF1</i> allele of the faint-blue flower line correlated well with faint flower colour in F<sub>2</sub> progeny. These results suggest that <i>GtMIF1</i> is one of the key genes involved in determining the flower colour intensity of gentian.
