['19618250', 'Plants have evolved intricate mechanisms to respond and adapt to a wide variety  of biotic and abiotic stresses in their environment. The Arabidopsis DEAR1 (DREB  and EAR motif protein 1; At3g50260) gene encodes a protein containing significant  homology to the DREB1/CBF (dehydration-responsive element binding protein  1/C-repeat binding factor) domain and the EAR (ethylene response  factor-associated amphiphilic repression) motif. We show here that DEAR1 mRNA  accumulates in response to both pathogen infection and cold treatment. Transgenic  Arabidopsis overexpressing DEAR1 (DEAR1ox) showed a dwarf phenotype and  lesion-like cell death, together with constitutive expression of PR genes and  accumulation of salicylic acid. DEAR1ox also showed more limited P. syringae  pathogen growth compared to wild-type, consistent with an activated defense  phenotype. In addition, transient expression experiments revealed that the DEAR1  protein represses DRE/CRT (dehydration-responsive element/C-repeat)-dependent  transcription, which is regulated by low temperature. Furthermore, the induction  of DREB1/CBF family genes by cold treatment was suppressed in DEAR1ox, leading to  a reduction in freezing tolerance. These results suggest that DEAR1 has an  upstream regulatory role in mediating crosstalk between signaling pathways for  biotic and abiotic stress responses.', '2009 Nov', 'J Plant Res', '10.1007/s10265-009-0252-6', 'Yamaguchi']
