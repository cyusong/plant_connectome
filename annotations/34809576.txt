Pineapple (Ananas comosus L. Merr.) is the third most important tropical fruit in China. In other crops, farmers can easily judge the nutritional requirements from leaf color. However, concerning pineapple, it is difficult due to the variation in leaf color of the cultivated pineapple varieties. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of nutrient transport, accumulation, and assimilation was targeted in this study. We explored the D-leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) contents, transcriptome, and metabolome of seven pineapple varieties. Significantly higher N, P, and K% contents were observed in Bali, Caine, and Golden pineapple. The transcriptome sequencing of 21 libraries resulted in the identification of 14,310 differentially expressed genes in the D-leaves of seven pineapple varieties. Genes associated with N transport and assimilation in D-leaves of pineapple was possibly regulated by nitrate and ammonium transporters, and glutamate dehydrogenases play roles in N assimilation in arginine biosynthesis pathways. Photosynthesis and photosynthesis-antenna proteins pathways were also significantly regulated between the studied genotypes. Phosphate transporters and mitochondrial phosphate transporters were differentially regulated regarding inorganic P transport. WRKY, MYB, and bHLH transcription factors were possibly regulating the phosphate transporters. The observed varying contents of K% in the D-leaves was associated to the regulation of K<sup>+</sup> transporters and channels under the influence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. The UPLC-MS/MS analysis detected 873 metabolites which were mainly classified as flavonoids, lipids, and phenolic acids. These findings provide a detailed insight into the N, P, K% contents in pineapple D-leaf and their transcriptomic and metabolomic signatures.
