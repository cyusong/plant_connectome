['17635220', 'Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPT) occurs in both eukaryotic  and prokaryotic organisms. However, the molecular and functional properties of  plant HGPT are not well understood. In this study, it was found that the putative  HGPT proteins from dicot and monocot plant species exhibited significant  identities to their homologs from other cellular organisms. Ectopic expression of  the HGPTs from Arabidopsis, soybean or wheat complemented HGPT deficiency in the  hpt1 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recombinant Arabidopsis HGPT (AtHGPT)  catalyzed both forward and reverse reactions in in vitro biochemical assays. The  relative catalytic efficiency for the synthesis of guanosine monophosphate (GMP)  was significantly greater than that for the production of guanine from GMP.  Further investigations led to identification of the candidate residues that may  form the pyrophosphate (PPi) binding loop in AtHGPT. AtHGPT expression level was  dynamically regulated in Arabidopsis organs and during leaf development and  senescence and seed germination. AtHGPT knockout mutant germinated more slowly  than wild type control, whereas its overexpression mutant exhibited accelerated  germination. Collectively, the data suggest that functional HGPTs are expressed  in higher plants. In Arabidopsis, HGPT plays an active role in the salvage of  purine bases and its activity is required for efficient seed germination.', '2007', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02117.x', 'Wang']
