Lipid-derived jasmonates (JAs) play a crucial role in a variety of plant development and defense mechanisms. In recent years, significant progress has been made toward understanding the JA signaling pathway. In this review, we discuss JA biosynthesis, as well as its core signaling pathway, termination mechanisms, and the evolutionary origin of JA signaling. JA regulates not only plant regeneration, reproductive growth, and vegetative growth but also the responses of plants to stresses, including pathogen as well as virus infection, herbivore attack, and abiotic stresses. We also focus on the JA signaling pathway, considering its crosstalk with the gibberellin (GA), auxin, and phytochrome signaling pathways for mediation of the trade-offs between growth and defense. In summary, JA signals regulate multiple outputs of plant defense and growth and act to balance growth and defense in order to adapt to complex environments.
