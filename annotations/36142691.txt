Early flowering trait is essential for rice cultivars grown at high latitude since delayed flowering leads to seed development at low temperature, which decreases yield. However, early flowering at high temperature promotes the formation of chalky seeds with low apparent amylose content and high starch gelatinization temperature, thus affecting grain quality. Deletion of starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) shows inverse effects of high temperature, and the ss2a mutant shows higher apparent amylose content and lower gelatinization temperature. Heading date 1 (Hd1) is the major regulator of flowering time, and a nonfunctional hd1 allele is required for early flowering. To understand the relationship among heading date, starch properties, and yield, we generated and characterized near-isogenic rice lines with ss2a Hd1, ss2a Hd1 hd1, and ss2a hd1 genotypes. The ss2a Hd1 line showed the highest plant biomass; however, its grain yield varied by year. The ss2a Hd1 hd1 showed higher total grain weight than ss2a hd1. The ss2a hd1 line produced the lowest number of premature seeds and showed higher gelatinization temperature and lower apparent amylose content than ss2a Hd1. These results highlight Hd1 as the candidate gene for developing high-yielding rice cultivars with the desired starch structure.
