In the establishment of plant-rhizobial symbiosis, the plant hosts express nodulin proteins during root nodule organogenesis. A limited number of nodulins have been characterized, and these perform essential functions in root nodule development and metabolism. Most nodulins are expressed in the nodule and at lower levels in other plant tissues. Previously, we isolated <i>Nodulin 22</i> (<i>PvNod22</i>) from a common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.) cDNA library derived from <i>Rhizobium</i>-infected roots. <i>Pv</i>Nod22 is a noncanonical, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized, small heat shock protein that confers protection against oxidative stress when overexpressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Virus-induced gene silencing of <i>PvNod22</i> resulted in necrotic lesions in the aerial organs of <i>P. vulgaris</i> plants cultivated under optimal conditions, activation of the ER-unfolded protein response (UPR), and, finally, plant death. Here, we examined the expression of <i>PvNod22</i> in common bean plants during the establishment of rhizobial endosymbiosis and its relationship with two cellular processes associated with plant immunity, the UPR and autophagy. In the RNA interference lines, numerous infection threads stopped their progression before reaching the cortex cell layer of the root, and nodules contained fewer nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Collectively, our results suggest that <i>Pv</i>Nod22 has a nonredundant function during legume-rhizobia symbiosis associated with infection thread elongation, likely by sustaining protein homeostasis in the ER.
