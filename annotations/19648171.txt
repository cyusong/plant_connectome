The single-celled trichome of Arabidopsis thaliana is a widely used model system for studying cell development. While the pathways that control the later stages of trichome development are well characterized, the early signalling events that co-ordinate these pathways are less well understood. Hormones such as gibberellic acid, salicylic acid, cytokinins, and ethylene are known to affect trichome initiation and development. To understand the role of the plant hormone ethylene in trichome development, an Arabidopsis loss-of-function ethylene receptor mutant, etr2-3, which has completely unbranched trichomes, is analysed in this study. It was hypothesized that ETR2 might affect the assembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton based on analysis of the cytoskeleton in developing trichomes, and exposures to paclitaxol and oryzalin, which respectively act either to stabilize or depolymerize the cytoskeleton. Through epistatic and gene expression analyses it is shown that ETR2 is positioned upstream of CHROMATIN ASSEMBLY FACTOR1 and TRYPTICHON and is independent of the GLABRA2 and GLABRA3 pathways. These results help extend understanding of the early events that control trichome development and identify a signalling pathway through which ethylene affects trichome branching.
