Drought is a critical abiotic stressor that modulates soybean yield. Drought stress drastically enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and maintaining ROS content above a cytostatic level but below a cytotoxic level is essential for normal biology processes in plants. At present, most of the known ROS-scavenging systems are in the cytoplasm, and the mechanism of ROS regulation in the nucleus remains unclear. GmNTF2B-1 is a member of the IV subgroup in the nucleus transporter family. Its expression is localized to the roots and is stimulated by drought stress. In this study, the overexpression of GmNTF2B-1 was found to improve the drought tolerance of transgenic soybean by influencing the ROS content in plants. An oxidoreductase, GmOXR17, was identified to interact with GmNTF2B-1 in the nucleus through the yeast two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. The drought tolerance of GmOXR17 transgenic soybean was similar to that of GmNTF2B-1. GmNTF2B-1 was expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus, and GmOXR17 transferred from the cytoplasm to the nucleus under drought stress. The overexpression of GmNTF2B-1 enhanced the nuclear entry of GmOXR17, and the overexpression of GmNTF2B-1 or GmOXR17 could decrease the H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> content and oxidation level in the nucleus. In conclusion, the interaction between GmNTF2B-1 and GmOXR17 may enhance the nuclear entry of GmOXR17, thereby enhancing nuclear ROS scavenging to improve the drought resistance of soybean.
