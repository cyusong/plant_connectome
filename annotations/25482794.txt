In a bisexual flower, the male and female organ of which have a space separation, individing into the pistil and stamen. Due to the spatial separation between male and female pollen grains from the anther of most flowering plants, including orchids, pollens are transported by wind or animals and deposited onto the receptive surface of the stigma of a different plant. Based on observations on floral morphology and flowering phenology, tests of the breeding system, and a comparison of pollination mechanisms, a new pollination process was discovered in the hermaphroditic (i.e., possessing spatially separated male and female organs) flower of a slipper orchid, Paphiopedilum parishii. The anther changes from a solid to a liquid state and directly steps onto the stigma surface without the aid of any pollinating agent or floral assembly. The mode of pollination in Paphiopedilum parishii is a new addition to the broad range of genetic and morphological mechanisms that have evolved in flowering plants to ensure their reproductive success. The present pollination mechanism is a possible adaptation to the insect-scarce habitat of the orchid.

Pistil: !receives! Pollen
Anther: !changes to! Liquid state
Stigma: !receives! Pollen
Pollination: !ensures! Reproductive success
Insects: !scarce in! Orchid habitat
