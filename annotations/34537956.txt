Double flower is an invaluable trait in ornamental peach, but the mechanism underlying its development remains largely unknown. Here, we report the roles of ABCE model genes in double flower development in peach. A total of nine ABCE regulatory genes, including eight MADS-box genes and one AP2/EREBP gene, were identified in the peach genome. Subcellular localization assay showed that all the ABCE proteins were localized in the nucleus. Four genes, PpAP1, PpAP3, PpSEP3, and PpPI, showed a difference in expression levels between single and double flowers. Ectopic overexpression of PpPI increased petal number in Arabidopsis, while transgenic lines overexpressing PpAP3 or PpSEP3 were morphologically similar to wild-type. Ectopic overexpression of PpAP1 resulted in a significant decrease in the number of basal leaves and caused early flowering. These results suggest that PpPI is likely crucial for double flower development in peach. In addition, double flowers have petaloid sepals and stamens, and single flower could occasionally change to be double flower by converting stamens to petals in peach, suggesting that the double-flower trait is likely to have evolved from an ancestral single-flower structure. Our results provide new insights into mechanisms underlying the double-flower trait in peach.
