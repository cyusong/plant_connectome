['34904673', 'Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) UNFERTILIZED EMBRYO SAC 12 (AtUNE12) belongs  to the basic helix-loop-helix DNA-binding superfamily of proteins. However, its  function is not well known. Here, we found that AtUNE12 plays an important role  in mediating salt tolerance. AtUNE12 is a transcriptional activator located in  the nucleus whose expression is induced by NaCl, mannitol, and abscisic acid. In  addition to binding to the G-box "CACGTG", AtUNE12 also binds to the low  temperature responsive element 15 (LTRE15) "CCGAC". Furthermore, the serine  residue at position 108 of AtUNE12 is phosphorylated during the salt stress  response, enabling AtUNE12 to trigger gene expression by binding to G-box and/or  LTRE15 motifs. Phosphorylated AtUNE12 regulates the expression of the genes  involved in ion transport leading to reduced Na+ accumulation and K+ loss. At the  same time, phosphorylation of AtUNE12 also induces the expression of AtMYB61 to  decrease stomatal aperture, leading to a reduced transpiration rate. Overall,  AtUNE12 serves as a transcriptional activator that is induced and phosphorylated  upon salt stress, and the induction and phosphorylation of AtUNE12 in turn  activate the salt-overly-sensitive pathway and decrease the stomatal aperture,  enabling improved salt tolerance.', '2022 Feb 4', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiab549', 'ORCID:']
