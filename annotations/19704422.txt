Cyst nematodes are economically important pests. As obligatory biotrophic endoparasites they invade host roots and induce formation of syncytia, structures that serve them as the only source of nutrients. During syncytium development, extensive cell wall modifications take place. Cell wall dissolution occurs during cell wall opening formation, cell walls expand during hypertrophy of syncytial elements and local cell wall synthesis leads to the thickening of syncytial cell wall and the formation of cell wall ingrowths. Numerous studies revealed that nematodes change expression of plant genes encoding cell wall modifying proteins including expansins. Expansins poses unique abilities to induce cell wall extension in acidic pH. Recently, we demonstrated that two alpha-expansin genes LeEXPA4 and LeEXPA5 are upregulated in tomato roots infected with potato cyst nematode (Globodera rostochiensis). In this addendum, we present the most recent results concerning involvement of plant cell wall modifying genes in syncytium development and discuss possible practical applications of this knowledge for developing plants with resistance against nematodes.
