Masson pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.), the dominant native coniferous species in southern China, is commercially important for supplying timber and oleoresin. However, knowledge of the genetic variability of masson pine germplasm is still limited. In this study, the genetic diversity and population structure of masson pine germplasm were assessed using 204 wild accessions from 10 main distribution regions using 94,194 core single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from transcriptome sequencing data. The average expected heterozygosity was 0.2724, implying abundant genetic diversity within masson pine germplasm. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 3.29% of the variation was sourced from genetic differentiation. Structure analysis identified two geographically distinct groups. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) showed that one of those groups was further divided into two clusters. Sichuan and Chongqing provenance is the geographical origin, which diffused outward along two different lines. Oleoresin yield is reflected in the evolution of the two groups, and exhibits two different trends along the two lines of diffusion. The oleoresin yield may be associated with the genes of chitinase, CYP720B, cytochrome P450, ABC transporter, and AP2/ethylene-responsive transcription factor (ERF) based on SNPs and expression. SNP markers from transcriptome sequencing are highly capable of evaluating genetic diversity within different species, as well as the genetic control of objective traits. The functions of these genes will be verified in future studies, and those genes strongly associated with oleoresin yield will be used to improve yields by means of early genotype selection and genetic engineering.
