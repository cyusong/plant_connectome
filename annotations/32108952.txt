Phytopathogen infection alters primary metabolism status and plant development. The alternative oxidase (AOX) has been hypothesized to increase under pathogen attack preventing reductions, thus optimizing photosynthesis and growth. In this study, two genotypes of Medicago truncatula, one relatively resistant (Jemalong A17) and one susceptible (TN1.11), were infected with Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani. The in vivo foliar respiratory activities of the cytochrome oxidase pathway (COP) and the alternative oxidase pathway (AOP) were measured using the oxygen isotope fractionation. Gas exchange and photosynthesis-related parameters were measured and calculated together with antioxidant enzymes activities and organic acids contents. Our results show that the in vivo activity of AOX (v<sub>alt</sub> ) plays a role under fungal infection. When infected with R. solani, the increase of v<sub>alt</sub> in A17 was concomitant to an increase in net assimilation, in mesophyll conductance, to an improvement in the maximum velocity of Rubisco carboxylation and to unchanged malate content. However, under F. oxysporum infection, the induced v<sub>alt</sub> was accompanied by an enhancement in the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT; EC1.11.1.6) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX; EC1.11.1.7), activities and to an unchanged tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. These results provide new insight into the role of the in vivo activity of AOX in coordinating primary metabolism interactions that, partly, modulate the relative resistance of M. truncatula to diseases caused by soil-borne pathogenic fungi.
