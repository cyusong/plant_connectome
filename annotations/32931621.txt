Short-term temperature response curves of leaf dark respiration (R-T) provide insights into a critical process that influences plant net carbon exchange. This includes how respiratory traits acclimate to sustained changes in the environment. Our study analysed 860 high-resolution R-T (10-70°C range) curves for: (a) 62 evergreen species measured in two contrasting seasons across several field sites/biomes; and (b) 21 species (subset of those sampled in the field) grown in glasshouses at 20°C : 15°C, 25°C : 20°C and 30°C : 25°C, day : night. In the field, across all sites/seasons, variations in R<sub>25</sub> (measured at 25°C) and the leaf T where R reached its maximum (T<sub>max</sub> ) were explained by growth T (mean air-T of 30-d before measurement), solar irradiance and vapour pressure deficit, with growth T having the strongest influence. R<sub>25</sub> decreased and T<sub>max</sub> increased with rising growth T across all sites and seasons with the single exception of winter at the cool-temperate rainforest site where irradiance was low. The glasshouse study confirmed that R<sub>25</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> thermally acclimated. Collectively, the results suggest: (1) thermal acclimation of leaf R is common in most biomes; and (2) the high T threshold of respiration dynamically adjusts upward when plants are challenged with warmer and hotter climates.
