The presence of phyto-hormones in plants at relatively low concentrations plays an indispensable role in regulating crop growth and yield. Salt stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting cotton production. It has been reported that exogenous phyto-hormones are involved in various plant defense systems against salt stress. Recently, different studies revealed the pivotal performance of hormones in regulating cotton growth and yield. However, a comprehensive understanding of these exogenous hormones, which regulate cotton growth and yield under salt stress, is lacking. In this review, we focused on new advances in elucidating the roles of exogenous hormones (gibberellin (GA) and salicylic acid (SA)) and their signaling and transduction pathways and the cross-talk between GA and SA in regulating crop growth and development under salt stress. In this review, we not only focused on the role of phyto-hormones but also identified the roles of GA and SA responsive genes to salt stress. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive review of the performance of GA and SA and their responsive genes under salt stress, assisting in the further elucidation of the mechanism that plant hormones use to regulate growth and yield under salt stress.

phyto-hormones: !regulate! crop growth and yield
GA: !regulates! SA
SA: !regulates! GA
GA/SA: !cross-talk! to regulate crop growth and development
GA/SA responsive genes: !regulate! salt stress
