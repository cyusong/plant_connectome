The plant hormone gibberellin (GA) regulates multiple developmental processes. It accumulates in the root elongating endodermis, but how it moves into this cell file and the significance of this accumulation are unclear. Here we identify three NITRATE TRANSPORTER1/PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER (NPF) transporters required for GA and abscisic acid (ABA) translocation. We demonstrate that NPF2.14 is a subcellular GA/ABA transporter, presumably the first to be identified in plants, facilitating GA and ABA accumulation in the root endodermis to regulate suberization. Further, NPF2.12 and NPF2.13, closely related proteins, are plasma membrane-localized GA and ABA importers that facilitate shoot-to-root GA<sub>12</sub> translocation, regulating endodermal hormone accumulation. This work reveals that GA is required for root suberization and that GA and ABA can act non-antagonistically. We demonstrate how the clade of transporters mediates hormone flow with cell-file-specific vacuolar storage at the phloem unloading zone, and slow release of hormone to induce suberin formation in the maturation zone.
