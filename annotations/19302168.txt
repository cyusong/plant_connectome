Tomato crop productivity under salinity can be improved by grafting cultivars onto salt-tolerant wild relatives, thus mediating the supply of root-derived ionic and hormonal factors that regulate leaf area and senescence. A tomato cultivar was grafted onto rootstocks from a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a Solanum lycopersicum x Solanum cheesmaniae cross and cultivated under moderate salinity (75 mM NaCl). Concentrations of Na(+), K(+) and several phytohormones [abscisic acid (ABA); the cytokinins (CKs) zeatin, Z; zeatin riboside, ZR; and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)] were analysed in leaf xylem sap in graft combinations of contrasting vigour. Scion leaf area correlated with photosystem II (PSII) efficiency (F(v)/F(m)) and determined fruit productivity. Xylem K(+) (but not Na(+)), K(+)/Na(+), the active CK Z, the ratio with its storage form Z/ZR and especially the ratio between CKs and ACC (Z/ACC and Z + ZR/ACC) were positively loaded into the first principal component (PC) determining both leaf growth and PSII efficiency. In contrast, the ratio ACC/ABA was negatively correlated with leaf biomass. Although the underlying physiological mechanisms by which rootstocks mediate leaf area or chlorophyll fluorescence (and thus influence tomato salt tolerance) seem complex, a putative potassium-CK interaction involved in regulating both processes merits further attention.
