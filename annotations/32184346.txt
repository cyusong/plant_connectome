Terpene volatiles are found in many important fruit crops, but their relationship to flavor is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate using sensory descriptive and discriminant analysis that 1,8-cineole contributes a key floral/eucalyptus note to the aroma of ripe 'Hort16A' kiwifruit (<i>Actinidia chinensis</i>). Two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 1,8-cineole production were identified on linkage groups 27 and 29a in a segregating <i>A. chinensis</i> population, with the QTL on LG29a colocating with a complex cluster of putative terpene synthase (TPS)-encoding genes. Transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and analysis of recombinant proteins expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed four genes in the cluster (<i>AcTPS1a</i>-AcTPS1<i>d</i>) encoded functional TPS enzymes, which produced predominantly sabinene, 1,8-cineole, geraniol, and springene, respectively. The terpene profile produced by AcTPS1b closely resembled the terpenes detected in red-fleshed <i>A</i> <i>chinensis</i> <i>AcTPS1b</i> expression correlated with 1,8-cineole content in developing/ripening fruit and also showed a positive correlation with 1,8-cineole content in the mapping population, indicating the basis for segregation is an expression QTL. Transient overexpression of <i>AcTPS1b</i> in <i>Actinidia eriantha</i> fruit confirmed this gene produced 1,8-cineole in <i>Actinidia</i> Structure-function analysis showed AcTPS1a and AcTPS1b are natural variants at key TPS catalytic site residues previously shown to change enzyme specificity in vitro. Together, our results indicate that <i>AcTPS1b</i> is a key gene for production of the signature flavor terpene 1,8-cineole in ripe kiwifruit. Using a sensory-directed strategy for compound identification provides a rational approach for applying marker-aided selection to improving flavor in kiwifruit as well as other fruits.
