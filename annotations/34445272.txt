As sessile organisms, plants must tolerate various environmental stresses. Plant hormones play vital roles in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Among these hormones, jasmonic acid (JA) and its precursors and derivatives (jasmonates, JAs) play important roles in the mediation of plant responses and defenses to biotic and abiotic stresses and have received extensive research attention. Although some reviews of JAs are available, this review focuses on JAs in the regulation of plant stress responses, as well as JA synthesis, metabolism, and signaling pathways. We summarize recent progress in clarifying the functions and mechanisms of JAs in plant responses to abiotic stresses (drought, cold, salt, heat, and heavy metal toxicity) and biotic stresses (pathogen, insect, and herbivore). Meanwhile, the crosstalk of JA with various other plant hormones regulates the balance between plant growth and defense. Therefore, we review the crosstalk of JAs with other phytohormones, including auxin, gibberellic acid, salicylic acid, brassinosteroid, ethylene, and abscisic acid. Finally, we discuss current issues and future opportunities in research into JAs in plant stress responses.
