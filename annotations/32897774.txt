is a gram-positive phytopathogen that infects a wide range of plant species. The actinomycete induces the formation of neoplastic growths, termed leafy galls, that consist of a gall body covered by small shoots of which the outgrowth is arrested due to an extreme form of apical dominance. In our previous work, we demonstrated that in the developing gall, auxin drives the transdifferentiation of parenchyma cells into vascular elements. In this work, with the use of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants carrying molecular reporters for cell division (<i>pCYCB1;1:GUS</i>) and meristematic activity (<i>pSTM:GUS</i>), we analyzed the fate of cells within the leafy gall. Our results indicate that the size of the gall body is determined by ongoing mitotic cell divisions as illustrated by strong <i>CYCB1;1</i> expression combined with the <i>de novo</i> formation of new meristematic areas triggered by <i>STM</i> expression. The shoot meristems that develop in the peripheral parts of the gall are originating from high ectopic <i>STM</i> expression. Altogether the presented data provide further insight into the cellular events that accompany the development of leafy galls in response to <i>R. fascians</i> infection.
