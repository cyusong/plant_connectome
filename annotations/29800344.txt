Potato is the most economically important non-cereal food crop. Tuber formation in potato is regulated by phytohormones, cytokinins (CKs) in particular. The present work studied CK signal perception in potato. The sequenced potato genome of doubled monoploid Phureja was used for bioinformatic analysis and as a tool for identification of putative CK receptors from autotetraploid potato cv. Désirée. All basic elements of multistep phosphorelay required for CK signal transduction were identified in the Phureja genome, including three genes orthologous to three CK receptor genes (AHK 2-4) of Arabidopsis. As distinct from Phureja, autotetraploid potato contains at least two allelic isoforms of each receptor type. Putative receptor genes from Désirée plants were cloned, sequenced and expressed, and the main characteristics of encoded proteins were determined, in particular their consensus motifs, modelled structure, ligand-binding properties, and ability to transmit CK signals. In all studied aspects the predicted sensor histidine kinases met the requirements for genuine CK receptors. Expression of potato CK receptors was found to be organ-specific and sensitive to growth conditions, particularly to sucrose content. Our results provide a solid basis for further in-depth study of CK signaling system and biotechnological improvement of potato.
