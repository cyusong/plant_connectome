The class IV Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP IV) gene family includes several genes that are functionally significant in epidermal development. Our recent study revealed that double mutants of the epidermis-expressed HD-ZIP IV members, PROTODERMAL FACTOR2 (PDF2) in combination with some HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS (HDG, pronounced "hedge") genes, affect stamen development and specification of petal and stamen identity, possibly in a non cell-autonomous manner. However, the effect of the pdf2 mutations on the floral development was largely different depending on T-DNA insertion locations: pdf2-1 hdg flowers exhibited homeotic conversion of petals and stamens, while pdf2-2 hdg flowers had only a reduced number of stamens. Here, we used 2 additional pdf2 alleles to make double mutants and found that their floral phenotypes were rather similar to those of pdf2-2 hdg. The allele-specific effect caused by pdf2-1, which carries a T-DNA in a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain-encoding region, suggests the importance of the START domain in proper function of HD-ZIP IV proteins.
