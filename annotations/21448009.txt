Stromules are extended by plastids but the underlying basis for their extension and retraction had not been understood until recently. Our live-imaging aided observations on coincident plastid stromule branching and ER tubule dynamics open out new areas of investigation relating to these rapid subcellular interactions. The addendum provides a testable hypothesis on the formation of stromules, which argues against the need for new membrane incorporation and suggests that stromal extensions might result from a remodeling of the plastid envelope membrane in an ER aided manner.
