La(3+) ions are known to antagonize Ca(2+) and are used as a Ca(2+) channel blocker but little is known on the direct effects of La(3+). Micromolar La(3+) concentrations promoted root growth while higher concentrations were inhibitory. The uptake of La(3+) in maize root protoplasts revealed a membrane binding component (0.14 and 0.44 pmol min(-1) protoplast(-1) for 100 and 1,000 microM La(3+)) followed by a slower concentration and time-dependent uptake. Uptake was reduced by Ca(2+), but had no substantial effect on other ions. La(3+) shifted microtubule organization from random to parallel but caused aggregation of microfilaments. Our data suggest that La(3+) is taken up into plant cells and affects growth via stabilization of the cytoskeleton.
