['31904040', 'Stomatal pores, which are surrounded by pairs of guard cells in the plant  epidermis, regulate gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere, thereby  controlling photosynthesis and transpiration. Blue light works as a signal to  guard cells, to induce intracellular signaling and open stomata. Blue light  receptor phototropins (phots) are activated by blue light; phot-mediated signals  promote plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase activity via C-terminal Thr  phosphorylation, serving as the driving force for stomatal opening in guard  cells. However, the details of this signaling process are not fully understood.  In this study, through an in vitro screening of phot-interacting protein kinases,  we obtained the CBC1 and CBC2 that had been reported as signal transducers in  stomatal opening. Promoter activities of CBC1 and CBC2 indicated that both genes  were expressed in guard cells. Single and double knockout mutants of CBC1 and  CBC2 showed no lesions in the context of phot-mediated phototropism, chloroplast  movement, or leaf flattening. In contrast, the cbc1cbc2 double mutant showed  larger stomatal opening under both dark and blue light conditions. Interestingly,  the level of phosphorylation of C-terminal Thr of PM H+-ATPase was higher in  double mutant guard cells. The larger stomatal openings of the double mutant were  effectively suppressed by the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). CBC1 and CBC2  interacted with BLUS1 and PM H+-ATPase in vitro. From these results, we conclude  that CBC1 and CBC2 act as negative regulators of stomatal opening, probably via  inhibition of PM H+-ATPase activity.', '2020 Jan 22', 'Photochem Photobiol Sci', '10.1039/c9pp00329k', 'Inoue']
