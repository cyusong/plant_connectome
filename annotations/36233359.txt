Common wheat, <i>Triticum aestivum</i>, is the most widely grown staple crop worldwide. To catch up with the increasing global population and cope with the changing climate, it is valuable to breed wheat cultivars that are tolerant to abiotic or shade stresses for density farming. <i>Arabidopsis</i> LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED 1 (AtHFR1), a photomorphogenesis-promoting factor, is involved in multiple light-related signaling pathways and inhibits seedling etiolation and shade avoidance. We report that overexpression of <i>AtHFR1</i> in wheat inhibits etiolation phenotypes under various light and shade conditions, leading to shortened plant height and increased spike number relative to non-transgenic plants in the field. Ectopic expression of <i>AtHFR1</i> in wheat increases the transcript levels of <i>TaCAB</i> and <i>TaCHS</i> as observed previously in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, indicating that the <i>AtHFR1</i> transgene can activate the light signal transduction pathway in wheat. <i>AtHFR1</i> transgenic seedlings significantly exhibit tolerance to osmotic stress during seed germination compared to non-transgenic wheat. The <i>AtHFR1</i> transgene represses transcription of <i>TaFT1</i>, <i>TaCO1</i>, and <i>TaCO2</i>, delaying development of the shoot apex and heading in wheat. Furthermore, the <i>AtHFR1</i> transgene in wheat inhibits transcript levels of <i>PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKEs</i> (<i>TaPIL13</i>, <i>TaPIL15-1B</i>, and <i>TaPIL15-1D</i>), downregulating the target gene <i>STAYGREEN</i> (<i>TaSGR</i>), and thus delaying dark-induced leaf senescence. In the field, grain yields of three <i>AtHFR1</i> transgenic lines were 18.2-48.1% higher than those of non-transgenic wheat. In summary, genetic modification of light signaling pathways using a photomorphogenesis-promoting factor has positive effects on grain yield due to changes in plant architecture and resource allocation and enhances tolerances to osmotic stress and shade avoidance response.
