['17726100', 'Current understanding of the integration of cell division and expansion in the  development of plant lateral organs such as leaves is limited. Cell number is  established during a mitotic phase, and subsequent growth into a mature organ  relies primarily on cell expansion accompanied by endocycles. Here we show that  the three Arabidopsis cyclin D3 (CYCD3) genes are expressed in overlapping but  distinct patterns in developing lateral organs and the shoot meristem. Triple  loss-of-function mutants show that CYCD3 function is essential neither for the  mitotic cell cycle nor for morphogenesis. Rather, analysis of mutant and  reciprocal overexpression phenotypes shows that CYCD3 function contributes to the  control of cell number in developing leaves by regulating the duration of the  mitotic phase and timing of the transition to endocycles. Petals, which normally  do not endoreduplicate, respond to loss of CYCD3 function with larger cells that  initiate endocycles. The phytohormone cytokinin regulates cell division in the  shoot meristem and developing leaves and induces CYCD3 expression. Loss of CYCD3  impairs shoot meristem function and leads to reduced cytokinin responses,  including the inability to initiate shoots on callus, without affecting  endogenous cytokinin levels. We conclude that CYCD3 activity is important for  determining cell number in developing lateral organs and the relative  contribution of the alternative processes of cell production and cell expansion  to overall organ growth, as well as mediating cytokinin effects in apical growth  and development.', '2007 Sep 4', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0704166104', 'Murray']
