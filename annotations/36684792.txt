The Asian citrus psyllid, <i>Diaphorina citri</i> Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is a key vector of the causal agents of Huanglongbing (HLB), a devastating disease affecting citrus almost worldwide. <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> L. is an important commercial crop in China. Field observations suggested that <i>D. citri</i> adults die on <i>N. tabacum</i> leaves when grown nearby citrus orchards. In this study, the preference for and survivorship of <i>D. citri</i> adults on <i>N. tabacum</i> and their feeding behavior were investigated. The results showed that <i>D. citri</i> adults were attracted to <i>N. tabacum</i> and to the green leaf volatiles (GLVs) (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenol and (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenol. The survival of <i>D. citri</i> adults on <i>N. tabacum</i> was less than 30 h, which was shorter than that for adults without food (35 h) and on a suitable host <i>Murraya exotica</i> L. (29 days). Electrical penetration graph (EPG) recordings revealed that the pathway phase of <i>D. citri</i> on <i>N. tabacum</i> leaves consisted of four waveforms-the non-probing phase (NP), the pathway phase (PP, including intercellular probing of activity in the phloem (C) and phloem penetration (D)), phloem salivation (E1), and phloem ingestion (E2). <i>Diaphorina citri</i> only secreted saliva and ingested sap from phloem on <i>N. tabacum</i> leaves and spent the longest duration in phloem sap ingestion (E2). Moreover, L-nicotine, an important defense compound against insects in <i>N. tabacum</i> plants, was highly toxic to <i>D. citri</i>. These results suggested that <i>N. tabacum</i> plants could help to sustainably control the spread of <i>D. citri</i> and HLB when growing in and around citrus orchards.
