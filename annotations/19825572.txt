Magnesium is an abundant divalent cation in plant cells and plays a critical role in many physiological processes. We have previously described the identification of a 10-member Arabidopsis gene family encoding putative magnesium transport (MGT) proteins. Here, we report that a member of the MGT family, AtMGT5, functions as a dual-functional Mg-transporter that operates in a concentration-dependent manner, namely it serves as a Mg-importer at micromolar levels and facilitates the efflux in the millimolar range. The AtMGT5 protein is localized in the mitochondria, suggesting that AtMGT5 mediates Mg-trafficking between the cytosol and mitochondria. The AtMGT5 gene was exclusively expressed in anthers at early stages of flower development. Examination of two independent T-DNA insertional mutants of AtMGT5 gene demonstrated that AtMGT5 played an essential role for pollen development and male fertility. This study suggests a critical role for Mg(2+) transport between cytosol and mitochondria in male gametogenesis in plants.
