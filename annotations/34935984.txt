Development of the endosperm is strikingly different in monocots and dicots: it often manifests as a persistent tissue in the former and transient tissue in the latter. Little is known about the controlling mechanisms responsible for these different outcomes. Here we characterized a maize (Zea mays) mutant, endosperm breakdown1 (enb1), in which the typically persistent endosperm (PE) was drastically degraded during kernel development. ENB1 encodes a cellulose synthase 5 that is predominantly expressed in the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) of endosperm cells. Loss of ENB1 function caused a drastic reduction in formation of flange cell wall ingrowths (ingrowths) in BETL cells. Defective ingrowths impair nutrient uptake, leading to premature utilization of endosperm starch to nourish the embryo. Similarly, developing wild-type kernels cultured in vitro with a low level of sucrose manifested early endosperm breakdown. ENB1 expression is induced by sucrose via the BETL-specific Myb-Related Protein1 transcription factor. Overexpression of ENB1 enhanced development of flange ingrowths, facilitating sucrose transport into BETL cells and increasing kernel weight. The results demonstrated that ENB1 enhances sucrose supply to the endosperm and contributes to a PE in the kernel.
