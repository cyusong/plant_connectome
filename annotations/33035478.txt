In the course of their growth and development, plants have to constantly perceive and react to their environment. This is achieved in cells by the coordination of complex combinatorial signaling networks. However, how signal integration and specificity are achieved in this context is unknown. With a focus on the hyperosmotic stimulus, we use live super-resolution light imaging methods to demonstrate that a Rho GTPase, Rho-of-Plant 6 (ROP6), forms stimuli-dependent nanodomains within the plasma membrane (PM). These nanodomains are necessary and sufficient to transduce production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that act as secondary messengers and trigger several plant adaptive responses to osmotic constraints. Furthermore, osmotic signal triggers interaction between ROP6 and two NADPH oxidases that subsequently generate ROS. ROP6 nanoclustering is also needed for cell surface auxin signaling, but short-time auxin treatment does not induce ROS accumulation. We show that auxin-induced ROP6 nanodomains, unlike osmotically driven ROP6 clusters, do not recruit the NADPH oxidase, RBOHD. Together, our results suggest that Rho GTPase nano-partitioning at the PM ensures signal specificity downstream of independent stimuli.
