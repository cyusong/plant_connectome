Crop plant resistance against pathogens is governed by dynamic molecular and biochemical responses driven by complex transcriptional networks. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. Here we report an interesting role of HvWRKY23 transcription factor (TF) in modulating defense response against Fusarium head blight (FHB) in barley. The combined approach of gene silencing, metabolomics, real time expression analysis and ab initio bioinformatics tools led to the identification of the HvWRKY23 role in FHB resistance. The knock-down of HvWRKY23 gene in the FHB resistant barley genotype CI9831, followed by inoculation with Fusarium graminearum, led to the down regulation of key flavonoid and hydroxycinnamic acid amide biosynthetic genes resulting in reduced accumulation of resistant related (RR) secondary metabolites such as pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, peonidin 3-rhamnoside-5-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-arabinoside and other flavonoid glycosides. Reduced abundances of RR metabolites in TF silenced plants were also associated with an increased proportion of spikelets diseased and amount of fungal biomass in spikelets, depicting the role of HvWRKY23 in disease resistance. The luciferase reporter assay demonstrated binding of HvWRKY23 protein to promoters of key flavonoid and hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAA) biosynthetic genes, such as HvPAL2, HvCHS1, HvHCT, HvLAC15 and HvUDPGT. The accumulation of high abundances of HCAAs and flavonoid glycosides reinforce cell walls to contain the pathogen to initial infection area. This gene in commercial cultivars can be edited, if non-functional, to enhance resistance against FHB.
