Pipecolic acid (Pip) is an essential component of systemic acquired resistance, priming resistance in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> against (hemi)biotrophic pathogens. Here, we studied the potential role of Pip in bacteria-induced systemic immunity in barley. Exudates of barley leaves infected with the systemic immunity-inducing pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>japonica</i> induced immune responses in <i>A. thaliana.</i> The same leaf exudates contained elevated Pip levels compared with those of mock-treated barley leaves. Exogenous application of Pip induced resistance in barley against the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen <i>Xanthomonas translucens</i> pv. <i>cerealis</i>. Furthermore, both a systemic immunity-inducing infection and exogenous application of Pip enhanced the resistance of barley against the biotrophic powdery mildew pathogen <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>. In contrast to a systemic immunity-inducing infection, Pip application did not influence lesion formation by a systemically applied inoculum of the necrotrophic fungus <i>Pyrenophora teres</i>. Nitric oxide (NO) levels in barley leaves increased after Pip application. Furthermore, <i>X. translucens</i> pv. <i>cerealis</i> induced the accumulation of superoxide anion radicals and this response was stronger in Pip-pretreated compared with mock-pretreated plants. Thus, the data suggest that Pip induces barley innate immune responses by triggering NO and priming reactive oxygen species accumulation.
