['24498334', 'Flowering at the appropriate time is crucial for reproductive success and is  strongly influenced by various pathways such as photoperiod, circadian clock,  FRIGIDA and vernalization. Although each separate pathway has been extensively  studied, much less is known about the interactions between them. In this study we  have investigated the relationship between the photoperiod/circadian clock gene  and FRIGIDA/FLC by characterizing the function of the B-box STO gene family. STO  has two B-box Zn-finger domains but lacks the CCT domain. Its expression is  controlled by circadian rhythm and is affected by environmental factors and  phytohormones. Loss and gain of function mutants show diversiform phenotypes from  seed germination to flowering. The sto-1 mutant flowers later than the wild type  (WT) under short day growth conditions, while over-expression of STO causes early  flowering both in long and short days. STO over-expression not only reduces FLC  expression level but it also activates FT and SOC1 expression. It also does not  rely on the other B-box gene CO or change the circadian clock system to activate  FT and SOC1. Furthermore, the STO activation of FT and SOC1 expression is  independent of the repression of FLC; rather STO and FLC compete with each other  to regulate downstream genes. Our results indicate that photoperiod and the  circadian clock pathway gene STO can affect the key flowering time genes FLC and  FT/SOC1 separately, and reveals a novel perspective to the mechanism of flowering  regulation.', '2014', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0087544', 'Holm']
