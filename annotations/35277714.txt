Hemipterans (such as aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers) are some of the most devastating insect pests due to the numerous plant pathogens they transmit as vectors, which are primarily viral. Over the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in broadening our understanding of plant-virus-vector interactions, yet on the molecular level, viruses and vectors have typically been studied in isolation of each other until recently. From that work, it is clear that both hemipteran vectors and viruses use effectors to manipulate host physiology and successfully colonize a plant and that co-evolutionary dynamics have resulted in effective host immune responses, as well as diverse mechanisms of counterattack by both challengers. In this review, we focus on advances in effector-mediated plant-virus-vector interactions and the underlying mechanisms. We propose that molecular synergisms in vector-virus interactions occur in cases where both the virus and vector benefit from the interaction (mutualism). To support this view, we show that mutualisms are common in virus-vector interactions and that virus and vector effectors target conserved mechanisms of plant immunity, including plant transcription factors, and plant protein degradation pathways. Finally, we outline ways to identify true effector synergisms in the future and propose future research directions concerning the roles effectors play in plant-virus-vector interactions.
