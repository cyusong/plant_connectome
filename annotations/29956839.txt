Kin recognition is an important mediator of interactions within individuals of a species. Despite increasing evidence of kin recognition in natural plant populations, relatively little is known about kin recognition in crop species where numerous cultivars have been generated by artificial selection. We identified rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars with the ability for kin recognition from two sets of indica-inbred and indica-hybrid lines at different levels of genetic relatedness. We then assessed this ability among kin and nonkin and tested potential mechanisms in a series of controlled experiments and field trails. Rice cultivars with the ability for kin recognition were capable of detecting the presence of kin and nonkin and responded to them by altering root behavior and biomass allocation, particularly for grain yield. Furthermore, we assessed the role of root exudates and found a root-secreted nitrogen-rich allantoin component to be responsible for kin recognition in rice lines. Kin recognition in rice lines mediated by root exudates occurs in a cultivar-dependent manner. Rice cultivars with the ability for kin recognition may increase grain yield in the presence of kin. Such an improvement of grain yield by kin recognition of cultivar mixtures offers many implications and applications in rice production.
