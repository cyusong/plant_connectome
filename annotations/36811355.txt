Polyadenylation of mRNAs is critical for their export from the nucleus, stability, and efficient translation. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes three isoforms of canonical nuclear poly(A) polymerase (PAPS) that redundantly polyadenylate the bulk of pre-mRNAs. However, previous studies have indicated that subsets of pre-mRNAs are preferentially polyadenylated by either PAPS1 or the other two isoforms. Such functional specialization raises the possibility of an additional level of gene-expression control in plants. Here we test this notion by studying the function of PAPS1 in pollen-tube growth and guidance. Pollen tubes growing through female tissue acquire the competence to find ovules efficiently and upregulate PAPS1 expression at the transcriptional, but not detectably at the protein level compared with in vitro grown pollen tubes. Using the temperature-sensitive paps1-1 allele we show that PAPS1 activity during pollen-tube growth is required for full acquisition of competence, resulting in inefficient fertilization by paps1-1 mutant pollen tubes. While these mutant pollen tubes grow almost at the wild-type rate, they are compromised in locating the micropyles of ovules. Previously identified competence-associated genes are less expressed in paps1-1 mutant than in wild-type pollen tubes. Estimating the poly(A) tail lengths of transcripts suggests that polyadenylation by PAPS1 is associated with reduced transcript abundance. Our results therefore suggest that PAPS1 plays a key role in the acquisition of competence and underline the importance of functional specialization between PAPS isoforms throughout different developmental stages.
