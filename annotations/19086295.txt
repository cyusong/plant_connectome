G-proteins (guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that usually exhibit GTPase activities) and related signal transduction processes play important roles in mediating plant defense responses; here, a rice (Oryza sativa) cDNA clone, OsGAP1, encoding a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that also contains a protein kinase C conserved region 2 (C2) domain is reported. An interacting G-protein partner for the OsGAP1 protein was identified by yeast two-hybrid library screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation; the GTPase-activation activity of OsGAP1 on this interacting G-protein was demonstrated using in vitro assays. OsGAP1 was induced by wounding in rice and the presence of the R locus Xa14 enhances such induction. Gain-of-function tests in transgenic rice and Arabidopsis thaliana showed that constitutive expression of OsGAP1 led to increased resistance to bacterial pathogens in both monocots and dicots.
