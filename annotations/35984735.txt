The cuticular wax layer on leaf surfaces limits non-stomatal water loss to the atmosphere and protects against pathogen invasion. Although many genes associated with wax biosynthesis and wax transport in plants have been identified, their regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the MYB transcription factor OsMYB60 positively regulates cuticular wax biosynthesis and this helps rice (Oryza sativa) plants tolerate drought stress. Compared with the wild type (japonica cultivar 'Dongjin'), osmyb60 null mutants (osmyb60-1 and osmyb60-2) exhibited increased drought sensitivity, with more chlorophyll leaching and higher rates of water loss. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR showed that the loss of function of OsMYB60 led to downregulation of wax biosynthesis genes, leading to reduced amounts of total wax components on leaf surfaces under normal conditions. Yeast one-hybrid, luciferase transient transcriptional activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that OsMYB60 directly binds to the promoter of OsCER1 (a key gene involved in very-long-chain alkane biosynthesis) and upregulates its expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that OsMYB60 enhances rice resilience to drought stress by promoting cuticular wax biosynthesis on leaf surfaces.
