['15811335', 'Functional expression studies in microorganisms showed that the Arabidopsis  thaliana gene At4g04870 represents the cardiolipin synthase (CLS) gene encoding a  hydrophobic preprotein of 38 kDa with a cleavable signal peptide for the import  into mitochondria. CLS of Arabidopsis over-expressed in Escherichia coli has an  alkaline pH optimum, a strict requirement for divalent cations and a distinctly  lower K(m) for cytidinediphosphate-diacylglycerol than for phosphatidylglycerol.  It displayed a preference for both its substrates esterified with unsaturated  acyl groups. Solubilization and purification experiments revealed that the  protein requires a defined phospholipid environment, particularly the presence of  cardiolipin, to acquire its catalytically active conformation.', '2005 Apr 11', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2005.03.007', 'Frentzen']
