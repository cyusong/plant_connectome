Weed management is critical to global crop production and is complicated by rapidly evolving herbicide resistance in weeds. New sources of herbicide resistance are needed for crop plants so that applied herbicides can be rotated or combined to thwart the evolution of resistant weeds. The diverse family of cytochrome P450 proteins has been suggested to be a source of detoxifying herbicide metabolism in both weed and crop plants, and greater understanding of these genes will offer avenues for crop improvement and novel weed management practices. Here, we report the identification of CYP749A16 (Gh_D10G1401) which is responsible for the natural tolerance exhibited by most cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., cultivars to the herbicide trifloxysulfuron sodium (TFS, CGA 362622, commercial formulation Envoke). A 1-bp frameshift insertion in the third exon of CYP749A16 results in the loss of tolerance to TFS. The DNA marker designed from this insertion perfectly co-segregated with the phenotype in 2145 F<sub>2</sub> progeny of a cross between the sensitive cultivar Paymaster HS26 and tolerant cultivar Stoneville 474, and in 550 recombinant inbred lines of a multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross population. Marker analysis of 382 additional cotton cultivars identified twelve cultivars containing the 1-bp frameshift insertion. The marker genotypes matched perfectly with phenotypes in 188 plants from the selected twelve cultivars. Virus-induced gene silencing of CYP749A16 generated sensitivity in the tolerant cotton cultivar Stoneville 474. CYP749A16 located on chromosome D10 is required for TFS herbicide tolerance in cotton. This finding should add to the repertoire of tools available to farmers and breeders for the advancement of agricultural productivity.
