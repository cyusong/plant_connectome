['17114575', 'The proper timing of flowering is critical for successful reproduction. The  perception of the seasonal cues of day-length changes and exposure to cold  influences flowering time in many plant species through the photoperiod and  vernalization pathways, respectively. Here we show that a plant homeodomain (PHD)  finger-containing protein, VIN3-LIKE 1 (VIL1), participates in both the  photoperiod and vernalization pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana by regulating  expression of the related floral repressors FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING  LOCUS M (FLM). In the vernalization pathway, VIL1, along with VERNALIZATION  INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3), is necessary for the modifications to FLC and FLM chromatin  that are associated with an epigenetically silenced state and with acquisition of  competence to flower. In addition, VIL1 regulates FLM independently of VIN3 in a  photoperiod-dependent manner.', '2006 Dec 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1493306', 'Amasino']
