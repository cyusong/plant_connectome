Glycosyltransferase (GT) family-1, the biggest GT family in plants, typically participates in modification of small molecules and affects many aspects during plant development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, although some UDP glycosyltransferases (UGTs) of family-1 have been functionally characterized, functions of most the UGTs remain unknown or fragmentary. Here, we report data for the Arabidopsis UGT87A2, a stress-regulated GT. We found that UGT87A2 could be dramatically induced by salinity, osmotic stress, drought and ABA. Overexpression of UGT87A2 (87A2OE) leads to accelerated germination and greening, higher survival rate as well as increased root length against abiotic stresses compared with those of wild-type (WT) plants. In addition, we observed lower water loss rate in the 87A2OE plants due to smaller stomatal apertures. The transgenic plants also showed reduced levels of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide under low water status compared with those of WT plants. Consistently, function loss of UGT87A2 in ugt87a2 knockout lines resulted in opposite performances under these conditions. A transcriptome profiling revealed that 121 genes were differentially regulated upon UGT87A2 overexpression, and a large number of stress-induced genes were upregulated in UGT87A2 overexpression plants. Expression of seven genes among them were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), including CPK32, CYP81F2, MYB96, DREB2A, FBS1, PUB23 and RAV2 under both control and stress treatments, and the results greatly validated our transcriptome data. Taken together, our findings support an explicit role of UGT87A2 in adaptation to abiotic stresses.
