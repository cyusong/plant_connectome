In angiosperms, double fertilization of the egg and central cell of the megagametophyte leads to the development of the embryo and endosperm, respectively. Control of cell cycle progression in the megagametophyte is essential for successful fertilization and development. Central cell-targeted expression of the D-type cyclin CYCD7;1 (end CYCD7;1) using the imprinted FWA promoter overcomes cycle arrest of the central cell in the Arabidopsis female gametophyte in the unfertilized ovule, leading to multinucleate central cells at high frequency. Unlike FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED (fis) mutants, but similar to lethal RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (rbr) mutants, no seed coat development is triggered. Unlike the case with loss of rbr, post-fertilization end CYCD7;1 in the endosperm enhances the number of nuclei during syncytial endosperm development and induces the partial abortion of developing seeds, associated with the enhanced size of the surviving seeds. The frequency of lethality was less than the frequency of multinucleate central cells, indicating that these aspects are not causally linked. These larger seeds contain larger embryos composed of more cells of wild-type size, surrounded by a seed coat composed of more cells. Seedlings arising from these larger seeds displayed faster seedling establishment and early growth. Similarly, two different embryo-lethal mutants also conferred enlarged seed size in surviving siblings, consistent with seed size increase being a general response to sibling lethality, although the cellular mechanisms were found to be distinct. Our data suggest that tight control of CYCD activity in the central cell and in the developing endosperm is required for optimal seed formation.
