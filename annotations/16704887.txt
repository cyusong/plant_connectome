The interaction and conformational relationships between rRNAs and ribosomal proteins are responsible for ribosome activity. We tested seven different deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to the selected, highly conserved sequences of 18S rRNAs important in protein biosynthesis. We carried out a reaction of binding Phe-tRNA to A site on the ribosomes converted either to pre- or to post-translocational states (with or without pre-hybridized oligonucleotides). We found a correlation between the level of oligomer hybridization and the inhibition of AA-tRNA binding. We observed well-defined structural changes of ribosome's conformation during different steps of the elongation cycle of protein biosynthesis.
