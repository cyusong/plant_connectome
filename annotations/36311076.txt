The oriental armyworm <i>Mythimna separata</i> (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) can feed on the leaves of many crops, resulting in vast areas of damage and severe losses. Therefore, this insect has become a significant agricultural pest in north Asia. In this study, we fed 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae with artificial diets containing different concentrations of chlorogenic acid and found a significant lethal effect and the mortality increased with increasing chlorogenic acid concentration. Next, we measured the sublethal effect of chlorogenic acid at LC<sub>20</sub> on the growth and development of <i>M. separata</i> larvae. The durations of the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> instar were longer than those of the control group (prolonged by 0.8 and 0.6 days, respectively), and the 6<sup>th</sup> instar was shorter (by 1.1 days). The total survival rate, pupation rate, eclosion rate, sex ratio, and oviposition amount in the LC<sub>20</sub> chlorogenic acid-treated group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis of 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae fed various concentrations of chlorogenic acid revealed that several <i>MsCYP450</i> genes were significantly up-regulated, and this finding was further validated by qRT-PCR. In addition, various concentrations of chlorogenic acid and different treatment times significantly affected the enzyme activity of CYP450 in 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae. Importantly, dietary ingestion of dsMsCYP450 significantly reduced the mRNA level of <i>MsCYP450</i> genes and increased mortality in the presence of chlorogenic acid. Our results revealed that <i>MsCYP6B6</i>, <i>MsCYP321A7</i>, and <i>MsCYP6B7-like</i> play an essential role in the detoxification of chlorogenic acid by <i>M. separata</i>. This study provides evidence of control effect by botanical insecticide chlorogenic acid on <i>M. separata</i>, and potential detoxification mechanism mediated by P450 of botanical insecticide in arthropods.
