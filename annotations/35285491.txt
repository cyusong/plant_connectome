The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf veins bundle-sheath cells (BSCs)-a selective barrier to water and solutes entering the mesophyll-increase the leaf radial hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) by acidifying the xylem sap by their plasma membrane H+-ATPase,  AHA2. Based on this and on the BSCs' expression of phototropins PHOT1 and PHOT2, and the known blue light (BL)-induced Kleaf increase, we hypothesized that, resembling the guard cells, BL perception by the BSCs' phots activates its H+-ATPase, which, consequently, upregulates Kleaf. Indeed, under BL, the Kleaf of the knockout mutant lines phot1-5, phot2-1, phot1-5 phot2-1, and aha2-4 was lower than that of the wild-type (WT). BSC-only-directed complementation of phot1-5 or aha2-4 by PHOT1 or AHA2, respectively, restored the BL-induced Kleaf increase. BSC-specific silencing of PHOT1 or PHOT2 prevented such Kleaf increase. A xylem-fed kinase inhibitor (tyrphostin 9) replicated this also in WT plants. White light-ineffective in the phot1-5 mutant-acidified the xylem sap (relative to darkness) in WT and in the PHOT1-complemented phot1-5. These results, supported by BL increase of BSC protoplasts' water permeability and cytosolic pH and their hyperpolarization by BL, identify the BSCs as a second phot-controlled water conductance element in leaves, in series with stomatal conductance. Through both, BL regulates the leaf water balance.
