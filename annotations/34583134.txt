Potassium is a major cationic nutrient involved in numerous physiological processes in plants. The uptake of K<sup>+</sup> is mediated by K<sup>+</sup> channels and transporters, and the Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel gene family plays an essential role in K<sup>+</sup> uptake and stress resistance in plants. However, little is known regarding this family in soybean. In this study, 14 members of the Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel gene family were identified in soybean and were classified into five groups. Protein domain analysis revealed that Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel gene members have an ion transport domain (ion trans), a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, ankyrin repeat domains, and a dimerization domain in the potassium ion channel. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the expression of eight genes (notably GmAKT1) in soybean leaves and roots was significantly increased in response to salt and drought stress. Furthermore, the overexpression of GmAKT1 in Arabidopsis enhanced root length, K<sup>+</sup> concentration, and fresh/dry weight ratio compared with wild-type plants subjected to salt and drought stress; this suggests that GmAKT1 improves the tolerance of soybean to abiotic stress. Our results provide important insight into the characterization of Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channel gene family members in soybean and highlight the function of GmAKT1 in soybean plants under salt and drought stress.
