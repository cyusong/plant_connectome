Although widely used in ecology, trait-based approaches are seldom used to study agroecosystems. In particular, there is a need to evaluate how functional trait variability among varieties of a crop species compares to the variability among wild plant species and how variety selection can modify trait syndromes. Here, we quantified 18 above- and below-ground functional traits for 57 varieties of common wheat representative of different modern selection histories. We compared trait variability among varieties and among Pooideae species, and analyzed the effect of selection histories on trait values and trait syndromes. For traits under strong selection, trait variability among varieties was less than 10% of the variability observed among Pooideae species. However, for traits not directly selected, such as root N uptake capacity, the variability was up to 75% of the variability among Pooideae species. Ammonium absorption capacity by roots was counter-selected for conventional varieties compared with organic varieties and landraces. Artificial selection also altered some trait syndromes classically reported for Pooideae. Identifying traits that have high or low variability among varieties and characterizing the hidden effects of selection on trait values and syndromes will benefit the selection of varieties to be used especially for lower N input agroecosystems.
