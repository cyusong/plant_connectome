['18796636', "Parental imprinting is important for seed development, but few imprinted genes  have been identified in plants. The four known imprinted genes in Arabidopsis  thaliana encode transcriptional regulators. Here, we describe a novel imprinted  gene, MATERNALLY EXPRESSED PAB C-TERMINAL (MPC), which encodes the C-terminal  domain of poly(A) binding proteins (PABPs). PABPs play roles in mRNA stability  and translation. MPC interacts with proteins that also interact with the  C-terminal domain of typical PABPs, suggesting that MPC may regulate translation  by modulating PABP activity. In the endosperm, MPC is expressed only from the  maternal allele. Reduction of MPC expression affects seed development. In dna  methyltransferase1 (met1) mutants, MPC is ectopically expressed, and the paternal  allele is active in the endosperm. CGs in the 5' flanking region and gene body of  MPC lose methylation in a met1 background. Both regions are required to confer  imprinted reporter expression, suggesting that the gene body contains imprinting  control region elements. In Arabidopsis, DEMETER (DME) activates expression of  maternal alleles. MPC expression is reduced in flowers and seeds in a dme-4  mutant but only after fertilization in dme-1. We conclude that other factors  along with DME promote MPC expression and that DME has indirect effects on  imprinted gene expression in endosperm.", '2008 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.061929', 'Scott']
