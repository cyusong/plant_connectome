['32737163', 'Xyloglucan (XyG) is an abundant component of the primary cell walls of most  plants. While the structure of XyG has been well studied, much remains to be  learned about its biosynthesis. Here we employed reverse genetics to investigate  the role of Arabidopsis cellulose synthase like-C (CSLC) proteins in XyG  biosynthesis. We found that single mutants containing a T-DNA in each of the five  Arabidopsis CSLC genes had normal levels of XyG. However, higher-order cslc  mutants had significantly reduced XyG levels, and a mutant with disruptions in  all five CSLC genes had no detectable XyG. The higher-order mutants grew with  mild tissue-specific phenotypes. Despite the apparent lack of XyG, the cslc  quintuple mutant did not display significant alteration of gene expression at the  whole-genome level, excluding transcriptional compensation. The quintuple mutant  could be complemented by each of the five CSLC genes, supporting the conclusion  that each of them encodes a XyG glucan synthase. Phylogenetic analyses indicated  that the CSLC genes are widespread in the plant kingdom and evolved from an  ancient family. These results establish the role of the CSLC genes in XyG  biosynthesis, and the mutants described here provide valuable tools with which to  study both the molecular details of XyG biosynthesis and the role of XyG in plant  cell wall structure and function.', '2020 Aug 18', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.2007245117', 'ORCID:']
