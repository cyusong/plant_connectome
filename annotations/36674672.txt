The commercial application of genetically modified plants has been seriously impeded by public concern surrounding the potential risks posed by such plants to the ecosystem and human health. Previously, we have developed a 'pollen- and seed-specific Gene Deletor' system that automatically excised all transgenes from the pollen and seeds of greenhouse-grown transgenic <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>. In this study, we conducted seven field experiments over three consecutive years to evaluate the stability of transgene excision under field conditions. Our results showed that transgenes were stably excised from transgenic <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> under field conditions with 100% efficiency. The stability of transgene excision was confirmed based on PCR, as well as the GUS staining patterns of various organs (roots, leaves, petiole, stem, flower, fruit, and seeds) from transgenic <i>N. tabacum</i>. In six transgenic lines (D4, D10, D31, D56, and D43), the transgenes were stably deleted in the T0 and T1 generations. Thus, the 'Gene Deletor' system is an efficient and reliable method to reduce pollen- and seed-mediated unintentional gene flow. This system might help to alleviate the food safety concerns associated with transgenic crops.
