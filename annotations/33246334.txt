Iron is one of the most important micronutrients for plant growth and development. It functions as the enzyme cofactor or component of electron transport chains in various vital metabolic processes, including photosynthesis, respiration, and amino acid biosynthesis. To maintain iron homeostasis, and therefore prevent any deficiency or excess that could be detrimental, plants have evolved complex transcriptional regulatory networks to tightly control iron uptake, translocation, assimilation, and storage. These regulatory networks are composed of various transcription factors; among them, members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family play an essential role. Here, we first review recent advances in understanding the roles of bHLH transcription factors involved in the regulatory cascade controlling iron homeostasis in the model plant Arabidopsis, and extend this understanding to rice and other plant species. The importance of other classes of transcription factors will also be discussed. Second, we elaborate on the post-translational mechanisms involved in the regulation of these regulatory networks. Finally, we provide some perspectives on future research that should be conducted in order to precisely understand how plants control the homeostasis of this micronutrient.
