Some of the most devastating oomycete pathogens deploy effector proteins, with the signature amino acid motif RXLR, that enter plant cells to promote virulence. Research on the function and evolution of RXLR effectors has been very active over the decade that has transpired since their discovery. Comparative genomics indicate that RXLR genes play a major role in virulence for Phytophthora and downy mildew species. Importantly, gene-for-gene resistance against these oomycete lineages is based on recognition of RXLR proteins. Comparative genomics have revealed several mechanisms through which this resistance can be broken, most notably involving epigenetic control of RXLR gene expression. Structural studies have revealed a core fold that is present in the majority of RXLR proteins, providing a foundation for detailed mechanistic understanding of virulence and avirulence functions. Finally, functional studies have demonstrated that suppression of host immunity is a major function for RXLR proteins. Host protein targets are being identified in a variety of plant cell compartments. Some targets comprise hubs that are also manipulated by bacteria and fungi, thereby revealing key points of vulnerability in the plant immune network.
