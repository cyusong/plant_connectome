['33308168', "BACKGROUND: The 29-member Arabidopsis AHL gene family is classified into three  main classes based on nucleotide and protein sequence evolutionary differences.  These differences include the presence or absence of introns, type and/or number  of conserved AT-hook and PPC domains. AHL gene family members are divided into  two phylogenetic clades, Clade-A and Clade-B. A majority of the 29 members remain  functionally uncharacterized. Furthermore, the biological significance of the DNA  and peptide sequence diversity, observed in the conserved motifs and domains  found in the different AHL types, is a subject area that remains largely  unexplored. RESULTS: Transgenic plants overexpressing AtAHL20 flowered later than  the wild type under both short and long days. Transcript accumulation analyses  showed that 35S:AtAHL20 plants contained reduced FT, TSF, AGL8 and SPL3 mRNA  levels. Similarly, overexpression of AtAHL20's orthologue in Camelina sativa,  Arabidopsis' closely related Brassicaceae family member species, conferred a  late-flowering phenotype via suppression of CsFT expression. However,  overexpression of an aberrant AtAHL20 gene harboring a missense mutation in the  AT-hook domain's highly conserved R-G-R core motif abolished the late-flowering  phenotype. Data from targeted yeast-two-hybrid assays showed that AtAHL20  interacted with itself and several other Clade-A Type-I AHLs which have been  previously implicated in flowering-time regulation: AtAHL19, AtAHL22 and AtAHL29.  CONCLUSION: We showed via gain-of-function analysis that AtAHL20 is a negative  regulator of FT expression, as well as other downstream flowering time regulating  genes. A similar outcome in Camelina sativa transgenic plants overexpressing  CsAHL20 suggest that this is a conserved function. Our results demonstrate that  AtAHL20 acts as a photoperiod-independent negative regulator of transition to  flowering.", '2020 Dec 11', 'BMC Plant Biol', '10.1186/s12870-020-02733-5', 'Neff']
