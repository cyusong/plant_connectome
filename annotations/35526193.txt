Galactolipids are essential to compensate for the loss of phospholipids by 'membrane lipid remodelling' in plants under phosphorus (P) deficiency conditions. Monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG) synthases catalyse the synthesis of MGDG which is further converted into digalactosyl diacylglycerol (DGDG), later replacing phospholipids in the extraplastidial membranes. However, the roles of these enzymes are not well explored in rice. In this study, the rice MGDG synthase 3 gene (OsMGD3) was identified and functionally characterized. We showed that the plant phosphate (Pi) status and the transcription factor PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 2 (OsPHR2) are involved in the transcriptional regulation of OsMGD3. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and overexpression lines of OsMGD3 were generated to explore its potential role in rice adaptation to Pi deficiency. Compared with the wild type, OsMGD3 knockout lines displayed a reduced Pi acquisition and utilization while overexpression lines showed an enhancement of the same. Further, OsMGD3 showed a predominant role in roots, altering lateral root growth. Our comprehensive lipidomic analysis revealed a role of OsMGD3 in membrane lipid remodelling, in addition to a role in regulating diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid contents that affected the expression of Pi transporters. Our study highlights the role of OsMGD3 in affecting both internal P utilization and P acquisition in rice.
