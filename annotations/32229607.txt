The Antarctic green alga <i>Chlamydomonas</i> sp. UWO 241 (UWO 241) is adapted to permanent low temperatures, hypersalinity, and extreme shade. One of the most striking phenotypes of UWO 241 is an altered PSI organization and constitutive PSI cyclic electron flow (CEF). To date, little attention has been paid to CEF during long-term stress acclimation, and the consequences of sustained CEF in UWO 241 are not known. In this study, we combined photobiology, proteomics, and metabolomics to understand the underlying role of sustained CEF in high-salinity stress acclimation. High salt-grown UWO 241 exhibited increased thylakoid proton motive flux and an increased capacity for nonphotochemical quenching. Under high salt, a significant proportion of the up-regulated enzymes were associated with the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, carbon storage metabolism, and protein translation. Two key enzymes of the shikimate pathway, 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase and chorismate synthase, were also up-regulated, as well as indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of l-Trp and indole acetic acid. In addition, several compatible solutes (glycerol, Pro, and Suc) accumulated to high levels in high salt-grown UWO 241 cultures. We suggest that UWO 241 maintains constitutively high CEF through the associated PSI-cytochrome <i>b</i> <sub>6</sub> <i>f</i> supercomplex to support robust growth and strong photosynthetic capacity under a constant growth regime of low temperatures and high salinity.
