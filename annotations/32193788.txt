Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important in regulating plant development as well as stress response. In this study, we genome-widely identified 56 MAPK genes in upland cotton. These MAPK genes unequally distribute on 22 chromosomes of cotton genome, but no MAPK gene is located on At_Chr6, Dt_Chr6, At_Chr13 and Dt_Chr13. The exons and introns in GhMAPK gene family vary widely at the position, number and length. Furthermore, GhMAPK family can be divided into 4 groups (A, B, C and D), and the TEY type of T-loop exists in three groups (A, B and C), but the TDY type of T-loop is only in group D. Further study revealed that some GhMAPK genes (including GhMPK6) are preferentially expressed in elongating fibers. GhMPK6 maintains a high phosphorylation level in elongating fibers, and its phosphorylation was enhanced in fibers by phytohormones brassinosteroid (BR), ethylene and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Additionally, GhMPK6 could interact with GhMKK2-2 and GhMKK4, suggesting that GhMKK2-2/4-GhMPK6 module may be involved in phosphorylation of its downstream proteins for regulating fiber elongation of cotton.
