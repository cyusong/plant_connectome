A flower is an essential organ for sexual reproduction in flowering plants, which has been extensively studied in model plants. In this study, we used transcriptomic, small RNA and degradome analyses to characterize key microRNAs (miRNAs) and their targets in floral organs of moso bamboo. In total, we identified 13,051 differentially expressed genes and 109 known miRNAs from 26 miRNA families. We aligned the miRNAs to known miRNA databases and revealed some conserved as well as novel miRNAs. Sixteen conserved miRNAs were specifically and highly expressed in stamens, including miRNA159 and miRNA166. In situ hybridization shows that miRNA159 plays a key role in the regulation of stamen development, and the expression levels of its targets PheMYB98 and PheMYB42 were low. Furthermore, Phe-MIRNA159 partially recovers phenotypes of mir159ab double mutant. Overexpression of Phe-MIR159 could cause failure in anther dehisce, and the mature pollens could not be dispersed and further reduce fertility in Arabidopsis. Semi-thin section result shows that anther endothelial layer of Phe-MIRNA159 overexpressing lines is lack of secondary thickening, resulting in limited force for anther opening. Phe-miR159 may regulate the expression of genes related to secondary thickening through negative regulation of AtMYB33, affecting the anther dehiscence. Taken together, this study provides insights regarding molecular networks underlying floral organs development of moso bamboo.
