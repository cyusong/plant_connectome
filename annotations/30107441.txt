In the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH; EC 1.1.1.44) is one of the enzymes that catalyzes reactions generating NADPH. The model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is widely studied for numerous applications; however, biochemical knowledge of the NADPH production pathway in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is limited. In this study, we conducted biochemical analysis of a 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Sy6PGDH). We found that Sy6PGDH has unconventional characteristics, i.e. the highest kcat value and non-competitive inhibition by NADPH. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of cyanobacterial 6PGDHs revealed that an amino acid residue at position 42 in Sy6PGDH is highly conserved for each order of cyanobacteria, but Sy6PGDH is phylogenetically unique. In Sy6PGDH, a single amino acid substitution at position 42 from serine to threonine enhanced the affinity for NADP+ and altered the mode of inhibition by NADPH. The amino acid substitution equivalent to Ser42 also altered the affinity for NADP+ and mode of inhibition by NADPH in Arthrospira platensis. These data suggested that an amino acid residue corresponding to position 42 in Sy6PGDH is one of the important residues that possibly determines the function of cyanobacterial 6PGDHs.
