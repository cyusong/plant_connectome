['14996837', 'The yeast and human mitochondrial sulfhydryl oxidases of the Erv1/Alr family have  been shown to be essential for the biogenesis of mitochondria and the cytosolic  iron sulfur cluster assembly. In this study we identified a likely candidate for  the first mitochondrial flavin-linked sulfhydryl oxidase of the Erv1-type from a  photosynthetic organism. The central core of the plant enzyme (AtErv1) exhibits  all of the characteristic features of the Erv1/Alr protein family, including a  redox-active YPCXXC motif, noncovalently bound FAD, and sulfhydryl oxidase  activity. Transient expression of fusion proteins of AtErv1 and the green  fluorescence protein in plant protoplasts showed that the plant enzyme  preferentially localizes to the mitochondria. Yet AtErv1 has several unique  features, such as the presence of a CXXXXC motif in its carboxyl-terminal domain  and the absence of an amino-terminally localized cysteine pair common to yeast  and human Erv1/Alr proteins. In addition, the dimerization of AtErv1 is not  mediated by its amino terminus but by its unique CXXXXC motif. In vitro assays  with purified protein and artificial substrates demonstrate a preference of  AtErv1 for dithiols with a defined space between the thiol groups, suggesting a  thioredoxin-like substrate.', '2004 May 7', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M312877200', 'Lisowsky']
