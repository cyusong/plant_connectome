['30301773', 'Maintaining the appropriate number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules is  crucial for supporting mitochondrial metabolism and function in both plant and  animal cells. For example, a substantial decrease in mtDNA levels occurs as a key  part of pollen development. The molecular mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number  are largely unclear, particularly with regard to those that reduce mtDNA levels.  Here, we identified and purified a 20-kD endonuclease, M20, from maize (Zea mays)  pollen mitochondria. We found M20 to be an His-Asn-His/Asn (H-N-H/N) nuclease  that degrades linear and circular DNA in the presence of Mg(2+) or Mn(2+)  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AtM20, which shared high sequence similarity  with maize M20, localized to the mitochondria, had a similar H-N-H/N structure,  and degraded both linear and circular DNA. AtM20 transcript levels increased  during pollen development, in parallel with a rapid reduction in mtDNA. Clustered  regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated  protein 9 genome-editing techniques were used to generate knockout lines of AtM20  (atm20), which exhibited a significant delay in the reduction in mtDNA levels in  pollen vegetative cells but normal mtDNA levels in somatic cells. The delayed  reduction in pollen mtDNA levels was rescued by the transgenic expression of  AtM20 in atm20 plants. This study thus uncovers an endonucleolytic DNase in plant  mitochondria and its crucial role in reducing mtDNA levels, pointing to the  complex mechanism regulating mtDNA levels in plants.', '2018 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.18.00754', 'ORCID:']
