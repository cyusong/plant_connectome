['21798377', 'Pollen grains play important roles in the reproductive processes of flowering  plants. The roles of apoplastic proteins in pollen germination and in pollen tube  growth are comparatively less well understood. To investigate the functions of  apoplastic proteins in pollen germination, the global apoplastic proteins of  mature and germinated Arabidopsis thaliana pollen grains were prepared for  differential analyses by using 2-dimensional fluorescence difference gel  electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) saturation labeling techniques. One hundred and three  proteins differentially expressed (p value</=0.01) in pollen germinated for 6h  compared with un-germination mature pollen, and 98 spots, which represented 71  proteins, were identified by LC-MS/MS. By bioinformatics analysis, 50 proteins  were identified as secreted proteins. These proteins were mainly involved in cell  wall modification and remodeling, protein metabolism and signal transduction.  Three of the differentially expressed proteins were randomly selected to  determine their subcellular localizations by transiently expressing YFP fusion  proteins. The results of subcellular localization were identical with the  bioinformatics prediction. Based on these data, we proposed a model for  apoplastic proteins functioning in pollen germination and pollen tube growth.  These results will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of pollen  germination and pollen tube growth.', '2011 Dec', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbapap.2011.07.013', 'Guo']
