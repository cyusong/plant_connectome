Lead (Pb) is a highly toxic contaminant to living organisms and the environment. Excessive Pb in soils affects crop yield and quality, thus threatening human health <i>via</i> the food chain. Herein, we investigated Pb tolerance among a maize association panel using root bushiness (BSH) under Pb treatment as an indicator. Through a genome-wide association study of relative BSH, we identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 30 candidate genes associated with Pb tolerance in maize seedlings. Transcriptome analysis showed that four of the 30 genes were differentially responsive to Pb treatment between two maize lines with contrasting Pb tolerance. Among these, the <i>ZmbZIP107</i> transcription factor was confirmed as the key gene controlling maize tolerance to Pb by using gene-based association studies. Two 5' UTR_variants in <i>ZmbZIP107</i> affected its expression level and Pb tolerance among different maize lines. ZmbZIP107 protein was specifically targeted to the nucleus and <i>ZmbZIP107</i> mRNA showed the highest expression in maize seedling roots among different tissues. Heterologous expression of <i>ZmbZIP107</i> enhanced rice tolerance to Pb stress and decreased Pb absorption in the roots. Our study provided the basis for revelation of the molecular mechanism underlying Pb tolerance and contributed to cultivation of Pb-tolerant varieties in maize.
