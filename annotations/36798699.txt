tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) represent a novel category of small non-coding RNAs and serve as a new regulator of gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Growing evidence indicates that tsRNAs can be induced by diverse stimuli and regulate stress-responsive target genes, allowing plants to adapt to unfavorable environments. Here, we discuss the latest developments about the biogenesis and classification of tsRNAs and highlight the expression regulation and potential function of tsRNAs in plant biotic and abiotic stress responses. Of note, we also collect useful bioinformatics tools and resources for tsRNAs study in plants. Finally, we propose current limitations and future directions for plant tsRNAs research. These recent discoveries have refined our understanding of whether and how tsRNAs enhance plant stress tolerance.
