['16677815', 'In plants, auxin is a key regulator of development and is unique among plant  hormones in that its function requires polarized transport between neighboring  cells to form concentration gradients across various plant tissues. Although  putative auxin-influx and -efflux transporters have been identified by using  molecular genetic approaches, a detailed functional understanding for many of  these transporters remains undetermined. Here we present the functional  characterization of the auxin-influx carrier AUX1. Upon expression of AUX1 in  Xenopus oocytes, saturable, pH-dependent uptake of 3H-IAA was measured. Mutations  in AUX1 that abrogate physiological responses to IAA in planta resulted in loss  or reduction of 3H-IAA uptake in AUX1-expressing oocytes. AUX1-mediated uptake of  3H-IAA was reduced by the IAA analogs 2,4-D and 1-NOA, but not by other auxin  analogs. The measured Km for AUX1-mediated uptake of 3H-IAA was at concentrations  at which physiological responses are observed for exogenously added IAA and  2,4-D. This is the first report demonstrating detailed functional characteristics  of a plant auxin-influx transporter. This biochemical characterization provides  new insights and a novel tool for studying auxin entry into cells and its pivotal  roles in plant growth and development.', '2006 Jun 6', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2006.04.029', 'Nielsen']
