The halotolerant green alga Dunaliella tertiolecta accumulates starch and triacylglycerol (TAG) amounting to 70% and 10-15% of total cellular carbon, respectively, when exposed to nitrogen (N) deprivation. The purpose of this study was to clarify the inter-relationships between the biosynthesis of TAG, starch, and polar lipids (PLs) in this alga. Pulse labeling with [14C]bicarbonate was utilized to label starch and [14C]palmitic acid (PlA) to label lipids. Transfer of 14C into TAG was measured and used to calculate rates of synthesis. About two-thirds of the carbon in TAG originates from starch, and one-third is made de novo by direct CO2 assimilation. The level made from degradation of pre-formed PLs is estimated to be very small. Most of the de novo synthesis involves fatty acid transfer through PLs made during the first day of N deprivation. The results suggest that starch made by photosynthetic carbon assimilation at the early stages of N deprivation is utilized for synthesis of TAG. Trans-acylation from PLs is the second major contributor to TAG biosynthesis. The utilization of starch for TAG biosynthesis may have biotechnological applications to optimize TAG biosynthesis in algae.
