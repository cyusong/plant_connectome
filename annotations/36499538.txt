<i>ICE1</i>, a regulator of the cold-inducible transcriptome and freezing tolerance, is currently widely believed to be involved in plant resistance to cold stress. In this study, <i>CfICE1</i> from <i>Cryptomeria fortunei</i> was transformed into poplar. Physiological indicators of transgenic, empty vector and wild-type poplar after abiotic stress (cold, drought and salt) were determined. Transgenic lines had a higher chlorophyll content, antioxidant enzyme activity and soluble protein content, as well as a lower malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide content. The ultrastructure of the plant was observed by transmission electron microscopy, and after stress, the cell structure of the transgenic line was more complete than that of the wild type. <i>CfICE1</i> was upregulated in transgenic poplar trees after abiotic stress (cold, drought and salt). The <i>CfICE1</i> transgenic plants improved plant resistance by regulating the <i>CBF</i> gene of poplar under cold and salt stress. In terms of plant responses to abiotic stress, this study showed that overexpression of <i>CfICE1</i> improved the cold, drought and salt tolerance of poplars.
