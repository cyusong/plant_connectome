Lipid droplets called plastoglobules (PGs) exist in most plant tissues and plastid types. In chloroplasts, the polar lipid monolayer surrounding these low-density lipoprotein particles is continuous with the outer lipid leaflet of the thylakoid membrane. Often small clusters of two or three PGs, only one of them directly connected to thylakoids, are present. Structural proteins (known as plastid-lipid associated proteins/fibrillins or plastoglobulins) together with lipid metabolic enzymes coat the PGs. The hydrophobic core of PGs contains a range of neutral lipids including the prenylquinones [tocopherols (vitamin E), phylloquinone (vitamin K(1)), and plastoquinone (PQ-9)]. In this review the function of PGs and their associated enzymes in prenylquinone metabolism will be discussed.
