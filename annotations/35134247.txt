Tools for sequence-specific DNA binding have opened the door to new approaches in investigating fundamental questions in biology and crop development. While there are several platforms to choose from, many of the recent advances in sequence-specific targeting tools are focused on developing Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats- CRISPR Associated (CRISPR-Cas)-based systems. Using a catalytically inactive Cas protein (dCas), this system can act as a vector for different modular catalytic domains (effector domains) to control a gene's expression or alter epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation. Recent trends in developing CRISPR-dCas systems include creating versions that can target multiple copies of effector domains to a single site, targeting epigenetic changes that, in some cases, can be inherited to the next generation in the absence of the targeting construct, and combining effector domains and targeting strategies to create synergies that increase the functionality or efficiency of the system. This review summarizes and compares DNA targeting technologies, the effector domains used to target transcriptional control and epi-mutagenesis, and the different CRISPR-dCas systems used in plants.
