['28213560', 'Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into  chloroplasts. Many imported proteins are further targeted to the thylakoid  membrane and lumen by the SEC1, TAT, or SRP/ALB3 translocases. Others are  targeted to the inner chloroplast envelope membrane by undescribed translocases.  Recently, a second SEC system (SEC2) consisting of SCY2, SECE2, and SECA2 was  found in the chloroplast envelope. Null mutants of SCY2 in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) exhibit a severe embryo-lethal phenotype. To investigate  the function of the SEC2 system in plants, we used inducible RNA interference to  knock down SCY2 in Arabidopsis. Seedlings cultured with inducer were chlorotic  with aberrant chloroplasts and undeveloped thylakoids, indicating an essential  role for SCY2 in chloroplast biogenesis beyond embryo development. In SCY2  down-regulated seedlings, several thylakoid membrane proteins, including SCY1,  ALB3, and TATC, and inner envelope membrane proteins, including TIC40, TIC110,  and FTSH12, were reduced substantially, suggesting that they may be SEC2  substrates. Additional insight was achieved by the in vitro reconstitution of  protein integration into chloroplast membranes. The results show that SCY1 and  ALB3 target directly to the thylakoid membrane and are likely independent of  SEC2. FTSH12 was integrated into the envelope membrane in a coupled  import-integration reaction that was impaired by the SECA inhibitor sodium azide.  The stromal intermediate of TIC40 integrated into the envelope in a reaction that  was largely inhibited when antibodies against epitope-tagged SCY2 or SECE2 were  applied. These data demonstrate that the SEC2 translocase likely integrates a  subset of inner envelope membrane proteins, such as FTSH12 and TIC40.', '2017 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.00012', 'ORCID:']
