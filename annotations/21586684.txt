Understanding the regulation of key genes involved in plant iron acquisition is of crucial importance for breeding of micronutrient-enriched crops. The basic helix-loop-helix protein FER-LIKE FE DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT), a central regulator of Fe acquisition in roots, is regulated by environmental cues and internal requirements for iron at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The plant stress hormone ethylene promotes iron acquisition, but the molecular basis for this remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate a direct molecular link between ethylene signaling and FIT. We identified ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 (EIL1) in a screen for direct FIT interaction partners and validated their physical interaction in planta. We demonstrate that the ein3 eil1 transcriptome was affected to a greater extent upon iron deficiency than normal iron compared with the wild type. Ethylene signaling by way of EIN3/EIL1 was required for full-level FIT accumulation. FIT levels were reduced upon application of aminoethoxyvinylglycine and in the ein3 eil1 background. MG132 could restore FIT levels. We propose that upon ethylene signaling, FIT is less susceptible to proteasomal degradation, presumably due to a physical interaction between FIT and EIN3/EIL1. Increased FIT abundance then leads to the high level of expression of genes required for Fe acquisition. This way, ethylene is one of the signals that triggers Fe deficiency responses at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.
