Resistance (R) gene-mediated resistance is a robust and efficient antiviral immune system in the plants. Thus, when R-mediated resistance was suppressed at elevated temperatures, resistance towards viruses was expected to be completely collapsed. Nonetheless, the multiplication of Tobacco mosaic virus pathotype P0 (TMV-P0) was inhibited, and TMV-P0 particles were only occasionally present in the systemic leaves of pepper plants (Capsicum annuum). RNAi-mediated RNA silencing is a well-known antiviral immune mechanism. At elevated temperatures, RNAi-mediated antiviral resistance was induced and virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs) were dramatically increased. Through sRNA-sequencing (sRNA-Seq) analysis, we revealed that vsiRNAs derived from TMV-P0 were greatly increased. Intriguingly, virus-infected plants could select the temperature-specific vsiRNAs for antiviral resistance from the amplified vsiRNAs at elevated temperatures. Pre-application of these temperature-specific vsiRNAs endowed antiviral resistance of the plants. Therefore, plants sustain antiviral resistance by activating RNAi-mediated resistance, based on temperature-specific vsiRNAs at elevated temperatures.
