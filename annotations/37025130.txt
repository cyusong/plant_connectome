To explore specific components of resistance against the tomato-adapted powdery mildew pathogen <i>Pseudoidium neolycopersici</i> (<i>On</i>) in the model plant Arabidopsis, we performed a disease assay in 123 accessions. When testing the resistance in the F<sub>1</sub> from crossings between resistant accessions with susceptible Col-0 or Sha, only the progeny of the cross between accession Bla-6 and Col-0 displayed a completely resistant phenotype. The resistance in Bla-6 is known to be specific for <i>Pseudoidium neolycopersici</i>. QTL analysis and fine-mapping through several rounds of recombinant screenings allowed us to locate a major resistance QTL in an interval on chromosome 1, containing two candidate genes and an intergenic insertion. <i>Via</i> CRISPR/Cas9 targeted mutagenesis, we could show that knocking out the <i>ZED-1 RELATED KINASE 13</i> (<i>ZRK13</i>) gene compromised the <i>On</i> resistance in Bla-6. Several polymorphisms are observed in the ZRK13 allelic variant of Bla-6 when compared to the Col-0 protein.
