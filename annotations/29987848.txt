Lignocelluloses are abundant raw materials for production of fuels, chemicals and materials. The purpose of this paper is to review the enzyme-types and enzyme-technologies studied and applied in the processing of the lignocelluloses into different products. The enzymes here are mostly glycoside hydrolases, esterases and different redox enzymes. Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic polysaccharides to platform sugars has been widely studied leading to development of advanced commercial products for this purpose. Restricted hydrolysis or oxidation of cellulosic fibers have been applied in processing of pulps to paper products, nanocelluloses and textile fibers. Oxidation, transglycosylation and derivatization have been utilized in functionalization of fibers, cellulosic surfaces and polysaccharides. Enzymatic polymerization, depolymerization and grafting methods are being developed for lignin valorization.
