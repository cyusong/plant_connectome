The current agricultural system is biased for the yield increase at the cost of biodiversity. However, due to the loss of precious genetic diversity during domestication and artificial selection, modern cultivars have lost the adaptability to cope with unfavorable environments. There are many reports on variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels in the stress-tolerant gene alleles that are associated with higher stress tolerance in wild progenitors, natural accessions, and extremophiles in comparison with domesticated crops or model plants. Therefore, to gain a better understanding of stress-tolerant traits in naturally stress-resistant plants, more comparative studies between the modern crops/model plants and crop progenitors/natural accessions/extremophiles are required. In this review, we discussed and summarized recent progress on natural variations associated with enhanced abiotic stress tolerance in various plants. By applying the recent biotechniques such as the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool, natural genetic resources (i.e., stress-tolerant gene alleles) from diverse plants could be introduced to the modern crop in a non-genetically modified way to improve stress-tolerant traits.
