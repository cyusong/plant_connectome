['19854131', 'Orthologs of the yeast telomere protein Stn1 are present in plants, but other  components of the Cdc13/Stn1/Ten1 (CST) complex have only been found in fungi.  Here we report the identification of conserved telomere maintenance component 1  (CTC1) in plants and vertebrates. CTC1 encodes an approximately 140 kDa  telomere-associated protein predicted to contain multiple OB-fold domains.  Arabidopsis mutants null for CTC1 display a severe telomere deprotection  phenotype accompanied by a rapid onset of developmental defects and sterility.  Telomeric and subtelomeric tracts are dramatically eroded, and chromosome ends  exhibit increased G overhangs, recombination, and end-to-end fusions. AtCTC1 both  physically and genetically interacts with AtSTN1. Depletion of human CTC1 by RNAi  triggers a DNA damage response, chromatin bridges, increased G overhangs, and  sporadic telomere loss. These data indicate that CTC1 participates in telomere  maintenance in diverse species and that a CST-like complex is required for  telomere integrity in multicellular organisms.', '2009 Oct 23', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/j.molcel.2009.09.017', 'Shippen']
