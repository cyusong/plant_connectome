Low temperature is one of the major factors that adversely affect crop yields by causing restraints on plant growth and productivity. However, most temperate plants have the ability to acclimate to cooler temperatures. Cold acclimation is a process which increases the freezing tolerance of an organism after exposure to low, non-freezing temperatures. The main trigger is a decrease in temperature levels, but light reduction has also been shown to have an important impact on acquired tolerance. Since the lowest temperatures are commonly reached during the night hours in winter time and is an annually recurring event, a favorable trait for plants is the possibility of sensing an imminent cold period. Consequently, extensive crosstalk between light- and temperature signaling pathways has been demonstrated and in this review interesting interaction points that have been previously reported in the literature are highlighted.
