We proposed a working model of BR to promote leaf size through cell expansion. In the BR signaling pathway, GhBES1 affects cotton leaf size by binding to and activating the expression of the E-box element in the GhEXO2 promoter region. Brassinosteroid (BR) is an essential phytohormone that controls plant growth. However, the mechanisms of BR regulation of leaf size remain to be determined. Here, we found that the BR deficient cotton mutant pagoda1 (pag1) had a smaller leaf size than wild-type CRI24. The expression of EXORDIUM (GhEXO2) gene, was significantly downregulated in pag1. Silencing of BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (GhBES1), inhibited leaf cell expansion and reduced leaf size. Overexpression of GhBES1.4 promoted leaf cell expansion and enlarged leaf size. Expression analysis showed GhEXO2 expression positively correlated with GhBES1 expression. In plants, altered expression of GhEXO2 promoted leaf cell expansion affecting leaf size. Furthermore, GhBES1.4 specifically binds to the E-box elements in the GhEXO2 promoter, inducing its expression. RNA-seq data revealed many down-regulated genes related to cell expansion in GhEXO2 silenced plants. In summary, we discovered a novel mechanism of BR regulation of leaf size through GhBES1 directly activating the expression of GhEXO2.
