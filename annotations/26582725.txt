Diatoms often inhabit highly variable habitats where they are confronted with a wide variety of stresses, frequently including starvation of nutrients such as nitrogen. In this study, the transcriptome of the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum was profiled during the onset of nitrogen starvation by RNA sequencing, and overrepresented motifs were determined in promoters of genes that were early and strongly up-regulated during the nitrogen stress response. One of these motifs could be bound by a nitrogen starvation-inducible RING-domain protein termed RING-GAF-Gln-containing protein (RGQ1), which was shown to act as a transcription factor and belongs to a previously uncharacterized family that is conserved in heterokont algae.
