['28743909', 'A great proportion of nitrate taken up by plants is stored in vacuoles. Vacuolar  nitrate accumulation and release is of great importance to nitrate reallocation  and efficient utilization. However, how plants mediate nitrate efflux from  vacuoles to cytoplasm is largely unknown. The current study identified NPF5.11,  NPF5.12 and NPF5.16 as vacuolar nitrate efflux transporters in Arabidopsis.  Histochemical analysis showed that NPF5.11, NPF5.12 and NPF5.16 were expressed  preferentially in root pericycle cells and xylem parenchyma cells, and further  analysis showed that these proteins were tonoplast-localized. Functional  characterization using cRNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that NPF5.11,  NPF5.12 and NPF5.16 were low-affinity, pH-dependent nitrate uptake transporters.  In npf5.11 npf5.12 npf5.16 triple mutant lines, more root-fed (15)NO(3)(-) was  translocated to shoots compared to the wild type control. In the NPF5.12  overexpression lines, proportionally less nitrate was maintained in roots. These  data together suggested that NPF5.11, NPF5.12 and NPF5.16 might function to  uptake nitrate from vacuoles into cytosol, thus serving as important players to  modulate nitrate allocation between roots and shoots.', '2017 Jul 25', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/s41598-017-06744-5', 'ORCID:']
