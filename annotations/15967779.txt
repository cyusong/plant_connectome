Five cold temperature germinating (ctg) mutants, completing germination at 10 degrees C faster than wild type, have been recovered from activation-tagged populations of Arabidopsis thaliana. Three (ctg10-D, 41-D, and 144-D) were tagged and segregated 3:1 for BASTA resistance in the F2 when crossed with wild type. None of the tagged ctg mutants was disturbed in sensitivity to abscisic acid or glucose but all were less sensitive to GA4+7 and osmoticum. The other two mutants (ctg156 and ctg225) were recessive, BASTA sensitive, and exhibited a transparent testa (tt) phenotype. They were more sensitive to abscisic acid, paclobutrazol, and GA4+7 than wild type but had similar sensitivity to osmoticum. Dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde staining of seeds from the two tt mutants, compared with stained seeds from the publicly available tt lines 1-10, suggested that ctg156 was a new allele of tt1, while ctg225 was similar to tt7-1. However, reciprocal crosses determined that ctg156 was not allelic to tt1 while ctg225 was a new allele of tt7. When the gene was sequenced from ctg225 it was missing 10 bp in the second exon, resulting in the incorporation of two spurious amino acids (G282E and D283A) followed by a stop. The screen successfully recovered mutants completing germination faster than wild type at 10 degrees C.
