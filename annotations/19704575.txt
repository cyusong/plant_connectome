The plant response to low levels of oxygen involves an interplay of transcriptional, translational and post-translational signaling. However, in plants, the sensing mechanism itself remains obscure. The role of nitric oxide (NO) in oxygen sensing and balancing has been extensively explored in our laboratory. We suggest that NO is generated within the mitochondria from nitrite in response to hypoxia, and that this small gaseous molecule can reversibly modify both the respiratory oxygen consumption and the oxygen availability within the seed. We further propose that hemoglobins play a central role in the detoxification of excess NO.
