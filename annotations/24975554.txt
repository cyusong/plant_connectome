To date, only a limited number of solanaceous miRNAs have been deposited in the miRNA database. Here, genome-wide bioinformatic identification of miRNAs was performed in six solanaceous plants (potato, tomato, tobacco, eggplant, pepper, and petunia). A total of 2,239 miRNAs were identified following a range of criteria, of which 982 were from potato, 496 from tomato, 655 from tobacco, 46 from eggplant, 45 were from pepper, and 15 from petunia. The sizes of miRNA families and miRNA precursor length differ in all the species. Accordingly, 620 targets were predicted, which could be functionally classified as transcription factors, metabolic enzymes, RNA and protein processing proteins, and other proteins for plant growth and development. We also showed evidence for miRNA clusters and sense and antisense miRNAs. Additionally, five Pi starvation- and one arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM)-related cis-elements were found widely distributed in the putative promoter regions of the miRNA genes. Selected miRNAs were classified into three groups based on the presence or absence of P1BS and MYCS cis-elements, and their expression in response to Pi starvation and AM symbiosis was validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). These results show that conserved miRNAs exist in solanaceous species and they might play pivotal roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses.
