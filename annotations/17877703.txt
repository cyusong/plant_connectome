['17877703', 'In genetic hybrids displaying nucleolar dominance, acetylation of lysines 5, 8,  12 and 16 of histone H4 (H4K5, H4K8, H4K12, H4K16) and acetylation of histone H3  on lysines 9 and 14 (H3K9, H3K14) occurs at the promoters of active ribosomal RNA  (rRNA) genes, whereas silenced rRNA genes are deacetylated. Likewise, histone  hyperacetylation correlates with the active state of transgenes and of endogenous  plant genes involved in physiological processes, including cold tolerance,  light-responsiveness and flowering. To investigate histone hyperacetylation  dynamics we used sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor known to switch  silent rRNA genes on, in order to enrich the pool of acetylated histones. Mass  spectrometric analyses revealed unique mono- (K16Ac), di- (K12Ac, K16Ac), tri-  (K8Ac, K12Ac, K16Ac), and tetra-acetylated (K5Ac, K8Ac, K12Ac, K16Ac) histone H4  isoforms, suggesting that H4 hyperacetylation occurs in a processive fashion,  beginning with lysine 16 and ending with lysine 5. Using a combination of  molecular and mass spectrometric assays we then determined the specificities of  seven of the nine functional co-activator type histone acetyltransferases (HATs)  in Arabidopsis thaliana: specifically HATs of the CBP (HAC1, HAC5, HAC12), GNAT  (HAG1, HAG2), and MYST families (HAM1, HAM2). Specific HATs acetylate histone  H4K5 (HAM1, HAM2), H4K12 (HAG2), and H3K14 (HAG1), suggesting that acetylation of  these lysines may have special regulatory significance. Other acetylation events,  including histone H3K9 acetylation, are likely to result from the activities of  the broad-specificity HAC1, HAC5, and HAC12 histone acetyltransferases.', '2007 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03264.x', 'Pikaard']
