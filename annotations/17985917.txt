['17985917', 'We establish by heterologous expression that the Arabidopsis thaliana  oxidosqualene cyclase At1g78955 (CAMS1) makes camelliol C (98%), achilleol A  (2%), and beta-amyrin (0.2%). CAMS1 is the first characterized cyclase that  generates predominantly a monocyclic triterpene alcohol. Phylogenetic analysis  shows that CAMS1 evolved from enzymes that make pentacycles, thus revealing that  its pentacyclic beta-amyrin byproduct is an evolutionary relic. Sequence  alignments support prior suggestions that decreased steric bulk at a key  active-site residue promotes monocycle formation.', '2007 Dec 6', 'Org Lett', '10.1021/ol702399g', 'Matsuda']
