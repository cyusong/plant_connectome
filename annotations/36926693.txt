Multiple enzymes perform moonlighting functions distinct from their main roles. UDP-glucose epimerases (UGEs), a subclass of isomerases, catalyze the interconversion of UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) and UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal). We identified a rice male-sterile mutant, osuge1, with delayed tapetum degradation and abortive pollen. The mutant osuge1 protein lacked UDP-glucose epimerase activity, resulting in higher UDP-Gal content and lower UDP-Glc levels in the osuge1 mutant compared to the wild type. Interestingly, we discovered that OsUGE1 participates in the TIP2/bHLH142-TDR-EAT1/DTD transcriptional regulatory cascade involved in tapetum degradation, in which TIP2 and TDR regulate OsUGE1 expression while OsUGE1 regulates EAT1 expression. In addition, we found that OsUGE1 regulates the expression of its own gene by directly binding to an E-box element in the OsUGE1 promoter. Collectively, our results indicate that OsUGE1 not only functions as an UDP-glucose epimerase but also moonlights a transcriptional activator to promote tapetum degradation, revealing a novel regulatory mechanism of rice reproductive development.
