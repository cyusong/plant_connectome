Innate immunity is generally initiated with recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are perceived by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to activation of a series of immune responses, including the expression of defense genes, ROS production and activation of MAP kinase. Recent progress has indicated that receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) are directly activated by ligand-activated PRRs and initiate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in both Arabidopsis and rice. To suppress PTI, pathogens inhibit the RLCKs by many types of effectors, including AvrAC, AvrPphB and Xoo1488. In this review, we summarize recent advances in RLCK-mediated PTI in plants.
