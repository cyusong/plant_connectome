Drought is one of the most deleterious environmental conditions affecting crop growth and productivity. Here we report the important roles of a nuclear-encoded chloroplast protein, PsbP Domain Protein 5 (PPD5), in drought resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). From a forward genetic screen, a drought-resistant mutant named <i>ppd5-2</i> was identified, which has a knockout mutation in <i>PPD5</i> The <i>ppd5</i> mutants showed increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in guard cells and enhanced stomatal closure in response to drought stress. Further analysis revealed that the chloroplast-localized PPD5 protein interacts with and is phosphorylated by OST1, and phosphorylation of PPD5 increases its protein stability. Double mutant <i>ppd5-2ost1-3</i> exhibited phenotypes resembling the <i>ost1-3</i> single mutant with decreased stomatal closure, increased water loss, reduced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in guard cells, and hypersensitivity to drought stress. These results indicate that the chloroplast protein PPD5 negatively regulates drought resistance by modulating guard cell H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation via an OST1-dependent pathway. Interestingly, the <i>thf1-1</i> mutant defective in the chloroplast protein THF1 displayed drought-resistance and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation similar to the <i>ppd5</i> mutants, but the <i>thf1-1ost1-3</i> double mutant resembled the phenotypes of the <i>thf1-1</i> single mutant. These results indicate that both OST1-dependent and OST1-independent pathways exist in the regulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in chloroplasts of guard cells under drought stress conditions. Additionally, our findings suggest a strategy to improve plant drought resistance through manipulation of chloroplast proteins.
