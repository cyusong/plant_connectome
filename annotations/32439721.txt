The epidermal surface of bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) is coated with a hydrophobic cuticular wax layer that protects plant tissues against environmental stresses. However, the regulatory mechanism of cuticular wax biosynthesis remains to be uncovered in bread wheat. Here, we identified wheat Enoyl-CoA Reductase (TaECR) as a core component responsible for biosynthesis of wheat cuticular wax. Silencing of <i>TaECR</i> in bread wheat resulted in a reduced cuticular wax load and attenuated conidia germination of the adapted fungal pathogen powdery mildew (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f.sp. <i>tritici</i>). Furthermore, we established that <i>TaECR</i> genes are direct targets of <i>TaECR</i> promoter-binding MYB transcription factor1 (TaEPBM1), which could interact with the adapter protein Alteration/Deficiency in Activation2 (TaADA2) and recruit the histone acetyltransferase General Control Nonderepressible5 (TaGCN5) to <i>TaECR</i> promoters. Most importantly, we demonstrated that the TaEPBM1-TaADA2-TaGCN5 ternary protein complex activates <i>TaECR</i> transcription by potentiating histone acetylation and enhancing RNA polymerase II enrichment at <i>TaECR</i> genes, thereby contributing to the wheat cuticular wax biosynthesis. Finally, we identified very-long-chain aldehydes as the wax signals provided by the TaECR-TaEPBM1-TaADA2-TaGCN5 circuit for triggering <i>B</i> <i>graminis</i> f.sp. <i>tritici</i> conidia germination. These results demonstrate that specific transcription factors recruit the TaADA2-TaGCN5 histone acetyltransferase complex to epigenetically regulate biosynthesis of wheat cuticular wax, which is required for triggering germination of the adapted powdery mildew pathogen.
