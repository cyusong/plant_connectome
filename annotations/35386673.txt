Soil salinity is one of the main factors limiting agricultural development worldwide and has an adverse effect on plant growth and yield. To date, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are considered to be one of the most promising eco-friendly strategies for improving saline soils. The bacterium <i>Bacillus megaterium</i> ZS-3 is an excellent PGPR strain that induces growth promotion as well as biotic stress resistance and tolerance to abiotic stress in a broad range of host plants. In this study, the potential mechanisms of protection against salinity stress by <i>B. megaterium</i> ZS-3 in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> were explored. Regulation by ZS-3 improved growth in <i>A</i>. <i>thaliana</i> under severe saline conditions. The results showed that ZS-3 treatment significantly increased the biomass, chlorophyll content and carotenoid content of <i>A</i>. <i>thaliana</i>. Compared to the control, the leaf area and total fresh weight of plants inoculated with ZS-3 increased by 245% and 271%, respectively; the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoid contents increased by 335%, 146%, and 372%, respectively, under salt stress. Physiological and biochemical tests showed that ZS-3 regulated the content of osmotic substances in plants under salt stress. Compared to the control, the soluble sugar content of the ZS-3-treated group was significantly increased by 288%, while the proline content was significantly reduced by 41.43%. Quantification of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> contents showed that ZS-3 treatment significantly reduced Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation and increased the K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio in plants. ZS-3 also isolated Na<sup>+</sup> in vesicles by upregulating <i>NHX1</i> and <i>AVP1</i> expression while limiting Na<sup>+</sup> uptake by downregulating <i>HKT1</i>, which protected against Na<sup>+</sup> toxicity. Higher levels of peroxidase and catalase activity and reduced glutathione were detected in plants inoculated with ZS-3 compared to those in uninoculated plants. In addition, it was revealed that ZS-3 activates salicylic acid (<i>NPR1</i> and <i>PR1</i>) and jasmonic acid/ethylene (<i>AOS</i>, <i>LOX2</i>, <i>PDF1.2</i>, and <i>ERF1</i>) signaling pathways to induce systemic tolerance, thereby inducing salt tolerance in plants. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that ZS-3 has the potential to act as an environmentally friendly salt tolerance inducer that can promote plant growth in salt-stressed environments.
