['17369435', 'Nucleolin is a major nucleolar protein implicated in many aspects of ribosomal  biogenesis, including early events such as processing of the large 35S  preribosomal RNA. We found that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) parallel1  (parl1) mutant, originally identified by its aberrant leaf venation, corresponds  to the Arabidopsis nucleolin gene. parl1 mutants display parallel leaf venation,  aberrant localization of the provascular marker Athb8:beta-glucuronidase, the  auxin-sensitive reporter DR5:beta-glucuronidase, and auxin-dependent growth  defects. PARL1 is highly similar to the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)  nucleolin NUCLEAR SIGNAL RECOGNITION 1 (NSR1) multifunctional protein; the  Arabidopsis PARL1 gene can rescue growth defects of yeast nsr1 null mutants. This  suggests that PARL1 protein may have roles similar to those of the yeast  nucleolin in nuclear signal recognition, ribosomal processing, and ribosomal  subunit accumulation. Based on the range of auxin-related defects in parl1  mutants, we propose that auxin-dependent organ growth and patterning is highly  sensitive to the efficiency of nucleolin-dependent ribosomal processing.', '2007 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.093575', 'Nelson']
