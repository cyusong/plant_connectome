Cassava is highly tolerant to stressful conditions, especially drought stress conditions; however, the mechanisms underlying this tolerance are poorly understood. The GRAS gene family is a large family of transcription factors that are involved in regulating the growth, development, and stress responses of plants. Currently, GRAS transcription factors have not been systematically studied in cassava, which is the sixth most important crop in the world. Seventy-seven MeGRAS genes were identified from the cassava genome database. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the MeGRAS proteins could be divided into 14 subfamilies. The gene structure and motif compositions of the proteins were considerably conserved within the same subfamily. Duplication events, particularly segmental duplication, were identified as the main driving force for GRAS gene expansion in cassava. Global expression analysis revealed that MeGRAS genes exhibited similar or distinct expression profiles within different tissues among different varieties. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed the expression patterns of MeGRAS genes in response to abiotic stress (drought, salt, cold, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and the results suggest that these genes may have multiple functions. This study is the first to provide comprehensive information on GRAS gene family members in cassava. The data will increase our understanding of both the molecular basis and the effects of GRAS genes. In addition, the results will contribute further to identifying the responses to various environmental conditions and provide insights into the potential functions of GRAS genes.
