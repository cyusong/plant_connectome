Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) is an essential organelle in eukaryotic cells. It acts not only as the sorting station of trafficking cargoes, but also as a signaling hub. In plant cells, TGN simultaneously takes the role of early endosome (EE) and contributes to the endocytic recycling. We recently characterized the first Golgi-localized protein Loss of TGNs (LOT) that is critical for TGN biogenesis and demonstrated its role during pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis. We also showed that the homozygous lot plant is dwarf and smaller than the wild type plant. As LOT is a single-copy gene and shows ubiquitous expression pattern, knowledge of its role in vegetative tissues, besides the pollen, is important for understanding the regulation of TGN/EE dynamics and signaling in plant development. Here, in this short communication, we present data to show that LOT also regulates TGN formation and Golgi structure in root meristem cells, and is critical for the elongation of hypocotyl and stamen filament.
