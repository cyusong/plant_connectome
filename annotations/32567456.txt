Cell cultures established from various plant species have been used for a range of physiological and biochemical studies. Homogeneity of cell types and size of clusters in the cell culture often gave a clearer and simpler results compared to those obtained with the whole plant. On the other hand, possible variability of physiological conditions and responsiveness to external stimuli between the cell lines could be problematic for comparative studies. Aiming at combining the usefulness of plant cell culture with the rich information and genetic resources of Arabidopsis, we systemically examined the methods/conditions to establish cell lines for comparative studies, which could be applicable to a variety of genetic resources. Arabidopsis cell lines thus established from the meristem of mature seeds showed reproducible and comparable MAMP responses such as ROS generation and defense-related gene expression. MAMP responses of the cultured cells showed the specificity depending on the presence/absence of the corresponding MAMP receptor. Pharmacological study with a protein kinase inhibitor, K252a, also showed the usefulness of the cell culture for such studies. These results indicated the usefulness of the method to establish Arabidopsis cell lines, which are useful for comparative studies between genetic resources.
