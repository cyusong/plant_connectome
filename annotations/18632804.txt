In view of the recent isolation of stable oil bodies as well as a unique oleosin from lily pollen, this study examined whether other minor proteins were present in this lipid-storage organelle. Immunological cross-recognition using antibodies against three minor oil-body proteins from sesame suggested that a putative caleosin was specifically detected in the oil-body fraction of pollen extract. A cDNA fragment encoding this putative pollen caleosin, obtained by PCR cloning, was confirmed by immunodetection and MALDI-MS analyses of the recombinant protein over-expressed in Escherichia coli and the native form. Caleosin in lily pollen oil bodies seemed to be a unique isoform distinct from that in lily seed oil bodies.
