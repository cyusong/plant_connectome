Seedlings of durum wheat and lentil were utilized to investigate the efficiency of magnetic water on growth and metabolic epicotyl profile. Tap water was passed through a magnetic device with a flow rate of max. 12900 - 13200 Gauss (G). Seeds and plantlets were grown on sand-free paper soaked by magnetized water, with unmagnetized tap water used in a control group. The growth parameters were collected at three time points (48, 96, and 144 hours after treatment), the same times at which metabolomic analysis was conducted on seeds, roots, and epicotyls. Although the effects varied with the species, tissues, and time point considered, compared with tap water (TW), the use of magnetized water treatment (MWT) led to higher root elongation in both genotypes. On the contrary, epicotyl length was not affected by treatment both in durum wheat and lentil. The results indicate that the use of magnetized water in agriculture can be considered a sustainable technology to promote plant development and quality with reduced and more efficient water usage, leading to cost-saving and environmental protection.

Magnetized water: !promotes! Root elongation 
Magnetized water: !does not affect! Epicotyl length
