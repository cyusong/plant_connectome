Space mutation causes genetic and phenotypic changes in biological materials. Transposon activation is an adaptive mechanism for organisms to cope with changes in the external environment, such as space mutation. Although transposon alterations have been widely reported in diverse plant species, few studies have assessed the global transposon alterations in plants exposed to the space environment. In this study, for the first time, the effects of transposon alterations in soybean caused by space mutation were considered. A new vegetable soybean variety, 'Zhexian 9' (Z9), derived from space mutation treatment of 'Taiwan 75' (T75), was genetically analyzed. Comparative analyses of these two soybean genomes uncovered surprising structural differences, especially with respect to translocation breakends, deletions, and inversions. In total, 12,028 structural variations (SVs) and 29,063 transposable elements (TEs) between T75 and Z9 were detected. In addition, 1336 potential genes were variable between T75 and Z9 in terms of SVs and TEs. These differential genes were enriched in functions such as defense response, cell wall-related processes, epigenetics, auxin metabolism and transport, signal transduction, and especially methylation, which implied that regulation of epigenetic mechanisms and TE activity are important in the space environment. These results are helpful for understanding the role of TEs in response to the space environment and provide a theoretical basis for the selection of wild plant materials suitable for space breeding.
