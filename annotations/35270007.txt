The zinc/iron-regulated transporter-like protein (ZIP) family has a crucial role in Zn homeostasis of plants. Although the ZIP genes have been systematically studied in many plant species, the significance of this family in wild emmer wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> ssp. <i>dicoccoides</i>) is not yet well understood. In this study, a genome-wide investigation of ZIPs genes based on the wild emmer reference genome was conducted, and 33 <i>TdZIP</i> genes were identified. Protein structure analysis revealed that TdZIP proteins had 1 to 13 transmembrane (TM) domains and most of them were predicted to be located on the plasma membrane. These <i>TdZIPs</i> can be classified into three clades in a phylogenetic tree. They were annotated as being involved in inorganic ion transport and metabolism. Cis-acting analysis showed that several elements were involved in hormone, stresses, grain-filling, and plant development. Expression pattern analysis indicated that <i>TdZIP</i> genes were highly expressed in different tissues. <i>TdZIP</i> genes showed different expression patterns in response to Zn deficiency and that 11 genes were significantly induced in either roots or both roots and shoots of Zn-deficient plants. Yeast complementation analysis showed that <i>TdZIP1A-3</i>, <i>TdZIP6B-1</i>, <i>TdZIP6B-2</i>, <i>TdZIP7A-3</i>, and <i>TdZIP7B-2</i> have the capacity to transport Zn. Overexpression of <i>TdZIP6B-1</i> in rice showed increased Zn concentration in roots compared with wild-type plants. The expression levels of <i>TdZIP6B-1</i> in transgenic rice were upregulated in normal Zn concentration compared to that of no Zn. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the ZIP gene family in wild emmer wheat and paves the way for future functional analysis and genetic improvement of Zn deficiency tolerance in wheat.
