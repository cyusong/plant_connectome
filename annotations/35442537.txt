Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), which reduces grain yield and quality, is controlled by seed dormancy genes. Because few dormancy-related genes have been cloned, the genetic basis of seed dormancy in rice (Oryza sativa L.) remains unclear. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study and linkage mapping to dissect the genetic basis of seed dormancy in rice. Our findings suggest that Seed Dormancy4 (Sdr4), a central modulator of seed dormancy, integrates the abscisic acid and gibberellic acid signaling pathways at the transcriptional level. Haplotype analysis revealed that three Sdr4 alleles in rice cultivars already existed in ancestral Oryza rufipogon accessions. Furthermore, like the semi-dwarf 1 (SD1) and Rc loci, Sdr4 underwent selection during the domestication and improvement of Asian cultivated rice. The distribution frequency of the Sdr4-n allele in different locations in Asia is negatively associated with local annual temperature and precipitation. Finally, we developed functional molecular markers for Sdr4, SD1, and Rc for use in molecular breeding. Our results provide clues about the molecular basis of Sdr4-regulated seed dormancy. Moreover, these findings provide guidance for utilizing the favorable alleles of Sdr4 and Rc to synergistically boost PHS resistance, yield, and quality in modern rice varieties.
