Cell elongation, which plays an important role in root penetration into the soil, responds to a variety of environmental factors. A previous study demonstrated that abscisic acid, a phytohormone involved in stress responses, inhibits root growth by delaying the onset of cell elongation. In contrast, we recently reported that cytokinins promote elongation of root cells by enhancing actin bundling. However, the control of root cell elongation through the interaction between abscisic acid and cytokinin signaling has not yet been uncovered. Here, we show that abscisic acid-induced delay in cell elongation requires inhibition of cytokinin signaling; further, stress is signaled to cell elongation by the pathway mediated by B-type ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 2 (ARR2), which retards root growth.
