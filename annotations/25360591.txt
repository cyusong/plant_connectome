['25360591', 'Iron deficiency is a nutritional problem in plants and reduces crop productivity,  quality and yield. With the goal of improving the iron (Fe) storage properties of  plants, we have investigated the function of three Arabidopsis proteins with  homology to Vacuolar Iron Transporter1 (AtVIT1). Heterologous expression of  Vacuolar Iron Transporter-Like1 (AtVTL1; At1g21140), AtVTL2 (At1g76800) or AtVTL5  (At3g25190) in the yeast vacuolar Fe transport mutant, Deltaccc1, restored growth in  the presence of 4 mM Fe. Isolated vacuoles from yeast expressing either of the  VTL genes in the Deltaccc1 background had a three- to four-fold increase in Fe  concentration compared to vacuoles isolated from the untransformed mutant.  Transiently expressed GFP-tagged AtVTL1 was localized exclusively and AtVTL2 was  localized primarily to the vacuolar membrane of onion epidermis cells. Seedling  root growth of the Arabidopsis nramp3/nramp4 and vit1-1 mutants was decreased  compared to the wild type when seedlings were grown under Fe deficiency. When  expressed under the 35S promoter in the nramp3/nramp4 or vit1-1 backgrounds,  AtVTL1, AtVTL2 or AtVTL5 restored root growth in both mutants. The seed Fe  concentration in the nramp3/nramp4 mutant overexpressing AtVTL1, AtVTL2 or AtVTL5  was between 50 and 60% higher than in non-transformed double mutants or wild-type  plants. We conclude that the VTL proteins catalyze Fe transport into vacuoles and  thus contribute to the regulation of Fe homeostasis in planta.', '2014', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0110468', 'Buckhout']
