Despite the significant progress in the identification of essential components of the nuclear transport machinery, some events of this process are still unclear. Particularly, functional information about the release of nuclear-exported macromolecules at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex and their subsequent trans-cytoplasmic movement is lacking. Recently, we identified a cytoplasmic GTPase, designated NIG (NSP-interacting GTPase), which may play a relevant role in these processes. NIG interacts in vivo with the geminivirus NSP and promotes the translocation of the viral protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it is redirected to the cell surface to interact with the viral movement protein, MP. Here we position the NIG function into the mechanistic model for the intracellular trafficking of viral DNA and discuss the putative role of NIG in general cellular nucleocytoplasmic transport of nucleic acid-protein complexes.
