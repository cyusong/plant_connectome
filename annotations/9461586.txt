['9461586', "We have cloned and sequenced the cDNA and the gene coding for plastid ribosomal  protein L4 (RPL4) from two higher plant species, spinach and Arabidopsis  thaliana. Ribosomal protein L4 is one of the ribosomal proteins for which  extraribosomal functions in transcriptional regulation has been demonstrated in  prokaryotes. Sequence comparison of the two plant cDNAs and genes shows that the  RPL4 gene has acquired a remarkable 3' extension during evolutionary transfer to  the nuclear genome. This extension harbors an intron and codes for a glutamic and  aspartic acid-rich amino acid sequence that resembles highly acidic C-terminal  tails of some transcription factors. Co-purification of ribosomal protein L4 with  plastid RNA polymerase and transcription factor CDF2 using different purification  protocols as well as the surprising amino acid sequence of the L4 protein make it  a likely candidate to play a role in plastid transcriptional regulation.", '1998 Feb 13', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.273.7.3980', 'Lerbs-Mache']
