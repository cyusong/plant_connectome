In this work, we have genetically transformed tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor cDNA (xPPARalpha) from Xenopus laevis, which is a transcriptional factor involved in the peroxisomal proliferation and induction of fatty acid beta-oxidation in animal cells. Several transgenic lines were generated and one representative line (T) from the R2 generation was selected for further studies. Analysis of free fatty acids revealed that unsaturated fatty acids such as C16:2 and C16:3 were deficient in line T, whereas saturated fatty acids like C16:0, C18:0, and C20:0 were more abundant than in non-transformed plants. Acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) activity was assayed as a marker enzyme of beta-oxidation in crude leaf extracts and it was found that in line T there was a threefold increase in enzyme activity. We also found that the peroxisome population was increased and that catalase (CAT) activity was induced by clofibrate, a known activator of xPPARalpha protein, in leaves from line T. Taken together, these findings suggest that xPPARalpha is functional in plants and that its expression in tobacco leads to changes in general lipid metabolism and peroxisomal proliferation as reported in animal cells. Furthermore, it indicates that there is an endogenous ligand in tobacco cells able to activate xPPARalpha.
