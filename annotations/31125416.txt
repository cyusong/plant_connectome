Anthropogenic activities, such as industrial processes, mining, and agriculture, lead to an increase in heavy metal concentrations in soil, water, and air. Given their stability in the environment, heavy metals are difficult to eliminate and can constitute a human health risk by entering the food chain through uptake by crop plants. An excess of heavy metals is toxic for plants, which have various mechanisms to prevent their accumulation. However, once metals enter the plant, oxidative damage sometimes occurs, which can lead to plant death. Initial production of nitric oxide (NO), which may play a role in plant perception, signalling, and stress acclimation, has been shown to protect against heavy metals. Very little is known about NO-dependent mechanisms downstream from signalling pathways in plant responses to heavy metal stress. In this review, using bioinformatic techniques, we analyse studies of the involvement of NO in plant responses to heavy metal stress, its possible role as a cytoprotective molecule, and its relationship with reactive oxygen species. Some conclusions are drawn and future research perspectives are outlined to further elucidate the signalling mechanisms underlying the role of NO in plant responses to heavy metal stress.
