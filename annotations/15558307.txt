The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stal) is a rice (Oryza sativa L.)-specific herbivore that ingests assimilates from the phloem, which leads to stunted growth and therefore poor yield of rice. In this study, 27 planthopper-responsive genes in rice plants were isolated by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), and confirmed by filter cDNA array hybridization and northern blot analysis. Among these transcripts, 25 were induced and 2 were suppressed by N. lugens feeding. The responsive genes are involved in photosynthesis, macromolecule degradation, signal transduction and defenses against stress and pathogens. Overall, genes involved in macromolecule degradation and plant defenses were up-regulated, whereas those involved in photosynthesis and cell growth were down-regulated. Our data suggest that leaf senescence is most likely activated in the susceptible rice plants damaged by N. lugens insects.
