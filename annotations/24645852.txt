Pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporters belonging to the ABCG subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are identified only in fungi and plants. Members of this family are expressed in plants in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses and transport a diverse array of molecules across membranes. Although their detailed transport mechanism is largely unknown, they play important roles in detoxification processes, preventing water loss, transport of phytohormones, and secondary metabolites. This review provides insights into transport mechanisms of plant PDR transporters, their expression profiles, and multitude functions in plants.
