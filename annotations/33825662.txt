Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants fix CO<sub>2</sub> at night, exhibiting a reversed regulatory pattern of metabolomic pathways compared with most model plants, which have C3 and C4 pathways. In this study, we used a valuable tropic fruit, red dragon fruit (<i>Hylocereus polyrhizus</i>), as model plant to identify and analyze the circadian regulation genes. Due to the absence of red dragon fruit's whole-genome dataset, we established a full-length transcriptome dataset using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing method. A 7.66-Gb dataset with 4,552,474 subreads was generated, with an average length of 1,683 bp and an N50 of 2,446 bp. Using this dataset, we identified center oscillator genes: <i>CCA1</i> (<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1), ELF3</i> (<i>EARLY FLOWERING 3), GI</i> (<i>GIGANTEA), LHY</i> (<i>LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL), LNK1</i> (<i>NIGHT LIGHT-INDUCIBLE AND CLOCK-REGULATED 1</i>), and <i>TOC1</i> (<i>TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1</i>); a gene for the input pathway: <i>CRY1</i> (<i>CRYPTOCHROME</i>); a gene for the output pathway: <i>CO</i> (<i>CONSTANS</i>); and genes related to the CAM pathway: <i>MDH</i> (<i>MALATE DEHYDROGENASE), ME</i> (<i>MALIC ENZYMES</i>), and <i>PPDK</i> (<i>PYRUVATE PHOSPHATE DIKINASE</i>). We further established the 24-h rhythmic expression pattern of these genes and classified these into three groups: <i>HpCCA1, HpELF3, HpLHY, HpLNK1</i>, and <i>HpGI</i> have expression peaks during the day; <i>HpTOC1, HpCO</i>, and <i>HpCRY1</i> have highest expression levels at night; The genes involved in the CAM pathways, namely, <i>HpMDH, HpME1</i>, and <i>HpPPDK</i>, have double expression peaks in the day and night. Comparison of these expression patterns between red dragon fruit and model plants could provide clues in understanding the circadian clock regulation and the activity of the CAM pathways in cactus plants.
