Seeds germinating underground display a specific developmental programme, termed skotomorphogenesis, to ensure survival of the emerging seedlings until they reach the light. They rapidly elongate the hypocotyl and maintain the cotyledons closed, forming a hook with the hypocotyl in order to protect apical meristematic cells from mechanical damage. Such crucial events for the fate of the seedling are tightly regulated and although some transcriptional regulators and phytohormones are known to be implicated in this regulation, we are still far from a complete understanding of these biological processes. Our work provides information on the diverse roles in skotomorphogenesis of the core components of microRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis, HYL1, DCL1, and SE. We show that hypocotyl elongation is promoted by all these components, probably through the action of specific miRNAs. Hook development also depends on these proteins however, remarkably, HYL1 exerts its role in an opposite way to DCL1 and SE. Interestingly, we found that a specific HYL1 domain involved in protein-protein interaction is required for this function. Genetic evidences also point to the phosphorylation status of HYL1 as important for this function. We propose that HYL1 help maintain the hook closed during early skotomorphogenesis in a microprocessor-independent manner by repressing the activity of HY5, the transcriptional master regulator that triggers light responses. This work uncovers a previously unnoticed link between components of the miRNA biogenesis machinery, the skotomorphogenic growth, and hook development in Arabidopsis.
