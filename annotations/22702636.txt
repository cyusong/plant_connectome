['22702636', 'Floral initiation is orchestrated by systemic floral activators and inhibitors.  This remote-control system may integrate environmental cues to modulate floral  initiation. Recently, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) was found to be a florigen. However,  the identity of systemic floral inhibitor or anti-florigen remains to be  elucidated. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana CENTRORADIALIS homologue  (ATC), an Arabidopsis FT homologue, may act in a non-cell autonomous manner to  inhibit floral initiation. Analysis of the ATC null mutant revealed that ATC is a  short-day-induced floral inhibitor. Cell type-specific expression showed that  companion cells and apex that express ATC are sufficient to inhibit floral  initiation. Histochemical analysis showed that the promoter activity of ATC was  mainly found in vasculature but under the detection limit in apex, a finding that  suggests that ATC may move from the vasculature to the apex to influence  flowering. Consistent with this notion, Arabidopsis seedling grafting experiments  demonstrated that ATC moved over a long distance and that floral inhibition by  ATC is graft transmissible. ATC probably antagonizes FT activity, because both  ATC and FT interact with FD and affect the same downstream meristem identity  genes APETALA1, in an opposite manner. Thus, photoperiodic variations may trigger  functionally opposite FT homologues to systemically influence floral initiation.', '2012 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05076.x', 'Yu']
