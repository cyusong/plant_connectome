DNA methylation plays essential homeostatic functions in eukaryotic genomes. In animals, DNA methylation is also developmentally regulated and, in turn, regulates development. In the past two decades, huge research effort has endorsed the understanding that DNA methylation plays a similar role in plant development, especially during sexual reproduction. The power of whole-genome sequencing and cell isolation techniques, as well as bioinformatics tools, have enabled recent studies to reveal dynamic changes in DNA methylation during germline development. Furthermore, the combination of these technological advances with genetics, developmental biology and cell biology tools has revealed functional methylation reprogramming events that control gene and transposon activities in flowering plant germlines. In this review, we discuss the major advances in our knowledge of DNA methylation dynamics during male and female germline development in flowering plants.
