Soybean is an important cash crop in the world, and drought is the main reason for the loss of soybean plants productivity, with drought stress during the most water-sensitive flowering period of soybeans. In this article, drought-tolerant variety Heinong 44 (HN44) and drought-sensitive variety Heinong 65 (HN65) were used as experimental materials. Drought treatment was carried out at the early flowering stage. The method of controlling soil moisture content was used to simulate different degrees of drought, and the physiological changes of these two varieties of soybean under different soil moisture contents were studied. The results showed that with a decrease in soil moisture content, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in soybean leaves increased significantly; the activities of peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbic acid peroxidase (APX) increased first and then decreased; the content of proline, soluble sugar, and soluble protein increased; and the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) increased significantly. When the soil moisture content was 15.5%, the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation, osmotic regulatory substances, antioxidant enzyme activity, and T-AOC increased the most, and the decrease in drought-tolerant variety HN44 was significantly less than that of drought-sensitive variety HN65. Our research reveals the response law of soybean crops to physiological characteristics under water deficit and provides theoretical basis and guiding significance for drought-resistant cultivation and breeding of soybean.

MDA: !increases with! decrease in soil moisture
POD/CAT/APX: !increase then decrease with! decrease in soil moisture
Proline/sugar/protein: !increase with! decrease in soil moisture
T-AOC: !increases significantly with! decrease in soil moisture
HN44: !less affected by! drought than HN65
