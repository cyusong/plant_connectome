Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) refers to the silencing of genes in pathogens and pests by expressing homologous double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) or artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) in the host plant. The discovery of such trans-kingdom RNA silencing has enabled the development of RNA interference-based approaches for controlling diverse crop pathogens and pests. Although HIGS is a promising strategy, the mechanisms by which these regulatory RNAs translocate from plants to pathogens, and how they induce gene silencing in pathogens, are poorly understood. This lack of understanding has led to large variability in the efficacy of various HIGS treatments. This variability is likely due to multiple factors, such as the ability of the target pathogen or pest to take up and/or process RNA from the host, the specific genes and target sequences selected in the pathogen or pest for silencing, and where, when, and how the dsRNAs or amiRNAs are produced and translocated. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about the molecular mechanisms underlying HIGS, identify key unanswered questions, and explore strategies for improving the efficacy and reproducibility of HIGS treatments in the control of crop diseases.
