Mounting evidence suggests that microtubules play important roles in several aspects of autophagy in mammalian cells, such as autophagosome biogenesis, autophagosome trafficking and autolysosome formation. However, little research attention has been paid to the engagement of microtubules in plant autophagy. Recently, we reported novel findings in Nicotiana benthamiana that disruption of microtubules reduces autophagosome formation during upregulation of macroautophagy and triggers a specific type of chloroplast autophagy (SEX chlorophagy), which is closely associated with the starch-excess phenotype of leaves. These findings reveal important functional links between microtubules, autophagy and leaf starch degradation in plants.
