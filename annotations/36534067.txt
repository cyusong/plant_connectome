Male sterility provides an efficient approach for commercial exploitation of heterosis. Despite more than 20 genic male sterile (GMS) mutants documented in pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), only two causal genes have been successfully identified. Here, a novel spontaneous recessive GMS mutant, designated msc-3, is identified and characterized at both phenotypic and histological levels. Pollen abortion of msc-3 mutant may be due to the delayed tapetum degradation, leading to the non-degeneration of tetrads callosic wall. Then, a modified MutMap method and molecular marker linkage analysis were employed to fine mapping the msc-3 locus, which was delimited to the ~139.91-kb region harboring 10 annotated genes. Gene expression and structure variation analyses indicate the Capana10g000198, encoding a R2R3-MYB transcription factor, is the best candidate gene for the msc-3 locus. Expression profiling analysis shows the Capana10g000198 is an anther-specific gene, and a 163-bp insertion in the Capana10g000198 is highly correlated with the male sterile (MS) phenotype. Additionally, downregulation of Capana10g000198 in male fertile plants through virus-induced gene silencing resulted in male sterility. Finally, possible regulatory relationships of the msc-3 gene with the other two reported pepper GMS genes, msc-1 and msc-2, have been studied, and comparative transcriptome analysis reveals the expression of 16 GMS homologs are significantly downregulated in the MS anthers. Overall, our results reveal that Capana10g000198 is the causal gene underlying the msc-3 locus, providing important theoretical clues and basis for further in-depth study on the regulatory mechanisms of pollen development in pepper.
