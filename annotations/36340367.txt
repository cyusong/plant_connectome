The Elongator complex in eukaryotes has conserved tRNA modification functions and contributes to various physiological processes such as transcriptional control, DNA replication and repair, and chromatin accessibility. <i>ARABIDOPSIS</i> ELONGATOR PROTEIN 4 (AtELP4) is one of the six subunits (AtELP1-AtELP6) in <i>Arabidopsis</i> Elongator. In addition, there is an Elongator-associated protein, DEFORMED ROOTS AND LEAVES 1 (DRL1), whose homolog in yeast (Kti12) binds tRNAs. In this study, we explored the functions of AtELP4 in plant-specific aspects such as leaf morphogenesis and evolutionarily conserved ones between yeast and <i>Arabidopsis</i>. ELP4 comparison between yeast and <i>Arabidopsis</i> revealed that plant ELP4 possesses not only a highly conserved P-loop ATPase domain but also unknown plant-specific motifs. ELP4 function is partially conserved between <i>Arabidopsis</i> and yeast in the growth sensitivity toward caffeine and elevated cultivation temperature. Either single <i>Atelp4</i> or <i>drl1-102</i> mutants and double <i>Atelp4 drl1-102</i> mutants exhibited a reduction in cell proliferation and changed the adaxial-abaxial polarity of leaves. In addition, the single <i>Atelp4</i> and double <i>Atelp4 drl1-102</i> mutants showed remarkable downward curling at the whole part of leaf blades in contrast to wild-type leaf blades. Furthermore, our genetic study revealed that <i>AtELP4</i> might epistatically act on <i>DRL1</i> in the regulation of cell proliferation and dorsoventral polarity in leaves. Taken together, we suggest that AtELP4 as part of the plant Elongator complex may act upstream of a regulatory pathway for adaxial-abaxial polarity and cell proliferation during leaf development.
