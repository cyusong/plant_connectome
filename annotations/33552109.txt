Digital farming is a novel agricultural philosophy that aims to maximize a crop yield with the minimal environmental impact. Digital farming requires the development of technologies that can work directly in the field providing information about a plant health. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is an emerging analytical technique that can be used for non-invasive, non-destructive, and confirmatory diagnostics of diseases, as well as the nutrient deficiencies in plants. RS is also capable of probing nutritional content of grains, as well as highly accurate identification plant species and their varieties. This allows for Raman-based phenotyping and digital selection of plants. These pieces of evidence suggest that RS can be used for chemical-free surveillance of plant health directly in the field. High selectivity and specificity of this technique show that RS may transform the agriculture in the US. This review critically discusses the most recent research articles that demonstrate the use of RS in diagnostics of abiotic and abiotic stresses in plants, as well as the identification of plant species and their nutritional analysis.
