Meristems house the stem cells needed for the developmental plasticity observed in adverse environmental conditions and are crucial for determining plant architecture. Meristem development is particularly sensitive to deficiencies of the micronutrient boron, yet how boron integrates into meristem development pathways is unknown. We addressed this question using the boron-deficient maize mutant, tassel-less1 (tls1). Reduced boron uptake in tls1 leads to a progressive impairment of meristem development that manifests in vegetative and reproductive defects. We show, that the tls1 tassel phenotype (male reproductive structure) was partially suppressed by mutations in the CLAVATA1 (CLV1)-ortholog, thick tassel dwarf1 (td1), but not by other mutants in the well characterized CLV-WUSCHEL pathway, which controls meristem size. The suppression of tls1 by td1 correlates with altered signaling of the phytohormone cytokinin. In contrast, mutations in the meristem maintenance gene knotted1 (kn1) enhanced both vegetative and reproductive defects in tls1. In addition, reduced transcript levels of kn1 and cell cycle genes are early defects in tls1 tassel meristems. Our results show that specific meristem maintenance and hormone pathways are affected in tls1, and suggest that reduced boron levels induced by tls1 are the underlying cause of the observed defects. We, therefore, provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms affected by boron deficiency in maize, leading to a better understanding of how genetic and environmental factors integrate during shoot meristem development.
