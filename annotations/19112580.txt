Physiological data from extreme habitat organisms during stresses are vital information for comprehending their survival. The intertidal seaweeds are exposed to a combination of environmental stresses, the most influential one being regular dehydration and re-hydration. Porphyra katadai var. hemiphylla is a unique intertidal macroalga species with two longitudinally separated, color distinct, sexually different parts. In this study, the photosynthetic performance of both PSI and PSII of the two sexually different parts of P. katadai thalli during dehydration and re-hydration was investigated. Under low-grade dehydration the variation of photosystems of male and female parts of P. katadai were similar. However, after the absolute water content reached 42%, the PSI of the female parts was nearly shut down while that of the male parts still coordinated well and worked properly with PSII. Furthermore, after re-hydration with a better conditioned PSI, the dehydrated male parts were able to restore photosynthesis within 1 h, while the female parts did not. It is concluded that in P. katadai the susceptibility of photosynthesis to dehydration depends on the accommodative ability of PSI. The relatively lower content of phycobiliprotein in male parts may be the cause for a stronger PSI after severe dehydration.
