UDP-D-glucuronate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.35) catalyzes the synthesis of UDP-D-xylose from UDP-D-glucuronate in an essentially irreversible reaction that is believed to commit glycosyl residues to heteroxylan and xyloglucan biosynthesis. Four members of the barley (Hordeum vulgare) UDP-D-glucuronate decarboxylase gene family, designated HvUXS1 to HvUXS4, have been cloned and characterized. Barley HvUXS1 appears to be a cytosolic enzyme, while the others are predicted to be membrane-bound proteins with single transmembrane helices. Heterologous expression of a barley HvUXS1 cDNA in Escherichia coli yields a soluble enzyme that converts UDP-d-glucuronate to UDP-D-xylose, is associated with a single molecule of bound NAD+, and is subject to feedback inhibition by UDP-D-xylose. Quantitative PCR shows that the HvUXS1 mRNA is most abundant among the 4 HvUXS genes, accounting for more than 80% of total HvUXS transcripts in most of the tissues examined. The abundance of HvUXS1 mRNA is 10-fold higher in mature roots and stems than in leaves, developing grains, or floral tissues. Transcriptional activities of HvUXS2 and HvUXS4 genes are relatively high in mature roots, coleoptiles, and stems compared with root tips, leaves, and floral tissues, while HvUXS3 mRNA is low in all tissues. In barley leaf sections, levels of the most abundant mRNA, encoding HvUXS1, reflect the amount of soluble enzymic protein and activity. In selected tissues where HvUXS1 transcript levels are high, cell walls have higher arabinoxylan contents.
