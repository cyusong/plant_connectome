Traditional herbal medicines based on natural products play a pivotal role in preventing and managing atherosclerotic diseases, which are among the leading causes of death globally. Monoterpenes are a large class of naturally occurring compounds commonly found in many aromatic and medicinal plants. Emerging evidence has shown that monoterpenes have many biological properties, including cardioprotective effects. Remarkably, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of natural monoterpenes to protect against the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. These findings shed light on developing novel effective antiatherogenic drugs from these compounds. Herein, we provide an overview of natural monoterpenes' effects on atherogenesis and the underlying mechanisms. Monoterpenes have pleiotropic and multitargeted pharmacological properties by interacting with various cell types and intracellular molecular pathways involved in atherogenesis. These properties confer remarkable advantages in managing atherosclerosis, which has been recognized as a multifaceted vascular disease. We also discuss limitations in the potential clinical application of monoterpenes as therapeutic agents against atherosclerosis. We propose perspectives to give new insights into future preclinical research and clinical practice regarding natural monoterpenes.
