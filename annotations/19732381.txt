['19732381', 'N-linked glycosylation is an essential protein modification that helps protein  folding, trafficking and translocation in eukaryotic systems. The initial process  for N-linked glycosylation shares a common pathway with assembly of a  dolichol-linked core oligosaccharide. Here we characterize a new Arabidopsis  thaliana mutant lew3 (leaf wilting 3), which has a defect in an  alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, a homolog of ALG11 in yeast, that transfers  mannose to the dolichol-linked core oligosaccharide in the last two steps on the  cytosolic face of the ER in N-glycan precursor synthesis. LEW3 is localized to  the ER membrane and expressed throughout the plant. Mutation of LEW3 caused  low-level accumulation of Man(3)GlcNAc(2) and Man(4)GlcNAc(2) glycans, structures  that are seldom detected in wild-type plants. In addition, the lew3 mutant has  low levels of normal high-mannose-type glycans, but increased levels of  complex-type glycans. The lew3 mutant showed abnormal developmental phenotypes,  reduced fertility, impaired cellulose synthesis, abnormal primary cell walls, and  xylem collapse due to disturbance of the secondary cell walls. lew3 mutants were  more sensitive to osmotic stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Protein  N-glycosylation was reduced and the unfolded protein response was more activated  by osmotic stress and ABA treatment in the lew3 mutant than in the wild-type.  These results demonstrate that protein N-glycosylation plays crucial roles in  plant development and the response to abiotic stresses.', '2009 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04013.x', 'Gong']
