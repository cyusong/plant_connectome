Living organisms such as plants and animals have evolved endogenous clocks in order to anticipate the environmental changes associated with the earth's rotation and to orchestrate biological processes in the course of the 24 hour daily cycle. We have recently identified clock components in the primitive green picoalga Ostreococcus tauri, a promising minimal cellular and genomic model for systems biology approaches. A homologue of the Arabidopsis core clock gene Time of CAB expression-1 (TOC1) was shown to play a central role in Ostreococcus heralding an early emergence of clock components in the green lineage. Here we report the regulation of TOC1 at dusk in response to light and dark cues.
