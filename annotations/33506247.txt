The size of leaf and seed organs, determined by the interplay of cell proliferation and expansion, is closely related to the final yield and quality of forage and crops. Yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying organ size modulation remain poorly understood, especially in legumes. Here, MINI ORGAN1 (MIO1), which encodes an F-box protein SMALL LEAF AND BUSHY1 (SLB1) recently reported to control lateral branching in Medicago truncatula, was identified as a key regulator of organ size. We show that loss-of-function of MIO1/SLB1 severely reduced organ size. Conversely, plants overexpressing MIO1/SLB1 had enlarged organs. Cellular analysis revealed that MIO1/SLB1 controlled organ size mainly by modulating primary cell proliferation during the early stages of leaf development. Biochemical analysis revealed that MIO1/SLB1 could form part of SKP1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, to target BIG SEEDS1 (BS1), a repressor of primary cell division, for degradation. Interestingly, we found that MIO1/SLB1 also played a key role in pulvinus development and leaf movement by modulating cell proliferation of the pulvinus as leaves developed. Our study not only demonstrates a conserved role of MIO1/SLB1 in the control of organ size in legumes, but also sheds light on the novel function of MIO1/SLB1 in leaf movement.
