['18028262', 'The putative two-pore Ca(2+) channel TPC1 has been suggested to be involved in  responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. We show that AtTPC1 co-localizes with  the K(+)-selective channel AtTPK1 in the vacuolar membrane. Loss of AtTPC1  abolished Ca(2+)-activated slow vacuolar (SV) currents, which were increased in  AtTPC1-over-expressing Arabidopsis compared to the wild-type. A  Ca(2+)-insensitive vacuolar cation channel, as yet uncharacterized, could be  resolved in tpc1-2 knockout plants. The kinetics of ABA- and CO(2)-induced  stomatal closure were similar in wild-type and tpc1-2 knockout plants, excluding  a role of SV channels in guard-cell signalling in response to these physiological  stimuli. ABA-, K(+)-, and Ca(2+)-dependent root growth phenotypes were not  changed in tpc1-2 compared to wild-type plants. Given the permeability of SV  channels to mono- and divalent cations, the question arises as to whether TPC1 in  vivo represents a pathway for Ca(2+) entry into the cytosol. Ca(2+) responses as  measured in aequorin-expressing wild-type, tpc1-2 knockout and  TPC1-over-expressing plants disprove a contribution of TPC1 to any of the  stimulus-induced Ca(2+) signals tested, including abiotic stresses (cold,  hyperosmotic, salt and oxidative), elevation in extracellular Ca(2+)  concentration and biotic factors (elf18, flg22). In good agreement, stimulus- and  Ca(2+)-dependent gene activation was not affected by alterations in TPC1  expression. Together with our finding that the loss of TPC1 did not change the  activity of hyperpolarization-activated Ca(2+)-permeable channels in the plasma  membrane, we conclude that TPC1, under physiological conditions, functions as a  vacuolar cation channel without a major impact on cytosolic Ca(2+) homeostasis.', '2008 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03342.x', 'Dietrich']
