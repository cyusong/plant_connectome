Sugarcane is among the most important global crops and a key bioenergy source. Sugarcane production is restricted by limited levels of available soil potassium (K<sup>+</sup>). The ability of plants to respond to stressors can be regulated by a range of microRNAs (miRNAs). However, there have been few studies regarding the roles of miRNAs in the regulation of sugarcane responses to K<sup>+</sup>-deficiency. To understand how these non-coding RNAs may influence sugarcane responses to low-K<sup>+</sup> stress, we conducted expression profiling of miRNAs in sugarcane roots under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions <i>via</i> high-throughput sequencing. This approach led to the identification of 324 and 42 known and novel miRNAs, respectively, of which 36 were found to be differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions. These results also suggested that miR156-x/z and miR171-x are involved in these responses as potential regulators of lateral root formation and the ethylene signaling pathway, respectively. A total of 705 putative targets of these DEMs were further identified through bioinformatics predictions and degradome analyses, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed these target mRNAs to be enriched for catalytic activity, binding functions, metabolic processes, plant hormone signal transduction, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In summary, these data provide an overview of the roles of miRNAs in the regulation of sugarcane response to low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions.
