Clematis plants play an important role in botanical gardens. Heat stress can destroy the activity, state and conformation of plant proteins, and its regulatory pathway has been well characterized in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and some crop plants. However, the heat resistance response mechanism in horticultural plants including <i>Clematis</i> has rarely been reported. Here, we identified a heat-tolerant clematis species, <i>Clematis vitalba</i>. The relative water loss and electrolytic leakage were significantly lower under heat treatment in <i>Clematis vitalba</i> compared to Stolwijk Gold. Differential expression heat-tolerant genes (HTGs) were identified based on nonparametric transcriptome analysis. For validation, one heat shock transcription factor, <i>CvHSF30-2</i>, extremely induced by heat stimuli in <i>Clematis vitalba</i>, was identified to confer tolerance to heat stress in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Furthermore, silencing of <i>HSF30-2</i> by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) led to heat sensitivity in tobacco and <i>Clematis</i>, suggesting that the candidate heat-resistant genes identified in this RNA-seq analysis are credible and offer significant utility. We also found that <i>CvHSF30-2</i> improved heat tolerance of <i>Clematis vitalba</i> by elevating heat shock protein (HSP) expression, which was negatively regulated by <i>CvHSFB2a</i>. Taken together, this study provides insights into the mechanism of <i>Clematis</i> heat tolerance and the findings can be potentially applied in horticultural plants to improve economic efficiency through genetic approaches.
