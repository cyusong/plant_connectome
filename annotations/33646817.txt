<i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> is an important soil-borne fungal pathogen that causes serious diseases on many agricultural crops and vegetables. Here, we report a complete genome assembly of <i>R. solani</i> AG4 (assembly: 45.47 Mb; contig N<sub>50</sub>: 1.56 Mb), using a combination of Illumina paired-end and PacBio long-read sequencing data. A total of 267 noncoding RNAs and 11,592 genes were predicted, including 109 genes associated with carbohydrate-active enzymes and 2,488 genes involved in host-pathogen interactions. The complete genome of <i>R. solani</i> AG4 represents a valuable base for studying interactions between host plants and pathogenic fungi and to search for potential antimicrobial targets.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
