['10847686', 'We have conducted genetic screens for period length mutants in Arabidopsis using  a transgenic bioluminescence phenotype. This screen identified mutations at a  locus, ZEITLUPE (ZTL), that lengthen the free-running period of clock-controlled  gene transcription and cell expansion, and alter the timing of the  daylength-dependent transition from vegetative to floral development. Map-based  cloning of ZTL identified a novel 609 amino acid polypeptide consisting of an  amino-terminal PAS domain, an F box and six carboxy-terminal kelch repeats. The  PAS region is highly similar to the PAS domain of the Arabidopsis blue-light  receptor NPH1, and the Neurospora circadian-associated protein WHITE COLLAR-1  (WC-1). The striking fluence rate-dependent effect of the ztl mutations suggests  that ZTL plays a primary role in the photocontrol of circadian period in higher  plants.', '2000 Apr 28', 'Cell', '10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80841-7', 'Kay']
