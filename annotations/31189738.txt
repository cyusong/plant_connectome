The unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a classical reference organism for studying photosynthesis, chloroplast biology, cell cycle control, and cilia structure and function. It is also an emerging model for studying sensory cilia, the production of high-value bioproducts, and in situ structural determination. Much of the early appeal of Chlamydomonas was rooted in its promise as a genetic system, but like other classic model organisms, this rise to prominence predated the discovery of the structure of DNA, whole-genome sequences, and molecular techniques for gene manipulation. The haploid genome of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> facilitates genetic analyses and offers many of the advantages of microbial systems applied to a photosynthetic organism. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> has contributed to our understanding of chloroplast-based photosynthesis and cilia biology. Despite pervasive transgene silencing, technological advances have allowed researchers to address outstanding lines of inquiry in algal research. The most thoroughly studied unicellular alga, <i>C. reinhardtii</i>, is the current standard for algal research, and although genome editing is still far from efficient and routine, it nevertheless serves as a template for other algae. We present a historical retrospective of the rise of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> to illuminate its past and present. We also present resources for current and future scientists who may wish to expand their studies to the realm of microalgae.
