['31189737', 'Brassinosteroids (BRs) form a group of steroidal hormones essential for plant  growth, development, and stress responses. BRs are perceived extracellularly by  plasma membrane receptor-like kinases that activate an interconnected signal  transduction cascade, leading to the transcriptional regulation of BR-responsive  genes. TETRATRICOPEPTIDE THIOREDOXIN-LIKE (TTL) genes are specific for land  plants, and their encoded proteins are defined by the presence of protein-protein  interaction motives, that is, an intrinsic disordered region at the N terminus,  six tetratricopeptide repeat domains, and a C terminus with homology to  thioredoxins. TTL proteins thus likely mediate the assembly of multiprotein  complexes. Phenotypic, molecular, and genetic analyses show that TTL proteins are  positive regulators of BR signaling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). TTL3  directly interacts with a constitutively active BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1  (BRI1) receptor kinase, BRI1-SUPPRESSOR1 phosphatase, and the BRASSINAZOLE  RESISTANT1 transcription factor and associates with BR-SIGNALING KINASE1,  BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2 kinases, but not with BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1. A  functional TTL3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) shows dual cytoplasmic plasma  membrane localization. Depleting the endogenous BR content reduces plasma  membrane localization of TTL3-GFP, while increasing BR content causes its plasma  membrane relocalization, where it strengthens the association of BR signaling  components. Our results reveal that TTL proteins promote BR responses and suggest  that TTL proteins may function as scaffold proteins by bringing together  cytoplasmic and plasma membrane BR signaling components.', '2019 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.19.00150', 'ORCID:']
