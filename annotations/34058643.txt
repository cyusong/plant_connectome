The halophyte ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) converts its mode of photosynthesis from C<sub>3</sub> to crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) during severe water stress. During the transition to CAM, the plant induces CAM-related genes and changes its diurnal stomatal behavior to take up CO<sub>2</sub> efficiently at night. However, limited information concerning this signaling exists. Here, we investigated the changes in the diurnal stomatal behavior of M. crystallinum during its shift in photosynthesis using a detached epidermis. M. crystallinum plants grown under C<sub>3</sub> conditions opened their stomata during the day and closed them at night. However, CAM-induced plants closed their stomata during the day and opened them at night. Quantitative analysis of endogenous phytohormones revealed that trans-zeatin levels were high in CAM-induced plants. In contrast, the levels of jasmonic acid (JA) and JA-isoleucine were severely reduced in CAM-induced plants, specifically at night. CAM induction did not alter the levels of abscisic acid; however, inhibitors of abscisic acid synthesis suppressed CAM-induced stomatal closure. These results indicate that M. crystallinum regulates the diurnal balance of cytokinin and JA during CAM transition to alter stomatal behavior.
