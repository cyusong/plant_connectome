Photosynthesis, a fundamental process for plant growth and development, is dependent on chloroplast formation and chlorophyll synthesis. Severe disruption of chloroplast structure results in albinism of higher plants. In the present study, we report a cucumber albino <i>alc</i> mutant that presented white cotyledons under normal light conditions and was unable to produce first true leaf. Meanwhile, <i>alc</i> mutant could grow creamy green cotyledons under dim light conditions but died after exposure to normal light irradiation. No chlorophyll and carotenoid were detected in the <i>alc</i> mutant grown under normal light conditions. Using transmission electron microscopy, impaired chloroplasts were observed in this mutant. The genetic analysis indicated that the albino phenotype was recessively controlled by a single locus. Comparative transcriptomic analysis between the <i>alc</i> mutant and wild type revealed that genes involved in chlorophyll metabolism and the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway were affected in the <i>alc</i> mutant. In addition, three genes involved in chloroplast development, including two <i>FtsH</i> genes and one <i>PPR</i> gene, were found to have negligible expression in this mutant. The quality of RNA sequencing results was further confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR analysis. We also examined 12 homologous genes from <i>alc</i> mutant in other plant species, but no genetic variation in the coding sequences of these genes was found between <i>alc</i> mutant and wild type. Taken together, we characterized a cucumber albino mutant with albinism phenotype caused by chloroplast development deficiency and this mutant can pave way for future studies on plastid development.
