In vivo doubled-haploid technology is widely applied in commercial maize breeding programs because of its time-saving and cost-reducing features. The production of maize haploids primarily depends on the use of Stock6-derived haploid inducer lines. Although the gene underlying haploid induction, MTL/ZmPLA1/NLD, was cloned recently, the mechanism of haploid induction is still unknown. Hetero-fertilization can occur via a single fertilization, which provides a means to investigate single-fertilization events by studying the hetero-fertilization phenomenon. In this study, we found that the hetero-fertilization rate increased significantly when female maize lines were first individually crossed with pollen from the inducer CAU5 in dual-pollination experiments 4 h before a second pollination with common lines. We also examined embryogenesis during haploid induction by confocal laser-scanning microscopy and observed single-fertilized ovules, indicating that single fertilization occurred during haploid induction. We therefore postulate that both single fertilization and chromosome elimination contribute to haploid induction in maize. We also propose a scheme for the formation of hetero-fertilized and haploid kernels. Our results provide an efficient approach to identify hetero-fertilized kernels for research on interactions between embryo and endosperm.
