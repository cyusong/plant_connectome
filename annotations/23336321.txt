Recent omics technologies provide information on multiple components of biological networks. Web-based data mining tools are continuously being developed. Because genes involved in specialized (secondary) metabolism are often co-ordinately regulated at the transcriptional level, a number of gene discovery studies have been successfully conducted using network analysis, especially by integrating gene co-expression network analysis and metabolomic investigation. In addition, next-generation sequencing technologies are currently utilized in functional genomics investigations of Arabidopsis and non-model plant species including medicinal plants. Systems-based approaches are expected to gain importance in medicinal plant research. This review discussed network analysis in Arabidopsis and gene discovery in plant-specialized metabolism in non-model plants.
