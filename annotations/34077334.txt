Hypoxia stress can be caused by submergence or pathogen infection. These two stresses often occur sequentially or at the same time in nature. Therefore, plants have evolved economical and efficient strategies to deal with them, such as "single-gene multi-functions", that is, one gene could play roles in hypoxia or pathogen responses at the corresponding stress. This review mainly introduces the ERF-VII (ethylene response factor VII) and WRKYs (WRKY transcription factors) that can play roles in these two stresses. Meanwhile, the relationship between hypoxia and pathology has certain similarities in animals and plants, so we can learn from their related studies and develop new ideas for disease therapy and breeding.
