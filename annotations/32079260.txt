The use of herbicides is an effective and economic way to control weeds, but their availability for rapeseed is limited due to the shortage of herbicide-resistant cultivars in China. The single-point mutation in the <i>acetohydroxyacid</i> <i>synthase</i> (<i>AHAS</i>) gene can lead to AHAS-inhibiting herbicide resistance. In this study, the inheritance and molecular characterization of the tribenuron-methyl (TBM)-resistant rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.) mutant, <i>K5,</i> are performed. Results indicated that TBM-resistance of <i>K5</i> was controlled by one dominant allele at a single nuclear gene locus. The novel substitution of cytosine with thymine at position 544 in <i>BnAHAS1</i> was identified in <i>K5</i>, leading to the alteration of proline with serine at position 182 in BnAHAS1. The TBM-resistance of <i>K5</i> was approximately 100 times that of its wild-type <i>ZS9</i>, and <i>K5</i> also showed cross-resistance to bensufuron-methyl and monosulfuron-ester sodium. The <i>BnAHAS1</i><sup>544T</sup> transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> exhibited higher TBM-resistance than that of its wild-type, which confirmed that <i>BnAHAS1</i><sup>544T</sup> was responsible for the herbicide resistance of <i>K5</i>. Simultaneously, an allele-specific marker was developed to quickly distinguish the heterozygous and homozygous mutated alleles <i>BnAHAS1</i><sup>544T</sup>. In addition, a method for the fast screening of TBM-resistant plants at the cotyledon stage was developed. Our research identified and molecularly characterized one novel mutative <i>AHAS</i> allele in <i>B. napus</i> and laid a foundation for developing herbicide-resistant rapeseed cultivars.
