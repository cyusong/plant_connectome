['11283335', 'Using phragmoplastin as a bait, we isolated an Arabidopsis cDNA encoding a novel  UDP-glucose transferase (UGT1). This interaction was confirmed by an in vitro  protein--protein interaction assay using purified UGT1 and radiolabeled  phragmoplastin. Protein gel blot results revealed that UGT1 is associated with  the membrane fraction and copurified with the product-entrapped callose synthase  complex. These data suggest that UGT1 may act as a subunit of callose synthase  that uses UDP-glucose to synthesize callose, a 1,3-beta-glucan. UGT1 also  interacted with Rop1, a Rho-like protein, and this interaction occurred only in  its GTP-bound configuration, suggesting that the plant callose synthase may be  regulated by Rop1 through the interaction with UGT1. The green fluorescent  protein--UGT1 fusion protein was located on the forming cell plate during  cytokinesis. We propose that UGT1 may transfer UDP-glucose from sucrose synthase  to the callose synthase and thus help form a substrate channel for the synthesis  of callose at the forming cell plate.', '2001 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.13.4.769', 'Verma']
