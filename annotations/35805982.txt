<i>VIVIPAROUS1/ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1</i> (<i>VAL1</i>) encodes a DNA-binding B3 domain protein and plays essential roles in seed maturation and flowering transition by repressing genes through epigenetic silencing in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. <i>SWI-INDEPENDENT3</i> (<i>SIN3</i>)-<i>LIKEs</i> (<i>SNLs</i>), which encode scaffold proteins for the assembly of histone deacetylase complexes and have six SIN3 homologues (<i>SNL1</i><i>-SNL6</i>) in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, directly repress gene expression to regulate seed maturation and flowering transition. However, it remains unclear whether VAL1 and SNLs work together in repressing the expression of related genes. In this study, yeast two-hybrid and firefly luciferase complementation imaging assays revealed that VAL1 interacts with SNLs, which can be attributed to its own zinc-finger CW (conserved Cys (C) and Trp (W) residues) domain and the PAH (Paired Amphipathic Helices) domains of SNLs. Furthermore, pull-down experiments confirmed that the CW domain of VAL1 interacts with both intact protein and the PAH domains of SNLs proteins, and the co-immunoprecipitation assays also confirmed the interaction between VAL1 and SNLs. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that <i>VAL1</i> and <i>SNLs</i> were expressed in seedlings, and transient expression assays showed that VAL1 and SNLs were localized in the nucleus. Considered together, these results reveal that VAL1 physically interacts with SNLs both in vitro and in vivo, and suggest that VAL1 and SNLs may work together to repress the expression of genes related to seed maturation and flowering transition in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
