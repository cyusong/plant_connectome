['16244142', 'Auxin-resistant mutants have been useful for dissecting the mechanisms that  underlie auxin-mediated biological processes. Here we report the isolation and  molecular characterization of a novel auxin-resistant mutant in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana). Like known mutated AUX/IAA transcription factors, the  mutant described here displayed dominant resistance to exogenously supplied  auxins (sirtinol, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, indole-3-acetic acid) and a  host of pleiotropic phenotypes, including apical hook deformation, defects in  lateral root development, reduced stature, and homozygous lethality. This mutant  showed the same sensitivity to the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane  carboxylic acid as wild-type plants, and retained the ability to induce IAA19  expression in response to exogenously supplied indole-3-acetic acid. To our  surprise, these phenotypes were not caused by a mutation in an AUX/IAA gene, but  rather a mutation in a tRNA(ala) gene in which the anticodon was found changed  from CGC to CAC. Such a change results in a tRNA that is charged with alanine but  recognizes the second most highly used valine codon in Arabidopsis. Therefore,  the observed phenotypes are likely the composite of stochastic mutations of many  proteins, including downstream effectors.', '2005 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.068700', 'Zhao']
