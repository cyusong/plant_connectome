Auxin is widely involved in plant growth and development. However, the molecular mechanism on how auxin carries out this work is unclear. In particular, the effect of auxin on pre-mRNA post-transcriptional regulation is mostly unknown. By using a poly(A) tag (PAT) sequencing approach, mRNA alternative polyadenylation (APA) profiles after auxin treatment were revealed. We showed that hundreds of poly(A) site clusters (PACs) are affected by auxin at the transcriptome level, where auxin reduces PAC distribution in 5'-untranslated region (UTR), but increases in the 3'UTR. APA site usage frequencies of 42 genes were switched by auxin, suggesting that auxin affects the choice of poly(A) sites. Furthermore, poly(A) signal selection was altered after auxin treatment. For example, a mutant of poly(A) signal binding protein CPSF30 showed altered sensitivity to auxin treatment, indicating interactions between auxin and the poly(A) signal recognition machinery. We also found that auxin activity on lateral root development is likely mediated by altered expression of ARF7, ARF19 and IAA14 through poly(A) site switches. Our results shed light on the molecular mechanisms of auxin responses relative to its interactions with mRNA polyadenylation.
