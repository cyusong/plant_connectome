['8676868', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana biotin auxotroph biol was rendered prototrophic by  transformation with a chimeric transgene containing the Escherichia coli bio A  gene driven by a constitutive promoter. The bio A gene encodes the biotin  biosynthetic enzyme 7, 8-diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase. Unlike the  untransformed control plants, transgenic plants expressing the bacterial  transgene synthesized biotin and grew to maturity without biotin-deficiency  symptoms. These findings demonstrate that bio1/bio1 mutant plants are defective  in the gene encoding 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase.', '1996 Jun 12', 'Mol Gen Genet', '10.1007/BF02172516', 'Ward']
