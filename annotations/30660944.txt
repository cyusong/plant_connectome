The role of the cell wall in short-term Ni uptake at different solution Ni levels was investigated in mung bean (Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Inna). Both Ni-binding capacity of the CWs and roots are lower for wheat than for mung bean at all Ni levels in the solution. For both plants amounts of Ni associated with roots and root cell walls increased with Ni concentration. The contribution of CWs to Ni absorption by roots depends on Ni level in the medium and plant species. The Ni accumulated in CWs could account for total Ni content of roots (except for wheat in highest Ni treatment). Besides, mung bean plants employ the strategy of reducing Ni accumulation in the root CWs during exposure to excess but not toxic solution Ni level. According to the results, predominant Ni binding in the apoplast of mung bean and wheat roots is observed at both high and low external Ni, which suggests that apoplastic pathway is the main means of Ni transport in the root cortex of these species.
