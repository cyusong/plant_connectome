Cotton (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.) is an economically important crop grown for natural fiber and seed oil production. <i>DA1</i> is a ubiquitin receptor that determines final seed and organ size by restricting the period of cell proliferation. In the present study, we identified 7 <i>DA1-like</i> genes each in cultivated tetraploid (AADD) <i>G. hirsutum</i> and <i>G. barbadense</i>, and 4 and 3 <i>DA1-like</i> genes in their ancestral diploid <i>G. arboreum</i> (A2A2) and <i>G. raimondii</i> (D5D5), respectively. The 7 <i>GhDA1</i> genes were confirmed to be distributed on four At and three Dt subgenome chromosomes in <i>G. hirsutum</i>. <i>GhDA1-1A</i> showed a high sequence similarity to <i>AtDA1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, and they possessed the same functional domains, suggesting conserved functions. The overexpression of <i>GhDA1-1A</i> <sup><i>R</i>301<i>K</i></sup> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> significantly increased seed size and seed weight, indicating that <i>GhDA1-1A</i> is a promising target for cotton improvement. This study provides information on the molecular evolutionary properties of <i>DA1-like</i> genes in cotton, which will be useful for the genetic improvement of cotton.
