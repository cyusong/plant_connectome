Fast neutron mutagenesis of Lotus japonicus wild-type genotype Gifu resulted in the isolation of a stable mutant (FNN5-2) unable to form nitrogen-fixing nodules in symbiosis with Mesorhizobium loti, though being infected by mycorrhizal fungi. The mutation behaves as a loss-of-function recessive, and has no other apparent phenotypic effects. Molecular characterization indicates a partial loss of the lysin motif domain (LysM) type receptor kinase gene (LjNFR1). Additionally part of the LjNIN gene (encoding a putative transcription factor needed for nodulation) is also missing. Transcript levels for both genes are severely reduced. As LjNIN and LjNFR1 are in the same chromosomal region we tested whether this terminal portion is lacking. DNA polymerase chain reaction analysis confirms that genes within the relevant interval (such as LjPAL1 (encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase) and LjEIL2 (encoding an ethylene insensitive-like response regulator)) are present, suggesting that the mutational event induced by the fast neutrons was either a double hit coincidently involving two nodulation-related genes, a major genome rearrangement, or a major segmental inversion.
