['25465408', 'Membrane-delimited abscisic acid (ABA) signal transduction plays a critical role  in early ABA signaling, but the molecular mechanisms linking core signaling  components to the plasma membrane are unclear. We show that transient  calcium-dependent interactions of PYR/PYL ABA receptors with membranes are  mediated through a 10-member family of C2-domain ABA-related (CAR) proteins in  Arabidopsis thaliana. Specifically, we found that PYL4 interacted in an  ABA-independent manner with CAR1 in both the plasma membrane and nucleus of plant  cells. CAR1 belongs to a plant-specific gene family encoding CAR1 to CAR10  proteins, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation  assays showed that PYL4-CAR1 as well as other PYR/PYL-CAR pairs interacted in  plant cells. The crystal structure of CAR4 was solved, which revealed that, in  addition to a classical calcium-dependent lipid binding C2 domain, a specific CAR  signature is likely responsible for the interaction with PYR/PYL receptors and  their recruitment to phospholipid vesicles. This interaction is relevant for  PYR/PYL function and ABA signaling, since different car triple mutants affected  in CAR1, CAR4, CAR5, and CAR9 genes showed reduced sensitivity to ABA in seedling  establishment and root growth assays. In summary, we identified  PYR/PYL-interacting partners that mediate a transient Ca(2+)-dependent  interaction with phospholipid vesicles, which affects PYR/PYL subcellular  localization and positively regulates ABA signaling.', '2014 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.129973', 'Rodriguez']
