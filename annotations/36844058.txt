High-salinity and blast disease are two major stresses that cause dramatic yield loss in rice production. <i>GF14</i> (<i>14-3-3</i>) <i>genes</i> have been reported to play important role in biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. However, the roles of <i>OsGF14C</i> remain unknown. To understand the functions and regulatory mechanisms of <i>OsGF14C</i> in regulating salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice, we have conducted <i>OsGF14C</i>-overexpressing transgenic experiments in the present study. Our results showed that overexpression of <i>OsGF14C</i> enhanced salinity tolerance but reduced blast resistance in rice. The enhanced salinity tolerance is related to the reduction of methylglyoxal and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake instead of exclusion or compartmentation and the negative role of <i>OsGF14C</i> in blast resistance is associated with the suppression of <i>OsGF14E</i>, <i>OsGF14F</i> and <i>PR</i> genes. Our results together with the results from the previous studies suggest that the lipoxygenase gene <i>LOX2</i> which is regulated by <i>OsGF14C</i> may play roles in coordinating salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice. The current study for the first time revealed the possible roles of <i>OsGF14C</i> in regulating salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice, and laid down a foundation for further functional study and crosstalk regulation between salinity and blast resistance in rice.
