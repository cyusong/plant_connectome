Fatty acyl reductases (FARs) catalyse the reduction of fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) or -acyl carrier protein (ACP) substrates to primary fatty alcohols, which play essential roles in lipid metabolism in plants. However, the mechanism by which FARs are involved in male reproduction is poorly defined. Here, we found that two maize allelic mutants, ms25-6065 and ms25-6057, displayed defective anther cuticles, abnormal Ubisch body formation, impaired pollen exine formation and complete male sterility. Based on map-based cloning and CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, Zm00001d048337 was identified as ZmMs25, encoding a plastid-localized FAR with catalytic activities to multiple acyl-CoA substrates in vitro. Four conserved residues (G101, G104, Y327 and K331) of ZmMs25 were critical for its activity. ZmMs25 was predominantly expressed in anther, and was directly regulated by transcription factor ZmMYB84. Lipidomics analysis revealed that ms25 mutation had significant effects on reducing cutin monomers and internal lipids, and altering the composition of cuticular wax in anthers. Moreover, loss of function of ZmMs25 significantly affected the expression of its four paralogous genes and five cloned lipid metabolic male-sterility genes in maize. These data suggest that ZmMs25 is required for anther development and male fertility, indicating its application potential in maize and other crops.
