Our recent work used novel methods to localize and track discrete vesicle populations in pollen tubes undergoing oscillatory growth. The results show that clathrin-dependent endocytosis occurs along the shank of the pollen tube, smooth vesicle endocytosis occurs at the tip, and exocytosis occurs in the subapical region. Here, growth of tobacco and lily pollen tubes is examined in greater temporal resolution using refraction-free high-resolution time-lapse differential interference contrast microscopy. Images were collected at 0.21 s intervals for 10 min, sequentially examined for millisecond details, compressed into video format and then examined for details of growth dynamics. The subapical growth zone is structurally fluid, with vesicle insertion into the plasma membrane, construction of new cell surface and cellular expansion. Incorporation of new membrane and wall materials causes localized disruption at the cell surface that precedes the start of the growth cycle by 3.44 +/- 0.39 s in tobacco, and 1.02 +/- 0.01 s in lily pollen tubes. Vesicle deposition increases after the start of the growth cycle and supports expansion of the growth zone. Growth reorientation involves a shift in the position and angle of the growth zone. In summary, these results support a new model of pollen tube growth.
