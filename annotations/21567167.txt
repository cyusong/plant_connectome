By means of an RT-PCR approach we isolated a specific tyrosine phosphatase (FsPTP1) induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and correlated with seed dormancy in Fagus sylvatica seeds. To provide genetic evidence of FsPTP1 function in seed dormancy and ABA signal transduction pathway, we overexpressed this gene in Cape Verde Island ecotype of Arabidopsis thaliana, which shows the deepest degree of seed dormancy among Arabidopsis accessions. As a result, 35S:FsPTP1 transgenic seeds showed a reduced dormancy and insensitivity to ABA and osmotic stress conditions accompanied by a reduction in the level of expression of RAB18 and RD29, well-known ABA-responsive genes. Taken together, all these data are consistent with a role of this tyrosine phosphatase as a negative regulator of ABA signaling. In addition, phenotypes of FsPTP1 transgenic plants resemble those observed in ethylene constitutive mutants, accompanied by an increase in the level of expression of a key gene involved in ethylene signaling such as EIN2. All the data presented along the paper suggest that the effect of tyrosine phosphatases in ABA action during the transition from seed dormancy to germination may be through modulation of ethylene signaling.
