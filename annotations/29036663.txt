Despite the long-established importance of salicylic acid (SA) in plant stress responses and other biological processes, its biosynthetic pathways have not been fully characterized. The proposed synthesis of SA originates from chorismate by two distinct pathways: the isochorismate and phenylalanine (Phe) ammonia-lyase (PAL) pathways. Cyanogenesis is the process related to the release of hydrogen cyanide from endogenous cyanogenic glycosides (CNglcs), and it has been linked to plant plasticity improvement. To date, however, no relationship has been suggested between the two pathways. In this work, by metabolomics and biochemical approaches (including the use of [13C]-labeled compounds), we provide strong evidences showing that CNglcs turnover is involved, at least in part, in SA biosynthesis in peach plants under control and stress conditions. The main CNglcs in peach are prunasin and amygdalin, with mandelonitrile (MD), synthesized from phenylalanine, controlling their turnover. In peach plants MD is the intermediary molecule of the suggested new SA biosynthetic pathway and CNglcs turnover, regulating the biosynthesis of both amygdalin and SA. MD-treated peach plants displayed increased SA levels via benzoic acid (one of the SA precursors within the PAL pathway). MD also provided partial protection against Plum pox virus infection in peach seedlings. Thus, we propose a third pathway, an alternative to the PAL pathway, for SA synthesis in peach plants.
