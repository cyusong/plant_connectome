['14871309', 'Light regulates plant growth and development through a network of endogenous  factors. By screening Arabidopsis activation-tagged lines, we isolated a dominant  mutant (light-dependent short hypocotyls 1-D (lsh1-D)) that showed hypersensitive  responses to continuous red (cR), far-red (cFR) and blue (cB) light and cloned  the corresponding gene, LSH1. LSH1 encodes a nuclear protein of a novel gene  family that has homologues in Arabidopsis and rice. The effects of the lsh1-D  mutation were tested in a series of photoreceptor mutant backgrounds. The  hypersensitivity to cFR and cB light conferred by lsh1-D was abolished in a phyA  null background (phyA-201), and the hypersensitivity to cR and cFR light  conferred by lsh1-D was much reduced in the phytochrome-chromophore synthetic  mutant, hy1-1 (long hypocotyl 1). These results indicate that LSH1 is  functionally dependent on phytochrome to mediate light regulation of seedling  development.', '2004 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313x.2003.01993.x', 'Matsui']
