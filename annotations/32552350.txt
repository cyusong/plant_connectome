<i>Paraphaeosphaeria</i> genus includes plant pathogens or biocontrol agents as well as bioremediators and endophytic fungi. <i>Paraphaeosphaeria sporulosa</i> 10515 was isolated in 2013 as an endophyte of <i>Festuca</i> spp. collected on Mount Etna at 1,832 meters above sea level. Here, we present the first-draft whole-genome sequence of a <i>P. sporulosa</i> endophytic isolate. This data will be useful for future research on understanding the genetic bases of endophytism.
