Plants remodel their cells through the dynamic endomembrane system. Intracellular pH is important for membrane trafficking, but the determinants of pH homeostasis are poorly defined in plants. Electrogenic proton (H<sup>+</sup>) pumps depend on counter-ion fluxes to establish transmembrane pH gradients at the plasma membrane and endomembranes. Vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated acidification of the trans-Golgi network is crucial for secretion and membrane recycling. Pump and counter-ion fluxes are unlikely to fine-tune pH; rather, alkali cation/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters, which can alter pH and/or cation homeostasis locally and transiently, are prime candidates. Plants have a large family of predicted cation/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers (CHX) of obscure function, in addition to the well-studied K<sup>+</sup>(Na<sup>+</sup>)/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers (NHX). Here, we review the regulation of cytosolic and vacuolar pH, highlighting the similarities and distinctions of NHX and CHX members. In planta, alkalinization of the trans-Golgi network or vacuole by NHXs promotes membrane trafficking, endocytosis, cell expansion, and growth. CHXs localize to endomembranes and/or the plasma membrane and contribute to male fertility, pollen tube guidance, pollen wall construction, stomatal opening, and, in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), tolerance to salt stress. Three-dimensional structural models and mutagenesis of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genes have allowed us to infer that AtCHX17 and AtNHX1 share a global architecture and a translocation core like bacterial Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters. Yet, the presence of distinct residues suggests that some CHXs differ from NHXs in pH sensing and electrogenicity. How H<sup>+</sup> pumps, counter-ion fluxes, and cation/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters are linked with signaling and membrane trafficking to remodel membranes and cell walls awaits further investigation.
