['9649505', 'The epidermis of Arabidopsis wild-type primary roots, in which some cells grow  hairs and others remain hairless in a position-dependent manner, has become an  established model system to study cell differentiation. Here we present a  molecular analysis of the RHL1 (ROOT HAIRLESS 1) gene that, if mutated, prevents  the formation of hairs on primary roots and causes a seedling lethal phenotype.  We have cloned the RHL1 gene by use of a T-DNA-tagged mutant and found that it  encodes a protein that appears to be plant specific. The predicted RHL1 gene  product is a small hydrophilic protein (38.9 kD) containing putative nuclear  localization signals and shows no significant homology to any known amino acid  sequence. We demonstrate that a 78-amino-acid sequence at its amino terminus is  capable of directing an RHL1-GFP fusion protein to the nucleus. The RHL1  transcript is present throughout the wild-type plant and in suspension culture  cells, but in very low amounts, suggesting a regulatory function for the RHL1  protein. Structural evidence suggests a role for the RHL1 gene product in the  nucleolus. We have examined the genetic relationship between RHL1 and GL2, an  inhibitor of root hair initiation in non-hair cells. Our molecular and genetic  data with double mutants, together with the expression analysis of a GL2  promoter-GUS reporter gene construct, indicate that the RHL1 gene acts  independently of GL2.', '1998 Jul 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.12.13.2013', 'Roberts']
