The chloroplast is essential for plant photosynthesis and production, but the regulatory mechanism of chloroplast development is still elusive. Here, a novel gene, WHITE TO GREEN1 (WTG1), was identified to have a function in chloroplast development and plastid gene expression by screening Arabidopsis leaf coloration mutants. WTG1 encodes a chloroplast-localized tetratricopeptide repeat protein that is expressed widely in Arabidopsis cells. Disruption of WTG1 suppresses plant growth, retards leaf greening and chloroplast development, and represses photosynthetic gene expression, but complemented expression of WTG1 restored a normal phenotype. Moreover, WTG1 protein is associated with the organelle RNA editing factors MORF8 and MORF9, and RNA editing of the plastid petL-5 and ndhG-50 transcripts was affected in wtg1 mutants. These results indicate that WTG1 affects both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of plastid gene expression, and provide evidence for the involvement of a tetratricopeptide repeat protein in chloroplast RNA editing in Arabidopsis.
