['9414551', 'The biotin carboxylase subunit of the heteromeric chloroplastic acetyl-coenzyme A  carboxylase (ACCase) of Arabidopsis thaliana is coded by a single gene (CAC2),  which is interrupted by 15 introns. The cDNA encodes a deduced protein of 537  amino acids with an apparent N-terminal chloroplast-targeting transit peptide.  Antibodies generated to a glutathione S-transferase-CAC2 fusion protein react  solely with a 51-kD polypeptide of Arabidopsis; these antibodies also inhibit  ACCase activity in extracts of Arabidopsis. The entire CAC2 cDNA sequence was  expressed in Escherichia coli and the resulting recombinant biotin carboxylase  was enzymatically active in carboxylating free biotin. The catalytic properties  of the recombinant biotin carboxylase indicate that the activity of the  heteromeric ACCase may be regulated by light-/dark-induced changes in stromal pH.  The CAC2 gene is maximally expressed in organs and tissues that are actively  synthesizing fatty acids for membrane lipids or oil deposition. The observed  expression pattern of CAC2 mirrors that previously reported for the CAC1 gene  (J.-K. Choi, F. Yu, E.S. Wurtele, B.J. Nikolau [1995] Plant Physiol 109: 619-625;  J. Ke, J.-K. Choi, M. Smith, H.T. Horner, B.J. Nikolau, E.S. Wurtele [1997] Plant  Physiol 113: 357-365), which codes for the biotin carboxyl carrier subunit of the  heteromeric ACCase. This coordination is probably partially established by  coordinate transcription of the two genes. This hypothesis is consistent with the  finding that the CAC2 and CAC1 gene promoters share a common set of sequence  motifs that may be important in guiding the transcription of these genes.', '1997 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.115.4.1371', 'Wurtele']
