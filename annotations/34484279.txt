Phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) impact alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.) performance, but how these nutrients alter taproot physiology during fall acclimation and subsequent growth in spring is unclear. Our objectives were to: (1) determine seasonal patterns for taproot P and K concentrations during fall acclimation and during initial shoot growth in spring; (2) determine how P and K nutrition impacts accumulation of taproot C and N reserves during fall and their subsequent use when shoot growth resumes in spring; and (3) assess how addition of P and K fertilizer impacts survival and shoot growth in spring. Two P (0 and 75 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) and two K (0 and 400 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) treatments were applied and taproots were sampled between September and December, and again from March to May over 2 years. Concentrations of taproot sugar, starch, buffer-soluble protein, amino-N, and RNA pools were determined. While P and K fertilizer application increased taproot P and K concentrations two- to three-fold, concentrations of P and K in taproots over time did not change markedly during cold acclimation in fall, however, taproot P declined in spring as plant growth resumed. Compared to the 0K-0P treatment, taproots of plants fertilized with 400K-75P had higher starch, protein, amino-N, and RNA, but reduced sugar concentrations in fall. Concentrations of all these pools, except starch, declined during the initial 2 weeks of sampling beginning in late March as shoot growth resumed in spring. Herbage yield in May was highest for the 400K-75P treatment and least for the 0K-0P treatment, differences that were associated with variation in mass shoot<sup>-1</sup> and not shoots m<sup>-2</sup>. High yield of the 400K-75P plants in May was consistently associated with greater concentrations and use of amino-N, soluble protein, and RNA pools in taproots, and not with accumulation and use of starch and sugar pools. Understanding factors leading to the accumulation of taproot N reserves and RNA during cold acclimation in fall and their use during the initial growth in spring should enhance efforts to improve alfalfa growth and herbage yield in spring.
