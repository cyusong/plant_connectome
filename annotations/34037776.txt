Root length is an important root parameter directly related to the uptake of water and nutrients. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling root length are still not fully understood. Here, we isolated a short-root mutant of rice, dice2 (defective in cell elongation 2). The cell length and meristem size of the roots were decreased in dice2, but the root function in terms of mineral element uptake, root cell width, and root anatomy were hardly altered compared with wild-type (WT) rice. The root growth defect in dice2 could be partially rescued by high temperature. Map-based cloning combined with a complementation test revealed that the short-root phenotype was caused by a nonsense mutation in a gene which was annotated to encode Lysine Ketoglutarate Reductase Trans-Splicing related 1 (OsLKRT1). OsLKRT1, encoding a cytosol-localized protein, was expressed in all cells of the root tip and elongation region as well as the shoot. RNA-seq analysis showed that there was no difference between dice2 and the WT in the expression level of genes involved in root development identified so far. These results indicate that OsLKRT1 is involved in a novel pathway required for root cell elongation in rice, although its exact role remains to be further investigated.
