['10850495', 'Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants resuits from the degradation  of mRNAs and shows phenomenological similarities with quelling in fungi and RNAi  in animals. Here, we report the isolation of sgs2 and sgs3 Arabidopsis mutants  impaired in PTGS. We establish a mechanistic link between PTGS, quelling, and  RNAi since the Arabidopsis SGS2 protein is similar to an RNA-dependent RNA  polymerase like N. crassa QDE-1, controlling quelling, and C. elegans EGO-1,  controlling RNAi. In contrast, SGS3 shows no significant similarity with any  known or putative protein, thus defining a specific step of PTGS in plants. Both  sgs2 and sgs3 mutants show enhanced susceptibility to virus, definitively proving  that PTGS is an antiviral defense mechanism that can also target transgene RNA  for degradation.', '2000 May 26', 'Cell', '10.1016/s0092-8674(00)80863-6', 'Vaucheret']
