The functions of dicot sucrose transporters (SUTs) in apoplastic phloem loading of sucrose are well established; however, whether SUTs similarly function in monocots was unresolved. To address this question, we recently provided genetic evidence that ZmSUT1 from maize (Zea mays) is required for efficient phloem loading. sut1-m1 mutant plants hyperaccumulate carbohydrates in leaves, are defective in loading sucrose into the phloem, and have altered biomass partitioning. Presumably due to the hyperaccumulation of soluble sugars in leaves, mutations in ZmSUT1 lead to downregulation of chlorophyll accumulation, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. However, because we had identified only a single mutant allele, we were not able to exclude the possibility that the mutant phenotypes were instead caused by a closely linked mutation. Based on a novel aspect of the sut1 mutant phenotype, secretion of a concentrated sugar solution from leaf hydathodes, we identified an additional mutant allele, sut1-m4. This confirms that the mutation of SUT1 is responsible for the impairment in phloem loading. In addition, the sut1-m4 mutant does not accumulate transcripts, supporting the findings reported previously that the original mutant allele is also a null mutation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that ZmSUT1 functions to phloem load sucrose in maize leaves.
