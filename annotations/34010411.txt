['34010411', 'Phosphoinositides are low-abundant lipids that participate in the acquisition of  membrane identity through their spatiotemporal enrichment in specific  compartments. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) accumulates at the plant  plasma membrane driving its high electrostatic potential, and thereby  facilitating interactions with polybasic regions of proteins. PI4Kalpha1 has been  suggested to produce PI4P at the plasma membrane, but how it is recruited to this  compartment is unknown. Here, we pin-point the mechanism that tethers Arabidopsis  thaliana phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha1 (PI4Kalpha1) to the plasma membrane via  a nanodomain-anchored scaffolding complex. We established that PI4Kalpha1 is part of  a complex composed of proteins from the NO-POLLEN-GERMINATION, EFR3-OF-PLANTS,  and HYCCIN-CONTAINING families. Comprehensive knockout and knockdown strategies  revealed that subunits of the PI4Kalpha1 complex are essential for pollen, embryonic,  and post-embryonic development. We further found that the PI4Kalpha1 complex is  immobilized in plasma membrane nanodomains. Using synthetic mis-targeting  strategies, we demonstrate that a combination of lipid anchoring and scaffolding  localizes PI4Kalpha1 to the plasma membrane, which is essential for its function.  Together, this work opens perspectives on the mechanisms and function of plasma  membrane nanopatterning by lipid kinases.', '2022 Jan 20', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab135', 'ORCID:']
