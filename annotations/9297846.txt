['9297846', 'In higher plants, shoots show negative gravitropism and roots show positive  gravitropism. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of root and hypocotyl  gravitropism, we segregated the second mutation from the original phyB-1 mutant  line which impaired both root and hypocotyl gravitropism and characterized this  novel mutation named rhg (for root and hypocotyl gravitropism). The rhg is a  single recessive nuclear mutation and it is mapped on the lower part of the  chromosome 1. Analyses on the gravitropic responses of the rhg mutant indicate  that root and hypocotyl gravitropism are severely impaired but inflorescence stem  gravitropism is not affected by the rhg mutation. In the rhg mutant seedlings,  amyloplasts (statoliths for gravity-perception) were present in the presumptive  statocytes of roots and hypocotyls. Phototropism by roots and hypocotyls was not  impaired in the rhg mutant. These results suggest that the RHG gene product  probably acts on the gravity-perception and/or the gravity-signal transduction in  root and hypocotyl gravitropism. This is the first report about the genetic locus  specifically involved in both root and hypocotyl gravitropism but not  inflorescence stem gravitropism, supporting our hypothesis that the mechanisms of  gravitropism are genetically different between hypocotyls and inflorescence  stems.', '1997 Jul', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029238', 'Tasaka']
