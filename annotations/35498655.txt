The methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway is responsible for providing common precursors for the biosynthesis of diverse plastidial terpenoids, including chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phytohormones, in plants. In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the last-step genes encoding 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase [HDR/isoprenoid synthesis H (IspH)] have been annotated in two genes (<i>OsIspH1</i> and <i>OsIspH2</i>) in the rice genome. The spatial transcript levels indicated that <i>OsIspH1</i> is highly expressed in all tissues at different developmental stages, whereas <i>OsIspH2</i> is barely expressed due to an early stop in exon 1 caused by splicing error. OsIspH1 localized into plastids and <i>osisph1</i>, a T-DNA inserted knockout mutant, showed an albino phenotype, indicating that <i>OsIspH1</i> is the only functional gene. To elucidate the role of <i>OsIspH1</i> in the MEP pathway, we created two single (H145P and K407R) and double (H145P/K407R) mutations and performed complementation tests in two <i>hdr</i> mutants, including <i>Escherichia coli</i> DLYT1 strains and <i>osisph1</i> rice plants. The results showed that every single mutation retained HDR function, but a double mutation lost it, proposing that the complementary relations of two residues might be important for enzyme activity but not each residue. When overexpressed in rice plants, the double-mutated gene, <i>OsIspH1<sup>MUT</sup></i> , reduced chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis in the leaves and seeds. It confirmed the crucial role of <i>OsIspH1</i> in plastidic terpenoid biosynthesis, revealing organ-specific differential regulation of <i>OsIspH1</i> in rice plants.
