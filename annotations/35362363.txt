WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 5 (WOX5) is a member of the WUSCHEL (WUS) homeodomain transcription factor family. <i>WOX5</i> is expressed mainly in the quiescent center (QC) and confers stem cell identity in the root apical meristem (RAM). Consistent with the role of <i>WUS</i> in repressing root meristem development, we found that ectopic expression of <i>WOX5</i> disrupted shoot development by repressing shoot-related genes, such as <i>YABBY1</i> (<i>YAB1</i>). Our findings suggest that WOX5 and WUS potentially confer different tissue identities and specify RAM and SAM, respectively.

WOX5: !confers! stem cell identity 
WOX5: !represses! shoot-related genes 
WUS: !specifies! RAM 
WUS: !specifies! SAM
