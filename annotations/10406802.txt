['10406802', 'Cellular functions require adequate homeostasis of several divalent metal  cations, including Mg(2+) and Zn(2+). Mg(2+), the most abundant free divalent  cytoplasmic cation, is essential for many enzymatic reactions, while Zn(2+) is a  structural constituent of various enzymes. Multicellular organisms have to  balance not only the intake of Mg(2+) and Zn(2+), but also the distribution of  these ions to various organs. To date, genes encoding Mg(2+) transport proteins  have not been cloned from any multicellular organism. We report here the cloning  and characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana transporter, designated AtMHX,  which is localized in the vacuolar membrane and functions as an electrogenic  exchanger of protons with Mg(2+) and Zn(2+) ions. Functional homologs of AtMHX  have not been cloned from any organism. Ectopic overexpression of AtMHX in  transgenic tobacco plants render them sensitive to growth on media containing  elevated levels of Mg(2+) or Zn(2+), but does not affect the total amounts of  these minerals in shoots of the transgenic plants. AtMHX mRNA is mainly found at  the vascular cylinder, and a large proportion of the mRNA is localized in close  association with the xylem tracheary elements. This localization suggests that  AtMHX may control the partitioning of Mg(2+) and Zn(2+) between the various plant  organs.', '1999 Jul 15', 'EMBO J', '10.1093/emboj/18.14.3973', 'Galili']
