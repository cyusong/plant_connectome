Plant pathogen effectors play important roles in parasitism, including countering plant immunity. However, investigations of the emergence and diversification of fungal effectors across host-adapted populations has been limited. We previously identified a gene encoding a suppressor of plant cell death in <i>Pyricularia oryzae</i> (syn. <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>). Here, we report the gene is one of a 21-member gene family and we characterize sequence diversity in different populations. Within the rice pathogen population, nucleotide diversity is low, however; the majority of gene family members display presence-absence polymorphism or other null alleles. Gene family allelic diversity is greater between host-adapted populations and, thus, we named them host-adapted genes (<i>HAGs</i>). Multiple copies of <i>HAGs</i> were found in some genome assemblies and sequence divergence between the alleles in two cases suggested they were the result of repeat-induced point mutagenesis. Transfer of family members between populations and novel <i>HAG</i> haplotypes resulting from apparent recombination were observed. <i>HAG</i> family transcripts were induced in planta and a subset of <i>HAG</i>s are dependent on a key regulator of pathogenesis, <i>PMK1</i>. We also found differential intron splicing for some <i>HAG</i>s that would prevent ex planta protein expression. For some genes, spliced transcript was expressed in antiphase with an overlapping antisense transcript. Characterization of <i>HAG</i> expression patterns and allelic diversity reveal novel mechanisms for <i>HAG</i> regulation and mechanisms generating sequence diversity and novel allele combinations. This evidence of strong in planta-specific expression and selection operating on the <i>HAG</i> family is suggestive of a role in parasitism.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
