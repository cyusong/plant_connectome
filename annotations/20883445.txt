An efficient protein extraction method is crucial to ensure successful separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) for recalcitrant plant species, in particular for grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). Trichloroacetic acid-acetone (TCA-acetone) and phenol extraction methods were evaluated for proteome analysis of leaves and roots from the Tunisian cultivar 'Razegui'. The phenol-based protocol proved to give a higher protein yield, a greater spot resolution, and a minimal streaking on 2-DE gels for both leaf and root tissues compared with the TCA-based protocol. Furthermore, the highest numbers of detected proteins on 2-DE gels were observed using the phenol extraction from leaves and roots as compared with TCA-acetone extraction.

Phenol extraction: !gives higher protein yield! 2-DE gels 
Phenol extraction: !greater spot resolution! 2-DE gels 
Phenol extraction: !minimal streaking! 2-DE gels 
Phenol extraction: !detects highest proteins! 2-DE gels 
TCA-acetone extraction: !detects lower proteins! 2-DE gels
