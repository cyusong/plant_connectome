['26483494', 'The iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) is an ancient and essential cofactor of many  proteins involved in electron transfer and metabolic reactions. In Arabidopsis,  three pathways exist for the maturation of iron-sulfur proteins in the cytosol,  plastids, and mitochondria. We functionally characterized the role of  mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 (GRXS15) in biogenesis of ISC containing aconitase  through a combination of genetic, physiological, and biochemical approaches. Two  Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutants were identified as null mutants with early  embryonic lethal phenotypes that could be rescued by GRXS15. Furthermore, we  showed that recombinant GRXS15 is able to coordinate and transfer an ISC and that  this coordination depends on reduced glutathione (GSH). We found the Arabidopsis  GRXS15 able to complement growth defects based on disturbed ISC protein assembly  of a yeast Deltagrx5 mutant. Modeling of GRXS15 onto the crystal structures of  related nonplant proteins highlighted amino acid residues that after mutation  diminished GSH and subsequently ISC coordination, as well as the ability to  rescue the yeast mutant. When used for plant complementation, one of these mutant  variants, GRXS15K83/A, led to severe developmental delay and a pronounced  decrease in aconitase activity by approximately 65%. These results indicate that  mitochondrial GRXS15 is an essential protein in Arabidopsis, required for full  activity of iron-sulfur proteins.', '2015 Nov 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1510835112', 'Meyer']
