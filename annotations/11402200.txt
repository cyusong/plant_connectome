['11402200', 'We identified a T-DNA-generated mutation in the chaperonin-60alpha gene of  Arabidopsis that produces a defect in embryo development. The mutation, termed  schlepperless (slp), causes retardation of embryo development before the heart  stage, even though embryo morphology remains normal. Beyond the heart stage, the  slp mutation results in defective embryos with highly reduced cotyledons. slp  embryos exhibit a normal apical-basal pattern and radial tissue organization, but  they are morphologically retarded. Even though slp embryos are competent to  transcribe two late-maturation gene markers, this competence is acquired more  slowly as compared with wild-type embryos. slp embryos also exhibit a defect in  plastid development-they remain white during maturation in planta and in culture.  Hence, the overall developmental phenotype of the slp mutant reflects a lesion in  the chloroplast that affects embryo development. The slp phenotype highlights the  importance of the chaperonin-60alpha protein for chloroplast development and  subsequently for the proper development of the plant embryo and seedling.', '2001 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.126.2.717', 'Goldberg']
