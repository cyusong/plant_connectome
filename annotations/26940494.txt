['26940494', "Block of cell proliferation (BOP) proteins are conserved among eukaryotes, and  studies in mammals and yeast have described their role in ribosome biogenesis and  cell cycle regulation. A BOP1 orthologue was identified in plants, and  loss-of-function analyses in tobacco cells confirmed similar activities. This  report characterizes a role for BOP1 activity in planta. Two transgenic plant  species were used: the diploid strawberry (Fragaria vesca) and Arabidopsis  thaliana. FvBOP1 silencing showed changes in pre-rRNA processing, and  demonstrated FvBOP1's role in growth and physiology throughout different stages  of plant development. In the strawberry, repression of FvBOP1 activity decreased  plant fitness prior to flowering, followed by plant death after the reproductive  transition, indicating that BOP1 activity is required for transition back to  vegetative growth after flowering. A T-DNA null allele of the AtBOP1 gene is  lethal, and a 50% decrease in transcript accumulation is sufficient to cause  severe developmental defects linked to defective cell division. The conserved  protein BOP1 is essential for viability. Lower transcript levels result in  defects in rRNA processing and developmental abnormalities that are consistent  with its predicted role in ribosome biogenesis.", '2016 Apr', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2016.01.002', 'Folta']
