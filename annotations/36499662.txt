To avoid the activation of plant defenses and ensure sustained feeding, aphids are assumed to use their mouthparts to deliver effectors into plant cells. A recent study has shown that effectors detected near feeding sites are differentially distributed in plant tissues. However, the precise process of effector delivery into specific plant compartments is unknown. The acrostyle, a cuticular organ located at the tip of maxillary stylets that transiently binds plant viruses via its stylin proteins, may participate in this specific delivery process. Here, we demonstrate that Mp10, a saliva effector released into the plant cytoplasm during aphid probing, binds to the acrostyles of <i>Acyrthosiphon pisum</i> and <i>Myzus persicae</i>. The effector probably interacts with Stylin-03 as a lowered Mp10-binding to the acrostyle was observed upon RNAi-mediated reduction in Stylin-03 production. In addition, Stylin-03 and Stylin-01 RNAi aphids exhibited changes in their feeding behavior as evidenced by electrical penetration graph experiments showing longer aphid probing behaviors associated with watery saliva release into the cytoplasm of plant cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the acrostyle also has effector binding capacity and supports its role in the delivery of aphid effectors into plant cells.
