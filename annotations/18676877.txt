Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) oxidizes, reduces, and isomerizes disulfide bonds, modulates redox responses, and chaperones proteins. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 12 PDI genes, but little is known about their subcellular locations and functions. We demonstrate that PDI5 is expressed in endothelial cells about to undergo programmed cell death (PCD) in developing seeds. PDI5 interacts with three different Cys proteases in yeast two-hybrid screens. One of these traffics together with PDI5 from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi to vacuoles, and its recombinant form is functionally inhibited by recombinant PDI5 in vitro. Peak PDI5 expression in endothelial cells precedes PCD, whereas decreasing PDI5 levels coincide with the onset of PCD-related cellular changes, such as enlargement and subsequent collapse of protein storage vacuoles, lytic vacuole shrinkage and degradation, and nuclear condensation and fragmentation. Loss of PDI5 function leads to premature initiation of PCD during embryogenesis and to fewer, often nonviable, seeds. We propose that PDI5 is required for proper seed development and regulates the timing of PCD by chaperoning and inhibiting Cys proteases during their trafficking to vacuoles before PCD of the endothelial cells. During this transitional phase of endothelial cell development, the protein storage vacuoles become the de facto lytic vacuoles that mediate PCD.
