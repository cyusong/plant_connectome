Considerable progress has been made in understanding the function of receptor-like kinase (RLK) genes in model plants. However, much less is known about these genes in crop species. Here we report the characterization of three new wheat RLK genes (TaRLK-R1, 2 and 3). The primary structure of the putative proteins TaRLK-R1, 2 and 3 contained a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a predicted intracellular kinase domain. The fusions between TaRLK-R1, 2 or 3 and the green fluorescence protein (GFP) were targeted to the plasma membrane; such targeting required the signal peptide, extracellular domain and transmembrane domain. Transcription of TaRLK-R1, 2 and 3 was found mainly in the green organs, and was regulated by light. Transcript levels of TaRLK-R1, 2 and 3 increased during the hypersensitive reaction (HR) to stripe rust fungus. In addition, the TaRLK-R3 transcript level was also upregulated by abiotic stresses. Further experiments revealed that the recombinant kinase domain of TaRLK-R3 exhibited auto-phosphorylation activity in vitro. Knocking down the transcript levels of TaRLK-R1, 2 or 3 individually or all together by virus-induced gene silencing compromised the wheat HR to stripe rust fungus. The demonstration of TaRLK-R1, 2 and 3 as positive contributors in the wheat HR to stripe rust fungus suggests a new direction for further functional studies of this important family of RLK genes, and may facilitate the breeding of wheat varieties resistant to stripe rust disease.
