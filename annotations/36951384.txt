In the cytosol of plant cells, heat-induced protein aggregates are resolved by ClpB/Hsp100 family member HSP101, which is essential for thermotolerance. For chloroplast family member CLPB3 this is less clear with controversial reports on its role in conferring thermotolerance. To shed light onto this issue, we have characterized two clpb3 mutants in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We show that chloroplast CLPB3 is required for resolving heat-induced protein aggregates containing stromal TIG1 and the small heat shock proteins HSP22E/F in vivo and for conferring thermotolerance under heat stress. Although CLPB3 accumulates to similarly high levels as stromal HSP70B under ambient conditions, we observed no prominent constitutive phenotypes. However, we found decreased accumulation of the ribosomal subunit PRPL1 and increased accumulation of the stromal protease DEG1C in the clpb3 mutants, suggesting that reduction in chloroplast protein synthesis capacity and increase in proteolytic capacity may compensate for loss of CLPB3 function. Under ambient conditions, CLPB3 was distributed throughout the chloroplast but reorganized into stromal foci upon heat stress, which mostly disappeared during recovery. CLPB3 foci were localized next to HSP22E/F, which accumulated largely to the thylakoid membrane occupied area. This suggests a possible role for CLPB3 in disentangling protein aggregates from the thylakoid membrane system.
