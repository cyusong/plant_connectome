In plants, priming allows a more rapid and robust response to recurring stresses. However, while the nature of plant response to a single stress can affect the subsequent response to the same stress has been deeply studied, considerably less is known on how the priming effect due to one stress can help plants cope with subsequent different stresses, a situation that can be found in natural ecosystems. Here, we investigate the potential priming effects in <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants subjected to a high light (HL) stress followed by a drought (D) stress. The cross-stress tolerance was assessed at the physiological and molecular levels. Our data demonstrated that HL mediated transcriptional priming on the expression of specific stress response genes. Furthermore, this priming effect involves both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent responses, as also supported by reduced expression of these genes in the <i>aba1-3</i> mutant compared to the wild type. We have also assessed several physiological parameters with the aim of seeing if gene expression coincides with any physiological changes. Overall, the results from the physiological measurements suggested that these physiological processes did not experience metabolic changes in response to the stresses. In addition, we show that the H3K4me3 epigenetic mark could be a good candidate as an epigenetic mark in priming response. Overall, our results help to elucidate how HL-mediated priming can limit D-stress and enhance plant responses to stress.
