Regulated gene expression is an important mechanism for controlling ectomycorrhizal symbiosis development. This study aimed to elucidate the coordination between development of mycorrhiza and the differential gene expression in both partners. We analysed RNA levels from sequential samples of symbiotic tissues of Eucalyptus globulus bicostata and the basidiomycete Pisolithus microcarpus progressing through ectomycorrhiza development using cDNA arrays. We derived groups of coordinately expressed genes using hierarchical and nonhierarchical clustering algorithms. Five major distinct temporal patterns of induction/repression were observed with distinct groups of early, middle-, and late-transcriptionally responsive genes to symbiosis formation. At earliest stages, the differentially expressed fungal genes included cell wall symbiosis-regulated proteins, hydrophobins and mannoproteins, whereas transcripts coding for defense-related proteins were upregulated in plant tissues. Middle- and late-transcriptionally responsive genes coded enzymes of glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid biosynthesis, as well as protein synthesis, hormone metabolism and signal transduction components. This investigation confirms and extends earlier results which found that changes in morphology associated with mycorrhizal development were accompanied by changes in transcript patterns, but no ectomycorrhiza-specific genes were detected.
