['33404548', 'The genetic identities of Ca(2+) channels in root hair (RH) tips essential for  constitutive RH growth have remained elusive for decades. Here, we report the  identification and characterization of three cyclic nucleotide-gated channel  (CNGC) family members, CNGC5, CNGC6, and CNGC9, as Ca(2+) channels essential for  constitutive RH growth in Arabidopsis. We found that the cngc5-1cngc6-2cngc9-1  triple mutant (designated shrh1) showed significantly shorter and branching RH  phenotypes as compared with the wild type. The defective RH growth phenotype of  shrh1 could be rescued by either the expression of CNGC5, CNGC6, or CNGC9 single  gene or by the supply of high external Ca(2+), but could not be rescued by  external K(+) supply. Cytosolic Ca(2+) imaging and patch-clamp data in HEK293T  cells showed that these three CNGCs all function as Ca(2+)-permeable channels.  Cytosolic Ca(2+) imaging in growing RHs further showed that the Ca(2+) gradients  and their oscillation in RH tips were dramatically attenuated in shrh1 compared  with those in the wild type. Phenotypic analysis revealed that these three CNGCs  are Ca(2+) channels essential for constitutive RH growth, with different roles in  RHs from the conditional player CNGC14. Moreover, we found that these three CNGCs  are involved in auxin signaling in RHs. Taken together, our study identified  CNGC5, CNGC6, and CNGC9 as three key Ca(2+) channels essential for constitutive  RH growth and auxin signaling in Arabidopsis.', '2020 Jan 13', 'Plant Commun', '10.1016/j.xplc.2019.100001', 'Wang']
