Mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) is a polysaccharide that is highly abundant in grass endosperm cell walls and present at lower amounts in other tissues. <i>Cellulose synthase-like F</i> (<i>CSLF</i>) and <i>cellulose synthase-like H</i> genes synthesize MLG, but it is unknown if other genes participate in the production and restructuring of MLG. Using <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> transcriptional profiling data, we identified a <i>B</i> <i>distachyon</i> trihelix family transcription factor (<i>BdTHX1</i>) that is highly coexpressed with the <i>B</i> <i>distachyon CSLF6</i> gene (<i>BdCSLF6</i>), which suggests that BdTHX1 is involved in the regulation of MLG biosynthesis. To determine the genes regulated by this transcription factor, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments using immature <i>B</i> <i>distachyon</i> seeds and an anti-BdTHX1 polyclonal antibody. The ChIP-seq experiment identified the second intron of <i>BdCSLF6</i> as one of the most enriched sequences. The binding of BdTHX1 to the <i>BdCSLF6</i> intron sequence was confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). ChIP-seq also showed that a gene encoding a grass-specific glycoside hydrolase family 16 endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (<i>BdXTH8</i>) is bound by BdTHX1, and the binding was confirmed by EMSA. Radiochemical transglucanase assays showed that BdXTH8 exhibits predominantly MLG:xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activity, a hetero-transglycosylation reaction, and can thus produce MLG-xyloglucan covalent bonds; it also has a lower xyloglucan:xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activity. <i>B</i> <i>distachyon</i> shoots regenerated from transformed calli overexpressing <i>BdTHX1</i> showed an abnormal arrangement of vascular tissue and seedling-lethal phenotypes. These results indicate that the transcription factor BdTHX1 likely plays an important role in MLG biosynthesis and restructuring by regulating the expression of <i>BdCSLF6</i> and <i>BdXTH8</i>.
