['21441932', 'Glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is an important metabolite that contributes to the  growth and disease-related physiologies of prokaryotes, plants, animals and  humans alike. Here we show that G3P serves as the inducer of an important form of  broad-spectrum immunity in plants, termed systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SAR  is induced upon primary infection and protects distal tissues from secondary  infections. Genetic mutants defective in G3P biosynthesis cannot induce SAR but  can be rescued when G3P is supplied exogenously. Radioactive tracer experiments  show that a G3P derivative is translocated to distal tissues, and this requires  the lipid transfer protein, DIR1. Conversely, G3P is required for the  translocation of DIR1 to distal tissues, which occurs through the symplast. These  observations, along with the fact that dir1 plants accumulate reduced levels of  G3P in their petiole exudates, suggest that the cooperative interaction of DIR1  and G3P orchestrates the induction of SAR in plants.', '2011 May', 'Nat Genet', '10.1038/ng.798', 'Kachroo']
