['16989822', 'A cDNA of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii encoding a plastidial homogentisate  prenyltransferase was identified. Functional expression studies in Escherichia  coli revealed that the enzyme possessed properties similar to the  prenyltransferase of Arabidopsis thaliana encoded by At3g11950 but different from  the phytyltransferases of A. thaliana and Synechocystis. Unlike the  phytyltransferases, the C. reinhardtii and the respective A. thaliana enzyme  showed highest activities with solanesyl diphosphate, but were hardly active with  phytyl diphosphate. Hence, these data provide evidence that the latter represent  homogentisate solanesyltransferases involved in plastoquinone-9 biosynthesis.  Overexpression of At3g11950 in A. thaliana, however, suggests that the  solanesyltransferase can affect tocopherol biosynthesis as well.', '2006 Oct 2', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2006.09.002', 'Frentzen']
