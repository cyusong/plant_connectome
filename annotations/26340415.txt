The Arabidopsis vascular system is composed of xylem and phloem, which form a well-defined collateral pattern in vascular bundles. Xylary element and fibers develop secondary cell walls (SCWs) that provide mechanical strength to support plant growth and to transport water and minerals to all above ground organs. SCWs also constitute the majority of terrestrial biomass for biofuel production. The biosynthesis of secondary cell walls are known to be under transcriptional regulation. Transcription factors, such as NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) and MYB domain proteins, serve as master regulators in SCW development. Recent studies indicated that Class III homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factors (HD-ZIP III TFs) and microRNA 165/166 (miR165/166) may play important roles in SCW formation. Here we discuss the diverse functions of miR165/166 and HD-ZIPIII in vascular development and their interaction with the regulatory pathways of SCW biosynthesis.
