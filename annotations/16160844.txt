Studies of carrot embryogenesis have suggested that abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in somatic embryogenesis. A relationship between endogenous ABA and the induction of somatic embryogenesis was demonstrated using stress-induced system of somatic embryos. The embryonic-specific genes C-ABI3 and embryogenic cell proteins (ECPs) were expressed during stress treatment prior to the formation of somatic embryos. The stress-induction system for embryogenesis was clearly distinguished by two phases: the acquisition of embryogenic competence and the formation of a somatic embryo. Somatic embryo formation was inhibited by the application of fluridone (especially at 10(-4) M), a potent inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, during stress treatment. The inhibitory effect of fluridone was nullified by the simultaneous application of fluridone and ABA. The level of endogenous ABA increased transiently during stress. However, somatic embryogenesis was not significantly induced by the application of only ABA to the endogenous level, in the absence of stress. These results suggest that the induction of somatic embryogenesis, in particular the acquisition of embryogenic competence, is caused not only by the presence of ABA but also by physiological responses that are directly controlled by stresses.
