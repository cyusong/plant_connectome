['9011083', 'Dicot plant embryos undergo a transition from radial to bilateral symmetry. In  Arabidopsis, this change reflects patterning within the apical region, resulting  in the formation of the cotyledon and shoot meristem primordia. Mutations in the  GURKE gene give seedlings with highly reduced or no cotyledons. Both strong and  weak gurke alleles confer this phenotypic variability although strong alleles  often eliminate the entire apex and sometimes also part of the hypocotyl. The  root and the root meristem as well as the radial pattern of concentric tissue  layers are essentially normal. The mutant seedling phenotype can be traced back  to the triangular/early-heart stage of embryogenesis when abnormal cell divisions  occur within the apical region such that no or only rudimentary cotyledon  primordia are established. The postembryonic development of gurke seedlings was  examined in culture. In weak alleles, apical growth gave rise to abnormal leaves  and stem-like structures and, eventually, abnormal flowers. In strong alleles,  the apical region often failed to grow but occasionally produced fused leaf-like  structures with no dorso-ventral polarity and a totally unorganized vascular  system while no stems developed. The observations suggest that the GURKE gene is  involved primarily in the organization of the apical region in the embryo and may  also play a role during postembryonic development.', '1996 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1996.10061005.x', 'Jurgens']
