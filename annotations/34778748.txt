['34778748', 'Arsenic is a metalloid that is toxic to plants. Arsenate (As(V)), the prevalent  chemical form of arsenic, is a phosphate (Pi) analog and is incorporated into  plant cells via Pi transporters. Here, we found that the MYB40 transcription  factor played important roles in the control of Arabidopsis As(V) resistance. The  expression of MYB40 was induced by As(V) stress. MYB40-overexpressing lines had  an obvious As(V)-resistant phenotype and a reduced As(V)/Pi uptake rate, whereas  myb40 mutants were sensitive to As(V) stress. Upon exposure to As(V), MYB40  directly repressed the expression of PHT1;1, which encodes a main Pi transporter.  The As(V)-resistant phenotypes of MYB40-overexpressing lines were impaired by  overexpression of PHT1;1, demonstrating an epistatic genetic relationship between  MYB40 and PHT1;1. Moreover, overexpression of MYB40 enhanced, and disruption of  MYB40 reduced, thiol-peptide contents. Upon exposure to As(V), MYB40 positively  regulated the expression of PCS1, which encodes a phytochelatin synthase, and  ABCC1 and ABCC2, which encode the major vacuolar phytochelatin transporters.  Together, our data demonstrate that AtMYB40 acts as a central regulator of As(V)  responses, providing a genetic strategy for enhancing plant As(V) tolerance and  reducing As(V) uptake to improve food safety.', '2021 Nov 8', 'Plant Commun', '10.1016/j.xplc.2021.100234', 'Chen']
