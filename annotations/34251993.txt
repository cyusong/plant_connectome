Inhibition of primary root (PR) growth is a typical developmental response of Arabidopsis to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Functional disruption of SIZ1, a SUMO E3 ligase, is known to enhance the Pi deficiency-induced inhibition of PR growth. The molecular mechanism of how SIZ1 regulates PR growth under Pi deficiency, however, remains unknown. SIZ1 was recently reported to partially SUMOylate STOP1, a transcription factor that functions in plant tolerance to aluminum toxicity and in plant responses to Pi deficiency by regulating the expression of <i>ALMT1. ALMT1</i> encodes an aluminum-activated malate transporter, and its expression is induced by Pi deficiency. In <i>siz1</i>, the expression of <i>ALMT1</i> is enhanced and the removal of Fe from Pi-deficient medium suppressed the <i>siz1</i> mutant phenotype. In this report, we show that <i>siz1</i> overaccumulates Fe in its root apoplasts, and consequently, produces more hydroxyl radicals, which are detrimental to root growth. Such physiological changes in <i>siz1</i> can be completely suppressed by the mutation of <i>STOP1</i> or <i>ALMT1</i>. Based on previously published work and the results of the current study, we propose that SIZ1 regulates Pi deficiency-mediated PR growth through modulating the accumulation of Fe and the production of hydroxyl radicals by controlling <i>ALMT1</i> expression.
