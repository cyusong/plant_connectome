Plant interactions with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are highly dependent on plant genotype. Modern plant breeding has largely sought to improve crop performance but with little focus on the optimization of plant × PGPR interactions. The interactions of the model PGPR strain Pseudomonas kilonensis F113 were therefore compared in 199 ancient and modern wheat genotypes. A reporter system, in which F113 colonization and expression of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol biosynthetic genes (phl) were measured on roots was used to quantify F113 × wheat interactions under gnotobiotic conditions. Thereafter, eight wheat accessions that differed in their ability to interact with F113 were inoculated with F113 and grown in greenhouse in the absence or presence of stress. F113 colonization was linked to improved stress tolerance. Moreover, F113 colonization and phl expression were higher overall on ancient genotypes than modern genotypes. F113 colonization improved wheat performance in the four genotypes that showed the highest level of phl expression compared with the four genotypes in which phl expression was lowest. Taken together, these data suggest that recent wheat breeding strategies have had a negative impact on the ability of the plants to interact with PGPR.
