Histone modifications are essential for chromatin activity and play an important role in many biological processes. Trimethylation of histone H3K27 (H3K27me3) is a repressive modification established by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Although the presence of the histone H3 serine 28 phosphorylation (H3S28ph) modification at adjacent amino acid residues has both positive and negative effects on Polycomb silencing in mammals, little is known about the effect of H3S28ph on H3K27me3-mediated gene silencing in plants. In this study, we show that mutating H3S28A in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) causes a dominant-negative effect that leads to an early-flowering phenotype by promoting the expression of flowering-promoting genes independently of abnormal cell division. While H3S28ph levels decreased due to the H3S28A mutation, H3K27me3 levels at the same loci did not increase. Moreover, we observed decreased H3K27me3 levels at some known PRC2 target genes in H3.3S28A transgenic lines, rather than the expected enhanced H3K27me3-mediated silencing. In line with the reduced H3K27me3 levels, the expression of the PRC2 catalytic subunits CURLY LEAF and SWINGER decreased. Taken together, these data demonstrate that H3.3S28 is required for PRC2-dependent H3K27me3-mediated silencing in Arabidopsis, suggesting that H3S28 has a noncanonical function in H3K27me3-mediated gene silencing.
