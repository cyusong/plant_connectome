Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) increased the germination percentage of pea seeds, as well as the growth of seedlings in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of H(2)O(2) on seedling growth was removed by incubation with 10 microm ABA. The H(2)O(2)-pretreatment produced an increase in ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POX) and ascorbate oxidase (AAO). The increases in these ascorbate-oxidizing enzymes correlated with the increase in the growth of the pea seedlings as well as with the decrease in the redox state of ascorbate. Moreover, the increase in APX activity was due to increases in the transcript levels of cytosolic and stromal APX (cytAPX, stAPX). The proteomic analysis showed that H(2)O(2) induced proteins related to plant signalling and development, cell elongation and division, and cell cycle control. A strong correlation between the effect of H(2)O(2) on plant growth and the decreases in ABA and zeatin riboside (ZR) was observed. The results suggest an interaction among the redox state and plant hormones, orchestrated by H(2)O(2), in the induction of proteins related to plant signalling and development during the early growth of pea seedlings.
