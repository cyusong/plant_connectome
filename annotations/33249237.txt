Soybean is an important legume crop that displays the classic shade avoidance syndrome (SAS), including exaggerated stem elongation, which leads to lodging and yield reduction under density farming conditions. Here, we compared the effects of two shade signals, low red light to far-red light ratio (R:FR) and low blue light (LBL), on soybean status and revealed that LBL predominantly induces excessive stem elongation. We used CRISPR-Cas9-engineered Gmcry mutants to investigate the functions of seven cryptochromes (GmCRYs) in soybean and found that the four GmCRY1s overlap in mediating LBL-induced SAS. Light-activated GmCRY1s increase the abundance of the bZIP transcription factors STF1 and STF2, which directly upregulate the expression of genes encoding GA2 oxidases to deactivate GA<sub>1</sub> and repress stem elongation. Notably, GmCRY1b overexpression lines displayed multiple agronomic advantages over the wild-type control under both dense planting and intercropping conditions. Our study demonstrates the integration of GmCRY1-mediated signals with the GA metabolic pathway in the regulation of LBL-induced SAS in soybean. It also provides a promising option for breeding lodging-resistant, high-yield soybean cultivars in the future.
