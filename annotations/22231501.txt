There is evidence that crop yields are showing a trend of stagnation in many countries. This review aims to make an inventory of the last decade's crop productions and the associated economic and environmental challenges. Manipulating nitrogen use efficiency in crops appears to be the best way to conciliate global food security, respecting environmental policies, and the need to produce biofuels. In such a context, the specifications of ideal plants for the future are discussed with regards to human needs and taking into account current physiological and genetic knowledge. The approaches undertaken so far to design an ideal crop and to find suitable new germplasms are discussed. The interest in using model plants in agronomic research is illustrated through the recent data provided by studies exploring natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Efficient Arabidopsis ideotypes are proposed and discussed.
