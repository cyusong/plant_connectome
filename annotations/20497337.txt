*Owing to nitrogen (N) translocation towards new leaves, the shedding of old leaves can increase the whole-plant carbon gain. It occurs when their photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) declines below a given threshold. *Here, we investigated variations in net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), N resorption and PNUE in populations of Rhododendron ferrugineum presenting different mean leaf life spans (LLS). *Both populations had comparable annual leaf surface area production and A(max) across leaf-age cohorts. Branch photosynthetic capacity was up to 95% higher in the population with the longer LLS mainly because of the high contribution of old leaves to the total leaf area. Despite lower N concentrations, old leaves maintained relatively high A(max) and consequently PNUE that were higher than or similar to the values found in current-year leaves. *As the ratio of PNUE in old to PNUE in new leaves was always higher than the fraction of leaf N resorbed during leaf shedding, we concluded that leaf shedding did not improve plant photosynthetic capacity. We suggest that in R. ferrugineum, leaf shedding is mainly controlled by the leaf storage function and, therefore, that models aiming to explain LLS should not only consider the leaf carbon assimilation function, particularly in nutrient-poor habitats.

A(max): !higher in! population with longer LLS
PNUE: !higher in! old leaves
N resorption: !lower than! PNUE
leaf shedding: !controlled by! leaf storage function
