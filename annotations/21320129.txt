Photoinhibition of photosystem II (PSII) occurs when the rate of photodamage to PSII exceeds the rate of the repair of photodamaged PSII. Recent examination of photoinhibition by separate determinations of photodamage and repair has revealed that the rate of photodamage to PSII is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light and that the repair of PSII is particularly sensitive to the inactivation by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS-induced inactivation of repair is attributable to the suppression of the synthesis de novo of proteins, such as the D1 protein, that are required for the repair of PSII at the level of translational elongation. Furthermore, molecular analysis has revealed that the ROS-induced suppression of protein synthesis is associated with the specific inactivation of elongation factor G via the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond. Impairment of various mechanisms that protect PSII against photoinhibition, including photorespiration, thermal dissipation of excitation energy, and the cyclic transport of electrons, decreases the rate of repair of PSII via the suppression of protein synthesis. In this review, we present a newly established model of the mechanism and the physiological significance of repair in the regulation of the photoinhibition of PSII.
