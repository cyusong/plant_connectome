In plants, most developmental programs depend on the action of auxin. The best described model of the auxin signaling pathway, which explains most, but not all, of the auxin transcriptional responses, relies on a de-repression mechanism. The auxin/indole-3-acetic acid repressors (Aux/IAAs) interact with the auxin response factors (ARFs), the transcription factors of the auxin signaling pathway, leading to repression of the ARF-controlled genes. Auxin induces Aux/IAA degradation, releases ARFs and activates transcription. However, this elegant model is not suitable for all ARFs. Indeed, in Arabidopsis, which has 22 ARFs, only five of them fit into the model since they are the ones able to interact with Aux/IAAs. The remaining 17 have a limited capacity to interact with the repressors, and their mechanisms of action are still unclear. The differential interactions between ARF and Aux/IAA proteins constitute one of many examples of the biochemical and structural diversification of ARFs that affect their action and therefore affect auxin transcriptional responses. A deeper understanding of the structural properties of ARFs is fundamental to obtaining a better explanation of the action of auxin in plants.
