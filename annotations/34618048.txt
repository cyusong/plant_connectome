Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), the most abundant lipid in thylakoid membranes, is involved in photosynthesis and chloroplast development. MGDG lipase has an important role in lipid remodeling in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. However, the process related to turnover of the lysogalactolipid that results from MGDG degradation, monogalactosylmonoacylglycerol (MGMG), remains to be clarified. Here we identified a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) and characterized two independent knockdown (KD) alleles in C. reinhardtii. The enzyme designated as C. reinhardtiiLysolipid Acyltransferase 1 (CrLAT1) has a conserved membrane-bound O-acyl transferase domain. LPCAT from Arabidopsis has a key role in deacylation of phosphatidylcholine (PC). Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, however, lacks PC, and thus we hypothesized that CrLAT1 has some other important function in major lipid flow in this organism. In the CrLAT1 KD mutants, the amount of MGMG was increased, but triacylglycerols (TAGs) were decreased. The proportion of more saturated 18:1 (9) MGDG was lower in the KD mutants than in their parental strain, CC-4533. In contrast, the proportion of MGMG has decreased in the CrLAT1 overexpression (OE) mutants, and the proportion of 18:1 (9) MGDG was higher in the OE mutants than in the empty vector control cells. Thus, CrLAT1 is involved in the recycling of MGDG in the chloroplast and maintains lipid homeostasis in C. reinhardtii.
