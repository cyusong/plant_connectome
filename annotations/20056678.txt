['20056678', 'The problem of modulating cell fate programs to create distinct patterns and  distributions of specialized cell types in different tissues is common to complex  multicellular organisms. Here, we describe the previously uncharacterized CHALLAH  (CHAL) gene, which acts as a tissue-specific regulator of epidermal pattern in  Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis plants produce stomata, the cellular valves  required for gas exchange, in virtually all aerial organs, but stomatal density  and distribution differ among organs and along organ axes. Such regional  regulation is particularly evident in plants mutant for the putative receptor TOO  MANY MOUTHS (TMM), which produce excess stomata in leaves but no stomata in  stems. Mutations in CHAL suppress tmm phenotypes in a tissue-specific manner,  restoring stomatal production in stems while minimally affecting leaves. CHAL is  similar in sequence to the putative stomatal ligands EPF1 and EPF2 and, like the  EPFs, can reduce or eliminate stomatal production when overexpressed. However,  CHAL and the EPFs have different relationships to TMM and the ERECTA (ER) family  receptors. We propose a model in which CHAL and the EPFs both act through ER  family receptors to repress stomatal production, but are subject to opposite  regulation by TMM. The existence of two such ligand classes provides an  explanation for TMM dual functionality and tissue-specific phenotypes.', '2010 Feb', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.040931', 'Bergmann']
