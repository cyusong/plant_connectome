Experimental work has shown that Boron (i.e., Boric acid, B) is an essential and multifunctional microelement for vascular plant development. In addition to its other functions, which include xylem development and lignin biosynthesis, we now know that B is involved in phytohormone-signaling and influences the mechanical properties of intercellular pectins. From these data, we conclude that B played an important role during the evolutionary development of lignified tissues, and that it may have been involved in the evolution of vascular plant roots, as hypothesized by D. H. Lewis in 1980. Herein, we review the data pertaining to Lewis' hypothesis, present experimental results on the role of B in root (vs. rhizoid) formation in sunflower vs. a liverwort, and describe the appearance of roots in the fossil record. Open questions are addressed, notably the lack of our knowledge concerning soil microbes and their interactive roles with the micronutrient B during root formation.
