['18621945', 'Although calmodulin (CaM) is known to play multiple regulatory roles in  eukaryotes, its direct function as transcriptional regulator is unknown.  Furthermore, the physiological functions of CaM are largely unknown in plants.  Here, we show that one of the four Arabidopsis thaliana CaM isoforms, CAM7, is a  transcriptional regulator that directly interacts with the promoters of  light-inducible genes and promotes photomorphogenesis. CAM7 overexpression causes  hyperphotomorphogenic growth and an increase in the expression of light-inducible  genes. Mutations in CAM7 produce no visible effects on photomorphogenic growth,  indicating likely redundant gene functions. However, cam7 mutants display reduced  expression of light-inducible genes, and cam7 hy5 double mutants show an  enhancement of the hy5 phenotype. Moreover, overexpression of CAM7 can partly  suppress the hy5 phenotype, indicating that the two factors work together to  control light-induced seedling development. The mutational and transgenic  studies, together with physiological analyses, illustrate the concerted function  of CAM7 and HY5 basic leucine zipper transcription factor in Arabidopsis seedling  development.', '2008 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.057612', 'Chattopadhyay']
