['22540321', 'Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins belong to a family of approximately 450  members in Arabidopsis, of which few have been characterized. We identified loss  of function alleles of SLO2, defective in a PPR protein belonging to the E+  subclass of the P-L-S subfamily. slo2 mutants are characterized by retarded leaf  emergence, restricted root growth, and late flowering. This phenotype is enhanced  in the absence of sucrose, suggesting a defect in energy metabolism. The slo2  growth retardation phenotypes are largely suppressed by supplying sugars or  increasing light dosage or the concentration of CO(2). The SLO2 protein is  localized in mitochondria. We identified four RNA editing defects and reduced  editing at three sites in slo2 mutants. The resulting amino acid changes occur in  four mitochondrial proteins belonging to complex I of the electron transport  chain. Both the abundance and activity of complex I are highly reduced in the  slo2 mutants, as well as the abundance of complexes III and IV. Moreover, ATP,  NAD+, and sugar contents were much lower in the mutants. In contrast, the  abundance of alternative oxidase was significantly enhanced. We propose that SLO2  is required for carbon energy balance in Arabidopsis by maintaining the abundance  and/or activity of complexes I, III, and IV of the mitochondrial electron  transport chain.', '2012 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05036.x', 'Van']
