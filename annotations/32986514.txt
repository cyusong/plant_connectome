Sec-delivered effector 1 (SDE1) from the huanglongbing (HLB)-associated bacterium '<i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus' was previously characterized as an inhibitor of defense-related, papain-like cysteine proteases in vitro and in planta. Here, we investigated the contributions of SDE1 to HLB progression. We found that SDE1 expression in the model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> caused severe yellowing in mature leaves, reminiscent of both '<i>Ca.</i> L. asiaticus' infection symptoms and accelerated leaf senescence. Induction of senescence signatures was also observed in the SDE1-expressing <i>A. thaliana</i> lines. These signatures were apparent in older leaves but not in seedlings, suggesting an age-associated effect. Furthermore, independent lines of transgenic <i>Citrus paradisi</i> (L.) Macfadyen (Duncan grapefruit) that express <i>SDE1</i> exhibited hypersusceptibility to '<i>Ca.</i> L. asiaticus'. Similar to <i>A. thaliana</i>, transgenic citrus expressing SDE1 showed altered expression of senescence-associated genes, but only after infection with '<i>Ca.</i> L. asiaticus'. These findings suggest that SDE1 is a virulence factor that contributes to HLB progression, likely by inducing premature or accelerated senescence in citrus. This work provides new insight into HLB pathogenesis.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). This is an open access article distributed under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.
