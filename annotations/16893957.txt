In tobacco chloroplast transcripts 34 nt are efficiently edited to U. No common consensus region is present around all editing sites; however, sites can be grouped in clusters that share short common sequences. Transgene transcripts carrying either the wild-type -31/+22 or -31/+60 sequence near NTrpoB C473, an editing site within tobacco rpoB transcripts, or three different mutated sequences, were all highly edited in vivo. Endogenous transcripts of rpoB, psbL and rps14, all of which contain common sequences S1, S2 and S3 5' to NTrpoB C473, NTpsbL C2 and NTrps14 C80, were less edited in transgenic plants that over-express transcripts from NTrpoB C473 transgenes. Extent of reduction of endogenous editing differed between transgenic lines expressing mutated -31/+22 regions, depending on the abundance of the transgene transcripts. The -20/-5 sequence contains critical 5' sequence elements. Synthetic RNA templates with alterations within this 5' region were less efficiently edited in vitro than wild-type templates, by either tobacco or maize chloroplast extracts. The tobacco chloroplast extract supports both RNA editing and processing of 3' transcript termini. We conclude that within the -20/-5 region, sequences common to editing sites in the transcripts of rpoB, psbL and rps14 are critical for efficient NTrpoB C473 editing.
