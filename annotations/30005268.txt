Roots respond to a cocktail of chemicals from microbes in the rhizosphere. Infochemicals in nmol concentrations activate receptor-mediated signal pathways, which reprogram the plant responses to environmental changes. The microbial signals have to pass the cell wall to activate pattern recognition receptors at the surface of the plant plasma membrane. The structure of the cell wall is not only a barrier for the signaling molecules, but also changes permanently during growth and development, as well as in response to microbial attacks or abiotic stress. Recently, cellooligomers (COMs) were identified as novel chemical mediators in Arabidopsis thaliana, which inform the cell about the alterations in and around the cell wall. They can be of microbial and plant origin and represent novel invasion patterns (Cook et al., 2015). COMs initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling events that reprogram the cell and adjust the expression and metabolite profiles as well as innate immunity in response to changes in their rhizosphere environment and the state of the cell wall. COMs operate synergistically with other signals or their recognition machineries and activates local and systemic responses in the entire plant. They also adjust the performance of the areal parts of the plant to signals perceived by the roots. Here, I summarize our current knowledge about COMs and propose strategies for future investigations.

COMs: !inform! Cell 
COMs: !activate! Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling events 
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling events: !reprogram! Cell 
Cell: !adjust! Expression and metabolite profiles 
Cell: !adjust! Innate immunity 
COMs: !operate synergistically with! Other signals 
Other signals: !activate! Local and systemic responses 
Local and systemic responses: !adjust! Performance of areal parts of the plant
