The root system architecture in plants is a result of multiple evolutionary innovations over time in response to changing environmental cues. Dichotomy and endogenous lateral branching in the roots evolved in lycophytes lineage but extant seed plants use lateral branching instead. This has led to the development of complex and adaptive root systems, with lateral roots playing a key role in this process exhibiting conserved and divergent features in different plant species. The study of lateral root branching in diverse plant species can shed light on the orderly yet distinct nature of postembryonic organogenesis in plants. This insight provides an overview of the diversity in lateral root (LR) development in various plant species during the evolution of root system in plants.
