<i>Plasmodiophora brassicae</i>, an obligate biotrophic pathogen-causing clubroot disease, can seriously affect <i>Brassica</i> crops worldwide, especially Chinese cabbage. Understanding the transcriptome and metabolome profiling changes during the infection of <i>P. brassicae</i> will provide key insights in understanding the defense mechanism in <i>Brassica</i> crops. In this study, we estimated the phytohormones using targeted metabolome assays and transcriptomic changes using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in the roots of resistant (BrT24) and susceptible (Y510-9) plants at 0, 3, 9, and 20 days after inoculation (DAI) with <i>P. brassicae</i>. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in resistant vs. susceptible lines across different time points were identified. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis of the DEGs revealed six pathways including "Plant-pathogen interaction" and "Plant hormone signal transduction" and 15 hub genes including pathogenic type III effector avirulence factor gene (<i>RIN4</i>) and auxin-responsive protein (<i>IAA16</i>) to be involved in plants immune response. Inhibition of Indoleacetic acid, cytokinin, jasmonate acid, and salicylic acid contents and changes in related gene expression in R-line may play important roles in regulation of clubroot resistance (CR). Based on the combined metabolome profiling and hormone-related transcriptomic responses, we propose a general model of hormone-mediated defense mechanism. This study definitely enhances our current understanding and paves the way for improving CR in <i>Brassica rapa</i>.
