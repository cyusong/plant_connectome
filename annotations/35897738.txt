Aluminum (Al) toxicity causes severe reduction in crop yields in acidic soil. The natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (NRAMPs) play an important role in the transport of mineral elements in plants. Recently, <i>OsNrat1</i> and <i>SbNrat1</i> were reported specifically to transport trivalent Al ions. In this study, we functionally characterized <i>ZmNRAMP4</i>, a gene previously identified from RNA-Seq data from Al-treated maize roots, in response to Al exposure in maize. <i>ZmNRAMP4</i> was predominantly expressed in root tips and was specifically induced by Al stress. Yeast cells expressing <i>ZmNRAMP4</i> were hypersensitive to Al, which was associated with Al accumulation in yeast. Furthermore, overexpression of <i>ZmNRAMP4</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> conferred transgenic plants with a significant increase in Al tolerance. However, expression of <i>ZmNRAMP4</i>, either in yeast or in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, had no effect on the response to cadmium stress. Taken together, these results underlined an internal tolerance mechanism involving <i>ZmNRAMP4</i> to enhance Al tolerance via cytoplasmic sequestration of Al in maize.
