The economically valuable Brassica species include the six related members of U's Triangle. Despite the agronomic and economic importance of these Brassicas, the impacts of evolution and relatively recent domestication events on the genetic landscape of seed development have not been comprehensively examined in these species. Here we present a 3D transcriptome atlas for the six species of U's Triangle, producing a unique resource that captures gene expression data for the major subcompartments of the seed, from the unfertilized ovule to the mature embryo and seed coat. This comprehensive dataset for seed development in tetraploid and ancestral diploid Brassicas provides new insights into evolutionary divergence and expression bias at the gene and subgenome levels during the domestication of these valued crop species. Comparisons of gene expression associated with regulatory networks and metabolic pathways operating in the embryo and seed coat during seed development reveal differences in storage reserve accumulation and fatty acid metabolism among the six Brassica species. This study illustrates the genetic underpinnings of seed traits and the selective pressures placed on seed production, providing an immense resource for continued investigation of Brassica polyploid biology, genomics and evolution.
