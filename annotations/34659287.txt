Critical leaf nutrient concentrations have often been used to diagnose the nutritional status of crops. Determining critical leaf potassium (K) concentrations for the maximum root dry matter (RDM) will provide a reliable means of linking leaf K nutrient concentrations to the yield of sweet potato. Three field experiments, using varying K application rates (0-300 kg K ha<sup>-1</sup>) and two sweet potato cultivars, were performed in the Zhejiang Province of China. A new critical leaf K curve (K<sub>leaf</sub>) based on the maximum RDM was determined to assess K nutrition in sweet potato and described by the equation <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <msub><mrow><mtext>K</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mtext>leaf</mtext></mrow> </msub> <mo>=</mo> <mn>4</mn> <mo>.</mo> <mn>55</mn> <mo>×</mo> <mtext>RD</mtext> <msubsup><mrow><mtext>M</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mo>max</mo></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>0</mn> <mo>.</mo> <mn>075</mn></mrow> </msubsup> </math> . A critical root K curve (K<sub>root</sub>) based on the maximum RDM was also determined to assess K nutrition and described by the equation <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <msub><mrow><mtext>K</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mtext>root</mtext></mrow> </msub> <mo>=</mo> <mn>2</mn> <mo>.</mo> <mn>36</mn> <mo>×</mo> <mtext>RD</mtext> <msubsup><mrow><mtext>M</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mo>max</mo></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>0</mn> <mo>.</mo> <mn>087</mn></mrow> </msubsup> </math> . The K nutrition index (KNI) was constructed to identify the situations of K-limiting and non-K-limiting treatments. The leaf KNI (KNI<sub>leaf</sub>) ranged from 0.56 to 1.17, and the root K KNI (KNI<sub>root</sub>) ranged from 0.52 to 1.35 during the growth period of sweet potato. The results showed that the critical leaf K concentration curve can be used as an accurate leaf K status diagnostic tool at critical growth stages that connected leaf nutrient concentration and sweet potato tuber yield. This K curve will contribute to K management of sweet potato during its growth period in China.
