<i>Platycodon grandiflorus</i> set ornamental, edible, and medicinal plant with broad prospects for further application development. However, there are no reports on the YABBY transcription factor in <i>P. grandiflorus</i>. Identification and analysis of the <i>YABBY</i> gene family of <i>P. grandiflorus</i> using bioinformatics means. Six <i>YABBY</i> genes were identified and divided into five subgroups. Transcriptome data and qRT-PCR were used to analyze the expression patterns of <i>YABBY. YABBY</i> genes exhibited organ-specific patterns in expression in <i>P grandiflorus</i>. Upon salt stress and drought induction, <i>P. grandiflorus</i> presented different morphological and physiological changes with some dynamic changes. Under salt treatment, the <i>YABBY</i> gene family was down-regulated; <i>PgYABBY5</i> was up-regulated in leaves at 24 h. In drought treatment, <i>PgYABBY1, PgYABBY2</i>, and <i>PgYABBY3</i> were down-regulated to varying degrees, but <i>PgYABBY3</i> was significantly up-regulated in the roots. <i>PgYABBY5</i> was up-regulated gradually after being down-regulated. <i>PgYABBY5</i> was significantly up-regulated in stem and leaf at 48 h. <i>PgYABBY6</i> was down-regulated at first and then significantly up-regulated. The dynamic changes of salt stress and drought stress can be regarded as the responses of plants to resist damage. During the whole process of salt and drought stress treatment, the protein content of each tissue part of <i>P grandiflorus</i> changed continuously. At the same time, we found that the promoter region of the <i>PgYABBY</i> gene contains stress-resistant elements, and the regulatory role of YABBY transcription factor in the anti-stress mechanism of <i>P grandiflorus</i> remains to be studied. <i>PgYABBY1, PgYABBY2</i>, and <i>PgYABBY5</i> may be involved in the regulation of saponins in <i>P. grandiflorus. PgYABBY5</i> may be involved in the drought resistance mechanism in <i>P. grandiflorus</i> stems and leaves. This study may provide a theoretical basis for studying the regulation of terpenoids by the YABBY transcription factor and its resistance to abiotic stress.
