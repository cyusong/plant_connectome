['15273290', 'Coimmunoprecipitation of members of the phytochrome red/farred photoreceptor  family from plant extracts has been used to analyze their heteromeric binding  interactions. Phytochrome (phy)B or phyD apoproteins with six myc epitopes fused  to their N termini are biologically active when expressed in Arabidopsis.  Immunoprecipitation of either of these tagged proteins from seedling extracts  coprecipitates additional type II phytochromes: six myc (myc6)-phyB  coprecipitates phyC-phyE; and myc6-phyD coprecipitates phyB and phyE. No  interaction of the epitope-tagged proteins with type I phyA was detected. Gel  filtration chromatography shows that all five of the Arabidopsis phytochromes are  present in seedlings as dimers, and that the heteromeric type II phytochrome  complexes migrate at molecular masses characteristic of heterodimers. Similar  levels of heterodimer formation are observed in extracts of dark-grown seedlings,  where the phytochromes are cytosolic, and light-grown seedlings, where they are  predominantly nuclear. These findings indicate that Arabidopsis, which until now  has been thought to contain five homodimeric forms of phytochrome, in fact  contains multiple species of both homodimeric and heterodimeric phytochromes. The  conservation of the phytochrome family throughout angiosperms suggests that  heterodimeric red/far-red receptors may be present in many flowering plants.', '2004 Aug 3', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0404286101', 'Clack']
