The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) system is a genome editing technology transforming the field of plant biology by virtue of the system's efficiency and specificity. The system has quickly evolved for many diverse applications including multiplex gene mutation, gene replacement and transcriptional control. As CRISPR/Cas9 is increasingly applied to plants, it is becoming clear that each component of the system can be modified to improve editing results. This review aims to highlight common considerations and options when conducting CRISPR/Cas9 experiments.
