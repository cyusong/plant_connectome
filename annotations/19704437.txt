Recent large scale phosphoproteomics studies have helped identify many phosphorylation sites of both membrane and soluble proteins. In most cases the relevance of specific sites has yet to be established whereas in a small number of cases their potency in modulating protein activity is evident. With the increasing amount of data it is becoming clear that phosphosites are often conserved within protein families, pointing to generic regulatory mechanisms. In addition, such mechanisms may be conserved across species. In this addendum evidence is presented for these phenomena occurring in rice and Arabidopsis.
