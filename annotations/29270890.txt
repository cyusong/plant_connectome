KEG is involved in mediating the proteasome-dependent degradation of FDH, a stress-responsive enzyme. The UPS may function to suppress FDH mediated stress responses under favorable growth conditions. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) has been studied in bacteria and yeasts for the purpose of industrial application of NADH co-factor regeneration. In plants, FDH is regarded as a universal stress protein involved in responses to various abiotic and biotic stresses. Here we show that FDH abundance is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). FDH is ubiquitinated in planta and degraded by the 26S proteasome. Interaction assays identified FDH as a potential substrate for the RING-type ubiquitin ligase Keep on Going (KEG). KEG is capable of attaching ubiquitin to FDH in in vitro assays and the turnover of FDH was increased when co-expressed with a functional KEG in planta, suggesting that KEG contributes to FDH degradation. Consistent with a role in regulating FDH abundance, transgenic plants overexpressing KEG were more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of formate. In addition, FDH is a phosphoprotein and dephosphorylation was found to increase the stability of FDH in degradation assays. Based on results from this and previous studies, we propose a model where KEG mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of phosphorylated FDH and, in response to unfavourable growth conditions, reduction in FDH phosphorylation levels may prohibit turnover allowing the stabilized FDH to facilitate stress responses.
