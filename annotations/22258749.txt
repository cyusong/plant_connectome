We previously isolated a soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) gene (sf3'h1) corresponding to the T locus, which controls pubescence and seed coat color, from two near-isogenic lines (NILs), To7B (TT) and To7G (tt). The T allele is also associated with chilling tolerance. Here, Western-blot analysis shows that the sf3'h1 protein was predominantly detected in the hilum and funiculus of the immature seed coat in To7B, whereas sf3'h1 was not detected in To7G. A truncated sf3'h1 protein isolated from To7G was detected only upon enrichment by immunoprecipitation. An analysis using diphenylboric acid 2-aminoethyl ester (DBPA) staining revealed that flavonoids accumulated in the hilum and the funiculus in both To7B and To7G. Further, the scavenging activity of the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical in methanol extracts from the funiculus and hilum of To7B was higher than that of To7G. Moreover, the enzymatic activity of F3'H was detected using microsomal fractions from yeast transformed with sf3'h1 from To7B, but not from To7G. These results indicate that sf3'h1 is involved in flavonoid biosynthesis in the seed coat and affects the antioxidant properties of those tissues. As shown by immunofluorescence microscopy, the sf3'h1 protein was detected primarily around the vacuole in the parenchymatic cells of the hilum in To7B. Further immunoelectron microscopy detected sf3'h1 protein on the membranous structure of the vacuole. Based on these observations, we conclude that F3'H, which is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and has been found to be localized to the ER in other plant systems, is localized in the tonoplast in soybean.
