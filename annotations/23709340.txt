['23709340', 'Cell wall biosynthesis is indispensable for pollen tube growth. Despite its  importance to sexual reproduction, the molecular mechanisms of pollen tube wall  biosynthesis remain poorly understood. Here, we report functional  characterization of two putative Arabidopsis galacturonosyltransferase genes,  GAUT13 and GAUT14, which are essential for pollen tube growth. GAUT13 and GAUT14  encode the proteins that share a high amino acid sequence identity and are  located in the Golgi apparatus. The T-DNA insertion mutants, gaut13 and gaut14,  did not exhibit any observable defects, but the gaut13 gaut14 double mutants were  defective in pollen tube growth; 35.2-37.3% pollen tubes in the heterozygous  double mutants were swollen and defective in elongation. The outer layer of the  cell wall did not appear distinctly fibrillar in the double mutant pollen tubes.  Furthermore, distribution of homogalacturonan labeled with JIM5 and JIM7 in the  double mutant pollen tube wall was significantly altered compared to wild-type.  Our results suggest that GAUT13 and GAUT14 function redundantly in pollen tube  growth, possibly through participation in pectin biosynthesis of the pollen tube  wall.', '2013 Jul', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/sst084', 'Chen']
