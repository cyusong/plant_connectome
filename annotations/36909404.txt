Powdery mildew (PM) is one of the main fungal diseases that appear during the cultivation of the melon fruit crop. Mildew Resistance Locus "O" (MLO) is known as a gene family and has seven conserved transmembrane domains. An induced functional loss of a specific <i>MLO</i> gene could mainly confer PM resistance to melons. However, the genomic structure of <i>MLO</i> genes and its main role in PM resistance still remain unclear in melon. In this study, bioinformatic analysis identified a total of 14 <i>MLO</i> gene family members in the melon genome sequence, and these genes were distributed in an uneven manner on eight chromosomes. The phylogenetic analysis divided the <i>CmMLO</i> genes into five different clades, and gene structural analysis showed that genes in the same clade had similar intron and exon distribution patterns. In addition, by cloning the <i>CmMLO</i> gene sequence in four melon lines, analyzing the <i>CmMLO</i> gene expression pattern after infection, and making microscopic observations of the infection pattern of PM, we concluded that the <i>CmMLO5</i> (<i>MELO3C012438</i>) gene plays a negative role in regulating PM-resistance in the susceptible melon line (Topmark), and the critical time point for gene function was noticed at 24 and 72 hours after PM infection. The mutational analysis exhibited a single base mutation at 572 bp, which further results in loss of protein function, thus conferring PM resistance in melon. In summary, our research evidence provides a thorough understanding of the <i>CmMLO</i> gene family and demonstrates their potential role in disease resistance, as well as a theoretical foundation for melon disease resistance breeding.
