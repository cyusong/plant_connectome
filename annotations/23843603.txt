Maize (Zea mays) develops an extensive shoot-borne root system to secure water and nutrient uptake and to provide anchorage in the soil. In this study, early coleoptilar node (first shoot node) development was subjected to a detailed morphological and histological analysis. Subsequently, microarray profiling via hybridization of oligonucleotide microarrays representing transcripts of 31,355 unique maize genes at three early stages of coleoptilar node development was performed. These pairwise comparisons of wild-type versus mutant rootless concerning crown and seminal roots (rtcs) coleoptilar nodes that do not initiate shoot-borne roots revealed 828 unique transcripts that displayed RTCS-dependent expression. A stage-specific functional analysis revealed overrepresentation of "cell wall," "stress," and "development"-related transcripts among the differentially expressed genes. Differential expression of a subset of 15 of 828 genes identified by these microarray experiments was independently confirmed by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction. In silico promoter analyses revealed that 100 differentially expressed genes contained at least one LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES domain (LBD) motif within 1 kb upstream of the ATG start codon. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments demonstrated RTCS binding for four of these promoter sequences, supporting the notion that differentially accumulated genes containing LBD motifs are likely direct downstream targets of RTCS.
