The number of peroxisomes in a cell can change rapidly in response to changing environmental and physiological conditions. Pexophagy, a type of selective autophagy, is involved in peroxisome degradation, but its physiological role remains to be clarified. Here, we report that cells of the cucumber anthracnose fungus Colletotrichum orbiculare undergo peroxisome degradation as they infect host plants. We performed a random insertional mutagenesis screen to identify genes involved in cucumber pathogenesis by C. orbiculare. In this screen, we isolated a homolog of Pichia pastoris ATG26, which encodes a sterol glucosyltransferase that enhances pexophagy in this methylotrophic yeast. The C. orbiculare atg26 mutant developed appressoria but exhibited a specific defect in the subsequent host invasion step, implying a relationship between pexophagy and fungal phytopathogenicity. Consistent with this, its peroxisomes are degraded inside vacuoles, accompanied by the formation of autophagosomes during infection-related morphogenesis. The autophagic degradation of peroxisomes was significantly delayed in the appressoria of the atg26 mutant. Functional domain analysis of Atg26 suggested that both the phosphoinositide binding domain and the catalytic domain are required for pexophagy and pathogenicity. In contrast with the atg26 mutant, which is able to form appressoria, the atg8 mutant, which is defective in the entire autophagic pathway, cannot form normal appressoria in the earlier steps of morphogenesis. These results indicate a specific function for Atg26-enhanced pexophagy during host invasion by C. orbiculare.
