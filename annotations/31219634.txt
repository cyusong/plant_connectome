['31219634', 'Flowering is a vital developmental shift in plants from vegetative to  reproductive phase. The timing of this shift is regulated by various linked  genetic pathways including environmental cues and internal regulation. Here we  report a role for an Arabidopsis gene, AT1G15480, which encodes a P-class  pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, affecting flowering time. We show that  AT1G15480 is localized to mitochondria. An AT1G15480 T-DNA insertion line  exhibits an early-flowering phenotype, which is quite a rare phenotype among PPR  mutants. The early-flowering phenotype was observed under both long and short  days compared with wild type plants. Genetic complementation confirmed the  observed phenotype. We therefore named the PPR protein PRECOCIOUS1 (POCO1). poco1  plants showed lower respiration, ATP content and higher accumulation of  superoxide. Importantly, the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain  reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C  (FLC), which is a key floral repressor, was strongly downregulated in the poco1.  Likewise, the expression level of the FLC positive regulator ABSCISIC  ACID-INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5) was reduced in the poco1. Consistent with the qRT-PCR  results, poco1 plants showed reduced sensitivity to abscisic acid compared with  wild type with respect to primary root growth and days to flowering. Furthermore,  the poco1 mutation enhances the sensitivity to drought stress. Further analysis  showed that POCO1 affects mitochondrial RNA editing. Taken together, our data  demonstrate a remarkable function of POCO1 in flowering time and the abscisic  acid signalling pathway.', '2019 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.14441', 'ORCID:']
