['10737146', 'Many endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins are known to be localized to the ER by a  mechanism called retrieval, which returns the molecules that are exported from  the ER to the Golgi apparatus back to the ER. Signals are required to be  recognized by this retrieval system. In the work on yeast Saccharomyces  cerevisiae, we have demonstrated that transmembrane domains of a subset of ER  membrane proteins including Sec12p, Sec71p and Sec63p contain novel ER retrieval  signals. For the retrieval of these proteins, a Golgi membrane protein, Rer1p, is  essential (Sato et al., Mol. Biol. Cell 6 (1995) 1459-1477; Proc. Natl. Acad.  Sci. USA 94 (1997) 9693-9698). To address the role of Rer1p in higher eukaryotes,  we searched for homologues of yeast RER1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified  three cDNAs encoding Arabidopsis counterparts of Rer1p with an amino acid  sequence identity of 39-46% to yeast Rer1p and named AtRER1A, AtRER1B, and  AtRER1C1. AtRer1Ap and AtRer1Bp are homologous to each other (85% identity),  whereas AtRer1C1p is less similar to AtRer1Ap and AtRer1Bp (about 50%). Genomic  DNA gel blot analysis indicates that there are several other AtRER1-related  genes, implying that Arabidopsis RER1 constitutes a large gene family. The  expression of these three AtRER1 genes is ubiquitous in various tissues but is  significantly higher in roots, floral buds and a suspension culture in which  secretory activity is probably high. All the three AtRER1 cDNAs complement the  yeast rer1 mutant and remedy the defect of Sec12p mislocalization. However, the  degree of complementation differs among the three with that of AtRER1C1 being the  lowest, again suggesting a divergent role of AtRer1C1p.', '1999 Dec', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1006329828395', 'Nakano']
