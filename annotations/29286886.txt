Rice (Oryza sativa L) is one of the most Mn-tolerant crops that can grow in submerged paddy fields, where the Mn concentration in soil solution is very high due to reduction. Although a large part of Mn is transferred from the roots to the shoot in rice, the roots are constantly exposed to high Mn concentrations in submerged paddies. Thus, mechanisms for preventing Mn overaccumulation in the cytoplasm of root cells are necessary. Recently, we showed that two cation diffusion facilitators, MTP8.1 and MTP8.2, play a crucial role in Mn tolerance in rice roots by sequestering Mn in vacuoles. Moreover, we observed that disruption of MTP8.1 and MTP8.2 resulted in reduced Mn accumulation under excess Mn. In the present study, we examined the effects of disruption of MTP8.1 and MTP8.2 on Mn uptake and determined that this phenotype is caused by a rapid and significant reduction of Mn uptake in response to excess Mn. Previously, we showed that Mn export from root cells through MTP9 was promoted by high Mn. Together, these findings suggest that optimal Mn concentration in rice roots is maintained by reduced uptake, vacuolar sequestration, and extrusion by cation diffusion facilitators.

MTP8.1: !sequesters! Mn 
MTP8.2: !sequesters! Mn 
MTP8.1/MTP8.2 disruption: !reduces! Mn uptake 
MTP9: !promotes! Mn export
