NADPH oxidase activity is involved in plant adaptation and development. The reactive oxygen species sourced by NADPH oxidase activity may contribute to wall strength and protoplast volume adjustment. Root hair bulge apices of the NADPH oxidase mutant rhd2/Atrbohc were more robust than the kjk cellulose synthase mutant, but burst more readily than the wild type (WT). Root epidermal wall appeared impaired in rhd2/Atrbohc, as revealed by the number of protoplasts released by wall-degrading enzymes. Root hair bulges of rhd2/Atrbohc burst more than the WT when challenged in situ with hypo-osmotic low ionic strength medium. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity with diphenylene iodonium caused WT to phenocopy the rhd2/Atrbohc bursting in response to hypo-osmotic shock. This implicates RHD2/AtRBOHC in softening the cell wall to permit protoplast expansion. Overall, the results point to a role for RHD2/AtRBOHC in contributing to wall strength.
