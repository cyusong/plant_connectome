Foliar application of zinc (Zn) to crops is an effective way to increase the grain concentration of Zn. However, the development of more efficient foliar Zn fertilizers is limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the distribution, mobility, and speciation of Zn in leaves once it is taken up by the plant. We performed an experiment using radiolabelled Zn (65Zn), and in situ time-resolved elemental imaging using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM), to investigate the behaviour of two commonly used Zn foliar fertilizers (Zn sulphate and ZnEDTA) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves. Both experiments showed that Zn had limited mobility in leaves, moving <25 mm from the application point after 24 h. Although limited, the translocation of Zn occurred quickly for both treatments; moving more between 3 h and 12 h after application than between 12 h and 24 h. Speciation analysis using synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) showed that ZnEDTA was in fact taken up in chelated form and not as ionic Zn (Zn2+). The XANES data also showed that Zn, from both treatments, was then complexed by ligands in the leaf (e.g. phytate and citrate), potentially in response to localized Zn toxicity. The results of the present study provide important insights into the behaviour of commonly used foliar-applied Zn fertilizers, and can be used to optimize current fertilization strategies and contribute to the development of more efficient foliar Zn fertilizers.
