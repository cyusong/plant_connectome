['26320950', 'Plants use cell-surface-resident receptor-like kinases (RLKs) to sense diverse  extrinsic and intrinsic cues and elicit distinct biological responses. In  Arabidopsis, ERECTA family RLKs recognize EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTORS (EPFs) to  specify stomatal patterning. However, little is known about the molecular link  between ERECTA activation and intracellular signaling. We report here that the  SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK) family RLKs regulate stomatal  patterning downstream of EPF ligands and upstream of a MAP kinase cascade. EPF  ligands induce the heteromerization of ERECTA and SERK family RLKs. SERK and  ERECTA family RLKs transphosphorylate each other. In addition, SERKs associate  with the receptor-like protein (RLP) TMM, a signal modulator of stomata  development, in a ligand-independent manner, suggesting that ERECTA, SERKs, and  TMM form a multiprotein receptorsome consisting of different RLKs and RLP  perceiving peptide ligands to regulate stomatal patterning. In contrast to the  differential requirement of individual SERK members in plant immunity, cell-death  control, and brassinosteroid (BR) signaling, all four functional SERKs are  essential but have unequal genetic contributions to stomatal patterning, with  descending order of importance from SERK3/BAK1 to SERK2 to SERK1 to SERK4.  Although BR signaling connects stomatal development via multiple components, the  function of SERKs in stomatal patterning is uncoupled from their involvement in  BR signaling. Our results reveal that the SERK family is a shared key module in  diverse Arabidopsis signaling receptorsomes and that different combinatorial  codes of individual SERK members regulate distinct functions.', '2015 Sep 21', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2015.07.068', 'Shan']
