['22683260', 'PIN-FORMED (PIN) protein-mediated auxin polar transport is critically important  for development, pattern formation, and morphogenesis in plants. Auxin has been  implicated in the regulation of polar auxin transport by inhibiting PIN  endocytosis, but how auxin regulates this process is poorly understood. Our  genetic screen identified the Arabidopsis SPIKE1 (SPK1) gene whose  loss-of-function mutations increased lateral root density and retarded  gravitropic responses, as do pin2 knockout mutations. SPK1 belongs to the  conserved DHR2-Dock family of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors. The spk1  mutations induced PIN2 internalization that was not suppressed by auxin, as did  the loss-of-function mutations for Rho-like GTPase from Plants 6 (ROP6)-GTPase or  its effector RIC1. Furthermore, SPK1 was required for auxin induction of ROP6  activation. Our results have established a Rho GTPase-based auxin signaling  pathway that maintains PIN2 polar distribution to the plasma membrane via  inhibition of its internalization in Arabidopsis roots. Our findings provide new  insights into signaling mechanisms that underlie the regulation of the dynamic  trafficking of PINs required for long-distance auxin transport and that link  auxin signaling to PIN-mediated pattern formation and morphogenesis.', '2012 Jul 24', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2012.05.019', 'Yang']
