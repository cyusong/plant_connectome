The gas nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in several biological processes in plants, including growth, development, and biotic/abiotic stress responses. Salinity has received increasing attention from scientists as an abiotic stressor that can seriously harm plant growth and crop yields. Under saline conditions, plants produce NO, which can alleviate salt-induced damage. Here, we summarize NO synthesis during salt stress and describe how NO is involved in alleviating salt stress effects through different strategies, including interactions with various other signaling molecules and plant hormones. Finally, future directions for research on the role of NO in plant salt tolerance are discussed. This summary will serve as a reference for researchers studying NO in plants.
