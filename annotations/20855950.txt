Effectors are pathogen-encoded proteins that are thought to facilitate infection by manipulation of host cells. Evidence showing that the effectors of some eukaryotic plant pathogens are able to interact directly with cytoplasmic host proteins indicates that translocation of these proteins into host cells is an important part of infection. Recently, we showed that the flax rust effectors AvrM and AvrL567 are able to internalize into plant cells in the absence of the pathogen. Further, N-terminal sequences that were sufficient for uptake were identified for both these proteins. In light of the possibility that the internalization of fungal and oomycete effectors may require binding to specific phospholipids, the lipid binding activities of AvrM and AvrL567 mutants with different abilities to enter cells were tested. While AvrL567 was not found to bind to phospholipids, AvrM bound strongly to phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl inositol monophosphates and phosphatidyl serine. However, a fragment of AvrM sufficient to direct uptake of a fusion protein into plant cells did not bind to these phospholipids. Thus, our results do not support the role of specific binding of AvrM and AvrL567 to phospholipids for uptake into the plant cytoplasm.

AvrM: !binds to! phosphatidyl inositol
AvrM: !binds to! phosphatidyl inositol monophosphates
AvrM: !binds to! phosphatidyl serine
AvrL567: !does not bind to! phospholipids
AvrM: !directs uptake of! fusion protein
