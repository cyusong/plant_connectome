['10607301', 'The development of the shoot can be divided into a series of distinct  developmental phases based on leaf character-istics and inflorescence  architecture. The relationship between phase length, defined by the number of  organs produced, and the timing of the floral induction (V3-I1 transition) is  relatively ill defined. Characterization of the serrate mutant (CS3257;  Arabidopsis Biological Research Center) revealed defects in both vegetative and  inflores-cence phase lengths, the timing of phase transitions, leaf number, the  leaf initiation rate, and phyllotaxy. The timing of floral induction, however, is  the same as in wild-type in extended short days as well as in short days, whereas  the flowering time response to photoperiod is unaffected. SERRATE is shown to be  required for the development of early juvenile leaves (V1) and to promote late  juvenile leaf development (V2), while suppressing adult leaf (V3) and  inflorescence development (I1 and I2). The se mutation supports the hypothesis  that the timing of floral induction is independent of vegetative and  inflorescence phase lengths. The role of SERRATE in the regulation of phase  length and leaf identity is discussed.', '1999 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1999.00623.x', 'Van']
