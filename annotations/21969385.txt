['21969385', 'The ubiquitin (Ub)-26S proteasome pathway is implicated in various cellular  processes in higher plants. AtAIRP1, a C3H2C3-type RING (for Really Interesting  New Gene) E3 Ub ligase, is a positive regulator in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent drought response. Here, the AtAIRP2 (for  Arabidopsis ABA-insensitive RING protein 2) gene was identified and  characterized. AtAIRP2 encodes a cytosolic C3HC4-type RING E3 Ub ligase whose  expression was markedly induced by ABA and dehydration stress. Thus, AtAIRP2  belongs to a different RING subclass than AtAIRP1 with a limited sequence  identity. AtAIRP2-overexpressing transgenic (35S:AtAIRP2-sGFP) and atairp2  loss-of-function mutant plants exhibited hypersensitive and hyposensitive  phenotypes, respectively, to ABA in terms of seed germination, root growth, and  stomatal movement. 35S:AtAIRP2-sGFP plants were highly tolerant to severe drought  stress, and atairp2 alleles were more susceptible to water stress than were  wild-type plants. Higher levels of drought-induced hydrogen peroxide production  were detected in 35S:AtAIRP2-sGFP as compared with atairp2 plants. ABA-inducible  drought-related genes were up-regulated in 35S:AtAIRP2-sGFP and down-regulated in  atairp2 progeny. The positive effects of AtAIRP2 on ABA-induced stress genes were  dependent on SNF1-related protein kinases, key components of the ABA signaling  pathway. Therefore, AtAIRP2 is involved in positive regulation of ABA-dependent  drought stress responses. To address the functional relationship between AtAIRP1  and AtAIRP2, FLAG-AtAIRP1 and AtAIRP2-sGFP genes were ectopically expressed in  atairp2-2 and atairp1 plants, respectively. Constitutive expression of  FLAG-AtAIRP1 and AtAIRP2-sGFP in atairp2-2 and atairp1 plants, respectively,  reciprocally rescued the loss-of-function ABA-insensitive phenotypes during  germination. Additionally, atairp1/35S:AtAIRP2-sGFP and  atairp2-2/35S:FLAG-AtAIRP1 complementation lines were more tolerant to  dehydration stress relative to atairp1 and atairp2-2 single knockout plants.  Overall, these results suggest that AtAIRP2 plays combinatory roles with AtAIRP1  in Arabidopsis ABA-mediated drought stress responses.', '2011 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.185595', 'Kim']
