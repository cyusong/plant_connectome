Sugar transport across tonoplasts is essential for maintaining cellular sugar homeostasis and metabolic balance in plant cells. It remains unclear, however, how this process is regulated among different classes of sugar transporters. Here, we identified a tonoplast H<sup>+</sup>/glucose symporter, MdERDL6-1, from apples, which was highly expressed in fruits and exhibited expression patterns similar to those of the tonoplast H<sup>+</sup>/sugar antiporters MdTST1 and MdTST2. Overexpression of <i>MdERDL6-1</i> unexpectedly increased not only glucose (Glc) concentration but also that of fructose (Fru) and sucrose (Suc) in transgenic apple and tomato leaves and fruits. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and expression analyses showed an up-regulation of <i>TST1</i> and <i>TST2</i> in the transgenic apple and tomato lines overexpressing <i>MdERDL6-1</i> Further studies established that the increased sugar concentration in the transgenic lines correlated with up-regulation of <i>TST1</i> and <i>TST2</i> expression. Suppression or knockout of <i>SlTST1</i> and <i>SlTST2</i> in the <i>MdERDL6-1-</i>overexpressed tomato background reduced or abolished the positive effect of <i>MdERDL6-1</i> on sugar accumulation, respectively. The findings demonstrate a regulation of <i>TST1</i> and <i>TST2</i> by <i>MdERDL6-1</i>, in which Glc exported by MdERDL6-1 from vacuole up-regulates <i>TST1</i> and <i>TST2</i> to import sugars from cytosol to vacuole for accumulation to high concentrations. The results provide insight into the regulatory mechanism of sugar accumulation in vacuoles mediated by the coordinated action of two classes of tonoplast sugar transporters.
