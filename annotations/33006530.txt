<i>Colletotrichum</i> species cause anthracnose disease on the economically important spice crop chili. A total of 24 <i>Colletotrichum</i> species are known to infect chili and cause anthracnose. <i>C. scovillei</i> belongs to the <i>C. acutatum</i> species complex, and it shows greater aggressiveness than other species, particularly in the case of inoculation onto the nonwounded fruits of chili plants. The current work introduces an initial Illumina-Nanopore hybrid draft genome for <i>C. scovillei</i> TJNH1 together with the related annotations. Knowledge of this genome sequence provides an important reference genome of <i>C. scovillei</i> and will help further understand the pathogenic mechanism of <i>C. scovillei</i> to plant.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
