Nitric oxide (NO) is a signal molecule regarded as being involved in myriad functions in plants under physiological, pathogenic, and adverse environmental conditions. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has also recently been recognized as a new gasotransmitter with a diverse range of functions similar to those of NO. Depending on their respective concentrations, both these molecules act synergistically or antagonistically as signals or damage promoters in plants. Nevertheless, available evidence shows that the complex biological connections between NO and H2S involve multiple pathways and depend on the plant organ and species, as well as on experimental conditions. Cysteine-based redox switches are prone to reversible modification; proteomic and biochemical analyses have demonstrated that certain target proteins undergo post-translational modifications such as S-nitrosation, caused by NO, and persulfidation, caused by H2S, both of which affect functionality. This review provides a comprehensive update on NO and H2S in physiological processes (seed germination, root development, stomatal movement, leaf senescence, and fruit ripening) and under adverse environmental conditions. Existing data suggest that H2S acts upstream or downstream of the NO signaling cascade, depending on processes such as stomatal closure or in response to abiotic stress, respectively.
