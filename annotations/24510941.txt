Copper is an essential micronutrient but it is also potentially toxic as copper ions can catalyse the production of free radicals, which result in various types of cell damage. Therefore, copper homeostasis in plant and animal cells must be tightly controlled. In the chloroplast, copper import is mediated by a chloroplast-envelope PIB-type ATPase, HMA6/PAA1. Copper may also be imported by HMA1, another chloroplast-envelope PIB-ATPase. To get more insights into the specific functional roles of HMA1 and PAA1 in copper homeostasis, this study analysed the phenotypes of plants affected in the expression of both HMA1 and PAA1 ATPases, as well as of plants overexpressing HMA1 in a paa1 mutant background. The results presented here provide new evidence associating HMA1 with copper homeostasis in the chloroplast. These data suggest that HMA1 and PAA1 behave as distinct pathways for copper import and targeting to the chloroplast. Finally, this work also provides evidence for an alternative route for copper import into the chloroplast mediated by an as-yet unidentified transporter that is neither HMA1 nor PAA1.
