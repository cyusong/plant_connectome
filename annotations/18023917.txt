The fragrant rootstocks of Hemidesmus indicus are known to accumulate 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (MBALD), yet, the enzymatic route to this hydroxybenzoate is not known. Therefore, root organs of H. indicus hold promises to unravel the biosynthesis related to this phenolic fragrance. Chitosan treatment at 200mg/L concentration to the excised roots effectively increased phenolic accumulation in both the cortex and cork tissues reaching a peak after 24h treatment and decreasing thereafter. The activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) enzyme in excised roots also increased upon chitosan elicitation, and the maximum specific activity was recorded after 12h of elicitation. Suppression of PAL in vivo by using a specific irreversible inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) resulted in the decrease in MBALD content, indicating its formation via phenylpropanoid pathway.

Chitosan: !increases! Phenolic accumulation
PAL: !synthesizes! MBALD
AOAA: !inhibits! PAL
