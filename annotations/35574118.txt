The section <i>Multicaulia</i> is the largest clade in the genus <i>Hedysarum</i> L. (Fabaceae). Representatives of the sect. <i>Multicaulia</i> are valuable plants used for medicinal and fodder purposes. The taxonomy and phylogeny of the sect. <i>Multicaulia</i> are still ambiguous. To clarify the species relationships within sect. <i>Multicaulia</i>, we, for the first time, explored repeatomes of <i>H. grandiflorum</i> Pall., <i>H. zundukii</i> Peschkova, and <i>H. dahuricum</i> Turcz. using next-generation sequencing technologies and a subsequent bioinformatic analysis by RepeatExplorer/TAREAN pipelines. The comparative repeatome analysis showed that mobile elements made up 20-24% (Class I) and about 2-2.5% (Class II) of their repetitive DNAs. The amount of ribosomal DNA varied from 1 to 2.6%, and the content of satellite DNA ranged from 2.7 to 5.1%. For each species, five high confident putative tandem DNA repeats and 5-10 low confident putative DNA repeats were identified. According to BLAST, these repeats demonstrated high sequence similarity within the studied species. FISH-based mapping of 35S rDNA, 5S rDNA, and satDNAs made it possible to detect new effective molecular chromosome markers for <i>Hedysarum</i> species and construct the species karyograms. Comparison of the patterns of satDNA localization on chromosomes of the studied species allowed us to assess genome diversity within the sect. <i>Multicaulia</i>. In all studied species, we revealed intra- and interspecific variabilities in patterns of the chromosomal distribution of molecular chromosome markers. In <i>H. gmelinii</i> Ledeb. and <i>H. setigerum</i> Turcz. ex Fisch. et Meyer, similar subgenomes were detected, which confirmed the polyploid status of their genomes. Our findings demonstrated a close genomic relationship among six studied species indicating their common origin and confirmed the taxonomic status of <i>H. setigerum</i> as a subspecies of <i>H. gmelinii</i> as well as the validity of combining the sect. <i>Multicaulia</i> and <i>Subacaulia</i> into one sect. <i>Multicaulia</i>.
