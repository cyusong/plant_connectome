Developing embryo and endosperm of sorghum show substantial and multifaceted differences in gene expression and alternative splicing, which are potentially relevant to heterosis. Differential regulation of gene expression and alternative splicing (AS) are major molecular mechanisms dictating plant growth and development, as well as underpinning heterosis in F1 hybrids. Here, using deep RNA-sequencing we analyzed differences in genome-wide gene expression and AS between developing embryo and endosperm, and between F1 hybrids and their pure-line parents in sorghum. We uncover dramatic differences in both gene expression and AS between embryo and endosperm with respect to gene features and functions, which are consistent with the fundamentally different biological roles of the two tissues. Accordingly, F1 hybrids showed substantial and multifaceted differences in gene expression and AS compared with their pure-line parents, again with clear tissue specificities including extents of difference, genes involved and functional enrichments. Our results provide useful transcriptome resources as well as novel insights for further elucidation of seed yield heterosis in sorghum and related crops.
