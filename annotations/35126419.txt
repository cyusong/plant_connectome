Genetic variation in phenological traits is the key in expanding production areas of crops. Southern highbush blueberry (SHB) is a blueberry cultivar group adapted to warmer climates and has been developed by multiple interspecific hybridizations between elite northern highbush blueberry (NHB) (<i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i> L.) and low-chill <i>Vaccinium</i> species native to the southern United States. In this study, we employed a collection of diverse SHB accessions and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for five phenology-related traits [chilling requirement (CR), flowering date, ripening date, fruit development period, and continuous flowering] using polyploid GWAS models. Phenology-related traits showed higher heritability and larger correlation coefficients between year replications, which resulted in the detection of robust phenotype-genotype association peaks. Notably, a single association peak for the CR was detected on Chromosome 4. Comparison of genotypes at the GWAS peaks between NHB and SHB revealed the putative introgression of low-chill and late-flowering alleles into the highbush genetic pool. Our results provide basic insights into the diversity of phenological traits in blueberry and the genetic establishment of current highbush cultivar groups.
