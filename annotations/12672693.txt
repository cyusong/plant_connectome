['12672693', 'Cold temperatures trigger the expression of the CBF family of transcription  factors, which in turn activate many downstream genes that confer chilling and  freezing tolerance to plants. We report here the identification of ICE1 (inducer  of CBF expression 1), an upstream transcription factor that regulates the  transcription of CBF genes in the cold. An Arabidopsis ice1 mutant was isolated  in a screen for mutations that impair cold-induced transcription of a CBF3  promoter-luciferase reporter gene. The ice1 mutation blocks the expression of  CBF3 and decreases the expression of many genes downstream of CBFs, which leads  to a significant reduction in plant chilling and freezing tolerance. ICE1 encodes  a MYC-like bHLH transcriptional activator. ICE1 binds specifically to the MYC  recognition sequences in the CBF3 promoter. ICE1 is expressed constitutively, and  its overexpression in wild-type plants enhances the expression of the CBF regulon  in the cold and improves freezing tolerance of the transgenic plants.', '2003 Apr 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1077503', 'Zhu']
