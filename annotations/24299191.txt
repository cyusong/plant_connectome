Transcription factors constitute numerous signal transduction networks and play a central role in gene expression regulation. Recent studies have shown that a limited portion of transcription factors are anchored in the cellular membrane, storing as dormant forms. Upon exposure to environmental and developmental cues, these transcription factors are released from the membrane and translocated to the nucleus, where they regulate associated target genes. As this process skips both transcriptional and translational regulations, it guarantees prompt response to external and internal signals. Membrane-bound transcription factors (MTFs) undergo several unique steps that are not involved in the action of canonical nuclear transcription factors: proteolytic processing and intracellular movement. Recently, alternative splicing has also emerged as a mechanism to liberate MTFs from the cellular membranes, establishing an additional activation scheme independent of proteolytic processing. Multiple layers of MTF regulation add complexity to transcriptional regulatory scheme and ensure elaborate action of MTFs. In this review, we provide an overview of recent findings on MTFs in plants and highlight the molecular mechanisms underlying MTF liberation from cellular membranes with an emphasis on intracellular movement.
