Just like animals, plants also contain haemoglobins (known as phytoglobins in plants). Plant phytoglobins (Pgbs) have been categorized into 6 different classes, namely, Phytogb0 (Pgb0), Phytogb1 (Pgb1), Phytogb2 (Pgb2), SymPhytogb (sPgb), Leghaemoglobin (Lb), and Phytogb3 (Pgb3). Among the 6 Phytogbs, sPgb and Lb have been functionally characterized, whereas understanding of the roles of other Pgbs is still evolving. In our present study, we have explored the function of 2 rice Pgbs (OsPgb1.1 and OsPgb1.2). OsPgb1.1, OsPgb1.2, OsPgb1.3, and OsPgb1.4 displayed increased level of transcript upon salt, drought, cold, and ABA treatment. The overexpression (OX) lines of OsPgb1.2 in Arabidopsis showed a tolerant phenotype in terms of better root growth in low potassium (K<sup>+</sup> ) conditions. The expression of the known K<sup>+</sup> gene markers such as LOX2, HAK5, and CAX3 was much higher in the OsPgb1.2 OX as compared to wild type. Furthermore, the OsPgb1.2 OX lines showed a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and conversely an increase in the K<sup>+</sup> content, both in root and shoot, as compared to wild type in K<sup>+</sup> limiting condition. Our results indicated the potential involvement of OsPgb1.2 in signalling networks triggered by the nutrient deficiency stresses.
