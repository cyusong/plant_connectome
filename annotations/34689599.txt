Root nodule symbiosis (RNS) is the pillar behind sustainable agriculture and plays a pivotal role in the environmental nitrogen cycle. Most of the genetic, molecular, and cell-biological knowledge on RNS comes from model legumes that exhibit a root-hair mode of bacterial infection, in contrast to the Dalbergoid legumes exhibiting crack-entry of rhizobia. As a step toward understanding this important group of legumes, we have combined microscopic analysis and temporal transcriptome to obtain a dynamic view of plant gene expression during <i>Arachis hypogaea</i> (peanut) nodule development. We generated comprehensive transcriptome data by mapping the reads to <i>A. hypogaea,</i> and two diploid progenitor genomes. Additionally, we performed BLAST searches to identify nodule-induced yet-to-be annotated peanut genes. Comparison between peanut, <i>Medicago truncatula</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Glycine max</i> showed upregulation of 61 peanut orthologs among 111 tested known RNS-related genes, indicating conservation in mechanisms of nodule development among members of the Papilionoid family. Unlike model legumes, recruitment of class 1 phytoglobin-derived symbiotic hemoglobin (SymH) in peanut indicates diversification of oxygen-scavenging mechanisms in the Papilionoid family. Finally, the absence of cysteine-rich motif-1-containing nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptide (<i>NCR</i>) genes but the recruitment of <i>defensin-like NCRs</i> suggest a diverse molecular mechanism of terminal bacteroid differentiation. In summary, our work describes genetic conservation and diversification in legume-rhizobia symbiosis in the Papilionoid family, as well as among members of the Dalbergoid legumes.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
