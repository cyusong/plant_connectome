In 'Tsuda' turnip, the swollen root peel accumulates anthocyanin pigments in a light-dependent manner, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, mutant <i>g120w</i> which accumulated extremely low levels of anthocyanin after light exposure was identified. Segregation analysis showed that the anthocyanin-deficient phenotype was controlled by a single recessive gene. By using bulked-segregant analysis sequencing and CAPS marker-based genetic mapping analyses, a 21.6-kb region on chromosome A07 was mapped, in which a calcium-binding EF hand family protein named BrLETM2 was identified as the causal gene. RNA sequencing analysis showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wild type and <i>g120w</i> in light-exposed swollen root peels were enriched in anthocyanin biosynthetic process and reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosynthetic process GO term. Furthermore, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) staining showed that the ROS level decreased in <i>g120w</i> mutant. Anthocyanins induced by UV-A were abolished by the pre-treatment of seedlings with DPI (an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine nucleoside phosphorylase (NADPH) oxidase) and decreased in <i>g120w</i> mutant. These results indicate that BrLETM2 modulates ROS signaling to promote anthocyanin accumulation in turnip under UV-A and provides new insight into the mechanism of how ROS and light regulate anthocyanin production.
