Petal and stamen identity of the Antirrhinum majus flower is under the genetic control of the floral homeotic gene DEFICIENS (DEF). To isolate factors involved in the regulation of DEF gene activity, a promoter segment of this B-function gene, containing cis-acting regulatory elements, was used to identify the novel trans-acting factor ROSINA (RSI). RSI does not show an extended similarity with any gene product present in the database. Rather RSI constitutes a protein that contains domains similar to known proteins from organisms of different phyla. The capacity of RSI to bind a sequence element of the DEF promoter, its spatial and temporal expression pattern together with the phenotype of RSI-RNAi interference plants as well as RSI over-expression in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that RSI is a putative regulator of DEF gene activity in A. majus.
