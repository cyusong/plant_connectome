Expression profiles of nine rice heat shock protein genes (OsHSPs) were analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The nine genes exhibited distinctive expression in different organs. Expression of nine OsHSP genes was affected differentially by abiotic stresses and abscisic acid (ABA). All nine OsHSP genes were induced strongly by heat shock treatment, whereas none of them were induced by cold. The transcripts of OsHSP80.2, OsHSP71.1 and OsHSP23.7 were increased during salt tress treatment. Expression of OsHSP80.2 and OsHSP24.1 genes were enhanced while treated with 10% PEG. Only OsHSP71.1 was induced by ABA while OsHSP24.1 was suppressed by ABA. These observations imply that the nine OsHSP genes may play different roles in plant development and abiotic stress responses.
