Integrative omics approaches revealed a crosstalk among phytohormones during tuberous root development in cassava. Tuberous root formation is a complex process consisting of phase changes as well as cell division and elongation for radial growth. We performed an integrated analysis to clarify the relationships among metabolites, phytohormones, and gene transcription during tuberous root formation in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). We also confirmed the effects of the auxin (AUX), cytokinin (CK), abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), gibberellin (GA), brassinosteroid (BR), salicylic acid, and indole-3-acetic acid conjugated with aspartic acid on tuberous root development. An integrated analysis of metabolites and gene expression indicated the expression levels of several genes encoding enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis and sucrose metabolism are up-regulated during tuberous root development, which is consistent with the accumulation of starch, sugar phosphates, and nucleotides. An integrated analysis of phytohormones and gene transcripts revealed a relationship among AUX signaling, CK signaling, and BR signaling, with AUX, CK, and BR inducing tuberous root development. In contrast, ABA and JA inhibited tuberous root development. These phenomena might represent the differences between stem tubers (e.g., potato) and root tubers (e.g., cassava). On the basis of these results, a phytohormonal regulatory model for tuberous root development was constructed. This model may be useful for future phytohormonal studies involving cassava.
