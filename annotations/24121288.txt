Calcium, as a ubiquitous second messenger, plays essential roles in tip-growing cells, such as animal neurons, plant pollen tubes, and root hairs. However, little is known concerning the regulatory mechanisms that code and decode Ca(2+) signals in plants. The evidence presented here indicates that a calcium-dependent protein kinase, CPK32, controls polar growth of pollen tubes. Overexpression of CPK32 disrupted the polar growth along with excessive Ca(2+) accumulation in the tip. A search of downstream effector molecules for CPK32 led to identification of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, CNGC18, as an interacting partner for CPK32. Co-expression of CPK32 and CNGC18 resulted in activation of CNGC18 in Xenopus oocytes where expression of CNGC18 alone did not exhibit significant calcium channel activity. Overexpression of CNGC18 produced a growth arrest phenotype coupled with accumulation of calcium in the tip, similar to that induced by CPK32 overexpression. Co-expression of CPK32 and CNGC18 had a synergistic effect leading to more severe depolarization of pollen tube growth. These results provide a potential feed-forward mechanism in which calcium-activated CPK32 activates CNGC18, further promoting calcium entry during the elevation phase of Ca(2+) oscillations in the polar growth of pollen tubes.
