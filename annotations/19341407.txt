['19341407', 'Phosphate (Pi) deficiency causes dramatic root system architecture (RSA) changes  in higher plants. Here we report that overexpression of HRS1 leads to enhanced  sensitivity to low Pi-elicited inhibition of primary root growth in Arabidopsis  thaliana seedlings. Bioinformatic investigations uncovered that HRS1 and its six  homologs encode putative G2-like transcription factors in Arabidopsis. Analysis  of promoter::GUS reporter lines revealed that HRS1 transcripts were present  mainly in the root hair region and root hair cells under Pi-sufficient  conditions. Pi deprivation increased HRS1 expression level and expanded its  expression domain. Although HRS1 knockout mutant did not differ from wild type  (WT) control irrespective of Pi status, its overexpression lines were  significantly more susceptible to low Pi-elicited primary root shortening. In  both WT and HRS1 overexpression seedlings, low Pi-induced primary root shortening  was accompanied by enhanced root hair cell differentiation, but this enhancement  occurred to a greater extent in the latter genotype. Collectively, our data  suggest that HRS1 may be involved in the modulation of primary root and root hair  growth in Pi-deprived Arabidopsis seedlings, and provide useful clues for further  research into the function of HRS1 and its homologs and the mechanisms behind RSA  changes under Pi-deficient conditions.', '2009 Apr', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/j.1744-7909.2009.00819.x', 'Wang']
