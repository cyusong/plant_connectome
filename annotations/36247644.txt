<i>Pectobacterium brasiliense</i> (<i>P. brasiliense</i>) is a necrotrophic bacterium that causes the soft rot disease in <i>Brassica rapa</i>. However, the mechanisms underlying plant immune responses against necrotrophic bacterial pathogens with a broad host range are still not well understood. Using a flg22-triggered seedling growth inhibition (SGI) assay with 455 <i>Brassica rapa</i> inbred lines, we selected six <i>B. rapa</i> flagellin-insensitive lines (<i>Br</i>fin2-7) and three <i>B. rapa</i> flagellin-sensitive lines (<i>Br</i>fs1-3). <i>Br</i>fin lines showed compromised flg22-induced immune responses (oxidative burst, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and seedling growth inhibition) compared to the control line R-o-18; nevertheless, they were resistant to <i>P. brasiliense</i>. To explain this, we analyzed the phytohormone content and found that most <i>Br</i>fin lines had higher <i>P. brasiliense</i>-induced jasmonic acid (JA) than <i>Br</i>fs lines. Moreover, MeJA pretreatment enhanced the resistance of <i>B. rapa</i> to <i>P. brasiliense</i>. To explain the correlation between the resistance of <i>Br</i>fin lines to <i>P. brasiliense</i> and activated JA signaling, we analyzed pathogen-induced glucosinolate (GS) content in <i>B. rapa</i>. Notably, in <i>Br</i>fin7, the neoglucobrassicin (NGBS) content among indole glucosinolates (IGS) was significantly higher than that in <i>Br</i>fs2 following <i>P. brasiliense</i> inoculation, and genes involved in IGSs biosynthesis were also highly expressed. Furthermore, almost all <i>Br</i>fin lines with high JA levels and resistance to <i>P. brasiliense</i> had higher <i>P. brasiliense</i>-induced NGBS levels than <i>Br</i>fs lines. Thus, our results show that activated JA-mediated signaling attenuates flg22-triggered immunity but enhances resistance to <i>P. brasiliense</i> by inducing indole glucosinolate biosynthesis in <i>Brassica rapa</i>. This study provides novel insights into the role of JA-mediated defense against necrotrophic bacterial pathogens within a broad host range.
