Being unable to move, plants are regularly exposed to changing environmental conditions, among which various types of abiotic stress, such as heat, drought, salt, and so forth. These might have deleterious effects on plant performance and yield. Plants thus need to adapt using appropriate stress responses. One of the outcomes of abiotic stress is the need to degrade and recycle damaged proteins and organelles. Autophagy is a conserved eukaryotic mechanism functioning in the degradation of proteins, protein aggregates, and whole organelles. It was previously shown to have a role in plant abiotic stress. This review will describe the current knowledge regarding the involvement of autophagy in plant abiotic stress response, mechanisms functioning in autophagy induction during stress, and possible direction for future research.
