['22802657', 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of gene expression in plants and animals. The  biogenesis of miRNAs is precisely controlled to secure normal development of  organisms. Here we report that TOUGH (TGH) is a component of the  DCL1-HYL1-SERRATE complex that processes primary transcripts of miRNAs [i.e.,  primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs)] into miRNAs in Arabidopsis. Lack of TGH impairs  multiple DCL activities in vitro and reduces the accumulation of miRNAs and  siRNAs in vivo. TGH is an RNA-binding protein, binds pri-miRNAs and precursor  miRNAs in vivo, and contributes to pri-miRNA-HYL1 interaction. These results  indicate that TGH might regulate abundance of miRNAs through promoting DCL1  cleavage efficiency and/or recruitment of pri-miRNAs.', '2012 Jul 31', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1204915109', 'Yu']
