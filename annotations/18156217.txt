['18156217', 'ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters transport diverse substrates across  membranes in various organisms. However, plant ABC transporters have only been  scantily characterized. By taking advantage of the auxin-sensitive Arabidopsis  thaliana root hair cell and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) suspension cell systems,  we show here that Arabidopsis P-glycoprotein4 (PGP4) displays auxin efflux  activity in plant cells. Root hair cell-specific overexpression of PGP4 (PGP4ox)  and known auxin efflux transporters, such as PGP1, PGP19, and PIN-FORMEDs,  decreased root hair elongation, whereas overexpression of the influx transporter  AUXIN-RESISTANT1 enhanced root hair length. PGP4ox-mediated root hair shortening  was rescued by the application of auxin or an auxin efflux inhibitor. These  results indicate that the increased auxin efflux activity conferred by PGP4  reduces auxin levels in the root hair cell and consequently inhibits root hair  elongation. PGP4ox in tobacco suspension cells also increased auxin efflux. PGP4  proteins were targeted to the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis root hair cells and  tobacco cells without any clear subcellular polarity. Brefeldin A partially  interfered with the trafficking of PGP4 reversibly, and this was rescued by  pretreatment with auxin. These results suggest that PGP4 is an auxin efflux  transporter in plants and that its trafficking to the plasma membrane involves  both BFA-sensitive and -insensitive pathways.', '2007 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.054288', 'Cho']
