Among the genes controlling the differentiation and maintenance of epidermal cell fate are members of the HD-ZIP IV class family of plant-specific transcription factors, most of which are specifically expressed in the epidermis of tissues. Here, we report the functional analysis of the maize HD-ZIP IV gene OCL4 (outer cell layer 4) via the phenotypic analysis of two insertional mutants, and of OCL4-RNAi transgenic plants. In all three materials, the macrohairs, one of the three types of trichomes present on adult maize leaf blades, developed ectopically at the margin of juvenile and adult leaves. Consistent with this phenotype, OCL4 is expressed in the epidermis of the leaf blade, with a maximum at the margin of young leaf primordia. Expression of OCL4 in the model plant Arabidopsis under the control of the GLABRA2 (GL2) promoter, a member of the Arabidopsis HD-ZIP IV family involved in trichome differentiation, did not complement the gl2-1 mutant, but instead aggravated its phenotype. The construct also caused a glabrous appearance of rosette leaves in transformed control plants of the Ler ecotype, suggesting that OCL4 inhibits trichome development both in maize and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, insertional mutants showed a partial male sterility that is likely to result from the presence of an extra subepidermal cell layer with endothecium characteristics in the anther wall. Interestingly, the epidermis-specific OCL4 expression in immature anthers was restricted to the region of the anther locule where the extra cell layer differentiated. Taken together these results suggest that OCL4 inhibits trichome development and influences division and/or differentiation of the anther cell wall.
