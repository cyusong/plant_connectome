Overexpressing a heat shock factor gene (TaHsfA6bT) from wheat provides thermotolerance in barley by constitutive expression of heat and other abiotic stress-response genes. Temperature is one of the most crucial abiotic factors defining the yield potential of temperate cereal crops, such as barley. The regulators of heat shock response (HSR), heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs), modulate the transcription level of heat-responsive genes to protect the plants from heat stress. In this study, an Hsf from wheat (TaHsfA6b) is overexpressed in barley for providing thermotolerance. Transgenic barley lines overexpressing TaHsfA6b showed improvement in thermotolerance. The constitutive overexpression of a TaHsfA6b gene upregulated the expression of major heat shock proteins and other abiotic stress-responsive genes. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the upregulation of Hsps, chaperonins, DNAJ, LEA protein genes, and genes related to anti-oxidative enzymes in transgenic lines. Excessive generation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurred in wild-type (WT) plants during heat stress; however, the transgenic lines reflected improved ROS homeostasis mechanisms, showing lesser ROS accumulation under high temperature. No negative phenotypic changes were observed in overexpression lines. These results suggest that TaHsfA6b is a regulator of HSR and its overexpression altered the expression patterns of some main stress-related genes and enhanced the thermotolerance of this cereal crop.
