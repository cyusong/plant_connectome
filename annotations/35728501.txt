The aims of this study were: i) to investigate mature plant resistance (MPR) against four strains of Potato virus Y (PVY<sup>O</sup>, PVY<sup>N</sup>, PVY<sup>NTN</sup> and PVY<sup>N-Wi</sup>) in potato cultivars that differ in maturity (e.g. early or maincrop) at different developmental stages, and ii) to determine whether phloem translocation of photoassimilates at different stages including the source-sink transition influences MPR. The data showed that MPR was functional by the flowering stage in all cultivars, and that the host-pathogen interaction is highly complex, with all three variables (potato cultivar, virus strain and developmental stage of infection) having a significant effect on the outcome. However, virus strain was the most important factor, and MPR was less effective in protecting tubers from recombinant virus strains (PVY<sup>NTN</sup> and PVY<sup>N-Wi</sup>). Development of MPR was unrelated to foliar phloem connectivity, which was observed at all developmental stages, but a switch from symplastic to apoplastic phloem unloading early in tuber development may be involved in the prevention of tuber infections with PVY<sup>O</sup>. Recombinant virus strains were more infectious than parental strains and PVY<sup>NTN</sup> has a more effective silencing suppressor than PVY<sup>O</sup>, another factor that may contribute to the efficiency of MPR. The resistance conferred by MPR against PVY<sup>O</sup> or PVY<sup>N</sup> may be associated with or enhanced by the presence of the corresponding strain-specific HR resistance gene in the cultivar.
