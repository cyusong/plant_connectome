Signaling peptides play crucial roles in plant growth, development and defense. We report here that the Arabidopsis thaliana secreted peptide, ROOT MERISTEM GROWTH FACTOR 7 (RGF7), functions as an endogenous elicitor to trigger plant immunity. Expression of the RGF7 precursor-encoding gene (preRGF7) is highly induced in Arabidopsis leaves upon infection by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. The pathogen-responsive preRGF7 expression is regulated by the transcription factor WRKY33 and its upstream mitogen-activated protein kinases MPK3/MPK6 and calcium-dependent protein kinases CPK5/CPK6. In the absence of pathogen attack, chemically induced expression of preRGF7 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants was sufficient to trigger immune responses. Pre-induction of preRGF7 expression in transgenic Arabidopsis also led to enhanced immune responses and increased resistance to P. syringae infection. Biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrated that RGF7 is perceived by the leaf-expressed RGF1 INSENSITIVE (RGI) family receptors RGI4 and RGI5. The SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASES (SERKs) BAK1 and SERK4 are also involved in RGF7 perception via forming RGF7-induced receptor-complexes with RGI4 and RGI5. These results indicate that the pathogen-induced RGF7 peptide, perceived by the RGI4/RGI5-BAK1/SERK4 receptor complexes, acts as a new damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and plays a significant role in Arabidopsis immunity.
