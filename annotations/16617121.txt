Many cell biologists wish to know the subcellular localization of proteins of interest. Proteomics methods have the potential to describe the entire protein content of organelles. However, practical limitations in organelle isolation and analysis of low abundance proteins have meant that organelle proteomics has had, until recently, only limited success. Some examples of quantitative proteomic methods and their use in the study of plant organelle proteomes are discussed here. It is concluded that 2D-difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) as well as differential isotope tagging strategies coupled to non-gel-based LC-MS are proving useful in this area of research.
