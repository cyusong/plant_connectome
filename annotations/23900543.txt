Trichome and root hair patterning is governed by a gene regulatory network involving TTG1 and several homologous MYB and bHLH proteins. The bHLH proteins GL3 and EGL3 are core components that serve as a regulatory platform for the activation of downstream genes. In this study we show that a homologue of GL3 and EGL3, AtMYC1, can regulate the intracellular localisation of GL1 and TRY. AtMYC1 protein is predominantly localised in the cytoplasm and can relocate GL1 from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Conversely, AtMYC1 can be recruited into the nucleus by TRY and CPC, concomitant with a strong accumulation of TRY and CPC in the nucleus. When AtMYC1 is targeted to the nucleus or cytoplasm by nuclear localisation or export signals (NLS or NES), respectively, the intracellular localisation of GL1 and TRY also changes accordingly. The biological significance of this intracellular localisation is suggested by the finding that the efficiency of rescue of trichome number is significantly altered in NES and NLS fusions as compared with wild-type AtMYC1. Genetic analysis of mutants and overexpression lines supports the hypothesis that AtMYC1 represses the activity of TRY and CPC.
