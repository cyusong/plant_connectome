Dynamic process-based plant models capture complex physiological response across time, carrying the potential to extend simulations out to novel environments and lend mechanistic insight to observed phenotypes. Despite the translational opportunities for varietal crop improvement that could be unlocked by linking natural genetic variation to first principles-based modeling, these models are challenging to apply to large populations of related individuals. Here we use a combination of model development, experimental evaluation, and genomic prediction in Brassica rapa L. to set the stage for future large-scale process-based modeling of intraspecific variation. We develop a new canopy growth submodel for B. rapa within the process-based model Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator (TREES), test input parameters for feasibility of direct estimation with observed phenotypes across cultivated morphotypes and indirect estimation using genomic prediction on a recombinant inbred line population, and explore model performance on an in silico population under non-stressed and mild water-stressed conditions. We find evidence that the updated whole-plant model has the capacity to distill genotype by environment interaction (G×E) into tractable components. The framework presented offers a means to link genetic variation with environment-modulated plant response and serves as a stepping stone towards large-scale prediction of unphenotyped, genetically related individuals under untested environmental scenarios.
