Phytohormones are supposed to contribute to the establishment of mutualistic Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbioses. However, their role in the acclimation of micropropagated plantlet inoculated with AM is still unknown. To address this question, we performed a hormone profiling during the acclimation of Satureja khuzistanica plantlets inoculated with Rhizoglomus fasciculatum. The levels of indoleacetic acid (IAA), methyl indole acetic acid, cis-zeatin, cis zeatin ribose, jasmonate, jasmonoyl isoleucine, salicylic acid, abscisic acid (ABA) were analyzed. Further, the relative gene expression of AOS (Allene oxide synthase) as a key enzyme of jasmonate biosynthesis, in either inoculated or non-inoculated micropropagated plantlets was evaluated during acclimation period. The concentrations of IAA and cis-zeatin increased in the plantlets inoculated by AM whereas the concentration of ABA decreased upon 60 days acclimation in the whole shoot of plantlets of S. khuzistanica. The relative expression of AOS gene resulted in an increase of isoleucine jasmonate, the bioactive form of jasmonate. Based on our results, IAA and cis-zeatin probably contribute to maintaining growth, and AM reduces transition stress by modifying ABA and jasmonate concentrations.

IAA: !increases in! inoculated plantlets
cis-zeatin: !increases in! inoculated plantlets
ABA: !decreases in! inoculated plantlets
AOS gene: !increases expression of! isoleucine jasmonate
