Plant-parasitic nematodes secrete an array of cell-wall-degrading enzymes to overcome the physical barrier formed by the plant cell wall. Here, we describe a novel pectate lyase gene <i>Mg-PEL1</i> from <i>M. graminicola</i>. Quantitative real-time PCR assay showed that the highest transcriptional expression level of <i>Mg-PEL1</i> occurred in pre-parasitic second-stage juveniles, and it was still detected during the early parasitic stage. Using <i>in situ</i> hybridization, we showed that Mg-PEL1 was expressed exclusively within the subventral esophageal gland cells of <i>M. graminicola.</i> The yeast signal sequence trap system revealed that it possessed an N-terminal signal peptide with secretion function. Recombinant Mg-PEL1 exhibited hydrolytic activity toward polygalacturonic acid. Rice plants expressing RNA interference vectors targeting <i>Mg-PEL1</i> showed an increased resistance to <i>M. graminicola</i>. In addition, using an <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transient expression system and plant immune response assays, we demonstrated that the cell wall localization of Mg-PEL1 was required for the activation of plant defense responses, including programmed plant cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and expression of defense-related genes. Taken together, our results indicated that Mg-PEL1 could enhance the pathogenicity of <i>M. graminicola</i> and induce plant immune responses during nematode invasion into plants or migration in plants. This provides a new insight into the function of pectate lyases in plants-nematodes interaction.
