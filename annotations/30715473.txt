Microspore embryogenesis is an experimental morphogenic pathway with important applications in basic research and applied plant breeding, but its genetic, cellular, and molecular bases are poorly understood. We applied a multidisciplinary approach using confocal and electron microscopy, detection of Ca2+, callose, and cellulose, treatments with caffeine, digitonin, and endosidin7, morphometry, qPCR, osmometry, and viability assays in order to study the dynamics of cell wall formation during embryogenesis induction in a high-response rapeseed (Brassica napus) line and two recalcitrant rapeseed and eggplant (Solanum melongena) lines. Formation of a callose-rich subintinal layer (SL) was common to microspore embryogenesis in the different genotypes. However, this process was directly related to embryogenic response, being greater in high-response genotypes. A link could be established between Ca2+ influx, abnormal callose/cellulose deposition, and the genotype-specific embryogenic competence. Callose deposition in inner walls and SLs are independent processes, regulated by different callose synthases. Viability and control of internal osmolality are also related to SL formation. In summary, we identified one of the causes of recalcitrance to embryogenesis induction: a reduced or absent protective SL. In responding genotypes, SLs are markers for changes in cell fate and serve as osmoprotective barriers to increase viability in imbalanced in vitro environments. Genotype-specific differences relate to different responses against abiotic (heat/osmotic) stresses.
