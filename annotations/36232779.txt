Crop growth and development are frequently affected by biotic and abiotic stresses. The adaptation of crops to stress is mostly achieved by regulating specific genes. The root system is the primary organ for nutrient and water uptake, and has an important role in drought stress response. The improvement of stress tolerance to increase crop yield potential and yield stability is a traditional goal of breeders in cultivar development using integrated breeding methods. An improved understanding of genes that control root development will enable the formulation of strategies to incorporate stress-tolerant genes into breeding for complex agronomic traits and provide opportunities for developing stress-tolerant germplasm. We screened the genes associated with root growth and development from diverse plants including <i>Arabidopsis</i>, rice, maize, pepper and tomato. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the application of root-related genes in molecular breeding to achieve crop drought tolerance by the improvement of root architecture.
