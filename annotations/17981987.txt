['17981987', 'The vacuole occupies most of the volume of plant cells; thus, the tonoplast  marker delta-tonoplast intrinsic protein-green fluorescent protein delineates  cell shape, for example, in epidermis. This permits rapid identification of  mutants. Using this strategy, we identified the cell shape phenotype-1 (csp-1)  mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana. Beyond an absence of lobes in pavement cells,  phenotypes included reduced trichome branching, altered leaf serration and stem  branching, and increased stomatal density. This result from a point mutation in  AtTPS6 encoding a conserved amino-terminal domain, thought to catalyze  trehalose-6-phosphate synthesis and a carboxy-terminal phosphatase domain, is  catalyzing a two-step conversion to trehalose. Expression of AtTPS6 in the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants tps1 (encoding a synthase domain) and tps2  (encoding synthase and phosphatase domains) indicates that AtTPS6 is an active  trehalose synthase. AtTPS6 fully complemented defects in csp-1. Mutations in  class I genes (AtTPS1-AtTPS4) indicate a role in regulating starch storage,  resistance to drought, and inflorescence architecture. Class II genes  (AtTPS5-AtTPS11) encode multifunctional enzymes having synthase and phosphatase  activity. We show that class II AtTPS6 regulates plant architecture, shape of  epidermal pavement cells, and branching of trichomes. Thus, beyond a role in  development, we demonstrate that the class II gene AtTPS6 is important for  controlling cellular morphogenesis.', '2008 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.107.107441', 'Raikhel']
