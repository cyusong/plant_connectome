Trichome formation has been extensively studied as a mechanistic model for epidermal cell differentiation and cell morphogenesis in plants. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying trichome formation (i.e., initiation and elongation) in rice remain largely unclear. Here, we report an AP2/ERF transcription factor, Hairy Leaf 6 (HL6), which controls trichome formation in rice. Functional analyses revealed that HL6 transcriptionally regulates trichome elongation in rice, which is dependent on functional OsWOX3B, a homeodomain-containing protein that acts as a key regulator in trichome initiation. Biochemical and molecular genetic analyses demonstrated that HL6 physically interacts with OsWOX3B, and both of them regulate the expression of some auxin-related genes during trichome formation, in which OsWOX3B likely enhances the binding ability of HL6 with one of its direct target gene, OsYUCCA5. Population genetic analysis indicated that HL6 was under negative selection during rice domestication. Taken together, our findings provide new insights into the molecular regulatory network of trichome formation in rice.
