Terminal heat stress during reproductive stage in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) causes pollen grain sterility and has a drastic impact on wheat crop production. Finding genotypes with high pollen viability under heat stress is crucial to cope with the impact of climate change through developing heat-tolerant cultivars. To assess the effect of terminal heat stress on pollen viability in a panel of spring wheat genotypes (<i>N</i> = 200), RCBD (randomized complete block design) field trials were conducted under normal and heat stress conditions for two consecutive years (2020-2021 and 2021-2022). Analysis of variance showed significant variation in genotypes, treatments, and genotype × treatment interaction. Fifty and 46 genotypes were categorized as heat tolerant (<i>HSI</i> <sub><i>pv</i></sub> < 0.5) in the first and second year, respectively. Twelve genotypes, namely, Chenab-70, Pari-73, Pak-81, MH-21, Punjab-76, NIFA-Aman, NUWYT-63, Swabi-1, Nisnan-21, Frontana, Amin-2000, and Pirsabak-2004, were found to be heat tolerant across the years. The violin plot displayed a trend of improvement in heat tolerance (<i>HSI</i> <sub><i>pv</i></sub> < 0.5) over the period of time in many modern wheat varieties. However, some modern wheat varieties released after 2001 such as Janbaz-09 (57%), Ghazi-2019 (57%), and Sindhu-16 (43%) had very low pollen viability under heat stress conditions. The results of phenotypic coefficient of variance (PCV%), genotypic coefficient of variance (GCV%), broad sense heritability (h<sup>2</sup> <sub>bs</sub>), and genetic advance (GA) suggested the major contribution of genetic factors in controlling pollen viability trait. Higher values of h<sup>2</sup> <sub>bs</sub> and GA under heat stress conditions suggested pollen viability as a heat tolerance trait controlled by additive genetic effects. Taken together, these results suggested pollen viability as a useful trait for selection in early generations under elevated temperatures. The genotypes identified as heat tolerant in both years can be used as genetic resources for breeding cultivars with higher pollen viability under elevated temperature conditions.
