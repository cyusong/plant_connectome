['7638178', 'The syntaxin family of integral membrane proteins are thought to function as  receptors for transport vesicles, with different isoforms of this family  localized to various membranes throughout the cell. The yeast Pep12 protein is a  syntaxin homologue which may function in the trafficking of vesicles from the  trans-Golgi network to the vacuole. We have isolated an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA  by functional complementation of a yeast pep12 mutant. The Arabidopsis cDNA  (aPEP12) potentially encodes a 31-kDa protein which is homologous to yeast Pep12  and to other members of the syntaxin family, indicating that this protein may  function in the docking or fusion of transport vesicles with the vacuolar  membrane in plant cells. Northern blot analysis indicates that the mRNA is  expressed in all tissues examined, although at a very low level in leaves. The  mRNA is found in all cell types in roots and leaves, as shown by in situ  hybridization experiments. The existence of plant homologues of proteins of the  syntaxin family indicates that the basic vesicle docking and fusion machinery may  be conserved in plants as it is in yeast and mammals.', '1995 Aug 1', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.92.16.7262', 'Raikhel']
