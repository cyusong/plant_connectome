['22898498', 'Jasmonates (JAs) regulate various stress responses and development processes in  plants, and the JA pathway is tightly controlled. In this study, we report the  functional characterization of two novel RING-type ubiquitin ligases, RING DOMAIN  LIGASE3 (RGLG3) and RGLG4, in modulating JA signaling. Both RGLG3 and RGLG4  possessed ubiquitin ligase activities and were widely distributed in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) tissues. Altered expression of RGLG3 and RGLG4 affected  methyl JA-inhibited root growth and JA-inductive gene expression, which could be  suppressed by the coronatine insensitive1 (coi1) mutant. rglg3 rglg4 also  attenuated the inhibitory effect of JA-isoleucine-mimicking coronatine on root  elongation, and consistently, rglg3 rglg4 was resistant to the  coronatine-secreting pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000, suggesting  that RGLG3 and RGLG4 acted in response to the coronatine and promoted JA-mediated  pathogen susceptibility. In addition, rglg3 rglg4 repressed wound-stunted plant  growth, wound-stimulated expression of JA-responsive genes, and wound-induced JA  biosynthesis, indicating their roles in JA-dependent wound response. Furthermore,  both RGLG3 and RGLG4 responded to methyl JA, P. syringae pv tomato DC3000, and  wounding in a COI1-dependent manner. Taken together, these results indicate that  the ubiquitin ligases RGLG3 and RGLG4 are essential upstream modulators of JA  signaling in response to various stimuli.', '2012 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.203422', 'An']
