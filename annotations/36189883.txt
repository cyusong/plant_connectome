The European Search Catalogue for Plant Genetic Resources (EURISCO) is a central entry point for information on crop plant germplasm accessions from institutions in Europe and beyond. In total, it provides data on more than two million accessions, making an important contribution to unlocking the vast genetic diversity that lies deposited in >400 germplasm collections in 43 countries. EURISCO serves as the reference system for the Plant Genetic Resources Strategy for Europe and represents a significant approach for documenting and making available the world's agrobiological diversity. EURISCO is well established as a resource in this field and forms the basis for a wide range of research projects. In this paper, we present current developments of EURISCO, which is accessible at http://eurisco.ecpgr.org.
