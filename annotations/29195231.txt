Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates leaf growth and transpiration rate of plants exposed to salt stress. Despite the known fact that cell dehydration is instrumental for the modulation of ABA concentrations when NaCl is high in the external environment, it was never tested as to whether sodium (Na) or chlorine (Cl) also modulate ABA concentrations. To answer this question, a hydroponic study on maize (Zea mays) was established, by exposing plants to 50mM of sodium glucosamide or glucosamine chloride. The effect of both ions on ABA was investigated in an early stage before (i) the salt ions accumulated to toxic tissue concentrations and before (ii) cells dehydrated. This allowed studying early responses to Na and Cl separately, well before plants were stressed by these ions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to quantify ABA concentrations in roots and in leaves after a period of 2h after ion application. The transcript abundance of the key regulatory enzyme of the biosynthesis of ABA in maize, the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene viviparous 14, was quantified via real-time quantitative-reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction. The results reveal that Cl and Na induce the increase of leaf tissue ABA concentrations at two hours after plants were exposed to 50mM of the ions. Surprisingly, this effect was more pronounced in response to the Cl component. The increase in the guard-cell regulating ABA concentration correlated with a reduced transpiration. Mainly because of this result we suggest that the early accumulation of ABA is useful in maintaining cell turgor.
