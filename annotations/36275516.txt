Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules with functions independent of any protein-coding potential. A whole transcriptome (RNA-seq) study of Arabidopsis shoots under iron sufficient and deficient conditions was carried out to determine the genes that are iron-regulated in the shoots. We identified two previously unannotated transcripts on chromosome 1 that are significantly iron-regulated. We have called this iron-regulated lncRNA, <i>CAN OF SPINACH</i> (<i>COS</i>). <i>cos</i> mutants have altered iron levels in leaves and seeds. Despite the low iron levels in the leaves, <i>cos</i> mutants have higher chlorophyll levels than WT plants. Moreover, <i>cos</i> mutants have abnormal development during iron deficiency. Roots of <i>cos</i> mutants are longer than those of WT plants, when grown on iron deficient medium. In addition, <i>cos</i> mutant plants accumulate singlet oxygen during iron deficiency. The mechanism through which <i>COS</i> affects iron deficiency responses is unclear, but small regions of sequence similarity to several genes involved in iron deficiency responses occur in <i>COS</i>, and small RNAs from these regions have been detected. We hypothesize that <i>COS</i> is required for normal adaptation to iron deficiency conditions.
