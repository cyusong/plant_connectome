We previously isolated a single domain antibody (V<sub>H</sub>H) that binds Enterohemorrhagic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (EHEC) with the end-goal being the enteromucosal passive immunization of cattle herds. To improve the yield of a chimeric fusion of the V<sub>H</sub>H with an IgA Fc, we employed two rational design strategies, supercharging and introducing <i>de novo</i> disulfide bonds, on the bovine IgA Fc component of the chimera. After mutagenizing the Fc, we screened for accumulation levels after transient transformation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves. We identified and characterized five supercharging and one disulfide mutant, termed '(5 + 1)Fc', that improve accumulation in comparison to the native Fc. Combining all these mutations is associated with a 32-fold increase of accumulation for the Fc alone, from 23.9 mg/kg fresh weight (FW) to 599.5 mg/kg FW, as well as a twenty-fold increase when fused to a V<sub>H</sub>H that binds EHEC, from 12.5 mg/kg FW tissue to 236.2 mg/kg FW. Co-expression of native or mutated V<sub>H</sub>H-Fc with bovine joining chain (JC) and bovine secretory component (SC) followed by co-immunoprecipitation suggests that the stabilizing mutations do not interfere with the capacity of V<sub>H</sub>H-Fc to assemble with JC and FC into a secretory IgA. Both the native and the mutated V<sub>H</sub>H-Fc similarly neutralized the ability of four of the seven most prevalent EHEC strains (O157:H7, O26:H11, O111:Hnm, O145:Hnm, O45:H2, O121:H19 and O103:H2), to adhere to HEp-2 cells as visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy and quantified by fluorometry. These results collectively suggest that supercharging and disulfide bond tethering on a Fc chain can effectively improve accumulation of a V<sub>H</sub>H-Fc fusion without impacting V<sub>H</sub>H functionality.
