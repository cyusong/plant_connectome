['19141707', 'Starch is the major storage carbohydrate in plants. It is comprised of glucans  that form semicrystalline granules. Glucan phosphorylation is a prerequisite for  normal starch breakdown, but phosphoglucan metabolism is not understood. A  putative protein phosphatase encoded at the Starch Excess 4 (SEX4) locus of  Arabidopsis thaliana was recently shown to be required for normal starch  breakdown. Here, we show that SEX4 is a phosphoglucan phosphatase in vivo and  define its role within the starch degradation pathway. SEX4 dephosphorylates both  the starch granule surface and soluble phosphoglucans in vitro, and sex4 null  mutants accumulate phosphorylated intermediates of starch breakdown. These  compounds are linear alpha-1,4-glucans esterified with one or two phosphate  groups. They are released from starch granules by the glucan hydrolases  alpha-amylase and isoamylase. In vitro experiments show that the rate of starch  granule degradation is increased upon simultaneous phosphorylation and  dephosphorylation of starch. We propose that glucan phosphorylating enzymes and  phosphoglucan phosphatases work in synergy with glucan hydrolases to mediate  efficient starch catabolism.', '2009 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.064360', 'Zeeman']
