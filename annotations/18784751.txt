['18784751', "The LEAFY (LFY) protein is a key regulator of flower development in angiosperms.  Its gradually increased expression governs the sharp floral transition, and LFY  subsequently controls the patterning of flower meristems by inducing the  expression of floral homeotic genes. Despite a wealth of genetic data, how LFY  functions at the molecular level is poorly understood. Here, we report crystal  structures for the DNA-binding domain of Arabidopsis thaliana LFY bound to two  target promoter elements. LFY adopts a novel seven-helix fold that binds DNA as a  cooperative dimer, forming base-specific contacts in both the major and minor  grooves. Cooperativity is mediated by two basic residues and plausibly accounts  for LFY's effectiveness in triggering sharp developmental transitions. Our  structure reveals an unexpected similarity between LFY and helix-turn-helix  proteins, including homeodomain proteins known to regulate morphogenesis in  higher eukaryotes. The appearance of flowering plants has been linked to the  molecular evolution of LFY. Our study provides a unique framework to elucidate  the molecular mechanisms underlying floral development and the evolutionary  history of flowering plants.", '2008 Oct 8', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2008.184', 'Muller']
