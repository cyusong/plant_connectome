The 2-Cys peroxiredoxin-A (2CPA) promoter is a model promoter to study redox and ABA-dependent stress signaling. Here, an Arabidopsis reporter gene line expressing luciferase under control of the 2CPA promoter was used to study the impact of ascorbate on reporter gene transcription in a series of protoplast and leaf slice incubation experiments. It was shown that ascorbate has a dual function on gene expression regulation. First, a comparison of responses to ascorbate, dehydroascorbate and reduced and oxidized glutathione demonstrated that ascorbate feeding supports gene expression regulation by increasing the catalytic capacity in redox signaling, as defined by the concentration of low molecular weight antioxidants and their oxidized counterparts. Second, ascorbate had a specific and light-dependent effect on 2CPA transcription, which cannot be substituted by reduced glutathione. Based on the differences between ascorbate and glutathione in the subcellular redox-cycling capacities, it is concluded that ascorbate feeding modulates chloroplast-specific regulation of 2CPA expression.
