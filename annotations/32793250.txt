The endophytic microbiome plays an important role in plant health and pathogenesis. However, little is known about its relationship with bacterial blight (BB) of rice caused by <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>). The current study compared the community compositional structure of the endophytic microbiota in healthy and BB symptomatic leaves of rice through a metabarcoding approach, which revealed BB induced a decrease in the alpha-diversity of the fungal communities and an increase in the bacterial communities. BB-diseased rice leaves were enriched with saprophytic fungi that are capable of decomposing plant cell walls (<i>e.g. Khuskia</i> spp. and <i>Leptosphaerulina</i> spp.), while healthy rice leaves were found to be significantly more abundant with plant pathogens or mycotoxin-producing fungi (<i>e.g. Fusarium</i>, <i>Magnaporthe</i>, and <i>Aspergillus</i>). The endophytic bacterial communities of BB-diseased leaves were significantly enriched with <i>Pantoea</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, and <i>Curtobacterium</i>, strains. <i>Pantoea</i> sp. isolates from BB leaves are identified as promising candidates for the biocontrol of BB for their ability to inhibit <i>in vitro</i> growth of <i>Xoo</i>, suppress the development of rice BB disease, and possess multiple PGP characteristics. Our study revealed BB-induced complexed changes in the endophytic fungal and bacterial communities of rice leaves and demonstrated that BB-associated enrichment of some endophytic bacterial taxa, <i>e.g. Pantoea</i> sp. isolates, may play important roles in suppressing the development of BB disease in rice.
