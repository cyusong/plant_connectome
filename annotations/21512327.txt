MYC2 and SPA1 are two key regulatory proteins that negatively regulate light-controlled Arabidopsis seedling development. We have recently demonstrated the genetic and molecular relationships of MYC2 and SPA1 in light and JA (jasmonic acid) signaling pathways. Here, we have further shown the genetic interactions between these two proteins in flowering time and lateral root development.

MYC2: !negatively regulates! seedling development
MYC2: !interacts with! SPA1
SPA1: !interacts with! MYC2
MYC2 and SPA1: !regulate! light and JA signaling pathways
MYC2 and SPA1: !genetically interact! in flowering time and lateral root development
