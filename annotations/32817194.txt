Elucidating proteolipidome dynamics is crucial for understanding the roles of these molecules in plant physiology and disease. Sequence-based functional annotation of the protein is inadequate, since protein activities depend on posttranslational modification. In this study, we applied a gel-free activity-based protein profiling approach to unravel the active lipases, including other Serine hydrolases (SHs), expressed during seed germination in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We successfully mapped the active sites of 43 active SHs encompassing lipases/esterases, GDSL lipases, proteases, Ser carboxypeptidases, ABHD protein, pectin acetylesterase, and other SHs. The mRNA expression levels of those genes encoding the identified SHs were monitored using microarray analysis. The lipidome analysis revealed distinct patterns of molecular species distribution in individual lipid classes and displayed the metabolic connections between lipid mobilization and rice seedling growth. Changes in the mobilization of storage lipids and their molecular species remodeling were correlated with the expression of the identified lipases and their lipase activity in a time-dependent manner. The physiological significance of the identified SHs was explored during biotic stress with <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i> infection. The fungal infection significantly reduced lipase activity and lipid mobilization, thus impairing the rice seedling. Collectively, our data demonstrate application of the functional proteome strategy along with the shotgun lipidome approach for the identification of active SHs, and thus for deciphering the role of lipid homeostasis during rice seed germination.
