Bottlenecks in plant transformation and regeneration have slowed progress in applying CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing for crop improvement. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) has highly efficient <i>temperate japonica</i> transformation protocols, along with reasonably efficient <i>indica</i> protocols using immature embryos. However, rapid and efficient protocols are not available for transformation and regeneration in <i>tropical japonica</i> varieties, even though they represent the majority of rice production in the U.S. and South America. The current study has optimized a protocol using callus induction from mature seeds with both <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated and biolistic transformation of the high-yielding U.S. <i>tropical japonica</i> cultivar Presidio. Gene editing efficiency was tested by evaluating knockout mutations in the <i>phytoene desaturase</i> (<i>PDS</i>) and <i>young seedling albino</i> (<i>YSA</i>) genes, which provide a visible phenotype at the seedling stage for successful knockouts. Using the optimized protocol, transformation of 648 explants with particle bombardment and 532 explants with <i>Agrobacterium</i> led to a 33% regeneration efficiency. The <i>YSA</i> targets had ambiguous phenotypes, but 60% of regenerated plants for <i>PDS</i> showed an albino phenotype. Sanger sequencing of edited progeny showed a number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions at the gRNA target sites. These results pave the way for more efficient gene editing of <i>tropical japonica</i> rice varieties.
