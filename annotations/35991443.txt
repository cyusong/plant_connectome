While plants are an abundant source of valuable natural products, it is often challenging to produce those products for commercial application. Often organic synthesis is too expensive for a viable commercial product and the biosynthetic pathways are often so complex that transferring them to a microorganism is not trivial or feasible. For plants not suited to agricultural production of natural products, hairy root cultures offer an attractive option for a production platform which offers genetic and biochemical stability, fast growth, and a hormone free culture media. Advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology tools to engineer hairy roots along with bioreactor technology is to a point where commercial application of the technology will soon be realized. We discuss different applications of hairy roots. We also use a case study of the advancements in understanding of the terpenoid indole alkaloid pathway in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> hairy roots to illustrate the advancements and challenges in pathway discovery and in pathway engineering.
