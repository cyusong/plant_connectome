Optimization of plant architecture by modifying stem termination and timing of flowering and maturity of soybean is a promising strategy to improve its adaptability to specific production environments. Therefore, it is important to choose a proper stem termination type and to understand morphological differences between each stem termination type under various environmental conditions. Variations in abruptness of stem termination have been generally classified into three classical genetic types, indeterminate (<i>Dt1</i>), determinate (<i>dt1</i>), and semi-determinate (<i>Dt2</i>). However, an additional stem termination type, termed tall determinate, and its genetic symbol, <i>dt1-t</i>, were introduced about 25 years ago. The tall determinate soybean lines show delayed cessation of apical stem growth and about 50% taller plant heights than the typical determinate soybeans, even though the genetic control of the tall determinate phenotype was found to be allelic to <i>dt1</i>. Despite the potential agronomic merits of the alternative stem termination type, knowledge about the tall determinate soybean remains limited. We clarified the molecular basis of the tall determinate stem termination type and examined potential agronomic merits of the alternative stem type under three different production environments in the US. Sequence analysis of the classical tall determinate soybean lines revealed that the <i>dt1-t</i> allele responsible for tall determinate stem architecture is caused by two of the identified independent missense alleles of <i>dt1, dt1-t1</i> (R130K), and <i>dt1-t2</i> (R62S). Also, from the comparison among soybean accessions belonging to each of the genotype categories for stem termination types, soybean accessions with tall determinate alleles were found to have a high discrepancy rate in phenotyping. Newly developed tall determinate late-maturing soybean germplasm lines had taller plant heights and a greater number of nodes with a similar stem diameter and similar pod density at the apical stem compared to typical determinate soybeans having <i>dt1</i> (R166W) alleles in Southern environments in the US. The phenotype of increased pod-bearing nodes with lodging resistance has the potential to improve yield, especially grown in high yield environments. This study suggests an alternative strategy to remodel the shape of soybean plants, which can possibly lead to yield improvement through the modification of soybean plant architecture.
