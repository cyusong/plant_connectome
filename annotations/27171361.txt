['27171361', 'The MORC family of GHKL ATPases are an enigmatic class of proteins with diverse  chromatin related functions. In Arabidopsis, AtMORC1, AtMORC2, and AtMORC6 act  together in heterodimeric complexes to mediate transcriptional silencing of  methylated DNA elements. Here, we studied Arabidopsis AtMORC4 and AtMORC7. We  found that, in contrast to AtMORC1,2,6, they act to suppress a wide set of  non-methylated protein-coding genes that are enriched for those involved in  pathogen response. Furthermore, atmorc4 atmorc7 double mutants show a pathogen  response phenotype. We found that AtMORC4 and AtMORC7 form homomeric complexes in  vivo and are concentrated in discrete nuclear bodies adjacent to chromocenters.  Analysis of an atmorc1,2,4,5,6,7 hextuple mutant demonstrates that  transcriptional de-repression is largely uncoupled from changes in DNA  methylation in plants devoid of MORC function. However, we also uncover a  requirement for MORC in both DNA methylation and silencing at a small but  distinct subset of RNA-directed DNA methylation target loci. These regions are  characterized by poised transcriptional potential and a low density of sites for  symmetric cytosine methylation. These results provide insight into the biological  function of MORC proteins in higher eukaryotes.', '2016 May', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1005998', 'Jacobsen']
