['30523112', 'DNA methylation generally functions as a repressive transcriptional signal, but  it is also known to activate gene expression. In either case, the downstream  factors remain largely unknown. By using comparative interactomics, we isolated  proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana that associate with methylated DNA. Two  SU(VAR)3-9 homologs, the transcriptional antisilencing factor SUVH1, and SUVH3,  were among the methyl reader candidates. SUVH1 and SUVH3 bound methylated DNA in  vitro, were associated with euchromatic methylation in vivo, and formed a complex  with two DNAJ domain-containing homologs, DNAJ1 and DNAJ2. Ectopic recruitment of  DNAJ1 enhanced gene transcription in plants, yeast, and mammals. Thus, the SUVH  proteins bind to methylated DNA and recruit the DNAJ proteins to enhance proximal  gene expression, thereby counteracting the repressive effects of transposon  insertion near genes.', '2018 Dec 7', 'Science', '10.1126/science.aar7854', 'ORCID:']
