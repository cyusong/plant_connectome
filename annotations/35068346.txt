Plant-specific TCP transcription factors play an essential role in plant growth and development. They can regulate leaf curvature, flower symmetry and the synthesis of secondary metabolites. The flavonoids in <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> leaf are one of the main medicinally bioactivate compounds, which have pharmacological and beneficial health effects for humans. In this study, a total of 13 <i>TCP</i> genes were identified in <i>G. biloba</i>, and 5 of them belonged to PCF subclades (<i>GbTCP03, GbTCP07, GbTCP05, GbTCP13, GbTCP02</i>) while others belonged to CIN (<i>GbTCP01, GbTCP04, GbTCP06, GbTCP08, GbTCP09, GbTCP10, GbTCP11, GbTCP12</i>) subclades according to phylogenetic analysis. Numerous <i>cis</i>-acting elements related to various biotic and abiotic signals were predicted on the promoters by <i>cis</i>-element analysis, suggesting that the expression of <i>GbTCPs</i> might be co-regulated by multiple signals. Transcript abundance analysis exhibited that most of <i>GbTCPs</i> responded to multiple phytohormones. Among them, the relative expression levels of <i>GbTCP06, GbTCP11</i>, and <i>GbTCP13</i> were found to be significantly influenced by exogenous ABA, SA and MeJA application. In addition, a total of 126 miRNAs were predicted to target 9 <i>TCPs</i> (including <i>GbTCP01, GbTCP02, GbTCP04, GbTCP05, GbTCP06, GbTCP08, GbTCP11, GbTCP12, GbTCP13</i>). The correlation analysis between the expression level of <i>GbTCPs</i> and the flavonoid contents showed that <i>GbTCP03, GbTCP04, GbTCP07</i> might involve in flavonoid biosynthesis in <i>G. biloba</i>. In short, this study mainly provided a theoretical foundation for better understanding the potential function of <i>TCPs</i> in <i>G. biloba</i>.
