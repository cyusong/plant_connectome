Due to their sessile lifestyle, plants are especially exposed to various stresses, including genotoxic stress, which results in altered genome integrity. Upon the detection of DNA damage, distinct cellular responses lead to cell cycle arrest and the induction of DNA repair mechanisms. Interestingly, it has been shown that some cell cycle regulators are not only required for meristem activity and plant development but are also key to cope with the occurrence of DNA lesions. In this review, we first summarize some important regulatory steps of the plant cell cycle and present a brief overview of the DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms. Then, the role played by some cell cycle regulators at the interface between the cell cycle and DNA damage responses is discussed more specifically.

Cell cycle: !regulates! Plant development
DNA damage: !induces! Cell cycle arrest
Cell cycle regulators: !required for! Meristem activity 
Cell cycle regulators: !key to! Cope with DNA lesions
Cell cycle: !interfaces with! DNA damage response
