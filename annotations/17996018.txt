['17996018', "Pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) is a ubiquitous, low-abundance metabolic  enzyme of undetermined function in C3 plants. Its activity in C3 chloroplasts is  light-regulated via reversible phosphorylation of an active-site Thr residue by  the PPDK regulatory protein (RP), a most unusual bifunctional protein kinase  (PK)/protein phosphatase (PP). In this paper we document the molecular cloning  and functional analysis of the two unique C3 RPs in Arabidopsis thaliana. The  first of these, AtRP1, encodes a typical chloroplast-targeted, bifunctional  C4-like RP. The second RP gene, AtRP2, encodes a monofunctional polypeptide that  possesses in vitro RP-like PK activity but lacks PP activity, and is localized in  the cytosol. Notably, the deduced primary structures of these two highly  homologous polypeptides are devoid of any canonical subdomain structure that  unifies all known eukaryotic and prokaryotic Ser/Thr PKs into one of three  superfamilies, despite the direct demonstration that AtRP1 is functionally a  member of this group. Instead, these C3 RPs and the related C4 plant homologues  encode a conserved, centrally positioned, approximately 260-residue sequence  currently described as the 'domain of unknown function 299' (DUF 299). We propose  that vascular plant RPs form a unique protein kinase family now designated as the  DUF 299 gene family.", '2008 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03366.x', 'Chollet']
