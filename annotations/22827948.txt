Histidine kinases have been shown to mediate responses to endogenous and exogenous stimuli in organisms such as yeast, bacteria and plants. In the model plant Arabidopsis, histidine kinases have been shown to function in hormone signaling, and abiotic and biotic stress responses. More recently, the least characterized of the Arabidopsis histidine kinases, AHK5, was demonstrated to function in resistance toward the virulent bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (PstDC3000) and the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea, and as a negative regulator of tolerance toward salinity. Here, we present data which indicate that AHK5 also impacts on drought stress resistance and on the outcome of an incompatible interaction with avrRpm1-expressing PstDC3000 (PstDC3000 (avrRpm1)). We present a model which proposes a role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hormones in integrating abiotic and biotic stress responses via AHK5.
