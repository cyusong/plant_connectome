The shift of dark-grown seedlings into light causes enormous transcriptome changes followed by a dramatic developmental transition. Here, we show that microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis also undergoes regulatory changes during de-etiolation. Etiolated seedlings maintain low levels of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) and miRNA processing core proteins, such as Dicer-like 1, SERRATE, and HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1, whereas during de-etiolation both pri-miRNAs and the processing components accumulate to high levels. However, the levels of most miRNAs do not notably increase in response to light. To reconcile this inconsistency, we demonstrated that an unknown suppressor decreases miRNA-processing activity and light-induced SMALL RNA DEGRADING NUCLEASE 1 shortens the half-life of several miRNAs in de-etiolated seedlings. Taken together, these data suggest a novel mechanism, miRNA-biogenetic inconsistency, which accounts for the intricacy of miRNA biogenesis during de-etiolation. This mechanism is essential for the survival of de-etiolated seedlings after long-term skotomorphogenesis and their optimal adaptation to ever-changing light conditions.

pri-miRNA: !accumulates to high levels! during de-etiolation 
unknown suppressor: !decreases! miRNA-processing activity 
SMALL RNA DEGRADING NUCLEASE 1: !shortens! half-life of several miRNAs
