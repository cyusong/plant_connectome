The receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) pleiotropically affects plant reproduction, development, and stress tolerance. We recently showed that the FER ligand RALF1 promotes stomatal closure and inhibits stomatal opening in a G-protein-dependent manner. FER responses have been designated as kinase-dependent or kinase-independent, based largely on fer complementation assays employing a kinase-dead FERK565R. Our quantification of FERK565R-GFP transcript and FERK565R-GFP protein in fer complementation lines reveal that, even within individual complementation lines, different levels of FERK565R expression prevail. FERK565R-GFP expression comparable to that of FER in Col-0 plants fail to elicit complementation of either fer rosette phenotypes or RALF1-elicited stomatal movements, whereas overexpression levels of FERK565R-GFP result in complementation. These results suggest possible alternative interpretations of previous conclusions regarding kinase-independent FER signaling.
