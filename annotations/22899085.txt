Plant stomata function in disease resistance by restricting bacteria entry inside leaves. During plant-bacteria interactions, stomatal closure is initiated by the recognition of Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns (MAMPs). Recently, we have shown that the Lectin Receptor Kinase V.5 (LecRK-V.5) negatively regulates bacterium- and MAMP-induced stomatal closure upstream of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production mediated by abscisic acid signaling. Closed stomata in lecrk-V.5 mutants are correlated with constitutive high level of ROS in guard cells. Consequently, lecrk-V.5 mutants are more resistant to hemi-biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000). In this report, we further investigate the role of LecRK-V.5 in resistance against necrotrophic bacteria Pectobacterium carotovorum ssp. carotovorum (Pcc). Upon surface-inoculation lecrk-V.5 mutants exhibited enhanced resistance against Pcc whereas a wild-type level of resistance was observed using infiltration-inoculation, an inoculation method that bypasses the epidermal barrier. Enhanced resistance of dip-inoculated lecrk-V.5 mutants against necrotrophic bacteria, that induce different defense responses than hemi-biotrophic bacteria, further suggests a possible role for LecRK-V.5 in stomatal immunity.
