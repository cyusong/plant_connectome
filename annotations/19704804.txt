SUCROSE SYNTHASE (SUS: EC 2.4.1.13), a key enzyme in plant sucrose catabolism, is uniquely able to mobilize sucrose into multiple pathways involved in metabolic, structural, and storage functions. Our research indicates that the biological function of SUS may extend beyond its catalytic activity. This inference is based on the following observations: (a) tissue-specific, isoform-dependent and metabolically-regulated association of SUS with mitochondria and (b) isoform-specific and anoxia-responsive interaction of SUS with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), the major outer mitochondrial membrane protein. More recent work shows that both VDAC and SUS are also localized to the nucleus in maize seedling tissues. Their intricate regulation under anoxia indicates that these two proteins may have a role in inter-compartmental signaling.
