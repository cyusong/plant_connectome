During somatic embryogenesis (SE), somatic cells initiate embryogenic development under appropriate conditions. Uniconazole, a plant growth regulator, was found to inhibit the proliferation of callus but promoted the conversion of callus into an embryogenic callus (EC) in cotton. The supplementation of uniconazole in the culture medium significantly suppressed the endogenous auxin [indole acetic acid (IAA)] level in callus tissues in both the callus initiation and proliferation stage but enhanced the abscisic acid (ABA) level only in the callus proliferation stage. Exogenous ABA and uniconazole showed cooperative effects on promoting the differentiation rate of callus into EC. These findings were verified by RNA-seq analysis, which elucidated that the genes involved in the IAA biosynthesis, metabolism, and signaling, and ABA metabolism pathways were regulated by uniconazole during the callus development and SE. Overall, the results suggest that uniconazole could modulate callus proliferation and callus differentiation rate by regulating the endogenous levels of IAA and ABA.
