Plants live in association with complex populations of microorganisms, including Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) that confer to plants an improved growth and enhanced stress tolerance. This large and diverse group includes endophytic bacteria that are able to colonize the internal tissues of plants. In the present study, we have isolated a nonrhizobial species from surface sterilized root nodules of <i>Retama monosperma</i>, a perennial leguminous species growing in poor and high salinity soils. Sequencing of its genome reveals this endophytic bacterium is a <i>Bacillus megaterium</i> strain (RmBm31) that possesses a wide range of genomic features linked to plant growth promotion. Furthermore, we show that RmBm31 is able to increase the biomass and positively modify the root architecture of seedlings of the model plant species <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> both in physical contact with its roots and <i>via</i> the production of volatile organic compounds. Lastly, we investigated the molecular mechanisms implicated in RmBm31 plant beneficial effects by carrying out a transcriptional analysis on a comprehensive set of phytohormone-responsive marker genes. Altogether, our results demonstrate that RmBm31 displays plant growth-promoting traits of potential interest for agricultural applications.
