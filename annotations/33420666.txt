Inducible lineage analysis and cell ablation via conditional toxin expression in cells expressing the DORNRÖSCHEN-LIKE transcription factor represent an effective and complementary adjunct to conventional methods of functional gene analysis. Classical methods of functional gene analysis via mutational and expression studies possess inherent limitations, and therefore, the function of a large proportion of transcription factors remains unknown. We have employed two complementary, indirect methods to obtain functional information for the AP2/ERF transcription factor DORNRÖSCHEN-LIKE (DRNL), which is dynamically expressed in flowers and marks lateral organ founder cells. An inducible, two-component Cre-Lox system was used to express beta-glucuronidase GUS in cells expressing DRNL, to perform a sector analysis that reveals lineages of cells that transiently expressed DRNL throughout plant development. In a complementary approach, an inducible system was used to ablate cells expressing DRNL using diphtheria toxin A chain, to visualise the phenotypic consequences. These complementary analyses demonstrate that DRNL functionally marks founder cells of leaves and floral organs. Clonal sectors also included the vasculature of the leaves and petals, implicating a previously unidentified role for DRNL in provasculature development, which was confirmed in cotyledons by closer analysis of drnl mutants. Our findings demonstrate that inducible gene-specific lineage analysis and cell ablation via conditional toxin expression represent an effective and informative adjunct to conventional methods of functional gene analysis.
