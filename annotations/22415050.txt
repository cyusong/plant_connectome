We recently developed the first algorithms specifically for plants to predict proteins carrying peroxisome targeting signals type 1 (PTS1) from genome sequences. As validated experimentally, the prediction methods are able to correctly predict unknown peroxisomal Arabidopsis proteins and to infer novel PTS1 tripeptides. The high prediction performance is primarily determined by the large number and sequence diversity of the underlying positive example sequences, which mainly derived from EST databases. However, a few constructs remained cytosolic in experimental validation studies, indicating sequencing errors in some ESTs. To identify erroneous sequences, we validated subcellular targeting of additional positive example sequences in the present study. Moreover, we analyzed the distribution of prediction scores separately for each orthologous group of PTS1 proteins, which generally resembled normal distributions with group-specific mean values. The cytosolic sequences commonly represented outliers of low prediction scores and were located at the very tail of a fitted normal distribution. Three statistical methods for identifying outliers were compared in terms of sensitivity and specificity." Their combined application allows elimination of erroneous ESTs from positive example data sets. This new post-validation method will further improve the prediction accuracy of both PTS1 and PTS2 protein prediction models for plants, fungi, and mammals.
