['22751362', 'To date, Arabidopsis purple acid phosphatase 2 (AtPAP2) is the only known plant  protein that is dual-targeted to chloroplasts and mitochondria by a C-terminal  targeting signal. Using in vitro organelle import and green fluorescence protein  (GFP) localization assays, we showed that AtPAP2 is located on, but not imported  across the outer membrane (OM) of chloroplasts and mitochondria and exposed its  N-terminal enzymatic domain to the cytosol. It was also found that a short  stretch of 30 amino acids (a.a.) at the C-terminal region (a.a. 615-644) that  contains a stretch of 18 hydrophobic residues, a WYAK motif and 8 hydrophilic  residues is sufficient for dual-targeting. Mutation of WYAK to WYAE had no effect  on dual-targeting ability suggesting that the charge within this flanking region  alone is not an important determinant for dual-targeting.
