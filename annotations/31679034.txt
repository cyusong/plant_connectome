The sessile lifestyle of plants requires them to cope with a multitude of stresses in situ. In response to diverse environmental and intracellular cues, plant cells respond by massive reprogramming of transcription and translation of stress response regulators, many of which rely on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) processing. This increased protein synthesis could exceed the capacity of precise protein quality control, leading to the accumulation of unfolded and/or misfolded proteins that triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). Such cellular stress responses are multilayered and executed in different cellular compartments. Here, we will discuss the three main branches of UPR signaling in diverse eukaryotic systems, and describe various levels of ER stress response regulation that encompass transcriptional gene regulation by master transcription factors, post-transcriptional activities including cytoplasmic splicing, translational control, and multiple post-translational events such as peptide modifications and cleavage. In addition, we will discuss the roles of plant ER stress sensors in abiotic and biotic stress responses and speculate on the future prospects of engineering these signaling events for heightened stress tolerance.
