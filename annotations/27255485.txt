Photosynthesis is a high-rate redox metabolic process that is subjected to rapid changes in input parameters, particularly light. Rapid transients of photon capture, electron fluxes, and redox potentials during photosynthesis cause reactive oxygen species (ROS) to be released, including singlet oxygen, superoxide anion radicals, and hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the photosynthesizing chloroplast functions as a conditional source of important redox and ROS information, which is exploited to tune processes both inside the chloroplast and, following retrograde release or processing, in the cytosol and nucleus. Analyses of mutants and comparative transcriptome profiling have led to the identification of these processes and associated players and have allowed the specificity and generality of response patterns to be defined. The release of ROS and oxidation products, envelope permeabilization (for larger molecules), and metabolic interference with mitochondria and peroxisomes produce an intricate ROS and redox signature, which controls acclimation processes. This photosynthesis-related ROS and redox information feeds into various pathways (e.g. the mitogen-activated protein kinase and OXI1 signaling pathways) and controls processes such as gene expression and translation.
