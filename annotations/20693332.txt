Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) plants have short and long glandular trichomes. There is evidence that tobacco trichomes play several roles in the defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. cDNA libraries were constructed from control and cadmium (Cd)-treated leaf trichomes. Almost 2,000 expressed sequence tag (EST) cDNA clones were sequenced to analyze gene expression in control and Cd-treated leaf trichomes. Genes for stress response as well as for primary metabolism scored highly, indicating that the trichome is a biologically active and stress-responsive tissue. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that antipathogenic T-phylloplanin-like proteins, glutathione peroxidase and several classes of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins were expressed specifically or dominantly in trichomes. Cysteine-rich PR proteins, such as non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) and metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitors, are candidates for the sequestration of metals. The expression of osmotin and thaumatin-like proteins was induced by Cd treatment in both leaves and trichomes. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that glutathione levels in tip cells of both long and short trichomes were higher than those in other types of leaf cells, indicating the presence of an active sulfur-dependent protective system in trichomes. Our results revealed that the trichome-specific transcriptome approach is a powerful tool to investigate the defensive functions of trichomes against both abiotic and biotic stress. Trichomes are shown to be an enriched source of useful genes for molecular breeding towards stress-tolerant plants.
