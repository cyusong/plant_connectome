Salicylic acid (SA) is closely related to disease resistance of plants. WRKY transcription factors have been linked to the growth and development of plants, especially under stress conditions. However, the regulatory mechanism of WRKY proteins involved in SA production and disease resistance in apple is not clear. In this study, <i>MdPBS3.1</i> responded to <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i> and enhanced resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i>. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, yeast one-hybrid assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR demonstrated that MdWRKY46 can directly bind to a W-box motif in the promoter of <i>MdPBS3.1</i>. Glucuronidase transactivation and luciferase analysis further showed that MdWRKY46 can activate the expression of <i>MdPBS3.1</i>. Finally, <i>B. dothidea</i> inoculation in transgenic apple calli and fruits revealed that MdWRKY46 improved resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> by the transcriptional activation of <i>MdPBS3.1</i>. Viral vector-based transformation assays indicated that MdWRKY46 elevates SA content and transcription of SA-related genes, including <i>MdPR1</i>, <i>MdPR5</i>, and <i>MdNPR1</i> in an <i>MdPBS3.1</i>-dependent way. These findings provide new insights into how MdWRKY46 regulates plant resistance to <i>B. dothidea</i> through the SA signaling pathway.
