Caleosins, mostly found in lipid droplets of seeds and leaves, are believed to play physiological roles through their enzymatic capacities to produce oxylipins. We recently identified the caleosin RD20 as a peroxygenase reducing endogenous fatty acid hydroperoxides into their corresponding alcohols. Such oxylipins confer tolerance to oxidative stress by decreasing reactive oxygen species accumulation and by minimizing cell death. RD20 expression being induced by pathogens, we have examined the mode of action of this caleosin in response to biotic stress. Plants overexpressing RD20 exhibited an alteration of their leaf cuticle wax components and an increased resistance to the fungus Alternaria brassicicola. Conversely, silencing RD20 led to an enhanced propagation of the fungus and to reduced severity of the damages caused by the inoculation of the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato. We discuss these findings and propose that the major function of RD20 is to generate oxylipins modulating oxidative status and cell death.
