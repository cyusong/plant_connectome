['35013278', 'In flowering plants, hydration of desiccated pollen grains on stigma is a  prerequisite for pollen germination, during which pollen increase markedly in  volume through water uptake, requiring them to survive hypoosmotic shock to  maintain cellular integrity. However, the mechanisms behind the adaptation of  pollen to this hypoosmotic challenge are largely unknown. Here, we identify the  Qc-SNARE protein SYP72, which is specifically expressed in male gametophytes, as  a critical regulator of pollen survival upon hypoosmotic shock during hydration.  SYP72 interacts with the MSCS-LIKE 8 (MSL8) and is required for its localization  to the plasma membrane. Intraspecies and interspecies genetic complementation  experiments reveal that SYP72 paralogs and orthologs from green algae to  angiosperms display conserved molecular functions and rescue the defects of  Arabidopsis syp72 mutant pollen facing hypoosmotic shock following hydration. Our  findings demonstrate a critical role for SYP72 in pollen resistance to  hypoosmotic shock through the MSL8 cascade during pollen hydration.', '2022 Jan 10', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-021-27757-9', 'ORCID:']
