To date, haemoglobins (Hbs) have been shown to exist in all kingdoms of life. The least studied and understood groups are plant non-symbiotic haemoglobins (nsHbs) and the recently found plant truncated Hbs (trHbs). From a biotechnological point of view, the best characterized and almost exclusively applied Hb is the bacterial Vitreoscilla haemoglobin (VHb). In this review, the present state of knowledge of structural features and ligand binding kinetics of plant nsHbs and trHbs and their proposed roles as oxygen carriers, oxygen sensors, and for oxygen storage, in nitric oxide (NO) detoxification, and in peroxidase activity are described. Furthermore, in order to predict the functioning of plant Hbs, their characteristics will be compared with those of the better known bacterial globins. In this context, the effects of heterologous applications of VHb on plants are reviewed. Finally, the challenging future of plant Hb research is discussed.
