['33098690', 'Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins form a large family of proteins targeted  to organelles, where they post-transcriptionally modulate gene expression through  binding to specific RNA sequences. Among them, the mitochondria-targeted  restorer-of-fertility (Rf) PPRs inhibit peculiar mitochondrial genes that are  detrimental to male gametes and cause cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). Here, we  revealed three nuclear loci involved in CMS in a cross between two distant  Arabidopsis thaliana strains, Sha and Cvi-0. We identified the causal gene at one  of these loci as RFL24, a conserved gene encoding a PPR protein related to known  Rf PPRs. By analysing fertile revertants obtained in a male sterile background,  we demonstrate that RFL24 promotes pollen abortion, in contrast with the  previously described Rf PPRs, which allow pollen to survive in the presence of a  sterilizing cytoplasm. We show that the sterility caused by the RFL24 Cvi-0  allele results from higher expression of the gene during early pollen  development. Finally, we predict a binding site for RFL24 upstream of two  mitochondrial genes, the CMS gene and the important gene cob. These results  suggest that the conservation of RFL24 is linked to a primary role of ensuring a  proper functioning of mitochondria, and that it was subsequently diverted by the  CMS gene to its benefit.', '2021 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.15045', 'ORCID:']
