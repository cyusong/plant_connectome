['35819066', 'Multiple internal and external signals modulate the metabolism, intercellular  transport and signaling of the phytohormone auxin. Considering this complexity,  it remains largely unknown how plant cells monitor and ensure the homeostasis of  auxin responses. PIN-LIKES (PILS) intracellular auxin transport facilitators at  the endoplasmic reticulum are suitable candidates to buffer cellular auxin  responses because they limit nuclear abundance and signaling of auxin. We used  forward genetics to identify gloomy and shiny pils (gasp) mutants that define the  PILS6 protein abundance in a post-translational manner. Here, we show that GASP1  encodes an uncharacterized RING/U-box superfamily protein that impacts on auxin  signaling output. The low auxin signaling in gasp1 mutants correlates with  reduced abundance of PILS5 and PILS6 proteins. Mechanistically, we show that high  and low auxin conditions increase and reduce PILS6 protein levels, respectively.  Accordingly, non-optimum auxin concentrations are buffered by alterations in  PILS6 abundance, consequently leading to homeostatic auxin output regulation. We  envision that this feedback mechanism provides robustness to auxin-dependent  plant development.', '2022 Jul 1', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.200929', 'Kleine-Vehn']
