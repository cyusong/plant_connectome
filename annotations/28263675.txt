Bud outgrowth is under the intricate control of environmental and endogenous factors. In a recent paper, <sup>1</sup> we demonstrated that light perceived by Rosa buds triggers cytokinins (CK) synthesis within 3 hours in the adjacent node followed by their transport to the bud. There, CK control expression of a set of major genes (strigolactones-, auxin-, sugar sink strength-, cells division and elongation-related genes) leading to bud outgrowth in light. Conversely, under dark condition, CK accumulation and transport to the bud are repressed and no bud outgrowth occurs. In this paper, we show that the 3 expansin genes RhEXPA1,2,3 are under the control of both light and CK during bud outgrowth. In silico analysis of promoter sequences highlights 2 regions enriched in light and CK cis-regulatory elements as well as a specific cis-element in pRhEXPA3, potentially responsible for the expression patterns observed in response to CK and light.
