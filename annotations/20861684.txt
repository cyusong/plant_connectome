Stem growth kinetics were measured in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and Arabidopsis thaliana using highly-sensitive monitoring with 5-minute resolution, in darkness and in response to a short, single pulse of UV-C illumination. The results show that UV-C, like blue light, induces a rapid decrease in seedling growth rate. The fluence-response kinetics and time course were similar to the phototropin1 mediated response observed following a blue pulse. Arabidopsis seedlings were used to assess the genetic mechanism of this response. The phot1 mutant exhibited defects in stem growth rate inhibition, with sustained growth inhibition completely absent following specific treatments. The cryptochrome and phytochrome mutants exhibited responses comparable to wild type, suggesting that these receptor classes do not contribute to this response. The work demonstrates in two species that UV-C has an effect on a rapid plant photomorphogenic response and that the response is partially mediated by the phot1 photoreceptor.

UV-C: !induces! decrease in seedling growth rate
phot1: !mediates! response to UV-C
cryptochrome: !does not contribute to! response to UV-C
phytochrome: !does not contribute to! response to UV-C
