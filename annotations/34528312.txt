Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) are one of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors in plants, but the functions of most CMLs remain unknown. The regulation of cold tolerance and flowering time by MtCML42 in Medicago truncatula and the underlying mechanisms were investigated using MtCML42-overexpressing plants and cml42 Medicago mutants with a Tnt1 retrotransposon insertion. Compared with the wild type (WT), MtCML42-overexpressing lines had increased cold tolerance, whereas cml42 mutants showed decreased cold tolerance. The impaired cold tolerance in cml42 could b complemented by MtCML42 expression. The transcript levels of MtCBF1, MtCBF4, MtCOR413, MtCAS15, MtLTI6A, MtGolS1 and MtGolS2 and the concentrations of raffinose and sucrose were increased in response to cold treatment, whereas higher levels were observed in MtCML42-overexpressing lines and lower levels were observed in cml42 mutants. In addition, early flowering with upregulated MtFTa1 and downregulated MtABI5 transcripts was observed in MtCML42-overexpressing lines, whereas delayed flowering with downregulated MtFTa1 and upregulated MtABI5 was observed in cml42. MtABI5 expression could complement the flowering phenotype in the Arabidopsis mutant abi5. Our results suggest that MtCML42 positively regulates MtCBF1 and MtCBF4 expression, which in turn upregulates the expression of some COR genes, MtGolS1 and MtGolS2, which leads to raffinose accumulation and increased cold tolerance. MtCML42 regulates flowering time through sequentially downregulating MtABI5 and upregulating MtFTa1 expression.
