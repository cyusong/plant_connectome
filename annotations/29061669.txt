['29061669', 'Histone deacetylases have central functions in regulating stress defenses and  development in plants. However, the knowledge about the deacetylase functions is  largely limited to histones, although these enzymes were found in diverse  subcellular compartments. In this study, we determined the proteome-wide  signatures of the RPD3/HDA1 class of histone deacetylases in Arabidopsis Relative  quantification of the changes in the lysine acetylation levels was determined on  a proteome-wide scale after treatment of Arabidopsis leaves with deacetylase  inhibitors apicidin and trichostatin A. We identified 91 new acetylated candidate  proteins other than histones, which are potential substrates of the  RPD3/HDA1-like histone deacetylases in Arabidopsis, of which at least 30 of these  proteins function in nucleic acid binding. Furthermore, our analysis revealed  that histone deacetylase 14 (HDA14) is the first organellar-localized RPD3/HDA1  class protein found to reside in the chloroplasts and that the majority of its  protein targets have functions in photosynthesis. Finally, the analysis of HDA14  loss-of-function mutants revealed that the activation state of RuBisCO is  controlled by lysine acetylation of RuBisCO activase under low-light conditions.', '2017 Oct 23', 'Mol Syst Biol', '10.15252/msb.20177819', 'ORCID:']
