['28229965', 'DNA methylation, mediated by double-stranded RNA, is a conserved epigenetic  phenomenon that protects a genome from transposons, silences unwanted genes and  has a paramount function in plant or animal development. Methyl CpG binding  domain proteins are members of a class of proteins that bind to methylated DNA.  The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes 13 methyl CpG binding domain (MBD)  proteins, but the molecular/biological functions of most of these proteins are  still not clear. In the present study, we identified four proteins that interact  with AtMBD6. Interestingly, three of them contain RNA binding domains and are  co-localized with AtMBD6 in the nucleus. The interacting partners includes  AtRPS2C (a 40S ribosomal protein), AtNTF2 (nuclear transport factor 2) and AtAGO4  (Argonoute 4). The fourth protein that physically interacts with AtMBD6 is a  histone-modifying enzyme, histone deacetylase 6 (AtHDA6), which is a known  component of the RNA-mediated gene silencing system. Analysis of genomic DNA  methylation in the atmbd6, atrps2c and atntf2 mutants, using  methylation-sensitive PCR detected decreased DNA methylation at miRNA/siRNA  producing loci, pseudogenes and other targets of RNA-directed DNA methylation.  Our results indicate that AtMBD6 is involved in RNA-mediated gene silencing and  it binds to RNA binding proteins like AtRPS2C, AtAGO4 and AtNTF2. AtMBD6 also  interacts with histone deacetylase AtHDA6 that might have a role in chromatin  condensation at the targets of RdDM.', '2017 Mar', 'J Biosci', '10.1007/s12038-016-9658-1', 'Sharma']
