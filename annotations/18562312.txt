['18562312', 'The circadian clock controls the period, phasing, and amplitude of processes that  oscillate with a near 24-h rhythm. One core group of clock components in  Arabidopsis that controls the pace of the central oscillator is comprised of five  PRR (pseudo-response regulator) proteins whose biochemical function in the clock  remains unclear. Peak expression of TOC1 (timing of cab expression 1)/PRR1, PRR3,  PRR5, PRR7, and PRR9 are each phased differently over the course of the day and  loss of any PRR protein alters period. Here we show that, together with TOC1,  PRR5 is the only other likely proteolytic substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase  SCF(ZTL) within this PRR family. We further demonstrate a functional significance  for the phosphorylated forms of PRR5, TOC1, and PRR3. Each PRR protein examined  is nuclear-localized and is differentially phosphorylated over the circadian  cycle. The more highly phosphorylated forms of PRR5 and TOC1 interact best with  the F-box protein ZTL (ZEITLUPE), suggesting a mechanism to modulate their  proteolysis. In vivo degradation of both PRR5 and ZTL is inhibited by blue light,  likely the result of blue light photoperception by ZTL. TOC1 and PRR3 interact in  vivo and phosphorylation of both is necessary for their optimal binding in vitro.  Additionally, because PRR3 and ZTL both interact with TOC1 in vivo via the TOC1 N  terminus, taken together these data suggest that the TOC1/PRR3  phosphorylation-dependent interaction may protect TOC1 from ZTL-mediated  degradation, resulting in an enhanced amplitude of TOC1 cycling.', '2008 Aug 22', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M803471200', 'Somers']
