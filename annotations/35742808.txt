Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play essential roles in plants by modulating the expression of genes at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. In recent years, ncRNAs have been recognized as crucial regulators for growth and development in forest trees, and ncRNAs that respond to various abiotic stresses are now under intense study. In this review, we summarized recent advances in the understanding of abiotic stress-responsive microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in forest trees. Furthermore, we analyzed the intersection of miRNAs, and epigenetic modified ncRNAs of forest trees in response to abiotic stress. In particular, the abiotic stress-related lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network of forest trees was explored.
