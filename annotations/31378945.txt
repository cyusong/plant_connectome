The growth of rice in submerged soils depends on its ability to form continuous gas channels-aerenchyma-through which oxygen (O<sub>2</sub> ) diffuses from the shoots to aerate the roots. Less well understood is the extent to which aerenchyma permits venting of respiratory carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub> ) in the opposite direction. Large, potentially toxic concentrations of dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> develop in submerged rice soils. We show using X-ray computed tomography and image-based mathematical modelling that CO<sub>2</sub> venting through rice roots is far greater than thought hitherto. We found rates of venting equivalent to a third of the daily CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in photosynthesis. Without this venting through the roots, the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and associated bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ) in root cells would have been well above levels known to be toxic to roots. Removal of CO<sub>2</sub> and hence carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> ) from the soil was sufficient to increase the pH in the rhizosphere close to the roots by 0.7 units, which is sufficient to solubilize or immobilize various nutrients and toxicants. A sensitivity analysis of the model showed that such changes are expected for a wide range of plant and soil conditions.
