In plants, a family of terpene synthases (TPSs) is responsible for the biosynthesis of terpenes and contributes to species-specific diversity of volatile organic compounds, which play essential roles in fitness of plants. However, little is known about the <i>TPS</i> gene family in peach and/or nectarine (<i>Prunus persica</i> L.). In this study, we identified 40 <i>PpTPS</i> genes in peach genome v2.0. Although these <i>PpTPSs</i> could be clustered into five classes, they distribute in several gene clusters of three chromosomes, share conserved exon-intron organizations, and code similar protein motifs. Thirty-five <i>PpTPSs</i>, especially <i>PpTPS2</i>, <i>PpTPS23</i>, <i>PpTPS17</i>, <i>PpTPS18</i>, and <i>PpTPS19</i>, altered their transcript levels after inoculation with <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i>, a cause of peach gummosis, compared to the mock treatments, which might further affect the contents of 133 terpenoids at 48 hours and/or 84 hours post inoculations in the current-year shoots of 'Huyou018', a highly susceptible nectarine cultivar. Moreover, about fifteen <i>PpTPSs</i>, such as <i>PpTPS1</i>, <i>PpTPS2</i>, <i>PpTPS3</i>, and <i>PpTPS5</i>, showed distinct expression patterns during fruit development and ripening in two peach cultivars, yellow-fleshed 'Jinchun' and white-fleshed 'Hikawa Hakuho'. Among them, the transcription level of chloroplast-localized <i>PpTPS3</i> was obviously related to the content of linalool in fruit pulps. In addition, elevated concentrations (0.1 g/L to 1.0 g/L) of linalool showed antifungal activities in PDA medium. These results improve our understanding of peach <i>PpTPS</i> genes and their potential roles in defense responses against pathogens.
