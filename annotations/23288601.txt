A forwards genetic screen of a chemically mutated plant population identified mitochondrial RNA editing factor 10 (MEF10) in Arabidopsis thaliana. MEF10 is a trans-factor required specifically for the C to U editing of site nad2-842. The MEF10 protein is characterized by a stretch of pentatricopeptide repeats (PPR) and a C-terminal extension domain ending with the amino acids DYW. Editing is lost in mutant plants but is recovered by transgenic introduction of an intact MEF10 gene. The MEF10 protein interacts with multiple organellar RNA editing factor 8 (MORF8) but not with other mitochondrial MORF proteins in yeast two hybrid assays. These results support the model that specific combinations of MORF and MEF proteins are involved in RNA editing in plant mitochondria.
