Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is a conserved immune response in Arabidopsis primarily mediated by respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RBOHD), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase associated with the plasma membrane. A rapid increase in NADPH is necessary to fuel RBOHD proteins and thus maintain ROS production. However, the molecular mechanism by which NADPH is generated to fuel RBOHD remains unclear. In this study, we isolated a new mutant allele of FLAGELLIN-INSENSITIVE 4 (FIN4), which encodes the first enzyme in de novo NAD biosynthesis. fin4 mutants show reduced NADPH levels and impaired ROS production. However, FIN4 and other genes involved in NAD- and NADPH-generating pathways are not highly upregulated upon elicitor treatment, raising a possibility that a cytosolic NADP-linked dehydrogenase might be post-transcriptionally activated to maintain the NADPH supply close to RBOHD. To verify this possibility, we isolated the proteins associated with RPM1-INDUCED PROTEIN KINASE (RIPK), a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase that regulates broad-spectrum ROS signaling in plant immunity, and identified NADP-malic enzyme 2 (NADP-ME2), an NADPH-generating enzyme. Compared with wild-type plants, nadp-me2 mutants display decreased NADP-ME activity, lower NADPH levels, and reduced ROS production in response to immune elicitors. Furthermore, we found that RIPK can directly phosphorylate NADP-ME2 and enhance its activity in vitro. The phosphorylation of the NADP-ME2 S371 residue contributes to ROS production upon immune elicitor treatment and susceptibility to the necrotrophic bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum. Collectively, our study suggests that RIPK phosphorylates and activates NADP-ME2 to rapidly increase cytosolic NADPH, thus fueling RBOHD to sustain ROS production in plant immunity.
