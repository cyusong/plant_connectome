['16483618', "A cDNA encoding a homolog of mammalian serine racemase, a unique enzyme in  eukaryotes, was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana and expressed in Escherichia  coli cells. The gene product, of which the amino acid residues for binding  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) are conserved in this as well as mammalian serine  racemases, catalyzes not only serine racemization but also dehydration of serine  to pyruvate. The enzyme is a homodimer and requires PLP and divalent cations,  Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, or Ni2+, at alkaline pH for both activities. The  racemization process is highly specific toward L-serine, whereas L-alanine,  L-arginine, and L-glutamine were poor substrates. The Vmax/Km values for racemase  activity of L- and D-serine are 2.0 and 1.4 nmol/mg/min/mM, respectively, and  those values for L- and D-serine on dehydratase activity are 13 and 5.3  nmol/mg/min/mM, i.e. consistent with the theory of racemization reaction and the  specificity of dehydration toward L-serine. Hybridization analysis showed that  the serine racemase gene was expressed in various organs of A. thaliana.", '2006 Apr', 'Phytochemistry', '10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.01.003', 'Sugimoto']
