The genus <i>Allium</i>, with over 900 species, is one of the largest monocotyledonous genera and is widely accepted with 15 recognized subgenera and 72 sections. The robust subgeneric and sectional relationships within <i>Allium</i> have long been not resolved. Based on 76 species of <i>Allium</i> (a total of 84 accessions), we developed a highly resolved plastome phylogenetic framework by integrating 18 newly sequenced species (20 accessions) in this study and assessed their subgeneric and sectional relationships, with special emphasis on the two subgenera <i>Anguinum</i> and <i>Rhizirideum</i>. We retrieved the three major evolutionary lines within <i>Allium</i> and found that the two subgenera <i>Anguinum</i> and <i>Rhizirideum</i> are monophyletic whereas others are highly polyphyletic (e.g., <i>Allium</i>, <i>Cepa</i>, <i>Polyprason</i>, and <i>Melanocrommyum</i>). Within the subgenus <i>Anguinum</i>, two strongly supported sublineages in East Asian and Eurasian-American were found. <i>Allium tricoccum</i> in North America belonged to the Eurasian clade. The distinct taxonomic status of <i>A. ulleungense</i> and its sister taxon were further determined. In subg. <i>Rhizirideum</i>, the Ulleung Island endemic <i>A. dumebuchum</i> shared its most recent common ancestor with the species from Mongolia and the narrow Korean endemic <i>A. minus</i>. Two Ulleung Island endemics were estimated to originate independently during the Pleistocene. In addition, a separate monotypic sectional treatment of the east Asian <i>A. macrostemon</i> (subg. <i>Allium</i>) and sister relationship between <i>A. condensatum</i> and <i>A. chinense</i> was suggested.
