Due to recent global warming, heat stress can simultaneously occur with cadmium (Cd) stress in regions suffering from metal pollution. In this study, we investigated the effects of heat, Cd and their combination on the growth and physiological characteristics of Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis plants were more susceptible to a combination of heat and Cd stress than to each stress applied individually, although the accumulation of Cd in shoots was comparable between plants subjected to Cd stress and the combined stress. Plants subjected to this stress combination showed a dramatic reduction in the accumulation of the photosynthetic reaction center proteins in photosystem II as well as a tendency toward enhanced lipid peroxidation, suggesting that the negative effects of a combination of heat and Cd stresses might be caused by oxidative damage accompanied by damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Interestingly, aos and lox3 mutants deficient in jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis showed attenuation of the negative effects caused by a combination of heat and Cd stresses on the growth and maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II. The roles of JA might be altered when heat stress is combined with Cd stress, despite its significance in the tolerance of plants to Cd stress when individually applied, which has been shown in previous studies.
