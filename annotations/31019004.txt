Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) reorganizes the endomembrane system of the infected cell to generate endoplasmic-reticulum-derived motile vesicles containing viral replication complexes. The membrane-associated viral protein 6K<sub>2</sub> plays a key role in the formation of these vesicles. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that this viral protein, a marker for viral replication complexes, localized in the extracellular space of infected <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves. Previously, we showed that viral RNA is associated with multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Here, using transmission electron microscopy, we observed the proliferation of MVBs during infection and their fusion with the plasma membrane that resulted in the release of their intraluminal vesicles in the extracellular space. Immunogold labeling with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes double-stranded RNA indicated that the released vesicles contained viral RNA. Focused ion beam-extreme high-resolution scanning electron microscopy was used to generate a three-dimensional image that showed extracellular vesicles in the cell wall. The presence of TuMV proteins in the extracellular space was confirmed by proteomic analysis of purified extracellular vesicles from <i>N</i> <i>benthamiana</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Host proteins involved in biotic defense and in interorganelle vesicular exchange were also detected. The association of extracellular vesicles with viral proteins and RNA emphasizes the implication of the plant extracellular space in viral infection.
