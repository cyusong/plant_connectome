['12913173', 'Tocopherols are lipophilic antioxidants synthesized exclusively by photosynthetic  organisms and collectively constitute vitamin E, an essential nutrient for both  humans and animals. Tocopherol cyclase (TC) catalyzes the conversion of various  phytyl quinol pathway intermediates to their corresponding tocopherols through  the formation of the chromanol ring. Herein, the molecular and biochemical  characterization of TCs from Arabidopsis (VTE1 [VITAMIN E 1]), Zea mays (SXD1  [Sucrose Export Deficient 1]) and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (slr1737) are  described. Mutations in the VTE1, SXD1, or slr1737 genes resulted in both  tocopherol deficiency and the accumulation of  2,3-dimethyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DMPBQ), a TC substrate. Recombinant SXD1  and VTE1 proteins are able to convert DMPBQ to gamma-tocopherol in vitro. In  addition, expression of maize SXD1 in a Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 slr1737  knockout mutant restored tocopherol synthesis, indicating that TC activity is  evolutionarily conserved between plants and cyanobacteria. Sequence analysis  identified a highly conserved 30-amino acid C-terminal domain in plant TCs that  is absent from cyanobacterial orthologs. vte1-2 causes a truncation within this  C-terminal domain, and the resulting mutant phenotype suggests that this domain  is necessary for TC activity in plants. The defective export of Suc in sxd1  suggests that in addition to presumed antioxidant activities, tocopherols or  tocopherol breakdown products also function as signal transduction molecules, or,  alternatively, the DMPBQ that accumulates in sxd1 disrupts signaling required for  efficient Suc export in maize.', '2003 Aug', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.024257', 'DellaPenna']
