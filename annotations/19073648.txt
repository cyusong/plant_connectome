['19073648', 'Pollen represents an important nitrogen sink in flowers to ensure pollen  viability. Since pollen cells are symplasmically isolated during maturation and  germination, membrane transporters are required for nitrogen import across the  pollen plasma membrane. This study describes the characterization of the ammonium  transporter AtAMT1;4, a so far uncharacterized member of the Arabidopsis AMT1  family, which is suggested to be involved in transporting ammonium into pollen.  The AtAMT1;4 gene encodes a functional ammonium transporter when heterologously  expressed in yeast or when overexpressed in Arabidopsis roots.  Concentration-dependent analysis of (15)N-labeled ammonium influx into roots of  AtAMT1;4-transformed plants allowed characterization of AtAMT1;4 as a  high-affinity transporter with a K(m) of 17 microM. RNA and protein gel blot  analysis showed expression of AtAMT1;4 in flowers, and promoter-gene fusions to  the green fluorescent protein (GFP) further defined its exclusive expression in  pollen grains and pollen tubes. The AtAMT1;4 protein appeared to be localized to  the plasma membrane as indicated by protein gel blot analysis of plasma  membrane-enriched membrane fractions and by visualization of GFP-tagged AtAMT1;4  protein in pollen grains and pollen tubes. However, no phenotype related to  pollen function could be observed in a transposon-tagged line, in which AtAMT1;4  expression is disrupted. These results suggest that AtAMT1;4 mediates ammonium  uptake across the plasma membrane of pollen to contribute to nitrogen nutrition  of pollen via ammonium uptake or retrieval.', '2009 Jan', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcn186', 'von']
