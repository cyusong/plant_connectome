['11113445', 'Here we report on the molecular identification, guard cell expression and  functional characterization of AtGORK, an Arabidopsis thaliana guard cell outward  rectifying K(+) channel. GORK represents a new member of the plant Shaker K(+)  channel superfamily. When heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes the gene  product of GORK mediated depolarization-activated K(+) currents. In agreement  with the delayed outward rectifier in intact guard cells and protoplasts thereof,  GORK is activated in a voltage- and potassium-dependent manner. Furthermore, the  single channel conductance and regulation of GORK in response to pH changes  resembles the biophysical properties of the guard cell delayed outward rectifier.  Thus GORK very likely represents the molecular entity for depolarization-induced  potassium release from guard cells.', '2000 Dec 8', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(00)02248-1', 'Hedrich']
