['20561259', "In plant chloroplasts, the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the large subunit of the  ribosome undergoes post-maturation fragmentation processing. This processing  consists of site-specific cleavage that generates gapped, discontinuous rRNA  molecules. However, the molecular mechanism underlying introduction of the gap  structure (the 'hidden break') is poorly understood. Here, we found that the DEAD  box protein RH39 plays a key role in introduction of the hidden break into the  23S rRNA in Arabidopsis chloroplasts. Genetic screening for an Arabidopsis plant  with a drastically reduced level of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate  carboxylase/oxygenase identified an RH39 mutant. The levels of other  chloroplast-encoded photosynthetic proteins were also severely reduced. The  reductions were not due to a failure of transcription, but rather inefficiency in  translation. RNA gel blotting revealed incomplete fragmentation of 23S rRNA in  chloroplasts during maturation. In vitro analysis with recombinant RH39 suggested  that the protein binds to the adjacent sequence upstream of the hidden break site  to exert its function. We propose a molecular mechanism for the RH39-mediated  fragmentation processing of 23S rRNA in chloroplasts.", '2010 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04276.x', 'Yokota']
