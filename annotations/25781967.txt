['25781967', 'Plant root hairs increase the root surface to enhance the uptake of sparingly  soluble and immobile nutrients, such as the essential nutrient phosphorus, from  the soil. Here, root hair traits and the response to scarce local phosphorus  concentration were studied in 166 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana using split  plates. Root hair density and length were correlated, but highly variable among  accessions. Surprisingly, the well-known increase in root hair density under low  phosphorus was mostly restricted to genotypes that had less and shorter root  hairs under P sufficient conditions. By contrast, several accessions with dense  and long root hairs even had lower hair density or shorter hairs in local scarce  phosphorus. Furthermore, accessions with whole-genome duplications developed more  dense but phosphorus-insensitive root hairs. The impact of genome duplication on  root hair density was confirmed by comparing tetraploid accessions with their  diploid ancestors. Genome-wide association mapping identified candidate genes  potentially involved in root hair responses tp scarce local phosphate. Knock-out  mutants in identified candidate genes (CYR1, At1g32360 and RLP48) were isolated  and differences in root hair traits in the mutants were confirmed. The large  diversity in root hair traits among accessions and the diverse response when  local phosphorus is scarce is a rich resource for further functional analyses.', '2015', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0120604', 'Ludewig']
