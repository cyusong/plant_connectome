['24603604', 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The putative FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEIN 4  (At-FLA4) locus of Arabidopsis thaliana has previously been shown to be required  for the normal growth of wild-type roots in response to moderately elevated  salinity. However, the genetic and physiological pathway that connects At-FLA4  and normal root growth remains to be elucidated. METHODS: The radial swelling  phenotype of At-fla4 was modulated with growth regulators and their inhibitors.  The relationship of At-FLA4 to abscisic acid (ABA) signalling was analysed by  probing marker gene expression and the observation of the At-fla4 phenotype in  combination with ABA signalling mutants. KEY RESULTS: Application of ABA  suppresses the non-redundant role of At-FLA4 in the salt response. At-FLA4  positively regulates the response to low ABA concentration in roots and is  required for the normal expression of ABA- and abiotic stress-induced genes. The  At-fla4 phenotype is enhanced in the At-abi4 background, while two genetic  suppressors of ABA-induced gene expression are required for salt oversensitivity  of At-fla4. Salt oversensitivity in At-fla4 is suppressed by the CYP707A  inhibitor abscinazole E2B, and salt oversensitivity in At-fla4 roots is  phenocopied by chemical inhibition of ABA biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The  predicted lipid-anchored glycoprotein At-FLA4 positively regulates cell wall  biosynthesis and root growth by modulating ABA signalling.', '2014 Oct', 'Ann Bot', '10.1093/aob/mcu010', 'Acet']
