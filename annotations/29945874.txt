['29945874', 'Microtubules are involved in plant development and adaptation to their  environment, but the sustaining molecular mechanisms remain elusive.  Microtubule-end-binding 1 (EB1) proteins participate in directional root growth  in Arabidopsis thaliana However, a connection to the underlying microtubule array  has not been established yet. We show here that EB1 proteins contribute to the  organization of cortical microtubules in growing epidermal plant cells, without  significant modulation of microtubule dynamics. Using super-resolution stimulated  emission depletion (STED) microscopy and an original quantification approach, we  also demonstrate a significant reduction of apparent microtubule bundling in  cytoplasmic-EB1-deficient plants, suggesting a function for EB1 in the  interaction between adjacent microtubules. Furthermore, we observed root growth  defects in EB1-deficient plants, which are not related to cell division  impairment. Altogether, our results support a role for EB1 proteins in root  development, in part by maintaining the organization of cortical  microtubules.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first  author of the paper.', '2018 Aug 2', 'Biol Open', '10.1242/bio.030510', 'ORCID:']
