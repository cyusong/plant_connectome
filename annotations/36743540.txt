Identification of soybean kernel damages is significant to prevent further disoperation. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has shown great potential in cereal kernel identification, but its low spatial resolution leads to external feature infidelity and limits the analysis accuracy. In this study, the fusion of HSI and RGB images and improved ShuffleNet were combined to develop an identification method for soybean kernel damages. First, the HSI-RGB fusion network (HRFN) was designed based on super-resolution and spectral modification modules to process the registered HSI and RGB image pairs and generate super-resolution HSI (SR-HSI) images. ShuffleNet improved with convolution optimization and cross-stage partial architecture (ShuffleNet_COCSP) was used to build classification models with the optimal image set of effective wavelengths (OISEW) of SR-HSI images obtained by support vector machine and ShuffleNet. High-quality fusion of HSI and RGB with the obvious spatial promotion and satisfactory spectral conservation was gained by HRFN. ShuffleNet_COCSP and OISEW obtained the optimal recognition performance of ACC<sub>p</sub>=98.36%, Params=0.805 M, and FLOPs=0.097 G, outperforming other classification methods and other types of images. Overall, the proposed method provides an accurate and reliable identification of soybean kernel damages and would be extended to analysis of other quality indicators of various crop kernels.
