When plants grow in close proximity basic resources such as light can become limiting. Under such conditions plants respond to anticipate and/or adapt to the light shortage, a process known as the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). Following genetic screening using a shade-responsive luciferase reporter line (PHYB:LUC), we identified DRACULA2 (DRA2), which encodes an Arabidopsis homolog of mammalian nucleoporin 98, a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). DRA2, together with other nucleoporins, participates positively in the control of the hypocotyl elongation response to plant proximity, a role that can be considered dependent on the nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules (i.e. is transport dependent). In addition, our results reveal a specific role for DRA2 in controlling shade-induced gene expression. We suggest that this novel regulatory role of DRA2 is transport independent and that it might rely on its dynamic localization within and outside of the NPC. These results provide mechanistic insights in to how SAS responses are rapidly established by light conditions. They also indicate that nucleoporins have an active role in plant signaling.
