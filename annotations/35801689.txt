Quinoa germplasm preserves useful and substantial genetic variation, yet it remains untapped due to a lack of implementation of modern breeding tools. We have integrated field and sequence data to characterize a large diversity panel of quinoa. Whole-genome sequencing of 310 accessions revealed 2.9 million polymorphic high confidence single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. Highland and Lowland quinoa were clustered into two main groups, with <i>F<sub>ST</sub></i> divergence of 0.36 and linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay of 6.5 and 49.8 kb, respectively. A genome-wide association study using multi-year phenotyping trials uncovered 600 SNPs stably associated with 17 traits. Two candidate genes are associated with thousand seed weight, and a resistance gene analog is associated with downy mildew resistance. We also identified pleiotropically acting loci for four agronomic traits important for adaptation. This work demonstrates the use of re-sequencing data of an orphan crop, which is partially domesticated to rapidly identify marker-trait association and provides the underpinning elements for genomics-enabled quinoa breeding.
