Roots are important organs of plants. Plants rely on roots for water, nutrients and organic salts. In the whole root system, lateral roots (LRs) account for a large proportion and are critical to the development of the plant. Many environmental factors affect LR development. Therefore, a systematic understanding of these factors can provide a theoretical basis for creating optimal growth conditions for plants. In this paper, the factors affecting LR development are systematically and comprehensively summarized, and the molecular mechanism and regulatory network of LR development are described. Changes in the external environment not only lead to hormone homeostasis in plants but also affect the composition and activity of rhizosphere microbial communities, which in turn affect plants' nitrogen and phosphorus uptake and growth dynamics. LR development is influenced by hormone levels and external environment. In particular, auxin and ABA coordinate with each other to maintain normal LR development. Of course, changes in the external environment are also important for root development, and they affect the intrinsic hormone levels of plants by affecting the accumulation and transport of hormones. For example, nitrogen, phosphorus, ROS, NO, water, drought, light and rhizosphere microorganisms affect LR development and plant tolerance in a variety of ways, including regulating hormone levels. This review summarizes the factors affecting LR development and the regulatory network and points out the direction for future research. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
