Due to the ability to tolerate extreme dehydration, desiccation-tolerant plants have been widely investigated to find potential approaches for improving water use efficiency or developing new crop varieties. The studies of desiccation-tolerant plants have identified sugar accumulation, specific protein synthesis, cell structure changes, and increased anti-oxidative reactions as part of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance. However, plants respond differently according to the severity of water loss, and the process of water loss affects desiccation tolerance. A detailed analysis within the dehydration process is important for understanding the process of desiccation tolerance. This review defines dehydration and desiccation, finds the boundary for the relative water content between dehydration and desiccation, compares the molecular responses to dehydration and desiccation, compares signaling differences between dehydration and desiccation, and finally summarizes the strategies launched in desiccation-tolerant plants for dehydration and desiccation, respectively. The roles of abscisic acid (ABA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in sensing and signaling during dehydration are discussed. We outline how this knowledge can be exploited to generate drought-tolerant crop plants.
