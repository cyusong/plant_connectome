R-loops are a common chromatin feature with essential functions in multiple cellular processes and diseases. However, little is known about the dynamic patterns of R-loops in a given organism. Here, using our recently developed genome-wide R-loop profiling method, we generated a comprehensive atlas quantifying the R-loop patterns of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in 53 samples during development and during responses to environmental stimuli. The R-loop patterns were fairly stable in plants at the vegetative stage and in response to different light spectra and other environmental stimuli. Notably, the R-loops showed turnover during the plant life cycle, with patterns switching between generations. Importantly, R-loop dynamics was not strongly associated with RNA abundance, indicating that the mechanisms regulating R-loop formation and RNA accumulation are independent. We also observed enrichment of R-loops in transcription factor binding regions, suggesting that R-loops could function as potential <i>cis</i>-transcriptional regulators. This study provides an overview of R-loop dynamics in Arabidopsis during development and stress responses, highlights the unique dynamics of R-loops in the flowering plant Arabidopsis, and lays the groundwork for elucidating the functions of R-loops.
