['26714275', "CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and  mediates a variety of developmental processes in Arabidopsis by targeting a  number of key regulators for ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we identify a  novel COP1 interacting protein, COP1 SUPPRESSOR 2 (CSU2). Loss of function  mutations in CSU2 suppress the constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype of cop1-6  in darkness. CSU2 directly interacts with COP1 via their coiled-coil domains and  is recruited by COP1 into nuclear speckles in living plant cells. Furthermore,  CSU2 inhibits COP1 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro, and represses COP1  mediated turnover of HY5 in cell-free extracts. We propose that in csu2 cop1-6  mutants, the lack of CSU2's repression of COP1 allows the low level of COP1 to  exhibit higher activity that is sufficient to prevent accumulation of HY5 in the  dark, thus restoring the etiolated phenotype. In addition, CSU2 is required for  primary root development under normal light growth condition.", '2015 Dec', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1005747', 'Deng']
