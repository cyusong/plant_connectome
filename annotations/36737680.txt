Zinc is one of the essential trace elements in plants. There are few studies on the phytohormone to rescue the toxicity of excessive zinc to plants. The aim of this research was to evaluate the alleviating effects of brassinosteroids (BR) and gibberellic acid (GA) on the toxicity of Medicago sativa L. (M. sativa) induced by excessive zinc. After zinc, BR and GA were applied to M. sativa seedlings for 7 weeks, their physiological and biochemical properties and gene expression patterns were evaluated. BR and GA significantly weakened the inhibition effect of zinc stress on growth and biomass of M. sativa. Under zinc stress, the zinc accumulation in M. sativa roots was over 5 times that in shoots. Application of BR and GA reduced zinc accumulation in roots. The content of lipid peroxides in M. sativa decreased and the activity of antioxidant enzymes increased under BR and GA treatments. In addition, BR and GA treatment down-regulated the transcription level of MsZIP1/3/5, the transporters of zinc uptake in root cells. And BR and GA up-regulated the expressions of zinc efflux, chelation, vacuolar storage and long-distance transport related genes: MsZIP7, MsHMA1, MsZIF1, MsMTP1, MsYSL1 and MsNAS1. Our findings further showed that BR and GA application to M. sativa under zinc stress can reduce zinc accumulation, promote the response of the antioxidant defense system, and actively regulate the mechanism of heavy metal detoxification. Notably, 100 nM BR performed slightly better than 100 nM GA in all aspects of the detoxification of M. sativa by excessive zinc.
