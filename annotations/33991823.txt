['33991823', 'AtJ3 (J3)-a member of the Arabidopsis cytosolic HSP40 family-harbors a C-terminal  CaaX motif for farnesylation, which is exclusively catalyzed by protein  farnesyltransferase (PFT). Previously, prolonged incubation at 37\u202f degrees C for 4 d was  found to be lethal to the heat-intolerant 5 (hit5) mutant lacking PFT and  transgenic j3 plants expressing a CaaX-abolishing J3(C417S) construct, indicating  that farnesylated J3 is essential for heat tolerance in plants. Given the role of  HSP40s as cochaperones of HSP70s, the thermal sensitivity of five individual  cytosolic HSP70 (HSP70-1 to HSP70-5) knockout mutants was tested in this study.  Only hsp70-4 was sensitive to the prolonged heat treatment like hit5 and j3. The  bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay revealed that HSP70-4  interacted with J3 and J3(C417S)in vivo at normal (23\u202f degrees C) and high (37\u202f degrees C)  temperatures. At 23\u202f degrees C, both HSP70-4-J3 and HSP70-4-J3(C417S) BiFC signals were  uniformly distributed across the cell. However, following treatment at 37\u202f degrees C,  HSP70-4-J3, but not HSP70-4-J3(C417S), BiFC signals were detected as discernable  foci. These heat-induced HSP70-4-J3 BiFC foci were localized in heat stress  granules (HSGs). In addition, hsp70-4 and J3(C417S) accumulated more insoluble  proteins than the wild type. Thus, farnesylated J3 dictates the chaperone  function of HSP70-4 in HSGs. Collectively, this study identified the first  HSP70/HSP40-type chaperone machinery playing a crucial role in protecting plants  against prolonged heat stress, and demonstrated the significance of protein  farnesylation in its protective function.', '2021 Jun', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2021.153430', 'Wu']
