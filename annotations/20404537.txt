The alternative oxidase (AOX) is the terminal oxidase that comprises the cyanide-resistant respiratory pathway in plant mitochondria. While the role of AOX in plant thermogenesis is well established, its role in the reproductive development of non-thermogenic species is not well understood. AOX genes can be separated into two groups based on sequence homology, AOX1 and AOX2. Reverse genetic experiments carried out primarily in Arabidopsis and tobacco have largely focussed on examining the role of AOX1-type genes in stress responses. We recently reported a systematic characterisation of the reproductive phenotypes of three AOX2 antisense lines of soybean. This addendum summarises the key evidence in our recent paper that points to a role for AOX in the development and function of both male and female gametophytes. Furthermore, we discuss the relative importance of AOX in the reproductive biology of plant species examined to date and highlight practical implications of our findings to crop improvement research.
