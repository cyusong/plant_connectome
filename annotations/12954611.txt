['12954611', 'Key components of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle in Arabidopsis cell organelles  are encoded by single organellar targeted isoforms that are dual localized in the  chloroplast stroma and the mitochondrion. We demonstrate the presence of the  ascorbate-glutathione cycle in purified Arabidopsis mitochondria using enzymatic  activity, proteomic and in vitro and in vivo subcellular targeting data that  identify the gene products responsible. In vitro experiments using a dual import  assay assessing mitochondrial and chloroplast imports simultaneously show dual  targeting of ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, and  glutathione reductase gene products to mitochondria and chloroplasts, while a  putative dehydroascorbate reductase protein is only imported into mitochondria.  In vivo subcellular localization using green fluorescent protein fusion proteins  show clear targeting of all gene products to mitochondria. Transcript levels show  these genes are induced by oxidative chemical stresses targeted to chloroplasts  and/or mitochondria and are elevated during photosynthetic operation in the  light. Together these data present a model of an integrated ascorbate-glutathione  antioxidant defense common to plastids and mitochondria that is linked at the  level of the genome in Arabidopsis.', '2003 Nov 21', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M307525200', 'Millar']
