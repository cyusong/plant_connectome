Although circumnutation occurs widely in higher plants, its mechanism is little understood. The idea that circumnutation is based on gravitropism has long been investigated, but the reported results have been controversial. We used dark-grown coleoptiles of rice (Oryza sativa L.) to re-investigate this issue. The following results supported the existence of a close relationship between gravitropism and circumnutation: (1) circumnutation disappears on a horizontal clinostat; (2) circumnutation is interrupted by a gravitropic response and re-initiated at a definable phase after gravitropic curvature; (3) circumnutation can be re-established by submergence and a brief gravitropic stimulation in the coleoptiles that have stopped nutating in response to red light; and (4) lazy mutants show no circumnutation. In spite of these results, however, there were cases in which gravitropism and circumnutation could be separated. Firstly, the non-circumnutating lazy coleoptile showed nearly a wild-type level of gravitropic responsiveness in its upper half, although this part was an active site of both gravitropism and circumnutation in wild-type coleoptiles. Secondly, coleoptiles could nutate without overshooting the vertical when developing phototropic curvature. It is concluded that gravitropism influences, but it is not directly involved in the process of circumnutation. It is further suggested that a gravity signal, shared with gravitropism, contributes to the maintenance of circumnutation.
