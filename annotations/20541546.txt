The lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway was proposed to compete with hydrolysis and be partly responsible for the metabolism of polyunsaturated N-acylethanolamines (PU-NAEs). Treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with lauroylethanolamide (NAE 12:0) resulted in elevated levels of PU-NAE species, and this was most pronounced in plants with reduced NAE hydrolase activity. Enzyme activity assays revealed that NAE 12:0 inhibited LOX-mediated oxidation of PU lipid substrates in a dose-dependent and competitive manner. NAE 12:0 was 10-20 times more potent an inhibitor of LOX activities than lauric acid (FFA 12:0). Furthermore, treatment of intact Arabidopsis seedlings with NAE 12:0 (but not FFA 12:0) substantially blocked the wound-induced formation of jasmonic acid (JA), suggesting that NAE 12:0 may be used in planta to manipulate oxylipin metabolism.
