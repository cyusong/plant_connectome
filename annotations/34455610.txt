Nepenthes ampullaria is a unique carnivorous tropical pitcher plant with the detritivorous capability of sequestering nutrients from leaf litter apart from being insectivorous. The changes in the protein composition and protease activity of its pitcher fluids during the early opening of pitchers (D0 and D3C) were investigated via a proteomics approach and a controlled protein depletion experiment (D3L). A total of 193 proteins were identified. Common proteins such as pathogenesis-related protein, proteases (Nep [EC:3.4.23.12], SCP [EC:3.4.16.-]), peroxidase [EC:1.11.1.7], GDSL esterase/lipase [EC:3.1.1.-], and purple acid phosphatase [EC:3.1.3.2] were found in high abundance in the D0 pitchers and were replenished in D3L samples. This reflects their importance for biological processes upon pitcher opening. Meanwhile, prey-inducible chitinases [EC:3.2.1.14] were found in D0 but not in D3C and D3L samples, which suggests their degradation in the absence of prey. Protease activity assays demonstrated the replenishment of proteases in D3L with similar levels of proteolytic activities to that of D3C samples. This supports a feedback mechanism and signaling in the molecular regulation of endogenous protein secretion, turnover, and activity in Nepenthes pitcher fluids. Furthermore, we also discovered several new enzymes (XTH [EC:2.4.1.207], PAE [EC:3.1.1.98]) with possible functions in cell wall degradation that could contribute to the detritivory habit of N. ampullaria.
