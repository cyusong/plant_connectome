['31451552', 'Potassium (K(+)) is a key monovalent cation necessary for multiple aspects of  cell growth and survival. In plants, this cation also plays a key role in the  control of stomatal movement. KAT1 and its homolog KAT2 are the main inward  rectifying channels present in guard cells, mediating K(+) influx into these  cells, resulting in stomatal opening. To gain further insight into the regulation  of these channels, we performed a split-ubiquitin protein-protein interaction  screen searching for KAT1 interactors in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We  characterized one of these candidates, BCL2-ASSOCIATED ATHANOGENE4 (BAG4), in  detail using biochemical and genetic approaches to confirm this interaction and  its effect on KAT1 activity. We show that BAG4 improves KAT1-mediated K(+)  transport in two heterologous systems and provide evidence that in plants, BAG4  interacts with KAT1 and favors the arrival of KAT1 at the plasma membrane.  Importantly, lines lacking or overexpressing the BAG4 gene show altered KAT1  plasma membrane accumulation and alterations in stomatal movement. Our data  allowed us to identify a KAT1 regulator and define a potential target for the  plant BAG family. The identification of physiologically relevant regulators of  K(+) channels will aid in the design of approaches that may impact drought  tolerance and pathogen susceptibility.', '2019 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00224', 'ORCID:']
