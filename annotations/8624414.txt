['8624414', 'Genes homologous to the auxin-inducible Nt103 glutathione S-transferase (GST)  gene of tobacco, were isolated from a genomic library of Arabidopsis thaliana. We  isolated a lambda clone containing an auxin-inducible gene, At103-1a, and part of  a constitutively expressed gene, At103-1b. The coding regions of the Arabidopsis  genes were highly homologous to each other and to the coding region of the  tobacco gene but distinct from the GST genes that have been isolated from  arabidopsis thusfar. Overexpression of a cDNA clone in Escherichia coli revealed  that the AT103-1A protein had GST activity.', '1996 Feb', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/BF00019016', 'Hooykaas']
