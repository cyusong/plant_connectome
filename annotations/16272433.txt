['16272433', 'Secondary walls in vessels and fibers of dicotyledonous plants are mainly  composed of cellulose, xylan, and lignin. Although genes involved in biosynthesis  of cellulose and lignin have been intensively studied, little is known about  genes participating in xylan synthesis. We found that Arabidopsis thaliana  fragile fiber8 (fra8) is defective in xylan synthesis. The fra8 mutation caused a  dramatic reduction in fiber wall thickness and a decrease in stem strength. FRA8  was found to encode a member of glycosyltransferase family 47 and exhibits high  sequence similarity to tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) pectin  glucuronyltransferase. FRA8 is expressed specifically in developing vessels and  fiber cells, and FRA8 is targeted to Golgi. Comparative analyses of cell wall  polysaccharide fractions from fra8 and wild-type stems showed that the xylan and  cellulose contents are drastically reduced in fra8, whereas xyloglucan and pectin  are elevated. Further structural analysis of cell walls revealed that although  wild-type xylans contain both glucuronic acid and 4-O-methylglucuronic acid  residues, xylans from fra8 retain only 4-O-methylglucuronic acid, indicating that  the fra8 mutation results in a specific defect in the addition of glucuronic acid  residues onto xylans. These findings suggest that FRA8 is a glucuronyltransferase  involved in the biosynthesis of glucuronoxylan during secondary wall formation.', '2005 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.035501', 'Ye']
