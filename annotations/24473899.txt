Arabidopsis ABI3 and maize VP1 are orthologous transcription factors that regulate seed maturation. ABI3 and VP1 have a C-terminal B3 DNA binding domain and a conserved N-terminal co-activator/co-repressor (COAR) domain consisting of A1, B1, B2 sub-domains. The COAR domain mediates abscisic acid signaling via a physical interaction with ABI5-related bZIP proteins. In order to delineate the COAR and B3 domain dependent functions of VP1, we created site directed mutations in the B3 domain that disrupted DNA binding activity and characterized gene regulation by the mutant proteins in transgenic abi3 mutant Arabidopsis plants. In seeds, COAR domain function of VP1 mutants that lacked B3 DNA binding activity was sufficient for complementation of the desiccation intolerant seed phenotype of abi3. Similarly in seedlings, the B3 domain was dispensable for most VP1 induced gene expression and ectopic developmental phenotypes, except for a small subset of the genes that showed B3 dependent regulation. Unexpectedly, over-expression of the DNA-binding deficient VP1-K519R mutant protein caused quantitative changes in floral organ size including elongation of pistils and shortened stamen filaments that resulted in a self-incompatible longistyly flower morphology, a key component of heterostyly type self-incompatibility.
