['27335350', 'Crop canopies create environments of highly fluctuating light intensities. In  such environments, photoprotective mechanisms and their relaxation kinetics have  been hypothesized to limit photosynthetic efficiency and therefore crop yield  potential. Here, we show that overexpression of the Arabidopsis thylakoid  K(+)/H(+) antiporter KEA3 accelerates the relaxation of photoprotective  energy-dependent quenching after transitions from high to low light in  Arabidopsis and tobacco. This, in turn, enhances PSII quantum efficiency in both  organisms, supporting that in wild-type plants, residual light energy quenching  following a high to low light transition represents a limitation to  photosynthetic efficiency in fluctuating light. This finding underscores the  potential of accelerating quenching relaxation as a building block for improving  photosynthetic efficiency in the field. Additionally, by overexpressing natural  KEA3 variants with modification to the C-terminus, we show that KEA3 activity is  regulated by a mechanism involving its lumen-localized C-terminus, which lowers  KEA3 activity in high light. This regulatory mechanism fine-tunes the balance  between photoprotective energy dissipation in high light and maximum quantum  yield in low light, likely to be critical for efficient photosynthesis in  fluctuating light conditions.', '2016 Jul', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcw085', 'Niyogi']
