Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plants and a key limiting factor of crop production. However, excessive application of N fertilizers and the low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) have brought in severe damage to the environment. Therefore, improving NUE is urgent and critical for the reductions of N fertilizer pollution and production cost. In the present study, we investigated the effects of N nutrition on the growth and yield of the two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars, conventional rice Huanghuazhan and indica hybrid rice Quanliangyou 681, which were grown at three levels of N fertilizer (including 135, 180 and 225 kg/hm<sup>2</sup>, labeled as N9, N12, N15, respectively). Then, a proteomic approach was employed in the roots of the two rice cultivars treated with N fertilizer at the level of N15. A total of 6728 proteins were identified, among which 6093 proteins were quantified, and 511 differentially expressed proteins were found in the two rice cultivars after N fertilizer treatment. These differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in ammonium assimilation, amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, signal transduction, energy production/regulation, material transport, and stress/defense response. Together, this study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of nitrogen fertilization in cereal crops.
