Photorespiration is a dynamic process that is intimately linked to photosynthetic carbon assimilation. There is a growing interest in understanding carbon assimilation during dynamic conditions, but the role of photorespiration under such conditions is unclear. In this review, we discuss recent work relevant to the function of photorespiration under dynamic conditions, with a special focus on light transients. This work reveals that photorespiration is a fundamental component of the light induction of assimilation where variable diffusive processes limit CO2 exchange with the atmosphere. Additionally, metabolic interactions between photorespiration and the C3 cycle may help balance fluxes under dynamic light conditions. We further discuss how the energy demands of photorespiration present special challenges to energy balancing during dynamic conditions. We finish the review with an overview of why regulation of photorespiration may be important under dynamic conditions to maintain appropriate fluxes through metabolic pathways related to photorespiration such as nitrogen and one-carbon metabolism.
