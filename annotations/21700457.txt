['21700457', 'The pattern of plant organ initiation at the shoot apical meristem (SAM), termed  phyllotaxis, displays regularities that have long intrigued botanists and  mathematicians alike. In the SAM, the central zone (CZ) contains a population of  stem cells that replenish the surrounding peripheral zone (PZ), where organs are  generated in regular patterns. These patterns differ between species and may  change in response to developmental or environmental cues [1]. Expression  analysis of auxin efflux facilitators of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) family combined  with modeling of auxin transport has indicated that organ initiation is  associated with intracellular polarization of PIN proteins and auxin accumulation  [2-10]. However, regulators that modulate PIN activity to determine phyllotactic  patterns have hitherto been unknown. Here we reveal that three redundantly acting  PLETHORA (PLT)-like AP2 domain transcription factors control shoot organ  positioning in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Loss of PLT3, PLT5, and PLT7  function leads to nonrandom, metastable changes in phyllotaxis. Phyllotactic  changes in plt3plt5plt7 mutants are largely attributable to misregulation of PIN1  and can be recapitulated by reducing PIN1 dosage, revealing that PLT proteins are  key regulators of PIN1 activity in control of phyllotaxis.', '2011 Jul 12', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2011.05.009', 'Scheres']
