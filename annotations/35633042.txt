Mutation of the sperm-specific phospholipase A and treatment of pollen with reactive oxygen species (ROS) reagents lead to the induction of maize haploids. ZmPOD65, a gene associated with sperm-specific ROS metabolism, also exhibits a haploidization effect.

Mutation of phospholipase A: !induces! maize haploids
ROS reagents: !induce! maize haploids
