Plant somatic embryogenesis (SE) is an in vitro biological process wherein bipolar structures are induced to form somatic cells and regenerate into whole plants. MicroRNA (miRNA) is an essential player in plant SE. However, the mechanism of microRNA408 (miR408) in SE remains elusive. Here, we used stable transgenic technology in longan (Dimocarpus longan) embryogenic calli to verify the mechanism by which miR408 promotes cell division and differentiation of longan early SE. dlo-miR408-3p regulated riboflavin biosynthesis by targeting nudix hydrolase 23 (DlNUDT23), a previously unidentified gene mediating N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification and influencing RNA homeostasis and cell cycle gene expression during longan early SE. We showed that DlMIR408 overexpression (DlMIR408-OE) promoted 21-nt miRNA biosynthesis. In DlMIR408-OE cell lines, dlo-miR408-3p targeted and downregulated DlNUDT23, promoted riboflavin biosynthesis, decreased flavin mononucleotide (FMN) accumulation, promoted m6A level, and influenced miRNA homeostasis. DNA replication, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism were also closely associated with riboflavin metabolism. In a riboflavin feeding assay, dlo-miR408-3p and pre-miR408 were upregulated and DlNUDT23 was downregulated, increasing the m6A level and cell division and differentiation in longan globular embryos. When riboflavin biosynthesis was inhibited, dlo-miR408-3p was downregulated and DlNUDT23 was upregulated, which decreased m6A modification and inhibited cell division but did not inhibit cell differentiation. FMN artificial demethylated m6A modification affected the homeostasis of precursor miRNA and miRNA. Our results revealed a mechanism underlying dlo-miR408-3p-activated riboflavin biosynthesis in which DlNUDT23 is targeted, m6A modification is dynamically mediated, and cell division is affected, promoting early SE in plants.
