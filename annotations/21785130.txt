The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) was first discovered based on its similarity to complex I in respiratory electron transport, and is involved in electron transport from photoproduced stromal reductants such as NADPH and ferredoxin to the intersystem plastoqunone pool. However, a recent study suggested that it is a ferredoxin-dependent plastoquinone reductase rather than an NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. Furthermore, recent advances in subunit analysis of NDH have revealed the presence of a novel hydrophilic subcomplex on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane, as well as an unexpected lumenal subcomplex. This review discusses these new studies on the structure of NDH, and proposes a unified nomenclature for newly discovered NDH subunits.

NDH: !involves! electron transport 
NDH: !is a! ferredoxin-dependent plastoquinone reductase 
NDH: !contains! hydrophilic subcomplex 
NDH: !contains! lumenal subcomplex
