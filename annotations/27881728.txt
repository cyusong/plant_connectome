A sensitive and dynamically responsive auxin signaling reporter based on the DII domain of the INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID28 (IAA28, DII) protein from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was modified for use in maize (Zea mays). The DII domain was fused to a yellow fluorescent protein and a nuclear localization sequence to simplify quantitative nuclear fluorescence signal. DII degradation dynamics provide an estimate of input signal into the auxin signaling pathway that is influenced by both auxin accumulation and F-box coreceptor concentration. In maize, the DII-based marker responded rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner to exogenous auxin via proteasome-mediated degradation. Low levels of DII-specific fluorescence corresponding to high endogenous auxin signaling occurred near vasculature tissue and the outer layer and glume primordia of spikelet pair meristems and floral meristems, respectively. In addition, high DII levels were observed in cells during telophase and early G1, suggesting that low auxin signaling at these stages may be important for cell cycle progression.
