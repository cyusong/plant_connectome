Brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate of maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) growth, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to determine how BRs regulate maize morphology and physiology during development. Treatment with the BRs promoted primary root the elongation and growth during germination, and the early development of lateral roots. BRs treatment during the middle growth stage increased the levels of various stress resistance factors, and enhanced resistance to lodging, likely by protecting the plant against stem rot and sheath rot. BRs had no significant effect on plant height during late growth, but it increased leaf angle and photosynthetic efficiency, as well as yield and quality traits. Our findings increase our understanding of the regulatory effects of BR on maize root growth and development and the mechanism by which BR improves disease resistance, which could further the potential for using BR to improve maize yield.
