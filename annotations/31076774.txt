The seed oil quality of Brassica oilseed species has been improved in the last few decades, using conventional breeding approaches. Modern biotechnology has enabled the significant development of new seed lipid traits in many oil crops. Alternation of seed lipid component with gene knockout by RNAi gene silencing, artificial microRNA or gene editing within the crop is relative straightforward. Introducing a new pathway from an exogenous source via biotechnology enables the creation of a new trait, where the biosynthetic pathway for such a new trait is not available in the host crop. This review updates the recent development of new seed lipid traits in six major Brassica species and highlights the capability of biotechnology to improve the composition of important fatty acids for both industrial and nutritional purposes.
