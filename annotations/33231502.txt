Many plant-encoded E3 ligases are known to be involved in plant defense. Here, we report a novel role of E3 ligase SALT- AND DROUGHT-INDUCED RING FINGER1 (SDIR1) in plant immunity. Even though SDIR1 is reasonably well-characterized, its role in biotic stress response is not known. The silencing of <i>SDIR1</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> reduced the multiplication of the virulent bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tabaci</i>. The <i>Arabidopsis sdir1</i> mutant is resistant to virulent pathogens, whereas <i>SDIR1</i> overexpression lines are susceptible to both host and nonhost hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogens. However, <i>sdir1</i> mutant and <i>SDIR1</i> overexpression lines showed hypersusceptibility and resistance, respectively, against the necrotrophic pathogen <i>Erwinia carotovora</i>. The mutant of SDIR1 target protein, i.e., SDIR-interacting protein 1 (SDIR1P1), also showed resistance to host and nonhost pathogens. In <i>SDIR1</i> overexpression plants, transcripts of <i>NAC</i> transcription factors were less accumulated and the levels of jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid were increased. In the <i>sdir1</i> mutant, JA signaling genes <i>JAZ7</i> and <i>JAZ8</i> were downregulated. These data suggest that SDIR1 is a susceptibility factor and its activation or overexpression enhances disease caused by <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Our results show a novel role of SDIR1 in modulating plant defense gene expression and plant immunity.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
