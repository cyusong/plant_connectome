Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation to fluctuating availability of nutrients in soil. Such mechanisms are of importance for plants to maintain homeostasis of nutrient elements for their development and growth. The molecular mechanisms controlling the homeostasis of nutrient elements at the genetic level have been gradually revealed, including the identification of regulatory factors and transporters responding to nutrient stresses. Recent studies have suggested that such responses are controlled not only by genetic regulation but also by epigenetic regulation. In this review, we present recent studies on the involvement of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA-mediated gene silencing in the regulation of sulfur homeostasis and the response to sulfur deficiency. We also discuss the potential effect of sulfur-containing metabolites such as S-adenosylmethionine on the maintenance of DNA and histone methylation.

DNA methylation: !regulates! sulfur homeostasis
histone modifications: !regulate! sulfur homeostasis
non-coding RNA: !silences! gene expression
S-adenosylmethionine: !maintains! DNA and histone methylation
