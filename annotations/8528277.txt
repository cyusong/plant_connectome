['8528277', 'This paper reports the characterization of novel mutations within the Arabidopsis  thaliana HY4 gene, which has previously been shown to encode a protein (CRY1)  with characteristics of a blue-light photoreceptor. Several point mutations were  identified within the amino-terminal domain of CRY1--this region of CRY1 has high  homology to photolyase and is likely to be involved in blue-light-mediated  electron transfer. Mutations were found within the region of homology to the  known chromophore binding domains of photolyase. Point mutations within the 200  amino acid carboxy-terminal extension distinguishing CRY1 from photolyase,  likewise disrupt function of the protein. CRY1 was originally defined as the  photoreceptor responsible for blue-light-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl  elongation and we now report that anthocyanin accumulation in germinating  seedlings is an additional phenotype under the control of this  photoreceptor--this is shown to be mediated in part by modulation of mRNA levels  of chalcone synthase, one of the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes. The effect of  the novel mutations on both inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and anthocyanin  biosynthesis have been evaluated, and it is demonstrated that mutations with less  severe effects on hypocotyl elongation show a similarly reduced effect on  anthocyanin biosynthesis. These results are consistent with the cryptochrome  photoreceptor mediating multiple regulatory pathways by the same primary mode of  action.', '1995 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1995.08050653.x', 'Cashmore']
