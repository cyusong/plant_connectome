['8329681', 'To resist terrestrial UV radiation, plants employ DNA-damage-repair/toleration  (DRT) activities, as well as shielding mechanisms. Little is known about the  structure and regulation of plant DRT genes. We isolated DRT cDNAs from  Arabidopsis thaliana, by selecting for complementation of Escherichia coli  mutants lacking all bacterial defenses against UV-light damage to DNA. These  mutants are phenotypically deficient in recombinational and mutagenic toleration  (RecA-), excision repair (Uvr-) and photoreactivation (Phr-). Among 840 survivors  of heavily UV-irradiated (10(-7) survival) mutants harboring plasmids derived  from an Arabidopsis cDNA library in the vector lambda YES, we identified four  unique plant cDNAs, designated DRT100, DRT101, DRT102, and DRT103. Drt101 and  Drt102 activity were specific for UV-light damage, and complemented both UvrB-  and UvrC- phenotypes in the dark. Apparent Uvr- correction efficiencies were 1 to  40% for Drt101, and 0.2 to 15% for Drt102, depending on the UV fluence. Drt101  and Drt102 showed no extensive amino-acid homology with any known DNA-repair  proteins. Drt100 appeared to correct RecA-, rather than Uvr-, phenotypes.  Although the light dependence of Drt103 activity was consistent with its  identification as a photoreactivating enzyme, its predicted amino-acid sequence  did not resemble known photolyase sequences. The N-terminal coding sequence of  Drt101 suggests that it is targeted to chloroplasts, as reported for Drt100.  These cDNAs afforded only modest increases in survival during the original  selection procedure. The fact that they were readily isolated nevertheless  suggests that selections may be made powerful enough to overcome barriers to  expression and function in bacteria, at least for cDNAs of reasonable abundance.', '1993 Jun', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/BF00015972', 'Schaefer']
