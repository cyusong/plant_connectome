The lipid bilayer of biological membranes has a complex composition, including high chemical heterogeneity, the presence of nanodomains of specific lipids, and asymmetry with respect to lipid composition between the two membrane leaflets. In membrane trafficking, membrane vesicles constantly bud off from one membrane compartment and fuse with another, and both budding and fusion events have been proposed to require membrane lipid asymmetry. One mechanism for generating asymmetry in lipid bilayers involves the action of the P4 ATPase family of lipid flippases; these are biological pumps that use ATP as an energy source to flip lipids from one leaflet to the other. The model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) contains 12 P4 ATPases (AMINOPHOSPHOLIPID ATPASE1-12; ALA1-12), many of which are functionally redundant. Studies of P4 ATPase mutants have confirmed the essential physiological functions of these pumps and pleiotropic mutant phenotypes have been observed, as expected when genes required for basal cellular functions are disrupted. For instance, phenotypes associated with ala3 (dwarfism, pollen defects, sensitivity to pathogens and cold, and reduced polar cell growth) can be related to membrane trafficking problems. P5 ATPases are evolutionarily related to P4 ATPases, and may be the counterpart of P4 ATPases in the endoplasmic reticulum. The absence of P4 and P5 ATPases from prokaryotes and their ubiquitous presence in eukaryotes make these biological pumps a defining feature of eukaryotic cells. Here, we review recent advances in the field of plant P4 and P5 ATPases.
