To identify genes involved in Arabidopsis thaliana petal and stamen organogenesis, we used a gene trap approach to examine the patterns of reporter expression at each stage of flower development of 1765 gene trap lines. In 80 lines, the reporter gene showed petal- and/or stamen-specific expression or lack of expression, or expression in distinct patterns within the petals and/or the stamens, including distinct suborgan domains of expression, such as tissue-specific lines marking epidermis and vasculature, as well as lines demarcating the proximodistal or abaxial/adaxial axes of the organs. Interestingly, reporter gene expression was typically restricted along the proximodistal axis of petals and stamens, indicating the importance of this developmental axis in patterning of gene expression domains in these organs. We identified novel domains of gene expression along the axis marking the midregion of the petals and apical and basal parts of the anthers. Most of the genes tagged in these 80 lines were identified, and their possible functions in petal and/or stamen differentiation are discussed. We also scored the floral phenotypes of the 1765 gene trap lines and recovered two mutants affecting previously uncharacterized genes. In addition to revealing common domains of gene expression, the gene trap lines reported here provide both useful markers and valuable starting points for reverse genetic analyses of the differentiation pathways in petal and stamen development.
