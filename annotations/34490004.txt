Rice disease has serious negative effects on crop yield, and the correct diagnosis of rice diseases is the key to avoid these effects. However, the existing disease diagnosis methods for rice are neither accurate nor efficient, and special equipment is often required. In this study, an automatic diagnosis method was developed and implemented in a smartphone app. The method was developed using deep learning based on a large dataset that contained 33,026 images of six types of rice diseases: leaf blast, false smut, neck blast, sheath blight, bacterial stripe disease, and brown spot. The core of the method was the Ensemble Model in which submodels were integrated. Finally, the Ensemble Model was validated using a separate set of images. Results showed that the three best submodels were DenseNet-121, SE-ResNet-50, and ResNeSt-50, in terms of several attributes, such as, learning rate, precision, recall, and disease recognition accuracy. Therefore, these three submodels were selected and integrated in the Ensemble Model. The Ensemble Model minimized confusion among the different types of disease, reducing misdiagnosis of the disease. Using the Ensemble Model to diagnose six types of rice diseases, an overall accuracy of 91% was achieved, which is considered to be reasonably good, considering the appearance similarities in some types of rice disease. The smartphone app allowed the client to use the Ensemble Model on the web server through a network, which was convenient and efficient for the field diagnosis of rice leaf blast, false smut, neck blast, sheath blight, bacterial stripe disease, and brown spot.
