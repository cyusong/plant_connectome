['15743449', "Actin-related proteins (ARPs) share moderate sequence homology and basal  structure with conventional actins and are found in all eukaryotes. While the  functions of most of the divergent ARPs are not clear, several of them are  localized to the nucleus and have been identified as components of various  chromatin-modifying complexes. Using an antibody to Arabidopsis AtARP4, we found  this conserved homolog of human BAF53 and yeast Arp4 is concentrated in the  nucleoplasm of Arabidopsis, Brassica, and tobacco cells. To gain further insight  into the role of ARP4, we have examined Arabidopsis plants that are defective in  AtARP4 expression. Phenotypic analysis of the arp4-1 mutant allele, which has a  T-DNA insertion in the promoter region and a moderate reduction in the level of  AtARP4 protein expression, revealed partial sterility due to defects in anther  development. Targeting the distinct, 3' UTR of AtARP4 transcripts with RNA  interference caused a drastic reduction in the level of AtARP4 protein expression  in several independent transgenic lines, and resulted in strong pleiotropic  phenotypes such as altered organization of plant organs, early flowering, delayed  flower senescence and high levels of sterility. Western blot analysis and  immunolabeling demonstrated a clear correlation between reductions in the level  of AtARP4 expression and severity of the phenotypes. Based on our results and  data on the orthologs of AtARP4 in yeast and other organisms, we suggest that  AtARP4 is likely to exert its effects on plant development through the modulation  of chromatin structure and subsequent changes in gene regulation.", '2005 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02345.x', 'Meagher']
