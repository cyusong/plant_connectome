Symbiotic nitrogen fixation, which is carried out by the legume-rhizobia partnership, is a major source of nitrogen acquisition in natural ecosystems and in agriculture. The benefits to the plant gained through the rhizobial-legume symbiosis can be further enhanced by associations of the legume with arbuscular mycorrhiza. The progressive engagement of the legume host with the rhizobial bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi requires an extensive exchange of signalling molecules. These signals alter the transcriptional profiles of the partners, guiding and enabling extensive microbial and fungal proliferation in the roots. Such interactions and associations are greatly influenced by environmental stresses, which also severely limit the productivity of legume crops. Part II of the Special Issue on Legumes provides new insights into the mechanisms that underpin sustainable symbiotic partnerships, as well as the effects of abiotic stresses, such as drought, waterlogging, and salinity on legume biology. The requirement for germplasm and new breeding methods is discussed as well as the future of legume production in the face of climate change.
