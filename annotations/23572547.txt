['23572547', 'Female gametogenesis in most flowering plants depends on the predetermined  selection of a single meiotically derived cell, as the three other megaspores die  without further division or differentiation. Although in Arabidopsis thaliana the  formation of the functional megaspore (FM) is crucial for the establishment of  the gametophytic generation, the mechanisms that determine the specification and  fate of haploid cells remain unknown. Here, we show that the classical  arabinogalactan protein 18 (AGP18) exerts an active regulation over the selection  and survival of megaspores in Arabidopsis. During meiosis, AGP18 is expressed in  integumentary cells located in the abaxial region of the ovule. Overexpression of  AGP18 results in the abnormal maintenance of surviving megaspores that can  acquire a FM identity but is not sufficient to induce FM differentiation before  meiosis, indicating that AGP18 positively promotes the selection of viable  megaspores. We also show that all four meiotically derived cells in the ovule of  Arabidopsis are competent to differentiate into a gametic precursor and that the  function of AGP18 is important for their selection and viability. Our results  suggest an evolutionary role for arabinogalactan proteins in the acquisition of  monospory and the developmental plasticity that is intrinsic to sexual  reproduction in flowering plants.', '2013 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.106237', 'Vielle-Calzada']
