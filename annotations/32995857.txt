Lesion mimic mutants constitute a valuable genetic resource for unraveling the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms governing the programmed cell death and defense responses of plants. Here, we identified a lesion mimic mutant, spl-D, from T-DNA insertion rice lines. The mutant exhibited higher accumulation of H2O2, spontaneous cell death, decreased chlorophyll content, up-regulation of defense-related genes, and enhanced disease resistance. The causative gene, OsGRDP1, encodes a cytosol- and membrane-associated glycine-rich domain protein. OsGRDP1 was expressed constitutively in all of the organs of the wild-type plant, but was up-regulated throughout plant development in the spl-D mutant. Both the overexpression and knockdown (RNAi) of OsGRDP1 resulted in the lesion mimic phenotype. Moreover, the intact-protein level of OsGRDP1 was reduced in the spotted leaves from both overexpression and RNAi plants, suggesting that the disruption of intact OsGRDP1 is responsible for lesion formation. OsGRDP1 interacted with an aspartic proteinase, OsAP25. In the spl-D and overexpression plants, proteinase activity was elevated, and lesion formation was partially suppressed by an aspartic proteinase inhibitor. Taken together, our results reveal that OsGRDP1 is a critical feedback regulator, thus contributing to the elucidation of the mechanism underlying cell death and disease resistance.
