Peroxisomes are highly dynamic organelles involved in various metabolic pathways. The division of peroxisomes is regulated by factors such as the PEROXIN11 (PEX11) proteins that promote peroxisome elongation and the dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) and FISSION1 (FIS1) proteins that function together to mediate organelle fission. In Arabidopsis thaliana, DRP3A/DRP3B and FIS1A (BIGYIN)/FIS1B are two pairs of homologous proteins known to function in both peroxisomal and mitochondrial division. Here, we report that DRP5B, a DRP distantly related to the DRP3s and originally identified as a chloroplast division protein, also contributes to peroxisome division. DRP5B localizes to both peroxisomes and chloroplasts. Mutations in the DRP5B gene lead to peroxisome division defects and compromised peroxisome functions. Using coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we further demonstrate that DRP5B can interact or form a complex with itself and with DRP3A, DRP3B, FIS1A, and most of the Arabidopsis PEX11 isoforms. Our data suggest that, in contrast with DRP3A and DRP3B, whose orthologs exist across plant, fungal, and animal kingdoms, DRP5B is a plant/algal invention to facilitate the division of their organelles (i.e., chloroplasts and peroxisomes). In addition, our results support the notion that proteins involved in the early (elongation) and late (fission) stages of peroxisome division may act cooperatively.
