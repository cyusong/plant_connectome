Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in various cellular processes in plants. Among those, resistance to abiotic stress, defence mechanisms and cell expansion have been intensively studied during the last years. We recently demonstrated that ROS, in concert with auxin, have a role in cell cycle activation of differentiated leaf cells.1 In this addendum we provide further evidence to show that oxidative stress/ROS accelerate auxin-mediated cell cycle entry (G(0)-to-G(1)) and may have a positive effect on the plant cell cycle machinery. A generalized model for concentration-dependent synergistic effect of auxin and ROS on differentiated plant cells is also shown.
