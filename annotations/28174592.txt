['28174592', 'As an ideal model for studying ethylene effects on cell elongation, Arabidopsis  hypocotyl growth is widely used due to the unique characteristic that ethylene  stimulates hypocotyl elongation in the light but inhibits it in the dark.  Although the contrasting effect of ethylene on hypocotyl growth has long been  known, the molecular basis of this effect has only gradually been identified in  recent years. In the light, ethylene promotes the expression of PHYTOCHROME  INTERACTING FACTOR 3 (PIF3) and the degradation of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5)  protein, thus stimulating hypocotyl growth. In the dark, ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR  1 (ERF1) and WAVE-DAMPENED 5 (WDL5) induced by ethylene are responsible for its  inhibitory effect on hypocotyl elongation. Moreover, CONSTITUTIVE  PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and PHYTOCHROME B (phyB) mediate the light-suppressed  ethylene response in different ways. Here, we review several pivotal advances  associated with ethylene-regulated hypocotyl elongation, focusing on the  integration of ethylene and light signaling during seedling emergence from the  soil.', '2017', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2017.00057', 'Huang']
