The red color is an attractive trait of fruit and determines its market acceptance. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an eco-friendly plant growth regulator, has played a universal role in plant secondary metabolism regulation, particularly in flavonoid biosynthesis. It has been widely reported that ALA can up-regulate expression levels of several structural genes related to flavonoid metabolism and anthocyanin accumulation. However, the molecular mechanisms behind ALA-induced expression of these genes are complicated and still far from being completely understood. In this study, transcriptome analysis identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with ALA-induced anthocyanin accumulation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the flavonoid biosynthesis (ko00941) pathway was significantly enhanced in the ALA-treated apple calli at 24, 48, and 72 h after the treatment. Expression pattern revealed that ALA up-regulated the expression of the structural genes related to not only anthocyanin biosynthesis (<i>MdCHS</i>, <i>MdCHI</i>, <i>MdF3'H</i>, <i>MdDFR</i>, <i>MdANS</i>, and <i>MdUFGT</i>) but also anthocyanin transport (<i>MdGST</i> and <i>MdMATE</i>). Two R2R3-MYB transcription factors (MdMYB10 and MdMYB9), which are the known positive regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis, were significantly induced by ALA. Gene overexpression and RNA interference assays demonstrated that <i>MdMYB10</i> and <i>MdMYB9</i> were involved in ALA-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis. Moreover, MdMYB10 and MdMYB9 might positively regulate the transcription of <i>MdMATE8</i> by binding to the promoter region. These results indicate that <i>MdMYB10</i> and <i>MdMYB9</i> modulated structural gene expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis and transport in response to ALA-mediated apple calli coloration at the transcript level. We herein provide new details regarding transcriptional regulation of ALA-induced color development.
