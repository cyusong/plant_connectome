Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) is a fast-growing species with uneven growth and lignification from lower to upper segments within one internode. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in post-transcriptional regulation in plants. However, how miRNAs regulate fast growth in bamboo internodes is poorly understood. In this study, one moso bamboo internode was divided during early rapid growth into four segments called F4 (bottom) to F1 (upper) and these were then analysed for transcriptomes, miRNAs and degradomes. The F4 segment had a higher number of actively dividing cells as well as a higher content of auxin (IAA), cytokinin (CK) and gibberellin (GA) compared with the F1 segment. RNA-seq analysis showed DNA replication and cell division-associated genes highly expressed in F4 rather than in F1. In total, 63 miRNAs (DEMs) were identified as differentially expressed between F4 and F1. The degradome and the transcriptome indicated that many downstream transcription factors and hormonal responses genes were modulated by DEMs. Several miR-target interactions were further validated by tobacco co-infiltration. Our findings give new insights into miRNA-mediated regulatory pathways in bamboo, and will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing rapid growth.
