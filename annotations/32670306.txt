Low phosphate (Pi) availability limits crop growth and yield in acid soils. Although root-associated acid phosphatases (APases) play an important role in extracellular organic phosphorus (P) utilization, they remain poorly studied in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), an important legume crop. In this study, dynamic changes in intracellular (leaf and root) and root-associated APase activities were investigated under both Pi-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions. Moreover, genome-wide identification of members of the <i>purple acid phosphatase</i> (<i>PAP</i>) family and their expression patterns in response to Pi starvation were analyzed in soybean. The functions of both <i>GmPAP7a</i> and <i>GmPAP7b</i>, whose expression is up regulated by Pi starvation, were subsequently characterized. Phosphate starvation resulted in significant increases in intracellular APase activities in the leaves after 4 days, and in root intracellular and associated APase activities after 1 day, but constant increases were observed only for root intracellular and associated APase activities during day 5-16 of P deficiency in soybean. Moreover, a total of 38 <i>GmPAP</i> members were identified in the soybean genome. The transcripts of 19 <i>GmPAP</i> members in the leaves and 17 in the roots were upregulated at 16 days of P deficiency despite the lack of a response for any <i>GmPAP</i> members to Pi starvation at 2 days. Pi starvation upregulated <i>GmPAP7a</i> and <i>GmPAP7b</i>, and they were subsequently selected for further analysis. Both GmPAP7a and GmPAP7b exhibited relatively high activities against adenosine triphosphate (ATP) <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, overexpressing <i>GmPAP7a</i> and <i>GmPAP7b</i> in soybean hairy roots significantly increased root-associated APase activities and thus facilitated extracellular ATP utilization. Taken together, these results suggest that GmPAP7a and GmPAP7b might contribute to root-associated APase activities, thus having a function in extracellular ATP utilization in soybean.
