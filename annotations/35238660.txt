SignificanceTwo billion people across the planet suffer from nutrient deficiencies. Dietary diversification is key to solving this problem, yet many food and nutrition security policies, especially in low- and middle-income countries, still focus on increasing agricultural production and access to sufficient calories as the main solution. But calories are not all equal. Here, we show how deforestation in Tanzania caused a reduction in fruit and vegetable consumption (of 14 g per person per day) and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. Using a combination of regression and weighting analyses to generate quasi-experimental quantitative estimates of the impacts of deforestation on people's food intake, our study establishes a causal link between deforestation and people's dietary quality.

Deforestation: !reduces! Fruit and vegetable consumption 
Fruit and vegetable consumption: !impacts! Vitamin A adequacy of diets
