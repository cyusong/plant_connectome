Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived compartments are found in many plant species. Although it has been assumed that aggregation induces formation of the ER-derived compartments in plant seed cells, the effect of aggregation on the trafficking from the ER to the Golgi has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we used an aggregated type of red fluorescent protein (DsRED) to investigate the effect of aggregation on sorting in seed cells. DsRED fused to the Golgi sorting determinant was found mainly in large globular structures derived from the ER where ER-resident proteins were excluded. These results indicate that aggregation of the Golgi protein blocks transport from the ER to the Golgi.
