['17114349', 'In plants, the chromatin-associated high mobility group (HMG) proteins occur in  two subfamilies termed HMGA and HMGB. The HMGA proteins are characterized by the  presence of four AT-hook DNA binding motifs, and the HMGB proteins contain an HMG  box DNA binding domain. As architectural factors, the HMG proteins appear to be  involved in the regulation of transcription and other DNA-dependent processes. We  have examined the subcellular localization of Arabidopsis thaliana HMGA, HMGB1,  and HMGB5, revealing that they localize to the cell nucleus. They display a  speckled distribution pattern throughout the chromatin of interphase nuclei,  whereas none of the proteins associate with condensed mitotic chromosomes. HMGA  is targeted to the nucleus by a monopartite nuclear localization signal, while  efficient nuclear accumulation of HMGB1/5 requires large portions of the basic  N-terminal part of the proteins. The acidic C-terminal domain interferes with  nucleolar targeting of HMGB1. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  experiments revealed that HMGA and HMGB proteins are extremely dynamic in the  nucleus, indicating that they bind chromatin only transiently before moving on to  the next site, thereby continuously scanning the genome for targets. By contrast,  the majority of histone H2B is basically immobile within the nucleus, while  linker histone H1.2 is relatively mobile.', '2006 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.047274', 'Grasser']
