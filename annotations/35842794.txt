The INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) transcription factors mediate various aspects of plant growth and development. We previously reported that an Arabidopsis IDD subfamily regulates spatial auxin accumulation, and thus organ morphogenesis and gravitropic responses. However, its functions in stress responses are not well defined. Here, we use a combination of physiological, biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches to provide evidence that the IDD14 cooperates with basic leucine zipper-type binding factors/ABA-responsive element (ABRE)-binding proteins (ABRE-binding factors (ABFs)/AREBs) in ABA-mediated drought tolerance. idd14-1D, a gain-of-function mutant of IDD14, exhibits decreased leaf water loss and improved drought tolerance, whereas inactivation of IDD14 in idd14-1 results in increased transpiration and reduced drought tolerance. Altered IDD14 expression affects ABA sensitivity and ABA-mediated stomatal closure. IDD14 can physically interact with ABF1-4 and subsequently promote their transcriptional activities. Moreover, ectopic expression and mutation of ABFs could, respectively, suppress and enhance plant sensitivity to drought stress in the idd14-1 mutant. Our results demonstrate that IDD14 forms a functional complex with ABFs and positively regulates drought-stress responses, thus revealing a previously unidentified role of IDD14 in ABA signaling and drought responses.
