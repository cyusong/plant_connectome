GSTZs [Zeta class GSTs (glutathione transferases)] are multifunctional enzymes that belong to a highly conserved subfamily of soluble GSTs found in species ranging from fungi and plants to animals. GSTZs are known to function as MAAIs [MAA (maleylacetoacetate) isomerases], which play a role in tyrosine catabolism by catalysing the isomerization of MAA to FAA (fumarylacetoacetate). As tyrosine metabolism in plants differs from animals, the significance of GSTZ/MAAI is unclear. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), a major QTL (quantitative trait locus) for seedling cold tolerance has been fine mapped to a region containing the genes OsGSTZ1 and OsGSTZ2. Sequencing of tolerant (ssp. japonica cv. M-202) and sensitive (ssp. indica cv. IR50) cultivars revealed two SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in OsGSTZ2 that result in amino acid differences (I99V and N184I). Recombinant OsGSTZ2 containing the Val99 residue found in IR50 had significantly reduced activity on MAA and DCA (dichloroacetic acid), but the Ile184 residue had no effect. The distribution of the SNP (c.295A>G) among various rice accessions indicates a significant association with chilling sensitivity in rice seedlings. The results of the present study show that naturally occurring OsGSTZ2 isoforms differ in their enzymatic properties, which may contribute to the differential response to chilling stress generally exhibited by the two major rice subspecies.
