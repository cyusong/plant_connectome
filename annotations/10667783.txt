['10667783', "Photosynthetic light harvesting in plants is regulated in response to changes in  incident light intensity. Absorption of light that exceeds a plant's capacity for  fixation of CO2 results in thermal dissipation of excitation energy in the  pigment antenna of photosystem II by a poorly understood mechanism. This  regulatory process, termed nonphotochemical quenching, maintains the balance  between dissipation and utilization of light energy to minimize generation of  oxidizing molecules, thereby protecting the plant against photo-oxidative damage.  To identify specific proteins that are involved in nonphotochemical quenching, we  have isolated mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana that cannot dissipate excess  absorbed light energy. Here we show that the gene encoding PsbS, an intrinsic  chlorophyll-binding protein of photosystem II, is necessary for nonphotochemical  quenching but not for efficient light harvesting and photosynthesis. These  results indicate that PsbS may be the site for nonphotochemical quenching, a  finding that has implications for the functional evolution of pigment-binding  proteins.", '2000 Jan 27', 'Nature', '10.1038/35000131', 'Niyogi']
