['19633233', 'Purple acid phosphatase (PAP) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters  and anhydrides to release phosphate within an acidic pH range. Among the 29  PAP-like proteins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), AtPAP15 (At3g07130)  displays a greater degree of amino acid identity with soybean (Glycine max;  GmPHY) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) PAP (NtPAP) with phytase activity than the  other AtPAPs. In this study, transgenic Arabidopsis that expressed an AtPAP15  promoterbeta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion protein showed that AtPAP15 expression  was developmentally and temporally regulated, with strong GUS staining at the  early stages of seedling growth and pollen germination. The expression was also  organ/tissue specific, with strongest GUS staining in the vasculature, pollen  grains, and roots. The recombinant AtPAP purified from transgenic tobacco  exhibited broad substrate specificity with moderate phytase activity. AtPAP15  T-DNA insertion lines exhibited a lower phytase and phosphatase activity in  seedling and germinating pollen and lower pollen germination rate compared with  the wild type and their complementation lines. Therefore, AtPAP15 likely  mobilizes phosphorus reserves in plants, particularly during seed and pollen  germination. Since AtPAP15 is not expressed in the root hair or in the epidermal  cells, it is unlikely to play any role in external phosphorus assimilation.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.143180', 'Lim']
