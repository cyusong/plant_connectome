['22837651', 'Arabidopsis thaliana seeds without functional SEED MATURATION PROTEIN1 (SMP1), a  boiling soluble protein predicted to be of intrinsic disorder, presumed to be a  LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT (LEA) family protein based on sequence homology, do  not enter secondary dormancy after 3 days at 40  degrees C. We hypothesized that SMP1 may  protect a heat labile protein involved in the promotion of secondary dormancy.  Recombinant SMP1 and GmPM28, its soybean (Glycine max), LEA4 homologue, protected  the labile GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATE DEHYROGENASE enzyme from heat stress, as did a  known protectant, Bovine Serum Albumin, whether the LEA protein was in solution  or attached to the bottom of microtiter plates. Maintenance of a biological  function for both recombinant LEA proteins when immobilized encouraged a  biopanning approach to screen for potential protein interactors. Phage display  with two Arabidopsis seed, T7 phage, cDNA libraries, normalized for transcripts  present in the mature, dehydrated, 12-, 24-, or 36-h imbibed seeds, were used in  biopans against recombinant SMP1 and GmPM28. Phage titer increased considerably  over four rounds of biopanning for both LEA proteins, but not for BSA, at both 25  and at 41  degrees C, regardless of the library used. The prevalence of multiple,  independent clones encoding portions of specific proteins repeatedly retrieved  from different libraries, temperatures and baits, provides evidence suggesting  these LEA proteins are discriminating which proteins they protect, a novel  finding. The identification of putative LEA-interacting proteins provides targets  for reverse genetic approaches to further dissect the induction of secondary  dormancy in seeds in response to heat stress.', '2012', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms13066582', 'Downie']
