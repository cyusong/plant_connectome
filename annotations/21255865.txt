Photosystem I (PSI), the plastocyanin-ferredoxin oxidoreductase of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, is one of the largest bioenergetic complexes known. It is composed of subunits encoded in both the chloroplast genome and the nuclear genome and thus, its assembly requires an intricate coordination of gene expression and intensive communication between the two compartments. In this review, we first briefly describe PSI structure and then focus on recent findings on the role of the two small chloroplast genome-encoded subunits PsaI and PsaJ in the stability and function of PSI in higher plants. We then address the sequence of PSI biogenesis, discuss the role of auxiliary proteins involved in cofactor insertion into the PSI apoproteins and in the establishment of protein-protein interactions during subunit assembly. Finally, we consider potential limiting steps of PSI biogenesis, and how they may contribute to the control of PSI accumulation.
