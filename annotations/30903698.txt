The two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) is a plant-sucking arthropod herbivore that feeds on a wide array of cultivated plants. In contrast to the well-characterized classical chewing herbivore salivary elicitors that promote plant defense responses, little is known about sucking herbivores' elicitors. To characterize the sucking herbivore elicitors, we explored putative salivary gland proteins of spider mites by using an Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression system or protein infiltration in damaged bean leaves. Two candidate elicitors (designated as tetranin1 (Tet1) and tetranin2 (Tet2)) triggered early leaf responses (cytosolic calcium influx and membrane depolarization) and increased the transcript abundances of defense genes in the leaves, eventually resulting in reduced survivability of T. urticae on the host leaves as well as induction of indirect plant defenses by attracting predatory mites. Tet1 and/or Tet2 also induced jasmonate, salicylate and abscisic acid biosynthesis. Notably, Tet2-induced signaling cascades were also activated via the generation of reactive oxygen species. The signaling cascades of these two structurally dissimilar elicitors are mostly overlapping but partially distinct and thus they would coordinate the direct and indirect defense responses in host plants under spider mite attack in both shared and distinct manners.

Tet1: !triggers! early leaf responses 
Tet2: !triggers! early leaf responses 
Tet1/Tet2: !induces! jasmonate, salicylate and abscisic acid biosynthesis 
Tet2: !generates! reactive oxygen species 
Tet1/Tet2: !coordinates! direct and indirect defense responses
