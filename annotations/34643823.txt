A novel cytochrome P450 from Tripterygium wilfordii, CYP81AM1, specifically catalyses the C-15 hydroxylation of dehydroabietic acid. This is the first CYP450 to be found in plants with this function. Cytochrome P450 oxygenases (CYPs) play an important role in the post-modification in biosynthesis of plant bioactive terpenoids. Here, we found that CYP81AM1 can catalyze the formation of 15-hydroxydehydroabietic acid by in vitro enzymatic reactions and in vivo yeast feeding assays. This is the first study to show that CYP81 family enzymes are involved in the hydroxylation of abietane diterpenoids. At the same time, we found that CYP81AM1 could not catalyse abietatriene and dehydroabietinol, suggesting that the occurrence of the reaction may be related to the carboxyl group. Through molecular docking and site mutations, it was found that some amino acid sites (F104, K107) near the carboxyl group had an important effect on enzyme activity, also suggesting that the carboxyl group played an important role in the occurrence of the reaction.
