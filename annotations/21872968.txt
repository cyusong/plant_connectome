Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase (FPS: EC.2.5.1.1, EC.2.5.1.10) catalyzes the formation of FPP from isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate via two successive condensation reactions. A cDNA designated CrFPS, encoding a protein showing high similarities with trans-type short FPS isoforms, was isolated from the Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus). This cDNA was shown to functionally complement the lethal FPS deletion mutant in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. At the subcellular level, while short FPS isoforms are usually described as cytosolic proteins, we showed, using transient transformations of C. roseus cells with yellow fluorescent protein-fused constructs, that CrFPS is targeted to peroxisomes. This finding is discussed in relation to the subcellular distribution of FPS isoforms in plants and animals and opens new perspectives towards the understanding of isoprenoid biosynthesis.
