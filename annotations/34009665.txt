In response to jasmonates (JAs), the JA receptor Coronatine Insensitive 1 (COI1) recruits JA-zinc-finger inflorescence meristem (ZIM)-domain (JAZ) family repressors for destruction to regulate plant growth, development, and defense. As Arabidopsis encodes 13 JAZ repressors, their functional specificity, diversity, and redundancy in JA/COI1-mediated responses remain unclear. We generated a broad range of jaz mutants based on their phylogenetic relationship to investigate their roles in JA responses. The group I JAZ6 may play an inhibitory role in resistance to Botrytis cinerea, group II (JAZ10)/III (JAZ11/12) in JA-regulated root growth inhibition and susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000, and group IV JAZ3/4/9 in flowering time delay and defense against insects. JAZs exhibit high redundancy in apical hook curvature. The undecuple jaz1/2/3/4/5/6/7/9/10/11/12 (jaz1-7,9-12) mutations enhance JA responses and suppress the phenotypes of coi1-1 in flowering time, rosette growth, and defense. The JA hypersensitivity of jaz1-7,9-12 in root growth, hook curvature, and leaf yellowing is blocked by coi1-1. jaz1-7,9-12 does not influence the stamen phenotypes of wild-type and coi1-1. jaz1-7,9-12 affects JA-regulated transcriptional profile and recovers a fraction of that in coi1-1. This study contributes to elucidating the specificity, diversity, and redundancy of JAZ members in JA/COI1-regulated growth, development, and defense responses.
