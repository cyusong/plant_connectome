The real-time translocation of iron (Fe) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Ehimehadaka no. 1) was visualized using the positron-emitting tracer (52)Fe and a positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS). PETIS allowed us to monitor Fe translocation in barley non-destructively under various conditions. In all cases, (52)Fe first accumulated at the basal part of the shoot, suggesting that this region may play an important role in Fe distribution in graminaceous plants. Fe-deficient barley showed greater translocation of (52)Fe from roots to shoots than did Fe-sufficient barley, demonstrating that Fe deficiency causes enhanced (52)Fe uptake and translocation to shoots. In the dark, translocation of (52)Fe to the youngest leaf was equivalent to or higher than that under the light condition, while the translocation of (52)Fe to the older leaves was decreased, in both Fe-deficient and Fe-sufficient barley. This suggests the possibility that the mechanism and/or pathway of Fe translocation to the youngest leaf may be different from that to the older leaves. When phloem transport in the leaf was blocked by steam treatment, (52)Fe translocation from the roots to older leaves was not affected, while (52)Fe translocation to the youngest leaf was reduced, indicating that Fe is translocated to the youngest leaf via phloem in addition to xylem. We propose a novel model in which root-absorbed Fe is translocated from the basal part of the shoots and/or roots to the youngest leaf via phloem in graminaceous plants.

Fe: !accumulates at! basal part of shoot
Fe-deficient barley: !translocates more! Fe-sufficient barley
dark condition: !equivalent or higher translocation! light condition
steam treatment: !blocks phloem transport! youngest leaf
root-absorbed Fe: !translocated to! youngest leaf via phloem
