A rosette plant of Eustoma grandiflorum requires vernalization (exposure to a period of cold temperature) and long-day conditions to promote flowering, while prolonged cold or cool temperatures in post-vernalization periods delay flowering. This study aimed to investigate the effect of growth conditions on flowering regulation in Eustoma. In Arabidopsis, vernalization suppresses a floral repressor gene, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and upregulates floral promoter genes, such as SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). We identified and characterized the Eustoma homologs of these genes. In contrast to Arabidopsis FLC, Eustoma grandiflorum FLC-like (EgFLCL) expression was upregulated by cold temperature and downregulated by subsequent warm temperature exposure. The expression of Eustoma grandiflorum SOC1-like (EgSOC1L) and FT-like (EgFTL) genes was not significantly induced during vernalization, but their transcripts increased during a warm post-vernalization period in the long days. Vernalized plants grown under cool post-vernalization temperatures exhibited higher EgFLCL expression, lower EgSOC1L and EgFTL expression and flowered later than those grown under warm temperatures. Overexpression of EgFLCL cDNA repressed flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis, whereas overexpression of EgSOC1L or EgFTL cDNA promoted flowering. Our results suggest that flowering regulation by vernalization in Eustoma differs from the paradigm developed for Arabidopsis. EgFLCL is regulated by temperature and may be involved in floral repression during cold and cool seasons. Warm- and long-day conditions following vernalization are required to induce two putative floral promoters, EgSOC1L and EgFTL, effectively.
