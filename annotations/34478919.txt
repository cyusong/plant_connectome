Dihydroxyacid dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.9) participates in metabolism of branched chain amino acids, in CoA biosynthesis and in the conversion of hydroxycitric acid that accumulates in several plants. In maize (Zea mays L.), this enzyme is encoded by the two genes (Dhad1 and Dhad2), having different patterns of their expression during germination. We have demonstrated the inhibition of Dhad1 expression by light and the opposite effect of light on Dhad2. These effects were phytochrome-dependent and involved methylation/demethylation of promoters. Incubation of maize plants in a nitrogen atmosphere resulted in Dhad1 activation peaking at 12 h, which coincided with the decrease in promoter methylation. The gene Dhad2 was activated only during the first 6 h of anoxia, with no correlation with the level of promoter methylation. Salt stress (150 mM NaCl) caused the activation of expression of Dhad2 while the expression of Dhad1 was inhibited in the first hour and then after 12 h incubation with NaCl. We conclude that the expression of two genes encoding dihydroxyacid dehydratase reveals the opposite or different patterns of regulation by light, anoxia and salinity. The mechanisms underlying these modifications involve promoter methylation and result in corresponding changes in the enzymatic activity of the conversion of hydroxycitrate to 2-oxoglutarate.
