The phenomenal increase in agricultural yields that we have witnessed in the last century has slowed down as we approach the limits of selective breeding and optimization of cultivation techniques. To support the yield increase required to feed an ever-growing population, we will have to identify new ways to boost the efficiency with which plants convert light into biomass. This challenge could potentially be tackled using state-of-the-art synthetic biology techniques to rewrite plant carbon fixation. In this review, we use recent studies to discuss and demonstrate different approaches for enhancing carbon fixation, including engineering Rubisco for higher activity, specificity, and activation; changing the expression level of enzymes within the Calvin cycle to avoid kinetic bottlenecks; introducing carbon-concentrating mechanisms such as inorganic carbon transporters, carboxysomes, and C4 metabolism; and rewiring photorespiration towards more energetically efficient routes or pathways that do not release CO2. We conclude by noting the importance of prioritizing and combining different approaches towards continuous and sustainable increase of plant productivities.
