Phytochrome B (phyB) senses the difference between darkness and light, the level of irradiance, the red/far-red ratio, and temperature. Thanks to these sensory capacities, phyB perceives whether plant organs are buried in the soil, exposed to full sunlight, in the presence of nearby vegetation, and/or under risk of heat stress. In some species, phyB perceives seasonal daylength cues. phyB affects the activity of several transcriptional regulators either by direct physical interaction or indirectly by physical interaction with proteins involved in the turnover of transcriptional regulators. Typically, interaction of a protein with phyB has either negative or positive effects on the interaction of the latter with a third party, this being another protein or DNA. Thus, phyB mediates the context-dependent modulation of the transcriptome underlying changes in plant morphology, physiology, and susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stress. phyB operates as a dynamic switch that improves carbon balance, prioritizing light interception and photosynthetic capacity in open places and the projection of the shoot towards light in the soil, under shade and in warm conditions.
