The cambial meristem is responsible for bark and wood formation in woody plants. The activity of the cambial meristem is controlled by various factors; one of them is the plant hormone cytokinin. Here, we have explored different approaches to genetically engineering cambial activity in poplar plants by the ectopic expression of a cytokinin biosynthesis gene with enhanced activity (named <i>ROCK4</i>) or of a gene encoding a constitutively active cytokinin receptor variant (<i>ROCK3</i>). Both genes are derived from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and were expressed in poplar trees under the control of their own promoter or the cambium-specific <i>pHB8</i> promoter. <i>pIPT3:ROCK4</i>- and <i>pHB8:ROCK4</i>-expressing plants were smaller than wild-type plants and formed more lateral branches; <i>pHB8:ROCK4</i> transgenic plants additionally showed an increased stem diameter. In contrast, <i>pAHK3</i><i>:ROCK3</i>- and <i>pHB8</i><i>:ROCK3</i>-expressing plants grew taller than wild type without an altered branching pattern and formed more cambial cells, leading to increased radial stem growth. The effectivity of <i>ROCK3</i> when expressed in either secondary phloem cells or in cambial cells is consistent with a dual, tissue-autonomous and non-autonomous activity of cytokinin in regulating cambial activity. We propose <i>ROCK3</i> as a novel gene to enhance biomass formation in woody plants.
