Boron (B) deficiency is an agricultural problem that causes significant yield losses in many countries. B transporters (<i>BOR</i>s) are responsible for B uptake and distribution and play important roles in yield formation. A comprehensive analysis of the <i>BOR</i> family members in common wheat is still lacking. In the present study, to clarify the molecular characterization and response to B status, genome-wide <i>TaBOR</i> genes and expression patterns were investigated. Fourteen <i>TaBOR</i> genes were identified in common wheat by a homology search. The corresponding phylogenetic tree indicated that 14 <i>TaBOR</i> genes were separately classified into subfamilies of <i>TaBOR1</i>, <i>TaBOR3</i>, and <i>TaBOR4</i>. All <i>TaBOR</i> genes had 12-14 extrons and 11-13 introns. Most <i>TaBOR</i> proteins contained 10 conserved motifs, and motifs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 constituted the conserved bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>) domain. Fourteen <i>TaBOR</i> genes were mapped on 13 chromosomes mainly distributed in the first, third, fifth, and seventh homologous groups. The promoters of <i>TaBOR</i> genes consisted of phytohormones, light responses, and stress-related cis-elements. GO analysis indicated that <i>TaBOR</i> genes were enriched in terms of transmembrane transport and ion homeostasis. <i>TaBOR</i> genes showed diverse expression profiles in different tissues. The members of the <i>TaBOR1</i> subfamily showed high expression in grains, leaves, roots, stems, and spikes, but members of the <i>TaBOR4</i> subfamily were highly expressed only in spikes and grains. RT-qPCR indicated that <i>TaBOR1-5A</i>, <i>TaBOR1-5B</i>, and <i>TaBOR1-5D</i> were induced by low B concentrations and had much higher expression in roots than in shoots. <i>TaBOR3-3A</i>, <i>TaBOR3-3B</i>, <i>TaBOR3-3D</i>, <i>TaBOR4-1A</i>, <i>TaBOR4-1B</i>, <i>TaBOR4-1D</i>, and <i>TaBOR3-4B</i> were induced by low and high B concentrations and had high expression in roots and shoots. <i>TaBOR3-4D</i> and <i>TaBOR3-7B</i> were upregulated by low and high B concentrations, respectively, but had expression only in roots. Our results provide basic information on the <i>TaBOR</i> family, which is beneficial for elucidating the functions of <i>TaBOR</i> genes to overcome the problem of B deficiency.
