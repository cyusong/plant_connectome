The developmental program by which plants respond is tightly controlled by a complex cascade in which photoreceptors perceive and transduce the light signals that drive signaling processes and direct the transcriptional reprogramming, yielding specific cellular responses. The molecular mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation include light-regulated nuclear localization (the phytochromes and UVR8) and nuclear accumulation (the cryptochrome, cry2) of photoreceptors. This regulatory cascade also includes master regulatory transcription factors (TFs) that bridge photoreceptor activation with chromatin remodeling and regulate the expression of numerous light-responsive genes. Light signaling-related TFs often function as signal convergence points in concert with TFs in other signaling pathways to integrate complex endogenous and environmental cues that help the plant adapt to the surrounding environment. Increasing evidence suggests that chromatin modifications play a critical role in regulating light-responsive gene expression and provide an additional layer of light signaling regulation. Here, we provide an overview of our current knowledge of the transcriptional regulatory network involved in the light response, particularly the roles of TFs and chromatin in regulating light-responsive gene expression.
