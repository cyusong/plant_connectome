['34015128', 'Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methylation is a pivotal process in the assembly and  activity of ribosomes, which in turn play vital roles in the growth, development  and stress responses of plants. Although few methyltransferases responsible for  rRNA methylation have been identified in plant chloroplasts, the nature and  function of these enzymes in chloroplasts remain largely unknown. In this study,  we characterized ArabidopsisRsmD (At3g28460), an ortholog of the  methyltransferase responsible for N2-methylguanosine (m2G) modification of 16S  rRNA in Escherichia coli. Confocal microscopic analysis of an RsmD- green  fluorescent protein fusion protein revealed that RsmD is localized to  chloroplasts. Primer extension analysis indicated that RsmD is responsible for  m2G methylation at position 915 in the 16S rRNA of Arabidopsis chloroplasts.  Under cold stress, rsmd mutant plants exhibited retarded growth, i.e. had shorter  roots, lower fresh weight and pale-green leaves, compared with wild-type (WT)  plants. However, these phenotypes were not detected in response to drought or  salt stress. Notably, the rsmd mutant was hypersensitive to erythromycin or  lincomycin and accumulated fewer chloroplast proteins compared with the WT,  suggesting that RsmD influences translation in chloroplasts. Complementation  lines expressing RsmD in the rsmd mutant background recovered WT phenotypes.  Importantly, RsmD harbored RNA methyltransferase activity. Collectively, the  findings of this study indicate that RsmD is a chloroplast 16S rRNA  methyltransferase responsible for m2G915 modification that plays a role in the  adaptation of Arabidopsisto cold stress.', '2021 Oct 11', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcab060', 'ORCID:']
