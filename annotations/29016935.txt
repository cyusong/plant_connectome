Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is an ancient interaction between plants and fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota. In exchange for photosynthetically fixed carbon, the fungus provides the plant host with greater access to soil nutrients via an extensive network of root-external hyphae. Here, to determine the impact of the symbiosis on the host ionome, the concentration of 19 elements was determined in the roots and leaves of a panel of 30 maize varieties, grown under phosphorus-limiting conditions, with or without inoculation with the fungus Funneliformis mosseae. Although the most recognized benefit of the symbiosis to the host plant is greater access to soil phosphorus, the concentration of a number of other elements responded significantly to inoculation across the panel as a whole. In addition, variety-specific effects indicated the importance of plant genotype to the response. Clusters of elements were identified that varied in a co-ordinated manner across genotypes, and that were maintained between non-inoculated and inoculated plants.
