The development of efficient pipelines for the bioconversion of grass lignocellulosic feedstocks is challenging due to the limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the synthesis, deposition, and degradation of the varying polymers unique to grass cell walls. Here, we describe a large-scale forward genetic approach resulting in the identification of a collection of chemically mutagenized maize mutants with diverse alterations in their cell wall attributes such as crystalline cellulose content or hemicellulose composition. Saccharification yield, i.e. the amount of lignocellulosic glucose (Glc) released by means of enzymatic hydrolysis, is increased in two of the mutants and decreased in the remaining six. These mutants, termed <i>candy-leaf</i> (<i>cal)</i>, show no obvious plant growth or developmental defects despite associated differences in their lignocellulosic composition. The identified <i>cal</i> mutants are a valuable tool not only to understand recalcitrance of grass lignocellulosics to enzymatic deconstruction but also to decipher grass-specific aspects of cell wall biology once the genetic basis, i.e. the location of the mutation, has been identified.
