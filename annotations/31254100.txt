Site-specific changes of photosynthesis, a relatively new concept, can be used to improve the productivity of critical food crops to mitigate the foreseen food crisis. Global food security is threatened by an increasing population and the effects of climate change. Large yield improvements were achieved in major cereal crops between the 1950s and 1980s through the Green Revolution. However, we are currently experiencing a significant decline in yield progress. Of the many approaches to improved cereal yields, exploitation of the mode of photosynthesis has been intensely studied. Even though the C<sub>4</sub> pathway is considered the most efficient, mainly because of the carbon concentrating mechanisms around the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, which minimize photorespiration, much is still unknown about the specific gene regulation of this mode of photosynthesis. Most of the critical cereal crops, including wheat and rice, are categorized as C<sub>3</sub> plants based on the photosynthesis of major photosynthetic organs. However, recent findings raise the possibility of different modes of photosynthesis occurring at different sites in the same plant and/or in plants grown in different habitats. That is, it seems possible that efficient photosynthetic traits may be expressed in specific organs, even though the major photosynthetic pathway is C<sub>3</sub>. Knowledge of site-specific differences in photosynthesis, coupled with site-specific regulation of gene expression, may therefore hold a potential to enhance the yields of economically important C<sub>3</sub> crops.
