Cell expression is coordinated with chloroplast division in diploid and tetraploid Arabidopsis thaliana, polyploidy promoted the expansion of mesophyll cells and chloroplast division in A. thaliana. Cell development and differentiation are always accompanied by cell expansion and chloroplast division in plants, but the relationship between them is still relatively unknown. To confirm the relationship between cell expansion and chloroplast division during the leaf development process of diploid and tetraploid Arabidopsis thaliana, we systematically analyzed the expansion of mesophyll cells and the division of chloroplasts through cytological observation and gene-expression characteristics. As a result, in diploid and tetraploid A. thaliana, there were two peaks in both mesophyll cell expansion and chloroplast division during the leaf development process. Tetraploid A. thaliana mesophyll cells were larger and contained more chloroplasts than diploid A. thaliana mesophyll cells, which indicated that cell division and cell expansion were coordinated with chloroplast division in A. thaliana and that polyploidy further promoted mesophyll cell expansion and chloroplast division.
