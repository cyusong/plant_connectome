['34638794', 'Environmental acclimation ability plays a key role in plant growth, although the  mechanism remains unclear. Here, we determined the involvement of Arabidopsis  thaliana PLANT DEFENSIN 1 gene AtPDF1.5 in the adaptation to low nitrogen (LN)  levels and cadmium (Cd) stress. Histochemical analysis revealed that AtPDF1.5 was  mainly expressed in the nodes and carpopodium and was significantly induced in  plants exposed to LN conditions and Cd stress. Subcellular localization analysis  revealed that AtPDF1.5 was cell wall- and cytoplasm-localized. AtPDF1.5  overexpression significantly enhanced adaptation to LN and Cd stress and enhanced  the distribution of metallic elements. The functional disruption of AtPDF1.5  reduced adaptations to LN and Cd stress and impaired metal distribution. Under LN  conditions, the nitrate transporter AtNRT1.5 expression was upregulated. Nitrate  transporter AtNRT1.8 expression was downregulated when AtPDF1.5 was  overexpressed, resulting in enhanced transport of NO(3)(-) to shoots. In response  to Cd treatment, AtPDF1.5 regulated the expression of metal transporter genes  AtHMP07, AtNRAMP4, AtNRAMP1, and AtHIPP3, resulting in higher Cd accumulation in  the shoots. We conclude that AtPDF1.5 is involved in the processing or  transmission of signal substances and plays an important role in the remediation  of Cd pollution and LN adaptation.', '2021 Sep 28', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms221910455', 'ORCID:']
