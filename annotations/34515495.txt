Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is an important gene regulatory mechanism shaping the transcriptome. AtMC1 is an <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> type I metacaspase that positively regulates the hypersensitive response. Here, we found that AtMC1 is involved in the regulation of plant immunity to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 and is physically associated with Sm-like4 (LSM4), which is involved in pre-mRNA splicing. AtMC1 and LSM4 protein levels both increased with their coexpression as compared with their separate expression in vivo. Like AtMC1, LSM4 negatively regulates plant immunity to <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 infection. By RNA sequencing, AtMC1 was shown to modulate the splicing of many pre-mRNAs, including <i>4CL3</i>, which is a negative regulator of plant immunity. Thus, AtMC1 plays a regulatory role in pre-mRNA splicing, which might contribute to AtMC1-mediated plant immunity.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
