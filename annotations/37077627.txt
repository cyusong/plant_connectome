Rapid, non-destructive and reliable detection of the oil content of corn seeds is important for development of high-oil corn. However, determination of the oil content is difficult using traditional methods for seed composition analysis. In this study, a hand-held Raman spectrometer was used with a spectral peak decomposition algorithm to determine the oil contents of corn seeds. Mature and waxy Zhengdan 958 corn seeds and mature Jingke 968 corn seeds were analyzed. Raman spectra were obtained in four regions of interest in the embryo of the seed. After analysis of the spectra, a characteristic spectral peak for the oil content was identified. A Gaussian curve fitting spectral peak decomposition algorithm was used to decompose the characteristic spectral peak of oil at 1657 cm<sup>-1</sup>. This peak was used to determine the Raman spectral peak intensity for the oil content in the embryo and differences in the oil contents among seeds of varying maturity and different varieties. This method is feasible and effective for detection of corn seed oil.
