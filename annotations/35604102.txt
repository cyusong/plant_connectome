Although the role of ethylene in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit ripening has been intensively studied, its role in tomato fruit growth remains poorly understood. In addition, the relationship between ethylene and the developmental factors NON-RIPENING (NOR) and RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN) during ripening is under debate. Here, we carried out comprehensive genetic analyses of genome-edited mutants of tomato ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (SlEIN2), four EIN3-like genes (SlEIL1-4), and three EIN3 BINDING F-box protein genes (SlEBF1-3). Both slein2-1 and the high-order sleil mutant (sleil1 sleil2 sleil3/SlEIL3 sleil4) showed reduced fruit size, mainly due to decreased auxin biosynthesis. During fruit maturation, slein2 mutants displayed the complete cessation of ripening, which was partially rescued by slebf1 but not slebf2 or slebf3. We also discovered that ethylene directly activates the expression of the developmental genes NOR, RIN, and FRUITFULL1 (FUL1) via SlEIL proteins. Indeed, overexpressing these genes partially rescued the ripening defects of slein2-1. Finally, the signal intensity of the ethylene burst during fruit maturation was intimately connected with the progression of full ripeness. Collectively, our work uncovers a critical role of ethylene in fruit growth and supports a molecular framework of ripening control in which the developmental factors NOR, RIN, and FUL1 act downstream of ethylene signaling.
