['21705385', 'Eukaryotic cells use COPII-coated carriers for endoplasmic reticulum  (ER)-to-Golgi protein transport. Selective cargo capture into ER-derived carriers  is largely driven by the SEC24 component of the COPII coat. The Arabidopsis  genome encodes three AtSEC24 genes with overlapping expression profiles but it is  yet to be established whether the AtSEC24 proteins have overlapping roles in  plant growth and development. Taking advantage of Arabidopsis thaliana as a model  plant system for studying gene function in vivo, through reciprocal crosses,  pollen characterization, and complementation tests, evidence is provided for a  role for AtSEC24A in the male gametophyte. It is established that an AtSEC24A  loss-of-function mutation is tolerated in the female gametophyte but that it  causes defects in pollen leading to failure of male transmission of the AtSEC24A  mutation. These data provide a characterization of plant SEC24 family in planta  showing incompletely overlapping functions of the AtSEC24 isoforms. The results  also attribute a novel role to SEC24 proteins in a multicellular model system,  specifically in male fertility.', '2011 Oct', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/err174', 'Brandizzi']
