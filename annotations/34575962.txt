The <i>SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP)</i> gene is a transcription factor that integrates flowering signals and plays an important role in the regulation of flowering time in many plants. In this study, two full-length cDNA sequences of <i>SVP</i> homologous genes-<i>MiSVP1</i> and <i>MiSVP2</i>-were obtained from 'SiJiMi' mango. Sequence analysis showed that the <i>MiSVPs</i> had typical MADS-box domains and were highly conserved between each other. The analysis of expression patterns showed that the <i>MiSVPs</i> were expressed during flower development and highly expressed in vegetative tissues, with low expression in flowers/buds. The <i>MiSVPs</i> could responded to low temperature, NaCl, and PEG treatment. Subcellular localization revealed that MiSVP1 and MiSVP2 were localized in the nucleus. Transformation of <i>Arabidopsis</i> revealed that overexpression of <i>MiSVP1</i> delayed flowering time, overexpression of <i>MiSVP2</i> accelerated flowering time, and neither <i>MiSVP1</i> nor <i>MiSVP2</i> had an effect on the number of rosette leaves. Overexpression of <i>MiSVP1</i> increased the expression of <i>AtFLC</i> and decreased the expression of <i>AtFT</i> and <i>AtSOC1</i>, and overexpression of <i>MiSVP2</i> increased the expression levels of <i>AtSOC1</i> and <i>AtFT</i> and decreased the expression levels of <i>AtFLC</i>. Point-to-point and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that MiSVP1 and MiSVP2 could interact with SEP1-1, SOC1D, and AP1-2. These results suggest that <i>MiSVP1</i> and <i>MiSVP2</i> may play a significant roles in the flowering process of mango.
