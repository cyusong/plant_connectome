Radiocesium accumulated in the soil by nuclear accidents is a major environmental concern. The transport process of cesium (Cs<sup>+</sup>) is tightly linked to the indispensable plant nutrient potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) as they both belong to the group I alkali metals with similar chemical properties. Most of the transporters that had been characterized to date as Cs<sup>+</sup> transporters are directly or indirectly linked to K<sup>+</sup>. Using a combinatorial approach of physiology, genetics, cell biology, and root uptake assay, here we identified two ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, ABCG37 and ABCG33, as facilitators of Cs<sup>+</sup> influx. A gain-of-function mutant of ABCG37 (abcg37-1) showed increased sensitivity to Cs<sup>+</sup>-induced root growth inhibition, while the double knockout mutant of ABCG33 and ABCG37 (abcg33-1abcg37-2) showed resistance, whereas the single loss-of-function mutants of ABCG33 and ABCG37 did not show any alteration in Cs<sup>+</sup> response. In planta short-term radioactive Cs<sup>+</sup>-uptake assay along with growth and uptake assays in a heterologous system confirmed ABCG33 and ABCG37 as Cs<sup>+</sup>-uptake carriers. Potassium response and content were unaffected in the double-mutant background and yeast cells lacking potassium-uptake carriers transformed with ABCG33 and ABCG37 failed to grow in the absence of K<sup>+</sup>, confirming that Cs<sup>+</sup> uptake by ABCG33 and ABCG37 is independent of K<sup>+</sup>. Collectively, this work identified two ABC proteins as new Cs<sup>+</sup>-influx carriers that act redundantly and independent of the K<sup>+</sup>-uptake pathway.
