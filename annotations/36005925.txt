Fine tuning the progression of leaf senescence is important for plant fitness in nature, while the "staygreen" phenotype with delayed leaf senescence has been considered a valuable agronomic trait in crop genetic improvement. In this study, a switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) CCCH-type Zinc finger gene, Strong Staygreen (PvSSG), was characterized as a suppressor of leaf senescence as overexpression or suppression of the gene led to delayed or accelerated leaf senescence, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis marked that chlorophyll (Chl) catabolic pathway genes were involved in the PvSSG-regulated leaf senescence. PvSSG was identified as a nucleus-localized protein with no transcriptional activity. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified its interacting proteins, including a pair of paralogous transcription factors, PvNAP1/2 (NAC-LIKE, ACTIVATED BY AP3/PI). Overexpression of PvNAPs led to precocious leaf senescence at least partially by directly targeting and transactivating Chl catabolic genes to promote Chl degradation. PvSSG, through protein-protein interaction, repressed the DNA-binding efficiency of PvNAPs and alleviated its transactivating effect on downstream genes, thereby functioning as a "brake" in the progression of leaf senescence. Moreover, overexpression of PvSSG resulted in up to 47% higher biomass yield and improved biomass feedstock quality, reiterating the importance of leaf senescence regulation in the genetic improvement of switchgrass and other feedstock crops.
