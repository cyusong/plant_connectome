['23741064', 'Ca(2+) has been established as an important second messenger regulating pollen  germination and tube growth. However, to date, only a few signaling components  have been identified to decode and relay Ca(2+) signals in growing pollen tubes.  Here, we report a function for the calcineurin B-like (CBL) Ca(2+) sensor  proteins CBL1 and CBL9 from Arabidopsis in pollen germination and tube growth.  Both proteins are expressed in mature pollen and pollen tubes and impair pollen  tube growth and morphology if transiently overexpressed in tobacco pollen. The  induction of these phenotypes requires efficient plasma membrane targeting of  CBL1 and is independent of Ca(2+) binding to the fourth EF-hand of CBL1.  Overexpression of CBL1 or its closest homolog CBL9 in Arabidopsis renders pollen  germination and tube growth hypersensitive towards high external K(+)  concentrations while disruption of CBL1 and CBL9 reduces pollen tube growth under  low K(+) conditions. Together, our data identify a crucial function for CBL1 and  CBL9 in pollen germination and tube growth and suggest a model in which both  proteins act at the plasma membrane through regulation of K(+) homeostasis.', '2013 Jul', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/sst095', 'Kudla']
