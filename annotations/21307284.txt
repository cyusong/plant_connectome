Heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs) regulate gene expression in response to environmental stress. The Hsf network in plants is controlled at the transcriptional level by cooperation of distinct Hsf members and by interaction with chaperones. We found two general mechanisms of Hsf regulation by chaperones while analyzing the three major Hsfs, A1, A2, and B1, in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). First, Hsp70 and Hsp90 regulate Hsf function by direct interactions. Hsp70 represses the activity of HsfA1, including its DNA binding, and the coactivator function of HsfB1 in the complex with HsfA2, while the DNA binding activity of HsfB1 is stimulated by Hsp90. Second, Hsp90 affects the abundance of HsfA2 and HsfB1 by modulating hsfA2 transcript degradation involved in regulation of the timing of HsfA2 synthesis. By contrast, HsfB1 binding to Hsp90 and to DNA are prerequisites for targeting this Hsf for proteasomal degradation, which also depends on a sequence element in its carboxyl-terminal domain. Thus, HsfB1 represents an Hsp90 client protein that, by interacting with the chaperone, is targeted for, rather than protected from, degradation. Based on these findings, we propose a versatile regulatory regime involving Hsp90, Hsp70, and the three Hsfs in the control of heat stress response.
