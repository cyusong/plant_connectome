SKP1 (S-phase kinase-associated protein1) proteins are key members of the SCF (SKP-cullin-F-box protein) E3 ligase complexes that ubiquitinate target proteins and play diverse roles in plant biology. However, in comparison with other members of the SCF complex, knowledge of SKP1-like proteins is very limited in plants. In the present work, we report that Arabidopsis SKP1-like protein13 (ASK13) is differentially regulated in different organs during seed development and germination and is up-regulated in response to abiotic stress. Yeast two-hybrid library screening and subsequent assessment of in vivo interactions through bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis revealed that ASK13 not only interacts with F-box proteins but also with other proteins that are not components of SCF complexes. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that ASK13 not only exists as a monomer but also as a homo-oligomer or heteromer with other ASK proteins. Functional analysis using ASK13 overexpression and knockdown lines showed that ASK13 positively influences seed germination and seedling growth, particularly under abiotic stress. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that apart from participation to form SCF complexes, ASK13 interacts with several other proteins and is implicated in different cellular processes distinct from protein degradation.
