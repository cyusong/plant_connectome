Rac/Rop proteins play important roles in the regulation of cell growth and plant defense responses. However, the function of Rac/Rop proteins in wheat remains largely unknown. In this study, a small G protein gene, designated as <i>TaRac6</i>, was characterized from wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) in response to <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>) and was found to be highly homologous to the Rac proteins identified in other plant species. Transient expression analyses of the TaRac6-GFP fusion protein in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves showed that TaRac6 was localized in the whole cell. Furthermore, transient expression of TaRac6 inhibited Bax-triggered plant cell death (PCD) in <i>N. benthamiana</i>. Transcript accumulation of <i>TaRac6</i> was increased at 24 h post-inoculation (hpi) in the compatible interaction between wheat and <i>Pst</i>, while it was not induced in an incompatible interaction. More importantly, silencing of <i>TaRac6</i> by virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) enhanced the resistance of wheat (Suwon 11) to <i>Pst</i> (CYR31) by producing fewer uredinia. Histological observations revealed that the hypha growth of <i>Pst</i> was markedly inhibited along with more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated in the <i>TaRac6</i>-silenced leaves in response to <i>Pst</i>. Moreover, transcript levels of <i>TaCAT</i> were significantly down-regulated, while those of <i>TaSOD</i> and <i>TaNOX</i> were significantly up-regulated. These results suggest that <i>TaRac6</i> functions as a potential susceptibility factor, which negatively regulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst in the wheat-<i>Pst</i> interaction.
