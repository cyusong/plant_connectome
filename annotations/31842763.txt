Gametogenesis is a key step in the production of ovules or pollen in higher plants. The sex-determination aspects of gametogenesis have been well characterized in the model plant Arabidopsis. However, little is known about this process in androdioecious plants. Tapiscia sinensis Oliv. is a functionally androdioecious tree, with both male and hermaphroditic individuals. Hermaphroditic flowers (HFs) are female-fertile flowers that can produce functional pollen and set fruits. However, compared with male flowers (MFs), the pollen viability and number of pollen grains per flower are markedly reduced in HFs. MFs are female-sterile flowers that fail to set fruit and that eventually drop. Compared with HF, a notable cause of MF female sterility in T. sinensis is when the early gynoecium meristem is disrupted. During the early stage of HF development (stage 6), the ring meristem begins to form as a ridge around the center of the flower. At this stage, the internal fourth-whorl organ is stem-like rather than carpelloid in MF. A total of 52,945 unigenes were identified as transcribed in MF and HF. A number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and metabolic pathways were detected as involved in the development of the gynoecium, especially the ovule, carpel and style. At the early gynoecium development stage, DEGs were shown to function in the metabolic pathways regulating ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction (upstream regulator), auxin, cytokinin transport and signalling, and sex determination (or flower meristem identity). Pathways for the female sterility model were initially proposed to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of gynoecium development at early stages in T. sinensis.
