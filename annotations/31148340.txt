Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup> ) has been recently described as a beneficial macronutrient, playing specific roles in promoting plant growth and water-use efficiency (WUE). However, it is still unclear how Cl<sup>-</sup> could be beneficial, especially in comparison with nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ), an essential source of nitrogen that shares with Cl<sup>-</sup> similar physical and osmotic properties, as well as common transport mechanisms. In tobacco plants, macronutrient levels of Cl<sup>-</sup> specifically reduce stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub> ) without a concomitant reduction in the net photosynthesis rate (A<sub>N</sub> ). As stomata-mediated water loss through transpiration is inherent in the need of C<sub>3</sub> plants to capture CO<sub>2</sub> , simultaneous increase in photosynthesis and WUE is of great relevance to achieve a sustainable increase in C<sub>3</sub> crop productivity. Our results showed that Cl<sup>-</sup> -mediated stimulation of larger leaf cells leads to a reduction in stomatal density, which in turn reduces g<sub>s</sub> and water consumption. Conversely, Cl<sup>-</sup> improves mesophyll diffusion conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> (g<sub>m</sub> ) and photosynthetic performance due to a higher surface area of chloroplasts exposed to the intercellular airspace of mesophyll cells, possibly as a consequence of the stimulation of chloroplast biogenesis. A key finding of this study is the simultaneous improvement of A<sub>N</sub> and WUE due to macronutrient Cl<sup>-</sup> nutrition. This work identifies relevant and specific functions in which Cl<sup>-</sup> participates as a beneficial macronutrient for higher plants, uncovering a sustainable approach to improve crop yield.
