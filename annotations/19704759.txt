Cigarette smoking is known to cause a decrease in NO production in man resulting in a variety of pathological effects, including vascular dysfunction. Aqueous extracts of cigarette and cigarette smoke contain chemical inhibitors to NO-synthases, a heme-containing cytochrome P450 enzymes. More recently, it was shown that freshly harvested leaves from the tobacco plant (Nicotiana tabacum, Solanaceae) also contain chemical inhibitors to neuronal NO-synthase (nNOS). Examination of leaves from 32 other plants representing diverse members of the plant kingdom showed that 17 other plants, besides tobacco, contain these chemical inhibitors. Of all these plants, 16 are members of the core asterids flowering plant group and 6 are members of the Solanaceae family. Although the identity of the chemicals is not known, perhaps the closely related plants contain the same or similar compounds that inhibit nNOS. The inhibitory effects are not attributable to nicotine. The discovery of these chemicals and their further characterization may help to explain the loss of nNOS in smokers. In this addendum, we discuss these results in light of the effect of tobacco-derived chemicals in inhibiting P450 cytochromes, as well as our thoughts on how the inactivation of nNOS leads to its selective downregulation through proteolytic degradation.
