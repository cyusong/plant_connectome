Silicon (Si) alleviates cadmium (Cd) toxicity and accumulation in a number of plant species, but the exact molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of Si on Cd toxicity and accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa) by using two mutants (lsi1 and lsi2) defective in Si uptake and their wild types (WTs). Root elongation was decreased with increasing external Cd concentrations in both WTs and mutants, but Si did not show an alleviative effect on Cd toxicity in all lines. By contrast, the Cd concentration in both the shoots and roots was decreased by Si in the WTs, but not in the mutants. Furthermore, Si supply resulted in a decreased Cd concentration in the root cell sap and xylem sap in the WTs, but not in the mutants. Pre-treatment with Si also decreased Cd accumulation in the WTs, but not in the mutants. Silicon slightly decreased Cd accumulation in the cell wall of the roots. The expression level of OsNramp5 and OsHMA2 was down-regulated by Si in the WTs, but not in the mutants. These results indicate that the Si-decreased Cd accumulation was caused by down-regulating transporter genes involved in Cd uptake and translocation in rice.
