<i>Rhizobium vitis</i> strain VAT03-9 (MAFF 211676) is a causal agent of crown gall disease in grapevine. It is one of the pathogenic strains of <i>R. vitis</i> isolated from graft unions of grapevine in Okayama Prefecture, Japan. Inoculation tests verified its virulence for gall formation on grapevine, tomato, and sunflower. It harbors tumor-inducing plasmid. Here, we present the complete genome sequence with annotation of <i>R. vitis</i> VAR03-9 obtained by assembling reads from PacBio and Illumina-sequencers. This genome sequence should be useful for the analyses of pathogenicity and evolutionary lineage of the pathogens of crown gall disease.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).
