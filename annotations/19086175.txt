In Antirrhinum, several unique regulations of the transposon, Tam3, have been described. Tam3 activity in Antirrhinum is strictly controlled by the growing temperature of plants (low-temperature-dependent transposition: LTDT), by chromosomal position of Tam3 copy and by two specific repressor genes Stabiliser (St) and New Stabiliser (NSt). Here, the effects of the St and NSt loci on Tam3 transposition are compared. In cotyledons and hypocotyls, Tam3 is active even at high growing temperatures, indicating that LTDT does not operate when these organs are developing. This developmental regulation of Tam3 activity is differentially influenced by the St and NSt loci: St permits Tam3 transposition in cotyledons and hypocotyls, whereas NSt suppresses it in these organs. The effects of these host genes on Tam3 activity at the molecular level were examined. It was found that neither of these genes inhibits the transcription of the Tam3 transposase gene nor its translation, and that the Tam3 transposase has the potential to catalyze transposition in the St and NSt lines. The differences between the effects of St and NSt imply that they regulate Tam3 activity independently. Our molecular data indicate that their influence on Tam3 transposition seems to be nonepigenetic; possible mechanisms for their activity are discussed.
