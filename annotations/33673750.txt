This paper describes the isolation of an algicidal strain, <i>Stenotrophomonas rhizophila</i> KC1, from mangrove (<i>Kandelia candel</i>) and its genome, which was sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology. The genome is 5.93 Mb with a G+C content of 63.17%. A total of 3,352 functional proteins were assigned according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes categories. A total of 11,586 protein-coding genes, 73 transfer RNA genes, and 17 ribosomal RNA genes were obtained. <i>In silico</i> genome annotation protocols identified 83 putative quorum sensing (QS) genes, and the algicidal potential of KC1 was related with the QS genes (for example <i>LuxI-LuxR</i> genes). Collectively, these data suggest that KC1 may be an antialgal bacterium whose behavior can be modulated by QS signaling. The annotated genome sequence of this strain may represent a valuable tool for studying algae-bacteria interactions and developing microbe-based methods for controlling harmful algae.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
