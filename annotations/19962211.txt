NAC proteins comprise one of the largest families of transcription factors in the plant genome. They are known to be involved in various aspects of plant development, but the functions of most of them have not yet been determined. ANAC036, a member of the Arabidopsis NAC transcription factor family, contains unique sequences that are conserved among various NAC proteins found in other plant species. Expression analysis of the ANAC036 gene indicated that this gene was strongly expressed in leaves. Transgenic plants overexpressing the ANAC036 gene showed a semidwarf phenotype. The lengths of leaf blades, petioles and stems of these plants were smaller than those in wild-type plants. Microscopy revealed that cell sizes in leaves and stems of these plants were smaller than those in wild-type plants. These findings suggested that ANAC036 and its orthologues are involved in the growth of leaf cells.
