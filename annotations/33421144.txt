The bipolar spindle structure in meiosis is essential for faithful chromosome segregation. PUTATIVE RECOMBINATION INITIATION DEFECT 1 (PRD1) previously has been shown to participate in the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). However, the role of PRD1 in meiotic spindle assembly has not been elucidated. Here, we reveal by both genetic analysis and immunostaining technology that PRD1 is involved in spindle assembly in rice (Oryza sativa) meiosis. We show that DSB formation and bipolar spindle assembly are disturbed in prd1 meiocytes. PRD1 signals display a dynamic pattern of localization from covering entire chromosomes at leptotene to congregating at the centromere region after leptotene. Centromeric localization of PRD1 signals depends on the organization of leptotene chromosomes, but not on DSB formation and axis establishment. PRD1 exhibits interaction and co-localization with several kinetochore components. We also find that bi-orientation of sister kinetochores within a univalent induced by mutation of REC8 can restore bipolarity in prd1. Furthermore, PRD1 directly interacts with REC8 and SGO1, suggesting that PRD1 may play a role in regulating the orientation of sister kinetochores. Taken together, we speculate that PRD1 promotes bipolar spindle assembly, presumably by modulating the orientation of sister kinetochores in rice meiosis.
