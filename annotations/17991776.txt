['17991776', 'Cutin and suberin are the two major lipid-based polymers of plants. Cutin is the  structural polymer of the epidermal cuticle, the waterproof layer covering  primary aerial organs and which is often the structure first encountered by  phytopathogens. Suberin contributes to the control of diffusion of water and  solutes across internal root tissues and in periderms. The enzymes responsible  for assembly of the cutin polymer are largely unknown. We have identified two  Arabidopsis acyltransferases essential for cutin biosynthesis,  glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) 4 and GPAT8. Double knockouts  gpat4/gpat8 were strongly reduced in cutin and were less resistant to desiccation  and to infection by the fungus Alternaria brassicicola. They also showed striking  defects in stomata structure including a lack of cuticular ledges between guard  cells, highlighting the importance of cutin in stomatal biology. Overexpression  of GPAT4 or GPAT8 in Arabidopsis increased the content of C16 and C18 cutin  monomers in leaves and stems by 80%. In order to modify cutin composition, the  acyltransferase GPAT5 and the cytochrome P450-dependent fatty acyl oxidase  CYP86A1, two enzymes associated with suberin biosynthesis, were overexpressed.  When both enzymes were overexpressed together the epidermal polyesters  accumulated new C20 and C22 omega-hydroxyacids and alpha,omega-diacids typical of  suberin, and the fine structure and water-barrier function of the cuticle were  altered. These results identify GPATs as partners of fatty acyl oxidases in lipid  polyester synthesis and indicate that their cooverexpression provides a strategy  to probe the role of cutin composition and quantity in the function of plant  cuticles.', '2007 Nov 13', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0706984104', 'Ohlrogge']
