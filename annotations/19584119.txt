Climate change is projected to have a significant impact on temperature and precipitation profiles in the Mediterranean basin. The incidence and severity of drought will become commonplace and this will reduce the productivity of rain-fed crops such as durum wheat. Genetic diversity is the material basis for crop improvement and plant breeding has exploited naturally occurring variation to deliver cultivars with improved resistance to abiotic stresses. The coupling of new genomic tools, technologies, and resources with genetic approaches is essential to underpin wheat breeding through marker-assisted selection and hence mitigate climate change. Improvements in crop performance under abiotic stresses have primarily targeted yield-related traits and it is anticipated that the application of genomic technologies will introduce new target traits for consideration in wheat breeding for resistance to drought. Many traits relating to the plant's response and adaptation to drought are complex and multigenic, and quantitative genetics coupled with genomic technologies have the potential to dissect complex genetic traits and to identify regulatory loci, genes and networks. Full realization of our abilities to manipulate metabolism, transduction pathways, and transcription factors for crop improvement ultimately relies on our basic understanding of the regulation of plant networks at all levels of function.
