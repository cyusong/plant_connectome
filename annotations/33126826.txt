Spliceosomes are large complexes regulating pre-mRNA processing in eukaryotes. Arabidopsis <i>JANUS</i> encodes a putative subunit of spliceosome`. We recently demonstrated that JANUS plays an essential role during early embryogenesis and root meristem development. Instead of mediating pre-mRNA splicing as a subunit of spliceosome, JANUS regulates the transcription of key genes by recruiting RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). Here, we summarize our latest findings and provide insights into the regulation of JANUS during Arabidopsis development.

JANUS: !encodes! subunit of spliceosome
JANUS: !plays essential role! early embryogenesis and root meristem development
JANUS: !regulates transcription! key genes
JANUS: !recruits! RNA Polymerase II (Pol II)
