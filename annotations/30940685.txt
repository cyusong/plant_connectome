The major root system of cereals consists of crown roots (or adventitious roots), which are important for anchoring plants in the soil and for water and nutrient uptake. However, the molecular basis of crown root formation is largely unknown. Here, we isolated a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) mutant with fewer crown roots, named <i>lower crown root number1</i> (<i>lcrn1</i>). Map-based cloning revealed that <i>lcrn1</i> is caused by a mutation of a putative transcription factor-coding gene, <i>O. sativa SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE3</i> (<i>OsSPL3</i>). We demonstrate that the point mutation in <i>lcrn1</i> perturbs the<i>O. sativa</i> microRNA156 (OsmiR156)-directed cleavage of <i>OsSPL3</i> transcripts, resulting in the mutant phenotype. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays of OsSPL3 binding sites and RNA sequencing of differentially expressed transcripts in <i>lcrn1</i> further identified potential direct targets of OsSPL3 in basal nodes, including a MADS-box transcription factor, OsMADS50. <i>OsMADS50-</i>overexpressing plants produced fewer crown roots, phenocopying <i>lcrn1</i>, while knocking out <i>OsMADS50</i> in the <i>lcrn1</i> background reversed this phenotype. We also show that <i>OsSPL12</i>, another OsmiR156 target gene, regulates <i>OsMADS50</i> and crown root development. Taken together, our findings suggest a novel regulatory pathway in which the OsmiR156-<i>OsSPL3/OsSPL12</i> module directly activates <i>OsMADS50</i> in the node to regulate crown root development in rice.
