['17764945', 'Differences in life-history strategy are thought to contribute to adaptation to  specific environmental conditions. Among life-history traits in plants, flowering  time and shoot morphology are particularly important for reproductive success.  Even though flowering time and shoot morphology are linked, the evolutionary  changes in the genetic circuitry that simultaneously affects both traits remain  obscure. Here, we have identified changes in a putative pre-mRNA processing  factor, HUA2, as being responsible for the distinct shoot morphology and  flowering behavior in Sy-0, a natural strain of Arabidopsis. HUA2 has previously  been shown to positively regulate two MADS box genes affecting flowering time  (FLOWERING LOCUS C [FLC]) and floral patterning (AGAMOUS [AG]) [1, 2]. We  demonstrate that natural changes in HUA2 activity have opposite effects on its  known functions, thus having implications for the coordinate control of induction  and maintenance of floral fate. The changes in Sy-0 lead to enhanced FLC  expression, resulting in an enlarged basal rosette and aerial rosettes, whereas  suppression of AG function favors a reversion of floral meristems from  determinate to indeterminate development. Natural variation in HUA2 activity thus  coordinates changes in two important life-history traits, flowering time and  shoot morphology.', '2007 Sep 4', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2007.07.059', 'Grbic']
