The emergence of functional phenomics signifies the rebirth of physiology as a 21st century science through the use of advanced sensing technologies and big data analytics. Functional phenomics seeks to fill the significant knowledge gaps that still exist in the relationship of plant phenotype to function. Here, a general approach for the theory and practice of functional phenomics is outlined. The functional phenomics pipeline is proposed as a general method for conceptualizing, measuring, and validating utility of plant phenes, or elemental units of phenotype. The functional phenomics pipeline begins with ideotype development. Second, a phenotyping platform is developed to maximize the throughput of phene measurements. Target phenes and indicators of plant function, or performance, are measured in a mapping population. Forward genetics allows genetic mapping, while functional phenomics links phenes to plant performance. Based on these data, genotypes with contrasting phenotypes can be selected for smaller yet more intensive experiments to understand phene-environment interactions in depth. Simulation modeling is used to further understand the phenotypes, and all stages of the pipeline feed back to ideotype and phenotyping platform development. In total, functional phenomics represents an evolution of pre-existing disciplines, but the goals and unique methodologies constitute a novel research program.
