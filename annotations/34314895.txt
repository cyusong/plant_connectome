An important question in biology is how organisms can associate with different microbes that pose no threat (commensals), pose a severe threat (pathogens), and those that are beneficial (symbionts). The root nodule symbiosis serves as an important model system for addressing such questions in the context of plant-microbe interactions. It is now generally accepted that rhizobia can actively suppress host immune responses during the infection process, analogous to the way in which plant pathogens can evade immune recognition. However, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms by which the host recognizes the rhizobia as pathogens and how, subsequently, these pathways are suppressed to allow establishment of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. In this study, we found that SymRK (Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase) is required for rhizobial suppression of plant innate immunity in Lotus japonicus. SymRK associates with LjBAK1 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-Associated receptor Kinase 1), a well-characterized positive regulator of plant innate immunity, and directly inhibits LjBAK1 kinase activity. Rhizobial inoculation enhances the association between SymRK and LjBAK1 in planta. LjBAK1 is required for the regulation of plant innate immunity and plays a negative role in rhizobial infection in L. japonicus. The data indicate that the SymRK-LjBAK1 protein complex serves as an intersection point between rhizobial symbiotic signaling pathways and innate immunity pathways, and support that rhizobia may actively suppress the host's ability to mount a defense response during the legume-rhizobium symbiosis.
