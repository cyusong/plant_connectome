Anticipating an increased ecological awareness, scientists have been exploring new strategies to reduce the use of chemical pesticides to control pests and diseases. Triggering the intrinsic plant defense system is one of the promising strategies to reduce yield loss by pathogenic organisms, such as nematodes. Ascorbate oxidase (AO) enzyme plays an important role in plant defense by regulating the apoplastic ascorbate/dehydroascorbate (DHA) ratio <i>via</i> the ascorbate oxidation process. Ascorbate oxidation is known to induce systemic resistance in rice against parasitic root-knot nematodes (RKN). Here, we sought to evaluate if AO- or DHA-induced resistance (IR) against RKN <i>M. graminicola</i> involves activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway and whether this IR phenotype has potential effects on growth of rice seedlings under stressed and unstressed conditions. Our results show that AO/DHA-IR against these parasitic nematodes is dependent on activation of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). However, application of reduced ascorbic acid (AA) did not induce this response. Gene expression analysis <i>via</i> qRT-PCR showed that <i>OsPAL2</i> and <i>OsPAL4</i> are highly expressed in AO/DHA-sprayed nematode-infected roots and PAL-activity measurements confirmed that AO/DHA spraying triggers the plants for primed activation of this enzyme upon nematode infection. AO/DHA-IR is not effective in plants sprayed with a chemical PAL inhibitor confirming that AO/DHA-induced resistance is dependent on PAL activity. Improved plant growth and low nematode infection in AO/DHA-sprayed plants was found to be correlated with an increase in shoot chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm), chlorophyll index (ChlIdx), and modified anthocyanin reflection index which were proven to be good above-ground parameters for nematode infestation. A detailed growth analysis confirmed the improved growth of AO/DHA-treated plants under nematode-infected conditions. Taken together, our results indicate that ascorbate oxidation enhances the phenylpropanoid-based response to nematode infection and leads to a tolerance phenotype in treated rice plants.
