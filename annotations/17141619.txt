['17141619', 'Seed dormancy is a key adaptive trait in plants responsible for the soil seed  bank. The long established hormone-balance theory describes the antagonistic  roles of the dormancy promoting plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), and the  germination promoting hormone gibberellin (GA) in dormancy control. Light,  temperature, and other dormancy-breaking signals function to modulate the  synthesis and perception of these hormones in the seed. However, the way in which  these hormones control dormancy in the imbibed seed remains unknown. Here, we  show that the DELLA protein regulators of the GA response are required for  dormancy and describe a model through which hormone signal integration and  dormancy regulation is achieved. We demonstrate that cotyledon expansion precedes  radicle emergence during Arabidopsis seed germination and that a striking  correlation exists between final seedling cotyledon size and seed dormancy in the  DELLA mutants. Furthermore, twelve previously characterized seed-dormancy mutants  are also defective in the control of cotyledon size in a manner consistent with  their effect on germination potential. We propose that DELLA-mediated, light-,  temperature-, and hormone-responsive cotyledon expansion prior to radicle  emergence overcomes dormancy imposed by the seed coat and underlies seed-dormancy  control in Arabidopsis.', '2006 Dec 5', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2006.10.057', 'Graham']
