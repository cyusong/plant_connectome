Salt stress hampers plant growth and development through both osmotic and ionic imbalances. One of the key players in modulating physiological responses towards salinity is the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). How plants cope with salinity largely depends on the magnitude of the soil salt content (stress severity), but also on age-related developmental processes (ontogeny). Here we studied how ABA directs salt stress responses in tomato plants for both mild and severe salt stress in leaves of different ages. We used the ABA-deficient mutant <i>notabilis</i>, which contains a null-mutation in the gene of a rate-limiting ABA biosynthesis enzyme 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED1), leading to impaired stomatal closure. We showed that both old and young leaves of <i>notabilis</i> plants keep a steady-state transpiration and photosynthesis rate during salt stress, probably due to their dysfunctional stomatal closure. At the whole plant level, transpiration declined similar to the wild-type, impacting final growth. <i>Notabilis</i> leaves were able to produce osmolytes and accumulate ions in a similar way as wild-type plants, but accumulated more proline, indicating that osmotic responses were not impaired by the <i>NCED1</i> mutation. Besides <i>NCED1</i>, also <i>NCED2</i> and <i>NCED6</i> are strongly upregulated under salt stress, which could explain why the <i>notabilis</i> mutant did not show a lower ABA content upon salt stress, except in young leaves. This might be indicative of a salt-mediated feedback mechanism on <i>NCED2/6</i> in <i>notabilis</i> and might explain why <i>notabilis</i> plants seem to perform better under salt stress compared to wild-type plants with respect to biomass and water content accumulation.

NCED1: !null-mutates! ABA biosynthesis enzyme
NCED2/6: !upregulates! under salt stress
ABA: !directs! salt stress responses
notabilis: !keeps steady-state! transpiration and photosynthesis rate
notabilis: !accumulates more! proline
notabilis: !performs better! under salt stress
