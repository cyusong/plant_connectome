['29401302', "Proteins that are to be eliminated must be proficiently recognized by proteolytic  systems so that inadvertent elimination of useful proteins is avoided. One  mechanism to ensure proper recognition is the presence of N-terminal degradation  signals (N-degrons) that are targeted by adaptor proteins (N-recognins). The  members of the caseinolytic protease S (ClpS) family of N-recognins identify  targets bearing an N-terminal phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan or leucine  residue, and then present them to a protease system. This process is known as the  'bacterial N-end rule'. The presence of a ClpS protein in Arabidopsis thaliana  chloroplasts (AtClpS1) prompted the hypothesis that the bacterial N-end rule  exists in this organelle. However, the specificity of AtClpS1 is unknown. Here we  show that AtClpS1 has the ability to recognize bacterial N-degrons, albeit with  low affinity. Recognition was assessed by the effect of purified AtClpS1 on the  degradation of fluorescent variants bearing bacterial N-degrons. In many  bacterial ClpS proteins, a methionine residue acts as a 'gatekeeper' residue,  fine-tuning the specificity of the N-recognin. In plants, the amino acid at that  position is an arginine. Replacement of this arginine for methionine in  recombinant AtClpS1 allows for high-affinity binding to classical N-degrons of  the bacterial N-end rule, suggesting that the arginine residue in the  substrate-binding site may also act as a gatekeeper for plant substrates.", '2018 Mar 1', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcy016', 'Ceccarelli']
