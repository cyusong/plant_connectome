['14627722', 'The position-dependent specification of the hair and non-hair cell types in the  Arabidopsis root epidermis provides a simple model for the study of cell fate  determination in plants. Several putative transcriptional regulators are known to  influence this cell fate decision. Indirect evidence from studies with the maize  R gene has been used to suggest that a bHLH transcription factor also  participates in this process. We show that two Arabidopsis genes encoding bHLH  proteins, GLABRA3 (GL3) and ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3), act in a partially  redundant manner to specify root epidermal cell fates. Plants homozygous for  mutations in both genes fail to specify the non-hair cell type, whereas plants  overexpressing either gene produce ectopic non-hair cells. We also find that  these genes are required for appropriate transcription of the non-hair  specification gene GL2 and the hair cell specification gene CPC, showing that GL3  and EGL3 influence both epidermal cell fates. Furthermore, we show that these  bHLH proteins require a functional WER MYB protein for their action, and they  physically interact with WER and CPC in the yeast two-hybrid assay. These results  suggest a model in which GL3 and EGL3 act together with WER in the N cell  position to promote the non-hair cell fate, whereas they interact with the  incomplete MYB protein CPC in the H position, which blocks the non-hair pathway  and leads to the hair cell fate.', '2003 Dec', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.00880', 'Schiefelbein']
