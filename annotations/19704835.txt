Endosperm is an interesting model for in vitro experiments, because of its unique origin, development and ploidy level. Here we used Actinidia deliciosa endosperm-derived callus to investigate morphology, histology and chemistry of extracellular matrix (ECM) structures in morphogenically stable tissue from long-term culture. SEM and TEM analysis showed that ECM is a heterogenous layer which consists of amorphous, dark-staining material, osmiophilic granules and reticulated fibres outside the outer callus cell wall. This structure may serve as a structural marker of morphogenic competence in endosperm-derived callus, because of its presence on the surface of callus forming morphogenic domains and its disappearance during organ growth. Based on immunolabelling, histochemistry, solvent and enzyme treatments, we suggest that pectins and lipids are components of the ECM layer. These results might indicate protective, water retention and/or cell communication functions for this ECM layer.
