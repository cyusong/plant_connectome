An Arabidopsis mutant displaying impaired stomatal responses to CO<sub>2</sub> , cdi4, was isolated by a leaf thermal imaging screening. The mutated gene PECT1 encodes CTP:phosphorylethanolamine (PE) cytidylyltransferase. The cdi4 exhibited a decrease in PE levels and a defect in light-induced stomatal opening as well as low CO<sub>2</sub> -induced stomatal opening. We created RNAi lines in which PECT1 was specifically repressed in guard cells. These lines are impaired in their stomatal responses to low CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light. Fungal toxin fusicoccin (FC) promotes stomatal opening by activating plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup> -ATPases in guard cells via phosphorylation. Arabidopsis H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase1 (AHA1) has been reported to be highly expressed in guard cells and its activation by FC induces stomatal opening. The cdi4 and PECT1 RNAi lines displayed a reduced stomatal opening response to FC. However, similar to in the wild type, cdi4 maintained normal levels of phosphorylation and activation of the stomatal H<sup>+</sup> -ATPases after FC treatment. Furthermore, the cdi4 displayed normal localization of GFP-AHA1 fusion protein and normal levels of AHA1 transcripts. Based on these results, we discuss how PECT1 could regulate CO<sub>2</sub> - and light-induced stomatal movements in guard cells in a manner that is independent and downstream of the activation of H<sup>+</sup> -ATPases.
