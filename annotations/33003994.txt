Agricultural yield is closely associated with nitrogen application. Thus, reducing the application of nitrogen without affecting agricultural production remains a challenging task. To understand the metabolic, physiological, and morphological response of wheat (Triticum aestivum) to nitrogen deficiency, it is crucial to identify the genes involved in the activated signaling pathways. We conducted a hydroponic experiment using a complete nutrient solution (N1) and a nutrient solution without nitrogen (N0). Wheat plants under nitrogen-deficient conditions (NDC) showed decreased crop height, leaf area, root volume, photosynthetic rate, crop weight, and increased root length, root surface area, root/shoot ratio. It indicates that nitrogen deficiency altered the phenotype of wheat plants. Furthermore, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the phenotype, transcriptome, GO pathways, and KEGG pathways of DEGs identified in wheat grown under NDC. It showed up-regulation of Exp (24), and Nrt (9) gene family members, which increased the nitrogen absorption and down-regulation of Pet (3), Psb (8), Nar (3), and Nir (1) gene family members hampered photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism. We identified 48 candidate genes that were involved in improved photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism in wheat plants grown under NDC. These genes may serve as molecular markers for genetic breeding of crops.
