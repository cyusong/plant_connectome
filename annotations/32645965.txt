<i>TaCKX</i>, <i>Triticum</i> <i>aestivum</i> (cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase) family genes influence the development of wheat plants by the specific regulation of cytokinin content in different organs. However, their detailed role is not known. The <i>TaCKX1</i>, highly and specifically expressed in developing spikes and in seedling roots, was silenced by RNAi-mediated gene silencing via <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> and the effect of silencing was investigated in 7 DAP (days after pollination) spikes of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> generations. Various levels of <i>TaCKX1</i> silencing in both generations influence different models of co-expression with other <i>TaCKX</i> genes and parameters of yield-related traits. Only a high level of silencing in T<sub>2</sub> resulted in strong down-regulation of <i>TaCKX11 (3)</i>, up-regulation of <i>TaCKX2.1</i>, <i>2.2</i>, <i>5,</i> and <i>9</i> (<i>10</i>), and a high yielding phenotype. This phenotype is characterized by a higher spike number, grain number, and grain yield, but lower thousand grain weight (TGW). The content of most of cytokinin forms in 7 DAP spikes of silenced T<sub>2</sub> lines increased from 23% to 76% compared to the non-silenced control. The CKs cross talk with other phytohormones. Each of the tested yield-related traits is regulated by various up- or down-regulated <i>TaCKX</i> genes and phytohormones. The coordinated effect of <i>TaCKX1</i> silencing on the expression of other <i>TaCKX</i> genes, phytohormone levels in 7 DAP spikes, and yield-related traits in silenced T<sub>2</sub> lines is presented.
