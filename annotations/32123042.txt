Jasmonate-induced protein 60 (JIP60) is a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) from barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and is involved in the plant immune response dependent on jasmonate hormones. Here, we demonstrate in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> that transient expression of the N-terminal domain of JIP60, from which the inhibitor domain (amino acids 163-185) is removed, initiates cell death, leading to extensive necrosis of leaf tissues. We used structure prediction of JIP60 to identify potential catalytic amino acids in the active site and tested these by mutagenesis and in planta assays of necrosis induction by expression in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, as well as through an in vitro translation-inactivation assay. We found that Tyr 96, Glu 201, Arg 204, and Trp 234 in the presumptive active site of JIP60 are conserved in 815 plant RIPs in the Pfam database that were identified by HUMMR as containing a RIP domain. When these amino acid residues are individually mutated, the necrosis-inducing activity is completely abolished. We therefore propose that the role of these amino acids in JIP60 activity is to depurinate adenosine in ribosomes. This study provides insight into the catalytic mechanism of JIP60.
