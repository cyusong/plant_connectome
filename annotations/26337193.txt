Phytochrome system perceives the reduction in the ratio of red to far-red light when plants are grown under dense canopy. This signal, regarded as a warning of competition, will trigger a series of phenotypic changes to avoid shade. Progress has been made for several phytochrome signaling intermediates acting as positive regulators of accelerated elongation growth and promotion of flowering in shade-avoidance has been identified. Recently, a FPF1 homolog GhFPF1 was identified in upland cotton. Our data supported that transgenic Arabidopsis of over-expressing GhFPF1 displayed a constitutive shade-avoiding phenotype resembling phyB mutants in several respects such as accelerated elongation of hypocotyl and petioles, upward of leaf movement, and promoted flowering. In this addendum, by dissection of GhFPF1 acting as a component of shade-avoidance responses we suppose that GhFPF1 might influence the timing of the floral transition independently of shade-mediated early flowering. Furthermore, the opposite changes of IAA content in transgenic leaves and stems suggested that alteration of IAA storage and release took place during shade-avoidance responses.
