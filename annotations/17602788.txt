Parasitic powdery mildew fungi have to overcome basic resistance and manipulate host cells to establish a haustorium as a functional feeding organ in a host epidermal cell. Currently, it is of central interest how plant factors negatively regulate basal defense or whether they even support fungal development in compatible interactions. Additionally, creation of a metabolic sink in infected cells may involve host activity. Here, we review the current progress in understanding potential fungal targets for host reprogramming and nutrient acquisition.
