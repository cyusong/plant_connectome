['22615140', 'The phytohormone ethylene plays important roles in regulating plant responses to  phosphate (Pi) starvation. To date, however, no molecular components have been  identified that interact with ethylene signalling in regulating such responses.  In this work, an Arabidopsis mutant, hps4, was characterized that exhibits  enhanced responses to Pi starvation, including increased inhibition of primary  root growth, enhanced expression of Pi starvation-induced genes, and  overproduction of root-associated acid phosphatases. Molecular cloning indicated  that hps4 is a new allele of SABRE, which was previously identified as an  important regulator of cell expansion in Arabidopsis. HPS4/SABRE antagonistically  interacts with ethylene signalling to regulate plant responses to Pi starvation.  Furthermore, it is shown that Pi-starved hps4 mutants accumulate more auxin in  their root tips than the wild type, which may explain the increased inhibition of  their primary root growth when grown under Pi deficiency.', '2012 Jul', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ers131', 'Liu']
