['12172027', 'The Arabidopsis phloem channel AKT3 is the founder of a subfamily of shaker-like  plant potassium channels characterized by weak rectification, Ca(2+) block,  proton inhibition, and, as shown in this study, K(+) sensitivity. In contrast to  inward-rectifying, acid-activated K(+) channels of the KAT1 family, extracellular  acidification decreases AKT3 currents at the macroscopic and single-channel  levels. Here, we show that two distinct sites within the outer mouth of the  K(+)-conducting pore provide the molecular basis for the pH sensitivity of this  phloem channel. After generation of mutant channels and functional expression in  Xenopus oocytes, we identified the His residue His-228, which is proximal to the  K(+) selectivity filter (GYGD) and the distal Ser residue Ser-271, to be involved  in proton susceptibility. Mutations of these sites, H228D and S271E, drastically  reduced the H(+) and K(+) sensitivity of AKT3. Although in K(+)-free bath  solutions outward K(+) currents were abolished completely in wild-type AKT3,  S271E as well as the AKT3-HDSE double mutant still mediated K(+) efflux. We  conclude that the pH- and K(+)-dependent properties of the AKT3 channel involve  residues in the outer mouth of the pore. Both properties, H(+) and K(+)  sensitivity, allow the fine-tuning of the phloem channel and thus seem to  represent important elements in the control of membrane potential and sugar  loading.', '2002 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.003244', 'Hedrich']
