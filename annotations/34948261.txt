The chloroplast has a central position in oxygenic photosynthesis and primary metabolism. In addition to these functions, the chloroplast has recently emerged as a pivotal regulator of plant responses to abiotic and biotic stress conditions. Chloroplasts have their own independent genomes and gene-expression machinery and synthesize phytohormones and a diverse range of secondary metabolites, a significant portion of which contribute the plant response to adverse conditions. Furthermore, chloroplasts communicate with the nucleus through retrograde signaling, for instance, reactive oxygen signaling. All of the above facilitate the chloroplast's exquisite flexibility in responding to environmental stresses. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the involvement of chloroplasts in plant regulatory responses to various abiotic and biotic stresses including heat, chilling, salinity, drought, high light environmental stress conditions, and pathogen invasions. This review will enrich the better understanding of interactions between chloroplast and environmental stresses, and will lay the foundation for genetically enhancing plant-stress acclimatization.
