Nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as an essential biological messenger in plant biology that usually transmits its bioactivity by post-translational modifications such as S-nitrosylation, the reversible addition of an NO group to a protein cysteine residue leading to S-nitrosothiols (SNOs). In recent years, SNOs have risen as key signalling molecules mainly involved in plant response to stress. Chief among SNOs is S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), generated by S-nitrosylation of the key antioxidant glutathione (GSH). GSNO is considered the major NO reservoir and a phloem mobile signal that confers to NO the capacity to be a long-distance signalling molecule. GSNO is able to regulate protein function and gene expression, resulting in a key role for GSNO in fundamental processes in plants, such as development and response to a wide range of environmental stresses. In addition, GSNO is also able to regulate the total SNO pool and, consequently, it could be considered the storage of NO in cells that may control NO signalling under basal and stress-related responses. Thus, GSNO function could be crucial during plant response to environmental stresses. Besides the importance of GSNO in plant biology, its mode of action has not been widely discussed in the literature. In this review, we will first discuss the GSNO turnover in cells and secondly the role of GSNO as a mediator of physiological and stress-related processes in plants, highlighting those aspects for which there is still some controversy.
