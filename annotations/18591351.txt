['18591351', 'Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including  nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope  (NE) reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical  to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the NE and is associated  with the outer surface of the NE in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis  thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip NE requires a family of likely  plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains  (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs). We have now identified, by  tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry, a second family of  CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family,  that is required for RanGAP NE association in root tip cells. A combination of  loss-of-function mutant analysis and protein interaction data indicates that at  least one member of each NE-associated CC-TMD protein family is required for  RanGAP targeting in root tip cells, while both families are dispensable in other  plant tissues. This suggests an unanticipated complexity of RanGAP NE targeting  in higher plant cells, contrasting both the single nucleoporin anchor in  metazoans and the lack of targeting in fungi and proposes an early evolutionary  divergence of the underlying plant and animal mechanisms.', '2008 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.059220', 'Meier']
