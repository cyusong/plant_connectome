Parasitic plants extract nutrients from the other plants to finish their life cycle and reproduce. The control of parasitic weeds is notoriously difficult due to their tight physical association and their close biological relationship to their hosts. Parasitic plants differ in their susceptible host ranges, and the host species differ in their susceptibility to parasitic plants. Current data show that adaptations of parasitic plants to various hosts are largely genetically determined. However, multiple cases of rapid adaptation in genetically homogenous parasitic weed populations to new hosts strongly suggest the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. Recent progress in genome-wide analyses of gene expression and epigenetic features revealed many new molecular details of the parasitic plants' interactions with their host plants. The experimental data obtained in the last several years show that multiple common features have independently evolved in different lines of the parasitic plants. In this review we discuss the most interesting new details in the interaction between parasitic and host plants.
