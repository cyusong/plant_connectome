['19622803', 'The development and activity of the procambium and cambium, which ensure vascular  tissue formation, is critical for overall plant architecture and growth. However,  little is known about the molecular factors affecting the activity of vascular  meristems and vascular tissue formation. Here, we show that the His kinase  CYTOKININ-INDEPENDENT1 (CKI1) and the cytokinin receptors ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE  KINASE2 (AHK2) and AHK3 are important regulators of vascular tissue development  in Arabidopsis thaliana shoots. Genetic modifications of CKI1 activity in  Arabidopsis cause dysfunction of the two-component signaling pathway and defects  in procambial cell maintenance. CKI1 overexpression in protoplasts leads to  cytokinin-independent activation of the two-component phosphorelay, and  intracellular domains are responsible for the cytokinin-independent activity of  CKI1. CKI1 expression is observed in vascular tissues of inflorescence stems, and  CKI1 forms homodimers both in vitro and in planta. Loss-of-function ahk2 and ahk3  mutants and plants with reduced levels of endogenous cytokinins show defects in  procambium proliferation and an absence of secondary growth. CKI1 overexpression  partially rescues ahk2 ahk3 phenotypes in vascular tissue, while the negative  mutation CKI1H405Q further accentuates mutant phenotypes. These results indicate  that the cytokinin-independent activity of CKI1 and cytokinin-induced AHK2 and  AHK3 are important for vascular bundle formation in Arabidopsis.', '2009 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.066696', 'Hwang']
