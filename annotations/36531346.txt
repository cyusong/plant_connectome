Lodging reduces grain yield in cereal crops. The height, diameter and strength of stem are crucial for lodging resistance, grain yield, and photosynthate transport in barley. Understanding the genetic basis of stem benefits barley breeding. Here, we evaluated 13 stem related traits after 28 days of heading in a barley DH population in two consecutive years. Significant phenotypic correlations between lodging index (LI) and other stem traits were observed. Three mapping methods using the experimental data and the BLUP data, detected 27 stable and major QTLs, and 22 QTL clustered regions. Many QTLs were consistent with previously reported traits for grain filling rate, internodes, panicle and lodging resistance. Further, candidate genes were predicted for stable and major QTLs and were associated with plant development and adverse stress in the transition from vegetative stage to reproductive stage. This study provided potential genetic basis and new information for exploring barley stem morphology, and laid a foundation for map-based cloning and further fine mapping of these QTLs.
