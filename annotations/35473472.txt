Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is the causal agent of pine wilt disease (PWD) that has caused enormous ecological and economic losses in China. The mechanism in the interaction between nematodes and pine remains unclear. Plant parasitic nematodes (PPNs) secrete effectors into host plant tissues. However, it is poorly studied that role of effector in the infection of pine wood nematode (PWN). We cloned, characterized and functionally validated the B. xylophilus effector BxML1, containing an MD-2-related lipid-recognition (ML) domain. This protein inhibits immune responses triggered by the molecular pattern BxCDP1 of B. xylophilus. An insitu hybridization assay demonstrated that BxML1 was expressed mainly in the dorsal glands and intestine of B. xylophilus. Subcellular localization analysis showed the presence of BxML1 in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, number of B. xylophilus and morbidity of pine were significantly reduced in Pinus thunbergii infected with B. xylophilus when BxML was silenced. Using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) assays, we found that the BxML1 interacts with cyclophilin protein PtCyP1 in P. thunbergii. This study illustrated that BxML1 plays a critical role in the B. xylophilus-plant interaction and virulence of B. xylophilus.
