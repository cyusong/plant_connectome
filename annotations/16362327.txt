We report here on the identification and characterization of ZmLrk-1, a member of the Lrk class of receptor-like kinases in Zea mays. This gene was found to be located at the bin21.40 region on the short arm of maize chromosome 8, closely linked to the previously reported pseudogene of the same class psiZmLrk (originally called Zm2Lrk). Transient expression experiments in onion epithelium cells, using a ZmLrk-1:GFP fusion protein, indicate that ZmLrk-1 is a membrane protein. ZmLrk-1 is ubiquitously expressed in the maize plant, including roots and aerial parts. In seeds, ZmLrk-1 transcripts can be detected by in situ hybridization exclusively at the basal endosperm transfer cell layer during the first stages of development. However, from 14 days after pollination its transcripts are preferentially detected at the upper half of the kernel, including both the aleurone and the starchy endosperm. ZmLrk-1 expression is not induced after treatment with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid or wounding, but it clearly increases after infection of germinating seeds with Fusarium oxysporum. This suggests that ZmLrk-1 could be involved in a sensing system to activate plant defence mechanisms against fungal attacks during endosperm development and seed germination.
