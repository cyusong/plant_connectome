Changes in gene regulation during differentiation are governed by networks of transcription factors. The Arabidopsis root endodermis is a tractable model to address how transcription factors contribute to differentiation. We used a bottom-up approach to understand the extent to which transcription factors that are required for endodermis differentiation can confer endodermis identity to a non-native cell type. Our results show that the transcription factors SHORTROOT and MYB36 alone have limited ability to induce ectopic endodermal features in the absence of additional cues. The stele-derived signalling peptide CIF2 stabilizes SHORTROOT-induced endodermis identity acquisition. The outcome is a partially impermeable barrier deposited in the subepidermal cell layer, which has a transcriptional signature similar to the endodermis. These results demonstrate that other root cell types can be forced to differentiate into the endodermis and highlight a previously unappreciated role for receptor kinase signalling in maintaining endodermis identity.

CIF2: !stabilizes! SHORTROOT-induced endodermis identity
Receptor kinase signalling: !maintains! endodermis identity
