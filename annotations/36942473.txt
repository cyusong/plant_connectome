Pumpkin is often used as a rootstock for other Cucurbitaceae crops due to its resistance to soil-borne diseases and abiotic stress. Pumpkin rootstocks use a sodium transporter (CmHKT1;1) to promote the transport of Na<sup>+</sup> from the shoot to the root effectively and improve the salt tolerance of the scion. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms that influence the activity of CmHKT1;1 during salt stress response remain unknown. In this study, CmCNIH1, a cornichon homolog, was identified as a potential cargo receptor for CmHKT1;1. Yeast two-hybrid, biomolecular fluorescence complementation, and luciferase complementary assays demonstrated that CmCNIH1 and CmHKT1;1 could interact. CmCNIH1 was a key component of the cellular vesicle transport machinery located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER export site (ERES), and Golgi apparatus. A CmCNIH1 knockout mutant was more sensitive to salt stress than the wild type (WT). In addition, ion homeostasis was disrupted in cmcnih1 mutants, which had higher Na<sup>+</sup> and lower K<sup>+</sup> content in shoots and roots than the WT. Two-electrode voltage-clamp experiment displayed that CmCNIH1 could not influence the Na<sup>+</sup> current that passed through the plasma membrane (PM) in CmHKT1;1-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes. Data from colocalization assays indicated that intact CmCNIH1 protein could alter the subcellular localization of CmHKT1;1 in tobacco leaf, pumpkin root, and yeast. In summary, CmCNIH1 may function as a cargo receptor that regulates the localization of CmHKT1;1 to the PM to improve salt tolerance in pumpkin.
