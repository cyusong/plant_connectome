Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity in plants is generally associated with glycolytic fermentation, which facilitates cell survival during episodes of low-oxygen stress in water-logged roots as well as chronically hypoxic regions surrounding the vascular core. Work with tobacco and potato has implicated ADH activity in additional metabolic roles, including aerobic fermentation, acetaldehyde detoxification and carbon reutilization. Here a combination of approaches has been used to examine tissue-specific patterns of Adh gene expression in order to provide insight into the potential roles of alcohol dehydrogenases, using Petunia hybrida, a solanaceous species with well-characterized genetics. A reporter-gene study, relying on the promoters of Adh1 and Adh2 to drive expression of the gene for a green fluorescent protein derivative, mgfp5, revealed unexpectedly complex patterns of GFP fluorescence in floral tissues, particularly the stigma, style and nectary. Results of GC-MS analysis suggest the association of ADH with production of aromatic compounds in the nectary. Overall the results demonstrate selective recruitment of Adh gene family members in tissues and organs associated with diverse ADH functions.
