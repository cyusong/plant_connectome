The role of Sly-miR171d on tomato fruit chilling injury (CI) was investigated. The results showed that silencing the endogenous Sly-miR171d effectively delayed the increase of CI and electrolyte leakage (EL) in tomato fruit, and maintained fruit firmness and quality. After low temperature storage, the expression of target gene <i>GRAS24</i> increased in STTM-miR171d tomato fruit, the level of GA<sub>3</sub> anabolism and the expression of <i>CBF1</i>, an important regulator of cold resistance, both increased in STTM-miR171d tomato fruit, indicated that silencing the Sly-miR171d can improve the resistance ability of postharvest tomato fruit to chilling tolerance.
