['24907342', 'In addition to acting as photoprotective compounds, carotenoids also serve as  precursors in the biosynthesis of several phytohormones and proposed regulatory  signals. Here, we report a signaling process derived from carotenoids that  regulates early chloroplast and leaf development. Biosynthesis of the signal  depends on zeta-carotene desaturase activity encoded by the zeta-CAROTENE DESATURASE  (ZDS)/CHLOROPLAST BIOGENESIS5 (CLB5) gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. Unlike other  carotenoid-deficient plants, zds/clb5 mutant alleles display profound alterations  in leaf morphology and cellular differentiation as well as altered expression of  many plastid- and nucleus-encoded genes. The leaf developmental phenotypes and  gene expression alterations of zds/clb5/spc1/pde181 plants are rescued by  inhibitors or mutations of phytoene desaturase, demonstrating that phytofluene  and/or zeta-carotene are substrates for an unidentified signaling molecule. Our work  further demonstrates that this signal is an apocarotenoid whose synthesis  requires the activity of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase CCD4.', '2014 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.123349', 'Leon']
