['23453954', 'Stomata are highly specialized organs that consist of pairs of guard cells and  regulate gas and water vapor exchange in plants [1-3]. Although early stages of  guard cell differentiation have been described [4-10] and were interpreted in  analogy to processes of cell type differentiation in animals [11], the downstream  development of functional stomatal guard cells remains poorly understood. We have  isolated an Arabidopsis mutant, stomatal carpenter 1 (scap1), that develops  irregularly shaped guard cells and lacks the ability to control stomatal  aperture, including CO2-induced stomatal closing and light-induced stomatal  opening. SCAP1 was identified as a plant-specific Dof-type transcription factor  expressed in maturing guard cells, but not in guard mother cells. SCAP1 regulates  the expression of genes encoding key elements of stomatal functioning and  morphogenesis, such as K(+) channel protein, MYB60 transcription factor, and  pectin methylesterase. Consequently, ion homeostasis was disturbed in scap1 guard  cells, and esterification of extracellular pectins was impaired so that the cell  walls lining the pores did not mature normally. We conclude that SCAP1 regulates  essential processes of stomatal guard cell maturation and functions as a key  transcription factor regulating the final stages of guard cell differentiation.', '2013 Mar 18', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2013.02.001', 'Iba']
