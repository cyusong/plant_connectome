We describe a boron (B) transporter, Os BOR1, in rice (Oryza sativa). Os BOR1 is a plasma membrane-localized efflux transporter of B and is required for normal growth of rice plants under conditions of limited B supply (referred to as -B). Disruption of Os BOR1 reduced B uptake and xylem loading of B. The accumulation of Os BOR1 transcripts was higher in roots than that in shoots and was not affected by B deprivation; however, Os BOR1 was detected in the roots of wild-type plants under -B conditions, but not under normal conditions, suggesting regulation of protein accumulation in response to B nutrition. Interestingly, tissue specificity of Os BOR1 expression is affected by B treatment. Transgenic rice plants containing an Os BOR1 promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion construct grown with a normal B supply showed the strongest GUS activity in the steles, whereas after 3 d of -B treatment, GUS activity was elevated in the exodermis. After 6 d of -B treatment, GUS activity was again strong in the stele. Our results demonstrate that Os BOR1 is required both for efficient B uptake and for xylem loading of B. Possible roles of the temporal changes in tissue-specific patterns of Os BOR1 expression in response to B condition are discussed.
