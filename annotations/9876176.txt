['9876176', 'Several lines of evidence indicate that the adaxial leaf domain possesses a  unique competence to form shoot apical meristems. Factors required for this  competence are expected to cause a defect in shoot apical meristem formation when  inactivated and to be expressed or active preferentially in the adaxial leaf  domain. PINHEAD, a member of a family of proteins that includes the translation  factor eIF2C, is required for reliable formation of primary and axillary shoot  apical meristems. In addition to high-level expression in the vasculature, we  find that low-level PINHEAD expression defines a novel domain of positional  identity in the plant. This domain consists of adaxial leaf primordia and the  meristem. These findings suggest that the PINHEAD gene product may be a component  of a hypothetical meristem forming competence factor. We also describe defects in  floral organ number and shape, as well as aberrant embryo and ovule development  associated with pinhead mutants, thus elaborating on the role of PINHEAD in  Arabidopsis development. In addition, we find that embryos doubly mutant for  PINHEAD and ARGONAUTE1, a related, ubiquitously expressed family member, fail to  progress to bilateral symmetry and do not accumulate the SHOOT MERISTEMLESS  protein. Therefore PINHEAD and ARGONAUTE1 together act to allow wild-type growth  and gene expression patterns during embryogenesis.', '1999 Feb', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.126.3.469', 'Barton']
