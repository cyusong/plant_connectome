['21359673', 'The ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA) proteins are  widespread in living organisms. Some of the AAA-type ATPases possess  metalloprotease activities. Other members constitute the 26S proteasome  complexes. In recent years, a few AAA members have been implicated in  vesicle-mediated secretion, membrane fusion, cellular organelle biogenesis, and  hypersensitive responses (HR) in plants. However, the physiological roles and  biochemical activities of plant AAA proteins have not yet been defined at the  molecular level, and regulatory mechanisms underlying their functions are largely  unknown. In this study, we showed that overexpression of an Arabidopsis gene  encoding a mitochondrial AAA protein, ATPase-in-Seed-Development (ASD), induces  morphological and anatomical defects in seed maturation. The ASD gene is  expressed at a high level during the seed maturation process and in mature seeds  but is repressed rapidly in germinating seeds. Transgenic plants overexpressing  the ASD gene are morphologically normal. However, seed formation is severely  disrupted in the transgenic plants. The ASD gene is induced by abiotic stresses,  such as low temperatures and high salinity, in an abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent  manner. The ASD protein possesses ATPase activity and is localized into the  mitochondria. Our observations suggest that ASD may play a role in seed  maturation by influencing mitochondrial function under abiotic stress.', '2011 Apr', 'Mol Cells', '10.1007/s10059-011-0048-0', 'Park']
