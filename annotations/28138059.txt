['28138059', 'Enhancement of root hair development in response to phosphate (Pi) deficit has  been reported extensively. Root hairs are involved in major root functions such  as the absorption of water, acquisition of nutrients and secretion of organic  acids and enzymes. Individual root hair cells maintain these functions and  appropriate structure under various physiological conditions. We carried out a  study to identify protein(s) which maintain the structure and function of root  hairs, and identified a protein (SEED AND ROOT HAIR PROTECTIVE PROTEIN, SRPP)  that was induced in root hairs under Pi-deficient conditions. Promoter assay and  mRNA quantification revealed that SRPP was expressed in root hairs and seeds. A  knockout mutant, srpp-1, consistently displayed defects in root hairs and seeds.  Root hairs in srpp-1 were short and the phenotypes observed under Pi-deficient  conditions were also detected in ethylene-treated srpp-1 plants. Propidium iodide  stained most root hairs of srpp-1 grown under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting  cell death. In addition to root hairs, most srpp-1 seeds were withered and their  embryos were dead. SRPP tagged with green fluorescent protein was detected in the  cell wall. Electron microscopy showed abnormal morphology of the cell wall.  Wild-type phenotypes were restored when the SRPP gene was expressed in srpp-1.  These data strongly suggest that SRPP contributes to the construction of robust  cell walls, whereby it plays a key role in the development of root hairs and  seeds.', '2017 Apr 1', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcx008', 'Maeshima']
