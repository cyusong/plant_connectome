MADS-domain transcription factors have been identified as key regulators involved in proper flower and fruit development in angiosperms. As members of the MADS-box subfamily, B<sub>sister</sub> (B<sub>s</sub>) genes have been observed to play an important role during the evolution of the reproductive organs in seed plants. However, their effects on reproductive development in fruit crops, such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), remain unclear. Here, we found that SlMBP22 overexpression (SlMBP22-OE) resulted in considerable alterations in floral morphology and affected the expression levels of several floral homeotic genes. Further analysis by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays demonstrated that SlMBP22 forms dimers with class A protein MACROCALYX (MC) and SEPALLATA (SEP) floral homeotic proteins TM5 and TM29, respectively. In addition, pollen viability and cross-fertilization assays suggested that the defect in female reproductive development was responsible for the infertility phenotype observed in the strong overexpression transgenic plants. Transgenic fruits with mild overexpression exhibited reduced size as a result of reduced cell expansion, rather than impaired cell division. Additionally, SlMBP22 overexpression in tomato not only affected proanthocyanidin (PA) accumulation but also altered seed dormancy. Taken together, these findings may provide new insights into the knowledge of B<sub>s</sub> MADS-box genes in flower and fruit development in tomato.
