['10861228', 'Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is the primary regulator of flux through the  mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Although PDKs inactivate  mitochondrial PDC by phosphorylating specific Ser residues, the primary amino  acid sequence indicates that they are more closely related to prokaryotic His  kinases than to eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinases. Unlike Ser/Thr kinases, His kinases  use a conserved His residue for phosphotransfer to Asp residues. To understand  these unique kinases better, a presumptive PDK from Arabidopsis thaliana was  heterologously expressed and purified for this investigation. Purified,  recombinant A. thaliana PDK could inactivate kinase-depleted maize mitochondrial  PDC by phosphorylating Ser residues. Additionally, A. thaliana PDK was capable of  autophosphorylating Ser residues near its N-terminus, although this reaction is  not part of the phosphotransfer pathway. To elucidate the mechanism involved, we  performed site-directed mutagenesis of the canonical His residue likely to be  involved in phosphotransfer. When His-121 was mutated to Ala or Gln,  Ser-autophosphorylation was decreased by 50% and transphosphorylation of PDC was  decreased concomitantly. We postulate that either (1) His-121 is not the sole  phosphotransfer His residue or (2) mutagenesis of His-121 exposes an additional  otherwise cryptic phosphotransfer His residue. Thus His-121 is one residue  involved in kinase function.', '2000 Jul 1', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/0264-6021:3490195', 'Randall']
