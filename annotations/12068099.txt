['12068099', 'Branched-chain amino acid transaminases (BCATs) play a crucial role in the  metabolism of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. They catalyze the last step of the  synthesis and/or the initial step of the degradation of this class of amino  acids. In Arabidopsis, seven putative BCAT genes are identified by their  similarity to their counterparts from other organisms. We have now cloned the  respective cDNA sequences of six of these genes. The deduced amino acid sequences  show between 47.5% and 84.1% identity to each other and about 30% to the  homologous enzymes from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammals. In  addition, many amino acids in crucial positions as determined by crystallographic  analyses of BCATs from Escherichia coli and human (Homo sapiens) are conserved in  the AtBCATs. Complementation of a yeast Deltabat1/Deltabat2 double knockout  strain revealed that five AtBCATs can function as BCATs in vivo. Transient  expression of BCAT:green fluorescent protein fusion proteins in tobacco  (Nicotiana tabacum) protoplasts shows that three isoenzymes are imported into  chloroplasts (AtBCAT-2, -3, and -5), whereas a single enzyme is directed into  mitochondria (AtBCAT-1).', '2002 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.001602', 'Binder']
