Nectar is one of the key rewards mediating plant-mutualist interactions. In addition to sugars, nectars often contain many other compounds with important biological functions, including proteins. This study was undertaken to assess the proteinaceous content of Brassica rapa nectar. SDS-PAGE analysis of raw B. rapa nectar revealed the presence of ~10 proteins, with a major band at ~10 kDa. This major band was found to contain a non-specific lipid transfer protein encoded by B. rapa locus Bra028980 and subsequently termed BrLTP2.1. Sequence analysis of BrLTP2.1 predicted the presence of a signal peptide required for secretion from the cell, eight cysteines, and a mature molecular mass of 7.3 kDa. Constitutively expressed BrLTP2.1-GFP in Arabidopsis displayed accumulation patterns consistent with secretion from nectary cells. BrLTP2.1 was also found to have relatively high sequence similarity to non-specific lipid-transfer proteins with known functions in plant defense, including Arabidopsis DIR1. Heterologously expressed and purified BrLTP2.1 was extremely heat stable and bound strongly to saturated free fatty acids, but not methyl jasmonate. Recombinant BrLTP2.1 also had direct antimicrobial activity against an extensive range of plant pathogens, being particularly effective against necrotrophic fungi. Taken together, these results suggest that BrLTP2.1 may function to prevent microbial growth in nectars.
