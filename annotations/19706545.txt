Plants accumulate free L-proline (Pro) in response to abiotic stresses (drought and salinity) and presence of bacterial pathogens, including the tumor-inducing bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. However, the function of Pro accumulation in host-pathogen interaction is still unclear. Here, we demonstrated that Pro antagonizes plant GABA-defense in the A. tumefaciens C58-induced tumor by interfering with the import of GABA and consequently the GABA-induced degradation of the bacterial quorum-sensing signal, 3-oxo-octanoylhomoserine lactone. We identified a bacterial receptor Atu2422, which is implicated in the uptake of GABA and Pro, suggesting that Pro acts as a natural antagonist of GABA-signaling. The Atu2422 amino acid sequence contains a Venus flytrap domain that is required for trapping GABA in human GABA(B) receptors. A constructed atu2422 mutant was more virulent than the wild type bacterium; moreover, transgenic plants with a low level of Pro exhibited less severe tumor symptoms than did their wild-type parents, revealing a crucial role for Venus flytrap GABA-receptor and relative abundance of GABA and Pro in host-pathogen interaction.
