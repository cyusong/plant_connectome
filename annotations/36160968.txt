Euryale (<i>Euryale ferox</i> Salisb.) is an aquatic crop used as both food and drug in Asia, but its utilization is seriously limited due to low yield. Previously, we hypothesized that <i>Euryale small auxin up RNA</i>s (<i>EuSAUR</i>s) regulate seed size, but the underlying biological functions and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we observed that the hybrid Euryale lines (HL) generate larger seeds with higher indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentrations than those in the North Gordon Euryale (WT). Histological analysis suggested that a larger ovary in HL is attributed to longer cells around. Overexpression of <i>EuSAUR62</i> in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) resulted in larger glumes and grains and increased the length of glume cells. Immunofluorescence and protein interaction assays revealed that <i>EuSAUR62</i> modulates IAA accumulation around the rice ovary by interacting with the rice PIN-FORMED 9, an auxin efflux carrier protein. Euryale basic region/leucine zipper 55 (EubZIP55), which was highly expressed in HL, directly binds to the <i>EuSAUR62</i> promoter and activated the expression of <i>EuSAUR62</i>. Constant light increased the expression of both <i>EubZIP55</i> and <i>EuSAUR62</i> with auxin-mediated hook curvature in HL seedlings. Overall, we proposed that <i>EuSAUR62</i> is a molecular bridge between light and IAA and plays a crucial role in regulating the size of the Euryale seed.
