Climate change hampers food safety and food security. Crop breeding has been boosting superior quantity traits such as yield, but roots have often been overlooked in spite of their role in the whole plant physiology. New evidence is emerging on the relevance of root system architecture in coping with the environment. Here, we review determinants of root system architecture, mainly based on studies on Arabidopsis, and we discuss how breeding for appropriate root architecture may help obtain plants that are better adapted or resilient to abiotic and biotic stresses, more productive, and more efficient for soil and water use. We also highlight recent advances in phenotyping high-tech platforms and genotyping techniques that may further help to understand the mechanisms of root development and how roots control relationships between plants and soil. An integrated approach is proposed that combines phenotyping and genotyping information via bioinformatic analyses and reveals genetic control of root system architecture, paving the way for future research on plant breeding.
