['28739644', 'Potassium and nitrogen are essential macronutrients for plant growth and have a  positive impact on crop yield. Previous studies have indicated that the  absorption and translocation of K(+) and NO(3)(-) are correlated with each other  in plants; however, the molecular mechanism that coordinates K(+) and NO(3)(-)  transport remains unknown. In this study, using a forward genetic approach, we  isolated a low-K(+)-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, lks2, that showed a  leaf chlorosis phenotype under low-K(+) conditions. LKS2 encodes the transporter  NRT1.5/NPF7.3, a member of the NRT1/PTR (Nitrate Transporter 1/Peptide  Transporter) family. The lks2/nrt1.5 mutants exhibit a remarkable defect in both  K(+) and NO(3)(-) translocation from root to shoot, especially under low-K(+)  conditions. This study demonstrates that LKS2 (NRT1.5) functions as a  proton-coupled H(+)/K(+) antiporter. Proton gradient can promote NRT1.5-mediated  K(+) release out of root parenchyma cells and facilitate K(+) loading into the  xylem. This study reveals that NRT1.5 plays a crucial role in K(+) translocation  from root to shoot and is also involved in the coordination of K(+)/NO(3)(-)  distribution in plants.', '2017 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00972', 'ORCID:']
