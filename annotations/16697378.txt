RPLKPW is a potent anti-hypertensive peptide designed according to the structure of ovokinin(2-7) (RADHPF). In this study, we generated transgenic rice plants that accumulate the RPLKPW peptide as a fusion protein with the rice storage protein glutelin. The engineered peptide is expressed under the control of endosperm-specific glutelin promoters and specifically accumulates in seeds. Oral administration of either the RPLKPW-glutelin fraction or transgenic rice seeds to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) significantly reduced systolic blood pressures. These results suggest the possible application of transgenic rice seed as a nutraceutical delivery system and specifically for administration of active peptides in hypertension.
