['35929083', 'The complexes translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts and  translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts (TIC) mediate  preprotein translocation across the chloroplast outer and inner envelope  membranes, respectively. Tic20, Tic56, Tic100, and Tic214 form a stable  one-megadalton TIC whose function is essential for Arabidopsis thaliana and  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Tic20 plays a central role in preprotein translocation  by forming a protein-conducting channel. Tic56, Tic100, and Tic214 are also  indispensable for TIC function, but whether other components are required for  this process remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a 12-kDa protein named  Tic12 is part of the TIC in A. thaliana and participates in preprotein  translocation across the inner envelope membrane. Tic12 was tightly associated  with the TIC but disassociated under high-salt conditions in combination with  Triton X-100. Site-specific UV crosslinking experiments revealed that Tic12 and  Tic20 directly interact with the transit peptide of a translocating preprotein.  The tic12 null mutants are albino and seedling lethal, similar to the other tic  null mutants. Tic12 and Tic20 were also involved in preprotein translocation in  (Pisum sativum) pea chloroplasts. Thus, Tic12 is an essential constituent that  forms the functional core together with Tic20 in the one-megadalton TIC.', '2022 Oct 27', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koac240', 'ORCID:']
