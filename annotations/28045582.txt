Lon is a highly conserved protein family in eukaryotes and eubacteria and its members all contain both a chaperone and a proteolytic domain that are important for Lon function. Loss of mitochondrial Lon1 leads to deleterious phenotypes in yeast and plants, and causes developmental disorders and aging-related diseases in humans. In Arabidopsis, we have recently reported the multiple roles of Lon1 in mitochondrial protein homeostasis through an evaluation of changes in protein degradation rates in the absence of Lon1. <sup>1</sup> In this addendum, we extend our discussion to the roles of Lon1 in mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation by considering the effects of its loss on ribosome proteins required for protein synthesis and mitochondrial PPR proteins required for RNA regulation.
