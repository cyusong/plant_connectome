Two cDNAs of the enzyme glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1.6.4.2) encoding a dual-targeted isoform (dtGR) and a cytosolic isoform (cGR), were cloned from leaves of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Moderate drought stress (Psi w=-1.5MPa) followed by re-watering was applied to common bean cultivars, one tolerant to drought (IPA), the other susceptible (Carioca) and to cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) cultivars, one tolerant to drought (EPACE-1), and the other susceptible (1183). mRNA levels were much higher for PvcGR than for PvdtGR in all cases. Moderate drought stress induced an up-regulation of the expression of PvcGR in the susceptible cultivars. On the contrary, PvdtGR expression decreased. In the tolerant cowpea EPACE-1, GR gene expression remained stable under drought. During recovery from drought, an up-regulation of the two GR isoforms occurred, with a peak at 6-10h after re-hydration. This suggests that moderate drought stress may lead to a hardening process and acclimation tolerance. The role of GR isoforms in plant tolerance and capacity to recover from drought stress is discussed.
