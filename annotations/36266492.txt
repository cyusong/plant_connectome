Stomata of plant leaves open to enable CO<sub>2</sub> entry for photosynthesis and close to reduce water loss via transpiration. Compared with photosynthesis, stomata respond slowly to fluctuating light, reducing assimilation and water use efficiency. Efficiency gains are possible without a cost to photosynthesis if stomatal kinetics can be accelerated. Here we show that clustering of the GORK channel, which mediates K<sup>+</sup> efflux for stomatal closure in the model plant Arabidopsis, arises from binding between the channel voltage sensors, creating an extended 'sensory antenna' for channel gating. Mutants altered in clustering affect channel gating to facilitate K<sup>+</sup> flux, accelerate stomatal movements and reduce water use without a loss in biomass. Our findings identify the mechanism coupling channel clustering with gating, and they demonstrate the potential for engineering of ion channels native to the guard cell to enhance stomatal kinetics and improve water use efficiency without a cost in carbon fixation.
