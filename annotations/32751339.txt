Plant plasma membrane-localized receptors recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and activate immune responses via various signaling pathways. Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) are considered key signaling factors in plant immunity. BROAD-SPECTRUM RESISTANCE 1 (BSR1), a rice RLCK, plays a significant role in disease resistance. Overexpression of <i>BSR1</i> confers strong resistance against fungal and bacterial pathogens. Our recent study revealed that MAMP-triggered immune responses are mediated by BSR1 in wild-type rice and are hyperactivated in <i>BSR1</i>-overexpressing rice. It was suggested that hyperactivated immune responses were responsible for the enhancement of broad-spectrum disease resistance; however, this remained to be experimentally validated. In this study, we verified the above hypothesis by disrupting the MAMP-recognition system in BSR1-overexpressing rice. To this end, we knocked out <i>OsCERK1</i>, which encodes a well-characterized MAMP-receptor-like protein kinase. In the background of BSR1 overaccumulation, the knockout of <i>OsCERK1</i> nearly abolished the enhancement of blast resistance. This finding indicates that overexpressed <i>BSR1</i>-mediated enhancement of disease resistance depends on the MAMP-triggered immune system, corroborating our previously suggested model.
