['22942378', 'Gibberellin (GA), a diterpene hormone, plays diverse roles in plant growth and  development, including seed germination, stem elongation, and flowering time.  Although it is known that GA accelerates flowering through degradation of  transcription repressors, DELLAs, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood.  We show here that DELLA directly binds to microRNA156 (miR156)-targeted SQUAMOSA  PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors, which promote flowering by  activating miR172 and MADS box genes. The interaction between DELLA and SPL  interferes with SPL transcriptional activity and consequently delays floral  transition through inactivating miR172 in leaves and MADS box genes at shoot apex  under long-day conditions or through repressing MADS box genes at the shoot apex  under short-day conditions. Our results elucidate the molecular mechanism by  which GA controls flowering and provide the missing link between DELLA and MADS  box genes.', '2012 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.101014', 'Wang']
