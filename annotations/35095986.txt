The genome editing toolbox based on CRISPR/Cas9 has brought revolutionary changes to agricultural and plant scientific research. With the development of stable genetic transformation protocols, a highly efficient genome editing system for foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i>) is required. In the present study, we use the CRISPR/Cas9 single- and multi-gene knockout system to target the <i>SiFMBP</i>, <i>SiDof4</i>, <i>SiBADH2</i>, <i>SiGBSS1</i>, and <i>SiIPK1</i> genes in the foxtail millet protoplasts to screen out highly efficient targeted sgRNAs. Then, we recovered homozygous mutant plants with most of the targeted genes through an <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated genetic transformation of foxtail millet. The mutagenesis frequency in the T<sub>0</sub> generation was as high as 100%, and it was passed stably on to the next generation. After screening these targeted edited events, we did not detect off-target mutations at potential sites. Based on this system, we have achieved base editing successfully using two base editors (CBE and ABE) to target the <i>SiALS</i> and <i>SiACC</i> genes of foxtail millet. By utilizing CBE to target the <i>SiALS</i> gene, we created a homozygous herbicide-tolerant mutant plant. The current system could enhance the analysis of functional genomics and genetic improvement of foxtail millet.
