Plant Phosphate Transporter 1 (PHT1) proteins, probably the only influx transporters for phosphate (Pi) uptake, are partially degraded on sufficient Pi levels to prevent excessive Pi accumulation. Therefore, the basal/constitutive expression level of PHT1 genes is vital for maintaining Pi uptake under Pi-replete conditions. Rice (Oryza sativa) OsPHT1;1 is a unique gene as it is highly expressed and not responsive to Pi, however the mechanism for maintaining its basal/constitutive expression remains unknown. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we identified and functionally characterised the transcription factors maintaining the basal/constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1. OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 interact within the nucleus and both bind to the W-box in the OsPHT1;1 promoter. Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1. By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi-dependent manner. Moreover, similar to ospht1;1 mutants, plants expressing the OsWRKY21-SRDX fusion protein (a chimeric dominant suppressor) were impaired in Pi accumulation in Pi-replete roots, accompanied by downregulation of OsPHT1;1 expression. Our findings demonstrated that rice WRKY transcription factors function redundantly to promote Pi uptake by activating OsPHT1;1 expression under Pi-replete conditions, and represent a novel pathway independent of the central Pi signalling system.
