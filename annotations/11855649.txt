['11855649', 'Three genes encoding members of the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins were  identified from Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. sequences deposited in the  expressed sequence tag and genomic sequence databases. Full-length cDNAs for each  of the genes, Cam7, Cam8, and Cam9, were sequenced. Cam7 encodes a conventional  16.8-kDa, 148-amino-acid calmodulin protein (CaM). In contrast, Cam8 and 9 encode  highly diverged isoforms of the protein that share 73 and 49% amino acid sequence  identity, respectively, with CaM7. RNA gel blot and reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that each of the  genes is expressed in leaves, flowers and siliques. To test the functional  properties of the polypeptides encoded by these genes, they were expressed in  Escherichia coli and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each was purified by  Ca2+-dependent hydrophobic affinity chromatography. CaM7, but neither CaM8 nor  CaM9, formed a complex with a basic amphiphilic helical peptide in the presence  of Ca2+ that could be identified by gel electrophoresis. In spite of these in  vitro differences, each of the sequences functionally substituted for yeast CMD1  to maintain viability. Isolation of yeast strains complemented by Cam9 required  selection against the plasmid harboring wild-type yeast sequences, whereas  complementation by Cam7 and Cam8 did not. These results suggest that the  mechanism of action of CaM8 and CaM9 is similar to that of more conventional CaM  sequences. CaM9, and to a lesser degree CaM8, however, appear to represent  Ca2+-binding sensor proteins that interact with a more limited set of target  proteins than do more conventional CaM isoforms.', '2002 Jan', 'Planta', '10.1007/s004250100636', 'Zielinski']
