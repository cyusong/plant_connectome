Non-native plants are now a pervasive feature of ecosystems across the globe<sup>1</sup>. One hypothesis for this pattern is that introduced species occupy open niches in recipient communities<sup>2,3</sup>. If true, then non-native plants should often benefit from low competition for limiting resources that define niches. Many plants have evolved larger size after introduction, consistent with increased access to limiting resources<sup>4-9</sup>. It has been difficult to test whether larger size reflects adaptation to exploit open resources, however, because vacant niches are generally challenging to identify in plants. Here we take advantage of a situation in which a highly invasive non-native plant, <i>Centaurea solstitialis</i> L. (yellow starthistle, hereafter 'YST'), occupies a well-described environmental niche, wherein water is a known limiting resource<sup>10,11</sup>. We use a glasshouse common environment and climatic niche modeling to reveal that invading YST has evolved a higher-fitness life history at the expense of increased dependence on water. Critically, historical declines in resident competitors have made water more available for introduced plants<sup>11,12</sup>, demonstrating how native biodiversity declines can open niches and create opportunities for introduced species to evolve increased resource use, a potentially widespread basis for introduction success and the evolution of invasive life histories.

Non-native plants: !occupy! open niches
Introduced species: !benefit from! low competition
Plants: !evolve larger size! after introduction
YST: !evolved higher-fitness life history! at expense of increased water dependence
Native biodiversity declines: !open niches! for introduced species
Introduced species: !evolve increased resource use! from open niches
