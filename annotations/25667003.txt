In complex, constantly changing environments, plants have developed astonishing survival strategies. These elaborated strategies rely on rapid and precise gene regulation mediated by transcription factors (TFs). TFs represent a large fraction of plant genomes and among them, MYBs and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLHs) have unique inherent properties specific to plants. Proteins of these two TF families can act as homo- or heterodimers, associate with proteins from other protein families, or form MYB/bHLH complexes to regulate distinct cellular processes. The ability of MYBs and bHLHs to interact with multiple protein partners has evolved to keep up with the increased metabolic complexity of multi-cellular organisms. Association and disassociation of dynamic TF complexes in response to developmental and environmental cues are controlled through a plethora of regulatory mechanisms specifically modulating TF activity. Regulation of TFs at the protein level is critical for efficient and precise control of their activity, and thus provides the mechanistic basis for a rapid on-and-off switch of TF activity. In this review, examples of post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, and subcellular mobilization of TFs are discussed with regard to the relevance of these regulatory mechanisms for the specific activation of MYBs and bHLHs in response to a given environmental stimulus.
