['36230919', 'Cell wall integrity (CWI) maintenance is central for plant cells. Mechanical and  chemical distortions, pH changes, and breakdown products of cell wall  polysaccharides activate plasma membrane-localized receptors and induce  appropriate downstream responses. Microbial interactions alter or destroy the  structure of the plant cell wall, connecting CWI maintenance to immune responses.  Cellulose is the major polysaccharide in the primary and secondary cell wall. Its  breakdown generates short-chain cellooligomers that induce Ca(2+)-dependent CWI  responses. We show that these responses require the malectin domain-containing  CELLOOLIGOMER-RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (CORK1) in Arabidopsis and are preferentially  activated by cellotriose (CT). CORK1 is required for cellooligomer-induced  cytoplasmic Ca(2+) elevation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production,  mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, cellulose synthase  phosphorylation, and the regulation of CWI-related genes, including those  involved in biosynthesis of cell wall material, secondary metabolites and  tryptophan. Phosphoproteome analyses identified early targets involved in  signaling, cellulose synthesis, the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi secretory  pathway, cell wall repair and immune responses. Two conserved phenylalanine  residues in the malectin domain are crucial for CORK1 function. We propose that  CORK1 is required for CWI and immune responses activated by cellulose breakdown  products.', '2022 Sep 22', 'Cells', '10.3390/cells11192960', 'Oelmuller']
