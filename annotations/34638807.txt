['34638807', 'Calcium signals are crucial for the activation and coordination of signaling  cascades leading to the establishment of plant defense mechanisms. Here, we  studied the contribution of CML8, an Arabidopsis calmodulin-like protein in  response to Ralstonia solanacearum and to pathogens with different lifestyles,  such as Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and Phytophtora capsici. We used  pathogenic infection assays, gene expression, RNA-seq approaches, and comparative  analysis of public data on CML8 knockdown and overexpressing Arabidopsis lines to  demonstrate that CML8 contributes to defense mechanisms against pathogenic  bacteria and oomycetes. CML8 gene expression is finely regulated at the root  level and manipulated during infection with Ralstonia, and CML8 overexpression  confers better plant tolerance. To understand the processes controlled by CML8,  genes differentially expressed at the root level in the first hours of infection  have been identified. Overexpression of CML8 also confers better tolerance  against Xanthomonas and Phytophtora, and most of the genes differentially  expressed in response to Ralstonia are differentially expressed in these  different pathosystems. Collectively, CML8 acts as a positive regulator against  Ralstonia solanaceraum and against other vascular or root pathogens, suggesting  that CML8 is a multifunctional protein that regulates common downstream processes  involved in the defense response of plants to several pathogens.', '2021 Sep 28', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms221910469', 'Galaud']
