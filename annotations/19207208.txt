['19207208', 'AtHMA1 is a member of the heavy metal-transporting ATPase family. It exhibits  amino acid sequence similarity to two other Zn(II) transporters, AtHMA2 and  AtHMA4, and contains poly-His motifs that are commonly found in Zn(II)-binding  proteins, but lacks some amino acids that are typical for this class of  transporters. AtHMA1 localizes to the chloroplast envelope. In comparison with  wild-type plants, we observed a more pronounced sensitivity in the presence of  high Zn(II) concentrations, and increased accumulation of Zn in the chloroplast  of T-DNA insertional mutants in AtHMA1. The Zn(II)-sensitive phenotype of AtHMA1  knock-out plants was complemented by the expression of AtHMA1 under the control  of its own promoter. The Zn(II)-transporting activity of AtHMA1 was confirmed in  a heterologous expression system, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The sensitivity of  yeast to high concentrations of Zn(II) was altered by the expression of AtHMA1  lacking its N-terminal chloroplast-targeting signal. Taken together, these  results suggest that under conditions of excess Zn(II), AtHMA1 contributes to  Zn(II) detoxification by reducing the Zn content of Arabidopsis thaliana  plastids.', '2009 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03818.x', 'Lee']
