Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes 2 (SMC2) and Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes 4 (SMC4) are the core components of the condensin complexes, which are required for chromosome assembly and faithful segregation during cell division. Because of the crucial functions of both proteins in cell division, much work has been done in various vertebrates, but little information is known about their roles in plants. Here, we identified ZmSMC2 and ZmSMC4 in maize (Zea mays) and confirmed that ZmSMC2 associates with ZmSMC4 via their hinge domains. Immunostaining revealed that both proteins showed dynamic localization during mitosis. ZmSMC2 and ZmSMC4 are essential for proper chromosome segregation and for H3 phosphorylation at Serine 10 (H3S10ph) at pericentromeres during mitotic division. The loss of function of ZmSMC2 and ZmSMC4 enlarges mitotic chromosome volume and impairs sister chromatid separation to the opposite poles. Taken together, these findings confirm and extend the coordinated role of ZmSMC2 and ZmSMC4 in maintenance of normal chromosome architecture and accurate segregation during mitosis.
