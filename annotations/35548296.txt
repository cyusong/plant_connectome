Tubby-like proteins (TLPs) are transcription factors that are widely present in eukaryotes and generally participate in growth and developmental processes. Using genome databases, a total of 22 putative <i>TLP</i> genes were identified in the soybean genome, and unevenly distributed across 13 chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the predicted GmTLP proteins were divided into five groups (I-V). Gene structure, protein motifs, and conserved domains were analyzed to identify differences and common features among the GmTLPs. A three-dimensional protein model was built to show the typical structure of TLPs. Analysis of publicly available gene expression data showed that <i>GmTLP</i> genes were differentially expressed in response to abiotic stresses. Based on those data, <i>GmTLP8</i> was selected to further explore the role of TLPs in soybean drought and salt stress responses. <i>GmTLP8</i> overexpressors had improved tolerance to drought and salt stresses, whereas the opposite was true of <i>GmTLP8</i>-RNAi lines. 3,3-diaminobenzidine and nitro blue tetrazolium staining and physiological indexes also showed that overexpression of <i>GmTLP8</i> enhanced the tolerance of soybean to drought and salt stresses; in addition, downstream stress-responsive genes were upregulated in response to drought and salt stresses. This study provides new insights into the function of GmTLPs in response to abiotic stresses.
