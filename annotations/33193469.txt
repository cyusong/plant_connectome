['33193469', 'Atp11p and Atp12p are members of two chaperone families essential for assembly of  the mitochondrial ATP synthase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens.  However, the role of their homologs in higher plants is unclear with regard to  the assembly of both chloroplast ATP synthase (cpATPase) and mitochondrial ATP  synthase (mtATPase). Here, we show that loss of either Atp11 or Atp12 is lethal  in Arabidopsis. While Atp12 is only localized in mitochondria, Atp11 is present  both in chloroplasts and mitochondria. Yeast two-hybrid analyses showed that, as  their homologs in yeast, Atp11 specifically interacts with the beta subunit of the  mtATPase and cpATPase, and Atp12 interacts with the alpha subunit of the mtATPase,  implying that Atp11 and Atp12 fulfill a conserved task during assembly of ATP  synthase. However, the binding sites for Atp11 in the beta subunit of mtATPase and  cpATPase are slightly different, suggesting that the mechanisms of action may  have evolved in different ways. Although Atp11 interacts with cpATPase beta subunit  as the two assembly factors BFA3 and BFA1, they bind to different sites of the beta  subunit. These results indicate that Atp11 is involved in the assembly of both  cpATPase and mtATPase but Atp12 is specifically required for the assembly of  mtATPase in higher plants.', '2020', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2020.522753', 'Peng']
