Leaf growth is a complex, quantitative trait, controlled by a plethora of regulatory mechanisms. Diverse environmental stimuli inhibit leaf growth to cope with the perceived stress. In plant research, mannitol is often used to impose osmotic stress and study the underlying growth-repressing mechanisms. In growing leaf tissue of plants briefly exposed to mannitol-induced stress, a highly interconnected gene regulatory network is induced. However, early signalling and associated protein phosphorylation events that probably precede part of these transcriptional changes and that potentially act at the onset of mannitol-induced leaf size reduction are largely unknown. Here, we performed a proteome and phosphoproteome analysis on growing leaf tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to mild mannitol-induced stress and captured the fast (within the first half hour) events associated with this stress. Based on this in-depth data analysis, 167 and 172 differentially regulated proteins and phosphorylated sites were found. We provide these data sets as a community resource and we flag differentially phosphorylated proteins with described growth-regulatory functions, but we also illustrate potential novel regulators of shoot growth.
