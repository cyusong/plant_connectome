['15474373', 'The involvement of brassinosteroids in signalling events in plants during UV-B  stress (280-315 nm) was investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana. Brassinosteroids  are involved in growth and development in plants and have also been shown to  enhance stress tolerance. Three mutants deficient in the biosynthetic pathway of  brassinolide (BL; det2, dim1 and cpd) and the BL insensitive mutant (bri1) were  together with visible light irradiated with 3 or 9 h of UV-B radiation  (biologically effective radiation normalised to 300 nm being 0.24 W m(-2)). Also,  a small size control, irx1, and Columbia 0 (Col-0) wild-type plants were examined  under identical conditions. Gene expression patterns were established for these  mutants with a set of four molecular markers (the defence genes chalcone synthase  (CHS), PYROA, pathogenesis-related protein PR-5, and a gene regulated by very low  levels of UV-B, MEB5.2). Although the genes in the brassinodefective mutants were  still induced by UV-B radiation, they all also showed reduced levels of mRNA  transcripts compared with Col-0 and irx1. The bri1 and cpd were the mutants with  lowest levels of molecular marker mRNA transcripts. The effects of impairment of  brassinosteroid signalling also differed between the genes studied, indicating a  need for a complete brassinosteroid pathway in UV-B signalling.', '2004 Sep', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2004.06.011', 'Strid']
