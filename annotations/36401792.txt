Legumes form a symbiotic association with rhizobia and fix atmospheric nitrogen in specialized root organs known as nodules. It is well known that salt stress inhibits root nodule symbiosis by decreasing rhizobial growth, rhizobial infection, nodule number, and nitrogenase activity in diverse legumes. Despite this knowledge, the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing salt stress's inhibition of nodulation and nitrogen fixation are still elusive. In this Viewpoint, we summarize the most recent knowledge of the genetic mechanisms that shape this symbiosis according to the salt levels in the soil. We emphasize the relevance of modulating the activity of the transcription factor Nodule Inception to properly shape the symbiosis with rhizobia accordingly. We also highlight the knowledge gaps that are critical for gaining a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of the root nodule symbiosis to salt-stress conditions. We consider that filling these gaps can help to improve legume nodulation and harness its ecological benefits even under salt-stress conditions.
