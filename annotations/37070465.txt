In plants, cytoplasmic mRNA decay is critical for post-transcriptionally controlling gene expression and for maintaining cellular RNA homeostasis. Arabidopsis DCP1-ASSOCIATED NYN ENDORIBONUCLEASE 1 (DNE1) is a cytoplasmic mRNA decay factor that interacts with proteins involved in mRNA decapping and Nonsense-mediated mRNA Decay (NMD). There is limited information on the functional role of DNE1 in RNA turnover, and the identities of its endogenous targets are unknown. In this study, we utilized RNA degradome approaches to globally investigate DNE1 substrates. Monophosphorylated 5' ends, produced by DNE1, should accumulate in mutants lacking the cytoplasmic exoribonuclease XRN4, but be absent from DNE1 and XRN4 double mutants. In seedlings, we identified over 200 such transcripts, most of which reflect cleavage within coding regions. While most DNE1 targets were NMD-insensitive, some were uORF-containing and NMD-sensitive transcripts, indicating that this endoribonuclease is required for turnover of a diverse set of mRNAs. Transgenic plants expressing DNE1 cDNA with an active site mutation in the endoribonuclease domain abolished the in planta cleavage of transcripts, demonstrating that DNE1 endoribonuclease activity is required for cleavage. Our work provides key insights into the identity of DNE1 substrates and enhances our understanding of DNE1-mediated mRNA decay.
