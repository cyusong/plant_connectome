Melatonin, widely found in various plants as a new antioxidant, could protect plants from various biotic and/or abiotic stresses, including salt stress. <i>MzASMT 1</i> (KJ123721), a gene from <i>Malus zumi</i> Mats, is a key enzyme required for melatonin synthesis. However, whether the overexpression of <i>MzASMT 1</i> could regulate the synthesis of melatonin and improve the salt tolerance in tobacco remains unknown. In this study, the overexpression of <i>MzASMT 1</i> in tobacco increased the melatonin content, and the transgenic lines owned higher salt tolerance capacity. The transgenic lines overexpressing <i>MzASMT 1</i> exhibited lower degree of leaf wilting; much more fresh weight; higher plant height; longer root; higher relative water content (RWC) of leaves, stem, and root; and higher chlorophyll content and Fv/Fm, which makes transgenic lines better adapt to salt stress. The transgenic lines also had higher accumulation of proline, lower accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA), and improved antioxidant systems, which protected plants from cell damage and oxidative stress due to excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation under salt treatment. The transcription of salt response genes was much more highly activated in transgenic lines than in wild type under salt stress. The above results contributed to the understanding of functions for <i>MzASMT 1</i> in tobacco under salt stress and provided a new choice for the application of <i>MzASMT 1</i> in improving plant salt tolerance.
