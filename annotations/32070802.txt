Crop plants have developed a multitude of defense and adaptation responses to protect themselves against invading pathogens and challenging environmental stresses, mostly operating jointly. The plant perception of overall stress induces a coordinated response mediated by complex signaling networks. Experimental evidences proved that plant response to combined biotic and abiotic stresses substantially diverge from the responses to individual stresses. Moreover, the cross-talk of signaling pathways involved in responding to biotic and abiotic stresses is pivoted on several converging elements able to simultaneously modulate the timing and amplitude of the overall plant response. Comprehensively, the interaction between biotic and abiotic stresses can dramatically changes the plant response to the individual stress and the phenotypical outcome of each stress factor. System biology and data mining can synergistically help biologists in finding out regulative mechanisms and key genes controlling the response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Deploying new genetic engineering solutions can rely on the modification of genes involved in resistance/tolerance processes and/or in the modulation of regulatory elements. Finally, a model of the engineered crop for enhanced tolerance to pressures resulting from invasive pathogens and abiotic constraints in semiarid and warm environment is discussed.
