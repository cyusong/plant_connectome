Successful establishment and maintenance of cell polarity is crucial for many aspects of plant development, cellular morphogenesis, response to pathogen attack, and reproduction. Polar cell growth depends on integrating membrane and cell-wall dynamics with signal transduction pathways, changes in ion membrane transport, and regulation of vectorial vesicle trafficking and the dynamic actin cytoskeleton. In this review, we address the critical importance of protein-membrane crosstalk in the determination of plant cell polarity and summarize the role of membrane lipids, particularly minor acidic phospholipids, in regulation of the membrane traffic. We focus on the protein-membrane interface dynamics and discuss the current state of knowledge on three partially overlapping levels of descriptions. Finally, due to their multiscale and interdisciplinary nature, we stress the crucial importance of combining different strategies ranging from microscopic methods to computational modelling in protein-membrane studies.
