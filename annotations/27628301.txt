Engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into rice has been considered a promising strategy to increase photosynthesis and yield. A question that remains to be answered is whether expressing a C<sub>4</sub> metabolic cycle into a C<sub>3</sub> leaf structure and without removing the C<sub>3</sub> background metabolism improves photosynthetic efficiency. To explore this question, we developed a 3D reaction diffusion model of bundle-sheath and connected mesophyll cells in a C<sub>3</sub> rice leaf. Our results show that integrating a C<sub>4</sub> metabolic pathway into rice leaves with a C<sub>3</sub> metabolism and mesophyll structure may lead to an improved photosynthesis under current ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. We analysed a number of physiological factors that influence the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake rate, which include the chloroplast surface area exposed to intercellular air space, bundle-sheath cell wall thickness, bundle-sheath chloroplast envelope permeability, Rubisco concentration and the energy partitioning between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> cycles. Among these, partitioning of energy between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis and the partitioning of Rubisco between mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells are decisive factors controlling photosynthetic efficiency in an engineered C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>4</sub> leaf. The implications of the results for the sequence of C<sub>4</sub> evolution are also discussed.
