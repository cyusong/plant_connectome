['9753775', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor genes encode low molecular weight  proteins which have important functions in cell cycle regulation, development and  perhaps also in tumorigenesis. The first plant CDK inhibitor gene ICK1 was  recently identified from Arabidopsis thaliana. Although the C-terminal domain of  ICK1 contained an important consensus sequence with the mammalian CDK inhibitor  p27Kip1, the remainder of the deduced ICK1 sequence showed little similarity to  any known CDK inhibitors. In vitro assays showed that recombinant ICK1 exhibited  unique kinase inhibitory properties. In the present study we characterized ICK1  in terms of its gene structure, its interaction with both A. thaliana Cdc2a and  CycD3, and its induction by the plant growth regulator, abscisic acid (ABA). ICK1  was expressed at a relatively low level in the tissues surveyed. However, ICK1  was induced by ABA, and along with ICK1 induction there was a decrease in  Cdc2-like histone H1 kinase activity. These results suggest a molecular mechanism  by which plant cell division might be inhibited by ABA. ICK1 clones were also  identified from independent yeast two-hybrid screens using the CycD3 construct.  The implication that ICK1 protein could interact with both Cdc2a and CycD3 was  confirmed by in vitro binding assays. Furthermore, deletion analysis indicated  that different regions of ICK1 are required for the interactions with Cdc2a and  CycD3. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the role of  CDK inhibitors in cell cycle regulation in plant cells.', '1998 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1998.00231.x', 'Fowke']
