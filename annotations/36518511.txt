Late embryonic development abundant proteins (LEAs) are a large family of proteins commonly existing in plants. LEA_2 is the largest subfamily in the LEA, it plays an important role in plant resistance to abiotic stress. In order to explore the characteristics of <i>LEA_2</i> gene family members in alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.), 155 members of <i>LEA_2</i> (<i>MsLEA_2</i>) family were identified from alfalfa genome. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted from the aspects of phylogenetic relationship, chromosome distribution, chromosome colinearity, physical and chemical properties, motif composition, exon-intron structure, <i>cis</i>-element and so on. Expression profiles of <i>MsLEA_2</i> gene were obtained based on Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis and previous RNA-seq data under aluminum (Al) stress. Bioinformatics results were shown that the <i>MsLEA_2</i> genes are distributed on all 32 chromosomes. Among them, 85 genes were present in the gene clusters, accounting for 54.83%, and chromosome Chr7.3 carries the largest number of <i>MsLEA_2</i> (19 <i>LEA_2</i> genes on Chr7.3). Chr7.3 has a unique structure of <i>MsLEA_2</i> distribution, which reveals a possible special role of Chr7.3 in ensuring the function of <i>MsLEA_2</i>. Transcriptional structure analysis revealed that the number of exons in each gene varies from 1 to 3, and introns varies from 0 to 2. <i>Cis</i>-element analysis identified that the promoter region of <i>MsLEA_2</i> is rich in ABRE, MBS, LTR, and MeJARE, indicating <i>MsLEA_2</i> has stress resistance potential under abiotic stress. RNA-seq data and qRT-PCR analyses showed that most of the <i>MsLEA_2</i> members were up-regulated when alfalfa exposed to Al stress. This study revealed that phylogenetic relationship and possible function of <i>LEA_ 2</i> gene in alfalfa, which were helpful for the functional analysis of LEA_ 2 proteins in the future and provided a new theoretical basis for improving Al tolerance of alfalfa.
