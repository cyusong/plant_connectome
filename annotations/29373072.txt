Gibberellins (GAs) and cytokinins (CKs) are hormones that play antagonistic roles in several developmental processes in plants. However, there has been little exploration of their reciprocal interactions. Recent work in Medicago truncatula has revealed that GA signalling can regulate CK levels and response in roots. Here, we examine the reciprocal interaction, by assessing how CKs and the CRE1 (Cytokinin Response 1) CK receptor may influence endogenous GA levels. Real-Time RT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression of key GA biosynthesis genes is regulated in response to a short-term CK treatment and requires the CRE1 receptor. Similarly, GA quantifications indicated that a short-term CK treatment decreases the GA<sub>1</sub> pool in wild-type plants and that GA levels are increased in the cre1 mutant compared to the wild-type. These data suggest that the M. truncatula CRE1-dependent CK signaling pathway negatively regulates bioactive GA levels.
