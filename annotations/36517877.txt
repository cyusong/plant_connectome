Evaluating leaf day respiration rate (RL), which is believed to differ from that in the dark (RDk), is essential for predicting global carbon cycles under climate change. Several studies have suggested that atmospheric CO2 impacts RL. However, the magnitude of such an impact and associated mechanisms remain uncertain. To explore the CO2 effect on RL, wheat (Triticum aestivum) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) plants were grown under ambient (410 ppm) and elevated (820 ppm) CO2 mole fraction ([CO2]). RL was estimated from combined gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements using the Kok method, the Kok-Phi method, and a revised Kok method (Kok-Cc method). We found that elevated growth [CO2] led to an 8.4% reduction in RL and a 16.2% reduction in RDk in both species, in parallel to decreased leaf N and chlorophyll contents at elevated growth [CO2]. We also looked at short-term CO2 effects during gas exchange experiments. Increased RL or RL/RDk at elevated measurement [CO2] were found using the Kok and Kok-Phi methods, but not with the Kok-Cc method. This discrepancy was attributed to the unaccounted changes in Cc in the former methods. We found that the Kok and Kok-Phi methods underestimate RL and overestimate the inhibition of respiration under low irradiance conditions of the Kok curve, and the inhibition of RL was only 6%, representing 26% of the apparent Kok effect. We found no significant long-term CO2 effect on RL/RDk, originating from a concurrent reduction in RL and RDk at elevated growth [CO2], and likely mediated by acclimation of nitrogen metabolism.
