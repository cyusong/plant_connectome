The programs associated with embryonic roots (ERs), primary roots (PRs), lateral roots (LRs), and adventitious roots (ARs) play crucial roles in the growth and development of roots in plants. The root functions are involved in diverse processes such as water and nutrient absorption and their utilization, the storage of photosynthetic products, and stress tolerance. Hormones and signaling pathways play regulatory roles during root development. Among these, auxin is the most important hormone regulating root development. The target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway has also been shown to play a key role in root developmental programs. In this article, the milestones and influential progress of studying crosstalk between auxin and TOR during the development of ERs, PRs, LRs and ARs, as well as their functional implications in root morphogenesis, development, and architecture, are systematically summarized and discussed.
