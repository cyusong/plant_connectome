We used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) to analyze the stability of DNA methylation throughout Arabidopsis development. AFLP can detect genome-wide changes in cytosine methylation produced by DNA demethylation agents, such as 5-azacytidine, or specific mutations at the DDM1 locus. In both cases, cytosine demethylation is associated with a general increase in the presence of amplified fragments. Using this approach, we followed DNA methylation at methylation sensitive restriction sites throughout Arabidopsis development. The results show a progressive DNA methylation trend from cotyledons to vegetative organs to reproductive organs.

AFLP: !detects! DNA methylation
5-azacytidine: !produces! cytosine demethylation
DDM1 locus: !associated with! cytosine demethylation
DNA methylation: !progressively increases! from cotyledons to vegetative organs to reproductive organs
