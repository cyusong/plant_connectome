Spinach is a vegetable with a high oxalate concentration in its tissues. Oxalate efflux from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. cv. Quanneng) roots was rapidly stimulated (within 30 min) by aluminium (Al) treatment. The efflux was constant within 6 h, but increased with increasing Al concentration. The efflux was confined to the root tip (0-5 mm), which showed a 5-fold greater efflux than the root zone distal to the tip (5-10 mm). Oxalate efflux could not be triggered by treatment with the trivalent cation lanthanum or by phosphorus deficiency, indicating that the efflux was specific to the Al treatment. All this evidence suggested that spinach possesses Al-resistance mechanisms. However, spinach was found to be as sensitive to Al toxicity as the Al-sensitive wheat line ES8, which had no Al-dependent organic acids efflux. The Al accumulated in the apical 5 mm of the roots of spinach which was also similar to that in the Al-sensitive wheat after 24 h treatment with 50 microM AlCl(3), indicating a non-exclusion mechanism. In addition, root elongation in spinach was significantly inhibited at pH 4.5, compared with that at pH 6.5. Based on this evidence, it is concluded that the sensitivity to acid stress in spinach could mask the potential role for oxalate to protect the plant roots from Al toxicity.
