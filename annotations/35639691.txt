The tocopherol biosynthetic pathway, encoded by VTE genes 1 through 6, is highly conserved in plants but most large effect quantitative trait loci for seed total tocopherols (totalT) lack VTE genes, indicating other activities are involved. A genome-wide association study of Arabidopsis seed tocopherols showed five of seven significant intervals lacked VTE genes, including the most significant, which mapped to an uncharacterized, seed-specific, envelope-localized, alpha/beta hydrolase with esterase activity, designated AtVTE7. Atvte7 null mutants decreased seed totalT 55% while a leaky allele of the maize ortholog, ZmVTE7, decreased kernel and leaf totalT 38% and 49%, respectively. Overexpressing AtVTE7 or ZmVTE7 partially or fully complemented the Atvte7 seed phenotype and increased leaf totalT by 3.6- and 6.9-fold, respectively. VTE7 has the characteristics of an esterase postulated to provide phytol from chlorophyll degradation for tocopherol synthesis, but bulk chlorophyll levels were unaffected in vte7 mutants and overexpressing lines. Instead, levels of specific chlorophyll biosynthetic intermediates containing partially reduced side chains were impacted and strongly correlated with totalT. These intermediates are generated by a membrane-associated biosynthetic complex containing protochlorophyllide reductase, chlorophyll synthase, geranylgeranyl reductase (GGR) and light harvesting-like 3 protein, all of which are required for both chlorophyll and tocopherol biosynthesis. We propose a model where VTE7 releases prenyl alcohols from chlorophyll biosynthetic intermediates, which are then converted to the corresponding diphosphates for tocopherol biosynthesis.
