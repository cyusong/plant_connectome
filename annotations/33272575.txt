['33272575', 'Nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors (NLRs) play  important roles in plant immunity. The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana contains  about 150 genes encoding NLR proteins, but few of them have been studied. We  transiently expressed a series of NBS-LRR proteins in the leaves of Nicotiana  benthamiana, and found that the CC-NBS-LRR protein (AT1G12290) was able to  trigger cell death, a characterized function for the activation of an NLR  protein. We observed that the YFP-tagged AT1G12290 was localized on the plasma  membrane (PM), and the predicted myristoylation site Gly2 is required for the  localization and function of the protein. Further structure dissection revealed  that the CC domain was enough to activate cell death, and the N-terminal 1-100  amino acid fragment was the minimal region to induce cell death and  self-association. Our research provides important clues to elucidate the  activation mechanism of AT1G12290.', '2021 Jan 1', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.11.111', 'Gao']
