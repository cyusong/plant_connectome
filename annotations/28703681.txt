['28703681', 'One of the main mechanisms of epigenetic control is post translational  modification of histones, and one of the relatively less characterized, yet  functionally important histone modifications is monoubiquitylation, which is  reversed by histone deubiquitinases. In Arabidopsis, only two of such enzymes are  known to date. One of them, OTLD1, deubiquitylates histone 2B and functions as a  transcriptional repressor. But, could the same deubiquitinase act both as a  repressor and an activator? Here, we addressed this question. Using  gain-of-function and loss-of-function Arabidopsis alleles, we showed that OTLD1  can promote expression of a target gene. This transcriptional activation activity  of OTLD1 involves occupation of the target chromatin by this enzyme,  deubiquitination of monoubiquitylated H2B within the occupied regions, and  formation of the euchromatic histone acetylation and methylation marks. Thus,  OTLD1 can play a dual role in transcriptional repression and activation of its  target genes. In these reactions, H2B ubiquitylation acts as both a repressive  and an active mark whereas OTLD1 association with and deubiquitylation of the  target chromatin may represent the key juncture between two opposing effects of  this enzyme on gene expression.', '2017 Jul 3', 'Epigenetics', '10.1080/15592294.2017.1348446', 'Citovsky']
