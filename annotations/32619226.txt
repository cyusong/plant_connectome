The development of economical LED technology has enabled the application of different light qualities and quantities to control plant growth. Although we have a comprehensive understanding of plants' perception of red and blue light, the lack of a dedicated green light sensor has frustrated our utilization of intermediate wavelengths, with many contradictory reports in the literature. We discuss the contribution of red and blue photoreceptors to green light perception and highlight how green light can be used to improve crop quality. Importantly, our meta-analysis demonstrates that green light perception should instead be considered as a combination of distinct 'green' and 'yellow' light-induced responses. This distinction will enable clearer interpretation of plants' behaviour in response to green light as we seek to optimize plant growth and nutritional quality in horticultural contexts.

Red light: !affects! Plant growth 
Blue light: !affects! Plant growth 
Green light: !combines! Red and blue light responses 
Green light: !improves! Crop quality
