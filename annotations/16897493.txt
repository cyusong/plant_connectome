Bombardment of a highly expressed dicot tRNA(ala)(GAC) gene into Zea mays bz-E2 or bz-E5 coleoptiles causes suppression of an Ala(458 )-->Val missense mutation, visualized by the development of anthocyanin pigment. Missense suppression is blocked by mutation of tRNA(ala)(GAC) at a site that prevents aminoacylation by the dicot alanyl-tRNA synthetase, indicating that features identified for expression and utilization of dicot tRNAs also function in monocots. This assay of the expression and utilization of tRNA(ala)(GAC) also can be used to study a variety of tRNAs and their genes, most of which can be relatively easily altered to be charged by alanyl tRNA synthetase.
