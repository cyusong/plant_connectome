In plants, the tight regulation of plasma membrane transporters is essential to maintain nutrient homeostasis. The mechanisms controlling the abundance of transporters, and other integral plasma membrane proteins, now come to light. Ubiquitination appears as a major signal initiating cargo endocytosis and sorting into multivesicular bodies prior to degradation in the vacuole. We have indeed demonstrated that the root iron transporter IRT1 is subjected to ubiquitin-dependent trafficking in root epidermal cells. This control is crucial to keep IRT1 levels at the cell surface low and to cope with the toxicity associated with other readily available metal substrates of IRT1. Our work combined with recent report on the BOR1 boron transporter establishes ubiquitination as a conserved mechanism of plasma membrane protein trafficking in plants, and highlights its importance for plant nutrition.
