One of the most essential questions of biology is to understand how different species have evolved. Hybrid incompatibility, a phenomenon in which hybrids show reduced fitness in comparison with their parents, can result in reproductive isolation and speciation. Therefore, studying hybrid incompatibility provides an entry point in understanding speciation. Hybrid incompatibilities are known throughout taxa, and the underlying mechanisms have mystified scientists since the theory of evolution by means of natural selection was introduced. In plants, it is only in recent years that the high-throughput genetic and molecular tools have become available for the Arabidopsis genus, thus helping to shed light on the different genes and molecular and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie hybrid incompatibilities. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge of diverse mechanisms that are known to contribute to hybrid incompatibility.
