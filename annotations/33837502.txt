Black carrots are potent sources of anthocyanin for the natural food color industry as their anthocyanins contain very high percentages of acylated anthocyanins which are much more stable than non-acylated anthocyanins. Anthocyanins are synthesized by a specific branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway activated by a triad of R2R3-MYB, bHLH and WD40 transcription factors (TFs). Recent studies in black carrots have elucidated major anthocyanin related structural genes and also regulatory TFs. However, the active TFs responsible for anthocyanin production in black carrots differ between cultivars. We have previously shown by RNAseq that DcMYB113 (LOC108213488), a R2R3-MYB TF, was up-regulated in colored as compared to non-colored tissues of the black carrots 'Superblack' and 'CH05544' and that this upregulation was positively correlated with anthocyanin content. However, this gene showed no upregulation in the black carrot 'Nightbird' also included in that study. In the present study, we present a novel R2R3-MYB DcMYB113_NB (LOC108212072) and a complementary bHLH DcEGL1_NB (LOC108210744) isolated from the RNA of 'Nightbird'. Their functionality as anthocyanin regulators was confirmed by their simultaneous expression under the control of a constitutive promoter in the background of the orange carrot 'Danvers 126'. Transformants showed activation of the structural anthocyanin genes and accumulation of anthocyanins across leaves, stems and taproots. Interestingly, the anthocyanin profile of the transformants showed increases of 20 to 30% in acylated anthocyanins as compared to 'Nightbird' resulting in transformants with almost 100% acylated anthocyanins.
