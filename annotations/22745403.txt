Ricklefs and Renner (Reports, 27 January 2012, p. 464) found significant correlations for abundances and species diversities of families and orders of trees on different continents, which they suggested falsifies the neutral theory of biodiversity (NTB). We argue that the correlations among families and orders and the lack of correlations among genera can be explained by the NTB.

Ricklefs and Renner: !found correlations! families/orders
Correlations: !explained by! NTB
NTB: !falsifies! neutral theory of biodiversity
