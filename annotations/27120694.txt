['27120694', 'Virus interactions with plant silencing and innate immunity pathways can  potentially alter the susceptibility of virus-infected plants to secondary  infections with nonviral pathogens. We found that Arabidopsis plants infected  with Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) or transgenic for CaMV silencing suppressor  P6 exhibit increased susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) and  allow robust growth of the Pst mutant hrcC-, which cannot deploy effectors to  suppress innate immunity. The impaired antibacterial defense correlated with the  suppressed oxidative burst, reduced accumulation of the defense hormone salicylic  acid (SA) and diminished SA-dependent autophagy. The viral protein domain  required for suppression of these plant defense responses is dispensable for  silencing suppression but essential for binding and activation of the plant  target-of-rapamycin (TOR) kinase which, in its active state, blocks cellular  autophagy and promotes CaMV translation. Our findings imply that CaMV P6 is a  versatile viral effector suppressing both silencing and innate immunity.  P6-mediated suppression of oxidative burst and SA-dependent autophagy may  predispose CaMV-infected plants to bacterial infection.', '2016 Aug', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13967', 'Pooggin']
