Plant mineral nutrition is critical for agricultural productivity and for human nutrition; however, the availability of mineral elements is spatially and temporally heterogeneous in many ecosystems and agricultural landscapes. Nutrient imbalances trigger intricate signalling networks that modulate plant acclimation responses. One signalling agent of particular importance in such networks is phytomelatonin, a pleiotropic molecule with multiple functions. Evidence indicates that deficiencies or excesses of nutrients generally increase phytomelatonin levels in certain tissues, and it is increasingly thought to participate in the regulation of plant mineral nutrition. Alterations in endogenous phytomelatonin levels can protect plants from oxidative stress, influence root architecture, and influence nutrient uptake and efficiency of use through transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation; such changes optimize mineral nutrient acquisition and ion homeostasis inside plant cells and thereby help to promote growth. This review summarizes current knowledge on the regulation of plant mineral nutrition by melatonin and highlights how endogenous phytomelatonin alters plant responses to specific mineral elements. In addition, we comprehensively discuss how melatonin influences uptake and transport under conditions of nutrient shortage.
