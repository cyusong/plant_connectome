Over two decades ago, short oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were proven to be an effective and rapid technique for analysis of gene function without interference in the plant genome. Our previous research has shown the successful regulation of chalcone synthase (CHS) gene expression in flax by ODN technology. The CHS gene encodes a pivotal enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis. The manipulation of its transcript level was the result of the specific methylation status developed after treatment with ODNs. In further analysis of the application of oligodeoxynucleotides in plants, we will focus on maintaining the methylation status induced originally by ODNs homologous to the regulatory regions of the CHS gene in flax. This article reports the latest investigation applied to stabilization and inheritance of the epigenetic marks induced by plants' treatment with ODNs. The methylation status was analyzed in the particular CCGG motifs located in the CHS gene sequence. Individual plants were able to maintain alterations induced by ODNs. In order to confirm the impact of methylation marks on the nucleosome rearrangement, chromatin accessibility assay was performed. The perpetuation of targeted plant modulation induced by ODNs exhibits strong potential for improving crops and intensified application for medicine, nutrition and industry.
