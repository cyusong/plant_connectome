['29681129', 'Starch phosphorylation by starch-related dikinases glucan, water dikinase (GWD)  and phosphoglucan, water dikinase (PWD) is a key step in starch degradation.  Little information is known about the precise structure of the glucan substrate  utilized by the dikinases and about the mechanisms by which these structures may  be influenced. A 50-kDa starch-binding protein named EARLY STARVATION1 (ESV1) was  analyzed regarding its impact on starch phosphorylation. In various in vitro  assays, the influences of the recombinant protein ESV1 on the actions of GWD and  PWD on the surfaces of native starch granules were analyzed. In addition, we  included starches from various sources as well as truncated forms of GWD. ESV1  preferentially binds to highly ordered, alpha-glucans, such as starch and crystalline  maltodextrins. Furthermore, ESV1 specifically influences the action of GWD and  PWD at the starch granule surface. Starch phosphorylation by GWD is decreased in  the presence of ESV1, whereas the action of PWD increases in the presence of  ESV1. The unique alterations observed in starch phosphorylation by the two  dikinases are discussed in regard to altered glucan structures at the starch  granule surface.', '2018 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13937', 'Fettke']
