Kidney stones are one of the oldest known and common diseases in the urinary tract system. Various human studies have suggested that diets with a higher intake of vegetables and fruits play a role in the prevention of kidney stones. In this review, we have provided an overview of these dietary plants, their main chemical constituents, and their possible mechanisms of action. <i>Camellia sinensis</i> (green tea), <i>Rubus idaeus</i> (raspberry), <i>Rubia cordifolia</i> (common madder), <i>Petroselinum crispum</i> (parsley), <i>Punica granatum</i> (pomegranate), <i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> (mastic), <i>Solanum xanthocarpum</i> (yellow-fruit nightshade), <i>Urtica dioica</i> (stinging nettle), <i>Dolichos biflorus</i> (<i>horse gram</i>), <i>Ammi visnaga</i> (khella), <i>Nigella sativa</i> (black-cumin), <i>Hibiscus sabdariffa</i> (roselle), and <i>Origanum vulgare</i> (oregano) have received considerable interest based on scientific evidence. Beside these dietary plants, phytochemicals-such as catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, diosmin, rutin, quercetin, hyperoside, and curcumin-as antioxidant dietary phyto-phenols were found to be effective for the prevention of urolithiasis (the process of stone formation in the urinary tract). The main underlying mechanisms of these dietary plants and their isolated phytonutrients in the management of urolithiasis include diuretic, antispasmodic, and antioxidant activity, as well as an inhibitory effect on crystallization, nucleation, and aggregation of crystals. The results as presented in this review demonstrate the promising role of dietary plants and phytophenols in the prevention and management of kidney stones. Further investigations are required to confirm the safety and efficacy of these compounds.
