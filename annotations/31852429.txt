Drought is one of the most serious factors limiting plant growth and production. Sheepgrass can adapt well to various adverse conditions, including drought. However, during germination, sheepgrass young seedlings are sensitive to these adverse conditions. Therefore, the adaptability of seedlings is very important for plant survival, especially in plants that inhabit grasslands or the construction of artificial grassland. In this study, we found a sheepgrass MYB-related transcription factor, LcMYB2 that is up-regulated by drought stress and returns to a basal level after rewatering. The expression of LcMYB2 was mainly induced by osmotic stress and was localized to the nucleus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LcMYB2 promoted seed germination and root growth under drought and ABA treatments. Additionally, we confirmed that LcMYB2 can regulate LcDREB2 expression in sheepgrass by binding to its promoter, and it activates the expression of the osmotic stress marker genes AtDREB2A, AtLEA14 and AtP5CS1 by directly binding to their promoters in transgenic Arabidopsis. Based on these results, we propose that LcMYB2 improves plant drought stress tolerance by increasing the accumulation of osmoprotectants and promoting root growth. Therefore, LcMYB2 plays pivotal roles in plant responses to drought stress and is an important candidate for genetic manipulation to create drought-resistant crops, especially during seed germination.
