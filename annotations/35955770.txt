In this study, we investigated the effects of water-deficit stress on the leaf anatomical traits, physiological traits, and stem starch content in <i>Quercus acutissima</i> Carruth and <i>Quercus serrata</i> Murray by subjecting their seedlings to well-watered (WW) and water-deficit stress (WS) treatments. The water stress-induced changes in trichome density, trichome-to-stomata ratio, mesophyll thickness, vein density, vein distance, vein loopiness, vessel diameter, transpiration (E), stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>), water use efficiency (WUE), and starch content were analyzed between two time points. While trichome density did not vary between treatments in <i>Q. acutissima</i>, it dramatically increased in <i>Q. serrata</i> (62.63-98.96 trichomes mm<sup>-2</sup>) at the final week. The WS-treated seedlings had a thicker palisade mesophyll (162.85-169.56 µm) than the WW-treated samples (118.56-132.25 µm) in both species. The vein density and loopiness increased significantly in the WS-treated <i>Q. serrata</i> seedlings. Small-sized vessels (10-50 µm) were more frequent in the WS than the WW in <i>Q. serrata</i>. The E, g<sub>s</sub>, WUE, and starch content declined significantly in the WS-treated seedlings compared with WW-treated samples in both species. Further, principal component analysis revealed significant relationships between anatomical and physiological traits, particularly in the WS-treated seedlings of <i>Q. serrata</i>. The coordinated changes in leaf anatomical traits, physiological traits, and stem starch content indicate an important role in the survival of <i>Q. acutissima</i> and <i>Q. serrata</i> seedlings in water-deficit stress environments, although <i>Q. serrata</i> may show higher survivability under prolonged water stress than <i>Q. acutissima</i>.
