Aphids represent the most destructive of chrysanthemum pests to cultivation. Reliable variety sources of resistance and control methods are limited, so development of highly resistant breeding lines is desirable. An intergeneric hybrid between Dendranthema morifolium (chrysanthemum) variety 'Zhongshanjingui' and Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort) 'Variegata' was attempted. Most of the hybrid embryos aborted at an early developmental stage. Embryo rescue allowed the generation of hybrid plants, whose hybridity was confirmed by a combination of morphological, cytological and GISH analysis. The hybrids were vigorous, flowered normally, and their flower and leaf shape resembled those of the chrysanthemum more than those of the mugwort parent. The hybrids showed much higher resistance to chrysanthemum aphid (Macrosiphoniella sanbourni) than maternal chrysanthemum by inoculation test. The leaves of the hybrid developed a higher density of trichomes and secretory glands compared to the maternal chrysanthemum. GC-MS analysis revealed that approximately 51% of the essential oil in the hybrid leaves were monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, while the proportion in the chrysanthemum was approximately 37%, and in the mugwort was approximately 90%. It is inferred that higher aphid resistance in the hybrid mainly owed to the leaf micromorphology and bioactive essential oil content.
