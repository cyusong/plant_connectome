Along with <i>Plasmopara destructor</i>, <i>Peronosopora belbahrii</i> has arguably been the economically most important newly emerging downy mildew pathogen of the past two decades. Originating from Africa, it has started devastating basil production throughout the world, most likely due to the distribution of infested seed material. Here, we present the genome of this pathogen and results from comparisons of its genomic features to other oomycetes. The assembly of the nuclear genome was around 35.4 Mbp in length, with an N<sub>50</sub> scaffold length of around 248 kbp and an L<sub>50</sub> scaffold count of 46. The circular mitochondrial genome consisted of around 40.1 kbp. From the repeat-masked genome, 9,049 protein-coding genes were predicted, out of which 335 were predicted to have extracellular functions, representing the smallest secretome so far found in peronosporalean oomycetes. About 16% of the genome consists of repetitive sequences, and, based on simple sequence repeat regions, we provide a set of microsatellites that could be used for population genetic studies of <i>P. belbahrii</i>. <i>P. belbahrii</i> has undergone a high degree of convergent evolution with other obligate parasitic pathogen groups, reflecting its obligate biotrophic lifestyle. Features of its secretome, signaling networks, and promoters are presented, and some patterns are hypothesized to reflect the high degree of host specificity in <i>Peronospora</i> species. In addition, we suggest the presence of additional virulence factors apart from classical effector classes that are promising candidates for future functional studies.
