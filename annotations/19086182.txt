The role of host and bacterial genotypes in determining the competitiveness of trehalose utilization mutants of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium medicae was investigated here. Trehalose utilization mutants of S. meliloti and S. medicae were obtained by mutagenesis of their trehalose utilization gene thuB. The mutant strains and the wild type were coinoculated on three cultivars of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and two cultivars of Medicago truncatula and assessed for competitiveness in root colonization, and nodule occupancy. The thuB mutants formed more nodules than their parent strains on two of the three alfalfa lines tested and on one of the two M. truncatula lines tested. They were not more competitive on the other alfalfa and M. truncatula lines. Their competitiveness for nodule occupancy did not correlate positively with their ability to colonize these roots but correlated with the extent of thuB induction in the infection threads. Induction of thuB was shown to be dependent on the concentration of trehalose in the environment. These results suggest a direct role for host trehalose metabolism in early plant-symbiont interactions and show that the ability to manage host-induced stresses during infection, rather than the ability to colonize the root, is critical for competitive nodulation.
