['11526234', 'We have identified a nuclear-encoded Hb from plants (GLB3) that has a central  domain similar to the "truncated" Hbs of bacteria, protozoa, and algae. The  three-dimensional structure of these Hbs is a 2-on-2 arrangement of  alpha-helices, distinct from the 3-on-3 arrangement of the standard globin fold  [Pesce, A., Couture, M., Dewilde, S., Guertin, M., Yamauchi, K., Ascenzi, P.,  Moens, L. & Bolognesi, M. (2000) EMBO J. 19, 2424-2434]. GLB3-like genes are not  found in animals or yeast, but our analysis reveals that they are present in a  wide range of Angiosperms and a Bryophyte. Although cyanobacteria and  Chlamydomonas have 2-on-2 Hbs (GLBN), GLB3 is more likely related to GLBO-type  2-on-2 Hbs from bacteria. Consequently, GLB3 is unlikely to have arisen from a  horizontal transfer between the chloroplast and nuclear genomes. Arabidopsis  thaliana GLB3 protein exhibits unusual concentration-independent binding of O(2)  and CO. The absorbance spectrum of deoxy-GLB3 is unique; the protein forms a  transient six-coordinate structure after reduction and deoxygenation, which  slowly converts to a five-coordinate structure. In A. thaliana, GLB3 is expressed  throughout the plant but responds to none of the treatments that induce plant  3-on-3 Hbs. Our analysis of the sequence, ligand interactions, and expression  profile of GLB3 indicates that this protein has unique biochemical properties,  evolutionary history, and, most likely, a function distinct from those of other  plant Hbs.', '2001 Aug 28', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.191349198', 'Dennis']
