['11826302', 'Regulated growth and cell shape control are fundamentally important to the  function of plant cells, tissues, and organs. The signal transduction cascades  that control localized growth and cell shape, however, are not known. To better  understand the relationship between cytoskeletal organization, organelle  positioning, and regulated vesicle transport, we conducted a forward genetic  screen to identify genes that regulate cytoskeletal organization in plants.  Because of the distinct requirements for microtubules and actin filaments during  leaf trichome development, a trichome-based morphology screen is an efficient  approach to identify genes that affect cytoplasmic organization. The seedling  lethal spike1 mutant was identified based on trichome, cotyledon, and leaf-shape  defects. The predicted SPIKE1 protein shares amino acid identity with a large  family of adapter proteins present in humans, flies, and worms that integrate  extracellular signals with cytoskeletal reorganization. Both the trichome  phenotype and immunolocalization data suggest that SPIKE1 also is involved in  cytoskeletal reorganization. The assembly of laterally clustered foci of  microtubules and polarized growth are early events in cotyledon development, and  both processes are misregulated in spike1 epidermal cells.', '2002 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010346', 'Szymanski']
