Hydrotropism, the differential growth of plant roots directed by a moisture gradient, is a long recognized, but not well-understood plant behavior. Hydrotropism has been characterized in the model plant Arabidopsis. Previously, it was postulated that roots subjected to water stress are capable of undergo water-directed tropic growth independent of the gravity vector because of the loss of the starch granules in root cap columella cells and hence the loss of the early steps in gravitropic signaling. We have recently proposed that starch degradation in these cells during hydrostimulation sustain osmotic stress and root growth for carrying out hydrotropism instead of reducing gravity responsiveness. In addition, we also proposed that abscisic acid (ABA) and water deficit are critical regulators of root gravitropism and hydrotropism, and thus mediate the interacting mechanism between these two tropisms. Our conclusions are based upon experiments performed with the no hydrotropic response (nhr1) mutant of Arabidopsis, which lacks a hydrotropic response and shows a stronger gravitropic response than that of wild type (WT) in a medium with an osmotic gradient.

starch degradation: !sustain osmotic stress! root growth
ABA: !regulates! root gravitropism
ABA: !regulates! hydrotropism
water deficit: !mediates! interaction between gravitropism and hydrotropism
