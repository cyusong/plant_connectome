In green algae, the final step of the plastidial methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway is catalyzed by 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HDR; EC: 1.17.1.2), an enzyme proposed to play a key role in the regulation of isoprenoid biosynthesis. Here we report the isolation and functional characterization of a 1959-bp Dunaliella salina HDR (DsHDR) cDNA encoding a deduced polypeptide of 474 amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analysis implied a cyanobacterial origin for plant and algal HDR genes. Steady-state DsHDR transcript levels were higher in D. salina cells submitted to nutritional depletion, high salt and/or high light, suggesting that DsHDR may respond to the same environmental cues as genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis.
