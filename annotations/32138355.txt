Bacterial spot is a serious disease of tomato caused by at least four species of <i>Xanthomonas</i>. These include <i>X. euvesicatoria</i> (race T1), <i>X. vesicatoria</i> (race T2), <i>X. perforans</i> (races T3 and T4), and <i>X. gardneri,</i> with the distinct geographical distribution of each group. Currently, <i>X. gardneri</i> and <i>X. perforans</i> are two major bacterial pathogens of tomato in North America, with <i>X. perforans</i> (race T4) dominating in east-coast while <i>X. gardneri</i> dominating in the Midwest. The disease causes up to 66% yield loss. Management of this disease is challenging due to the lack of useful chemical control measures and commercial resistant cultivars. Although major genes for resistance (<i>R</i>) and quantitative resistance have been identified, breeding tomato for resistance to bacterial spot has been impeded by multiple factors including the emergence of new races of the pathogen that overcome the resistance, multigenic control of the resistance, linkage drag, non-additive components of the resistance and a low correlation between seedling assays and field resistance. Transgenic tomato with <i>Bs2</i> and <i>EFR</i> genes was effective against multiple races of <i>Xanthomonas</i>. However, it has not been commercialized because of public concerns and complex regulatory processes. The genomics-assisted breeding, effectors-based genomics breeding, and genome editing technology could be novel approaches to achieve durable resistance to bacterial spot in tomato. The main goal of this paper is to understand the current status of bacterial spot of tomato including its distribution and pathogen diversity, challenges in disease management, disease resistance sources, resistance genetics and breeding, and future prospectives with novel breeding approaches.
