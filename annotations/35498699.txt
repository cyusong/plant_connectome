<i>Wheat dwarf virus</i> (WDV) is transmitted by the leafhopper <i>Psammotettix alienus.</i> As a major pathogen in wheat and other cereals, WDV causes high yield losses in many European countries. Due to climate change, insect-transmitted viruses will become more important and the restrictions in the use of insecticides efficient against <i>P. alienus</i> renders growing of WDV resistant/tolerant varieties the only effective strategy to control WDV. So far, there is little information about the possible sources of resistance and no known information about the genome regions responsible for the resistance. In a screening for WDV resistance using artificial inoculation in gauze houses, a panel of 500 wheat accessions including cultivars, gene bank accessions, and wild relatives of wheat was phenotyped for virus titer, infection rate, as well as plant height and yield parameters relative to healthy controls of the same genotype. Additionally, 85 <i>T. aestivum-Ae. tauschii</i> intogression lines were tested for WDV resistance in the greenhouse. A subset of 250 hexaploid wheat accessions was genotyped with the 15k iSelect SNP Chip. By genome-wide association study (GWAS), the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for partial WDV resistance were identified. Within these studies, one cultivar was identified showing an average infection rate of only 5.7%. By analyzing single seed descent (SSD) and doubled haploid (DH) populations comprising 153 and 314 individuals for WDV resistance and by genotyping these with the 25k iSelect SNP Chip, QTL for yield per plant, thousand-grain weight, and relative virus titer were validated on chromosomes 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 4A, 5A, 6A, and 7A. These results will be the basis for marker-assisted selection for WDV resistance to replacing the laborious, time-consuming, and technically challenging phenotyping with WDV bearing leafhoppers.
