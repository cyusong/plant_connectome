Ratooning in sugarcane is a crucial strategy for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the sugarcane industry. Knowledge gap relating to the interaction between rhizosphere microbiome and ratooning crop, particularly the impact of different sugarcane cultivars on the rhizosphere microbiome in consecutive ratooning, requires additional research. The response of two different sugarcane cultivars, viz ZZ-1 and ZZ-13, were evaluated in consecutive ratooning towards the rhizosphere microbial community and cane morphological characters. Significant changes in the rhizosphere microbiome were observed in the second ratooning over the years. Several important genera were observed in high abundance during the second ratooning, including Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Bradyzhizobium, and Acidothermus. Cultivar ZZ-13 caused more alterations in the rhizosphere microbiome than ZZ-1, resulting in a more favorable rhizosphere environment for sugarcane growth. The genotypes also varied in terms of nutrients and enzyme activity over the years. There were significant differences between the genotypes and year for number of stalks and yield was significant for genotypes, years and genotype × year. This finding will help to understand thorough interactions between rhizosphere microorganisms and ratoon sugarcane and lay the foundation for promoting and maximizing yield as far as possible. In the future, this work can serve as guidance in sugarcane husbandry, mainly in Guangxi, China.
