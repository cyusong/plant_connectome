['12182706', 'Using the two-hybrid technique we identified a novel protein whose N-terminal 88  amino acids (aa) interact with the C-terminal regulatory domain of the plasma  membrane (PM) H+-ATPase from Arabidopsis thaliana (aa 847-949 of isoform AHA1).  The corresponding gene has been named Ppi1 for Proton pump interactor 1. The  encoded protein is 612 aa long and rich in charged and polar residues, except for  the extreme C-terminus, where it presents a hydrophobic stretch of 24 aa. Several  genes in the A. thaliana genome and many ESTs from different plant species share  significant similarity (50-70% at the aa level over stretches of 200-600 aa) to  Ppi1. The PPI1 N-terminus, expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with either  GST or a His-tag, binds the PM H+-ATPase in overlay experiments. The same fusion  proteins and the entire coding region fused to GST stimulate H+-ATPase activity.  The effect of the His-tagged peptide is synergistic with that of fusicoccin (FC)  and of tryptic removal of a C-terminal 10 kDa fragment. The His-tagged peptide  binds also the trypsinised H+-ATPase. Altogether these results indicate that PPI1  N-terminus is able to modulate the PM H+-ATPase activity by binding to a site  different from the 14-3-3 binding site and is located upstream of the trypsin  cleavage site.', '2002 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2002.01373.x', 'De']
