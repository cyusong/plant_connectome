Phosphorylation regulated by the two-component system (TCS) is a very important approach signal transduction in most of living organisms. Histidine phosphotransfer (HP) is one of the important members of the TCS system. Members of the HP gene family have implications in plant stresses tolerance and have been deeply studied in several crops. However, upland cotton is still lacking with complete systematic examination of the HP gene family. A total of 103 HP gene family members were identified. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogeny of HPs distributed them into 7 clades that contain the highly conserved amino acid residue "XHQXKGSSXS", similar to the Arabidopsis HP protein. Gene duplication relationship showed the expansion of HP gene family being subjected with whole-genome duplication (WGD) in cotton. Varying expression profiles of HPs illustrates their multiple roles under altering environments particularly the abiotic stresses. Analysis is of transcriptome data signifies the important roles played by HP genes against abiotic stresses. Moreover, protein regulatory network analysis and VIGS mediated functional approaches of two HP genes (GhHP23 and GhHP27) supports their predictor roles in salt and drought stress tolerance. This study provides new bases for systematic examination of HP genes in upland cotton, which formulated the genetic makeup for their future survey and examination of their potential use in cotton production.
