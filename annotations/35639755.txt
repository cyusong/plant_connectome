Rice false smut caused by Ustilaginoidea virens is emerging as a devastating disease of rice (Oryza sativa) worldwide; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying U. virens virulence and pathogenicity remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the small cysteine-rich secreted protein SCRE6 in U. virens is translocated into host cells during infection as a virulence factor. Knockout of SCRE6 leads to attenuated U. virens virulence to rice. SCRE6 and its homologs in U. virens function as a novel family of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases harboring no canonical phosphatase motif. SCRE6 interacts with and dephosphorylates the negative immune regulator OsMPK6 in rice, thus enhancing its stability and suppressing plant immunity. Ectopic expression of SCRE6 in transgenic rice promotes pathogen infection by suppressing the host immune responses. Our results reveal a previously unidentified fungal infection strategy in which the pathogen deploys a family of tyrosine phosphatases to stabilize a negative immune regulator in the host plant to facilitate its infection.
