The desiccation-tolerant phenotype of angiosperm resurrection plants is thought to rely on the induction of protective mechanisms that maintain cellular integrity during water loss. Two-dimensional (2D) sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of the Xerophyta viscosa Baker proteome was carried out during dehydration to identify proteins that may play a role in such mechanisms. Quantitative analysis revealed a greater number of changes in protein expression levels at 35% than at 65% relative water content (RWC) compared to fully hydrated plants, and 17 dehydration-responsive proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS). Proteins showing increased abundance during drying included an RNA-binding protein, chloroplast FtsH protease, glycolytic enzymes and antioxidants. A number of photosynthetic proteins declined sharply in abundance in X. viscosa at RWC below 65%, including four components of photosystem II (PSII), and Western blot analysis confirmed that two of these (psbP and Lhcb2) were not detectable at 30% RWC. These data confirm that poikilochlorophylly in X. viscosa involves the breakdown of photosynthetic proteins during dismantling of the thylakoid membranes. In contrast, levels of these photosynthetic proteins were largely maintained during dehydration in the homoiochlorophyllous species Craterostigma plantagineum Hochst, which does not dismantle thylakoid membranes on drying.
