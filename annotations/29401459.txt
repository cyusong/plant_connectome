Organ size control is of particular importance for developmental biology and agriculture, but the mechanisms underlying organ size regulation remain elusive in plants. Meristemoids, which possess stem cell-like properties, have been recognized to play important roles in leaf growth. We have recently reported that the Arabidopsis F-box protein STERILE APETALA (SAP)/SUPPRESSOR OF DA1 (SOD3) promotes meristemoid proliferation and regulates organ size by influencing the stability of the transcriptional regulators PEAPODs (PPDs). Here we demonstrate that KIX8 and KIX9, which function as adaptors for the corepressor TOPLESS and PPD, are novel substrates of SAP. SAP interacts with KIX8/9 and modulates their protein stability. Further results show that SAP acts in a common pathway with KIX8/9 and PPD to control organ growth by regulating meristemoid cell proliferation. Thus, these findings reveal a molecular mechanism by which SAP targets the KIX-PPD repressor complex for degradation to regulate meristemoid cell proliferation and organ size.
