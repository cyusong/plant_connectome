Polyploid breeding is an effective approach to improve plant biomass and quality. Both fast growth and dwarf types of <i>in vitro</i> or <i>ex vitro</i> plants are produced after polyploidization. However, little is known regarding the dwarf type mechanism in polyploids grown <i>in vitro</i>. In this study, the morphological and cytological characteristics were measured in tetraploid and diploid hybrid sweetgum (<i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i> × <i>L. formosana</i>) with the same genetic background. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to analyse shoot and root variations between tetraploid and diploid plants; important metabolites were validated. The results showed that the shoot and root lengths were significantly shorter in tetraploids than in diploids after 25 d of culture. Most tetraploid root cells were wider and more irregular, and the length of the meristematic zone was shorter, while tetraploid cells were significantly larger than diploid cells. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in the plant growth and organ elongation pathways, such as plant hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction, sugar and starch metabolism, and cell cycles. Hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction genes, such as <i>YUCCA</i>, <i>TAA1</i>, <i>GH3</i>, <i>SAUR</i>, <i>CPS</i>, <i>KO</i>, <i>KAO</i>, <i>GA20ox</i>, <i>GA3ox</i>, <i>BAS1</i> and <i>CYCD3</i>, which help to regulate organ elongation, were generally downregulated. The auxin, gibberellin, and brassinolide (BL) contents in roots and stems were significantly lower in tetraploids than in diploids, which may greatly contribute to slow growth in the roots and stems of tetraploid regenerated plants. Exogenous gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which induced plant cell elongation, could significantly promote growth in the stems and roots of tetraploids. In summary, comparative transcriptomics and metabolite analysis showed that the slow growth of regenerated tetraploid hybrid sweetgum was strongly related to auxin and gibberellin deficiency. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie dwarfism in allopolyploid hybrid sweetgum.
