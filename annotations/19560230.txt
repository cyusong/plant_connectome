The miR172 gene is involved in the regulation of flowering time and floral organ identity in Arabidopsis thaliana through regulation of APETALA2 (AP2)-like genes' activity. AP2 plays critical roles in establishing meristem and organ identity during floral development. Additionally, the AP2-like genes including TARGET OF EAT1 (TOE1), TOE2, SMZ, SNZ are involved in the timing of flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. In our study, a full-length cDNA encoding InAP2-like transcription factor was isolated from cotyledons of morning glory (Ipomoea nil named also Pharbitis nil), a model short day plant. The identified sequence shows significant similarity to the cDNA of TOE1 from Arabidopsis thaliana and contains nucleotides complementary to miR172. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis and in situ hybridization showed that the accumulation of InAP2-like transcripts was high, especially in cotyledons of 5-d-old seedlings. During the 16h-long inductive night, an increase in the expression of InAP2-like and a decrease in the accumulation of miR172 were observed. Auxin and ethylene treatment, as well as a "night-break", which completely eliminated flowering induction of Ipomoea nil, caused a decrease in the InAP2-like mRNAs levels in cotyledons of Ipomoea nil. These results suggest the potential involvement of miR172 and InAP2-like in the mechanism of flowering induction in Ipomoea nil.
