The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway provides the vital cofactors and pigments for photoautotrophic growth (chlorophyll), several essential redox reactions in electron transport chains (haem), N- and S-assimilation (sirohaem), and photomorphogenic processes (phytochromobilin). While the biochemistry of the pathway is well understood and almost all genes encoding enzymes of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis have been identified in plants, the post-translational control and organization of the pathway remains to be clarified. Post-translational mechanisms controlling metabolic activities are of particular interest since tetrapyrrole biosynthesis needs adaptation to environmental challenges. This review surveys post-translational mechanisms that have been reported to modulate metabolic activities and organization of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway.
