['18443413', 'Leaf senescence is a highly regulated genetic process that constitutes the last  stage of plant development and provides adaptive fitness by relocating  metabolites from senescing leaves to reproducing seeds. Characterization of  various senescence mutants, mostly in Arabidopsis, and genome-wide analyses of  gene expression, have identified a wide array of regulatory components, including  transcription factors and enzymes as well as signaling molecules mediating growth  hormones and environmental stress responses. In this work we demonstrate that a  membrane-associated NAC transcription factor, NTL9, mediates osmotic stress  signaling in leaf senescence. The NTL9 gene is induced by osmotic stress.  Furthermore, activation of the dormant, membrane-associated NTL9 is elevated  under the same conditions. A series of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) were  upregulated in transgenic plants overexpressing an activated form of NTL9, and  some of them were slightly but reproducibly downregulated in a T-DNA insertional  NTL9 knockout mutant. These observations indicate that NTL9 mediates osmotic  stress responses that affect leaf senescence, providing a genetic link between  intrinsic genetic programs and external signals in the control of leaf  senescence.', '2008 May 31', 'Mol Cells', '52', 'Park']
