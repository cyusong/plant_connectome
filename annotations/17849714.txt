Germin-like proteins (GLP) have various proposed roles in plant development and defense. Seven novel GLP cDNA clones were isolated from grapevine (Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction expression analysis revealed that the VvGLP genes exhibit diverse and highly specific patterns of expression in response to a variety of abiotic and biotic treatments, including challenge by Erysiphe necator, Plasmopara viticola, and Botrytis cinerea, suggesting a diversity of roles for each of the GLP family members. Significantly, one of the grapevine GLP genes, VvGLP3, is induced specifically by E. necator infection and expression is closely linked to the site of infection. Subcellular localization of VvGLP3 determined by transient expression of a VvGLP3:GFP fusion construct in onion cells indicated that the recombinant protein was targeted to the cell wall. Recombinant VvGLP3 was successfully expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana and the partially purified recombinant protein was demonstrated to have superoxide dismutase activity. This data has provided an insight into the diverse nature of the GLP family in grapevine and suggests that VvGLP3 may be involved in the defense response against E. necator.
