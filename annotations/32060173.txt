Transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an indispensable research tool in modern plant biology. Virtually all RNA-seq studies provide a snapshot of the steady state transcriptome, which contains valuable information about RNA populations at a given time but lacks information about the dynamics of RNA synthesis and degradation. Only a few specialized sequencing techniques, such as global run-on sequencing, have been used to provide information about RNA synthesis rates in plants. Here, we demonstrate that RNA labeling with the modified, nontoxic uridine analog 5-ethynyl uridine (5-EU) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings provides insight into plant transcriptome dynamics. Pulse labeling with 5-EU revealed nascent and unstable RNAs, RNA processing intermediates generated by splicing, and chloroplast RNAs. Pulse-chase experiments with 5-EU allowed us to determine RNA stabilities without the need for chemical transcription inhibitors such as actinomycin and cordycepin. Inhibitor-free, genome-wide analysis of polyadenylated RNA stability via 5-EU pulse-chase experiments revealed RNAs with shorter half-lives than those reported after chemical inhibition of transcription. In summary, our results indicate that the Arabidopsis nascent transcriptome contains unstable RNAs and RNA processing intermediates and suggest that polyadenylated RNAs have low stability in plants. Our technique lays the foundation for easy, affordable, nascent transcriptome analysis and inhibitor-free analysis of RNA stability in plants.
