RNA silencing functions as an anti-viral defence in plants through the action of DICER-like (DCL) and ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins. Despite the importance of this mechanism, little is known about the functional consequences of variation in genes encoding RNA silencing components. The AGO2 protein has been shown to be important for defense against multiple viruses, and we investigated how naturally occurring differences in AGO2 between and within species affects its antiviral activities. We find that the AGO2 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana, but not Nicotiana benthamiana, effectively limits potato virus X (PVX). Consistent with this, we find that the A. thaliana AGO2 gene shows a high incidence of polymorphisms between accessions, with evidence of selective pressure. Using functional analyses, we identify polymorphisms that specifically affect AGO2 antiviral activity, without interfering with other AGO2-associated functions such as anti-bacterial resistance or DNA methylation. Our results suggest that viruses adapt to overcome RNA silencing in their hosts. Furthermore, they indicate that plant-virus interactions have influenced natural variation in RNA-silencing components and that the latter may be a source of genetically encoded virus resistance.
