Cotton is the most important crop for fiber production worldwide. However, the cotton boll weevil (CBW) is an insect pest that causes significant economic losses in infested areas. Current control methods are costly, inefficient, and environmentally hazardous. Herein, we generated transgenic cotton lines expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules to trigger RNA interference-mediated gene silencing in CBW. Thus, we targeted three essential genes coding for chitin synthase 2, vitellogenin, and ecdysis-triggering hormone receptor. The stability of expressed dsRNAs was improved by designing a structured RNA based on a viroid genome architecture. We transformed cotton embryos by inserting a promoter-driven expression cassette that overexpressed the dsRNA into flower buds. The transgenic cotton plants were characterized, and positive PCR transformed events were detected with an average heritability of 80%. Expression of dsRNAs was confirmed in floral buds by RT-qPCR, and the T<sub>1</sub> cotton plant generation was challenged with fertilized CBW females. After 30 days, data showed high mortality (around 70%) in oviposited yolks. In adult insects fed on transgenic lines, chitin synthase II and vitellogenin showed reduced expression in larvae and adults, respectively. Developmental delays and abnormalities were also observed in these individuals. Our data remark on the potential of transgenic cotton based on a viroid-structured dsRNA to control CBW.
