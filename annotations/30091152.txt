Herbivory creates conflicts between a plant's need to allocate resources for growth and defense. It is not yet clear how plants rebalance resource utilization between growth and defense in response to increasing grazing intensity. We measured characteristics of the primary and secondary metabolism of Leymus chinensis at five levels of grazing intensity (control, light, moderate, heavy and extremely heavy). Furthermore, we evaluated hormone signaling by quantifying the impact of key hormones on plant growth and defense. Under light grazing intensity, indole-3-acetic acid and jasmonates appeared to promote the growth of L. chinensis through a high photosynthetic rate, high water-use efficiency and high soluble protein contents, whereas abscisic acid decreased these properties. Under moderate grazing intensity, L. chinensis had a low photosynthetic capacity but greater production of secondary metabolites (tannins, total flavonoids and total phenols), possibly induced by salicylic acid. When the grazing pressure further intensified, L. chinensis translocated more carbohydrates to its roots in order to survive and regrow. Leymus chinensis therefore exhibited a trade-off between growth and defense in order to survive and reproduce under herbivory. Plants developed different mechanisms to enhance their grazing tolerance by means of hormonal regulation.

Indole-3-acetic acid: !promotes! growth
