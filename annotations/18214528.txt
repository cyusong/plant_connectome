A unique fiber spinning was found in protoplasts from white birch (Betula platyphylla) leaves under an acidic medium containing high concentration of Ca(2+). After expanding from 10 to 100 microm in diameter under the culture condition, the protoplast started secreting a gigantic fiber while moving in a spiral way. Real time video analyses elucidated that the orientation, rate and pattern of the motion were directed due to the inverse force of the fiber spinning. Moreover, observation using several microscopic methods accompanied with histochemical staining and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis indicated that the fiber was composed of 400-500 nm wide (1-->3)-beta-glucan hollow sub-fibrils. This entire phenomenon may be a response against the stress imposed. The observation presented provides an understanding of the unique relationship between fiber spinning and the bottom-up fiber fabrication from nano to micro scales.
