Ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10) is an ubiquitous protein that participates in joining the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits into a functional 80S ribosome; however, increasing evidences indicate that RPL10 from various organisms has multiple extra ribosomal functions, besides being a constituent of ribosome and its role in translation. Arabidopsis thaliana contains in its genome three genes encoding RPL10, named RPL10A, RPL10B and RPL10C. Previously, we found that in maize and in A. thaliana, UV-B induces a reduction in protein biosynthesis, probably as a consequence of ribosomal damage; however, cellular recovery occurs in the absence of UV-B. Here, we show that RPL10s are differentially regulated by UV-B in a dosage and time dependent manner: RPL10C is induced, RPL10B is down regulated at high UV-B intensity, and RPL10A is not UV-B regulated. In addition, by coimmunoprecipitation studies using RPL10 antibodies and proteins from control and UV-B irradiated Arabidopsis plants, we demonstrate that RPL10 associates with different proteins under the two different conditions, including nuclear proteins, suggesting that at least one isoform may have extra-ribosomal roles.
