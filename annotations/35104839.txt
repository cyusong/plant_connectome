Although UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylases (UXSs) have been well studied with regard to catalysing the conversion of UDP-glucuronic acid into UDP-xylose, their biological roles in grasses remain largely unknown. The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains six UXSs, but none of them has been genetically characterized. Here, we reported on the characterization of a novel rice fragile culm mutant, fc18, which exhibited brittleness with altered cell wall and pleiotropic defects in growth. Map-based cloning and transgenic analyses revealed that the FC18 gene encodes a cytosol-localized OsUXS3 and is widely expressed with higher expression in xylan-rich tissues. Monosaccharide analysis showed that the xylose level was decreased in fc18, and cell wall fraction determinations confirmed that the xylan content in fc18 was lower, suggesting that UDP-xylose from FC18 participates in xylan biosynthesis. Moreover, the fc18 mutant displayed defective cellulose properties, which led to an enhancement in biomass saccharification. Furthermore, expression of genes involved in sugar metabolism and phytohormone signal transduction was largely altered in fc18. Consistent with this, the fc18 mutant exhibited significantly reduced free auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) content and lower expression levels of PIN family genes compared with wild type. Our work reveals the physiological roles of FC18/UXS3 in xylan biosynthesis, cellulose deposition, and plant growth in rice.
