Eukaryotic cells contain organelles surrounded by monolayer or bilayer membranes. Organelles take part in highly dynamic and organized interactions at membrane contact sites, which play vital roles during development and response to stress. The endoplasmic reticulum extends throughout the cell and acts as an architectural scaffold to maintain the spatial distribution of other membrane-bound organelles. In this review, we highlight the structural organization, dynamics, and physiological functions of membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum and various membrane-bound organelles, especially recent advances in plants. We briefly introduce how the combined use of dynamic and static imaging techniques can enable monitoring of the cross-talk between organelles via membrane contact sites. Finally, we discuss future directions for research fields related to membrane contacts.
