Organic agriculture is proposed as a promising approach to achieving sustainable food systems, but its feasibility is also contested. We use a food systems model that addresses agronomic characteristics of organic agriculture to analyze the role that organic agriculture could play in sustainable food systems. Here we show that a 100% conversion to organic agriculture needs more land than conventional agriculture but reduces N-surplus and pesticide use. However, in combination with reductions of food wastage and food-competing feed from arable land, with correspondingly reduced production and consumption of animal products, land use under organic agriculture remains below the reference scenario. Other indicators such as greenhouse gas emissions also improve, but adequate nitrogen supply is challenging. Besides focusing on production, sustainable food systems need to address waste, crop-grass-livestock interdependencies and human consumption. None of the corresponding strategies needs full implementation and their combined partial implementation delivers a more sustainable food future.

Organic agriculture: !needs! More land 
Organic agriculture: !reduces! N-surplus and pesticide use 
Reductions of food wastage: !reduces! Production and consumption of animal products 
Greenhouse gas emissions: !improve! Under organic agriculture 
Adequate nitrogen supply: !challenging! Under organic agriculture 
Sustainable food systems: !need to address! Waste, crop-grass-livestock interdependencies and human consumption
