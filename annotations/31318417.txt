Unlike dicots, the robust root system in grass species largely originates from stem base during postembryonic development. The mechanisms by which plant hormone signaling pathways control the architecture of adventitious root remain largely unknown. Here, we studied the modulations in global genes activity in developing rice adventitious root by genome-wide RNA sequencing in response to external auxin and cytokinin signaling cues. We further analyzed spatiotemporal regulations of key developmental regulators emerged from our global transcriptome analysis. Interestingly, some of the key cell fate determinants such as homeodomain transcription factor (TF), OsHOX12, no apical meristem protein, OsNAC39, APETALA2/ethylene response factor, OsAP2/ERF-40 and WUSCHEL-related homeobox, OsWOX6.1 and OsWOX6.2, specifically expressed in adventitious root primordia. Functional analysis of one of these regulators, an auxin-induced TF containing AP2/ERF domain, OsAP2/ERF-40, demonstrates its sufficiency to confer the adventitious root fate. The ability to trigger the root developmental program is largely attributed to OsAP2/ERF-40-mediated dose-dependent transcriptional activation of genes that can facilitate generating effective auxin response, and OsERF3-OsWOX11-OsRR2 pathway. Our studies reveal gene regulatory network operating in response to hormone signaling pathways and identify a novel TF regulating adventitious root developmental program, a key agronomically important quantitative trait, upstream of OsERF3-OsWOX11-OsRR2 pathway.
