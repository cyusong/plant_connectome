After herbivore feeding, poplar trees produce complex volatile blends containing terpenes, green leaf volatiles, aromatics, and nitrogen-containing compounds such as aldoximes and nitriles. It has been shown recently that volatile aldoximes released from gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) caterpillar-damaged black poplar (Populus nigra) trees attract parasitoids that are caterpillar enemies. In western balsam poplar (P. trichocarpa), volatile aldoximes are produced by 2 P450 monooxygenases, CYP79D6v3 and CYP79D7v2. A gene fragment with high similarity to CYP79D6/7 was recently shown to be upregulated in herbivore-damaged leaves of P. nigra. In the present study we report the cloning and characterization of this gene, designated as CYP79D6v4. Recombinant CYP79D6v4 was able to convert different amino acids into the corresponding aldoximes, which were also found in the volatile blend of P. nigra. Thus, CYP79D6v4 is most likely involved in herbivore-induced aldoxime formation in black poplar.
