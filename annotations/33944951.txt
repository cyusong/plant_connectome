Diatoms are a large group of marine algae that are responsible for about one-quarter of global carbon fixation. Light-harvesting complexes of diatoms are formed by the fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c proteins and their overall organization around core complexes of photosystems (PSs) I and II is unique in the plant kingdom. Using cryo-electron tomography, we have elucidated the structural organization of PSII and PSI supercomplexes and their spatial segregation in the thylakoid membrane of the model diatom species Thalassiosira pseudonana. 3D sub-volume averaging revealed that the PSII supercomplex of T. pseudonana incorporates a trimeric form of light-harvesting antenna, which differs from the tetrameric antenna observed previously in another diatom, Chaetoceros gracilis. Surprisingly, the organization of the PSI supercomplex is conserved in both diatom species. These results strongly suggest that different diatom classes have various architectures of PSII as an adaptation strategy, whilst a convergent evolution occurred concerning PSI and the overall plastid structure.
