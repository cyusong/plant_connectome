The Na<sup>+</sup> /H<sup>+</sup> antiporter SOS1 enhances the salinity tolerance of a number of plant species, but its involvement in the response to hypoxia is less well known. We presented chrysanthemum homologs CmSOS1 and CmRCD1 coordinately mediate waterlogging tolerance by maintaining membrane integrity and minimizing the level of reactive oxygen species.
