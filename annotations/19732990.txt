We describe the application of a novel genome walking (GW) strategy for the one-shot identification of members of multigene families. The method was used to study the spinach Lhcb1 family (encoding the light harvesting complex protein Lhcb1), for which three cDNAs were known. Two additional genes and regulatory regions of the five members of the family were identified. For one of the newly detected genes, sequencing of full-length cDNA and analysis of regulatory regions by gel-shift are also reported. To our best knowledge, this is the first report on the use of a GW approach for the study of a multigene family.
