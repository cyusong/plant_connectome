In this study, daily changes over a short period and diurnal progression of spectral reflectance at the leaf level were used to identify spring wheat genotypes (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) susceptible to adverse conditions. Four genotypes were grown in pots experiments under semi-controlled conditions in Chile and Spain. Three treatments were applied: i) control (<i>C</i>), ii) water stress (<i>WS</i>), and iii) combined water and heat shock (<i>WS+T</i>). Spectral reflectance, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were performed on flag leaves for three consecutive days at anthesis. High canopy temperature ( <b><i>H</i></b> <i><sub>CT</sub></i> ) genotypes showed less variability in their mean spectral reflectance signature and chlorophyll fluorescence, which was related to weaker responses to environmental fluctuations. While low canopy temperature ( <b><i>L</i></b> <i><sub>CT</sub></i> ) genotypes showed greater variability. The genotypes spectral signature changes, in accordance with environmental fluctuation, were associated with variations in their stomatal conductance under both stress conditions (<i>WS</i> and <i>WS+T</i>); <b><i>L</i></b> <i><sub>CT</sub></i> genotypes showed an anisohydric response compared that of <b><i>H</i></b> <i><sub>CT</sub></i> , which was isohydric. This approach could be used in breeding programs for screening a large number of genotypes through proximal or remote sensing tools and be a novel but simple way to identify groups of genotypes with contrasting performances.
