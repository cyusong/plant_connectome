['30658512', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a fundamental role in plant growth and development, as  well as in the responses to abiotic stresses. Previous studies have revealed that  many components in ABA and drought stress signaling pathways are ubiquitinated by  E3 ligases. In this study, AtPPRT1, a putative C3HC4 zinc-finger ubiquitin E3  ligase, was explored for its role in abiotic stress response in Arabidopsis  thaliana. The expression of AtPPRT1 was induced by ABA. In addition, the  beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene driven by the AtPPRT1 promoter was more active in the  root hair zone and root tips of primary and major lateral roots of young  seedlings in the presence of ABA. The assays for seed germination, stomatal  aperture, root length, and water deficit demonstrated that the  AtPPRT1-overexpressing Arabidopsis was insensitive to ABA and sensitive to  drought stress compared with wild-type (WT) plants. The analysis by quantitative  real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that the expression of three stress-inducible  genes (AtRAB18, AtERD10, and AtKIN1) were upregulated in the atpprt1 mutant and  downregulated in AtPPRT1-overexpressing plants, while two ABA hydrolysis genes  (AtCYP707A1 and AtCYP707A3) were downregulated in the atpprt1 mutant and  upregulated in AtPPRT1-overexpressing plants in the presence of ABA. AtPPRT1 was  localized in the mitochondria. Our findings indicate that AtPPRT1 plays a  negative role in ABA and drought stress responses.', '2019 Jan 17', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms20020394', 'Wang']
