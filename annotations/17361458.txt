In vitro fertilization (IVF) systems using isolated male and female gametes have been utilized to dissect fertilization-induced events in angiosperms, such as egg activation, zygote development and early embryogenesis, as the female gametophytes of plants are deeply embedded within ovaries. In this study, a rice IVF system was established to take advantage of the abundant resources stemming from rice research for investigations into the mechanisms of fertilization and early embryogenesis. Fusion of gametes was performed using a modified electrofusion method, and the fusion product, a zygote, formed cell wall and an additional nucleolus. The zygote divided into a two-celled embryo 15-24 h after fusion, and developed into a globular-like embryo consisting of an average of 15-16 cells by 48 h after fusion. Comparison of the developmental processes of zygotes produced by IVF with those of zygotes generated in planta suggested that zygotes produced by IVF develop and grow into early globular stage embryos in a highly similar manner to those in planta. Although the IVF-produced globular embryos did not develop into late globular-stage or differentiated embryos, but into irregularly shaped cell masses, fertile plants were regenerated from the cell masses and the seeds harvested from these plants germinated normally. The rice IVF system reported here will be a powerful tool for studying the molecular mechanisms involved in the early embryogenesis of angiosperms and for making new cultivars.
