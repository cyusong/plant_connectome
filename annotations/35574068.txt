Anthracnose, caused by <i>Colletotrichum truncatum</i>, leads to large-scale reduction in quality and yield in soybean production. Limited information is available regarding the molecular mechanisms of resistance to anthracnose in soybean. We conducted a transcriptomic and targeted metabolomic analysis of pods from two soybean lines, "Zhechun No. 3" (ZC3) and ZC-2, in response to <i>C. truncatum</i> infection. Factors contributing to the enhanced resistance of ZC-2 to anthracnose compared with that of ZC3, included signal transduction (jasmonic acid, auxin, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling), transcription factors (<i>WRKY</i> and <i>bHLH</i>), resistance genes (<i>PTI1</i>, <i>RPP13</i>, <i>RGA2</i>, <i>RPS6</i>, and <i>ULP2B</i>), pathogenesis-related genes (<i>chitinase</i> and <i>lipid transfer protein</i>), and terpenoid metabolism. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed that terpenoid metabolism responded more promptly and more intensely to <i>C. truncatum</i> infection in ZC-2 than in ZC3. <i>In vitro</i> antifungal activity and resistance induction test confirmed that jasmonic acid, auxin signaling and terpenoids played important roles in soybean resistance to anthracnose. This research is the first study to explore the molecular mechanisms of soybean resistance to anthracnose. The findings are important for in-depth analysis of molecular resistance mechanisms, discovery of resistance genes, and to expedite the breeding of anthracnose-resistant soybean cultivars.
