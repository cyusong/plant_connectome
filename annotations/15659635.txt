More than half a century after the discovery of transposable elements, the number of genetically defined autonomous elements that have been isolated and characterized molecularly in any one species remains surprisingly small. Because of its rich genetic history, maize (Zea mays) is, by far, the plant with the largest number of such elements. Yet, even in maize, a maximum of only two autonomous elements have been characterized in any transposon superfamily. This article describes the isolation and molecular and genetic characterization of Mx (for mobile element induced by x-rays), a third autonomous member of the hAT transposon superfamily in maize. Mx is 3731 bp long, ends in 13-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), and causes an 8-bp duplication of the target site. Mx and rMx (for responder to Mx), its 571-bp nonautonomous partner, define a classical family of interacting transposable elements. Surprisingly, the TIRs of Mx and rMx are only 73% identical, and the subterminal sequences are even less so, suggesting that Mx and rMx may represent diverging transposable elements still capable of mobilization by the same transposase. Sequences that are closer to the ends of either Mx or rMx are present in the maize genome. Mx is predicted to encode a 674-amino acid protein that is homologous to the Ac transposase. Although Mx and Ac are closely related, they do not interact. Other data suggest that maize may possess at least five families of hAT transposons that do not interact with each other. The possible origin of noninteracting transposon families within the same superfamily is discussed.
