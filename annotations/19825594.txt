['19825594', 'Four members of the tandem-pore potassium channel family of Arabidopsis thaliana  (TPK1, 2, 3, and 5) reside in the vacuolar membrane, whereas TPK4 is a plasma  membrane K(+)-channel. By constructing chimeras between TPK1 and TPK4, we  attempted to identify channel domains involved in the trafficking process and  found that the TPK1 cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CT) is critical for the ER- as  well as Golgi-sorting steps. Following site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a  diacidic motif (DLE) required for ER-export of TPK1. However, this diacidic motif  in the C-terminus is not conserved among other members of the TPK family, and  TPK3 sorting is independent of its CT. Moreover, the 14-3-3 binding site of TPK1,  essential for channel activation, is not involved in channel sorting.', '2008 Nov', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssn064', 'Hedrich']
