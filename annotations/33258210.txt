Previous studies have suggested that the plastid translation elongation factor, elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu), encoded by RAB GTPASE HOMOLOG 8D (RAB8D) is essential for plant growth. Here, through analyzing the root phenotypes of two knock-down alleles of RAB8D (rab8d-1 and rab8d-2), we further revealed a vital role for RAB8D in primary root development through the maintenance of both the stem cell niche (SCN) and the meristem. Our results showed that RAB8D deficiency affects the root auxin response and SCN maintenance signaling. RAB8D interacts with GENOMES UNCOUPLED 1 (GUN1) in vivo. Further analysis revealed that GUN1 is over-accumulated and is required for both stem cell death and maintenance of root architecture in rab8d Arabidopsis mutants. The ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA-MUTATED (ATM)-SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 pathway is involved in the regulation of root meristem size through upregulating SIAMESE-RELATED 5 expression in the rab8d-2 allele. Moreover, ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 is highly expressed in rab8d-2, which plays a role in further quiescent center division. Our observations not only characterized the role of RAB8D in root development, but also uncovered functions of GUN1 and ATM in response to plastid EF-Tu deficiency.
