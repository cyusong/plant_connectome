We report on the second phase of a programme to select a relative of Arabidopsis thaliana for use in large-scale molecular genetic studies of nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) hyperaccumulation. We also report on the relatedness among Thlaspi caerulescens accessions and the utility of using O-acetyl-L-serine as a marker for Ni and Zn hyperaccumulation potential. Twenty-seven new accessions of metal-accumulating species collected in the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Italy, Slovenia and the USA during Spring-Summer 2002 were evaluated. The criteria established for selection were hyperaccumulation of metals (Ni and Zn); compact growth habit; reasonable time to flowering; production of > or = 1000 seeds per plant; self-fertility; compact diploid genome; high sequence similarity to A. thaliana; > or = 0.1% transformation efficiency with easy selection. We conclude that the best candidate identified in the first phase was the best candidate overall: T. caerulescens accession St Félix de Pallières.
