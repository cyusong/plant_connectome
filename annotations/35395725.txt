Many biological processes follow circadian rhythmicity and are controlled by the circadian clock. Predictable environmental changes such as seasonal variation in photoperiod can modulate circadian rhythms, allowing organisms to adjust the timing of their biological processes to the time of the year. In some crops such as rice, barley or soybean, mutations in circadian clock genes have altered photoperiod sensitivity, enhancing their cultivability in specific seasons and latitudes. However, how changes in circadian rhythms interact with the perception of photoperiod in crops remain poorly studied. In tomato, the appearance during domestication of mutations in EMPFINDLICHER IM DUNKELROTEN LICHT 1 (EID1, Solyc09g075080) and NIGHT LIGHT-INDUCIBLE AND CLOCK-REGULATED GENE 2 (LNK2, Solyc01g068560) delayed both the phase and period of its circadian rhythms. The fact that variation in period and phase are separated in tomato provides an optimal tool to study how these factors affect the perception of photoperiod. Here we develop tomato near isogenic lines carrying combinations of wild alleles of EID1 and LNK2 and show that they recreate the changes in phase and period that occurred during its domestication. We perform transcriptomic profiling of these near isogenic lines under two different photoperiods, and observe that EID1, but not LNK2, has a large effect on how the tomato transcriptome responds to photoperiod. This large effect of EID1 is likely a consequence of the global phase shift elicited by this gene in tomato's circadian rhythms. Our study shows that changes in phase that occurred during tomato domestication determine photoperiod perception in this species, while changes in period have little effect.
