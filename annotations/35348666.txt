Covalent modification of histones is an important tool for gene transcriptional control in eukaryotes, which coordinates growth, development, and adaptation to environmental changes. In recent years, an important role for monoubiquitination of histone 2B (H2B) has emerged in plants, where it is associated with transcriptional activation. In this review, we discuss the dynamics of the H2B monoubiquitination system in plants and its role in regulating developmental processes including flowering, circadian rhythm, photomorphogenesis, and the response to abiotic and biotic stress including drought, salinity, and fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens. Furthermore, we highlight the crosstalk between H2B monoubiquitination and other histone modifications which fine-tunes transcription and ensures developmental plasticity. Finally, we put into perspective how this versatile regulatory mechanism can be developed as a useful tool for crop improvement.
