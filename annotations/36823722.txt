Seedlings of the parasitic plant genus Cuscuta (dodder) locate hosts by circumnutation, coil around the host near soil level and form a haustorium, establishing a primary parasitism beneath the canopy. Mature shoots elongating from the parasitic region parasitize other hosts on the upper surfaces of their canopy. Although parasitism by dodder is stimulated by blue and far-red light, and inhibited by red light, the responses to light signals during the developmental stages are not comprehensively understood. Therefore, we compared the effects of different types of light on both circumnutation and parasitism by germinating seedlings and mature shoots of Cuscuta campestris. Seedlings established parasitism under blue and far-red light, but not under red light, as has been reported repeatedly. By contrast, mature shoots exhibited coiling around the host and haustoria formation even under a red light as well as under blue and far-red light. These findings indicate that C. campestris modified its response to red light during the transition from young seedlings to mature shoots, facilitating parasitism. Light quality did not affect the circumnutation of either seedlings or mature shoots, indicating that circumnutation and the coiling movement that leads to parasitism were regulated by different environmental signals.

Seedlings: !inhibited by! red light
Mature shoots: !respond to! red, blue and far-red light
Circumnutation: !unaffected by! light quality
Parasitism: !facilitated by! transition from seedling to mature shoot
