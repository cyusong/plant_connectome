['28408602', 'Controlling cell division plane orientation is essential for morphogenesis in  multicellular organisms. In plant cells, the future cortical division plane is  marked before mitotic entry by the preprophase band (PPB). Here, we characterized  an Arabidopsis trm (TON1 Recruiting Motif) mutant that impairs PPB formation but  does not affect interphase microtubules. Unexpectedly, PPB disruption neither  abolished the capacity of root cells to define a cortical division zone nor  induced aberrant cell division patterns but rather caused a loss of precision in  cell division orientation. Our results advocate for a reassessment of PPB  function and division plane determination in plants and show that a main output  of this microtubule array is to limit spindle rotations in order to increase the  robustness of cell division.', '2017 Apr 14', 'Science', '10.1126/science.aal3016', 'ORCID:']
