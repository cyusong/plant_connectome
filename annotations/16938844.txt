['16938844', 'The Arabidopsis HOBBIT (HBT) gene encodes a homolog of the CDC27  anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome subunit and is essential for postembryonic  development. We induced loss-of-function clones by Cre/lox-mediated recombination  of a single complementing HBT transgene in a background homozygous for the strong  mutant allele hbt(2311). Defects in cell division and cell expansion are the  primary consequences of ubiquitous postembryonic HBT excision. In roots, both  cell division and cell expansion are rapidly affected. In contrast, in leaf  primordia, cell division and cell expansion halt after a lag phase, which results  in different severities of defects in the proximodistal and mediolateral axes.  Surprisingly, small clones reveal non-cell-autonomous rescue of hbt mutant cells,  indicating a previously unrecognized compensation mechanism for reduced activity  of an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome component critical for cell cycle  progression.', '2006 Aug 29', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0602410103', 'Scheres']
