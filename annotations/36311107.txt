Flowering is the most studied ornamental trait in orchids where long vegetative phase may span up to three years. Cymbidium orchids produce beautiful flowers with astonishing shapes and pleasant scent. However, an unusually long vegetative phase is a major drawback to their ornamental value. We observed that under certain culture conditions, three cymbidium species (<i>Cymbidium ensifolium</i>, <i>C. goeringii</i> and <i>C. sinense</i>) skipped vegetative growth phase and directly flowered within six months, that could be a breakthrough for future orchids with limited vegetative growth. Hormonal and floral regulators could be the key factors arresting vegetative phase. Therefore, transcriptomic analyses were performed for leafless flowers and normal vegetative leaves to ascertain differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to hormones (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin, abscisic acid and ethylene), floral integrators and MADS-box genes. A significant difference of cytokinin and floral regulators was observed among three species as compared to other hormones. The MADS-box genes were significantly expressed in the leafless flowers of <i>C. sinense</i> as compared to other species. Among the key floral regulators, <i>CONSTANS</i> and <i>AGAMOUS</i>-like genes showed the most differential expression in the leafless flowers as compared to leaves where the expression was negligible. However, <i>CONSTANS</i> also showed downregulation. Auxin efflux carriers were mainly downregulated in the leafless flowers of <i>C. ensifolium</i> and <i>C. sinense</i>, while they were upregulated in <i>C. goeringii</i>. Moreover, gibberellin and cytokinin genes were also downregulated in <i>C. ensifolium</i> and <i>C. sinense</i> flowers, while they were upregulated in <i>C. goeringii</i>, suggesting that species may vary in their responses. The data mining thus, outsources the valuable information to direct future research on orchids at industrial levels.
