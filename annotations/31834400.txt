Reversible protein phosphorylation orchestrated by protein kinases and phosphatases is a major regulatory event in plants and animals. The SnRK2 subfamily consists of plant-specific protein kinases in the Ser/Thr protein kinase superfamily. Early observations indicated that SnRK2s are mainly involved in response to abiotic stress. Recent evidence shows that SnRK2s are multifarious players in a variety of biological processes. Here, we summarize the considerable knowledge of SnRK2s, including evolution, classification, biological functions and regulatory mechanisms at the epigenetic, post-transcriptional and post-translation levels.
