Convergent evolution of shoot development across plant lineages has prompted numerous comparative genetic studies. Though functional conservation of gene networks governing flowering plant shoot development has been explored in bryophyte gametophore development, the role of bryophyte-specific genes remains unknown. Previously, we have reported Tnt1 insertional mutants of moss defective in gametophore development. Here, we report a mutant (short-leaf; shlf) having two-fold shorter leaves, reduced apical dominance, and low plasmodesmata frequency. UHPLC-MS/MS-based auxin quantification and analysis of soybean (Glycine max) auxin-responsive promoter (GH3:GUS) lines exhibited a striking differential auxin distribution pattern in the mutant gametophore. Whole-genome sequencing and functional characterization of candidate genes revealed that a novel bryophyte-specific gene (SHORT-LEAF; SHLF) is responsible for the shlf phenotype. SHLF represents a unique family of near-perfect tandem direct repeat (TDR)-containing proteins conserved only among mosses and liverworts, as evident from our phylogenetic analysis. Cross-complementation with a Marchantia homolog partially recovered the shlf phenotype, indicating possible functional specialization. The distinctive structure (longest known TDRs), absence of any known conserved domain, localization in the endoplasmic reticulum, and proteolytic cleavage pattern of SHLF imply its function in bryophyte-specific cellular mechanisms. This makes SHLF a potential candidate to study gametophore development and evolutionary adaptations of early land plants.
