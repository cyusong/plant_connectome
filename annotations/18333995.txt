The ER fraction from red beet taproot was purified on sucrose gradient and giant liposomes, suitable for patch clamping, were formed by dehydration-rehydration of the lipid film. Single-channel recordings on excised and attached patches revealed a large conductance (165 pS) cation (P(Cl-)/P(K+) < 0.03) channel with equal conductance and relative permeability for Na+ and K+. This non-selective cation channel was also highly permeable for Ca2+. We failed to detect any single-channel currents activated by a direct application of d-myo-inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate, despite the fact that the ER membranes were native.
