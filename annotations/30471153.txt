The STAY-GREEN (SGR) gene encodes Mg-dechelatase which catalyzes the conversion of chlorophyll (Chl) a to pheophytin (Pheo) a. This reaction is the first and most important regulatory step in the Chl degradation pathway. Conversely, Pheo a is an indispensable molecule in photosystem (PS) II, suggesting the involvement of SGR in the formation of PSII. To investigate the physiological functions of SGR, we isolated Chlamydomonas sgr mutants by screening an insertion-mutant library. The sgr mutants had reduced maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (F<sub>v</sub> /F<sub>m</sub> ) and reduced Pheo a levels. These phenotypes were complemented by the introduction of the Chlamydomonas SGR gene. Blue Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis showed that although PSII levels were reduced in the sgr mutants, PSI and light-harvesting Chl a/b complex levels were unaffected. Under nitrogen starvation conditions, Chl degradation proceeded in the sgr mutants as in the wild type, indicating that ChlamydomonasSGR is not required for Chl degradation and primarily contributes to the formation of PSII. In contrast, in the Arabidopsis sgr triple mutant (sgr1 sgr2 sgrL), which completely lacks SGR activity, PSII was synthesized normally. These results suggest that the Arabidopsis SGR participates in Chl degradation while the ChlamydomonasSGR participates in PSII formation despite having the same catalytic property.
