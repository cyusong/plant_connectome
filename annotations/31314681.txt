INDETERMINATE-DOMAIN proteins (IDDs) belong to a diverse plant-specific family of transcriptional regulators that coordinate distinct functions during plant growth and development. The functions of several of these IDD members are transcriptionally regulated, but so far nothing is known about the regulation at the post-translational level in spite of the fact that post-translational modifications of these proteins have been reported in several large-scale proteomics studies. Recently, we showed that IDD4 is a repressor of basal immunity and its characteristic traits are predominantly determined by the phosphorylation at two distinct phosphorylation sites. This finding prompted us to comprehensively review phosphorylation of the various IDD members from the plethora of phosphoproteomics studies demonstrating the post-translational modification of IDDs at highly conserved sites under various experimental conditions. We reckon that the phosphorylation of IDDs is an underrated mechanistic aspect in their regulation and we postulate their importance in IDD/BIRD functioning.
