['9550714', 'Bundle sheath cells form a sheath around the entire vascular tissue in  Arabidopsis leaves and constitute a distinct leaf cell type, as defined by their  elongate morphology, their position adjacent to the vein and by differences in  their chloroplast development compared to mesophyll cells. They constitute about  15% of chloroplast-containing cells in the leaf. In order to identify genes which  play a role in the differential development of bundle sheath and mesophyll cell  chloroplasts, a screen of reticulate leaf mutants of Arabidopsis was used to  identify a new class of mutants termed dov (differential development of  vascular-associated cells). The dov1 mutant clearly demonstrates a cell-specific  difference in chloroplast development. Mutant leaves are highly reticulate with a  green vascular pattern. The underlying bundle sheath cells always contain normal  chloroplasts, whereas chloroplasts in mesophyll cells are abnormal, reduced in  number per cell and seriously perturbed in morphology at the ultrastructural  level. This demonstrates that differential chloroplast development occurs between  the bundle sheath and mesophyll cells in the Arabidopsis leaf.', '1998 May', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.125.10.1815', 'Pyke']
