Brassinosteroid hormones (BRs) multitask to smoothly regulate a broad spectrum of vital physiological processes in plants, such as cell division, cell expansion, differentiation, seed germination, xylem differentiation, reproductive development and light responses (photomorphogenesis and skotomorphogenesis). Their importance is inferred when visible abnormalities arise in plant phenotypes due to suboptimal or supraoptimal hormone levels. This group of steroidal hormones are major growth regulators, having pleiotropic effects and conferring abiotic stress resistance to plants. Numerous abiotic stresses are the cause of significant loss in agricultural yield globally. However, plants are well equipped with efficient stress combat machinery. Scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a unique mechanism to combat the deleterious effects of abiotic stresses. In light of numerous reports in the past two decades, the complex BR signaling under different stress conditions (drought, salinity, extreme temperatures and heavy metals/metalloids) that drastically hinders the normal metabolism of plants is gradually being untangled and revealed. Thus, crop improvement has substantial potential by tailoring either the brassinosteroid signaling, biosynthesis pathway or perception. This review aims to explore and dissect the actual mission of BRs in signaling cascades and summarize their positive role with respect to abiotic stress tolerance.
