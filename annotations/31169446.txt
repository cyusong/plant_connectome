Since NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is one of the most important limiting nitrogen sources for plant growth, ammonium uptake and transport system has particular attention. In plant cells, ammonium transporters (AMTs) are responsible for ammonium uptake and transport. In previous studies, we identified a <i>PutAMT1;1</i> gene from <i>Puccinellia tenuiflora</i>, which is a monocotyledonous halophyte species that thrives in alkaline soil. The overexpression of <i>PutAMT1;1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> enhanced plant growth and increased plant susceptibility to toxic methylammonium (MeA). This transporter might be useful for improving the root to shoot mobilization of MeA (or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>). Interestingly, in our other studies, it can be assumed that urease acts on urea to produce NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, which may exacerbate salt stress. Overexpression of <i>PutAMT1;1</i> promoted early root growth after seed germination in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> under salt stress condition. These findings suggest that ammonium transport alleviates ammonia toxicity caused by salt stress. Subcellular localization revealed that PutAMT1;1 is mainly localized in the plasma membrane and the nuclear periphery and endomembrane system of yeast and plant cells. Here, we discuss these recent findings and speculate on the regular dynamic localization of PutAMT1;1 throughout the cell cycle, which may be related to intracellular activity.
