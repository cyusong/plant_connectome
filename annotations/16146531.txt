Although several induction systems have been described for plants containing transgenes in the nucleus, to date there is only one method for controlling transgene expression in plastids. This consists of chemical induction of a nuclear gene and import of the gene product into plastids, so that transformation of two cellular compartments is required. Here we describe a system for external control of plastid gene expression which is based entirely on plastid components and can therefore be established in a single transformation step. Our system uses modified promoters containing binding sites for the bacterial lac repressor. Chemical induction can be made with intact plants or after harvesting, which provides ecological and economic benefits.
