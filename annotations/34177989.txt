Legume plants are rich in prenylated flavonoid compounds, which play an important role in plant defense and human health. In the present study, we identified a prenyltransferase (PT) gene, named <i>LaPT2</i>, in white lupin (<i>Lupinus albus</i>), which shows a high identity and close relationship with the other known PT genes involved in flavonoid prenylation in planta. The recombinant LaPT2 protein expressed in yeast cells exhibited a relatively strong activity toward several flavonols (e.g., kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin) and a relatively weak activity toward flavanone (naringenin). In addition, the recombinant LaPT2 protein was also active toward several other types of flavonoids, including galangin, morin, 5-deoxyquercetin, 4'-O-methylkaempferol, taxifolin, and aromadendrin, with distinct enzymatic affinities. The <i>LaPT2</i> gene was preferentially expressed in the roots, which is consistent with the presence of prenylated flavonoid kaempferol in the roots. Moreover, we found that the expression level of <i>LaPT2</i> paralleled with those of <i>LaF3H1</i> and <i>LaFLS2</i> genes that were relatively higher in roots and lower in leaves, suggesting that they were essential for the accumulation of prenylated flavonoid kaempferol in roots. The deduced full-length LaPT2 protein and its signal peptide fused with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) are targeted to plastids in the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> protoplast. Our study demonstrated that <i>LaPT2</i> from white lupin is responsible for the biosynthesis of prenylated flavonoids, in particular flavonols, which could be utilized as phytoalexin for plant defense and bioactive flavonoid compounds for human health.
