Understanding of plant-pathogen coevolution in natural systems continues to develop as new theories at the population and species level are increasingly informed by studies unraveling the molecular basis of interactions between individual plants and their pathogens. The next challenge lies in further integration of these approaches to develop a comprehensive picture of how life history traits of both players interact with the environment to shape evolutionary trajectories.
