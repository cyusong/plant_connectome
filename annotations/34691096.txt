Most epiphytes are found in low-nutrient environments with an intermittent water supply. To deal with water limitation, many bromeliads perform crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), such as <i>Guzmania monostachia</i>, which shifts from C<sub>3</sub> to CAM and can recycle CO<sub>2</sub> from the respiration while stomata remain closed during daytime and nighttime (CAM-idling mode). Since the absorbing leaf trichomes can be in contact with organic (urea) and inorganic nutrients (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>) and the urea hydrolysis releases NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and CO<sub>2</sub>, we hypothesized that urea can integrate the N and C metabolism during periods of severe drought. Under this condition, NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> can be assimilated into amino acids through glutamine synthetase (GS), while the CO<sub>2</sub> can be pre-fixated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). In this context, we evaluated the foliar transcriptome of <i>G. monostachia</i> to compare the relative gene expression of some genes involved with CAM and the N metabolism when bromeliads were submitted to 7days of drought. We also conducted a controlled experiment with an extended water deficit period (21days) in which bromeliads were cultivated in different N sources (urea, NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup>, and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>). Our transcriptome results demonstrated an increment in the expression of genes related to CAM, particularly those involved in the carboxylation metabolism (<i>PEPC1</i>, <i>PPCK</i>, and <i>NAD-MDH</i>), the movement of malate through vacuolar membrane (<i>ALMT9</i>), and the decarboxylation process (<i>PEPCK</i>). Urea stimulated the expression of <i>PEPC1</i> and <i>ALMT9</i>, while <i>Urease</i> transcripts increased under water deficit. Under this same condition, <i>GS1</i> gene expression increased, indicating that the NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> from urea hydrolysis can be assimilated in the cytosol. We suggest that the link between C and N metabolism occurred through the supply of carbon skeleton (2-oxoglutarate, 2-OG) by the cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase since the number of <i>NADP</i>-<i>ICDH</i> transcripts was also higher under drought conditions. These findings indicate that while urea hydrolysis provides NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> that can be consumed by glutamine synthetase-cytosolic/glutamate synthase (GS1/GOGAT) cycle, the CO<sub>2</sub> can be used by CAM, maintaining photosynthetic efficiency even when most stomata remain closed 24h (CAM-idling) as in the case of a severe water deficit condition. Thus, we suggest that urea could be used by <i>G. monostachia</i> as a strategy to increase its survival under drought, integrating N and C metabolism.
