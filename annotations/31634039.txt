Rice sheath blight, caused by the necrotrophic fungus <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> Kühn, continues to be an important and challenging rice disease worldwide. Here, we used genome-wide association studies over a high-density rice array to facilitate the identification of potential novel genes and quantitative trait loci related to sheath blight resistance. We identified multiple regions that significantly associated with independent disease components in chromosomes 1, 4, and 11 under controlled condition. In particular, we investigated <i>qLN11</i><sup><i>28</i></sup>, a quantitative trait locus enriched with defense-related genes that reduce disease lesions in a near-isogenic line. RNA profiling of the line carrying <i>qLN11</i><sup><i>28</i></sup> showed a number of differentially expressed genes related to the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-redox pathway. Histochemical staining revealed less ROS accumulation on the resistant line, suggesting efficient ROS deregulation that delays pathogen colonization. The detection of genomic regions controlling multiple mechanisms of resistance to sheath blight will provide tools to design effective breeding interventions in rice.
