['10998191', 'In plants, light is not only an energy source but also a very important signal  that modulates development and differentiation. Here, we report a putative  photo-regulatory factor sequence in LKP1 (LOV kelch protein 1). LKP1 cDNA encodes  a protein of 610 amino acids and with a molecular weight of 65 905 with an LOV  domain and kelch repeats. LOV domains are present in a number of sensor proteins  involved in the detection of light, oxygen or voltage. The LKP1 LOV is very  similar to the LOV domains in NPH1, a plasma membrane-associated blue light  receptor kinase that regulates phototropism (Huala, E., Oeller, P.W., Liscum, E.,  Han, I-S., Larsen, E. & Briggs, W.R. (1997) Science, 278, 2120-2123). LKP1 mRNA  accumulates in roots, stems, flowers and siliques. It is most abundant in leaves,  and least abundant in seeds. Transgenic plants with a beta-glucuronidase (GUS)  reporter gene driven by a 1.5 kb LKP1 promoter display strong GUS activity in  leaves. Transgenic plants with a 35S:LKP1 cDNA gene overexpress LKP1 mRNA. These  plants have elongated hypocotyls and petioles with elongated cells, and exhibit  distinct cotyledon movement during the day. Expression of 35S:LKP1 in transgenic  Arabidopsis promotes late flowering in plants grown under long-day, but not under  short-day conditions. Vernalization does not affect the late flowering phenotype  of the 35S:LKP1 plants. Transgenic plants possessing the 35S:GFP-LKP1 construct  also have long hypocotyles and petioles, and a late flowering phenotype,  suggesting that the GFP-LKP1 fusion protein is active. The GFP-associated  fluorescence in 35S:GFP-LKP1 plants is observed in nuclei and cytosol, indicating  that LKP1 is a new nucleo-cytoplasmic factor that influences flowering time in  the long day pathway of Arabidopsis.', '2000 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00850.x', 'Wada']
