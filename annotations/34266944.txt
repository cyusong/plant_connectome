Plant architecture is an important agronomic trait that affects crop yield. Here, we report that a gene involved in programmed cell death, <i>OsPDCD5</i>, negatively regulates plant architecture and grain yield in rice. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce loss-of-function mutations into <i>OsPDCD5</i> in 11 rice cultivars. Targeted mutagenesis of <i>OsPDCD5</i> enhanced grain yield and improved plant architecture by increasing plant height and optimizing panicle type and grain shape. Transcriptome analysis showed that <i>OsPDCD5</i> knockout affected auxin biosynthesis, as well as the gibberellin and cytokinin biosynthesis and signaling pathways. OsPDCD5 interacted directly with OsAGAP, and <i>OsAGAP</i> positively regulated plant architecture and grain yield in rice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that <i>OsPDCD5</i> is a promising candidate gene for breeding super rice cultivars with increased yield potential and superior quality.
