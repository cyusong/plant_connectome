Plant survival in many ecosystems requires tolerance of large radiation loads, unreliable water supply and suboptimal soil fertility. We hypothesized that increased production of neutral lipids (triacylglycerols, TAGs) in plant leaves is a mechanism for dissipating excess radiation energy. In a greenhouse experiment, we combined drought and shade treatments and examined responses among four species differing in life form, habitat, and drought- and shade-tolerance. We also present a lipid extraction protocol suitable for sclerophyllous leaves of native Australian trees (e.g. Acacia, Eucalyptus). Fluorescence measurements indicated that plants exposed to full sunlight experienced mild photoinhibition during our experiment. Accumulation of TAGs did not follow photosynthetic capacity, but instead, TAG concentration increased with non-photochemical quenching. This suggests that plants under oxidative stress may increase biosynthesis of TAGs. Moderate drought stress resulted in a 60% reduction in TAG concentration in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Shading had no effect on TAGs, but increased concentrations of polar lipids in leaves; for example, acclimation to shade in Austrodanthonia spp., a native Australian grass, resulted in a 60% increase in associated polar lipids and higher foliar chlorophyll concentrations. Shading also reduced the digalactosyldiacylglycerol:monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG:MGDG) ratio in leaves, with a corresponding increase in the degree of unsaturation and thus fluidity of thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. Our results suggest that prevention of photodamage may be coordinated with accumulation of TAGs, although further research is required to determine if TAGs serve a photoprotective function in plant leaves.
