['17496121', 'CYP703 is a cytochrome P450 family specific to land plants. Typically, each plant  species contains a single CYP703. Arabidopsis thaliana CYP703A2 is expressed in  the anthers of developing flowers. Expression is initiated at the tetrad stage  and restricted to microspores and to the tapetum cell layer. Arabidopsis CYP703A2  knockout lines showed impaired pollen development and a partial male-sterile  phenotype. Scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy of pollen from  the knockout plants showed impaired pollen wall development with absence of  exine. The fluorescent layer around the pollen grains ascribed to the presence of  phenylpropanoid units in sporopollenin was absent in the CYP703A2 knockout lines.  Heterologous expression of CYP703A2 in yeast cells demonstrated that CYP703  catalyzes the conversion of medium-chain saturated fatty acids to the  corresponding monohydroxylated fatty acids, with a preferential hydroxylation of  lauric acid at the C-7 position. Incubation of recombinant CYP703 with methanol  extracts from developing flowers confirmed that lauric acid and in-chain hydroxy  lauric acids are the in planta substrate and product, respectively. These data  demonstrate that in-chain hydroxy lauric acids are essential building blocks in  sporopollenin synthesis and enable the formation of ester and ether linkages with  phenylpropanoid units. This study identifies CYP703 as a P450 family specifically  involved in pollen development.', '2007 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.045948', 'Bak']
