Peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activities were analyzed in non-regenerative transformed embryogenic lines of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) carrying wound-inducible oryzacystatin I (OC-I), wound-inducible oryzacystatin I antisense (OC-Ias), or hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) genes. All of the transformed lines analyzed had elevated levels of all POD isoforms. Three POD isoforms with pI values of approximately 4.5, 4.8, and 8.4, and one additional pair of isoforms with a pI value of approximately 8.8 were separated from tissue extracts of all transgenic lines. Isoelectrofocusing patterns revealed the induction of one isoform of SOD with a pI of about 5.6 in all transgenic lines compared with non-transformed embryogenic tissue. These results indicate that the process of transformation may disrupt redox homeostasis in alfalfa tissues.
