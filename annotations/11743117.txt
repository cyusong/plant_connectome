['11743117', 'To identify factors that are required for proper pollen wall formation, we have  characterized the T-DNA-tagged, dex1 mutation of Arabidopsis, which results in  defective pollen wall pattern formation. This study reports the isolation and  molecular characterization of DEX1 and morphological and ultrastructural analyses  of dex1 plants. DEX1 encodes a novel plant protein that is predicted to be  membrane associated and contains several potential calcium-binding domains.  Pollen wall development in dex1 plants parallels that of wild-type plants until  the early tetrad stage. In dex1 plants, primexine deposition is delayed and  significantly reduced. The normal rippling of the plasma membrane and production  of spacers observed in wild-type plants is also absent in the mutant.  Sporopollenin is produced and randomly deposited on the plasma membrane in dex1  plants. However, it does not appear to be anchored to the microspore and forms  large aggregates on the developing microspore and the locule walls. Based on the  structure of DEX1 and the phenotype of dex1 plants, several potential roles for  the protein are proposed.', '2001 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '6959', 'Makaroff']
