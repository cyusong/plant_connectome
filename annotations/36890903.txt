Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve as crucial regulators in plant response to various diseases, while none have been systematically identified and characterized in response to citrus Huanglongbing (HLB) caused by <i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus (<i>C</i>Las) bacteria. Here, we comprehensively investigated the transcriptional and regulatory dynamics of the lncRNAs in response to <i>C</i>L<i>as</i>. Samples were collected from leaf midribs of <i>C</i>Las- and mock-inoculated HLB-tolerant rough lemon (<i>Citrus jambhiri</i>) and HLB-sensitive sweet orange (<i>C. sinensis</i>) at week 0, 7, 17, and 34 following inoculation using <i>C</i>Las+ budwood of three biological replicates in the greenhouse. A total of 8,742 lncRNAs, including 2,529 novel lncRNAs, were identified from RNA-seq data with rRNA-removed from strand-specific libraries. Genomic variation analyses of conserved lncRNAs from 38 citrus accessions showed that 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were significantly correlated with HLB. In addition, lncRNA-mRNA weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) showed a significant module correlated with <i>C</i>Las-inoculation in rough lemon. Notably, the most significant <i>LNC_28805</i> and multiple co-expressed genes related to plant defense in the module were targeted by <i>miRNA5021</i>, suggesting that <i>LNC28805</i> might compete with endogenous <i>miR5021</i> to maintain the homeostasis of immune gene expression levels. Candidate <i>WRKY33</i> and <i>SYP121</i> genes targeted by <i>miRNA5021</i> were identified as two key hub genes interacting with bacteria pathogen response genes based on the prediction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. These two genes were also found within HLB-associated QTL in linkage group 6. Overall, our findings provide a reference for a better understanding of the role of lncRNAs involved in citrus HLB regulation.
