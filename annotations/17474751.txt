['17474751', 'An oxidosqualene cyclase from Arabidopsis thaliana makes arabidiol, a tricyclic  triterpene reported with indeterminate side-chain stereochemistry. We established  the full structure of arabidiol through chemical degradation, NOE experiments,  and molecular modeling. By examining the mechanistic constraints that govern  water addition in triterpene synthesis, we further show how the stereochemistry  of hydroxylation can generally be deduced a priori, why deprotonation is more  common than hydroxylation, and why cyclases that perform hydroxylation also  generate olefinic byproducts.', '2007 May 24', 'Org Lett', '10.1021/ol070709b', 'Matsuda']
