In Arabidopsis, expression of FLC and FLC-related genes (collectively called FLC clade) contributes to flowering time in response to environmental changes, such as day length and temperature, by acting as floral repressors. VIN3 is required for vernalization-mediated FLC repression and a VIN3 related protein, VIN3-LIKE 1/VERNALIZATION 5 (VIL1/VRN5), acts to regulate FLC and FLM in response to vernalization. VIN3 also exists as a small family of PHD finger proteins in Arabidopsis, including VIL1/VRN5, VIL2/VEL1, VIL3/VEL2, and VIL4/VEL3. We showed that the PHD finger protein, VIL2, is required for proper repression of MAF5, an FLC clade member, to accelerate flowering under non-inductive photoperiods. VIL2 acts together with POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2) to repress MAF5 in a photoperiod dependent manner.
