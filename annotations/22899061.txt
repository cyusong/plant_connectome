Plants have evolved complex signaling networks to respond to their fluctuating environment and adapt their growth and development. Calcium-dependent signaling pathways play key role in the onset of these adaptive responses. In plant cells, the intracellular calcium transients are triggered by numerous stimuli and it is supposed that the large repertory of calcium sensors present in higher plants could contribute to integrate these signals in physiological responses. Here, we present data on CML9, a calmodulin-like protein that appears to be involved in plant responses to both biotic and abiotic stress. Using a reverse genetic approach based on gain and loss of function mutants, we present here data indicating that this CML might also be involved in root growth control in response to the flagellin, a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) also involved in plant immunity.
