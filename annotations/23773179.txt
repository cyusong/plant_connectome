During plant development, the frequency and context of cell division must be controlled, and cells must differentiate properly to perform their mature functions. In addition, stem cell niches need to be maintained as a reservoir for new cells. All of these processes require intercellular signaling, whether it is a cell relaying its position to other cells, or more mature cells signaling to the stem cell niche to regulate the rate of growth. Receptor-like kinases have emerged as a major component in these diverse roles, especially within the Arabidopsis root. In this review, the functions of receptor-like kinase signaling in regulating Arabidopsis root development will be examined in the areas of root apical meristem maintenance, regulation of epidermal cell fate, lateral root development and vascular differentiation.
