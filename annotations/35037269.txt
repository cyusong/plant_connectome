Epigenetic regulation is necessary for optimal organism development and preservation of gene expression profiles in the cell. In plants, the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is a silencing epigenetic mark relevant for developmental transitions like flowering. The floral transition is a key agronomic trait; however, the epigenetic mechanisms of flowering time regulation in crops remain poorly understood. Here we study the Jumonji H3K27me3 demethylases BraA.REF6 and BraA.ELF6 in Brassica rapa. Phenotypic characterization of novel mutant lines and genome-wide H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptomic analyses indicated that BraA.REF6 plays a greater role than BraA.ELF6 in fine-tuning H3K27me3 levels. In addition, we found that braA.elf6 mutants were early flowering due to high H3K27me3 levels at B. rapa homologs of the floral repressor FLC. Unlike mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana, braA.ref6 mutants were late flowering without altering the expression of B. rapa FLC genes. Remarkably, we found that BraA.REF6 regulated a number of gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthetic genes, including a homolog of GA1, and that GA-treatment complemented the late flowering mutant phenotype. This study increases our understanding of the epigenetic regulation of flowering time in B. rapa, highlighting conserved and distinct regulatory mechanisms between model and crop species.
