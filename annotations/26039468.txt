Gibberellin (GA) plays important roles through plant growth and development. However, where GA is synthesized inside a cell and how it regulates sex determination is obscure. We analyzed the classic dwarf1 (d1) mutant in maize and revealed that D1 encodes GA 3-oxidase converting inactive GA intermediates to bioactive GA. As such, the D1 protein marks the sites where GA is potentially synthesized. Interestingly, the D1 protein was found to localize in the cytosol and nucleus, a dual-localization coinciding with the GA receptor. The same result was found for GA 20-oxidase catalyzing the upstream reaction. These results suggest that GA can be synthesized in the cytosol and nucleus. The D1 protein was highly and specifically expressed in the stamen primordia in the ear florets, but low in the whole tassel. Hence it is possible that low level of GA in the tassel is insufficient to suppress stamen development. As jasmonic acid (JA) plays antagonistic role to GA in the tassel florets, here we propose a model to explain this antagonism effect on the regulation of the stamen and pistil organ development in the tassel florets in maize.
