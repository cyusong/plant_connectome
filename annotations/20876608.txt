Yeast elicitor (YEL) induces stomatal closure. We investigated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, nitric oxide (NO) production and [Ca(2+)](cyt) oscillations to clarify YEL signaling in Arabidopsis guard cells. YEL induced ROS accumulation in guard cells. A peroxidase inhibitor [salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM)] inhibited the stomatal closure and the ROS accumulation, but neither the atrbohD atrbohF mutation nor an NADPH oxidase inhibitor [diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI)] had any effect. An NO scavenger [2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO)] inhibited the YEL-induced stomatal closure and SHAM abolished NO production. YEL-elicited [Ca(2+)](cyt) oscillations were inhibited by SHAM but not by the atrbohD atrbohF mutation. These results indicate that YEL induces stomatal closure accompanied by ROS production mediated by peroxidases and NO production.
