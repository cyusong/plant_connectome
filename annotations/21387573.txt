['21387573', 'Past phylogenic studies have identified a plant-specific, ungrouped family of  kinesins in which the motor domain does not group to one of the fourteen  recognized families. Members of this family contain an N-terminal motor domain, a  C-terminal armadillo repeat domain and a conserved destruction box (D-BOX) motif.  This domain architecture is unique to plants and to a subset of protists. Further  characterization of one representative member from Arabidopsis, Arabidopsis  thaliana KINESIN ungrouped clade, gene A (AtKINUa), was completed to ascertain  its functional role in plants. Fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed an  accumulation of ATKINUA:GFP at the preprophase band (PPB) in a cell  cycle-dependent manner in Arabidopsis epidermal cells and tobacco BY-2 cells.  Fluorescence accumulation was highest during prophase and decreased after nuclear  envelope breakdown. A conserved D-BOX motif was identified through alignment of  AtKINU homologous sequences. Mutagenesis work with D-BOX revealed that conserved  residues were necessary for the observed degradation pattern of ATKINUA:GFP, as  well as the targeted accumulation at the PPB. Overall results suggest that  AtKINUa is necessary for normal plant growth and/or development and is likely  involved with PPB organization through microtubule association and specific cell  cycle regulation. The D-BOX motif may function to bridge microtubule organization  with changes that occur during progression through mitosis and may represent a  novel regulatory motif in plant microtubule motor proteins.', '2011 Apr', 'Cytoskeleton (Hoboken)', '10.1002/cm.20508', 'Cyr']
