Perennial ryegrass (<i>Lolium perenne</i>) is a temperate grass species commonly used as pasture for livestock. Flowering (heading) of ryegrass impacts metabolizable energy content and seed yield, therefore this trait is important for both farmers and seed producers. In related grass species, the <i>VRN</i> genes (<i>VRN1</i>-<i>3</i>) have been largely implicated in the determination of vernalization response and are responsible for much of the intra-species variation in this trait. Many other important flowering-time regulators have been cataloged in the model grass <i>Brachypodium distachyon;</i> however, in several cases, such as <i>VRN2</i>, their ryegrass homologs have not been well-characterized. Here, ryegrass homologs of important flowering time genes from <i>B. distachyon</i> were identified through available synteny data and sequence similarity. Phylogenetic analysis of <i>VRN3/FT-like</i> and <i>VRN2-like</i> genes was performed to elucidate these families further. The expression patterns of these genes were assessed during vernalization. This confirmed the key roles played by <i>LpVRN1</i> and <i>LpFT3</i> in the promotion of flowering. Furthermore, two orthologs of <i>VRN2</i> identified here, as well as an ortholog of <i>CO9</i>, were expressed prior to vernalization, and were repressed in flowering plants, suggesting a role in floral repression. Significant variability in expression of these flowering pathway genes in diverse genotypes was detected and may underlie variation in flowering time and vernalization response.
