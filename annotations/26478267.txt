['26478267', 'During anther development the male gametophyte develops inside the locule and the  tapetal cells provide all nutrients for its development. Magnesium Transporter 5  (MGT5) is a member of the MGT family and has dual functions of Mg export and  import. Here, we show that male gametophyte mitosis and intine formation are  defective in a mgt5 mutant. The transient expression of GFP-MGT5 revealed that  MGT5 is localized in the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that in the male  gametophyte MGT5 plays a role in importing Mg from the locule and that Mg is  essential for male gametophyte development. The expression of MGT5 in the  knockout ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS) mutant (AMS being an essential regulator of  tapetum) is tremendously reduced. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and mobility  shift assay experiments demonstrated that AMS can directly bind the promoter of  MGT5. An immunoelectron microscopy assay revealed that MGT5-His is localized to  the plasma membrane of the tapetum. These findings suggest that AMS directly  regulates MGT5 in the tapetum and thus induces export of Mg into the locule. The  mgt5 plant exhibits severe male sterility while the expression of MGT5 under the  tapetum-specific promoter A9 partly rescued mgt5 fertility. mgt5 fertility was  restored under high-Mg conditions. These findings suggest that the mgt5 tapetum  still has the ability to export Mg and that a sufficient supply of Mg from the  tapetum can improve the importation of Mg in the mgt5 male gametophyte.  Therefore, MGT5 plays an important role in Mg transport from the tapetum to the  microspore.', '2015 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13054', 'Yang']
