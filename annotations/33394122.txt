In flowering plants, pollen germination on the stigma and pollen tube growth in pistil tissues are critical for sexual plant reproduction, which are involved in the interactions between pollen/pollen tube and pistil tissues. GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are located on the external surface of the plasma membrane and function in various processes of sexual plant reproduction. The evidences suggest that GPI-APs participate in endosome machinery, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, the development of the transmitting tract, the maintenance of the integrity of pollen tube, the enhancement of interactions of the receptor-like kinase (RLK) and ligand, and guidance of the growth of pollen tube, and so on. In this review, we will summarize the recent progress on the roles of GPI-APs in the interactions between pollen/pollen tube and pistil tissues during pollination, such as pollen germination on the stigma, pollen tube growth in the transmitting tract, pollen tube guidance to the ovule, and pollen tube reception in the embryo sac. We will also discuss the future outlook of GPI-APs in the interactions between pollen/pollen tube and pistil tissues.
