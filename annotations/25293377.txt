['25293377', "Vacuolar sorting receptors (VSRs) in Arabidopsis mediate the sorting of soluble  proteins to vacuoles in the secretory pathway. The VSRs are post-translationally  modified by the attachment of N-glycans, but the functional significance of such  a modification remains unknown. Here we have studied the role(s) of glycosylation  in the stability, trafficking and vacuolar protein transport of AtVSR1 in  Arabidopsis protoplasts. AtVSR1 harbors three complex-type N-glycans, which are  located in the N-terminal 'PA domain', the central region and the C-terminal  epidermal growth factor repeat domain, respectively. We have demonstrated that:  (i) the N-glycans do not affect the targeting of AtVSR1 to pre-vacuolar  compartments (PVCs) and its vacuolar degradation; and (ii) N-glycosylation alters  the binding affinity of AtVSR1 to cargo proteins and affects the transport of  cargo into the vacuole. Hence, N-glycosylation of AtVSR1 plays a critical role in  its function as a VSR in plants.", '2014 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12696', 'Jiang']
