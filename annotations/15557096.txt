['15557096', "Plant cells produce different microtubule arrays that are essential for cell  division and morphogenesis without equivalent in other eukaryotes.  Microtubule-associated proteins influence the behavior of microtubules that is  presumed to culminate into transitions from one array to another. We analyzed the  microtubule-binding properties of three Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)  members, AtMAP65-1, AtMAP65-4, and AtMAP65-5, in live cells using laser scanning  confocal microscopy. Depending on the overall organization of the cortical array,  AtMAP65-1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) and AtMAP65-5-GFP associated with a  subset of microtubules. In cells containing both coaligned and oblique  microtubules, AtMAP65-1-GFP and AtMAP65-5-GFP tended to be associated with the  coaligned microtubules. Cortical microtubules labeled with AtMAP65-1-GFP and  AtMAP65-5-GFP appeared as thick bundles and showed more resistance to  microtubule-destabilizing drugs. The polymerization rates of AtMAP65-1-GFP and  AtMAP65-5-GFP microtubules were similar to those of tubulin-GFP marked  microtubules but were different from AtEB1a-GFP, a microtubule plus-end-binding  EB1-like protein that stimulated polymerization. By contrast, depolymerization  rates of AtMAP65-1-GFP- and AtMAP65-5-GFP-labeled microtubules were reduced.  AtMAP65-1-GFP associated with polymerizing microtubules within a bundle, and with  fixed microtubule termini, suggesting that AtMAP65-1's function is to bundle and  stabilize adjacent microtubules of the cortex. Polymerization within a bundle  took place in either direction so that bundling occurred between parallel or  antiparallel aligned microtubules. AtMAP65-4-GFP did not label cortical  microtubules or the preprophase band, despite continuous expression driven by the  35S promoter, and its subcellular localization was restricted to microtubules  that rearranged to form a spindle and the polar sides of the spindle proper. The  expression of AtMAP65-4 peaked at mitosis, in agreement with a function related  to spindle formation, whereas AtMAP65-1 and AtMAP65-5 were expressed throughout  the cell cycle.", '2004 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.051623', 'Geelen']
