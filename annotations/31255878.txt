The diverse biological activities of glucosinolate (GSL) hydrolysis products play significant biological and economical roles in the defense system and nutritional qualities of Brassica napus (oilseed rape). Yet, genomic-based study of the B. napus GSL regulatory mechanisms are scarce due to the complexity of working with polyploid species. To address these challenges, we used transcriptome-based GWAS approach, Associative Transcriptomics (AT), across a diversity panel of 288 B. napus genotypes to uncover the underlying genetic basis controlling quantitative variation of GSLs in B. napus vegetative tissues. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and gene expression markers (GEMs) associations identify orthologues of MYB28/HAG1 (AT5G61420), specifically the copies on chromosome A9 and C2, to be the key regulators of aliphatic GSL variation in leaves. We show that the positive correlation observed between aliphatic GSLs in seed and leaf is due to the amount synthesized, as controlled by Bna.HAG1.A9 and Bna.HAG1.C2, rather than by variation in the transport processes. In addition, AT and differential expression analysis in root tissues implicate an orthologue of MYB29/HAG3 (AT5G07690), Bna.HAG3.A3, as controlling root aromatic GSL variation. Based on the root expression data we also propose Bna.MAM3.A3 to have a role in controlling phenylalanine chain elongation for aromatic GSL biosynthesis. This work uncovers a regulator of homophenylalanine-derived aromatic GSLs and implicates the shared biosynthetic pathways between aliphatic and aromatic GSLs.
