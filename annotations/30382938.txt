['30382938', 'Mechanically activated (MA) ion channels convert physical forces into electrical  signals, and are essential for eukaryotic physiology. Despite their importance,  few bona-fide MA channels have been described in plants and animals. Here, we  show that various members of the OSCA and TMEM63 family of proteins from plants,  flies, and mammals confer mechanosensitivity to naive cells. We conclusively  demonstrate that OSCA1.2, one of the Arabidopsis thaliana OSCA proteins, is an  inherently mechanosensitive, pore-forming ion channel. Our results suggest that  OSCA/TMEM63 proteins are the largest family of MA ion channels identified, and  are conserved across eukaryotes. Our findings will enable studies to gain deep  insight into molecular mechanisms of MA channel gating, and will facilitate a  better understanding of mechanosensory processes in vivo across plants and  animals.', '2018 Nov 1', 'Elife', '10.7554/eLife.41844', 'ORCID:']
