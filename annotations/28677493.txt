Rice blast disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most destructive diseases of rice. Field isolates of M. oryzae rapidly adapt to their hosts and climate. Tracking the genetic and pathogenic variability of field isolates is essential to understand how M. oryzae interacts with hosts and environments. In this study, a total of 1,022 United States field isolates collected from 1959 to 2015 were analyzed for pathogenicity toward eight international rice differentials. A subset of 457 isolates was genotyped with 10 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The average polymorphism information content value of markers was 0.55, suggesting that the SSR markers were highly informative to capture the population variances. Six genetic clusters were identified by both STRUCTURE and discriminant analysis of principal components methods. Overall, Nei's diversity of M. oryzae in the United States was 0.53, which is higher than previously reported in a world rice blast collection (0.19). The observed subdivision was associated with collection time periods but not with geographic origin of the isolates. Races such as IC-17, IE-1, and IB-49 have been identified across almost all collection periods and all clusters; races such as IA-1, IB-17, and IH-1 have a much higher frequency in certain periods and clusters. Both genomic and pathogenicity changes of United States blast isolates were associated with collection year, suggesting that hosts are a driving force for the genomic variability of rice blast fungus.
