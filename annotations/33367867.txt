The development of plant model organisms has traditionally been analyzed using resource-heavy, tailored applications that are not easily transferable to distantly related non-model taxa. Thus, our understanding of plant development has been limited to a subset of traits, and evolutionary studies conducted most effectively either across very wide [e.g. Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice)] or narrow (i.e. population level) phylogenetic distances. As plant biologists seek to capitalize on natural diversity for crop improvement, enhance ecosystem functioning, and better understand plant responses to climate change, high-throughput and broadly applicable forms of existing molecular biology assays are becoming an invaluable resource. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly becoming a powerful tool in evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) studies, particularly through its application to understanding trait evolution at different levels of gene regulation. Here, I review some of the most common and emerging NGS-based methods, using exemplar studies in reproductive plant evo-devo to illustrate their potential.

Gene: !affects! Process 
Gene: !synthesizes! I 
NGS: !enables! Evo-Devo studies 
Evo-Devo: !improves! Crop improvement 
Evo-Devo: !enhances! Ecosystem functioning 
Evo-Devo: !understands! Plant responses to climate change
