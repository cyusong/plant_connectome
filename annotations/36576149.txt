Cell size control is one of the prerequisites for plant growth and development. Recently, a GRAS family transcription factor, SCARECROW-LIKE28 (SCL28), was identified as a critical regulator for both mitotic and postmitotic cell-size control. Here, we show that <i>SCL28</i> is specifically expressed in proliferating cells and exerts its function to delay G2 progression during mitotic cell cycle in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Overexpression of <i>SCL28</i> provokes a significant enlargement of cells in various organs and tissues, such as leaves, flowers and seeds, to different extents depending on the type of cells. The increased cell size is most likely due to a delayed G2 progression and accelerated onset of endoreplication, an atypical cell cycle repeating DNA replication without cytokinesis or mitosis. Unlike <i>DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING</i>, a rice ortholog of <i>SCL28</i>, SCL28 may not have a role in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling because sensitivity against brassinazole, a BR biosynthesis inhibitor, was not dramatically altered in <i>scl28</i> mutant and <i>SCL28</i>-overexpressing plants. Collectively, our findings strengthen a recently proposed model of cell size control by SCL28 and suggest the presence of diversified evolutionary mechanisms for the regulation and action of SCL28.
