The dodders (Cuscuta spp.) are a genus of shoot parasites. In nature, a dodder often simultaneously parasitizes two or more neighboring hosts. Salt stress is a common abiotic stress for plants. It is unclear whether dodder transmits physiologically relevant salt stress-induced systemic signals among its hosts and whether these systemic signals affect the hosts' tolerance to salt stress. Here, we simultaneously parasitized two or more cucumber plants with dodder. We found that salt treatment of one host highly primed the connected host, which showed strong decreases in the extent of leaf withering and cell death in response to subsequent salt stress. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that 24 h after salt treatment of one cucumber, the transcriptome of the other dodder-connected cucumber largely resembled that of the salt-treated one, indicating that inter-plant systemic signals primed these dodder-connected cucumbers at least partly through transcriptomic reconfiguration. Furthermore, salt treatment of one of the cucumbers induced physiological changes, including altered proline contents, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic rates, in both of the dodder-connected cucumbers. This study reveals a role of dodder in mediating salt-induced inter-plant signaling among dodder-connected hosts and highlights the physiological function of these mobile signals in plant-plant interactions under salt stress.
