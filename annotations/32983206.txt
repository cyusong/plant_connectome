Due to their slow movement and closure upon shade, partially closed stomata can be a substantial limitation to photosynthesis in variable light intensities. The abscisic acid deficient <i>flacca</i> mutant in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) displays very high stomatal conductance (<i>g<sub>s</sub></i> ). We aimed to determine to what extent this substantially increased <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> affects the rate of photosynthetic induction. Steady-state and dynamic photosynthesis characteristics were measured in <i>flacca</i> and wildtype leaves, by the use of simultaneous gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorometry. The steady-state response of photosynthesis to CO<sub>2</sub>, maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry (<i>F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub></i> ), as well as mesophyll conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion were not significantly different between genotypes, suggesting similar photosynthetic biochemistry, photoprotective capacity, and internal CO<sub>2</sub> permeability. When leaves adapted to shade (50 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) at 400 µbar CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure and high humidity (7 mbar leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit, VPD) were exposed to high irradiance (1500 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), photosynthetic induction was faster in <i>flacca</i> compared to wildtype leaves, and this was attributable to high initial <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in <i>flacca</i> (~0.6 mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>): in <i>flacca</i>, the times to reach 50 (<i>t<sub>50</sub></i> ) and 90% (<i>t<sub>90</sub></i> ) of full photosynthetic induction were 91 and 46% of wildtype values, respectively. Low humidity (15 mbar VPD) reduced <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> and slowed down photosynthetic induction in the wildtype, while no change was observed in <i>flacca</i>; under low humidity, <i>t<sub>50</sub></i> was 63% and <i>t<sub>90</sub></i> was 36% of wildtype levels in <i>flacca</i>. Photosynthetic induction in low CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure (200 µbar) increased <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in the wildtype (but not in <i>flacca</i>), and revealed no differences in the rate of photosynthetic induction between genotypes. Effects of higher <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in <i>flacca</i> were also visible in transients of photosystem II operating efficiency and non-photochemical quenching. Our results show that at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure, wildtype <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> is a substantial limitation to the rate of photosynthetic induction, which <i>flacca</i> overcomes by keeping its stomata open at all times, and it does so at the cost of reduced water use efficiency.
