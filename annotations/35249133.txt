ICEs are key transcription factors in response to cold in plant, they also balance plant growth and stress tolerance. Thus, we systematize the information about ICEs published to date. Low temperature is an important factor affecting plant growth and development. Exposing to cold condition results in a suit of effects on plants including reduction of plant growth and reproduction, and decrease in crop yield and quality. Plants have evolved a series of strategies to deal with cold stress such as reprogramming of the expression of genes and transcription factors. ICEs (Inducer of CBF Expression), as transcription factors regulating CBFs (C-repeat binding factor), play key roles in balancing plant growth and stress tolerance. Studies on ICEs focused on the function of ICEs on cold tolerance, growth and development; post-translational modifications of ICEs and crosstalk between the ICEs and phytohormones. In this review, we focus on systematizing the information published to date. We summarized the main advances of the functions of ICEs on the cold tolerance, growth and development. And we also elaborated the regulation of ICEs protein stability including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation of ICE. Finally, we described the function of ICEs in the crosstalk among different phytohormone signaling pathway and cold stress. This review provides perspectives for ongoing research about cold tolerance, growth and development in plant.
