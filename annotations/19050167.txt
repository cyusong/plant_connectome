['19050167', 'Pollen tubes must navigate through different female tissues to deliver sperm to  the embryo sac for fertilization. Protein disulfide isomerases play important  roles in the maturation of secreted or plasma membrane proteins. Here, we show  that certain T-DNA insertions in Arabidopsis thaliana PDIL2-1, a protein  disulfide isomerase (PDI), have reduced seed set, due to delays in embryo sac  maturation. Reciprocal crosses indicate that these mutations acted  sporophytically, and aniline blue staining and scanning electron microscopy  showed that funicular and micropylar pollen tube guidance were disrupted. A  PDIL2-1-yellow fluorescent protein fusion was mainly localized in the endoplasmic  reticulum and was expressed in all tissues examined. In ovules, expression in  integument tissues was much higher in the micropylar region in later  developmental stages, but there was no expression in embryo sacs. We show that  reduced seed set occurred when another copy of full-length PDIL2-1 or when  enzymatically active truncated versions were expressed, but not when an  enzymatically inactive version was expressed, indicating that these T-DNA  insertion lines are gain-of-function mutants. Our results suggest that these  truncated versions of PDIL2-1 function in sporophytic tissues to affect ovule  structure and impede embryo sac development, thereby disrupting pollen tube  guidance.', '2008 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.062919', 'McCormick']
