In order to analyze the putative impact of polyamines (PAs) on the plant response to salt, seedlings from the salt-sensitive rice cultivar I Kong Pao (IKP) were exposed for 5, 12 and 19 days to 0, 50 or 100 mM NaCl in the absence, or in the presence of exogenous PAs (putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) or spermine (Spm) 1mM) or inhibitors of PA synthesis (methylglyoxalbis-guanyl hydrazone (MGBG) 1mM, cyclohexylammonium (CHA) 5mM and D-arginine (D-Arg) 5mM). The addition of PAs in nutritive solution reduced plant growth in the absence of NaCl and did not afford protection in the presence of salt. PA-treated plants exhibited a higher K+/Na+ ratio in the shoots, suggesting an improved discrimination among monovalent cations at the root level, especially at the sites of xylem loading. The diamine Put induced a decrease in the shoot water content in the presence of NaCl, while Spd and Spm had no effects on the plant water status. In contrast to Spd, Spm was efficiently translocated to the shoots. Both PAs (Spd and Spm) induced a decrease in cell membrane stability as suggested by a strong increase in malondialdehyde content of PA-treated plants exposed to NaCl. These results are discussed in relation to the putative functions of PAs in stressed plant metabolism.
