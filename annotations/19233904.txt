['19233904', 'Membrane trafficking plays a fundamental role in eukaryotic cell biology. Of the  numerous known or predicted protein components of the plant cell trafficking  system, only a relatively small subset have been characterized with respect to  their biological roles in plant growth, development, and response to stresses. In  this study, we investigated the subcellular localization and function of an  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) small GTPase belonging to the RabE family.  RabE proteins are phylogenetically related to well-characterized regulators of  polarized vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane in  animal and yeast cells. The RabE family of GTPases has also been proposed to be a  putative host target of AvrPto, an effector protein produced by the plant  pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, based on yeast two-hybrid analysis. We generated  transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively expressed one of the five RabE  proteins (RabE1d) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP-RabE1d and  endogenous RabE proteins were found to be associated with the Golgi apparatus and  the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis leaf cells. RabE down-regulation, due to  cosuppression in transgenic plants, resulted in drastically altered leaf  morphology and reduced plant size, providing experimental evidence for an  important role of RabE GTPases in regulating plant growth. RabE down-regulation  did not affect plant susceptibility to pathogenic P. syringae bacteria;  conversely, expression of the constitutively active RabE1d-Q74L enhanced plant  defenses, conferring resistance to P. syringae infection.', '2009 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.132092', 'He']
