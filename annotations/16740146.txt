['16740146', 'Gene duplication events, and the subsequent functional divergence of duplicates,  are believed to be important evolutionary agents, driving morphological  diversification. We have studied the structural and functional diversification of  members of a plant-specific gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana by analysing  mutant phenotypes, expression patterns and phylogeny. The SHI gene family  comprises ten members that encode proteins with a RING finger-like zinc finger  motif. We show that, despite being highly divergent in sequence, except in two  conserved regions, many of the SHI-related genes are partially redundant in  function and synergistically promote gynoecium, stamen and leaf development in  Arabidopsis. Gynoecia of the loss-of-function sty1-1 mutant display subtle  morphological defects, and, although mutations in the related STY2, SHI, SRS3,  SRS4, SRS5, SRS7 and LRP1 genes have no apparent effect on gynoecium development,  the sty1-1 mutant phenotype is gradually enhanced in double, triple, quadruple  and quintuple mutant combinations, suggesting a remarkably extensive functional  conservation within the family, which appears to be based on dosage dependency  and protection against dominant negative mutations. In multiple mutant lines, all  marginal tissues in the apical part of the gynoecium are dramatically reduced or  missing, and our data indicate that SHI family members may promote formation of  these tissues downstream of the transcriptional co-repressor LEUNIG (LUG).', '2006 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02774.x', 'Sundberg']
