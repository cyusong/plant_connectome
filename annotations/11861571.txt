['11861571', 'We have mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for natural variation in  light and hormone response between the Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) and Landsberg  erecta (Ler) accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana using recombinant inbred lines  (RILs). Hypocotyl length was measured in four light environments: white, blue,  red, and far-red light and in the dark. In addition, white light plus gibberellin  (GA) and dark plus the brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor brassinazole (BRZ)  were used to detect hormone effects. Twelve QTL were identified that map to loci  not previously known to affect light response, as well as loci where candidate  genes have been identified from known mutations. Some QTL act in all environments  while others show genotype-by-environment interaction. A global threshold was  established to identify a significant epistatic interaction between two loci that  have few main effects of their own. LIGHT1, a major QTL, has been confirmed in a  near isogenic line (NIL) and maps to a new locus with effects in all light  environments. The erecta mutation can explain the effect of the HYP2 QTL in the  blue, BRZ, and dark environments, but not in far-red. LIGHT2, also confirmed in  an NIL, has effects in white and red light and shows interaction with GA. The  phenotype and map position of LIGHT2 suggest the photoreceptor PHYB as a  candidate gene. Natural variation in light and hormone response thus defines both  new genes and known genes that control light response in wild accessions.', '2002 Feb', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/160.2.683', 'Chory']
