The transport of the plant hormone auxin has been under intense investigation since its identification 80 years ago. Studies have gradually refined our understanding of the importance of auxin transport in many aspects of plant signalling and development, and the focus has intensified in recent years towards the identification of the proteins involved in auxin transport and their functional mechanism. Within the past 18 months, the field has progressed rapidly, with confirmation that several distinct classes of proteins, previously dubbed as 'putative auxin permeases' or 'auxin transport facilitators', are bona fide transporters of IAA (indol-3-ylacetic acid). In this review we will appraise the recent transport data and highlight likely future research directions, including the characterization of auxiliary proteins necessary for the regulation of auxin transporters.
