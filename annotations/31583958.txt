The allocation of nutrient resources to growth and metabolism is an essential function for controlling biomass accumulation in photoautotrophic organisms. One essential protein complex involved in this process is the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase. It has been shown that the inhibition of TOR leads to a considerable upsurge in the amino acid levels. This molecular phenotype relies mainly on the availability of light, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). To validate the time-resolved response of C and N metabolites, we used a targeted gas chromatography mass spectrometery (GC-MS)-based metabolomic approach, where we examined the response of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> upon TOR inhibition under C-limited condition, namely extended darkness. Contrary to C-supplemented conditions, the rapid increase in the amino acid levels is suppressed almost completely 4 h after TOR inhibition, confirming that C supply is essential to raise the amino acid levels mediated by their <i>de novo</i> synthesis. An exception to this observation was the levels of aspartate, which is presumably synthesized via the anaplerotic pathway. In agreement with previous reports, TOR repression, under these C-limited conditions, leads to a significant reduction in the C/N ratio, corroborating with the crucial role of the pathway in maintaining the metabolic balance of the cells and consequently propelling growth.
