['17637677', 'Jasmonate and related signalling compounds have a crucial role in both host  immunity and development in plants, but the molecular details of the signalling  mechanism are poorly understood. Here we identify members of the jasmonate  ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein family as key regulators of jasmonate signalling. JAZ1  protein acts to repress transcription of jasmonate-responsive genes. Jasmonate  treatment causes JAZ1 degradation and this degradation is dependent on activities  of the SCF(COI1) ubiquitin ligase and the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, the  jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) conjugate, but not other jasmonate-derivatives such  as jasmonate, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, or methyl-jasmonate, promotes physical  interaction between COI1 and JAZ1 proteins in the absence of other plant  proteins. Our results suggest a model in which jasmonate ligands promote the  binding of the SCF(COI1) ubiquitin ligase to and subsequent degradation of the  JAZ1 repressor protein, and implicate the SCF(COI1)-JAZ1 protein complex as a  site of perception of the plant hormone JA-Ile.', '2007 Aug 9', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature05960', 'Browse']
