Nitrogen (N) fertilizer maximizes the growth of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) by improving photosynthetic performance. Elucidating the dynamic relationship between fluorescence and plant N status could provide a non-destructive diagnosis of N status and the breeding of N-efficient cultivars. The aim of this study was to explore the impacts of different N treatments on photosynthesis at a spatial-temporal scale and to evaluate the performance of three fluorescence techniques for the diagnosis of N status. One-way ANOVA and linear discriminant analysis were applied to analyze fluorescence data acquired by a continuous excitation chlorophyll fluorimeter (OJIP transient analysis), pulse amplitude-modulated chlorophyll fluorescence (PAM-ChlF), and multicolor fluorescence (MCF) imaging. The results showed that the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm) and performance index for photosynthesis (PIABS) of bottom leaves were sensitive to N status at the bolting stage, whereas the red fluorescence/far-red fluorescence ratio of top leaves was sensitive at the early seedling stage. Although the classification of N treatments by the three techniques achieved comparable accuracies, MCF imaging showed the best potential for early diagnosis of N status in field phenotyping because it had the highest sensitivity in the top leaves, at the early seedling stage. The findings of this study could facilitate research on N management and the breeding of N-efficient cultivars.
