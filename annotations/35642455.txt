Plants age by developmental phase changes. In Arabidopsis, the juvenile to adult vegetative phase change (VPC) is marked by clear heteroblastic changes in leaves. VPC and the subsequent vegetative to reproductive phase change are promoted by SQUAMOSA PROMOTOR BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors and repressed by miR156/157 targeting SPL transcripts. By genetic, phenotypic, and gene expression analyses, we studied the role of the longevity-promoting AT-HOOK MOTIF NUCLEAR LOCALIZED 15 (AHL15) and family members in SPL-driven plant ageing. Arabidopsis ahl loss-of-function mutants showed accelerated VPC and flowering, whereas AHL15 overexpression delayed these phase changes. Expression analysis and tissue-specific AHL15 overexpression revealed that AHL15 affects VPC and flowering time directly through its expression in the shoot apical meristem and young leaves, and that AHL15 represses SPL2/9/13/15 gene expression in a miR156/157-independent manner. The juvenile traits of spl loss-of-function mutants appeared to depend on enhanced expression of the AHL15 gene, whereas SPL activity prevented vegetative growth from axillary meristem by repressing AHL15 expression. Our results place AHL15 and close family members together with SPLs in a reciprocal regulatory feedback loop that modulates VPC, flowering time, and axillary meristem development in response to both internal and external signals.
