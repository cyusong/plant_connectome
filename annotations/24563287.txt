['24563287', 'Plant growth and development require proper cell wall organization but little is  known about the transcription factors responsible for the regulation of gene  expression involved in cell wall organization. Here we show, using Arabidopsis  thaliana, that constitutive expression of the chimeric repressor for the MYB87  transcription factor causes suppression of longitudinal elongation, aberrant  radial growth, and radially expanded or swollen cells in multiple organs.  Microarray analysis revealed that plants expressing the chimeric repressor have  altered expression of various cell wall related genes. MYB87 may therefore  function as a regulator of genes affecting cell wall organization and remodeling.  These findings improve our understanding of cell wall regulation and its roles in  plant growth and development and also contribute information that may allow  engineering of plant growth and architecture.', '2014 May', 'Biotechnol Lett', '10.1007/s10529-013-1451-8', 'Ohme-Takagi']
