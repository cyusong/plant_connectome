['17259259', 'Stomata are specialized epidermal structures that regulate gas (CO(2) and O(2))  and water vapor exchange between plants and their environment. In Arabidopsis  thaliana, stomatal development is preceded by asymmetric cell divisions, and  stomatal distribution follows the one-cell spacing rule, reflecting the  coordination of cell fate specification. Stomatal development and patterning are  regulated by both genetic and environmental signals. Here, we report that  Arabidopsis MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE3 (MPK3) and MPK6, two  environmentally responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and their  upstream MAPK kinases, MKK4 and MKK5, are key regulators of stomatal development  and patterning. Loss of function of MKK4/MKK5 or MPK3/MPK6 disrupts the  coordinated cell fate specification of stomata versus pavement cells, resulting  in the formation of clustered stomata. Conversely, activation of  MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 causes the suppression of asymmetric cell divisions and  stomatal cell fate specification, resulting in a lack of stomatal  differentiation. We further establish that the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 module is  downstream of YODA, a MAPKKK. The establishment of a complete MAPK signaling  cascade as a key regulator of stomatal development and patterning advances our  understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of intercellular signaling events that  coordinate cell fate specification during stomatal development.', '2007 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.048298', 'Zhang']
