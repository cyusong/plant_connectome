The roothairless1 (rth1) mutant is impaired in root hair elongation and exhibits other growth abnormalities. Unicellular root hairs elongate via localized tip growth, a process mediated by polar exocytosis of secretory vesicles. We report here the cloning of the rth1 gene that encodes a sec3 homolog. In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammals, sec3 is a subunit of the exocyst complex, which tethers exocytotic vesicles prior to their fusion. The cloning of the rth1 gene associates the homologs of exocyst subunits to an exocytotic process in plant development and supports the hypothesis that exocyst-like proteins are involved in plant exocytosis. Proteomic analyses identified four proteins that accumulate to different levels in wild-type and rth1 primary roots. The preferential accumulation in the rth1 mutant proteome of a negative regulator of the cell cycle (a prohibitin) may at least partially explain the delayed development and flowering of the rth1 mutant.
