Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) play a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing in all eukaryotic cells. In contrast to the relatively broad knowledge on snRNP assembly within the nucleus, the spatial organization of the cytoplasmic stages of their maturation remains poorly understood. Nevertheless, sparse research indicates that, similar to the nuclear steps, the crucial processes of cytoplasmic snRNP assembly may also be strictly spatially regulated. In European larch microsporocytes, it was determined that the cytoplasmic assembly of snRNPs within a cell might occur in two distinct spatial manners, which depend on the rate of de novo snRNP formation in relation to the steady state of these particles within the nucleus. During periods of moderate expression of splicing elements, the cytoplasmic assembly of snRNPs occurred diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. Increased expression of both Sm proteins and U snRNA triggered the accumulation of these particles within distinct, non-membranous RNP-rich granules, which are referred to as snRNP-rich cytoplasmic bodies.
