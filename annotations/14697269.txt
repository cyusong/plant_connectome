['14697269', 'A bio-fermentation technique was used for the in vivo diversification of  flavonoid structures based on expression in Escherichia coli of six  O-methyltransferases (OMTs) from Mentha x piperita and one O-glucosyltransferase  (GT) each from Arabidopsis thaliana and Allium cepa. Enzymes were shown to be  regio-specific in in vitro experiments and modified a broad range of flavonoid  substrates at various positions. Using the flavonol quercetin as a model  substrate, we show that the product spectrum produced with the in vivo approach  is identical to that found in vitro. Additionally, using mixed cultures of E.  coli expressing different classes of modifying genes (OMTs and GTs), the  production of polymethylated flavonoid glucosides was observed. This report  demonstrates the potential to increase the structural diversity of plant  secondary metabolites using a multi-enzyme, bio-fermentation approach.', '2004 Jan', 'Phytochemistry', '10.1016/j.phytochem.2003.10.005', 'Graser']
