Laser microdissection (LM) allows for the isolation of specific cells of interest from heterogeneous tissues under direct microscopic visualization with the assistance of a laser beam. By permitting global analyses of gene expression and metabolites in the selected cells, it is a powerful tool for understanding the biological processes in individual cell types during development or in response to various stimuli. Recently, LM technology has been successfully applied to the separation of individual plant cell types. Here, we provide an overview of applications of LM combined with high-throughput technologies including transcript analyses [microarrays, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and 454-sequencing], proteomic analyses and metabolomic profiling, for cell type-specific gene expression analyses in plants.
