Intracellular transport is facilitated by aquaporins and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> is removed by catalase, peroxiredoxin, glutathione peroxidase-like enzymes and ascorbate peroxidase, all of which have cell compartment-specific isoforms. Apoplastic H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> influences cell expansion, development and defence by its involvement in type III peroxidase-mediated polymer cross-linking, lignification and, possibly, cell expansion via H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> -derived hydroxyl radicals. Excess H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> triggers chloroplast and peroxisome autophagy and programmed cell death. The role of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> in signalling, for example during acclimation to stress and pathogen defence, has received much attention, but the signal transduction mechanisms are poorly defined. H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> oxidizes specific cysteine residues of target proteins to the sulfenic acid form and, similar to other organisms, this modification could initiate thiol-based redox relays and modify target enzymes, receptor kinases and transcription factors. Quantification of the sources and sinks of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> is being improved by the spatial and temporal resolution of genetically encoded H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> sensors, such as HyPer and roGFP2-Orp1. These H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> sensors, combined with the detection of specific proteins modified by H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> , will allow a deeper understanding of its signalling roles.
