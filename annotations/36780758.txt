The entry of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the biosphere is mediated by the enzyme Rubisco, which catalyzes the carboxylation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) as the entry reaction of the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle (CBBC), leading to the formation of 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PGA) per CO<sub>2</sub> fixed. 3PGA is reduced to triose phosphates at the expense of NADPH + H<sup>+</sup> and ATP that are provided by the photosynthetic light reactions. Triose phosphates are the principal products of the CBBC and the precursors for almost any compound in the biosphere.
