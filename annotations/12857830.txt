['12857830', 'Phototropism and hypocotyl growth inhibition are modulated by the coaction of  different blue-light photoreceptors and their signaling pathways. How seedlings  integrate the activities of the different blue-light photoreceptors to coordinate  these hypocotyl growth responses is still unclear. We have used time-lapse  imaging and a nontraditional mathematical approach to conduct a detailed  examination of phototropism in wild-type Arabidopsis and various blue-light  photoreceptor mutants. Our results indicate that high fluence rates of blue light  (100 micro mol m(-)(2) s(-)(1)) attenuate phototropism through the coaction of  the phototropin and cryptochrome blue-light photoreceptors. In contrast, we also  demonstrate that phototropins and cryptochromes function together to enhance  phototropism under low fluence rates (<1.0 micro mol m(-)(2) s(-)(1)) of blue  light. Based on our results, we hypothesize that phototropins and cryptochromes  regulate phototropism by coordinating the balance between stimulation and  inhibition of growth of the hypocotyl depending on the fluence rate of blue  light.', '2003 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.102.018481', 'Hangarter']
