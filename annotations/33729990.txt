['33729990', 'Cellulose is synthesized by cellulose synthases (CESAs) from the  glycosyltransferase GT-2 family. In plants, the CESAs form a six-lobed  rosette-shaped CESA complex (CSC). Here we report crystal structures of the  catalytic domain of Arabidopsis thaliana CESA3 (AtCESA3(CatD)) in both apo and  uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose (UDP-Glc)-bound forms. AtCESA3(CatD) has an  overall GT-A fold core domain sandwiched between a plant-conserved region (P-CR)  and a class-specific region (C-SR). By superimposing the structure of  AtCESA3(CatD) onto the bacterial cellulose synthase BcsA, we found that the  coordination of the UDP-Glc differs, indicating different substrate coordination  during cellulose synthesis in plants and bacteria. Moreover, structural analyses  revealed that AtCESA3(CatD) can form a homodimer mainly via interactions between  specific beta strands. We confirmed the importance of specific amino acids on  these strands for homodimerization through yeast and in planta assays using  point-mutated full-length AtCESA3. Our work provides molecular insights into how  the substrate UDP-Glc is coordinated in the CESAs and how the CESAs might  dimerize to eventually assemble into CSCs in plants.', '2021 Mar 16', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.2024015118', 'Gao']
