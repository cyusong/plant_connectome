['23690534', 'Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins serve as  intracellular sensors to detect pathogen effectors and trigger immune responses.  Transcription of the NB-LRR-encoding Resistance (R) genes needs to be tightly  controlled to avoid inappropriate defense activation. How the expression of the  NB-LRR R genes is regulated is poorly understood. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive 1 (snc1) mutant carries a  gain-of-function mutation in a Toll/Interleukin1 receptor-like  (TIR)-NB-LRR-encoding gene, resulting in the constitutive activation of plant  defense responses. A snc1 suppressor screen identified modifier of snc1,9 (mos9),  which partially suppresses the autoimmune phenotypes of snc1. Positional cloning  revealed that MOS9 encodes a plant-specific protein of unknown function.  Expression analysis showed that MOS9 is required for the full expression of  TIR-NB-LRR protein-encoding RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA 4 (RPP4) and  SNC1, both of which reside in the RPP4 cluster. Coimmunoprecipitation and mass  spectrometry analyses revealed that MOS9 associates with the Set1 class lysine 4  of histone 3 (H3K4) methyltransferase Arabidopsis Trithorax-Related7 (ATXR7).  Like MOS9, ATXR7 is also required for the full expression of SNC1 and the  autoimmune phenotypes in the snc1 mutant. In atxr7 mutant plants, the expression  of RPP4 is similarly reduced, and resistance against Hyaloperonospora  arabidopsidis Emwa1 is compromised. Consistent with the attenuated expression of  SNC1 and RPP4, trimethylated H3K4 marks are reduced around the promoters of SNC1  and RPP4 in mos9 plants. Our data suggest that MOS9 functions together with ATXR7  to regulate the expression of SNC1 and RPP4 through H3K4 methylation, which plays  an important role in fine-tuning their transcription levels and functions in  plant defense.', '2013 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.214551', 'Li']
