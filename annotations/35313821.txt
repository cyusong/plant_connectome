Allopolyploid breeding is an efficient technique for improving the low seed setting rate of autotetraploids in plant breeding and one of the most promising breeding methods. However, there have been few comprehensive studies of the posttranscriptional mechanism in allopolyploids. By crossing cultivated rice (Oryza sativa, genome AA) with wild rice (Oryza punctata, genome BB), we created hybrid rice lines with different ploidy and genome compositions [diploid hybrid F01 (AB), allotetraploid hybrid F02 (AABB) and F03 (AAAB)]. The genetic differences of the hybrids and the mechanism of allopolyploid breeding dominance were revealed through morphological and cytological observations and single molecule real-time sequencing techniques. The tissues and organs of allotetraploid hybrid F02 exhibited "gigantism" and the highest levels of fertility. The numbers of non-redundant transcripts, gene loci and new isoforms in the polyploid rice lines were higher and the isoform lengths greater than those of the diploid line. Moreover, alternative splicing (AS) events occurred twice as often in the polyploid rice lines than the diploid line. During these events, intron retention dominated. Furthermore, a large number of new genes and isoforms specific to the lines of different ploidy were discovered. The results indicated that alternative polyadenylation (APA) and AS events contributed to the complexity and superiority of polyploids in the activity of translation regulators, nucleic acid binding transcription factor activities and the regulation of molecular function. Therefore, these APA and AS events in allopolyploid rice were found to play a role in regulation. Our study provides new germplasm for polyploid rice breeding and reveals complex regulatory mechanisms that may be related to heterosis and fertility.
