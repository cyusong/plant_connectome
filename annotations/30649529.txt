Plant hormone biology is an ever-evolving field and as such, novel avenues of research must always be sought. Technological and theoretical advancement can also allow for previously dismissed research to yield equally interesting insights into processes now that they are better understood. The auxin phenylacetic acid (PAA) is an excellent example of this. PAA is a plant auxin that also possesses substantial antimicrobial activity. It has a broad distribution and has been studied in bacteria, fungi, algae and land plants. Research on this compound in plants was prominent in the 1980s, where its bioactivity and broad distribution were frequently examined. Unfortunately, due to the strong interest in the quintessential auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), research on PAA quickly petered out. Recently, several groups have resumed investigations on this hormone in plants, yet, little is known about PAA biology and its physiological role is unclear. PAA biosynthesis from the amino acid Phe invites direct comparisons with previously studied IAA biosynthesis pathways, and recent work has shown that PAA metabolism and signaling appears to be similar to that of IAA. However, given the large gap between previous work and recent investigations, a historical review of this auxin is required to renew our understanding of PAA. Here, previous work on PAA is reassessed in light of recent research in plants and serves as a synthesis of current knowledge on PAA biology.
