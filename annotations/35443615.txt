CHY zinc-finger and RING finger (CHYR) proteins have been functionally characterized in plant growth, development and various stress responses. However, the genome-wide analysis was not performed in wheat. In this study, a total of 18 TaCHYR genes were identified in wheat and classified into three groups. All TaCHYR genes contained CHY-zinc finger, C3H2C3-type RING finger and zinc ribbon domains, and group III members included 1-3 hemerythrin domains in the N-terminus regions. TaCHYR genes in each group shared similar conserved domains distribution. Chromosomal location, synteny and cis-elements analysis of TaCHYRs were also analyzed. Real-time PCR results indicated that most of selected 9 TaCHYR genes exhibited higher expression levels in leaves during wheat seedling stage. All these TaCHYR genes were up-regulated after PEG treatment, and these TaCHYRs exhibited differential expression patterns in response to salt, cold and heat stress in seedling leaves. The growth of yeast cells expressing TaCHYR2.1, TaCHYR9.2 and TaCHYR11.1 were inhibited under salt and dehydration stress. Moreover, gene ontology (GO) annotation, protein interaction and miRNA regulatory network of TaCHYR genes were analyzed. These results increase our understanding of CHYR genes and provide robust candidate genes for further functional investigations aimed at crop improvement.
