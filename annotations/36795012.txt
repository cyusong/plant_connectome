Plants must make decisions to balance their growth versus defense against pathogens. Signaling of the plant peptide hormone phytosulfokine (PSK) has emerged as a critical stimulus for growth promotion. In this issue of The EMBO Journal, Ding et al (2022) show that PSK signaling promotes nitrogen assimilation via phosphorylation of glutamate synthase 2 (GS2). In the absence of PSK signaling, the plants growth is stunted, but its resistance to disease is reinforced.
