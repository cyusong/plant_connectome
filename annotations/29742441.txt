['29742441', 'Organogenesis in higher plants occurs in the shoot meristem, which contains  pluripotent stem cells. Here, we show that two multiple C2 domain and  transmembrane region proteins, FT INTERACTING PROTEIN 3 (FTIP3) and FTIP4, play  an essential role in mediating proliferation and differentiation of shoot stem  cells in Arabidopsis. FTIP3/4 prevent intracellular trafficking of a key  regulator, SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM), to the plasma membrane in cells in the  peripheral shoot meristem region. This facilitates STM recycling to the nucleus  to maintain stem cells. Without FTIP3/4, STM localizes substantially to the  plasma membrane, which promotes intercellular trafficking but compromises nuclear  localization of STM. This accelerates stem cell differentiation, causing early  termination of shoot apices and resulting in dwarf and bushy phenotypes. Our  findings reveal a molecular framework that determines the fate of shoot stem  cells and the resulting aboveground plant body.', '2018 May 8', 'Cell Rep', '10.1016/j.celrep.2018.04.033', 'Yu']
