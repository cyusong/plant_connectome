['20231465', 'Endocytosis performs a wide range of functions in animals and plants.  Clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation is an initial step of endocytosis, and in  animal cells is largely achieved by dynamins. However, little is known of its  molecular mechanisms in plant cells. To identify dynamin-related proteins (DRPs)  involved in endocytic CCV formation in plant cells, we compared the behaviors of  two structurally different Arabidopsis DRPs, DRP2B and DRP1A, with those of the  clathrin light chain (CLC), a marker of CCVs, at the plasma membrane by variable  incidence angle fluorescent microscopy (VIAFM). DRP2B shares domain organization  with animal dynamins whereas DRP1A is plant-specific. We show that green  fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged DRP2B and DRP1A colocalized with CLC tagged with  monomeric Kusabira Orange (mKO) in Arabidopsis cultured cells. Time-lapse VIAFM  observations suggested that both GFP-DRP2B and GFP-DRP1A appeared and accumulated  on the existing mKO-CLC foci and disappeared at the same time as or immediately  after the disappearance of mKO-CLC. Moreover, DRP2B and DRP1A colocalized and  assembled/disassembled together at the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis cells. A  yeast two-hybrid assay showed that DRP2B and DRP1A interacted with each other. An  inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, tyrphostin A23, disturbed the  localization of DRP1A, but had little effect on the localization of DRP2B,  indicating that DRP1A and DRP2B have different molecular properties. These  results suggest that DRP2B and DRP1A participate together in endocytic CCV  formation in Arabidopsis cells despite the difference of their molecular  properties.', '2010 Mar 30', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0913562107', 'Tsutsumi']
