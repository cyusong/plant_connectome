['29056553', 'Low temperatures affect plant growth, development, productivity, and ecological  distribution. Expression of the C-repeat-binding factor (CBF) transcription  factors is induced by cold stress, which in turn activates downstream  cold-responsive (COR) genes that are required for the acquisition of freezing  tolerance. Inducer of CBF expression 1 (ICE1) is a master regulator of CBFs, and  ICE1 stability is crucial for its function. However, the regulation of ICE1 is  not well understood. Here, we report that mitogen-activated protein kinase 3  (MPK3) and MPK6 interact with and phosphorylate ICE1, which reduces its stability  and transcriptional activity. Consistently, the mpk3 and mpk6 single mutants and  the mpk3 mpk6 double mutants show enhanced freezing tolerance, whereas MPK3/MPK6  activation attenuates freezing tolerance. Phosphor-inactive mutations of ICE1  complement freezing sensitivity in the ice1-2 mutant. These combined results  indicate that MPK3/MPK6 phosphorylate and destabilize ICE1, which negatively  regulates CBF expression and freezing tolerance in plants.', '2017 Dec 4', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/j.devcel.2017.09.025', 'Yang']
