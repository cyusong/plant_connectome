The targeted (or directed) tagging is a strategy aimed to mobilize a tranposon into a specific gene (target). Only a very few Arabidopsis genes have been tagged by this way, thus the efficiency of the strategy, as well as the diversity of the alleles obtained are not well documented. We have used a maize Ds element in a directed tagging of HY2. The starting Ds element, located 22 kb proximal to HY2, has been remobilized in a cross with an Ac transposase source line. From the F2 progeny of 4800 F1 we phenotypically isolated seven hy2 mutants. Molecular analysis of these alleles revealed that two contained a Ds element in HY2 and were instable, three have a large deletion that partially or completely removed HY2, one has a footprint in a HY2 exon and one leaky allele consisted of a 22 kb inversion upstream the HY2 coding sequence. Thus, the transposon-based directed tagging strategy generates a wide diversity of tagged and non-tagged alleles that can be used to generate allelic series or deletion of clustered genes.
