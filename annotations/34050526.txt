The D1:Val219 residue of Photosystem II in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was mutated to alanine or isoleucine, creating the V219A and V219I mutants, respectively. Oxygen evolution was slowed in these mutants, while chlorophyll a fluorescence induction assays indicated slowed electron transfer. As previously observed [Erickson J.M., Rahire, M., Rochaix, J.-D. and Mets. L. (1985) Science, 228, 204-207], the V219I mutant was resistant to 3,4-dichloro-1,1-dimethyl urea (DCMU); however, the V219A strain displayed no DCMU resistance. Additionally, the V219A strain was less sensitive to the addition of formate than the control, while the V219I strain was more sensitive to formate. Both mutant strains were susceptible to photodamage and required protein synthesis for recovery. We hypothesize that the sensitivity to DCMU and the extent of bicarbonate-reversible formate-induced inhibition, as well as the capacity for recovery in cells following photodamage, are influenced by the hydrophobicity of the environment associated with the Val219 residue in D1.
