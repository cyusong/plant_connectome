Many plant species produce multiple leaf flushes during the growing season, which might have major consequences for within-plant variation in chemistry and species interactions. Yet, we lack a theoretical or empirical framework for how differences among leaf flushes might shape variation in damage by insects and diseases. We assessed the impact of leaf flush identity on leaf chemistry, insect attack and pathogen infection on the pedunculate oak Quercus robur by sampling leaves from each leaf flush in 20 populations across seven European countries during an entire growing season. The first leaf flush had higher levels of primary compounds, and lower levels of secondary compounds, than the second flush, whereas plant chemistry was highly variable in the third flush. Insect attack decreased from the first to the third flush, whereas infection by oak powdery mildew was lowest on leaves from the first flush. The relationship between plant chemistry, insect attack and pathogen infection varied strongly among leaf flushes and seasons. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering differences among leaf flushes for our understanding of within-tree variation in chemistry, insect attack and disease levels, something particularly relevant given the expected increase in the number of leaf flushes with climate change.

leaf flush: !affects! plant chemistry
insect attack: !decreases! from first to third leaf flush
pathogen infection: !lowest on! leaves from first flush
plant chemistry: !varies! among leaf flushes and seasons
climate change: !increases! number of leaf flushes
