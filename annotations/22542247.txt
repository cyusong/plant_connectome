To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of plant immune responses, we isolated genes whose expression was regulated by inoculation with Ralstonia solanacearum. Here, we report the characterization of Nicotiana benthamiana belonging to the SEC14-gene superfamily designated as Nicotiana benthamiana SEC14 (NbSEC14). NbSEC14 rescued growth defects and impaired invertase secretion associated with the yeast sec14p temperature-sensitive mutant, while recombinant NbSec14 protein had phospholipids transfer activity. NbSEC14 expression was up-regulated in N. benthamiana leaves after inoculation with virulent or avirulent R. solanacearum. Expression of NbSEC14 was induced by treatment with chitin, flg22, and by Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of INF1 elicitin, AvrA from R. solanacearum, and co-expression of the capsid protein from Tobacco mild green mosaic virus with its cognate resistance L1 protein. NbSEC14-silenced plants showed accelerated growth of both the virulent and avirulent R. solanacearum as well as acceleration of disease development. This study may provide useful information for the further analysis of the function of plant Sec14 protein homologs in the regulation of plant immune responses.
