['20738726', 'RNA helicases are adenosine tri-phosphatases that unwind the secondary structures  of RNAs and are required in almost any aspect of RNA metabolism. They are highly  conserved from prokaryotic to eukaryotic organisms. However, their precise roles  in plant physiology and development remain to be clarified. Here we report that  the mutation in the gene SLOW WALKER3 (SWA3) results in the slow and retarded  progression of mitosis during megagametogenesis in Arabidopsis. SWA3 is a  putative RNA helicase of the DEAD-box subfamily. Mutant megagametophyte  development is arrested at four- or eight-nucleate stages, furthermore, one of  the synergids in about half of the mutant embryo sacs displays abnormal polarity,  with its nucleus locating at the chalazal end, instead of the micropylar end in  the wild-type. Transmission of the mutation through female gametophytes is  severely reduced in swa3. However, a small portion of mutant embryo sacs are able  to develop into mature and functional female gametophytes when pollination was  postponed. The SWA3 in Arabidopsis is a homolog of Dbp8 in yeast. Dbp8 interacts  with Efs2 and is essential for biogenesis of 18S rRNA in yeast. Our data suggest  that SWA3 may form a complex with AtEfs2 and take roles in ribosomal biogenesis  as RNA helicase during megagametogenesis in Arabidopsis.', '2010 Sep', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/j.1744-7909.2010.00972.x', 'Yang']
