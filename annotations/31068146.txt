The functional characteristics of SLAC/SLAH family members isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana, poplar, barley and rice have been comprehensively investigated. However, there are no reports regarding SLAC/SLAH family genes from Rosaceae plants. In this study, the function of PbrSLAH3, which is predominately expressed in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) root, was investigated. PbrSLAH3 can rescue the ammonium toxicity phenomenon of slah3 mutant plants under high-ammonium/low-nitrate conditions. In addition, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed that PbrSLAH3 interacts with PbrCPK32. Moreover, when PbrSLAH3 was co-expressed with either the Arabidopsis calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK) 21 or PbrCPK32 in Xenopus oocytes, yellow fluorescence was emitted from the oocytes and typical anion currents were recorded in the presence of extracellular NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. However, when PbrSLAH3 alone was injected, no yellow fluorescence or anion currents were recorded, suggesting that anion channel PbrSLAH3 activity was controlled through phosphorylation. Finally, electrophysiological and transgene results showed that PbrSLAH3 was more permeable to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> than Cl<sup>-</sup>. We suggest that PbrSLAH3 crossing-talk with PbrCPK32 probably participate in transporting of nitrate nutrition in pear root.
