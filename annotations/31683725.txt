<i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated genetic transformation is well established in the model grass <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>. However, most protocols employ immature embryos because of their better regenerative capacity. A major problem associated with the immature embryo system is that they are available only during a limited time window of growing plants. In this study, we have developed an optimized <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated genetic transformation protocol that utilizes mature embryos. We have adopted seed shearing and photoautotrophic rooting (PR) in callus induction and root regeneration, respectively, with evident significant improvement in these aspects. We have also revealed that the newly developed chemical inducer Fipexide (FPX) had the ability to induce callus, shoots, and roots. By comparison, we have demonstrated that FPX shows higher efficiency in shoot generation than other frequently used chemicals in our mature embryo-based system. In addition, we demonstrated that the age of embryogenetic callus severely affects the transformation efficiency (TE), with the seven-week-old embryogenetic callus having the highest TE reaching 52.6%, which is comparable with that in immature embryo transformation. The new methodologies reported here will advance the development and utilization of <i>Brachypodium</i> as a new model system for grass genomics.
