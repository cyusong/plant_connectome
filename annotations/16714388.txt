Although signals for vacuolar sorting of soluble proteins are well described, we have yet to learn how the plant vacuolar sorting receptor BP80 reaches its correct destination and recycles. To shed light on receptor targeting, we used an in vivo competition assay in which a truncated receptor (green fluorescent protein-BP80) specifically competes with sorting machinery and causes hypersecretion of BP80-ligands from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaf protoplasts. We show that both the transmembrane domain and the cytosolic tail of BP80 contain information necessary for efficient progress to the prevacuolar compartment (PVC). Furthermore, the tail must be exposed on the correct membrane surface to compete with sorting machinery. Mutational analysis of conserved residues revealed that multiple sequence motifs are necessary for competition, one of which is a typical Tyr-based motif (YXXPhi). Substitution of Tyr-612 for Ala causes partial retention in the Golgi apparatus, mistargeting to the plasma membrane (PM), and slower progress to the PVC. A role in Golgi-to-PVC transport was confirmed by generating the corresponding mutation on full-length BP80. The mutant receptor was partially mistargeted to the PM and induced the secretion of a coexpressed BP80-ligand. Further mutants indicate that the cytosolic tail is likely to contain other information besides the YXXPhi motif, possibly for endoplasmic reticulum export, endocytosis from the PM, and PVC-to-Golgi recycling.
