['27261463', 'Fimbrins/plastins have been implicated in the generation of distinct actin  structures, which are linked to different cellular processes. Historically,  fimbrins/plastins were mainly considered as generating tight actin bundles. Here,  we demonstrate that different members of the fimbrin/plastin family have diverged  biochemically during evolution to generate either tight actin bundles or loose  networks with distinct biochemical and biophysical properties. Using the  phylogenetically and functionally distinct Arabidopsis fimbrins FIM4 and FIM5 we  found that FIM4 generates both actin bundles and cross-linked actin filaments,  whereas FIM5 only generates actin bundles. The distinct functions of FIM4 and  FIM5 are clearly observed at single-filament resolution. Domain swapping  experiments showed that cooperation between the conformationally plastic  calponin-homology domain 2 (CH2) and the N-terminal headpiece determines the  function of the full-length protein. Our study suggests that the structural  plasticity of fimbrins/plastins has biologically meaningful consequences, and  provides novel insights into the structure-function relationship of  fimbrins/plastins as well as shedding light on how cells generate distinct actin  structures.', '2016 Aug 19', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M116.730069', 'ORCID:']
