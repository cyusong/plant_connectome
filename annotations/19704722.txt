One of the main components of pectin, a primary constituent of higher plant cell walls, is rhamnogalacturonan I. This polymer comprised of linked alternating rhamnose and galacturonic acid residues is decorated with side chains composed of arabinose and galactose residues. At present, the function of these side chains is not fully understood. Our research on Southern African resurrection plants, plants that are capable of surviving severe dehydration (desiccation), has revealed that their cell walls are capable of extreme flexibility in response to water loss. One species, Myrothamnus flabellifolia, has evolved a constitutively protected leaf cell wall, composed of an abundance of arabinose polymer side chains, suggested to be arabinans and/or arabinogalactans, associated with the pectin matrix. In this article, we propose a hypothetical model that explains how the arabinan rich pectin found in the leaves of this desiccation-tolerant plant permits almost complete water loss without deleterious consequences, such as irreversible polymer adhesion, from occurring. Recent evidence suggesting a role for pectin-associated arabinose polymers in relation to water dependent processes in other plant species is also discussed.
