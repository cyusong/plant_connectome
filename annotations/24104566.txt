['24104566', 'Effective plant defense strategies rely in part on the perception of non-self  determinants, so-called microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), by  transmembrane pattern recognition receptors leading to MAMP-triggered immunity.  Plant resistance against necrotrophic pathogens with a broad host range is  complex and yet not well understood. Particularly, it is unclear if resistance to  necrotrophs involves pattern recognition receptors. Here, we partially purified a  novel proteinaceous elicitor called sclerotinia culture filtrate elicitor1  (SCFE1) from the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum that  induces typical MAMP-triggered immune responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Analysis  of natural genetic variation revealed five Arabidopsis accessions (Mt-0, Lov-1,  Lov-5, Br-0, and Sq-1) that are fully insensitive to the SCFE1-containing  fraction. We used a forward genetics approach and mapped the locus determining  SCFE1 sensitivity to receptor-like protein30 (RLP30). We also show that  SCFE1-triggered immune responses engage a signaling pathway dependent on the  regulatory receptor-like kinases brassinosteroid insensitive1-associated receptor  kinase1 (BAK1) and Suppressor of BIR1-1/evershed (SOBIR1/EVR). Mutants of RLP30,  BAK1, and SOBIR1 are more susceptible to S. sclerotiorum and the related fungus  Botrytis cinerea. The presence of an elicitor in S. sclerotiorum evoking  MAMP-triggered immune responses and sensed by RLP30/SOBIR1/BAK1 demonstrates the  relevance of MAMP-triggered immunity in resistance to necrotrophic fungi.', '2013 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.117010', 'Brunner']
