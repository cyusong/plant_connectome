['15923351', 'AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) is one of five ARF transcriptional activators in  Arabidopsis thaliana that is proposed to regulate auxin-responsive expression of  genes containing TGTCTC auxin response elements in their promoters. An  Arabidopsis mutant (nonphototropic hypocotyl4-1 [nph4-1]) that is a null for ARF7  showed strongly reduced expression of integrated auxin-responsive reporter genes  and natural genes that were monitored in Arabidopsis leaf mesophyll protoplasts.  Expression of the reporter and natural genes was restored in an auxin-dependent  manner when protoplasts were transfected with a 35S:ARF7 effector gene, encoding  a full-length ARF7 protein. Transfection of effector genes encoding other ARF  activators restored auxin-responsive gene expression to varying degrees, but less  than that observed with the ARF7 effector gene. Arabidopsis lines that were null  for ARF6, ARF8, or ARF19 were not defective in expression of the reporter and  natural auxin response genes assayed in mesophyll protoplasts, suggesting that  ARF7 plays a major role in regulating expression of a subset of auxin response  genes in leaf mesophyll cells. Auxin-responsive gene expression was induced in  wild-type protoplasts and restored in nph4-1 protoplasts only with auxin and not  with other hormones, including brassinolide. In the presence of auxin, however,  brassinolide modestly enhanced auxin-responsive gene expression.', '2005 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.031096', 'Guilfoyle']
