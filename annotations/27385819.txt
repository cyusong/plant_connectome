Plants as sessile organisms have developed prompt response mechanisms to react to rapid environmental changes. In addition to the transcriptional regulation of gene expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) are key posttranscriptional regulators of the plant stress response. We show here that the expression levels of many miRNAs were regulated under salt stress conditions. This regulation occurred at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. During salinity stress, the levels of miRNA161 and miRNA173 increased, while the expression of pri-miRNA161 and pri-miRNA173 was down-regulated. Under salt stress conditions, miRNA161 and miRNA173 were stabilized in the cytoplasm, and the expressions of MIR161 and MIR173 were negatively regulated in the nucleus. ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) participated in both processes. We demonstrated that AGO1 cotranscriptionally controlled the expression of MIR161 and MIR173 in the nucleus. Our results suggests that AGO1 interacts with chromatin at MIR161 and MIR173 loci and causes the disassembly of the transcriptional complex, releasing short and unpolyadenylated transcripts.
