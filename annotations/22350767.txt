Water-soluble chlorophyll protein (WSCP) has been found in many Brassicaceae, most often in leaves. In many cases, its expression is stress-induced, therefore, it is thought to be involved in some stress response. In this work, recombinant WSCP from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtWSCP) is found to form chlorophyll-protein complexes in vitro that share many properties with recombinant or native WSCP from Brassica oleracea, BoWSCP, including an unusual heat resistance up to 100°C in aqueous solution. A polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant apoprotein is used to identify plant tissues expressing AtWSCP. The only plant organs containing significant amounts of AtWSCP are the gynoecium in open flowers and the septum of developing siliques, specifically the transmission tract. In fully grown but still green siliques, the protein has almost disappeared. Possible implications for AtWSCP functions are discussed.

AtWSCP: !forms! chlorophyll-protein complexes 
AtWSCP: !localizes to! gynoecium and septum of developing siliques 
AtWSCP: !disappears from! fully grown green siliques
