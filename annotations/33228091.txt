Endophytic bacteria hold tremendous potential for use as biocontrol agents. Our study aimed to investigate the biocontrol activity of <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> BRZ63, a new endophyte of oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.) against <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> W70, <i>Colletotrichum dematium</i> K, <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> K2291, and <i>Fusarium avenaceum</i>. In addition, features crucial for biocontrol, plant growth promotion, and colonization were assessed and linked with the genome sequences. The in vitro tests showed that BRZ63 significantly inhibited the mycelium growth of all tested pathogens and stimulated germination and growth of oilseed rape seedlings treated with fungal pathogens. The BRZ63 strain can benefit plants by producing biosurfactants, siderophores, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, and ammonia as well as phosphate solubilization. The abilities of exopolysaccharide production, autoaggregation, and biofilm formation additionally underline its potential to plant colonization and hence biocontrol. The effective colonization properties of the BRZ63 strain were confirmed by microscopy observations of EGFP-expressing cells colonizing the root surface and epidermal cells of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Col-0. Genome mining identified many genes related to the biocontrol process, such as transporters, siderophores, and other secondary metabolites. All analyses revealed that the BRZ63 strain is an excellent endophytic candidate for biocontrol of various plant pathogens and plant growth promotion.
