Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important regulatory roles in caryopsis development and grain size in rice. However, whether there exist differences in lncRNA expression between caryopses located on primary branches (CPB) and caryopses located on secondary branches (CSB) that contribute to their differential development remains elusive. Here, we performed transcriptome-wide analysis to identify 2,273 lncRNAs expressed in CPB and CSB at 0, 5, 12, and 20 days after flowering (DAF). Although these lncRNAs were widely distributed, the majority were located in intergenic regions of the 12 rice chromosomes. Based on gene expression cluster analysis, lncRNAs expressed in CPB and CSB were clustered into two subtypes in a position-independent manner: one includes 0- and 5-DAF CPB and CSB, and 12-DAF CSB; the second includes 12-DAF CPB and 20-DAF CPB and CSB. Furthermore, according to the expression value of each lncRNA, K-means cluster analysis revealed 135 early-stage, 116 middle-stage, and 114 late-stage expression-delayed lncRNAs in CSB. Then, we analyzed the expression values of the expression-delayed lncRNAs and nearby coding genes (100 kb upstream and downstream of the lncRNAs), and found 631 lncRNA-mRNA pairs, including 258 lncRNAs and 571 nearby coding genes, some of which are related to hormone-regulated grain development. These results suggested that expression-delayed lncRNAs in CSB may regulate the development of CPB and CSB, providing insight into the mechanism underlying the developmental differences between CPB and CSB, and the differences in grain yield.
