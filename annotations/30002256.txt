['30002256', 'During the leptotene stage of prophase I of meiosis, chromatids become organized  into a linear looped array via a protein axis that forms along the loop bases.  Establishment of the axis is essential for the subsequent synapsis of the  homologous chromosome pairs and the progression of recombination to form genetic  crossovers. Here, we describe ASYNAPTIC4 (ASY4), a meiotic axis protein in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). ASY4 is a small coiled-coil protein that  exhibits limited sequence similarity with the carboxyl-terminal region of the  axis protein ASY3. We used enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged ASY4 to  show that ASY4 localizes to the chromosome axis throughout prophase I.  Bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that ASY4 interacts with ASY1  and ASY3, and yeast two-hybrid analysis confirmed a direct interaction between  ASY4 and ASY3. Mutants lacking full-length ASY4 exhibited defective axis  formation and were unable to complete synapsis. Although the initiation of  recombination appeared to be unaffected in the asy4 mutant, the number of  crossovers was reduced significantly, and crossovers tended to group in the  distal parts of the chromosomes. We conclude that ASY4 is required for normal  axis and crossover formation. Furthermore, our data suggest that ASY3/ASY4 are  the functional homologs of the mammalian SYCP2/SYCP3 axial components.', '2018 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.01725', 'ORCID:']
