The nuclear genomes of photosynthetic eukaryotes are littered with genes derived from the cyanobacterial progenitor of modern-day plastids. A genomic analysis of Cyanophora paradoxa - a deeply diverged unicellular alga - suggests that the abundance and functional diversity of nucleus-encoded genes of cyanobacterial origin differs in plants and algae.
