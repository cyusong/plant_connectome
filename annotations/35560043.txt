Mycorrhizal associations between fungi and plant roots have globally significant impacts on nutrient cycling. Mucoromycotina 'fine root endophytes' (MFRE) are a distinct and recently characterised group of mycorrhiza-forming fungi that associate with the roots of a range of host plant species. Given their previous misidentification and assignment as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) of the Glomeromycotina, it is now important to untangle the specific form and function of MFRE symbioses. In particular, relatively little is known about the nature of MFRE colonisation and its role in N uptake and transfer to host plants. Even less is known about the mechanisms by which MFRE access and assimilate N, and how this N is processed and subsequently exchanged with host plants for photosynthates. Here, we summarise and contrast the structures formed by MFRE and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in host plants as well as compare the N source preference of each mycorrhizal fungal group with what is currently known for MFRE N uptake. We compare the mechanisms of N assimilation and transfer to host plants utilised by the main groups of mycorrhizal fungi and hypothesise potential mechanisms for MFRE N assimilation and transfer, outlining directions for future research.
