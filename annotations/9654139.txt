['9654139', 'A cDNA encoding a glutamine amidotransferase and cyclase catalyzing the fifth and  sixth steps of the histidine (His) biosynthetic pathway has been isolated from  Arabidopsis thaliana. The N- and C-terminal domains of the primary structure  deduced from a full-length Arabidopsis hisHF (At-HF) cDNA showed significant  homology to the glutamine amidotransferase and cyclase of microorganisms,  respectively. Effective suppression of the His auxotrophy of a Saccharomyces  cerevisiae his7 mutant with the At-HF cDNA confirmed that the At-HF protein has  bifunctional glutamine amidotransferase (HisH) and cyclase (HisF) activities.', '1998 May 29', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00535-3', 'Ohta']
