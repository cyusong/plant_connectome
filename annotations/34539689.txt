The growing concerns on human and environment health are forcing the plant protection industry toward the formulation of more eco-sustainable plant protection products (PPP), both efficient and innovative in their approach to disease control. A large number of these innovative formulations now rely on a combination of pathogens antagonistic properties and stimulation of natural plant defense to pathogens. The formulation HA + Cu(II), in which copper is delivered to the plants by the drug-delivery molecule hydroxyapatite (HA), was found efficient against the grapevine pathogens <i>Plasmopara viticola</i> and <i>Phaeoacremonium minimum</i> and able to induce the host-plant defense system. We investigated the HA + Cu(II) impacts on grapevine physiology, both in uninfected and when infected by the Botryosphaeria dieback agents <i>Diplodia seriata</i> and <i>Neofusicoccum parvum</i>. This study of plant physiology and disease impact were addressed to evaluate both the HA + Cu(II) potential as a plant defense elicitor and its possible and future use as PPP in vineyard. Our results showed that HA + Cu(II) induced several key-defense genes without negatively affecting plant growth and photosynthetic activity. In addition, fungistatic effect on the two <i>Botryosphaeriaceae</i> at the <i>in planta</i> tested concentrations is reported. Altogether, our results obtained under controlled conditions fully support the potential of HA + Cu(II) as a promising PPP toward grapevine trunk diseases in vineyard.
