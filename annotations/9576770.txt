['9576770', 'A mechanism that confers increased Al resistance in the Arabidopsis thaliana  mutant alr-104 was investigated. A modified vibrating microelectrode system was  used to measure H+ fluxes generated along the surface of small Arabidopsis roots.  In the absence of Al, no differences in root H+ fluxes between wild type and  alr-104 were detected. However, Al exposure induced a 2-fold increase in net H+  influx in alr-104 localized to the root tip. The increased flux raised the root  surface pH of alr-104 by 0.15 unit. A root growth assay was used to assess the Al  resistance of alr-104 and wild type in a strongly pH-buffered nutrient solution.  Increasing the nutrient solution pH from 4.4 to 4.5 significantly increased Al  resistance in wild type, which is consistent with the idea that the increased net  H+ influx can account for greater Al resistance in alr-104. Differences in Al  resistance between wild type and alr-104 disappeared when roots were grown in  pH-buffered medium, suggesting that Al resistance in alr-104 is mediated only by  pH changes in the rhizosphere. This mutant provides the first evidence, to our  knowledge, for an Al-resistance mechanism based on an Al-induced increase in root  surface pH.', '1998 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.117.1.19', 'Kochian']
