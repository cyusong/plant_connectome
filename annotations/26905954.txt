In Arabidopsis, the MYB (myeloblastosis) gene family contains more than 190 members, which play a number of roles in plant growth and development. Based on their protein structure, this gene family was divided into several subclasses, including the MYB-related class. Currently, an MYB-related gene designated as MYB-like Domain (AtMYBD) has been shown to function as a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. This gene was found to belong to the CCA1-like (circadian clock-associated 1) group, which represents several genes that are master regulators of the circadian clocks of plants. Here, we speculate that AtMYBD is able to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana in a circadian clock-related manner.
