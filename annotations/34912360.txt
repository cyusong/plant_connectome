Elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations ([eCO<sub>2</sub>]) and soil water deficits significantly influence gas exchange in plant leaves, affecting the carbon-water cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how the soil water deficit modulates the plant CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effect, especially for gas exchange and leaf-level water use efficiency (WUE). Here, we synthesized a comprehensive dataset including 554 observations from 54 individual studies and quantified the responses for leaf gas exchange induced by e[CO<sub>2</sub>] under water deficit. Moreover, we investigated the contribution of plant net photosynthesis rate (<i>P</i> <sub><i>n</i></sub> ) and transpiration rates (<i>T</i> <sub>r</sub>) toward WUE in water deficit conditions and e[CO<sub>2</sub>] using graphical vector analysis (GVA). In summary, e[CO<sub>2</sub>] significantly increased <i>P</i> <sub>n</sub> and WUE by 11.9 and 29.3% under well-watered conditions, respectively, whereas the interaction of water deficit and e[CO<sub>2</sub>] slightly decreased <i>P</i> <sub>n</sub> by 8.3%. Plants grown under light in an open environment were stimulated to a greater degree compared with plants grown under a lamp in a closed environment. Meanwhile, water deficit reduced <i>P</i> <sub>n</sub> by 40.5 and 37.8%, while increasing WUE by 24.5 and 21.5% under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (a[CO<sub>2</sub>]) and e[CO<sub>2</sub>], respectively. The e[CO<sub>2</sub>]-induced stimulation of WUE was attributed to the common effect of <i>P</i> <sub>n</sub> and <i>T</i> <sub>r</sub>, whereas a water deficit induced increase in WUE was linked to the decrease in <i>T</i> <sub>r</sub>. These results suggested that water deficit lowered the stimulation of e[CO<sub>2</sub>] induced in plants. Therefore, fumigation conditions that closely mimic field conditions and multi-factorial experiments such as water availability are needed to predict the response of plants to future climate change.
