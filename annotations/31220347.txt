Due to its ability to accept and donate electrons, iron (Fe) is an indispensable component of electron transport chains and a cofactor in many vital enzymes. Except for waterlogged conditions, under which the lack of oxygen prevents oxidation and precipitation of iron as Fe<sup>3+</sup> hydroxides, the availability of iron in soils is generally far below the plant's demand for optimal growth. Plants have evolved two phylogenetically separated and elaborately regulated strategies to mobilize iron from the soil, featuring mechanisms which are thought to be mutually exclusive. However, recent studies uncovered several shared components of the two strategies, questioning the validity of the concept of mutual exclusivity. Here, we use publicly available data obtained from the model species rice (Oryza sativa) to unveil similarities and incongruities between co-expression networks derived from transcriptomic profiling of iron-deficient rice and Arabidopsis plants. This approach revealed striking similarities in the topographies of the resulting co-expression networks with relatively minor deviations in the molecular attributes of the comprised genes, which nonetheless lead to different physiological functions. The analysis also discovered several novel players that are possibly involved in the regulation plant adaptation to iron deficiency.
