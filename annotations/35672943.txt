Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation (SUMOylation) is a reversible post-translational modification associated with protein stability and activity, and modulates hormone signaling and stress responses in plants. Previously, we reported that the pepper dehydration-responsive homeobox domain transcription factor CaDRHB1 acts as a positive modulator of drought response. Here, we show that CaDRHB1 protein stability is enhanced by SUMO E3 ligase Capsicum annuum DRHB1-interacting SAP and Miz domain (SIZ1) (CaDSIZ1)-mediated SUMOylation in response to drought, thereby positively modulating abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and drought responses. Substituting lysine (K) 138 of CaDRHB1 with arginine reduced CaDSIZ1-mediated SUMOylation, indicating that K138 is the principal site for SUMO conjugation. Virus-induced silencing of CaDSIZ1 promoted CaDRHB1 degradation, suggesting that CaDSIZ1 is involved in drought-induced SUMOylation of CaDRHB1. CaDSIZ1 interacted with and facilitated SUMO conjugation of CaDRHB1. CaDRHB1, mainly localized in the nucleus, but also in the cytoplasm in the SUMOylation mimic state, suggesting that SUMOylation of CaDRHB1 promotes its nuclear export, leading to cytoplasmic accumulation. Moreover, CaDSIZ1-silenced pepper plants were less sensitive to ABA and considerably sensitive to drought stress, whereas CaDSIZ1-overexpressing plants displayed ABA-hypersensitive and drought-tolerant phenotypes. Collectively, our data indicate that CaDSIZ1-mediated SUMOylation of CaDRHB1 functions in ABA-mediated drought tolerance.
