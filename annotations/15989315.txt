['15989315', '[reaction: see text] The dammarenyl cation (13) is the last common intermediate  in the cyclization of oxidosqualene to a diverse array of secondary triterpene  metabolites in plants. We studied the structure and reactivity of 13 to  understand the factors governing the regio- and stereospecificity of triterpene  synthesis. First, we demonstrated that 13 has a 17beta side chain in Arabidopsis  thaliana lupeol synthase (LUP1) by incubating the substrate analogue  (18E)-22,23-dihydro-20-oxaoxidosqualene (21) with LUP1 from a recombinant yeast  strain devoid of other cyclases and showing that the sole product of 21 was  3beta-hydroxy-22,23,24,25,26,27-hexanor-17beta-dammaran-20-one. Quantum  mechanical calculations were carried out on gas-phase models to show that the  20-oxa substitution has negligible effect on substrate binding and on the  activation energies of reactions leading to either C17 epimer of 13. Further  molecular modeling indicated that, because of limited rotational freedom in the  cyclase active site cavity, the C17 configuration of the tetracyclic intermediate  13 can be deduced from the angular methyl configuration of the pentacyclic or  6-6-6-6 tetracyclic product. This rule of configurational transmission aided in  elucidating the mechanistic pathway accessed by individual cyclases. Grouping of  cyclases according to mechanistic and taxonomic criteria suggested that the  transition between pathways involving 17alpha and 17beta intermediates occurred  rarely in evolutionary history. Two other mechanistic changes were also rare,  whereas variations on cation rearrangements evolved readily. This perspective  furnished insights into the phylogenetic relationships of triterpene synthases.', '2005 Jul 8', 'J Org Chem', '10.1021/jo050147e', 'Matsuda']
