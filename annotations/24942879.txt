['24942879', 'Heat shock proteins (HSPs) refold damaged proteins and are an essential component  of the heat shock response. Previously, the 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) has  been reported to translocate into the nucleus in a heat-dependent manner in many  organisms. In humans, the heat-induced translocation of HSP70 requires the  nuclear carrier protein Hikeshi. In the Arabidopsis genome, only one gene encodes  a protein with high homology to Hikeshi, and we named this homolog Hikeshi-like  (HKL) protein. In this study, we show that two Arabidopsis HSP70 isoforms  accumulate in the nucleus in response to heat shock and that HKL interacts with  these HSP70s. Our histochemical analysis revealed that HKL is predominantly  expressed in meristematic tissues, suggesting the potential importance of HKL  during cell division in Arabidopsis. In addition, we show that HKL regulates  HSP70 localization, and HKL overexpression conferred thermotolerance to  transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Our results suggest that HKL plays a positive role  in the thermotolerance of Arabidopsis plants and cooperatively interacts with  HSP70.', '2014 Jul 18', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.05.128', 'Yamaguchi-Shinozaki']
