['16384903', 'Light is arguably the most important resource for plants, and an array of  photosensory pigments enables plants to develop optimally in a broad range of  ambient-light conditions. The red- and far-red-light-absorbing photosensory  pigments or phytochromes (phy) regulate seedling deetiolation responses,  photoperiodic flowering, and circadian rhythm. We have identified a long  hypocotyl mutant under red and far-red light, rfi2-1 (red and far-red insensitive  2 to 1). rfi2-1 was also impaired in phytochrome-mediated end-of-day far-red  light response, cotyledon expansion, far-red light block of greening, and  light-induced expression of CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN 3 and CHALCONE  SYNTHASE. Introduction of rfi2-1 mutation into phyB-9 or phyA-211 did not enhance  or suppress the long hypocotyl phenotype of phyB-9 or phyA-211 under red or  far-red light, respectively, and RFI2 likely functions downstream of phyB or  phyA. RFI2 was identified through the segregation of two T-DNA insertions into  different recombinant lines, genetic rescue, and phenotypic characterization of a  second mutant allele rfi2-2. RFI2 encodes a protein with a C3H2C3-type zinc  finger or RING domain known to mediate protein-protein or protein-DNA  interactions, and RFI2 is localized to the nucleus. RFI2 therefore reveals a  signaling step that mediates phytochrome control of seedling deetiolation.', '2006 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.073163', 'Ni']
