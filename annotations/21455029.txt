Callose is the primary polysaccharide present in the so-called secondary layer of the pollen tube cell wall while the content of cellulose in such layer is usually lower. Despite its lower quantity, cellulose might be potentially able to establish the growth direction of pollen tubes. Microtubules have been shown to regulate the deposition of callose synthase in the distal regions of pollen tubes related to the synthesis of callose plugs. However, the interplay between microtubules and cellulose synthase in the pollen tube is unclear. Here, the hypothetical role of microtubules and microtubule-based motor proteins in controlling the insertion of cellulose synthase in relation with growth and directionality of pollen tubes is discussed.
