['15848163', 'In plant chloroplasts two superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities occur, FeSOD and  Cu/ZnSOD, with reciprocal regulation in response to copper availability. This  system presents a unique model to study the regulation of metal-cofactor delivery  to an organelle. The Arabidopsis thaliana gene AtCCS encodes a functional homolog  to yeast Ccs1p/Lys7p, a copper chaperone for SOD. The AtCCS protein was localized  to chloroplasts where it may supply copper to the stromal Cu/ZnSOD. AtCCS mRNA  expression levels are upregulated in response to Cu-feeding and senescence. We  propose that AtCCS expression is regulated to allow the most optimal use of Cu  for photosynthesis.', '2005 Apr 25', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2005.03.025', 'Pilon']
