The production of high-quality coffee is being challenged by changing climates in coffee-growing regions. The coffee beans from the upper and lower canopy at different development stages of the same plants were analyzed to investigate the impact of the microenvironment on gene expression and coffee quality. Compared with coffee beans from the upper canopy, lower canopy beans displayed more intense aroma with higher caffeine, trigonelline, and sucrose contents, associated with greater gene expression in the representative metabolic pathways. Global gene expression indicated a longer ripening in the lower canopy, resulting from higher expression of genes relating to growth inhibition and suppression of chlorophyll degradation during early bean ripening. Selection of genotypes or environments that enhance expression of the genes slowing bean development may produce higher quality coffee beans, allowing coffee production in a broader range of available future environments.
