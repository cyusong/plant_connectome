In a world where climate change is real and its consequences are unprecedented, understanding of the plant adaptive capacity and native stress-responsive machinery is crucial. In recent years, universal stress proteins (USPs) have received much attention in the field of plant science due to their stress-specific transcriptional regulation. This study focuses on the extensive characterization of the <i>USP</i> gene family members in the monocot crop rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L. var. <i>japonica</i>). Here, we report a total of 44 <i>USP</i> genes in the rice genome. <i>In silico</i> characterization of these genes showed that domain architecture played a major role in the functional diversification of the <i>USP</i> gene family which holds for all plant <i>USPs</i>. On top of that, a higher conservation of <i>OsUSP</i> members has been exhibited with a monocot genome (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) as compared to a dicot genome (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> L.). Expression profiling of the identified genes led to the discovery of multiple <i>OsUSP</i> genes that showed pronounced transcript alteration under various abiotic stress conditions, indicating their potential role as multi-functional stress-specific modules. Furthermore, expression validation of <i>OsUSP</i> genes using qRT-PCR provided a strong evidence for the utility <i>OsUSP</i> genes in building multi-stress tolerant plants. Altogether, this study provides leads to suitable <i>USP</i> candidates that could be targeted for plant breeding and genetic engineering experiments to develop stress resilient crop species.
