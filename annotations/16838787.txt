Plant defense responses against pathogens often involve the restriction of the pathogen to its site of penetration achieved through the combined effects of the hypersensitive response (HR) and its tightly connected localized acquired resistance (LAR). The tobacco DD9-3 expressed sequence tag was previously isolated from a screen designed to isolate genes induced early during the HR, thus potentially involved in the induction/regulation of the HR or LAR. Translation of the open reading frame of DD9-3 revealed a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain highly homologous with the receptor domain of a receptor kinase, suggesting a potential function in signaling pathways. The full-length cDNA was cloned. It encodes a small (232 amino acids) LRR protein, designated Nicotiana tabacum leucine-rich protein 1 (NtLRP1), containing a signal peptide, four leucine zipper repeats, five LRR repeats, and a C-terminal domain rich in proline. NtLRP1 expression is induced early during the HR initiated by elicitins, Ralstonia solanacearum, or Tobacco mosaic virus. NtLRP1 coupled with the green fluorescent protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss-of-function through virus-induced gene silencing or through RNA interference did not modify the elicitin-induced HR or LAR. Gain-of-function experiments through transient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated NtLRP1 expression in tobacco leaves caused the suppression of the HR induced by 2 nM elicitin and delayed the HR when the elicitin was applied at higher concentrations. The results suggest that NtLRP1 acts as a modulator of the HR and that retention in the ER is essential for its function.
