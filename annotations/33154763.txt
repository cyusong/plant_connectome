Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) play pivotal roles in transducing developmental cues and environmental signals into cellular responses through pathways initiated by MAPK kinase kinases (MAP3K). AtYODA is a MAP3K of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that controls stomatal development and non-canonical immune responses. <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants overexpressing a constitutively active YODA protein (<i>AtCA-YDA</i>) show broad-spectrum disease resistance and constitutive expression of defensive genes. We tested YDA function in crops immunity by heterologously overexpressing <i>AtCA-YDA</i> in <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>. We found that these tomato <i>AtCA-YDA</i> plants do not show developmental phenotypes and fitness alterations, except a reduction in stomatal index, as reported in <i>Arabidopsis AtCA-YDA</i> plants. Notably, <i>AtCA-YDA</i> tomato plants show enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 and constitutive upregulation of defense-associated genes, corroborating the functionality of YDA in tomato immunity. This function was further supported by generating CRISPR/Cas9-edited tomato mutants impaired in the closest orthologs of <i>AtYDA</i> [<i>Solyc08g081210</i> (<i>SlYDA1</i>) and <i>Solyc03g025360</i> (<i>SlYDA2</i>)]. <i>Slyda1</i> and <i>Slyda2</i> mutants are highly susceptible to <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> DC3000 in comparison to wild-type plants but only <i>Slyda2</i> shows altered stomatal index. These results indicate that tomato orthologs have specialized functions and support that YDA also regulates immune responses in tomato and may be a trait for breeding disease resistance.
