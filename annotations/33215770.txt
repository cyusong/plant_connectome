A collection of small molecules called strigolactones (SLs) act as both endogenous hormones to control plant development and as ecological communication cues between organisms. SL signalling overlaps with that of a class of smoke-derived compounds, karrikins (KARs), which have distinct yet overlapping developmental effects on plants. Although the roles of SLs in shoot and root development, in the promotion of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal branching and in parasitic plant germination have been well characterized, recent data have illustrated broader roles for these compounds in the rhizosphere. Here, we review the known roles of SLs in development, growth of AM fungi and germination of parasitic plants to develop a framework for understanding the use of SLs as molecules of communication in the rhizosphere. It appears, for example, that there are many connections between SLs and phosphate utilization. Low phosphate levels regulate SL metabolism and, in turn, SLs sculpt root and shoot architecture to coordinate growth and optimize phosphate uptake from the environment. Plant-exuded SLs attract fungal symbionts to deliver inorganic phosphate (Pi) to the host. These and other examples suggest the boundary between exogenous and endogenous SL functions can be easily blurred and a more holistic view of these small molecules is likely to be required to fully understand SL biology. Related to this, we summarize and discuss evidence for a primitive role of SLs in moss as a quorum sensing-like molecule, providing a unifying concept of SLs as endogenous and exogenous signalling molecules.
