In Arabidopsis, phosphate starvation (-Pi)-induced responses of primary root and lateral root growth are documented to be correlated with ambient iron (Fe) status. However, whether and how Fe participates in -Pi-induced root hair growth (RHG) remains unclear. Here, responses of RHG to different Fe concentrations under Pi sufficiency/deficiency were verified. Generally, distinct dosage effects of Fe on RHG appeared at both Pi levels, due to the generation of reactive oxygen species. Following analyses using auxin mutants and the phr1 mutant revealed that auxin and the central regulator PHR1 are required for Fe-triggered RHG under -Pi. A further proteomic study indicated that processes of vesicle trafficking and auxin synthesis and transport were affected by Fe under -Pi, which were subsequently validated by using a vesicle trafficking inhibitor, brefeldin A, and an auxin reporter, R2D2. Moreover, vesicle trafficking-mediated recycling of PIN2, an auxin efflux transporter, was notably affected by Fe under -Pi. Correspondingly, root hairs of pin2 mutant displayed attenuated responses to Fe under -Pi. Together, we propose that Fe affects auxin signalling probably by modulating vesicle trafficking, chiefly the PIN2 recycling, which might work jointly with PHR1 on modulating -Pi-induced RHG.
