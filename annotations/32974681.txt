Iron (Fe) deficiency in humans is a widespread problem worldwide. Fe biofortification of rice (Oryza sativa) is a promising approach to address human Fe deficiency. Since its conceptualization, various biofortification strategies have been developed, some of which have resulted in significant increases in grain Fe concentration. However, there are still many aspects that have not yet been addressed in the studies to date. In this review, we first overview the important rice Fe biofortification strategies reported to date and the complications associated with them. Next, we highlight the key outstanding questions and hypotheses related to rice Fe biofortification. Finally, we make suggestions for the direction of future rice biofortification studies.
