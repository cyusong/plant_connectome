Boreal forests undergo a strong seasonal photosynthetic cycle; however, the underlying processes remain incompletely characterized. Here, we present a novel analysis of the seasonal diffusional and biochemical limits to photosynthesis (A<sub>net</sub> ) relative to temperature and light limitations in high-latitude mature Pinus sylvestris, including a high-resolution analysis of the seasonality of mesophyll conductance (g<sub>m</sub> ) and its effect on the estimation of carboxylation capacity ( <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>C</mi><mo>max</mo></msub></msub></math> ). We used a custom-built gas-exchange system coupled to a carbon isotope analyser to obtain continuous measurements for the estimation of the relevant shoot gas-exchange parameters and quantified the biochemical and diffusional controls alongside the environmental controls over A<sub>net</sub> . The seasonality of A<sub>net</sub> was strongly dependent on <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>C</mi><mo>max</mo></msub></msub></math> and the diffusional limitations. Stomatal limitation was low in spring and autumn but increased to 31% in June. By contrast, mesophyll limitation was nearly constant (19%). We found that <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>C</mi><mo>max</mo></msub></msub></math> limited A<sub>net</sub> in the spring, whereas daily temperatures and the gradual reduction of light availability limited A<sub>net</sub> in the autumn, despite relatively high <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>C</mi><mo>max</mo></msub></msub></math> . We describe for the first time the role of mesophyll conductance in connection with seasonal trends in net photosynthesis of P. sylvestris, revealing a strong coordination between g<sub>m</sub> and A<sub>net</sub> , but not between g<sub>m</sub> and stomatal conductance.
