A subset of homeodomain leucine zipper proteins (HDZip) play a role in regulating adaptation responses including developmental adjustment to environmental cues in plants. Here we report the structural and functional characterisation of a dehydration responsive nuclear-targeted HDZip transcriptional regulator, CpHB-7. DNA-protein interaction studies suggest that CDeT6-19, a known ABA and dehydration responsive dehydrin gene, is a potential target gene of CpHB-7 in the desiccation-tolerant plant Craterostigma plantagineum. Transgenic plants that ectopically express CpHB-7 display reduced sensitivity towards ABA during seed germination and stomatal closure. Expression analysis reveals that genes with induced or repressed expression in CpHB-7 ectopic expression lines are either mostly repressed or induced by ABA, drought or salt treatment respectively, thus demonstrating that CpHB-7 modifies ABA-responsive gene expression as a negative regulator. CpHB-7 gene expression is also linked to early organ development, leading to the suggestion that CpHB-7 is functionally similar to the Arabidopsis transcription factor, ATHB-6.
