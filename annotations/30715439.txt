Small secreted peptides are important players in plant development and stress response. Using a targeted in silico approach, we identified a family of 14 Arabidopsis genes encoding precursors of serine-rich endogenous peptides (PROSCOOP). Transcriptomic analyses revealed that one member of this family, PROSCOOP12, is involved in processes linked to biotic and oxidative stress as well as root growth. Plants defective in this gene were less susceptible to Erwinia amylovora infection and showed an enhanced root growth phenotype. In PROSCOOP12 we identified a conserved motif potentially coding for a small secreted peptide. Exogenous application of synthetic SCOOP12 peptide induces various defense responses in Arabidopsis. Our findings show that SCOOP12 has numerous properties of phytocytokines, activates the phospholipid signaling pathway, regulates reactive oxygen species response, and is perceived in a BAK1 co-receptor-dependent manner.
