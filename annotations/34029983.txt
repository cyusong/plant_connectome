Measuring polar auxin transport (PAT) in plants and drawing conclusions from the observed transport data is only meaningful if these data are being analysed with a mathematical model which describes PAT. In this report we studied the polar auxin transport in Panax ginseng stems of different age and grown on different substrates. We measured polar IAA transport in stems using a radio labelled IAA and analysed the transport data with a mathematical model we developed for Arabidopsis. We found that PAT in ginseng stems, as compared to Arabidopsis inflorescence stems, has a 2-fold lower transport velocity and a 3-fold lower steady state auxin flux. We were able to pinpoint two physiological parameters that influenced the observed transport characteristics in ginseng which differ from Arabidopsis, namely an increase in immobilization together with a reduced reflux of IAA from the surrounding tissue back to the transporting cells.
