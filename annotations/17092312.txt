EMB506 is a chloroplast protein essential for embryo development, the function of which is unknown. A two-hybrid interaction screen was performed to provide insight into the role of EMB506. A single interacting partner, AKRP, was identified among a cDNA library from immature siliques. The AKR gene (Zhang et al., 1992, Plant Cell 4, 1575-1588) encodes a protein containing five ankyrin repeats, very similar to EMB506. Protein truncation series demonstrated that both proteins interact through their ankyrin domains. Using reverse genetics, we showed that loss of akr function resulted in an embryo-defective (emb) phenotype indistinguishable from the emb506 phenotype. Transient expression of the signal peptide of AKRP fused to green fluorescent protein demonstrated the chloroplast localization of AKRP. The ABI3 promoter was used to express AKR in a seed-specific manner in order to analyse the post-embryonic effect of AKR loss of function in akr/akr seedlings. Homozygous fertile and viable akr/akr plants were obtained. These plants exhibited mild to severe defects in chloroplast and leaf cellular organization. We conclude that EMB506 and AKRP are involved in crucial and tightly controlled events in plastid differentiation linked to cell differentiation, morphogenesis and organogenesis during the plant life cycle.
