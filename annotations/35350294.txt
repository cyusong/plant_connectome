Lipid-soluble tanshinone is one of the main bioactive substances in the medicinal plant <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i>, and its medicinal demand is growing rapidly. Yeast extract (YE) modulates the tanshinone biosynthesis, but the underlying regulatory network remains obscure. In this study, a YE-responsive transcriptional factor Scarecrow1 (<i>SCR1</i>) was identified in <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> from the YE-induced transcriptome dataset. <i>SmSCR1</i> is located in the nucleus. Overexpression of <i>SmSCR1</i> in <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i> roots resulted in a significantly higher accumulation of tanshinone than the control, with the highest 1.49-fold increase. We also detected upregulation of tanshinone biosynthetic genes, <i>SmSCR1</i> and <i>SmHMGR1</i>, and distinct alteration of growth and development of the hairy roots in the overexpression lines compared to the control. An inverse phenotype was observed in <i>SmSCR1</i>-SRDX suppression expression lines. We found that <i>SmSCR1</i> can bind to the promoter of <i>SmCPS1</i> to induce its expression. This study provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism on the growth and development of hairy roots, tanshinone accumulation, and the metabolic engineering of bioactive compounds in <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i>.
