Auxin plays a central role in controlling plant cell growth and morphogenesis. Application of auxin to light-grown seedlings elicits both axial growth and transverse patterning of the cortical microtubule cytoskeleton in hypocotyl cells. Microtubules respond to exogenous auxin within 5 min, although repatterning of the array does not initiate until 30 min after application and is complete by 2 h. To examine the requirements for auxin-induced microtubule array patterning, we used an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) double <i>auxin f-box</i> (<i>afb</i>) receptor mutant, <i>afb4-8 afb5-5</i>, that responds to conventional auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) but has a strongly diminished response to the auxin analog, picloram. We show that 5 µm picloram induces immediate changes to microtubule density and later transverse microtubule patterning in wild-type plants, but does not cause microtubule array reorganization in the <i>afb4-8 afb5-5</i> mutant. Additionally, a dominant mutant (<i>axr2-1</i>) for the auxin coreceptor AUXIN RESPONSIVE2 (AXR2) was strongly suppressed for auxin-induced microtubule array reorganization, providing additional evidence that auxin functions through a transcriptional pathway for transverse patterning. We observed that brassinosteroid application mimicked the auxin response, showing both early and late microtubule array effects, and induced transverse patterning in the <i>axr2-1</i> mutant. Application of auxin to the brassinosteroid synthesis mutant, <i>diminuto1</i>, induced transverse array patterning but did not produce significant axial growth. Thus, exogenous auxin induces transverse microtubule patterning through the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR 1/AUXIN F-BOX (TIR1/AFB) transcriptional pathway and can act independently of brassinosteroids.
