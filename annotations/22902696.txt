In this review, we summarize the evidence pointing at the important role of 26S proteasome-dependent proteolysis in the regulation of microtubule synthesis and microtubule dynamics. Because most of the advances in this relatively unexplored research field originate from yeast and animal studies, we have considered those studies that describe the role of proteolysis in processes that are evolutionarily conserved and known to exist in plants. In addition, we place particular emphasis on the proteasome-dependent degradation of plant-specific microtubule-associated protein SPIRAL1 and its function in MT rearrangements associated with salt stress.
