Drought is one of the main climate threats limiting crop production. Potato is one of the four most important food crop species worldwide and is sensitive to water shortage. The CBP80 gene was shown to affect Arabidopsis and potato responses to drought by regulating the level of microRNA159 and, consequently, the levels of the MYB33 and MYB101 transcription factors (TFs). Here, we show that three MYB TFs, MYB33, MYB65, and MYB101, are involved in plant responses to water shortage. Their downregulation in Arabidopsis causes stomatal hyposensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA), leading to reduced tolerance to drought. Transgenic Arabidopsis and potato plants overexpressing these genes, with a mutated recognition site in miR159, show hypersensitivity to ABA and relatively high tolerance to drought conditions. Thus, the MYB33, MYB65, and MYB101 genes may be potential targets for innovative breeding to obtain crops with relatively high tolerance to drought.
