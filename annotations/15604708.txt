['15604708', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana homeodomain leucine-zipper gene ATHB7 , which is active  specifically under water deficit conditions, is proposed to act as a negative  regulator of growth (Soderman et al ., 1996, Plant J. 10: 375 381; Hjellstrom et  al ., 2003, Plant Cell Environ 26: 1127 1136). In this report we demonstrate that  the paralogous gene, ATHB12 , has a similar expression pattern and function.  ATHB12 ,like ATHB7 ,was up-regulated during water deficit conditions, the  up-regulation being dependent on abscisic acid (ABA) and on the activity of the  Ser/Thr phosphatases ABI1 and ABI2. Plants that are mutant for ATHB12 , as a  result of T-DNA insertions in the ATHB12 gene, showed a reduced sensitivity to  ABA in root elongation assays, whereas transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing  ATHB12 and/or ATHB7 as driven by the CaMV 35S promoter were hypersensitive in  this response compared to wild-type. High-level expression of either gene also  resulted in a delay in inflorescence stem elongation growth and caused plants to  develop rosette leaves with a more rounded shape, shorter petioles, and increased  branching of the inflorescence stem. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the  reporter gene uidA under the control of the ATHB12 promoter showed marker gene  activity in axillary shoot primordia, lateral root primordia, inflorescence stems  and in flower organs. Treatment of plants with ABA or water deficit conditions  caused the activity of ATHB12 to increase in the inflorescence stem, the flower  organs and the leaves, and to expand into the vasculature of roots and the  differentiation/elongation zone of root tips. Taken together, these results  indicate that ATHB12 and ATHB7 act to mediate a growth response to water deficit  by similar mechanisms.', '2004 Jul', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-004-1581-4', 'Soderman']
