Fusarium circinatum poses a threat to both commercial and natural pine forests. Large variation in host resistance exists between species, with many economically important species being susceptible. Development of resistant genotypes could be expedited and optimised by investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying host resistance and susceptibility as well as increasing the available genetic resources. RNA-seq data, from F. circinatum inoculated and mock-inoculated ca. 6-month-old shoot tissue at 3- and 7-days postinoculation, was generated for three commercially important tropical pines, Pinus oocarpa, Pinus maximinoi and Pinus greggii. De novo transcriptomes were assembled and used to investigate the NLR and PR gene content within available pine references. Host responses to F. circinatum challenge were investigated in P. oocarpa (resistant) and P. greggii (susceptible), in comparison to previously generated expression profiles from Pinus tecunumanii (resistant) and Pinus patula (susceptible). Expression results indicated crosstalk between induced salicylate, jasmonate and ethylene signalling is involved in host resistance and compromised in susceptible hosts. Additionally, higher constitutive expression of sulfur metabolism and flavonoid biosynthesis in resistant hosts suggest involvement of these metabolites in resistance.
