In plants, cell signaling connects the environmental input to the intracellular responses in plants. Exogenous signals play an important role in cell metabolism leading to growth and defense responses. Some of these stimuli induce anatomical and physiological modifications that are generally modulated by gene expression. SERK belongs to a small family of genes that code for a transmembrane protein involved in signal transduction and that have been strongly associated with somatic embryogenesis and apomixis in a number of plant species. Recent studies corroborate its role in somatic embryogenesis and suggest a broader range of functions in plant response to biotic and abiotic stimuli. This mini-review aims to present new data on SERK and discuss its involvement in plant development as well as in response to environmental stress.
