AtERF#111/ABR1 belongs to the group X of the ERF/AP2 transcription factor family (GXERFs) and is shoot specifically induced under submergence and hypoxia. It was described to be an ABA-response repressor, but our data reveal a completely different function. Surprisingly, AtERF#111 expression is strongly responsive to wounding stress. Expression profiling of ERF#111-overexpressing (OE) plants, which show morphological phenotypes like increased root hair length and number, strengthens the hypothesis of AtERF#111 being involved in the wounding response, thereby acting as a transcriptional activator of gene expression. Consistent with a potential function outside of oxygen signalling, we could not assign AtERF#111 as a target of the PRT6 N-degron pathway, even though it starts with a highly conserved N-terminal Met-Cys (MC) motif. However, the protein is unstable as it is degraded in an ubiquitin-dependent manner. Finally, direct target genes of AtERF#111 were identified by microarray analyses and subsequently confirmed by protoplast transactivation assays. The special roles of diverse members of the plant-specific GXERFs in coordinating stress signalling and wound repair mechanisms have been recently hypothesized, and our data suggest that AtERF#111 is indeed involved in these processes.
