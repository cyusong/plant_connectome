['19966073', 'The MRS2/MGT gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana belongs to the superfamily of  CorA-MRS2-ALR-type membrane proteins. Proteins of this type are characterized by  a GMN tripeptide motif (Gly-Met-Asn) at the end of the first of two C-terminal  transmembrane domains and have been characterized as magnesium transporters.  Using the recently established mag-fura-2 system allowing direct measurement of  Mg(2+) uptake into mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find that all  members of the Arabidopsis family complement the corresponding yeast mrs2 mutant.  Highly different patterns of tissue-specific expression were observed for the  MRS2/MGT family members in planta. Six of them are expressed in root tissues,  indicating a possible involvement in plant magnesium supply and distribution  after uptake from the soil substrate. Homozygous T-DNA insertion knockout lines  were obtained for four members of the MRS2/MGT gene family. A strong,  magnesium-dependent phenotype of growth retardation was found for mrs2-7 when  Mg(2+) concentrations were lowered to 50 microM in hydroponic cultures. Ectopic  overexpression of MRS2-7 from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter results  in complementation and increased biomass accumulation. Green fluorescent protein  reporter gene fusions indicate a location of MRS2-7 in the endomembrane system.  Hence, contrary to what is frequently found in analyses of plant gene families, a  single gene family member knockout results in a strong, environmentally dependent  phenotype.', '2009 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.070557', 'Knoop']
