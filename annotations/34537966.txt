Soil salinity is one of the major threats that pose challenges to global cereal productivity and food security. Cereals have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to circumvent stress at morpho-physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels. Salt stress cues are perceived by the roots, which trigger the underlying signaling pathways that involve phytohormones. Each phytohormone triggers a specific signaling pathway integrated in a complex manner to produce antagonistic, synergistic, and additive responses. Phytohormones induce salt-responsive signaling pathways to modulate various physiological and anatomical mechanisms, including cell wall repair, apoplastic pH regulation, ion homeostasis, root hair formation, chlorophyll content, and leaf morphology. Exogenous applications of phytohormones moderate the adverse effects of salinity and improve growth. Understanding the complex hormonal crosstalk in cereals under salt stress will advance the knowledge about cooperation or antagonistic mechanisms among hormones and their role in developing salt-tolerant cereals to enhance the productivity of saline agricultural land. In this context, the present review focuses on the mechanisms of hormonal crosstalk that mediate the salt stress response and adaptation in graminaceous crops.
