Wheat rust diseases are widespread and affect all wheat growing areas around the globe. Breeding strategies focus on incorporating genetic disease resistance. However, pathogens can quickly evolve and overcome the resistance genes deployed in commercial cultivars, creating a constant need for identifying new sources of resistance. We have assembled a diverse tetraploid wheat panel comprised of 447 accessions of three Triticum turgidum subspecies and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for resistance to wheat stem, stripe, and leaf rusts. The panel was genotyped with the 90K Wheat iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and subsequent filtering resulted in a set of 6,410 non-redundant SNP markers with known physical positions. Population structure and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the diversity panel could be divided into three subpopulations based on phylogenetic/geographic relatedness. Marker-trait associations (MTAs) were detected for two stem rust, two stripe rust and one leaf rust resistance loci. Of them, three MTAs coincide with the known rust resistance genes Sr13, Yr15 and Yr67, while the other two may harbor undescribed resistance genes. The tetraploid wheat diversity panel, developed and characterized herein, captures wide geographic origins, genetic diversity, and evolutionary history since domestication making it a useful community resource for mapping of other agronomically important traits and for conducting evolutionary studies.
