Over the last decades, most information on the mechanisms underlying tolerance to drought has been gained by considering this stress as a single event that happens just once in the life of a plant, in contrast to what occurs under natural conditions where recurrent drought episodes are the rule. Here we explored mechanisms of drought tolerance in coffee (Coffea canephora) plants from a broader perspective, integrating key aspects of plant physiology and biochemistry. We show that plants exposed to multiple drought events displayed higher photosynthetic rates, which were largely accounted for by biochemical rather than diffusive or hydraulic factors, than those submitted to drought for the first time. Indeed, these plants displayed higher activities of RuBisCO and other enzymes associated with carbon and antioxidant metabolism. Acclimation to multiple drought events involved the expression of trainable genes related to drought tolerance and was also associated with a deep metabolite reprogramming with concordant alterations in central metabolic processes such as respiration and photorespiration. Our results demonstrate that plants exposed to multiple drought cycles can develop a differential acclimation that potentiates their defence mechanisms, allowing them to be kept in an 'alert state' to successfully cope with further drought events.
