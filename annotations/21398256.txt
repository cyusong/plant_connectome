['21398256', 'A number of APETALA2 (AP2)/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) genes have been shown  to function in abiotic and biotic stress responses, and these genes are often  induced by multiple stresses. We report here the characterization of an AP2/ERF  gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that is specifically induced during  hypoxia. We show that under normoxic conditions, the expression of AtERF73/HRE1  can be induced by exogenous addition of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and  that a combination of hypoxia and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid results  in hyperinduction of AtERF73/HRE1 expression. In addition, hypoxic induction of  AtERF73/HRE1 is reduced but not completely abolished in ethylene-insensitive  mutants and in the presence of inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and responses.  These results suggest that, in addition to ethylene, an ethylene-independent  signal is also required to mediate hypoxic induction of AtERF73/HRE1. To assess  the role of AtERF73/HRE1, we generated three independent RNA interference (RNAi)  knockdown lines of AtERF73/HRE1. Under normoxic conditions, the AtERF73/HRE1-RNAi  seedlings displayed increased ethylene sensitivity and exaggerated triple  responses, indicating that AtERF73/HRE1 might play a negative regulatory role in  modulating ethylene responses. Gas chromatography analyses showed that the  production of ethylene was similar between wild-type and RNAi lines under  hypoxia. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses  showed that hypoxia-inducible genes could be affected by AtERF73/HRE1-RNAi lines  in two different ways: hypoxic induction of glycolytic and fermentative genes was  reduced, whereas induction of a number of peroxidase and cytochrome P450 genes  was increased. Taken together, our results show that AtERF73/HRE1 is involved in  modulating ethylene responses under both normoxia and hypoxia.', '2011 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.172486', 'Shih']
