Membrane voltage arises from the transport of ions through ion-translocating ATPases, ion-coupled transport of solutes, and ion channels, and is an integral part of the bioenergetic "currency" of the membrane. The dynamics of membrane voltage-so-called action, systemic, and variation potentials-have also led to a recognition of their contributions to signal transduction, both within cells and across tissues. Here, we review the origins of our understanding of membrane voltage and its place as a central element in regulating transport and signal transmission. We stress the importance of understanding voltage as a common intermediate that acts both as a driving force for transport-an electrical "substrate"-and as a product of charge flux across the membrane, thereby interconnecting all charge-carrying transport across the membrane. The voltage interconnection is vital to signaling via second messengers that rely on ion flux, including cytosolic free Ca2+, H+, and the synthesis of reactive oxygen species generated by integral membrane, respiratory burst oxidases. These characteristics inform on the ways in which long-distance voltage signals and voltage oscillations give rise to unique gene expression patterns and influence physiological, developmental, and adaptive responses such as systemic acquired resistance to pathogens and to insect herbivory.
