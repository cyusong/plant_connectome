Nitrate reallocation to plant roots occurs frequently under adverse conditions and was recently characterized to be actively regulated by Nitrate Transporter1.8 (NRT1.8) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and implicated as a common response to stresses. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely to be determined. In this study, characterization of NRT1.5, a xylem nitrate-loading transporter, showed that the mRNA level of NRT1.5 is down-regulated by salt, drought, and cadmium treatments. Functional disruption of NRT1.5 enhanced tolerance to salt, drought, and cadmium stresses. Further analyses showed that nitrate, as well as Na(+) and Cd(2+) levels, were significantly increased in nrt1.5 roots. Important genes including Na(+)/H(+) exchanger1, Salt overly sensitive1, Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase1, Responsive to desiccation29A, Phytochelatin synthase1, and NRT1.8 in stress response pathways are steadily up-regulated in nrt1.5 mutant plants. Interestingly, altered accumulation of metabolites, including proline and malondialdehyde, was also observed in nrt1.5 plants. These data suggest that NRT1.5 is involved in nitrate allocation to roots and the consequent tolerance to several stresses, in a mechanism probably shared with NRT1.8.
