Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play key roles in regulating various physiological aspects in plant growth and development. In Arabidopsis thaliana, there are at least 223 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) RLKs. The functions of the majority of RLKs in the LRR XI subfamily were previously revealed. Only three RLKs were not characterized. Here we report that two independent triple mutants of these RLKs, named ROOT ELONGATION RECEPTOR KINASES (REKs), exhibit increased cell numbers in the root apical meristem and enhanced cell size in the elongation and maturation zones. The promoter activities of a number of Quiescent Center marker genes are significantly up-regulated in the triple mutant. However, the promoter activities of several marker genes known to control root stem cell niche activities are not altered. RNA-seq analysis revealed that a number of cell wall remodeling genes are significantly up-regulated in the triple mutant. Our results suggest that these REKs play key roles in regulating root development likely via negatively regulating the expression of a number of key cell wall remodeling genes.
