Mycovirus-infected fungi can suffer from poor growth, attenuated pigmentation, and virulence. However, the molecular mechanisms of how mycoviruses confer these symptoms remain poorly understood. Here, we report a mycovirus Stemphylium lycopersici alternavirus 1 (SlAV1) isolated from a necrotrophic plant pathogen <i>Stemphylium lycopersici</i> that causes altered colony pigmentation and hypovirulence by specifically interfering host biosynthesis of Altersolanol A, a polyketide phytotoxin. SlAV1 significantly down-regulates a fungal polyketide synthase (<i>PKS1</i>), the core enzyme of Altersolanol A biosynthesis. <i>PKS1</i> deletion mutants do not accumulate Altersolanol A and lose pathogenicity to tomato and lettuce. Transgenic expression of SlAV1 open-reading frame 3 (ORF3) in <i>S. lycopersici</i> inhibits fungal <i>PKS1</i> expression and Altersolanol A accumulation, leading to symptoms like SlAV1-infected fungal strains. Multiple plant species sprayed with mycelial suspension of <i>S. lycopersici</i> or <i>S. vesicarium</i> strains integrating and expressing ORF3 display enhanced resistance against virulent strains, converting the pathogenic fungi into biocontrol agents. Hence, our study not only proves inhibiting a key enzyme of host phytotoxin biosynthesis as a molecular mechanism underlying SlAV1-mediated hypovirulence of <i>Stemphylium</i> spp., but also demonstrates the potential of mycovirus-gene integrated fungi as a potential biocontrol agent to protect plants from fungal diseases.
