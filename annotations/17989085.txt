Cuticle, including wax and cutin, is the barrier covering plant aerial organs and protecting the inner tissues. The Arabidopsis thaliana ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter CER5 (AtWBC12) has been identified as a wax exporter. In agreement with the latest report of another wax exporter, AtWBC11, here we show that atwbc11 mutants displayed organ fusions and stunted growth, and became vulnerable to chlorophyll leaching and toluidine blue staining. Chemical analysis showed that wax and cutin monomers were both reduced in the atwbc11 mutant. AtWBC11 was widely expressed in aerial organs. Interestingly, we found that the expression was light dependent, and the phytohormone ABA up-regulated AtWBC11 expression. We also found that while the AtWBC11 promoter had a broad pattern of activity, the expression was converted to epidermis specific when the reporter gene was fused to AtWBC11 cDNA. Furthermore, RNA blot analysis supported epidermis-specific expression of AtWBC11. Our results support that AtWBC11 is involved in cuticle development.
