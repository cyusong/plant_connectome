Light drives photosynthesis and informs plants about their surroundings. Regarded as a multifunctional signaling molecule in plants, nitric oxide (NO) has been repeatedly demonstrated to interact with light signaling cascades to control plant growth, development and metabolism. During early plant development, light-triggered NO accumulation counteracts negative regulators of photomorphogenesis and modulates the abundance of, and sensitivity to, plant hormones to promote seed germination and de-etiolation. In photosynthetically active tissues, NO is generated at distinct rates under light or dark conditions and acts at multiple target sites within chloroplasts to regulate photosynthetic reactions. Moreover, changes in NO concentrations in response to light stress promote plant defenses against oxidative stress under high light or ultraviolet-B radiation. Here we review the literature on the interaction of NO with the complicated light and hormonal signaling cascades controlling plant photomorphogenesis and light stress responses, focusing on the recently identified molecular partners and action mechanisms of NO in these events. We also discuss the versatile role of NO in regulating both photosynthesis and light-dependent stomatal movements, two key determinants of plant carbon gain. The regulation of nitrate reductase (NR) by light is highlighted as vital to adjust NO production in plants living under natural light conditions.
