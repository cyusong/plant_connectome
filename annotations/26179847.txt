In eukaryotes alternative splicing (AS) influences transcriptome and proteome diversity. The mechanism and the genetic components mediating AS during plant-virus interactions are not known. Using RNA sequencing approaches, we recently analyzed the global AS changes occurring in Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) during infections of Panicum mosaic virus (PMV) and its satellite virus (SPMV). We reported AS of defense-related genes including receptor-like kinases, NB-LRR proteins and transcription factors. Strikingly, multiple spliceosome components are themselves alternatively spliced during PMV and SPMV infections. Here, we analyzed the temporal splicing patterns of a splicing factor, Bd-SCL33, following infection of Brachypodium with 6 additional viruses in diverse genera. Our results reveal both dynamic and conserved expression patterns of Bd-SCL33 splice variants during virus infection, and implicate Bd-SCL33 function in response to biotic stresses.
