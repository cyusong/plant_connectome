A process of plant recovery after drought cessation is a complex trait which has not been fully recognized. The most important organ associated with this phenomenon in monocots, including forage grasses, is the crown tissue located between shoots and roots. The crown tissue is a meristematic crossroads for metabolites and other compounds between these two plant organs. Here, for the first time, we present a metabolomic and lipidomic study focused on the crown tissue under drought and recovery in forage grasses, important for agriculture in European temperate regions. The plant materials involve high (HDT) and low drought-tolerant (LDT) genotypes of Festuca arundinacea, and Lolium multiflorum/F. arundinacea introgression forms. The obtained results clearly demonstrated that remodeling patterns of the primary metabolome and lipidome in the crown under drought and recovery were different between HDT and LDT plants. Furthermore, HDT plants accumulated higher contents of primary metabolites under drought in the crown tissue, especially carbohydrates which could function as osmoprotectants and storage materials. On the other hand, LDT plants characterized by higher membranes damage under drought, simultaneously accumulated membrane phospholipids in the crown and possessed the capacity to recover their metabolic functions after stress cessation to the levels observed in HDT plants.
