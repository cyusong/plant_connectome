Drought and salinity have become major environmental problems that affect the production of agriculture, forestry and horticulture. The identification of stress-tolerant genes from plants adaptive to harsh environments might be a feasible strategy for plant genetic improvement to address the challenges brought by global climate changes. In this study, a dehydration-upregulated gene <i>MfWRKY7</i> of resurrection Plant <i>Myrothamnus</i><i>f</i><i>labellifolia</i>, encoding a group IId WRKY transcription factor, was cloned and characterized. The overexpression of <i>MfWRKY7</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> increased root length and tolerance to drought and NaCl at both seedling and adult stages. Further investigation indicated that <i>MfWRKY7</i> transgenic plants had higher contents of chlorophyll, proline, soluble protein, and soluble sugar but a lower water loss rate and malondialdehyde content compared with wild-type plants under both drought and salinity stresses. Moreover, the higher activities of antioxidant enzymes and lower accumulation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <i>MfWRKY7</i> transgenic plants were also found, indicating enhanced antioxidation capacity by MfWRKY7. These findings showed that MfWRKY7 may function in positive regulation of responses to drought and salinity stresses, and therefore, it has potential application value in genetic improvement of plant tolerance to abiotic stress.
