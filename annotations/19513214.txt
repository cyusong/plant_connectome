In plant/parasitic plant interaction, little is known about the host plant response before the establishment of the parasite within the host. In the present work, we focused on host responses to parasitic plant, O. ramosa in the early stage of infection. We used a co-culture system of A. thaliana suspension cells and O. ramosa germinated-seeds to avoid parasite attachment. We showed that O. ramosa induced H(2)O(2) generation and camalexin synthesis by A. thaliana followed by a drastic increase in cell death. We further demonstrated that a heat sensitive diffusible signal is responsible for this cell death. These data indicate that recognition of O. ramosa occurs before the attachment of the parasite and initiates plant defence responses.

O. ramosa: !induces! camalexin synthesis 
H(2)O(2): !leads to! cell death 
Heat sensitive signal: !triggers! cell death
