Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play important roles in multiple aspects of plant growth and development. As a member of the TNFR-like RLK subfamily, rice Crinkly4 (OsCR4) functions mainly in epidermal cell differentiation in many organs. Here we show that in addition to its essential role in epidermal cell differentiation in the palea and lemma, OsCR4 positively regulates rice culm elongation, similar to maize CR4. Although OsCR4 is an active kinase, like CR4 in maize and ACR4 in Arabidopsis, the conserved amino acid K532 in OsCR4 is not essential for its kinase activity in vitro. Whether other conserved amino acids are required for its kinase activity and the relationship between its activity and function in plant development remain to be investigated.
