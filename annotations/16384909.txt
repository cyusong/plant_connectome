['16384909', 'Root elongation and root hair formation are important in nutrient absorption. We  found that two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) phospholipase Ds (PLDs),  PLDzeta1 and PLDzeta2, were involved in root elongation during phosphate  limitation. PLDzeta1 and PLDzeta2 are structurally different from the majority of  plant PLDs by having phox and pleckstrin homology domains. Both PLDzetas were  expressed more in roots than in other tissues. It was reported previously that  inducible suppression or inducible overexpression of PLDzeta1 affected root hair  patterning. However, gene knockouts of PLDzeta1, PLDzeta2, or the double knockout  of PLDzeta1 and PLDzeta2 showed no effect on root hair formation. The expression  of PLDzetas increased in response to phosphate limitation. The elongation of  primary roots in PLDzeta1 and PLDzeta2 double knockout mutants was slower than  that of wild type and single knockout mutants. The loss of PLDzeta2, but not  PLDzeta1, led to a decreased accumulation of phosphatidic acid in roots under  phosphate-limited conditions. These results indicate that PLDzeta1 and PLDzeta2  play a role in regulating root development in response to nutrient limitation.', '2006 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.070995', 'Wang']
