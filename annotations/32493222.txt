Heterosis is biologically important but the molecular basis of the phenomenon is poorly understood. We characterized intergeneric hybrids between B. rapa cv. Chiifu and R. sativus cv. WK10039 as an extreme example of heterosis. Taking advantage of clear heterosis phenotypes and the genetic distance between parents, we performed transcriptome and metabolite analysis to decipher the molecular basis of heterosis. The heterosis was expressed as fresh weight in the field and as inflorescence stem length in the glass house. Flowering time, distributed as a normal segregating population, ranged from the early flowering of one parent to the late flowering of the other, in contrast to the homogeneous flowering time in a typical F1 population, indicating unstable allelic interactions. The transcriptome and metabolome both indicated that sugar metabolism was altered, suggesting that the change in metabolism was linked to the heterosis. Because alleles were not shared between the hybridized genomes, classic models only partly explain this heterosis, indicating that other mechanisms are involved. The differential expression of genes for primary and secondary metabolism, along with the altered metabolite profiles, suggests that heterosis could involve a change in balance between primary and secondary metabolism.
