Plant 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (2-CysPRXs) are abundant plastidial thiol-peroxidases involved in key signaling processes such as photosynthesis deactivation at night. Their functions rely on the redox status of their two cysteines and on the enzyme quaternary structure, knowledge of which remains poor in plant cells. Using ex vivo and biochemical approaches, we thoroughly characterized the 2-CysPRX dimer/monomer distribution, hyperoxidation level, and thiol content in Arabidopsis, barley, and potato in relation to the light cycle. Our data reveal that the enzyme hyperoxidization level and its distribution as a dimer and monomer vary through the light cycle in a species-dependent manner. A differential susceptibility to hyperoxidation was observed for the two Arabidopsis 2-CysPRX isoforms and among the proteins of the three species, and was associated to sequence variation in hyperoxidation resistance motifs. Alkylation experiments indicate that only a minor fraction of the 2-CysPRX pool carries one free thiol in the three species, and that this content does not change during the light period. We conclude that most plastidial 2-CysPRX forms are oxidized and propose that there is a species-dependent variability in their functions since dimer and hyperoxidized forms fulfill distinct roles regarding direct oxidation of partners and signal transmission.
