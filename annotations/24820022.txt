In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), ethylene responses are mediated by a family of five receptors that have both overlapping and nonoverlapping roles. In this study, we used loss-of-function mutants for each receptor isoform to determine the role of individual isoforms in seed germination under salt stress. From this analysis, we found subfunctionalization of the receptors in the control of seed germination during salt stress. Specifically, loss of ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 (ETR1) or ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE4 (EIN4) leads to accelerated germination, loss of ETR2 delays germination, and loss of either ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1 (ERS1) or ERS2 has no measurable effect on germination. Epistasis analysis indicates that ETR1 and EIN4 function additively with ETR2 to control this trait. Interestingly, regulation of germination by ETR1 requires the full-length receptor. The differences in germination between etr1 and etr2 loss-of-function mutants under salt stress could not be explained by differences in the production of or sensitivity to ethylene, gibberellin, or cytokinin. Instead, etr1 loss-of-function mutants have reduced sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and germinate earlier than the wild type, whereas etr2 loss-of-function mutants have increased sensitivity to ABA and germinate slower than the wild type. Additionally, the differences in seed germination on salt between the two mutants and the wild type are eliminated by the ABA biosynthetic inhibitor norflurazon. These data suggest that ETR1 and ETR2 have roles independent of ethylene signaling that affect ABA signaling and result in altered germination during salt stress.
