A group of vascular plants called homoiochlorophyllous resurrection plants evolved unique capabilities to protect their photosynthetic machinery against desiccation-induced damage. This study examined whether the ontogenetic status of the resurrection plant Craterostigma pumilum has an impact on how the plant responds to dehydration at the thylakoid membrane level to prepare cells for the desiccated state. Thus, younger plants (<4 months) were compared with their older (>6 months) counterparts. Ultrastructural analysis provided evidence that younger plants suppressed senescence-like programs that are realized in older plants. During dehydration, older plants degrade specific subunits of the photosynthetic apparatus such as the D1 subunit of PSII and subunits of the cytochrome b6f complex. The latter leads to a controlled down-regulation of linear electron transport. In contrast, younger plants increased photoprotective high-energy quenching mechanisms and maintained a high capability to replace damaged D1 subunits. It follows that depending on the ontogenetic state, either more degradation-based or more photoprotective mechanisms are employed during dehydration of Craterostigma pumilum.

Younger plants: !suppress! Senescence-like programs
Older plants: !degrade! D1 subunit of PSII
Older plants: !degrade! Subunits of cytochrome b6f complex
Younger plants: !increase! Photoprotective high-energy quenching mechanisms
Younger plants: !maintain! High capability to replace damaged D1 subunits
