The covalent histone modifications were associated with plant development. However, the function of histone modification factors involved in gibberellins (GAs) signaling pathway remains unclear. In recent study, we reported that histone modification factors MUT9p-LIKE KINASE1 (MLK1) and MLK2 coordinate GA and circadian clock signaling in hypocotyl elongation. MLK1 and MLK2 interact with the DELLA protein REPRESSOR OF ga1-3 (RGA), and antagonize the function of RGA to interact with CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1), resulting in promoting hypocotyl elongation. In this addendum to the report, we presented and discussed the results related to the function of MLK1 and MLK2 in GA pathway. MLK1 and MLK2 interact with RGA, which is independent on 17-amino acid DELLA, TVHYNP, or Poly S/T/V motif, suggesting that MLK1 and MLK2 might have novel functions beyond the protein degradation.
