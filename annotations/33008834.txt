<i>Euglena gracilis</i> is a photosynthetic flagellate possessing chlorophyte-derived secondary plastids that are enclosed by only three enveloping membranes, unlike most secondary plastids, which are surrounded by four membranes. It has generally been assumed that the two innermost <i>E. gracilis</i> plastid envelopes originated from the primary plastid, while the outermost is of eukaryotic origin. It was suggested that nucleus-encoded plastid proteins pass through the middle and innermost plastid envelopes of <i>E. gracilis</i> by machinery homologous to the translocons of outer and inner chloroplast membranes, respectively. Although recent genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data proved the presence of a reduced form of the translocon of inner membrane, they failed to identify any outer-membrane translocon homologs, which raised the question of the origin of <i>E. gracilis</i>'s middle plastid envelope. Here, we compared the lipid composition of whole cells of the pigmented <i>E. gracilis</i> strain <i>Z</i> and two bleached mutants that lack detectable plastid structures, <i>W10BSmL</i> and <i>WgmZOflL</i> We determined the lipid composition of <i>E. gracilis</i> strain <i>Z</i> mitochondria and plastids, and of plastid subfractions (thylakoids and envelopes), using HPLC high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, thin-layer chromatography, and gas chromatography-flame ionization detection analytical techniques. Phosphoglycerolipids are the main structural lipids in mitochondria, while glycosyldiacylglycerols are the major structural lipids of plastids and also predominate in extracts of whole mixotrophic cells. Glycosyldiacylglycerols were detected in both bleached mutants, indicating that mutant cells retain some plastid remnants. Additionally, we discuss the origin of the <i>E. gracilis</i> middle plastid envelope based on the lipid composition of envelope fraction.
