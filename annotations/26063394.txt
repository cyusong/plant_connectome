Peroxisomes are present in almost all plant cells. These organelles are involved in various metabolic processes, such as lipid catabolism and photorespiration. A notable feature of plant peroxisomes is their flexible adaptive responses to environmental conditions such as light. When plants shift from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth during the post-germinative stage, peroxisomes undergo a dynamic response, i.e. enzymes involved in lipid catabolism are replaced with photorespiratory enzymes. Although the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the functional transition of peroxisomes have previously been unclear, recent analyses at the cellular level have enabled this detailed machinery to be characterized. During the functional transition, obsolete enzymes are degraded inside peroxisomes by Lon protease, while newly synthesized enzymes are transported into peroxisomes. In parallel, mature and oxidized peroxisomes are eliminated via autophagy; this functional transition occurs in an efficient manner. Moreover, it has become clear that quality control mechanisms are important for the peroxisomal response to environmental stimuli. In this review, we highlight recent advances in elucidating the molecular mechanisms required for the regulation of peroxisomal roles in response to changes in environmental conditions.
