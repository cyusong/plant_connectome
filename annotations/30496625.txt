Nine phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases C (PLCs) have been identified in the Arabidopsis genome; among the importance of PLC2 in reproductive development is significant. However, the role of PLC2 in vegetative development such as in root growth is elusive. Here, we report that plc2 mutants displayed multiple auxin-defective phenotypes in root development, including short primary root, impaired root gravitropism, and inhibited root hair growth. The DR5:GUS expression and the endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content, as well as the responses of a set of auxin-related genes to exogenous IAA treatment, were all decreased in plc2 seedlings, suggesting the influence of PLC2 on auxin accumulation and signalling. The root elongation of plc2 mutants was less sensitive to the high concentration of exogenous auxins, and the application of 1-naphthaleneacetic acid or the auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid could rescue the root hair growth of plc2 mutants. In addition, the PIN2 polarity and cycling in plc2 root epidermis cells were altered. These results demonstrate a critical role of PLC2 in auxin-mediated root development in Arabidopsis, in which PLC2 influences the polar distribution of PIN2.
