['17376158', 'Anion transporting proteins of the CLC type are involved in anion homeostasis in  a variety of organisms. CLCs from Arabidopsis have been shown to participate in  nitrate accumulation and storage. In this study, the physiological role of the  functional chloride transporter AtCLC-d from Arabidopsis was investigated.  AtCLC-d is weakly expressed in various tissues, including the root. When  transiently expressed as a GFP fusion in protoplasts, it co-localized with the  VHA-a1 subunit of the proton-transporting V-type ATPase in the trans-Golgi  network (TGN). Stable expression in plants showed that it co-localized with the  endocytic tracer dye FM4-64 in a brefeldin A-sensitive compartment. Immunogold  electron microscopy confirmed the localization of AtCLC-d to the TGN. Disruption  of the AtCLC-d gene by a T-DNA insertion did not affect the nitrate and chloride  contents. The overall morphology of these clcd-1 plants was similar to that of  the wild-type, but root growth on synthetic medium was impaired. Moreover, the  sensitivity of hypocotyl elongation to treatment with concanamycin A, a blocker  of the V-ATPase, was stronger in the clcd-1 mutant. These phenotypes could be  complemented by overexpression of AtCLC-d in the mutant background. The results  suggest that the luminal pH in the trans-Golgi network is adjusted by  AtCLC-d-mediated transport of a counter anion such as Cl(-) or NO(3)(-).', '2007 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03061.x', 'Ludewig']
