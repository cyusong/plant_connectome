The key enzyme for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase (PEPC), evolved from nonphotosynthetic PEPC found in C<sub>3</sub> ancestors. In all plants, PEPC is phosphorylated by Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase Protein Kinase (PPCK). However, differences in the phosphorylation pattern exist among plants with these photosynthetic types, and it is still not clear if they are due to interspecies differences or depend on photosynthetic type. The genus Flaveria contains closely related C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate, and C<sub>4</sub> species, which are evolutionarily young and thus well suited for comparative analysis. To characterize the evolutionary differences in PPCK between plants with C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, transcriptome libraries from nine Flaveria spp. were used, and a two-member PPCK family (PPCKA and PPCKB) was identified. Sequence analysis identified a number of C<sub>3</sub>- and C<sub>4</sub>-specific residues with various occurrences in the intermediates. Quantitative analysis of transcriptome data revealed that PPCKA and PPCKB exhibit inverse diel expression patterns and that C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> Flaveria spp. differ in the expression levels of these genes. PPCKA has maximal expression levels during the day, whereas PPCKB has maximal expression during the night. Phosphorylation patterns of PEPC varied among C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> Flaveria spp. too, with PEPC from the C<sub>4</sub> species being predominantly phosphorylated throughout the day, while in the C<sub>3</sub> species the phosphorylation level was maintained during the entire 24 h. Since C<sub>4</sub> Flaveria spp. evolved from C<sub>3</sub> ancestors, this work links the evolutionary changes in sequence, PPCK expression, and phosphorylation pattern to an evolutionary phase shift of kinase activity from a C<sub>3</sub> to a C<sub>4</sub> mode.
