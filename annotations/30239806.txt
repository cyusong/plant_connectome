The family of small auxin up-regulated RNA (SAUR) genes is a family of auxin-responsive genes with ~60-140 members in most higher plant species. Despite the early discovery of their auxin responsiveness, their function and mode of action remained unknown for a long time. In recent years, the importance of SAUR genes in the regulation of dynamic and adaptive growth, and the molecular mechanisms by which SAUR proteins act are increasingly well understood. SAURs play a central role in auxin-induced acid growth, but can also act independently of auxin, tissue specifically regulated by various other hormone pathways and transcription factors. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the characterization of the SAUR genes in Arabidopsis and other plant species. We particularly elaborate on their capacity to fine-tune growth in response to internal and external signals, and discuss the breakthroughs in understanding the mode of action of SAURs in relation to their complex regulation.
