Tropisms, growth responses to environmental stimuli such as light or gravity, are spectacular examples of adaptive plant development. The plant hormone auxin serves as a major coordinative signal. The PIN auxin exporters, through their dynamic polar subcellular localizations, redirect auxin fluxes in response to environmental stimuli and the resulting auxin gradients across organs underlie differential cell elongation and bending. In this review, we discuss recent advances concerning regulations of PIN polarity during tropisms, focusing on PIN phosphorylation and trafficking. We also cover how environmental cues regulate PIN actions during tropisms, as well as the crucial role of auxin feedback on PIN polarity during bending termination. Finally, the interactions between different tropisms are reviewed to understand plant adaptive growth in the natural environment.
