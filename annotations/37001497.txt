Plants are not exactly known to be great conversationalists. In this issue of Cell, a new study highlights that when stressed by desiccation or cutting injury, tomato and tobacco plants can produce airborne ultrasonic emissions. These sounds are loud enough to be heard by insects and can be analytically categorized using trained neural networks, pointing to their potential informative value.
