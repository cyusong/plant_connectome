Humans have cultivated grasses for food, feed, beverages, and construction materials for millennia. Grasses also dominate the landscape in vast parts of the world, where they have adapted morphologically and physiologically, diversifying to form ~12,000 species. Sequences of hundreds of grass genomes show that they are essentially collinear; nonetheless, not all species have the same complement of genes. Here, we focus on the molecular, cellular, and developmental bases of grain yield and dispersal-traits that are essential for domestication. Distinct genes, networks, and pathways were selected in different crop species, reflecting underlying genomic diversity. With increasing genomic resources becoming available in nondomesticated species, we anticipate advances in coming years that illuminate the ecological and economic success of the grasses.
