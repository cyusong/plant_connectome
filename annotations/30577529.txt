['30577529', 'Light signaling pathways interact with the circadian clock to help organisms  synchronize physiological and developmental processes to periodic environmental  cycles. The plant photoreceptors responsible for clock resetting have been  characterized, but signaling components that link the photoreceptors to the clock  remain to be identified. Members of the family of NIGHT LIGHT(-)INDUCIBLE AND  CLOCK-REGULATED (LNK) genes play key roles linking light regulation of gene  expression to the control of daily and seasonal rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana.  Particularly, LNK1 and LNK2 were shown to control circadian rhythms,  photomorphogenic responses, and photoperiod-dependent flowering time. Here we  analyze the role of the four members of the LNK family in Arabidopsis in these  processes. We found that depletion of the closely related LNK3 and LNK4 in a  lnk1;lnk2 mutant background affects circadian rhythms, but not other  clock-regulated processes such as flowering time and seedling photomorphogenesis.  Nevertheless, plants defective in all LNK genes (lnkQ quadruple mutants) display  developmental alterations that lead to increased rosette size, biomass, and  enhanced phototropic responses. Our work indicates that members of the LNK family  have both distinctive and partially overlapping functions, and are an essential  link to orchestrate light-regulated developmental processes.', '2018 Dec 20', 'Genes (Basel)', '10.3390/genes10010002', 'Yanovsky']
