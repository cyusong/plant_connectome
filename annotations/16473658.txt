The role of beta-glucosidase during the phototropic response in maize (Zea mays) coleoptiles was investigated. Unilateral blue light illumination abruptly up-regulated the activity of beta-glucosidase in the illuminated halves, 10 min after the onset of illumination, peaking after 30 min and decreasing thereafter. The level of 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA), which is released from DIMBOA glucoside (DIMBOA-Glc) by beta-glucosidase, and its degradation compound 6-methoxy-benzoxazolinone (MBOA) were elevated within 30 min in the illuminated halves as compare to the shaded halves, prior to the phototropic curvature. Furthermore, beta-glucosidase inhibitor treatment significantly decreased the phototropic curvature and decreased growth suppression in the illuminated sides. These results suggest that blue light induces the activity of beta-glucosidase in the illuminated halves of coleoptiles causing an increase in DIMBOA biosynthesis and the growth inhibition that leads to a phototropic curvature.
