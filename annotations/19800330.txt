Plant Golgi bodies possess unique morphological and functional characteristics that are key to several biological and biotechnological processes, such as transport of the cell's building blocks to energy-rich compartments, including chloroplasts, storage vacuoles and a cellulosic cell wall. During the last decade it has become apparent that the plant Golgi apparatus has features that are remarkably different from other systems. Here we summarize the most recent findings on this organelle and we highlight pressing questions that are likely to drive the next 10 years of research on the plant Golgi apparatus.
