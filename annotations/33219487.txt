The recent preparations of metal nanoparticles using plant extracts as reducing agents are summarized here. The synthesis and characterization of plant-metal nanomaterials and the progress in antibacterial and anti-inflammatory medical applications are detailed, providing a new vision for plant-based medical applications. The medical application of plant-metal nanoparticles is becoming a research hotspot. Compared with traditional preparation methods, the synthesis of plant-metal nanoparticles is less toxic and more eco-friendly, increasing application potential. Highly efficient plant-metal nanoparticles are usually smaller than 100 nm. This review describes the synthesis, characterization and bioactivities of gold- and silver-plant nanoparticles as examples and clearly explained their antibacterial and anticancer mechanisms. An analysis of actual cases shows that the synthetic method and type of plant extract affect the activities of the products.
