Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for humans, animals, and plants, and it participates in various morphological, physiological, and biochemical processes. Cu is a cofactor for a variety of enzymes, and it plays an important role in photosynthesis, respiration, the antioxidant system, and signal transduction. Many studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of excess Cu on crop germination, growth, photosynthesis, and antioxidant activity. This review summarizes the biological functions of Cu, the toxicity of excess Cu to plant growth and development, the roles of Cu transport proteins and chaperone proteins, and the transport process of Cu in plants, as well as the mechanisms of detoxification and tolerance of Cu in plants. Future research directions are proposed, which provide guidelines for related research.
