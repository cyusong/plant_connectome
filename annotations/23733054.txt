Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses of the experimental pathosystem constituted by Ustilago maydis and Arabidopsis thaliana were performed. Haploid or diploid strains of U. maydis inoculated in A. thaliana plantlets grew on the surface and within the plant tissues in the form of mycelium, inducing chlorosis, anthocyanin formation, malformations, necrosis and adventitious roots development, but not teliospores. Symptoms were more severe in plants inoculated with the haploid strain which grew more vigorously than the diploid strain. RNA extracted at different times post-infection was used for hybridization of one-channel microarrays that were analyzed focusing on the fungal genes involved in the general pathogenic process, biogenesis of the fungal cell wall and the secretome. In total, 3,537 and 3,299 genes were differentially expressed in the haploid and diploid strains, respectively. Differentially expressed genes were related to different functional categories and many of them showed a similar regulation occurring in U. maydis infecting maize. Our data suggest that the haploid strain behaves as a necrotrophic pathogen, whereas the diploid behaves as a biotrophic pathogen. The results obtained are evidence of the usefulness of the U. maydis-A. thaliana pathosystem for the analysis of the pathogenic mechanisms of U. maydis.
