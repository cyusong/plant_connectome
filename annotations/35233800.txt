Carbonic anhydrase (CA) performs the first enzymatic step of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis by catalysing the reversible hydration of dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> that diffuses into mesophyll cells from intercellular airspaces. This CA-catalysed reaction provides the bicarbonate used by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase to generate products that flow into the C<sub>4</sub> carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM). It was previously demonstrated that the Zea mays ca1ca2 double mutant lost 97% of leaf CA activity, but there was little difference in the growth phenotype under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressures (pCO<sub>2</sub> ). We hypothesise that since CAs are among the fastest enzymes, minimal activity from a third CA, CA8, can provide the inorganic carbon needed to drive C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We observed that removing CA8 from the maize ca1ca2 background resulted in plants that had 0.2% of wild-type leaf CA activity. These ca1ca2ca8 plants had reduced photosynthetic parameters and could only survive at elevated pCO<sub>2</sub> . Photosynthetic and carbon isotope analysis combined with modelling of photosynthesis and carbon isotope discrimination was used to determine if ca1ca2ca8 plants had a functional C<sub>4</sub> cycle or were relying on direct CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase within bundle sheath cells. The results suggest that leaf CA activity in ca1ca2ca8 plants was not sufficient to sustain the C<sub>4</sub> CCM.

Carbonic anhydrase: !catalyses! CO2 hydration 
CA1/CA2: !lack! 97% of leaf CA activity 
CA8: !supplements! minimal activity 
ca1ca2ca8 plants: !have! 0.2% of wild-type leaf CA activity 
ca1ca2ca8 plants: !rely on! direct CO2 diffusion 
C4 cycle: !not sustained! by ca1ca2ca8 plants
