For land plants, water is the principal governor of growth. Photosynthetic performance is highly dependent on the stable and suitable water status of leaves, which is balanced by the water transport capacity, the water loss rate as well as the water capacitance of the plant. This review discusses the links between leaf water status and photosynthesis, specifically focussing on the coordination of CO<sub>2</sub> and water transport within leaves, and the potential role of leaf capacitance and elasticity on CO<sub>2</sub> and water transport.
