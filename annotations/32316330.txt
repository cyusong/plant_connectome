Plants are able to synthesize all essential metabolites from minerals, water, and light to complete their life cycle. This plasticity comes at a high energy cost, and therefore, plants need to tightly allocate resources in order to control their economy. Being sessile, plants can only adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions, relying on quality control mechanisms. The remodeling of cellular components plays a crucial role, not only in response to stress, but also in normal plant development. Dynamic protein turnover is ensured through regulated protein synthesis and degradation processes. To effectively target a wide range of proteins for degradation, plants utilize two mechanistically-distinct, but largely complementary systems: the 26S proteasome and the autophagy. As both proteasomal- and autophagy-mediated protein degradation use ubiquitin as an essential signal of substrate recognition, they share ubiquitin conjugation machinery and downstream ubiquitin recognition modules. Recent progress has been made in understanding the cellular homeostasis of iron and sulfur metabolisms individually, and growing evidence indicates that complex crosstalk exists between iron and sulfur networks. In this review, we highlight the latest publications elucidating the role of selective protein degradation in the control of iron and sulfur metabolism during plant development, as well as environmental stresses.
