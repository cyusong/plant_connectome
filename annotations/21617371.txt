Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; SER) is one of the well-studied indoleamine neurotransmitter in vertebrates. Recently SER has also been reported in wide range of plant species. The precise function of SER at the physiological level, particularly growth regulation, flowering, xylem sap exudation, ion permeability and plant morphogenesis in plant system has not been clear. Though SER is found in different parts of plant species including leaves, stems, roots, fruits and seeds, the quantity of SER within plant tissues varies widely. SER has been recently shown as a plant hormone in view of its auxin-like activity. This brief review provide an overview of SER biosynthesis, localization, its role in plant morphogenesis and possible physiological functions in plants. This would certainly help to elucidate further the multiple roles of SER in plant morphogenesis. In the future it may form the basis for studies on involvement of SER in cellular signaling mechanisms in plants. Apart from these gaps in understanding the role of SER in ontogeny of plant physiology and ecological, adaptations have been emphasized. Thus, overall perspectives in this area of research and its possible implications have been presented.
