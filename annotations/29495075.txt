The large retromer complex participates in diverse endosomal trafficking pathways and is essential for plant developmental programs, including cell polarity, programmed cell death and shoot gravitropism in Arabidopsis. Here we demonstrate that an evolutionarily conserved VPS26 protein (VPS26C; At1G48550) functions in a complex with VPS35A and VPS29 necessary for root hair growth in Arabidopsis. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation showed that VPS26C forms a complex with VPS35A in the presence of VPS29, and this is supported by genetic studies showing that vps29 and vps35a mutants exhibit altered root hair growth. Genetic analysis also demonstrated an interaction between a VPS26C trafficking pathway and one involving the SNARE VTI13. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that VPS26C, with the notable exception of grasses, has been maintained in the genomes of most major plant clades since its evolution at the base of eukaryotes. To test the model that VPS26C orthologs in animal and plant species share a conserved function, we generated transgenic lines expressing GFP fused with the VPS26C human ortholog (HsDSCR3) in a vps26c background. These studies illustrate that GFP-HsDSCR3 is able to complement the vps26c root hair phenotype in Arabidopsis, indicating a deep conservation of cellular function for this large retromer subunit across plant and animal kingdoms.
