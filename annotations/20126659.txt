['20126659', "BACKGROUND: Second messengers have a key role in linking environmental stimuli to  physiological responses. One such messenger, guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate  (cGMP), has long been known to be an essential signaling molecule in many  different physiological processes in higher plants, including biotic stress  responses. To date, however, the guanylyl cyclase (GC) enzymes that catalyze the  formation of cGMP from GTP have largely remained elusive in higher plants.  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have identified an Arabidopsis receptor type wall  associated kinase-like molecule (AtWAKL10) as a candidate GC and provide  experimental evidence to show that the intracellular domain of AtWAKL10(431-700)  can generate cGMP in vitro. Further, we also demonstrate that the molecule has  kinase activity indicating that AtWAKL10 is a twin-domain catalytic protein. A  co-expression and stimulus-specific expression analysis revealed that AtWAKL10 is  consistently co-expressed with well characterized pathogen defense related genes  and along with these genes is induced early and sharply in response to a range of  pathogens and their elicitors. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that AtWAKL10 is a  twin-domain, kinase-GC signaling molecule that may function in biotic stress  responses that are critically dependent on the second messenger cGMP.", '2010 Jan 26', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0008904', 'Gehring']
