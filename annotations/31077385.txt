Fruit and seed crop production heavily relies on successful stigma pollination, pollen tube growth, and fertilization of female gametes. These processes depend on production of viable pollen grains, a process sensitive to high-temperature stress. Therefore, rising global temperatures threaten worldwide crop production. Close observation of plant development shows that high-temperature stress causes morpho-anatomical changes in male reproductive tissues that contribute to reproductive failure. These changes include early tapetum degradation, anther indehiscence, and deformity of pollen grains, all of which are contributing factors to pollen fertility. At the molecular level, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate when plants are subjected to high temperatures. ROS is a signalling molecule that can be beneficial or detrimental for plant cells depending on its balance with the endogenous cellular antioxidant system. Many metabolites have been linked with ROS over the years acting as direct scavengers or molecular stabilizers that promote antioxidant enzyme activity. This review highlights recent advances in research on anther and pollen development and how these might explain the aberrations seen during high-temperature stress; recent work on the role of nitrogen and carbon metabolites in anther and pollen development is discussed including their potential role at high temperature.
