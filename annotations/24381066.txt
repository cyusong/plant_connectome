['24381066', 'Fructose (Fru) is a major storage form of sugars found in vacuoles, yet the  molecular regulation of vacuolar Fru transport is poorly studied. Although  SWEET17 (for SUGARS WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXPORTED TRANSPORTERS17) has been  characterized as a vacuolar Fru exporter in leaves, its expression in leaves is  low. Here, RNA analysis and SWEET17-beta-glucuronidase/-GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN  fusions expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) reveal that SWEET17 is  highly expressed in the cortex of roots and localizes to the tonoplast of root  cells. Expression of SWEET17 in roots was inducible by Fru and darkness,  treatments that activate accumulation and release of vacuolar Fru, respectively.  Mutation and ectopic expression of SWEET17 led to increased and decreased root  growth in the presence of Fru, respectively. Overexpression of SWEET17  specifically reduced the Fru content in leaves by 80% during cold stress. These  results intimate that SWEET17 functions as a Fru-specific uniporter on the root  tonoplast. Vacuoles overexpressing SWEET17 showed increased [14C]Fru uptake  compared with the wild type. SWEET17-mediated Fru uptake was insensitive to ATP  or treatment with NH4Cl or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, indicating  that SWEET17 functions as an energy-independent facilitative carrier. The  Arabidopsis genome contains a close paralog of SWEET17 in clade IV, SWEET16. The  predominant expression of SWEET16 in root vacuoles and reduced root growth of  mutants under Fru excess indicate that SWEET16 also functions as a vacuolar  transporter in roots. We propose that in addition to a role in leaves, SWEET17  plays a key role in facilitating bidirectional Fru transport across the tonoplast  of roots in response to metabolic demand to maintain cytosolic Fru homeostasis.', '2014 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.232751', 'Martinoia']
