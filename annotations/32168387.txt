Microalgae and cyanobacteria contribute roughly half of the global photosynthetic carbon assimilation. Faced with limited access to CO<sub>2</sub> in aquatic environments, which can vary daily or hourly, these microorganisms have evolved use of an efficient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism (CCM) to accumulate high internal concentrations of inorganic carbon (C<sub>i</sub> ) to maintain photosynthetic performance. For eukaryotic algae, a combination of molecular, genetic and physiological studies using the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have revealed the function and molecular characteristics of many CCM components, including active C<sub>i</sub> uptake systems. Fundamental to eukaryotic C<sub>i</sub> uptake systems are C<sub>i</sub> transporters/channels located in membranes of various cell compartments, which together facilitate the movement of C<sub>i</sub> from the environment into the chloroplast, where primary CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation occurs. Two putative plasma membrane C<sub>i</sub> transporters, HLA3 and LCI1, are reportedly involved in active C<sub>i</sub> uptake. Based on previous studies, HLA3 clearly plays a meaningful role in HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport, but the function of LCI1 has not yet been thoroughly investigated so remains somewhat obscure. Here we report a crystal structure of the full-length LCI1 membrane protein to reveal LCI1 structural characteristics, as well as in vivo physiological studies in an LCI1 loss-of-function mutant to reveal the C<sub>i</sub> species preference for LCI1. Together, these new studies demonstrate LCI1 plays an important role in active CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and that LCI1 likely functions as a plasma membrane CO<sub>2</sub> channel, possibly a gated channel.
