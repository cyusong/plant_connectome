['16284776', 'Two class III peroxidases from Arabidopsis, AtPrx33 and Atprx34, have been  studied in this paper. Their encoding genes are mainly expressed in roots;  AtPrx33 transcripts were also found in leaves and stems. Light activates the  expression of both genes in seedlings. Transformed seedlings producing  AtPrx33-GFP or AtPrx34-GFP fusion proteins under the control of the CaMV 35S  promoter exhibit fluorescence in the cell walls of roots, showing that the two  peroxidases are localized in the apoplast, which is in line with their affinity  for the Ca(2+)-pectate structure. The role they can play in cell wall was  investigated using (1) insertion mutants that have suppressed or reduced  expression of AtPrx33 or AtPrx34 genes, respectively, (2) a double mutant with no  AtPrx33 and a reduced level of Atprx34 transcripts, (3) a mutant overexpressing  AtPrx34 under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. The major phenotypic  consequences of these genetic manipulations were observed on the variation of the  length of seedling roots. Seedlings lacking AtPrx33 transcripts have shorter  roots than the wild-type controls and roots are still shorter in the double  mutant. Seedlings overexpressing AtPrx34 exhibit significantly longer roots.  These modifications of root length are accompanied by corresponding changes of  cell length. The results suggest that AtPrx33 and Atprx34, two highly homologous  Arabidopsis peroxidases, are involved in the reactions that promote cell  elongation and that this occurs most likely within cell walls.', '2006 Apr', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-005-0153-4', 'Dunand']
