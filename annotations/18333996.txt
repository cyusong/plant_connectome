Leaf senescence and nitrogen remobilization from senescing tissues are two important factors determining grain protein content (GPC) in cereals. We compared near-isogenic barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) germplasm varying in the allelic state of a major GPC quantitative trait locus on chromosome 6, delineated by molecular markers HVM74 and ABG458 and explaining approximately 46% of the variability in this trait. High GPC was consistently associated with earlier whole-plant senescence. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of flag leaf proteins indicated earlier leaf protein [including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)] degradation in high-GPC germplasm. This was accompanied by enhanced availability of ammonium and glutamine in developing kernels, suggesting increased phloem retranslocation of nitrogen. Based on previous microarray analysis, we performed a detailed expression study of six leaf genes, tentatively involved in plastidial proteolysis, vacuolar proteolysis, intermediary N metabolism and N transport. All of these were upregulated in high-GPC barley, mostly around 21 to 28 days past anthesis, prior to or around the time demonstrating maximal differences in leaf protein (including Rubisco) levels. Therefore, these genes represent potential targets to manipulate grain protein accumulation. It appears likely that their functional analysis will enhance our understanding of whole-plant N recycling. Additionally, earlier leaf (photosynthetic) protein degradation may lead to reduced N carbon assimilation in high-GPC germplasm, explaining past studies demonstrating a negative correlation between GPC and yield.
