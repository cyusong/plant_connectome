Hybrids are the perfect materials to study cis regulatory elements because the two parental alleles are subjected to identical trans environments. There has been a debate on whether synonymous codon usage could affect gene expression. In vitro experiments found that luciferase genes with enhanced codon optimality showed elevated mRNA expression. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear, and no direct evidence is observed to support this notion. By mapping the RNA-seq data of hybrids of Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, we quantified the allele-specific reads and estimated the relative expression of orthologous genes. We focused on orthologous genes with dN = 0 and dS > 0, which means that they only differ in synonymous codon usage. We found that orthologous genes with higher codon optimality in A. thaliana tend to have higher expression levels of the A. thaliana allele. Codon usage bias could influence gene expression. This phenomenon is not only found in in vitro experiments but also supported by in vivo observations. Therefore, synonymous mutations could have a broad impact from multiple aspects and should not be automatically ignored in genomic studies. KEY MESSAGE: In Arabidopsis hybrids, alleles with higher codon optimality tend to have higher expression levels.
