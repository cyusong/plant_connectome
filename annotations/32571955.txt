The Casparian strip (CS) is a tight junction-like structure formed by lignin impregnation on the walls of endodermal cells in plant roots. The CS membrane domain (CSD<sup>M</sup>), demarked by the CASP proteins, is important for orienting lignification enzymes. Here, we report that an endodermis-expressed multicopper oxidase, LACCASE3 (LAC3) in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, locates to the interface between lignin domains and the cell wall during early CS development prior to CASP1 localizing to CSD<sup>M</sup> and eventually flanks the mature CS. Pharmacological perturbation of LAC3 causes dispersed localization of CASP1 and compensatory ectopic lignification. These results support the existence of a LAC3-based CS wall domain which coordinates with CSD<sup>M</sup> to provide bidirectional positional information that guides precise CS lignification.
