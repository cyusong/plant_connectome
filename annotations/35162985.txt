Ammonium is a paradoxical nutrient because it is more metabolically efficient than nitrate, but also causes plant stresses in excess, i.e., ammonium toxicity. Current knowledge indicates that ammonium tolerance is species-specific and related to the ammonium assimilation enzyme activities. However, the mechanisms underlying the ammonium tolerance in bedding plants remain to be elucidated. The study described herein explores the primary traits contributing to the ammonium tolerance in three bedding plants. Three NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>:NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ratios (0:100, 50:50, 100:0) were supplied to salvia, petunia, and ageratum. We determined that they possessed distinct ammonium tolerances: salvia and petunia were, respectively, extremely sensitive and moderately sensitive to high NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations, whereas ageratum was tolerant to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, as characterized by the responses of the shoot and root growth, photosynthetic capacity, and nitrogen (amino acid and soluble protein)-carbohydrate (starch) distributions. An analysis of the major nitrogen assimilation enzymes showed that the root GS (glutamine synthetase) and NADH-GDH (glutamate dehydrogenase) activities in ageratum exhibited a dose-response relationship (reinforced by 25.24% and 6.64%, respectively) as the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> level was raised from 50% to 100%; but both enzyme activities were significantly diminished in salvia. Besides, negligible changes of GS activities monitored in leaves revealed that only the root GS and NADH-GDH underpin the ammonium tolerances of the three bedding plants.
