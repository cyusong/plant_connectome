['31331996', 'DNA methylation and histone modification are important epigenetic marks that  coregulate gene expression and genome stability. To identify factors involved in  chromatin silencing, we carried out a forward genetic screen for mutants that  release the silenced Pro-35S:LUCIFERASE (35SP-LUC) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana). We identified an epigenetic regulator, METHIONINE SYNTHASE1 (ATMS1),  which catalyzes the synthesis of methionine (Met) in the one-carbon metabolism  pathway. The ATMS1 mutation releases the silenced 35SP-LUC and the majority of  endogenous genes and transposons. The effect of ATMS1 on chromatin silencing is  related to decreased levels of DNA methylation (CG, CHG, and CHH) and histone-3  lysine-9 dimethylation. The ATMS1 mutation caused a significant decrease in the  ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine. Exogenous application of  Met rescued the phenotype of atms1-1 ATMS1 plays a predominant role in DNA and  histone methylations among the three Met synthetase homologs. These results  suggest that ATMS1 is required for DNA and histone methylations through its  function in the one-carbon metabolism pathway, indicating the complex interplay  between metabolism and epigenetic regulation.', '2019 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.19.00528', 'ORCID:']
