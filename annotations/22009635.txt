Large numbers of noncoding RNA transcripts (ncRNAs) are being revealed in animals and plants, which can function at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level to negatively regulate or control genes, repetitive sequences, viruses, and mobile elements. With the identification of microRNA and siRNAs in diverse organisms, increasing evidences indicate that these short npcRNAs play important roles in development, stress response and diseases by cleavage of target mRNA or interfere with translation of target genes. To explore the small RNA transcriptome in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a couple of small RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced by high throughput sequencing method. In this review, we focused on the discovery of wheat small RNAs including miRNA and some other non coding small RNAs, then have a view of miRNAs conservations and differences among wheat and other plant species. We also summarized the developmental and stress responsive expression of wheat miRNAs and these observations could serve as a foundation for future functional studies.
