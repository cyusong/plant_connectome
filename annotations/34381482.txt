The involvement of the different <i>Lactuca</i> species in the domestication and diversification of cultivated lettuce is not totally understood. <i>Lactuca serriola</i> is considered as the direct ancestor and the closest relative to <i>Lactuca sativa</i>, while the other wild species that can be crossed with <i>L. sativa</i>, <i>Lactuca virosa</i>, and <i>Lactuca saligna</i>, would have just contributed to the latter diversification of cultivated typologies. To contribute to the study of <i>Lactuca</i> evolution, we assembled the mtDNA genomes of nine <i>Lactuca</i> spp. accessions, among them three from <i>L. virosa</i>, whose mtDNA had not been studied so far. Our results unveiled little to no intraspecies variation among <i>Lactuca</i> species, with the exception of <i>L. serriola</i> where the accessions we sequenced diverge significantly from the mtDNA of a <i>L. serriola</i> accession already reported. Furthermore, we found a remarkable phylogenetic closeness between the mtDNA of <i>L. sativa</i> and the mtDNA of <i>L. virosa</i>, contrasting to the <i>L. serriola</i> origin of the nuclear and plastidial genomes. These results suggest that a cross between <i>L. virosa</i> and the ancestor of cultivated lettuce is at the origin of the actual mitochondrial genome of <i>L. sativa.</i>
