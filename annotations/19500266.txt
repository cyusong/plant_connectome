The main steps for carbon acquisition and conversion by Botrytis cinerea during pathogenesis of sunflower cotyledon were investigated here. A sequential view of soluble carbon metabolites detected by NMR spectroscopy during infection is presented. Disappearance of plant hexoses and their conversion to fungal metabolites were investigated by expression analysis of an extended gene family of hexose transporters (Bchxts) and of the mannitol pathway, using quantitative PCR. In order to analyse the main fungal metabolic routes used by B. cinerea in real time, we performed, for the first time, in vivo NMR analyses during plant infection. During infection, B. cinerea converts plant hexoses into mannitol. Expression analysis of the sugar porter gene family suggested predominance for transcription induced upon low glucose conditions and regulated according to the developmental phase. Allocation of plant hexoses by the pathogen revealed a conversion to mannitol, trehalose and glycogen for glucose and a preponderant transformation of fructose to mannitol by a more efficient metabolic pathway. Uptake of plant hexoses by B. cinerea is based on a multigenic flexible hexose uptake system. Their conversion into mannitol, enabled by two simultaneously expressed pathways, generates a dynamic intracellular carbon pool.

Bchxts: !transcribes! hexose transporters
hexose transporters: !transport! plant hexoses 
plant hexoses: !convert to! mannitol, trehalose, glycogen
fructose: !converts to! mannitol
hexose uptake system: !allocates! plant hexoses
two pathways: !simultaneously express! conversion of hexoses to mannitol
