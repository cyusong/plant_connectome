['20136729', "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of gene expression at the  post-transcriptional level in both plants and animals. However, the specific  functions of MIRNAs (MIRs) and the mechanisms regulating their expression are not  fully understood. Previous studies showed that miR160 negatively regulates three  genes that encode AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARF10, -16, and -17). Here, we  characterized floral organs in carpels (foc), an Arabidopsis mutant with a Ds  transposon insertion in the 3' regulatory region of MIR160a. foc plants exhibit a  variety of intriguing phenotypes, including serrated rosette leaves, irregular  flowers, floral organs inside siliques, reduced fertility, aberrant seeds, and  viviparous seedlings. Detailed phenotypic analysis showed that abnormal cell  divisions in the basal embryo domain and suspensor led to diverse defects during  embryogenesis in foc plants. Further analysis showed that the 3' region was  required for the expression of MIR160a. The accumulation of mature miR160 was  greatly reduced in foc inflorescences. In addition, the expression pattern of  ARF16 and -17 was altered during embryo development in foc plants. foc plants  were also deficient in auxin responses. Moreover, auxin was involved in  regulating the expression of MIR160a through its 3' regulatory region. Our study  not only provides insight into the molecular mechanism of embryo development via  MIR160a-regulated ARFs, but also reveals the mechanism regulating MIR160a  expression.", '2010 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04164.x', 'Zhao']
