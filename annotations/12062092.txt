['12062092', 'Plants recognize many pathogens through the action of a diverse family of  proteins called disease resistance (R) genes. The Arabidopsis R gene RPM1 encodes  resistance to specific Pseudomonas syringae strains. We describe an  RPM1-interacting protein that is an ortholog of TIP49a, previously shown to  interact with the TATA binding protein (TBP) complex and to modulate c-myc- and  beta-catenin-mediated signaling in animals. Reduction of Arabidopsis TIP49a  (AtTIP49a) mRNA levels results in measurable increases of two R-dependent  responses without constitutively activating defense responses, suggesting that  AtTIP49a can act as a negative regulator of at least some R functions. Further,  AtTIP49a is essential for both sporophyte and female gametophyte viability. Thus,  regulators of R function overlap with essential modulators of plant development.', '2002 Jun', 'Dev Cell', '10.1016/s1534-5807(02)00174-0', 'Dangl']
