Colorado potato beetle (CPB) is an agricultural pest of solanaceous crops, notorious for its rapid resistance development to chemical pesticides. Foliar spraying of dsRNA formulations is a promising innovative technology providing highly specific and environmentally acceptable option for CPB management. We designed dsRNA to silence CPB <i>mesh</i> gene (dsMESH) and performed laboratory feeding trials to assess impacts on beetle survival and development. We compared the effectiveness of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> produced dsRNA in a series of laboratory experiments. We additionally performed a field trial in which the efficacy of dsRNA sprayed onto potato foliage was compared to a spinosad-based insecticide. We showed that dsMESH ingestion consistently and significantly impaired larval growth and decreased larval survival in laboratory feeding experiments. <i>In vivo</i> produced dsRNA performed similarly as <i>in vitro</i> synthesized dsRNA in laboratory settings. In the field trial, dsMESH was as effective in controlling CPB larvae as a commercial spinosad insecticide, its activity was however slower. We discuss limitations and benefits of a potential dsMESH-based CPB management strategy and list some important RNAi based CPB research topics, which will have to be addressed in future.

dsRNA: !silences! CPB mesh gene 
CPB mesh gene: !impairs! larval growth 
CPB mesh gene: !decreases! larval survival 
in vivo dsRNA: !performs similarly as! in vitro synthesized dsRNA 
dsMESH: !as effective as! commercial spinosad insecticide
