The roots of legume plant play a crucial role in nitrogen fixation. However, the transcriptomes of different cell types of legume root and their functions remain largely unknown. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and profiled more than 22,000 single cells from root tips of Lotus japonicus, a model species of legume. We identified seven clusters corresponding to seven major cell types, which were validated by in situ hybridization. Further analysis revealed regulatory programs including phytohormone and nodulation associated with specific cell types, and revealed conserved and diverged features for the cell types. Our results represent the first single-cell resolution transcriptome for legume root tips and a valuable resource for studying the developmental and physiological functions of various cell types in legumes.
