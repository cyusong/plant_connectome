Improving far-red light utilization could be an approach to increasing crop production under suboptimal conditions. In land plants, only a small part of far-red light can be used for photosynthesis, which is captured by the antenna proteins LHCAs of photosystem I (PSI) through the chlorophyll (Chl) pair <i>a</i>603 and <i>a</i>609. However, it is unknown how the energy level of Chls <i>a</i>603-<i>a</i>609 is fine-tuned by the local protein environment <i>in vivo</i>. In this study, we investigated how changing the amino acid ligand for Chl <i>a</i>603 in LHCA4, the most red-shifted LHCA in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, or one amino acid near Chl <i>a</i>609, affected the energy level of the resulting PSI-LHCI complexes <i>in situ</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Substitutions of the Chl <i>a</i>603 ligand N99 caused a blue shift in fluorescence emission, whereas the E146Q substitution near Chl <i>a</i>609 expanded the emission range to the red. Purified PSI-LHCI complexes with N99 substitutions exhibited the same fluorescence emission maxima as their respective transgenic lines, while the extent of red shift in purified PSI-LHCI with the E146Q substitution was weaker than in the corresponding transgenic lines. We propose that substituting amino acids surrounding red Chls can tune their energy level higher or lower <i>in vivo</i>, while shifting the absorption spectrum more to the red could prove more difficult than shifting to the blue end of the spectrum. Here, we report the first <i>in vivo</i> exploration of changing the local protein environment on the energy level of the red Chls, providing new clues for engineering red/blue-shifted crops.
