Optimal development of root architecture is vital to the structure and nutrient absorption capabilities of any plant. We recently demonstrated that AtCLE26 regulates A. thaliana root architecture development, possibly by altering auxin distribution to the root apical meristem via inhibition of protophloem development. In addition, we showed that AtCLE26 application is able to induce a root architectural change in the monocots Brachypodium distachyon and Triticum aestivum. Here, we showed that application of the synthetic AtCLE26 peptide similarly affects other important agricultural species, such as Brassica napus and Solanum lycopersicum.
