Cereals accumulate graminan-type fructans which are subject to stress-related degradation by fructan 1-exohydrolases (1-FEHs) and fructan 6-exohydrolases (6-FEHs). To find new FEH genes related to freezing tolerance, a cold-hardened wheat crown cDNA library was screened. Here we report the cloning, purification and characterization of two novel 6-kestosidase (6-KEH) isoenzymes from wheat crowns (Triticum aestivum). Functional characterization in Pichia pastoris confirmed the extreme substrate selectivity for the fructan trisaccharide 6-kestose. Northern blotting showed that 6-KEH transcripts were constantly detected at the same level from autumn to winter in crown but not in leaf tissues. Apoplastic fluid isolations and activity measurements strongly suggest that 6-KEH is localized in the apoplast. It is proposed that 6-KEHs, together with other FEHs, might be involved in the breakdown of apoplastic fructans which may fulfil a role as membrane protectors under stress. Alternatively, a role in signalling processes, or in the degradation of exogenous 6-kestose from bacterial origin, cannot be excluded.
