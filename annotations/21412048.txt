Fab1/PIKfyve produces Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns (3,5) P2) from Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns 3-P), and is involved not only in vacuole/lysosome homeostasis, but also in transporting various proteins to the vacuole or recycling proteins on the plasma membrane (PM) through the use of endosomes in a variety of eukaryotic cells. We previously demonstrated that Arabidopsis FAB1A/B functions as PtdIns 3,5-kinase in both Arabidopsis and fission yeast and plays a key role in vacuolar acidification and endocytosis. Although the conditional FAB1A/B knockdown mutant revealed an auxin-resistant phenotype to a membrane impermeable auxin, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), the mutant did not exhibit this phenotype to a membrane-permeable artificial auxin, naphthalene 1-acetic acid (NAA). The difference in the sensitivities to 2,4-D and NAA is similar to those of the auxin-resistant mutants such as aux1. Taken together, these results suggest that impairment of the function of Arabidopsis FAB1A/B might cause a defect in the membrane recycling capabilities of the auxin transporters and inhibit proper auxin transport into the cells in Arabidopsis.
