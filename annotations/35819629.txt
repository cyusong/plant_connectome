Plant responds to Agrobacterium via three-layered immunity that determines its susceptibility or resistance to Agrobacterium infection. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a soil-borne Gram-negative bacterium that causes crown gall disease in plants. The remarkable feat of interkingdom gene transfer has been extensively utilised in plant biotechnology to transform plant as well as non-host systems. In the past two decades, the molecular mode of the pathogenesis of A. tumefaciens has been extensively studied. Agrobacterium has also been utilised as a premier model to understand the defence response of plants during plant-Agrobacterium interaction. Nonetheless, the threat of Agrobacterium-mediated crown gall disease persists and is associated with a huge loss of plant vigour in agriculture. Understanding the molecular dialogues between these two interkingdom species might provide a cure for crown gall disease. Plants respond to A. tumefaciens by mounting a three-layered immune response, which is manipulated by Agrobacterium via its virulence effector proteins. Comparative studies on plant defence proteins versus the counter-defence of Agrobacterium have shed light on plant susceptibility and tolerance. It is possible to manipulate a plant's immune system to overcome the crown gall disease and increase its competence via A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation. This review summarises the recent advances in the molecular mode of Agrobacterium pathogenesis as well as the three-layered immune response of plants against Agrobacterium infection.
