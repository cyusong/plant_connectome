['22739826', 'The UV-A/blue light photoreceptor crytochrome2 (cry2) plays a fundamental role in  the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase in the facultative  long-day plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The cry2 protein level strongly decreases  when etiolated seedlings are exposed to blue light; cry2 is first phosphorylated,  polyubiquitinated, and then degraded by the 26S proteasome. COP1 is involved in  cry2 degradation, but several cop1 mutants show only reduced but not abolished  cry2 degradation. SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA) proteins are known to work in  concert with COP1, and recently direct physical interaction between cry2 and SPA1  was demonstrated. Thus, we hypothesized that SPA proteins could also play a role  in cry2 degradation. To this end, we analyzed cry2 protein levels in spa mutants.  In all spa mutants analyzed, cry2 degradation under continuous blue light was  alleviated in a fluence rate-dependent manner. Consistent with a role of SPA  proteins in phytochrome A (phyA) signaling, a phyA mutant had enhanced cry2  levels, particularly under low fluence rate blue light. Fluorescence resonance  energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy studies showed a robust  physical interaction of cry2 with SPA1 in nuclei of living cells. Our results  suggest that cry2 stability is controlled by SPA and phyA, thus providing more  information on the molecular mechanisms of interaction between cryptochrome and  phytochrome photoreceptors.', '2012 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.098210', 'Batschauer']
