['14521841', 'Plants progress through a temporal sequence of juvenile, adult, and reproductive  phases, each marked by the expression of phase-specific traits. Here we show that  loss-of-function mutations in ZIPPY (ZIP) cause the premature expression of adult  vegetative traits but do not accelerate the onset of reproductive competence or  flowering time. ZIP encodes ARGONAUTE7 (AGO7), one of ten members of the  ARGONAUTE family in Arabidopsis. In addition to playing developmental roles, some  ARGONAUTE family members are required for RNAi-like phenomena, such as  posttranscriptional gene silencing. In contrast to Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE1, ZIP  has no significant role in transgene silencing; its primary function is in the  regulation of developmental timing.', '2003 Sep 30', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2003.09.004', 'Poethig']
