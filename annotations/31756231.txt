['31756231', "Modified nucleosides in tRNAs are critical for protein translation.  N1-methylguanosine-37 and N1-methylinosine-37 in tRNAs, both located at the  3'-adjacent to the anticodon, are formed by Trm5. Here we describe Arabidopsis  thaliana AtTRM5 (At3g56120) as a Trm5 ortholog. Attrm5 mutant plants have overall  slower growth as observed by slower leaf initiation rate, delayed flowering and  reduced primary root length. In Attrm5 mutants, mRNAs of flowering time genes are  less abundant and correlated with delayed flowering. We show that AtTRM5  complements the yeast trm5 mutant, and in vitro methylates tRNA guanosine-37 to  produce N1-methylguanosine (m1G). We also show in vitro that AtTRM5 methylates  tRNA inosine-37 to produce N1-methylinosine (m1I) and in Attrm5 mutant plants, we  show a reduction of both N1-methylguanosine and N1-methylinosine. We also show  that AtTRM5 is localized to the nucleus in plant cells. Proteomics data showed  that photosynthetic protein abundance is affected in Attrm5 mutant plants.  Finally, we show tRNA-Ala aminoacylation is not affected in Attrm5 mutants.  However the abundance of tRNA-Ala and tRNA-Asp 5' half cleavage products are  deduced. Our findings highlight the bifunctionality of AtTRM5 and the importance  of the post-transcriptional tRNA modifications m1G and m1I at tRNA position 37 in  general plant growth and development.", '2019', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0225064', 'ORCID:']
