The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) has a crucial role in defense responses against pathogens in rice. We recently reported that some volatile compounds accumulate in response to JA treatment, and that the monoterpene linalool plays an important role in JA-induced resistance to rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo) in rice. One of the JA-responsive volatiles, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, has both antibacterial and antifungal activity against Xoo, and the rice fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. In addition, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal was toxic to rice plants. These phenomena were not observed when linalool was treated. These results indicate that accumulation of the (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal in response to JA is a double-edged sword, but it is essential for survival against pathogen attacks in rice.
