The plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) has been shown to be an important sink for photosynthetic electron transport in stress-tolerant plants. However, overexpression studies in stress-sensitive species have previously failed to induce significant activity of this protein. Here we show that overexpression of PTOX from the salt-tolerant brassica species <i>Eutrema salsugineum</i> does not, alone, result in activity, but that overexpressing plants show faster induction and a greater final level of PTOX activity once exposed to salt stress. This implies that an additional activation step is required before activity is induced. We show that that activation involves the translocation of the protein from the unstacked stromal lamellae to the thylakoid grana and a protection of the protein from trypsin digestion. This represents an important activation step and opens up possibilities in the search for stress-tolerant crops.
