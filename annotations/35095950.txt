<i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> tropical race 4 (<i>Foc</i>TR4) is a destructive necrotrophic fungal pathogen afflicting global banana production. Infection process involves the activation of programmed cell death (PCD). In this study, seven <i>Musa acuminata vacuolar processing enzyme</i> (<i>MaVPE1</i>-<i>MaVPE7</i>) genes associated with PCD were successfully identified. Phylogenetic analysis and tissue-specific expression categorized these MaVPEs into the seed and vegetative types. <i>Foc</i>TR4 infection induced the majority of <i>MaVPE</i> expressions in the susceptible cultivar "Berangan" as compared to the resistant cultivar "Jari Buaya." Consistently, upon <i>Foc</i>TR4 infection, high caspase-1 activity was detected in the susceptible cultivar, while low level of caspase-1 activity was recorded in the resistant cultivar. Furthermore, inhibition of MaVPE activities <i>via</i> caspase-1 inhibitor in the susceptible cultivar reduced tonoplast rupture, decreased lesion formation, and enhanced stress tolerance against <i>Foc</i>TR4 infection. Additionally, the <i>Arabidopsis VPE</i>-null mutant exhibited higher tolerance to <i>Foc</i>TR4 infection, indicated by reduced sporulation rate, low levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content, and high levels of cell viability. Comparative proteomic profiling analysis revealed increase in the abundance of cysteine proteinase in the inoculated susceptible cultivar, as opposed to cysteine proteinase inhibitors in the resistant cultivar. In conclusion, the increase in vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE)-mediated PCD played a crucial role in modulating susceptibility response during compatible interaction, which facilitated <i>Foc</i>TR4 colonization in the host.
