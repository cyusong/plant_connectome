The B-BOX (BBX) proteins have important functions in regulating plant growth and development. In plants, the BBX gene family has been identified in several plants, such as rice, Arabidopsis and tomato. However, there still lack a genome-wide survey of BBX genes in pear. In the present study, a total of 25 BBX genes were identified in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd.). Subsequently, phylogenetic relationship, gene structure, gene duplication, transcriptome data and qRT-PCR were conducted on these BBX gene members. The transcript analysis revealed that twelve PbBBX genes (48%) were specifically expressed in pear pollen tubes. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis indicated that both PbBBX4 and PbBBX13 have potential role in pear fruit development, while PbBBX5 should be involved in the senescence of pear pollen tube. This study provided a genome-wide survey of BBX gene family in pear, and highlighted its roles in both pear fruits and pollen tubes. The results will be useful in improving our understanding of the complexity of BBX gene family and functional characteristics of its members in future study.
