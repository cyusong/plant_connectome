['25324386', 'Nitrogen (N) is a critical nutrient for plants but is often distributed unevenly  in the soil. Plants therefore have evolved a systemic mechanism by which N  starvation on one side of the root system leads to a compensatory and increased  nitrate uptake on the other side. Here, we study the molecular systems that  support perception of N and the long-distance signaling needed to alter root  development. Rootlets starved of N secrete small peptides that are translocated  to the shoot and received by two leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs).  Arabidopsis plants deficient in this pathway show growth retardation accompanied  with N-deficiency symptoms. Thus, signaling from the root to the shoot helps the  plant adapt to fluctuations in local N availability.', '2014 Oct 17', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1257800', 'Matsubayashi']
