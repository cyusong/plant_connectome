Plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are involved in nearly all aspects of plant life including growth, development and stress response. Recent studies show that FERONIA (FER), a CrRLK1L subfamily member, is a versatile regulator of cell expansion and serves as a signaling node mediating cross-talk among multiple phytohormones. As a receptor for the RALF (Rapid Alkalinization Factor) peptide ligand, FER triggers a downstream signaling cascade that leads to a rapid cytoplasmic calcium increase and inhibition of cell elongation in plants. Moreover, FER recruits and activates small G proteins through the guanine nucleotide exchange factor-Rho-like GTPase (GEF-ROP) network to regulate both auxin and ABA responses that cross-talk with the RALF signaling pathway. One of the downstream processes is NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS (reactive oxygen species) production that modulates cell expansion and responses to both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Intriguingly, some pathogenic fungi produce RALF-like peptides to activate the host FER-mediated pathway and thus increase their virulence and cause plant disease. Studies so far indicate that FER may serve as a central node of the cell signaling network that integrates a number of regulatory pathways targeting cell expansion, energy metabolism and stress responses. This review focuses on recent findings and their implications in the context of FER action as a modulator that is crucial for hormone signaling and stress responses.
