Physiological responses to abiotic stress in plants exhibit sexual differences. Females usually experience greater negative effects than males; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of sexual differences in abiotic stress responses. In the present study, transcriptional responses to salinity treatments were compared between male and female individuals of the poplar Populus yunnanensis. It was found that several functional groups of genes involved in important pathways were differentially expressed, including photosynthesis-related genes, which were mainly up-regulated in males but down-regulated in females. This gene expression pattern is consistent with physiological observations showing that salinity inhibited photosynthetic capacity more in females than in males. Furthermore, genes located in autosomes rather than in the female-specific region of the W chromosome are the major contributors to the sexual differences in the salinity tolerance of poplars. In conclusion, this study provided molecular evidence of sexual differences in the salinity tolerance of poplars. The identified sex-related genes in salinity tolerance and their functional groups will enhance our understanding of sexual differences in salinity stress at the transcription level.
