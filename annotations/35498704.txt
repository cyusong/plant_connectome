Wheat is among the top 10 and most widely grown crops in the world. However, wheat is often infected with many soil-borne diseases, including sharp eyespot, mainly caused by the necrotrophic fungus <i>Rhizoctonia cerealis</i>, and Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, resulting in reduced production. <i>Piriformospora indica</i> is a root endophytic fungus with a wide range of host plants, which increases their growth and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, the capability of <i>P. indica</i> to protect wheat seedlings against <i>R. cerealis</i> and <i>F. graminearum</i> was investigated at the physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels. Our results showed that <i>P. indica</i> significantly reduced the disease progress on wheat caused by <i>F. graminearum</i> and <i>R. cerealis in vivo</i>, but not showed any antagonistic effect on <i>F. graminearum</i> and <i>R. cerealis in vitro</i>. Additionally, <i>P. indica</i> can induce systemic resistance by elevating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content, antioxidase activity, relative water content (RWC), and membrane stability index (MSI) compared to the plants only inoculated with <i>F. graminearum</i> or <i>R. cerealis</i> and control. RNA-seq suggested that transcriptome changes caused by <i>F. graminearum</i> were more severe than those caused by <i>R. cerealis.</i> The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the transcriptome can be reduced by the addition of <i>P. indica:</i> for <i>F. graminearum</i> reduced by 18% and for <i>R. cerealis</i> reduced 58%. The DEGs related to disease resistance, such as WRKY and MAPK, were upregulated by <i>P. indica</i> colonization. The data further revealed that the transcriptional resistance to <i>F. graminearum</i> and <i>R. cerealis</i> mediated by <i>P. indica</i> is quite different.
