The CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC) transcription factors play a fundamental role in plant morphogenesis by defining boundary domains throughout plant development. Despite their central roles in plant development, little is known about the CUC molecular network. In a recent work, we identified a role for MUR1, a protein involved in the production of GDP-L-Fucose, in this network and showed that fucose per se is required for proper boundary definition in various developmental contexts. Which pathway involving fucose is required to determine boundary is not yet known. Here, we use a previously described mutant and transgenic line with reduced fucosylated xyloglucans (XyG) to explore one such pathway. By quantitatively comparing leaf shape, we show that defects in XyG fucosylation do not impact leaf serrations development suggesting that fucose absence in XyG does not impact boundary development in mur1-1 mutant. Thus another - not yet identified - pathway or fucosylated compound contribute to boundary domain definition.

CUC: !defines! boundary domains
MUR1: !involves in! production of GDP-L-Fucose
fucose: !required for! proper boundary definition
mutant/transgenic line: !reduces! fucosylated xyloglucans
leaf shape: !quantitatively compared to! show defects in XyG fucosylation
mur1-1 mutant: !does not impact! leaf serrations development
