Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are popular tools for high-throughput phenotyping of crops in the field. However, their use for evaluation of individual lines is limited in crop breeding because research on what the UAV image data represent is still developing. Here, we investigated the connection between shoot biomass of rice plants and the vegetation fraction (VF) estimated from high-resolution orthomosaic images taken by a UAV 10 m above a field during the vegetative stage. Haplotype-based genome-wide association studies of multi-parental advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) lines revealed four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for VF. VF was correlated with shoot biomass, but the haplotype effect on VF was better correlated with that on shoot biomass at these QTLs. Further genetic characterization revealed the relationships between these QTLs and plant spreading habit, final shoot biomass and panicle weight. Thus, genetic analysis using high-throughput phenotyping data derived from low-altitude, high-resolution UAV images during early stages of rice growing in the field provides insights into plant growth, architecture, final biomass, and yield.
