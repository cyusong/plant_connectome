Every textbook says that land plants are primary producers and, as such, are eaten. A couple of plants, however, refuse to stay within the boundaries of their trophic level - the carnivorous plants. Now, a new genomic study pinpoints the genetic chassis that underpins carnivory in Venus flytrap, waterwheel plant, and sundew.

Gene: !affects! Carnivory 
Gene: !localizes to! Venus flytrap 
Gene: !localizes to! Waterwheel plant 
Gene: !localizes to! Sundew
