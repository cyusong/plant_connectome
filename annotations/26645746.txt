Arabidopsis thaliana has long been the model plant of choice for elucidating the mechanisms of the circadian clock. Recently, relevant results have accumulated in other species of green plant lineages, including green algae. This mini-review describes a comparison of the mechanism of the A. thaliana clock to those of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the moss Physcomitrella patens, focusing on commonalities and divergences of subsystems of the clock. The potential of such an approach from an evolutionary viewpoint is discussed.
