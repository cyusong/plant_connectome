['15525519', 'Homologous recombination (HR) serves a dual role in providing genetic flexibility  and in maintaining genome integrity. Little is known about the regulation of HR  and other repair pathways in the context of chromatin. We report on a mutant  affected in the expression of the Arabidopsis INO80 ortholog of the SWI/SNF  ATPase family, which shows a reduction of the HR frequency to 15% of that in  wild-type plants. In contrast, sensitivity to genotoxic agents and efficiency of  T-DNA integration remain unaffected, suggesting that INO80 is a positive  regulator of HR, while not affecting other repair pathways. So far, INO80  function has only been reported in a lower eukaryote. Profiling studies on three  ino80 allelic mutants show that INO80 regulates nearly 100 Arabidopsis genes.  However, the transcriptional regulation of repair-related genes is unaffected in  the mutant. This suggests a dual role for INO80 in transcription and DNA repair  by HR.', '2004 Nov 5', 'Mol Cell', '10.1016/j.molcel.2004.09.034', 'Hohn']
