['9824308', 'In seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana the thionin gene Thi2.1 is inducible by  methyl jasmonate, wounding, silver nitrate, coronatine, and sorbitol. We have  used a biochemical and genetic approach to test the signal transduction of these  different inducers. Both exogenously applied jasmonates and jasmonates produced  endogenously upon stress induction, lead to GUS expression in a Thi2.1  promoter-uidA transgenic line. No GUS expression was observed in a coil mutant  background which lacks jasmonate perception whereas methyl jasmonate and  coronatine but not the other inducers were able to overcome the block in jasmonic  acid production in a fad3-2 fad7-2 fad8 mutant background. Our results show  conclusively that all these inducers regulate Thi2-1 gene expression via the  octadecanoid pathway.', '1998 Oct 23', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(98)01251-4', 'Apel']
