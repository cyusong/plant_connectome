Hormonal regulation of root development is a long known phenomenon. In the past decades, the molecular mechanisms of individual hormonal pathways and their impact on root development have been studied. Recent genetic and molecular studies suggest importance of interactions of the individual hormonal pathways and their components. In our paper we show impact of endogenous cytokinin on the root architecture and its interaction with auxin in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this addendum we discuss our results in the light of significant recent papers that deal with cytokinin-auxin interactions and we point out spatiotemporal specificity of these interactions in the root development.

Cytokinin: !affects! Root architecture 
Cytokinin: !interacts with! Auxin 
Auxin: !interacts with! Cytokinin 
Cytokinin-Auxin Interaction: !has spatiotemporal specificity! in root development
