['12070171', 'The vacuole/lysosome serves an important recycling function during starvation and  senescence in eukaryotes via a process called autophagy. Here bulk cytosolic  constituents and organelles become sequestered in specialized autophagic  vesicles, which then deliver their cargo to the vacuole for degradation. In  yeasts, genetic screens have identified two novel post-translational modification  pathways remarkably similar to ubiquitination that are required for autophagy.  From searches of the Arabidopsis genome, we have identified gene families  encoding proteins related to both the APG8 and -12 polypeptide tags and orthologs  for all components required for their attachment. A single APG7 gene encodes the  ATP-dependent activating enzyme that initiates both conjugation pathways.  Phenotypic analysis of an APG7 disruption indicates that it is not essential for  normal growth and development in Arabidopsis. However, the apg7-1 mutant is  hypersensitive to nutrient limiting conditions and displays premature leaf  senescence. mRNAs for both APG7 and APG8 preferentially accumulate as leaves  senesce, suggesting that both conjugation pathways are up-regulated during the  senescence syndrome. These findings show that the APG8/12 conjugation pathways  have been conserved in plants and may have important roles in autophagic  recycling, especially during situations that require substantial nitrogen and  carbon mobilization.', '2002 Sep 6', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M204630200', 'Vierstra']
