Shoot apical meristem (SAM) and root apical meristem (RAM) homeostasis is tightly regulated by CLAVATA3 (CLV3)/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-related (CLE) peptide signaling. However, the intracellular signaling components after CLV3 is perceived by the CLV1-CLV3-INSENSITIVE KINASE (CIK) receptor complex and CLE25/26/45 are sensed by the BARELY ANY MERISTEM (BAM)-CIK receptor complex are unknown. Here, we report that PBS1-LIKE34/35/36 (PBL34/35/36), a clade of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases, are required for both CLV3-mediated signaling in the SAM and CLE25/26/45-mediated signaling in the RAM. Physiological assays showed that the SAM and RAM of pbl34 pbl35 pbl36 were resistant to CLV3 and CLE25/26/45 treatment, respectively. Genetic analyses indicated that pbl34 pbl35 pbl36 greatly enhanced the SAM defects of clv2 and rpk2 but not clv1, and did not show additive effects with bam3 and cik2 in the RAM. Further biochemical assays revealed that PBL34/35/36 interacted with CLV1, BAM1/3, and CIKs, and were phosphorylated by CLV1 and BAM1. All these results suggest that PBL34/35/36 act downstream of CLV1 and BAM1/3 to mediate the CLV3 and CLE25/26/45 signals in maintaining SAM and RAM homeostasis, respectively. Our findings shed light on how CLE signals are transmitted intracellularly after being perceived by cell surface receptor complexes.
