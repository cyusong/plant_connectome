Weeds play an important role in agriculture and molecular techniques are useful to help understand traits that contribute to weediness and weeds' interactions with the environment. A total of 377 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a modest library were arranged into 227 unique fragments and 61 contigs, which consisted of two or more ESTs. From blastx results, we mapped and annotated unigenes using the gene ontology vocabulary according to biological process, cellular component and molecular function. These were then compared to a reference set of Arabidopsis thaliana sequences for statistically significant over- or underrepresented genes. The sequences were also compared against multiple protein databases for similarity of functional domains. Overall, the S. iberica sequences showed high similarity to response to stress, which included salt-induced proteins, betaine aldehydehyde dehydrogenase and calcium binding proteins. Only a modest number of transcripts were sequenced; however, the results presented here demonstrate the metabolic versatility of S. iberica in sub-optimal conditions that are likely to contribute to its cosmopolitan distribution. Here we propose that an EST library of an economically important weed species could be used to understand the weed's interactions with the environment.
