['27694184', 'Activation of the guard cell S-type anion channel SLAC1 is important for stomatal  closure in response to diverse stimuli, including elevated CO(2) The majority of  known SLAC1 activation mechanisms depend on abscisic acid (ABA) signaling.  Several lines of evidence point to a parallel ABA-independent mechanism of  CO(2)-induced stomatal regulation; however, molecular details of this pathway  remain scarce. Here, we isolated a dominant mutation in the protein kinase HIGH  LEAF TEMPERATURE1 (HT1), an essential regulator of stomatal CO(2) responses, in  an ozone sensitivity screen of Arabidopsis thaliana The mutation caused  constitutively open stomata and impaired stomatal CO(2) responses. We show that  the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) MPK4 and MPK12 can inhibit HT1  activity in vitro and this inhibition is decreased for the dominant allele of  HT1. We also show that HT1 inhibits the activation of the SLAC1 anion channel by  the protein kinases OPEN STOMATA1 and GUARD CELL HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-RESISTANT1  (GHR1) in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Notably, MPK12 can restore SLAC1 activation in  the presence of HT1, but not in the presence of the dominant allele of HT1. Based  on these data, we propose a model for sequential roles of MPK12, HT1, and GHR1 in  the ABA-independent regulation of SLAC1 during CO(2)-induced stomatal closure.', '2016 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00131', 'ORCID:']
