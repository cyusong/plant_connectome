The annual planting area of major inbred rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars reach more than half of the total annual planting area of inbred rice cultivars in China. However, how the major inbred rice cultivars changed during decades of genetic improvement and why they can be prevalently cultivated in China remains unclear. Here, we investigated the underlying genetic changes of major inbred cultivars and the contributions of landraces and introduced cultivars during the improvement by resequencing a collection of 439 rice accessions including major inbred cultivars, landraces, and introduced cultivars. The results showed that landraces were the main genetic contribution sources of major inbred Xian (Indica) cultivars, while introduced cultivars were that of major inbred Geng (Japonica) cultivars. Selection scans and haplotype frequency analysis shed light on the reflections of some well-known genes in rice improvement, and breeders had different preferences for the Xian's and Geng's breeding. Six candidate regions associated with agronomic traits were identified by genome-wide association mapping, five of which were under positive selection in rice improvement. Our study provides a comprehensive insight into the development of major inbred rice cultivars and lays the foundation for genomics-based breeding in rice.
