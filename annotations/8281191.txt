['8281191', 'A general amino acid permease cDNA (AAP2) was isolated from Arabidopsis by  complementation of a yeast mutant defective in citrulline uptake. Direct  transport measurements in yeast show that the protein mediates uptake of  L-[14C]-citrulline and L-[14C]-proline. Detailed analyses of the substrate  specificity by competition studies demonstrate that all proteogenic amino acids  are recognized by the carrier, including those that represent the major transport  forms of reduced nitrogen in many species, i.e. glutamine, glutamate and  asparagine. Thus, AAP2 is less selective as compared with AAP1 and transports  basic amino acids such as histidine as shown by expression in a histidine  transport-deficient yeast strain. The predicted polypeptide of 53 kDa is highly  hydrophobic with 12 putative membrane-spanning regions and shows significant  homologies to the Arabidopsis broad specificity permease AAP1, and a limited  homology to bacterial branched chain amino acid transporters, but not to any  other known proteins. Alterations in the charged residues as compared with AAP1  in four regions might be involved in the difference in selectivity towards basic  amino acids. Both genes are highly expressed in developing pods indicating a role  in supplying the developing seeds with reduced nitrogen. AAP2 is selectively  expressed in the stem and might therefore play a role in xylem-to-phloem transfer  of amino acids during seed filling. Furthermore in situ hybridization shows that  both genes are expressed in the vascular system of cotyledons in developing  seedlings.', '1993 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1993.04060993.x', 'Frommer']
