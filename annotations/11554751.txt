['11554751', 'Plant nuclear genomes encode chloroplast division proteins homologous to the  eubacterial cell division protein FtsZ. In higher plants, FtsZ genes constitute a  small gene family that consists of two subgroups, FtsZ1 and FtsZ2. It was  previously hypothesized that members of one family (FtsZ1) targeted chloroplasts,  while members of the other family (FtsZ2) localized in the cytoplasm. We  determined the full-length cDNA sequences of two FtsZ2 genes from Arabidopsis  thaliana (AtFtsZ2-1 and AtFtsZ2-2) and found that the genes encode polypeptides  of 478 and 473 amino acids, respectively, and both contain N-terminal extensions  beyond what have previously been predicted. The N-terminal regions of both  AtFtsZ2-1 and AtFtsZ2-2 were expressed as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions  under the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in bombarded tobacco cells.  Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed both fusions exclusively localized to  chloroplasts, demonstrating that the N-terminal regions function as  chloroplast-targeting signals in vivo. Thus, FtsZ2 proteins function within  chloroplasts.', '2001 Sep 21', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1006/bbrc.2001.5588', 'Yoshida']
