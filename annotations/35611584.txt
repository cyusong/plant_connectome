Rhizobial lipochitooligosaccharidic Nod factors (NFs), specified by nod genes, are the primary determinants of host specificity in the legume-Rhizobia symbiosis. We examined the nodulation ability of Medicago truncatula cv Jemalong A17 and M. truncatula ssp. tricycla R108 with the Sinorhizobium meliloti nodF/nodL mutant, which produces modified NFs. We then applied genetic and functional approaches to study the genetic basis and mechanism of nodulation of R108 by this mutant. We show that the nodF/nodL mutant can nodulate R108 but not A17. Using genomics and reverse genetics, we identified a newly evolved, chimeric LysM receptor-like kinase gene in R108, LYK2bis, which is responsible for the phenotype and can allow A17 to gain nodulation with the nodF/nodL mutant. We found that LYK2bis is involved in nodulation by mutants producing nonO-acetylated NFs and interacts with the key receptor protein NFP. Many, but not all, natural S. meliloti and S. medicae strains tested require LYK2bis for efficient nodulation of R108. Our findings reveal that a newly evolved gene in R108, LYK2bis, extends nodulation specificity to mutants producing nonO-acetylated NFs and is important for nodulation by many natural Sinorhizobia. Evolution of this gene may present an adaptive advantage to allow nodulation by a greater variety of strains.
