['15469499', 'Protein function is often mediated via formation of stable or transient  complexes. Here we report the determination of protein-protein interactions in  plants using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). The yellow  fluorescent protein (YFP) was split into two non-overlapping N-terminal (YN) and  C-terminal (YC) fragments. Each fragment was cloned in-frame to a gene of  interest, enabling expression of fusion proteins. To demonstrate the feasibility  of BiFC in plants, two pairs of interacting proteins were utilized: (i) the alpha  and beta subunits of the Arabidopsis protein farnesyltransferase (PFT), and (ii)  the polycomb proteins, FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE) and MEDEA (MEA).  Members of each protein pair were transiently co-expressed in leaf epidermal  cells of Nicotiana benthamiana or Arabidopsis. Reconstitution of a fluorescing  YFP chromophore occurred only when the inquest proteins interacted. No  fluorescence was detected following co-expression of free non-fused YN and YC or  non-interacting protein pairs. Yellow fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm  of cells that expressed PFT alpha and beta subunits, or in nuclei and cytoplasm  of cells that expressed FIE and MEA. In vivo measurements of fluorescence spectra  emitted from reconstituted YFPs were identical to that of a non-split YFP,  confirming reconstitution of the chromophore. Expression of the inquest proteins  was verified by immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibodies directed against  tags within the hybrid proteins. In addition, protein interactions were confirmed  by immunoprecipitations. These results demonstrate that plant BiFC is a simple,  reliable and relatively fast method for determining protein-protein interactions  in plants.', '2004 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02206.x', 'Ohad']
