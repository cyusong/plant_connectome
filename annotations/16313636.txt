['16313636', 'The closely related proteins AtFH4 and AtFH8 represent the group Ie clade of  Arabidopsis formin homologues. The subcellular localization of these proteins and  their ability to affect the actin cytoskeleton were examined. AtFH4 protein  activity was identified using fluorimetric techniques. Interactions between  Arabidopsis profilin isoforms and AtFH4 were assayed in vitro and in vivo using  pull-down assays and yeast-2-hybrid. The subcellular localization of group Ie  formins was observed with indirect immunofluorescence (AtFH4) and an  ethanol-inducible green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct (AtFH8). AtFH4  protein affected actin dynamics in vitro, and yeast-2-hybrid assays suggested  isoform-specific interactions with the actin-binding protein profilin in vivo.  Indirect immunofluorescence showed that AtFH4 localized specifically to the cell  membrane at borders between adjoining cells. Expression of an AtFH8 fusion  protein resulted in GFP localization to cell membrane zones, similar to AtFH4.  Furthermore, aberrant expression of AtFH8 resulted in the inhibition of root hair  elongation. Taken together, these data suggest that the group Ie formins act with  profilin to regulate actin polymerization at specific sites associated with the  cell membrane.', '2005 Dec', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01582.x', 'Hussey']
