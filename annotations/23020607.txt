['23020607', 'Brassinosteroids (BRs) are essential for various aspects of plant development.  Cellular BR homeostasis is critical for proper growth and development of plants;  however, its regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. BAT1 (BR-related  acyltransferase 1), a gene encoding a putative acyltransferase, was found to be  involved in vascular bundle development in a full-length cDNA over-expressor  (FOX) screen. Over-expression of BAT1 resulted in typical BR-deficient  phenotypes, which were rescued by exogenously applied castasterone and  brassinolide. Analyses of BR profiles demonstrated that BAT1 alters levels of  several brassinolide biosynthetic intermediates, including 6-deoxotyphasterol,  typhasterol and 6-deoxocastasterone. BAT1 is mainly localized in the endoplasmic  reticulum. BAT1 is highly expressed in young tissues and vascular bundles, and  its expression is induced by auxin. These data suggest that BAT1 is involved in  BR homeostasis, probably by conversion of brassinolide intermediates into  acylated BR conjugates.', '2013 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12036', 'Hwang']
