Solidago canadensis, originating from the temperate region of North America, has expanded southward to subtropical regions through polyploidization. Here we investigated whether freezing tolerance of S. canadensis was weakened during expansion. Measurement of the temperature causing 50% ruptured cells (LT<sub>50</sub> ) in 35 S. canadensis populations revealed ploidy-related differentiation in freezing tolerance. Freezing tolerance was found to decrease with increasing ploidy. The polyploid populations of S. canadensis had lower ScICE1 gene expression levels but more ScICE1 gene copies than the diploids. Furthermore, more DNA methylation sites in the ScICE1 gene promoter were detected in the polyploids than in the diploids. The results suggest that promoter methylation represses the expression of multi-copy ScICE1 genes, leading to weaker freezing tolerance in polyploid S. canadensis compared to the diploids. The study provides empirical evidence that DNA methylation regulates expression of the gene copies and supports polyploidization-driven adaptation to new environments.

ScICE1: !represses! Freezing tolerance
ScICE1: !synthesizes! DNA methylation sites
Ploidy: !affects! Freezing tolerance
DNA methylation: !regulates! ScICE1 expression
