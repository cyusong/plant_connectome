Heat stress severely affects plant growth and crop production. It is therefore urgent to uncover the mechanisms underlying heat stress responses of plants and establish the strategies to enhance heat tolerance of crops. The chloroplasts and mitochondria are known to be highly sensitive to heat stress. Heat stress negatively impacts on the electron transport chains, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can cause damages on the chloroplasts and mitochondria. Disruptions of photosynthetic and respiratory metabolisms under heat stress also trigger increase in ROS and alterations in redox status in the chloroplasts and mitochondria. However, ROS and altered redox status in these organelles also activate important mechanisms that maintain functions of these organelles under heat stress, which include HSP-dependent pathways, ROS scavenging systems and retrograde signaling. To discuss heat responses associated with energy regulating organelles, we should not neglect the energy regulatory hub involving TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) and SNF-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE 1 (SnRK1). Although roles of TOR and SnRK1 in the regulation of heat responses are still unknown, contributions of these proteins to the regulation of the functions of energy producing organelles implicate the possible involvement of this energy regulatory hub in heat acclimation of plants.
