['17676062', 'Polycomb proteins are required for maintenance of silent chromatin states via  histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in animals, but homologs are not found  in plant genomes. Using a DamID-chip method, we found that the Arabidopsis  thaliana chromodomain-containing protein LHP1 colocalizes with H3K27me3  genome-wide. The LHP1 chromodomain also binds H3K27me3 with high affinity,  suggesting that LHP1 has functions similar to those of Polycomb.', '2007 Sep', 'Nat Struct Mol Biol', '10.1038/nsmb1283', 'Jacobsen']
