Bacterial panicle blight caused by <i>Burkholderia glumae</i> is a major disease in rice production worldwide. Currently, only a few whole-genome sequences of <i>B. glumae</i> strains isolated in the United States are available. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of four <i>B. glumae</i> strains, including three virulent strains (336gr-1, 411gr-6, and 957856-41-c) and the nonpathogenic strain <i>B. glumae</i> 257sh-1, which were isolated from rice fields in Louisiana (336gr-1, 957856-41-c, and 257sh-1) and Arkansas (411gr-6). The whole-genome sequence data of <i>B. glumae</i> strains will contribute to investigations of the molecular mechanism underlying bacterial pathogenicity and virulence to rice plants.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
