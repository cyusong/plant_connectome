Roots remain an underexplored frontier in plant genetics despite their well-known influence on plant development, agricultural performance and competition in the wild. Visualizing and measuring root structures and their growth is vastly more difficult than characterizing aboveground parts of the plant and is often simply avoided. The majority of research on maize root systems has focused on their anatomy, physiology, development and soil interaction, but much less is known about the genetics that control quantitative traits. In maize, seven root development genes have been cloned using mutagenesis, but no genes underlying the many root-related quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified. In this review, we discuss whether the maize mutants known to control root development may also influence quantitative aspects of root architecture, including the extent to which they overlap with the most recent maize root trait QTLs. We highlight specific challenges and anticipate the impacts that emerging technologies, especially computational approaches, may have toward the identification of genes controlling root quantitative traits.
