Spontaneous post-transcriptional silencing of sense transgenes (S-PTGS) is established in each generation and is accompanied by DNA methylation, but the pathway of PTGS-dependent DNA methylation is unknown and so is its role. Here we show that CHH and CHG methylation coincides spatially and temporally with RDR6-dependent products derived from the central and 3' regions of the coding sequence, and requires the components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway NRPE1, DRD1 and DRM2, but not CLSY1, NRPD1, RDR2 or DCL3, suggesting that RDR6-dependent products, namely long dsRNAs and/or siRNAs, trigger PTGS-dependent DNA methylation. Nevertheless, none of these RdDM components are required to establish S-PTGS or produce a systemic silencing signal. Moreover, preventing de novo DNA methylation in non-silenced transgenic tissues grafted onto homologous silenced tissues does not inhibit the triggering of PTGS. Overall, these data indicate that gene body DNA methylation is a consequence, not a cause, of PTGS, and rule out the hypothesis that a PTGS-associated DNA methylation signal is transmitted independent of a PTGS signal.
