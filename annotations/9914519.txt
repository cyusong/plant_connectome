['9914519', "We have expressed in Escerichia coli the enzymes geranylgeranyl diphosphate  synthase and phytoene synthase, from the soil bacterium Erwinia stewartii, and  the two carotene desaturases phytoene desaturase and carotene zeta-carotene  desaturase from Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that pro-lycopene  (7,9,7',9'-tetra-cis)-lycopene is the main end product of the plant desaturation  pathway in these cells. In addition, light is required in this system. Whereas in  the dark mainly zeta-carotene, the phytoene desaturase product, accumulates,  illumination leads to activation of this intermediate caused by its  photoisomerization. zeta-Carotene then meets the stereospecific requirements of  zeta-carotene desaturase and pro-lycopene is formed. In contrast, a strain of E.  coli carrying geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, phytoene desaturase and the  bacterial carotene desaturase CrtI, which mediates lycopene formation from  phytoene, does not require light, nor is a poly-cis-lycopene species formed. The  stereoselectivity of the plant-type desaturation pathway expressed in E. coli is  the same as previously shown with chromoplast membranes. As the phytoene  desaturase and zeta-carotene desaturase used originate from a system not capable  of developing chromoplasts, this indicates that the poly-cis pathway of carotene  desaturation may have a wider occurrence than initially believed.", '1999 Jan', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00051.x', 'Beyer']
