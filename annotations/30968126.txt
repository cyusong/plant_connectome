Interactions between legumes and rhizobia lead to the establishment of a symbiotic relationship characterized by the formation of a new organ, the nodule, which facilitates the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) by nitrogenase through the creation of a hypoxic environment. Significant amounts of nitric oxide (NO) accumulate at different stages of nodule development, suggesting that NO performs specific signaling and/or metabolic functions during symbiosis. NO, which regulates nodule gene expression, accumulates to high levels in hypoxic nodules. NO accumulation is considered to assist energy metabolism within the hypoxic environment of the nodule via a phytoglobin-NO-mediated respiration process. NO is a potent inhibitor of the activity of nitrogenase and other plant and bacterial enzymes, acting as a developmental signal in the induction of nodule senescence. Hence, key questions concern the relative importance of the signaling and metabolic functions of NO versus its toxic action and how NO levels are regulated to be compatible with nitrogen fixation functions. This review analyses these paradoxical roles of NO at various stages of symbiosis, and highlights the role of plant phytoglobins and bacterial hemoproteins in the control of NO accumulation.
