The advent of next generation sequencing has influenced every aspect of biological research. Many labs are now using whole genome sequencing in Arabidopsis thaliana as a means to quickly identify EMS-generated mutations present in isolated mutants. Following identification of these mutations, examination of T-DNA insertional alleles defective in candidate genes or complementation of the mutant phenotype with a wild type copy of candidate genes can be used to verify which mutation is causative for the phenotype of interest. Here, we discuss the benefits and pitfalls of using this method to identify mutations underlying phenotypes.
