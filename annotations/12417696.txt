['12417696', 'The formation of the venation pattern in leaves is ideal for examining signaling  pathways that recognize and respond to spatial and temporal information, because  the pattern is two-dimensional and heritable and the resulting veins influence  the three-dimensional spatial organization of the surrounding differentiating  leaf cell types. We identified a provascular/procambial cell-specific gene that  encodes a Leu-rich repeat receptor kinase, which we named VASCULAR HIGHWAY1  (VH1). A change in the expression domain and level of VH1 marks the transition  from an uncommitted provascular state to a committed procambial state in early  vascular development. The coding sequence, expression pattern, and transgenic  phenotypes together suggest that VH1 transduces extracellular spatial and  temporal signals into downstream cell differentiation responses in  provascular/procambial cells.', '2002 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.005884', 'Nelson']
