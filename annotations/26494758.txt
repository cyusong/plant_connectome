['26494758', 'Pollen grains undergo dramatic changes in cellular water potential as they  deliver the male germ line to female gametes, and it has been proposed that  mechanosensitive ion channels may sense the resulting mechanical stress. Here, we  identify and characterize MscS-like 8 (MSL8), a pollen-specific, membrane  tension-gated ion channel required for pollen to survive the hypoosmotic shock of  rehydration and for full male fertility. MSL8 negatively regulates pollen  germination but is required for cellular integrity during germination and tube  growth. MSL8 thus senses and responds to changes in membrane tension associated  with pollen hydration and germination. These data further suggest that homologs  of bacterial MscS have been repurposed in eukaryotes to function as  mechanosensors in multiple developmental and environmental contexts.', '2015 Oct 23', 'Science', '10.1126/science.aac6014', 'Haswell']
