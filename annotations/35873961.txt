N6-methyladenine (6mA) DNA modification has been detected in several eukaryotic organisms, in some of them, it plays important role in the regulation process of stress-resistance response. However, the genome-wide distribution patterns and potential functions of 6mA DNA modification in halophyte Seashore paspalum (<i>Paspalum vaginatum</i>) remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the 6mA landscape in the <i>P. vaginatum</i> genome by adopting single molecule real-time sequencing technology and found that 6mA modification sites were broadly distributed across the <i>P. vaginatum</i> genome. We demonstrated distinct 6mA methylation levels and 6mA distribution patterns in different types of transcription genes, which hinted at different epigenetic rules. Furthermore, the moderate 6mA density genes in <i>P. vaginatum</i> functionally correlated with stress resistance, which also maintained a higher transcriptional level. On the other hand, a specific 6mA distribution pattern in the gene body and near TSS was observed in gene groups with higher RNA expression, which maybe implied some kind of regularity between 6mA site distribution and the protein coding genes transcription was possible. Our study provides new insights into the association between 6mA methylation and gene expression, which may also contribute to key agronomic traits in <i>P. vaginatum.</i>
