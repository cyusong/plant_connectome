Abscisic acid (ABA) is a major phytohormone that plays important roles in stress responses, including regulation of gene expression and stomatal closure. Regulation of gene expression by transcription factors is a key cellular process for initiating defense responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, using pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>) leaves, we identified the MYB transcription factor <i>CaDIM1</i> (<i>Capsicum annuum</i> Drought Induced MYB 1), which was highly induced by ABA and drought stress. CaDIM1 has an MYB domain in the N-terminal region and an acidic domain in the C-terminal region, which are responsible for recognition and transactivation of the target gene, respectively. Compared to control plants, <i>CaDIM1</i>-silenced pepper plants displayed ABA-insensitive and drought-sensitive phenotypes with reduced expression of stress-responsive genes. On the other hand, overexpression of <i>CaDIM1</i> in Arabidopsis exhibited the opposite phenotypes of <i>CaDIM1</i>-silenced pepper plants, accompanied by enhanced ABA sensitivity and drought tolerance. Taken together, we demonstrate that CaDIM1 functions as a positive regulator of the drought-stress response <i>via</i> modulating ABA-mediated gene expression.
