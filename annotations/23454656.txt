['23454656', 'CACTIN is a conserved eukaryotic protein without known functional domains.  Previous research revealed that CACTIN is essential in animals and protists and  that it may function in inflammation pathways in animals; however, these pathways  are not as broadly conserved as CACTIN. Therefore, the ancestral molecular  function of CACTIN remains unknown. Our studies using Arabidopsis show that  CACTIN is required for embryogenesis. Fluorescently tagged CACTIN localizes to  nuclear speckles and colocalizes with known splicing proteins. In  yeast-two-hybrid studies, we found that CACTIN binds to a putative component of  the spliceosome. These findings support a possible role for CACTIN in splicing.', '2013 Apr 2', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2013.02.041', 'Masson']
