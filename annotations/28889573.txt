Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a key enzyme in the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway of many of the world's worst weeds and a valuable target to develop C<sub>4</sub> plant-selective herbicides. By virtual screening, analog synthesis, and in vitro validation, we identified pyrazolidine-3,5-diones as a new class of small molecules with inhibitory potential down to the submicromolar range against C<sub>4</sub> PEPC and a selectivity factor of up to 16 over C<sub>3</sub> PEPC. No other biological activity has yet been reported for the best compound, (3-bromophenyl)-4-(3-hydroxybenzylidene)-pyrazolidine-3,5-dione. A systematic variation in the substituents allowed the derivation of a qualitative structure-activity relationship. These findings make this compound class highly interesting for further investigations toward generating potent, C<sub>4</sub> plant-selective herbicides with a low potential for unwanted effects.
