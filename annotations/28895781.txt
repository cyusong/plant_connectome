Exposure of intact Arabidopsis leaves to 40 ppm nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) in light resulted almost exclusively in nitration of PsbO1, PsbO2, and PsbP1 of photosystem II (PSII), with minor nitration of four non-PS II proteins, including peroxiredoxin II E, as reported previously. Our previous findings that light-triggered selective nitration of PsbO1 decreased oxygen evolution and that inhibition of photoelectric electron transport inhibited nitration of PsbO1 implied that the nitratable tyrosine residue of PsbO1 is redox-active. However, whether the nitratable tyrosine residues of PsbO2 and PsbP1 are redox-active is unknown. In this study, we determined the oxygen evolution and maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII in intact Arabidopsis leaves following exposure to 40 ppm NO<sub>2</sub> in light and found that these parameters were decreased to 60 and 70% of the non-exposed control, respectively. Because PsbO1, PsbO2, and PsbP1 accounted for > 80% of anti-3-nitrotyrosine antibody signal intensities, observed decreases in the oxygen evolution and maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII were mainly attributable to nitration of the tyrosine residues of these PSII proteins. Thus, it is postulated that nitratable tyrosine residues of PsbO2 and PsbP1 are redox-active, as in the case of PsbO1. A new hypothetical model is proposed.

PsbO1: !nitrated by! NO<sub>2</sub> 
PsbO1: !decreases! oxygen evolution 
PsbO2/PsbP1: !nitrated by! NO<sub>2</sub> 
PsbO2/PsbP1: !decrease! oxygen evolution and maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII
