Embryogenesis in cotton is a difficult task due its genome dependency. We used 3 cotton cultivars (Khandwa-2, G. Cot. 10, and BC-68–2) and Coker-312 as control for regeneration. Efficient somatic embryogenesis was induced in agronomically important Indian cotton cultivars, Khandwa-2 and G. Cot. 10. For callusing in all the cultivars, different media combinations were tried. Embryogenesis was initiated on a hormone-free MS medium (MSB). For embryo maturation and recovery excess of L-glutamine and l-asparagine were used. Khandwa-2 somatic embryos were successfully regenerated into plants. However, no plantlet was obtained in case of G. Cot. 10. Callus induction was also observed in BC-68–2 but there was no embryogenesis observed. The study indicated that the medium and genotype significantly effects embryogenesis. An efficient protocol is described here for regenerating plants via somatic embryogenesis in an elite Indian cotton cultivar Khandwa-2.
