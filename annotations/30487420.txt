Jasmonic acid (JA) carboxyl methyltransferase (JMT), a key enzyme in jasmonate-regulated plant responses, may be involved in plant defense and development by methylating JA to MeJA, thus influencing the concentrations of MeJA in plant. In this study, we isolated the <i>JMT</i> gene from <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i>, an important medicinal plant widely used to treat cardiovascular disease. We present a genetic manipulation strategy to enhance the production of phenolic acids by overexpresion <i>SmJMT</i> in <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i>. Global transcriptomic analysis using RNA sequencing showed that the expression levels of genes involved in the biosynthesis pathway of phenolic acids and MeJA were upregulated in the overexpression lines. In addition, the levels of endogenous MeJA, and the accumulation of rosmarinic acid (RA) and salvianolic acid (Sal B), as well as the concentrations of total phenolics and total flavonoids in transgenic lines, were significantly elevated compared with the untransformed control. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of <i>SmJMT</i> promotes the production of phenolic acids through simultaneously activating genes encoding key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis pathway of phenolic acids and enhancing the endogenous MeJA levels in <i>S. miltiorrhiza</i>.
