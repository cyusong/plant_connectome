Sphingolipids are fundamental lipids involved in various cellular, developmental and stress-response processes. As such, they orchestrate not only vital molecular mechanisms of living cells but also act in diseases, thus qualifying as potential pharmaceutical targets. Sphingolipids are universal to eukaryotes and are also present in some prokaryotes. Some sphingolipid structures are conserved between animals, plants and fungi, whereas others are found only in plants and fungi. In plants, the structural diversity of sphingolipids, as well as their downstream effectors and molecular and cellular mechanisms of action, are of tremendous interest to both basic and applied researchers, as about half of all small molecules in clinical use originate from plants. Here, we review recent advances towards a better understanding of the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, the diversity in their structures as well as their functional roles in membrane architecture, cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and cell polarity, and cell responses to environmental or developmental signals.
