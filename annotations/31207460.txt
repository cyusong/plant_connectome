Auxin is a well-known, crucial regulator of the entire plant lifecycle, not only orchestrating many aspects of plant growth and development, but also playing various roles in biotic and abiotic stress. This study reports the isolation and functional characterization of a DUF-966 domain-containing gene, At3g46110, re-named AtAuxRP3. AtAuxRP3 overexpression in Arabidopsis increased the levels of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid, enhanced expression of the auxin-responsive reporter DR5:GUS near the vegetative shoot apex, and led to ectopic activation of auxin signaling, including dysmorphic (narrow, asymmetric) rosette leaves, abnormal emergence of inflorescence, inhibition of primary root elongation and arrest of dark-grown hypocotyls. AtAuxRP3-OX lines also showed decreased tolerance to NaCl and osmotic stress during Arabidopsis seeds germination and young seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis showed AtAuxRP3-OX seedlings displayed increases in the expression of genes that group in a variety of developmental categories, while other downregulated genes were associated with stress responses. Our results provide evidence for a regulatory role of AtAuxRP3 in endogenous auxin levels, leaf development, and initiation of inflorescence stems early in reproductive development during Arabidopsis seedling growth.
