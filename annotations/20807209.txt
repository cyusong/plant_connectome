Arabinogalactan proteins are widely distributed in plant tissues and cells, and may function in the growth and development of higher plants. To our knowledge, there is currently no direct evidence concerning the involvement of fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (FLA) in sexual reproduction in Arabidopsis. In this study, Arabidopsis FLA3 was found to be specifically expressed in pollen grains and tubes. Subcellular localization showed that FLA3 anchors tightly to the plasma membrane, and its glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor may affect its localization. FLA3-RNA interference transgenic plants had approximately 50% abnormal pollen grains (including shrunken and wrinkled phenotypes) which lacked viability. Cytological observations revealed that pollen abortion occurred during the transition from uninucleate microspores to bicellular pollens, with abnormal cellulose distribution seen by calcofluor white staining. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the basic structure of the exine layer in aberrant pollen was normal, but the intine layer appeared to have some abnormalities. Taken together, these results suggest that FLA3 is involved in microspore development and may affect pollen intine formation, possibly by participating in cellulose deposition. In FLA3-overexpressing transgenic plants, defective elongation of the stamen filament and reduced female fertility led to short siliques with low seed set, which suggested that ectopic expression of FLA3 in tissues may reduce or disrupt cell growth and then result in defects throughout the plant.
