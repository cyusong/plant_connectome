Cold and drought stress considerably suppress the development of plants. In this study, a new MYB (v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral)TF gene, <i>MbMYBC1</i>, was isolated from the <i>M. baccata</i> and located in nucleus. <i>MbMYBC1</i> has a positive response to low temperature and drought stress. After being introduced into <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, the physiological indicators of transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> had corresponding changes under these two stresses, the activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased, electrolyte leakage rate (EL) and the content of proline increased, but the content of chlorophyll decreased. In addition, its overexpression can also activate the downstream expression of <i>AtDREB1A</i>, <i>AtCOR15a</i>, <i>AtERD10B</i> and <i>AtCOR47</i> related to cold stress and <i>AtSnRK2.4</i>, <i>AtRD29A</i>, <i>AtSOD1</i>and <i>AtP5CS1</i> related to drought stress. Based on these results, we speculate that <i>MbMYBC1</i> can respond to cold and hydropenia signals, and can be used in transgenic technology to improve plant tolerance to low temperature and drought stress.
