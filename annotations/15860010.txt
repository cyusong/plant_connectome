['15860010', 'The SKP1-Cullin/Cdc53-F-box protein ubiquitin ligases (SCF) target many important  regulatory proteins for degradation and play vital roles in diverse cellular  processes. In Arabidopsis there are 11 Cullin members (AtCUL). AtCUL1 was  demonstrated to assemble into SCF complexes containing COI1, an F-box protein  required for response to jasmonates (JA) that regulate plant fertility and  defense responses. It is not clear whether other Cullins also associate with COI1  to form SCF complexes, thus, it is unknown whether AtCUL1, or another Cullin that  assembles into SCF(COI1) (even perhaps two or more functionally redundant  Cullins), plays a major role in JA signaling. We present genetic and  physiological data to directly demonstrate that AtCUL1 is necessary for normal JA  responses. The homozygous AtCUL1 mutants axr6-1 and axr6-2, the heterozygous  mutants axr6/AXR6, and transgenic plants expressing mutant AtCUL1 proteins  containing a single amino acid substitution from phenylalanine-111 to valine, all  exhibit reduced responses to JA. We also demonstrate that ax6 enhances the effect  of coi1 on JA responses, implying a genetic interaction between COI1 and AtCUL1  in JA signaling. Furthermore, we show that the point mutations in AtCUL1 affect  the assembly of COI1 into SCF, thus attenuating SCF(COI1) formation.', '2005 May', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02394.x', 'Xie']
