Our findings suggest a new approach to pollen ontogenetic investigations, entailing consideration of physical factors, which enable a better understanding of exine developmental processes. The sporopollenin-containing part of the pollen wall-the exine-is one of the most complex cell walls in plants. By tracing each stage of microspore development in Larix decidua with TEM, we aimed to understand the underlying mechanisms of its exine establishment. Our hypothesis is that self-assembly interferes with exine development. Our specific aim is to generate experimental simulations of the exine developmental pattern. The sequence of events leading to exine development includes the appearance of spherical units in the periplasmic space, their rearrangement into radial columns, and the appearance of white-lined endexine lamellae. The final accumulation of sporopollenin proceeds in the post-tetrad period. The sequence of self-assembling micellar mesophases corresponds with that of the developmental events: spherical micelles; columns of spherical micelles; and laminate micelles separated by strata of water and visible as white-lined lamellae in TEM. Several patterns, simulating structures at different stages of exine development in Larix, were obtained from in vitro experiments. Purely physicochemical processes of self-assembly, which are not under direct genetic control, play an important role in exine development and share control with the genome. These findings suggest that a new approach to ontogenetic investigations, entailing consideration of physical factors (e.g., cell tensegrity), is required for a better understanding of developmental processes.
