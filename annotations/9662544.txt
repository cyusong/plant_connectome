['9662544', 'The CCAAT motif is found in the promoters of many eukaryotic genes. In yeast a  single complex of three proteins, termed HAP2, HAP3, and HAP5, binds to this  sequence, and in mammals the three components of the equivalent complex (called  variously NF-Y, CBF, or CP1) are also represented by single genes. Here we report  the presence of multiple genes for each of the components of the CCAAT-binding  complex, HAP2, 3,5, from Arabidopsis. Three independent Arabidopsis HAP subunit 2  (AtHAP2) cDNAs were cloned by functional complementation of a yeast hap2 mutant,  and two independent forms each of AtHAP3 and AtHAP5 cDNAs were detected in the  expressed sequence tag database. Additional homologs (two of AtHAP3 and one of  AtHAP5) have been identified from available Arabidopsis genomic sequences.  Northern-blot analysis indicated ubiquitous expression for each AtHAP2 and AtHAP5  cDNA in a range of tissues, whereas expression of each AtHAP3 cDNA was under  developmental and/or environmental regulation. The unexpected presence of  multiple forms of each HAP homolog in Arabidopsis, compared with the single genes  in yeast and vertebrates, suggests that the HAP2,3,5 complex may play diverse  roles in gene transcription in higher plants.', '1998 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.117.3.1015', 'Smith']
