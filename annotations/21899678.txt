['21899678', 'Although much is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in transporting  soluble proteins to the central vacuole, the mechanisms governing the trafficking  of membrane proteins remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the  mechanism involved in targeting the membrane protein, AtbetaFructosidase 4  (AtbetaFruct4), to the central vacuole in protoplasts. AtbetaFruct4 as a green  fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was transported as a membrane protein  during transit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Golgi apparatus  and the prevacuolar compartment (PVC). The N-terminal cytosolic domain of  AtbetaFruct4 was sufficient for transport from the ER to the central vacuole and  contained sequence motifs required for trafficking. The sequence motifs, LL and  PI, were found to be critical for ER exit, while the EEE and LCPYTRL sequence  motifs played roles in trafficking primarily from the trans Golgi network (TGN)  to the PVC and from the PVC to the central vacuole, respectively. In addition,  actin filaments and AtRabF2a, a Rab GTPase, played critical roles in vacuolar  trafficking at the TGN and PVC, respectively. On the basis of these results, we  propose that the vacuolar trafficking of AtbetaFruct4 depends on multiple sequence  motifs located at the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain that function as exit and/or  sorting signals in different stages during the trafficking process.', '2011 Dec', 'Traffic', '10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01276.x', 'Hwang']
