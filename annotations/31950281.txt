Our study demonstrated that the species respond non-linearly to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration when exposed to decadal changes in CO<sub>2</sub>, representing the year 1987, 2025, 2051, and 2070, respectively. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that the vast majority of C3 plants respond to elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> by decreasing their stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>). However, in the majority of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment studies, the response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> are tested between plants grown under ambient (380-420 ppm) and high (538-680 ppm) CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and measured usually at single time points in a diurnal cycle. We investigated g<sub>s</sub> responses to simulated decadal increments in CO<sub>2</sub> predicted over the next 4 decades and tested how measurements of g<sub>s</sub> may differ when two alternative sampling methods are employed (infrared gas analyzer [IRGA] vs. leaf porometer). We exposed Populus tremula, Popolus tremuloides and Sambucus racemosa to four different CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over 126 days in experimental growth chambers at 350, 420, 490 and 560 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>; representing the years 1987, 2025, 2051, and 2070, respectively (RCP4.5 scenario). Our study demonstrated that the species respond non-linearly to increases in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration when exposed to decadal changes in CO<sub>2</sub>. Under natural conditions, maximum operational g<sub>s</sub> is often reached in the late morning to early afternoon, with a mid-day depression around noon. However, we showed that the daily maximum g<sub>s</sub> can, in some species, shift later into the day when plants are exposed to only small increases (70 ppm) in CO<sub>2</sub>. A non-linear decreases in g<sub>s</sub> and a shifting diurnal stomatal behavior under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, could affect the long-term daily water and carbon budget of many plants in the future, and therefore alter soil-plant-atmospheric processes.
