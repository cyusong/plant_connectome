Mechanisms governing the polarization of plant cell division are poorly understood. Previously, we identified pangloss1 (PAN1) as a leucine-rich repeat-receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) that promotes the polarization of subsidiary mother cell (SMC) divisions toward the adjacent guard mother cell (GMC) during stomatal development in maize (Zea mays). Here, we identify pangloss2 (PAN2) as a second LRR-RLK promoting SMC polarization. Quantitative proteomic analysis identified a PAN2 candidate by its depletion from membranes of pan2 single and pan1;pan2 double mutants. Genetic mapping and sequencing of mutant alleles confirmed the identity of this protein as PAN2. Like PAN1, PAN2 has a catalytically inactive kinase domain and accumulates in SMCs at sites of GMC contact before nuclear polarization. The timing of polarized PAN1 and PAN2 localization is very similar, but PAN2 acts upstream because it is required for polarized accumulation of PAN1 but is independent of PAN1 for its own localization. We find no evidence that PAN2 recruits PAN1 to the GMC contact site via a direct or indirect physical interaction, but PAN2 interacts with itself. Together, these results place PAN2 at the top of a cascade of events promoting the polarization of SMC divisions, potentially functioning to perceive or amplify GMC-derived polarizing cues.
