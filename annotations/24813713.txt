There is increasing evidence confirming that dioecious plants have evolved a series of sex-related physiological mechanisms allowing acclimation to environmental stresses, but few studies have attempted to thoroughly uncover the potential molecular regulation underlying these responses. Recently, we found in the dioecious plant, Populus cathayana, that males possess a greater tolerance to enhanced UV-B radiation than do females. To continue this work further, comparative transcriptome analyses were carried out. A total of 362 and 296 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in males and females, respectively. Similarly, as shown in previous studies, these DEGs were involved in a set of conserved functions and pathways related to UV-B stress, regardless of the sex. On the other hand, sex-related responses via transcriptome remodeling were detected, as changes in sex-related gene expression occurred in some pathways. For example, many DEGs involved in amino acid metabolism were mainly upregulated in males but downregulated in females. In some pathways, DEGs were expressed predominantly or exclusively in one sex. This may directly contribute to sex-related physiological responses. Taken together, our results not only provide strong evidence that males and females have adopted sex-related molecular strategies in response to solar UV-B radiation but also suggest many new insights, in particular into molecular regulation, via sex-biased gene expression. We conclude that these results can further enhance the sustainable exploitation and management of P. cathayana plants.
