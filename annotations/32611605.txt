mRNA methylation at the <i>N6-</i>position of adenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) enables multiple layers of post-transcriptional gene control, often via RNA-binding proteins that use a YT521-B homology (YTH) domain for specific m<sup>6</sup>A recognition. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, normal leaf morphogenesis and rate of leaf formation require m<sup>6</sup>A and the YTH-domain proteins ECT2, ECT3 and ECT4. In this study, we show that <i>ect2/ect3</i> and <i>ect2/ect3/ect4</i> mutants also exhibit slow root and stem growth, slow flower formation, defective directionality of root growth, and aberrant flower and fruit morphology. In all cases, the m<sup>6</sup>A-binding site of ECT proteins is required for <i>in vivo</i> function. We also demonstrate that both m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase mutants and <i>ect2/ect3/ect4</i> exhibit aberrant floral phyllotaxis. Consistent with the delayed organogenesis phenotypes, we observe particularly high expression of <i>ECT2</i>, <i>ECT3</i> and <i>ECT4</i> in rapidly dividing cells of organ primordia. Accordingly, <i>ect2/ect3/ect4</i> mutants exhibit decreased rates of cell division in leaf and vascular primordia. Thus, the m<sup>6</sup>A-ECT2/ECT3/ECT4 axis is employed as a recurrent module to stimulate plant organogenesis, at least in part by enabling rapid cellular proliferation.
