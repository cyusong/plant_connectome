Plant genomes are so highly diverse that a substantial proportion of genomic sequences are not shared among individuals. The variable DNA sequences, along with the conserved core sequences, compose the more sophisticated pan-genome that represents the collection of all non-redundant DNA in a species. With rapid progress in genome sequencing technologies, pan-genome research in plants is now accelerating. Here we review recent advances in plant pan-genomics, including major driving forces of structural variations that constitute the variable sequences, methodological innovations for representing the pan-genome, and major successes in constructing plant pan-genomes. We also summarize recent efforts toward decoding the remaining dark matter in telomere-to-telomere or gapless plant genomes. These new genome resources, which have remarkable advantages over numerous previously assembled less-than-perfect genomes, are expected to become new references for genetic studies and plant breeding.
