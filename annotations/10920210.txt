['10920210', 'In a genetic screen of available T-DNA-mutagenized Arabidopsis populations for  loci potentially involved in phytochrome (phy) signaling, we identified a mutant  that displayed reduced seedling deetiolation under continuous red light, but  little if any change in responsiveness to continuous far-red light. This behavior  suggests disruption of phyB, but not phyA signaling. We have cloned the mutant  locus by using the T-DNA insertion and found that the disrupted gene is identical  to the recently described GIGANTEA (GI) gene identified as being involved in  control of flowering time. The encoded GI polypeptide has no sequence similarity  to any known proteins in the database. However, by using beta-glucuronidase-GI  and green fluorescent protein-GI fusion constructs, we have shown that GI is  constitutively targeted to the nucleus in transient transfection assays. Optical  sectioning by using the green fluorescent protein-GI fusion protein showed green  fluorescence throughout the nucleoplasm. Thus, contrary to previous  computer-based predictions that GI would be an integral plasma membrane-localized  polypeptide, the data here indicate that it is a nucleoplasmically localized  protein. This result is consistent with the proposed role in phyB signaling,  given recent evidence that early phy signaling events are nuclear localized.', '2000 Aug 15', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.170283997', 'Quail']
