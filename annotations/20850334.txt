['20850334', 'Among the three zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins, named  AtRZ-1a, AtRZ-1b, and AtRZ-1c, in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, AtRZ-1a has  previously been shown to enhance cold and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis.  Here, we determined and compared the functional roles of AtRZ-1b and AtRZ-1c in  Arabidopsis and Escherichia coli under cold stress conditions. AtRZ-1b, but not  AtRZ-1c, successfully complemented the cold sensitivity of E. coli BX04 mutant  cells lacking four cold shock proteins. Domain deletion and site-directed  mutagenesis showed that the zinc finger motif of AtRZ-1b is important for its  complementation ability, and that the truncated N- and C-terminal domains of  AtRZ-1b and AtRZ-1c harbor the complementation ability. Despite an increase in  transcript levels of AtRZ-1b and AtRZ-1c under cold stress, overexpression or  loss-of-function mutations did not affect seed germination or seedling growth of  Arabidopsis under cold stress conditions. AtRZ-1b and AtRZ-1c proteins, being  localized to the nucleus, have been shown to bind non-specifically to RNA  sequences in vitro, in comparison to AtRZ-1a that is localized to both the  nucleus and the cytoplasm and binds preferentially to G- or U-rich RNA sequences.  Taken together, these results demonstrate that the three AtRZ-1 family members  showing different cellular localization and characteristic nucleic acid-binding  property have a potential to contribute differently to the enhancement of cold  tolerance in Arabidopsis and E. coli.', '2010 Oct-Nov', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2010.08.013', 'Kang']
