['23903016', 'The local distribution of both the vacuolar-type proton ATPase (V-ATPase) and the  vacuolar-type proton pyrophosphatase (V-PPase), the main vacuolar proton pumps,  was investigated in intact vacuoles isolated from Arabidopsis suspension-cultured  cells. Fluorescent immunostaining showed that V-PPase was distributed evenly on  the vacuolar membrane (VM), but V-ATPase localized to specific regions of the VM.  We hypothesize that there may be membrane microdomains on the VM. To confirm this  hypothesis, we prepared detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) from the VM in  accordance with well established conventional methods. Analyses of fatty acid  composition suggested that DRMs had more saturated fatty acids compared with the  whole VM in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. In the proteomic  analyses of both DRMs and detergent-soluble mebranes (DSMs), we confirmed the  different local distributions of V-ATPase and V-PPase. The observations of DRMs  with an electron microscope supported the existence of different areas on the VM.  Moreover, it was observed using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy  (TIRFM) that proton pumps were frequently immobilized at specific sites on the  VM. In the proteomic analyses, we also found that many other vacuolar membrane  proteins are distributed differently in DRMs and DSMs. Based on the results of  this study, we discuss the possibility that VM microdomains might contribute to  vacuolar dynamics.', '2013 Oct', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pct107', 'Mimura']
