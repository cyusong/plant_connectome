Oxylipins are important oxygenated derivatives of fatty acids that regulate a variety of plant physiological and pathological processes in response to specific external challenges. A large body of evidence has indicated that algae can also produce a surprisingly diverse array of volatile oxylipins, yet little is known about the roles of volatile oxylipins as defense signals in macroalgae. In this study, the kelp Macrocystis pyrifera was treated by the oxylipin messenger 1-octen-3-ol and then a genome-wide gene expression profile and fatty acid spectrum analysis were performed. We found that M. pyrifera responded rapidly to the exposure of the oxylipin messenger 1-octen-3-ol. It regulated the expression levels of genes mainly involved in signal transduction, lipid metabolism, oxidation prevention, cell wall synthesis, photosynthesis, and development. Moreover, 1-octen-3-ol treatments decreased several types of total fatty acid contents and increased free fatty acid contents, especially for the C18 and C20 fatty acids. In addition, it decreased the content of indole-3-acetic acid, abscisic acid, and zeatin and increased the gibberellic acid content. Our findings demonstrated that 1-octen-3-ol is an available inducer for M. pyrifera, which is capable of rapidly upregulating kelp's defense response.
