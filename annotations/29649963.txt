Colletotrichum orchidophilum is a plant-pathogenic fungus infecting a wide range of plant species belonging to the family Orchidaceae. In addition to its economic impact, C. orchidophilum has been used in recent years in evolutionary studies because it represents the closest related species to the C. acutatum species complex. Here, we present the first-draft whole-genome sequence of C. orchidophilum IMI 309357, providing a resource for future research on anthracnose of Orchidaceae and other hosts.
