Ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) is one of the most popular medicinal herbs, and the root of this plant contains pharmacologically active components, called ginsenosides. Ginsenosides, a class of tetracyclic triterpene saponins, are synthesized from dammarenediol-II after hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) and then glycosylation by a glycosyltransferase. Protopanaxadiol synthase, which is a CYP enzyme (CYP716A47) that catalyzes the hydroxylation of dammarenediol-II at the C-12 position to yield protopanaxadiol, was recently characterized. Here, we isolated two additional CYP716A subfamily genes (CYP716A52v2 and CYP716A53v2) and determined that the gene product of CYP716A53v2 is a protopanaxadiol 6-hydroxylase that catalyzes the formation of protopanaxatriol from protopanaxadiol during ginsenoside biosynthesis in P. ginseng. Both CYP716A47 and CYP716A53v2 mRNAs accumulated ubiquitously in all organs of ginseng plants. In contrast, CYP716A52v2 mRNA accumulated only in the rhizome. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment resulted in the obvious accumulation of CYP716A47 mRNA in adventitious roots. However, neither CYP716A52v2 nor CYP716A53v2 mRNA was affected by MeJA treatment during the entire culture period. The ectopic expression of CYP716A53v2 in recombinant WAT21 yeast resulted in protopanaxatriol production after protopanaxadiol was added to the culture medium. In vitro enzymatic activity assays revealed that CYP716A53v2 catalyzed the oxidation of protopanaxadiol to produce protopanaxatriol. The chemical structures of the protopanaxatriol products were confirmed using liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (LC/APCIMS). Our results indicate that the gene product of CYP716A53v2 is a protopanaxadiol 6-hydroxylase that produces protopanaxatriol from protopanaxadiol, which is an important step in the formation of dammarane-type triterpene aglycones in ginseng saponin biosynthesis.
