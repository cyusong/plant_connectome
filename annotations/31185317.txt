The contents of eight phytohormones and the expression levels of genes encoding enzymes related to abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and deactivation/degradation and transcription factors (TFs) related to fruit ripening were studied in the non-climacteric strawberry fruit (Fragaria × ananassa Duch., cv. 'Seolhyang') at six developmental stages. The hormones tested were ABA, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid 4 (GA<sub>4</sub>), jasmonic acid (JA), methyljasmonate (MJ), jasmonoyl isoleucine (JA-Ile), salicylic acid (SA), and ethylene (ET). The developmental and ripening stages studied were small green (S1, 11 days post-anthesis, DPA), green (S2, 20 DPA), breaker (S3, 24 DPA), pink (S4, 27 DPA), red (S5, 31 DPA), and fully red (S6, 40 DPA). IAA and GA<sub>4</sub> contents were highest at S1 and gradually decreased after this stage. ABA content was low at S1-S3 and then increased rapidly until peaking at S6. By contrast, MJ content showed no significant changes over time, while SA content gradually increased. JA, JA-Ile, and ET contents were either insufficient for quantification or undetectable. Expression of the ABA biosynthesis genes FaNCED1 and FaABA2 increased during fruit ripening, whereas expression of the ABA deactivation/degradation genes FaUGT75C1 and FaCYP707A1 was high early in development, when ABA content was low, and then decreased. Among four ripening-related TF genes, FaMYB1, FaMYB5, FaMYB10, and FaASR, only the expression of FaMYB10 seemed to be closely related to strawberry fruit ripening. Our study supports the idea that ABA and FaMYB10 appear to be the key hormone and TF regulating strawberry ripening.

ABA: !synthesizes! FaNCED1, FaABA2
ABA: !deactivates/degrades! FaUGT75C1, FaCYP707A1
IAA, GA<sub>4</sub>: !decreases! over time
MJ: !remains constant! over time
SA: !increases! over time
JA, JA-Ile, ET: !insufficient/undetectable!
FaMYB10: !regulates! strawberry fruit ripening
