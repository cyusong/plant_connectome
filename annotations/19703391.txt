During post-embryonic development, plants undergo a series of phase transitions, from juvenile to adult and from the vegetative to the reproductive phase. Recent findings reported in Cell (Wang et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2009) and Developmental Cell (Yamaguchi et al., 2009) reveal how microRNAs and their transcription factor targets coordinate these phase transitions.
