The filamentous fungus <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> is a well-known cereal pathogen and <i>F. avenaceum</i> is a pathogen with a wide host range. Recently, both species were reported as causal agents of apple rot, raising concerns about postharvest yield losses and mycotoxin contamination. Here, we report genome assemblies of <i>F. avenaceum</i> KA13 and <i>F. graminearum</i> TaB10, both isolated from fruits with symptoms of apple rot. The final <i>F. avenaceum</i> KA13 genome sequence assembly of 41.7 Mb consists of 34 scaffolds, with an N<sub>50</sub> value of 2.2 Mb and 15,886 predicted genes. The total size of the final <i>F. graminearum</i> TaB10 assembly is 36.76 Mb, consisting of 54 scaffolds with an N<sub>50</sub> value of 1.7 Mb, and it consists of 14,132 predicted genes. These new genomes provide valuable resources to better understand plant-microbe interaction in stored apple rot disease. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
