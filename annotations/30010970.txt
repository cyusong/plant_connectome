High-throughput and accurate measurements of plant traits facilitate identification of gene function. Along with recent advances in quantitative genomics, there is a growing need for precise quantification of multiple traits in plants. However, it is difficult continuously to quantify plant adaptive responses to environmental stress responses such as drought because multiple environmental factors are intricately involved in the phenotype. To solve this problem, we developed an automatic phenotyping system for evaluating the growth responses of individual Arabidopsis plants to a wide range of environmental conditions. The RIKEN Integrated Plant Phenotyping System (RIPPS) controls soil moisture for single plants by automatically weighing and watering 120 continuously rotating pots under controlled light, humidity and temperature growth conditions. RIPPS also records individual rosette size and expansion rate by photographing plants every 2 h. We used RIPPS to establish phenotype evaluation methods for Arabidopsis growth response and water use efficiency under various water conditions, and analyzed the involvement of ABA metabolism in determining water use efficiency. We also used RIPPS to analyze salinity tolerance in Arabidopsis plants.
