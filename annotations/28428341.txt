['28428341', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 2 catalyzes the H3K27me3 modification that  warrants inheritance of a repressive chromatin structure during cell division,  thereby assuring stable target gene repression in differentiated cells. It is  still under investigation how H3K27me3 is passed on from maternal to filial  strands during DNA replication; however, cell division can reinforce H3K27me3  coverage at target regions. To identify novel factors involved in the Polycomb  pathway in plants, we performed a forward genetic screen for enhancers of the  like heterochromatin protein 1 (lhp1) mutant, which shows relatively mild  phenotypic alterations compared with other plant PRC mutants. We mapped enhancer  of lhp1 (eol) 1 to a gene related to yeast Chromosome transmission fidelity 4  (Ctf4) based on phylogenetic analysis, structural similarities, physical  interaction with the CMG helicase component SLD5, and an expression pattern  confined to actively dividing cells. A combination of eol1 with the curly leaf  (clf) allele, carrying a mutation in the catalytic core of PRC2, strongly  enhanced the clf phenotype; furthermore, H3K27me3 coverage at target genes was  strongly reduced in eol1 clf double mutants compared with clf single mutants.  EOL1 physically interacted with CLF, its partially redundant paralog SWINGER  (SWN), and LHP1. We propose that EOL1 interacts with LHP1-PRC2 complexes during  replication and thereby participates in maintaining the H3K27me3 mark at target  genes.', '2017 May 2', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1620955114', 'ORCID:']
