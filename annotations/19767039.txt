['19767039', 'The Arabidopsis genome contains 17 predicted beta-galactosidase genes, all of  which belong to glycosyl hydrolase (GH) Family 35. These genes have been further  grouped into seven subfamilies based on sequence similarity. The largest of  these, subfamily a1, consists of six genes, Gal-1 (At3g13750), Gal-2 (At3g52840),  Gal-3 (At4g36360), Gal-4 (At5g56870), Gal-5 (At1g45130), and Gal-12 (At4g26140),  some of which were characterized in previous studies. We report here the  purification and biochemical characterization of recombinant Gal-1, Gal-3, Gal-4  and Gal-12 from Pichiapastoris, completing the analysis of all six recombinant  proteins, as well as the isolation and characterization of the native Gal-2  protein from Arabidopsis leaves. Comparison of the relative expression levels of  the subfamily a1 beta-galactosidases at the mRNA and protein levels uncovered  evidence of differential regulation, which may involve post-transcriptional and  post-translational processes. In addition, this study provides further support  for the proposed function of the subfamily a1 beta-galactosidases in cell wall  modification based on analysis of the organ-specific expression and subcellular  localization of Gal-1 and Gal-12. Our study suggests that, despite some  differences in individual biochemical characteristics and expression patterns,  each member of the family has the potential to contribute to the dynamics of the  Arabidopsis plant cell wall.', '2009 Dec', 'Phytochemistry', '10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.08.008', 'Esen']
