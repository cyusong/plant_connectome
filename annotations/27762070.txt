We have identified hpm91, a Chlamydomonas mutant lacking Proton Gradient Regulation5 (PGR5) capable of producing hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub> ) for 25 days with more than 30-fold yield increase compared to wild type. Thus, hpm91 displays a higher capacity of H<sub>2</sub> production than a previously characterized pgr5 mutant. Physiological and biochemical characterization of hpm91 reveal that the prolonged H<sub>2</sub> production is due to enhanced stability of PSII, which correlates with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity during sulfur deprivation. This anti-ROS response appears to protect the photosynthetic electron transport chain from photo-oxidative damage and thereby ensures electron supply to the hydrogenase.
