['15632145', 'Peroxiredoxins (Prx) have recently moved into the focus of plant and animal  research in the context of development, adaptation, and disease, as they function  both in antioxidant defense by reducing a broad range of toxic peroxides and in  redox signaling relating to the adjustment of cell redox and antioxidant  metabolism. At-PrxII F is one of six type II Prx identified in the genome of  Arabidopsis thaliana and the only Prx that is targeted to the plant  mitochondrion. Therefore, it might be assumed to have functions similar to the  human 2-Cys Prx (PRDX3) and type II Prx (PRDX5) and yeast 1-Cys Prx that likewise  have mitochondrial localizations. This paper presents a characterization of PrxII  F at the level of subcellular distribution, activity, and reductive regeneration  by mitochondrial thioredoxin and glutaredoxin. By employing tDNA insertion  mutants of A. thaliana lacking expression of AtprxII F (KO-AtPrxII F), it is  shown that under optimal environmental conditions the absence of PrxII F is  almost fully compensated for, possibly by increases in activity of mitochondrial  ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione-dependent peroxidase. However, a stronger  inhibition of root growth in KO-AtPrxII F seedlings as compared with wild type is  observed under stress conditions induced by CdCl2 as well as after administration  of salicylhydroxamic acid, an inhibitor of cyanide-insensitive respiration.  Simultaneously, major changes in the abundance of both nuclear and  mitochondria-encoded transcripts were observed. These results assign a principal  role to PrxII F in antioxidant defense and possibly redox signaling in plants  cells.', '2005 Apr 1', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M413189200', 'Dietz']
