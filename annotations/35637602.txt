Invasive plants can change soil properties resulting in improved growth. Although invaders are known to alter soil chemistry, it remains unclear if chemicals secreted by roots facilitate invasive plant-soil mutualisms. With up to 19 confamilial pairs of invasive and native plants, and most of which were congeners, we explored the root exudate-induced changes in plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal mutualisms. We found that, relative to natives, invaders had greater AM colonization, greater biomass and their root exudates contained higher concentrations of two common chemical signals - quercetin and strigolactones - which are known to stimulate AM fungal growth and root colonization. An exudate exchange experiment showed that root exudates from invaders increased AM colonization more than exudates from natives. However, application of activated carbon led to greater reduction in AM colonization and plant biomass for invaders than natives, suggesting stronger effects of chemical signals in root exudates from invaders. We show that nonnative plants promote interactions with soil mutualists via enhancing root exudate chemicals, which could have important implications for invasion success.

Invaders: !enhance! AM colonization
Invaders: !contain higher concentrations of! quercetin and strigolactones
Exudates from Invaders: !increase! AM colonization
Activated carbon: !reduces! AM colonization and plant biomass for Invaders
