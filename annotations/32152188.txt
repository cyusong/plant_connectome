['32152188', 'Leaf senescence is tightly regulated by numerous internal cues and external  environmental signals. The process of leaf senescence is promoted by a low ratio  of red to far-red (R:FR) light, FR light, or extended darkness and is repressed  by a high ratio of R:FR light or R light. However, the precise regulatory  mechanisms by which plants assess external light signals and their internal cues  to initiate and control the process of leaf senescence remain largely unknown. In  this study, we discovered that the light-signaling protein FAR-RED ELONGATED  HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) negatively regulates age-induced and light-mediated leaf  senescence in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). FHY3 directly binds to the  promoter region of transcription factor gene WRKY28 to repress its expression,  thus negatively regulating salicylic acid biosynthesis and senescence. Both the  fhy3 loss-of-function mutant and WRKY28-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants  exhibited early senescence under high R:FR light conditions, indicating that the  FHY3-WRKY28 transcriptional module specifically prevents leaf senescence under  high R:FR light conditions. This study reveals the physiological and molecular  functions of FHY3 and WRKY28 in leaf senescence and provides insight into the  regulatory mechanism by which plants integrate dynamic environmental light  signals and internal cues to initiate and control leaf senescence.', '2020 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.20.00021', 'ORCID:']
