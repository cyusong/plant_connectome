Plant AT-rich sequences and zinc-binding proteins (PLATZ) play crucial roles in response to environmental stresses. Nevertheless, PLATZ gene family has not been systemically studied in Rosaceae species, such as in apple, pear, peach, or strawberry. In this study, a total of 134 PLATZ proteins were identified from nine Rosaceae genomes and were classified into seven phylogenetic groups. Subsequently, the chromosomal localization, duplication, and collinearity relationship for apple PLATZ genes were investigated, and segmental duplication is a major driving-force in the expansion of PLATZ in <i>Malus</i>. Expression profiles analysis showed that PLATZs had distinct expression patterns in different tissues, and multiple genes were significantly changed after drought and ABA treatments. Furthermore, the co-expression network combined with RNA-seq data showed that PLATZ might be involved in drought stress by regulating ABA signaling pathway. In summary, this study is the first in-depth and systematic identification of PLATZ gene family in Rosaceae species, especially for apple, and provided specific PLATZ gene resource for further functional research in response to abiotic stress.
