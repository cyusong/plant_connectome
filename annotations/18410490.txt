The regional abundance of C(4) grasses is strongly controlled by temperature, however, the role of precipitation is less clear. Progress in elucidating the direct effects of photosynthetic pathway on these climate relationships is hindered by the significant genetic divergence between major C(3) and C(4) grass lineages. We addressed this problem by examining seasonal climate responses of photosynthesis in Alloteropsis semialata, a unique grass species with both C(3) and C(4) subspecies. Experimental manipulation of rainfall in a common garden in South Africa tested the hypotheses that: (1) photosynthesis is greater in the C(4) than C(3) subspecies under high summer temperatures, but this pattern is reversed at low winter temperatures; and (2) the photosynthetic advantage of C(4) plants is enhanced during drought events. Measurements of leaf gas exchange over 2 years showed a significant photosynthetic advantage for the C(4) subspecies under irrigated conditions from spring through autumn. However, the C(4) leaves were killed by winter frost, while photosynthesis continued in the C(3) plants. Unexpectedly, the C(4) subspecies also lost its photosynthetic advantage during natural drought events, despite greater water-use efficiency under irrigated conditions. This study highlights previously unrecognized roles for climatic extremes in determining the ecological success of C(3) and C(4) grasses.
