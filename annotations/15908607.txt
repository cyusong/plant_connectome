['15908607', 'The organization and dynamics of microtubules are regulated by  microtubule-associated proteins, or MAPs. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana),  nine genes encode proteins of the evolutionarily conserved MAP65 family. We  proposed that different MAP65s might have distinct roles in the interaction with  microtubules. In this study, two AtMAP65 proteins, AtMAP65-1 and AtMAP65-6, were  chosen to test this hypothesis in vitro. Although both fusion proteins were able  to cosediment with microtubules in vitro, different properties on tubulin  polymerization and microtubule bundling were observed. AtMAP65-1 was able to  promote tubulin polymerization, enhance microtubule nucleation, and decrease the  critical concentration for tubulin polymerization. It also induced the formation  of large microtubule bundles by forming cross-bridges between microtubules evenly  along the whole length of microtubules. In the presence of AtMAP65-1, microtubule  bundles were more resistant to cold and dilution treatments. AtMAP65-6, however,  demonstrated no activity in promoting tubulin polymerization and stabilizing  preformed microtubules. AtMAP65-6 induced microtubules to form a mesh-like  network with individual microtubules. Cross-bridge-like interactions were only  found at regional sites between microtubules. The microtubule network induced by  AtMAP65-6 was more resistant to high concentration of NaCl than the bundles  induced by AtMAP65-1. Purified monospecific anti-AtMAP65-6 antibodies revealed  that AtMAP65-6 was associated with mitochondria in Arabidopsis cells. It was  concluded that these two MAP65 proteins were targeted to distinct sites, thus  performing distinct functions in Arabidopsis cells.', '2005 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.104.052456', 'Yuan']
