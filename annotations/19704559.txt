Cytokinin receptors (CRs) are hybrid-type histidine kinases, membrane proteins with a cytokinin-binding extracellular domain. CRs initiate and propagate cytokinin signaling by means of phosphorylation and phosphotransfer to downstream proteins. In legumes, some members of the CR multigenic family are essential for nodulation. In two recent works, we investigated the involvement of two new CRs, MsHK1 from Medicago sativa, and LaHK1 from Lupinus albus, in nodule morphogenesis, senescence and stress response. LaHK1 expression increased during the first stages of lupin nodule development, while MsHK1 expression was localized in the meristem and the invasion zone of alfalfa nodules pointing to a role for CRs in nodule cell proliferation and differentiation. Both CRs were also induced during nodule senescence. MsHK1 expression increased under osmotic stress and both genes were induced following dark stress, indicating that CRs are also likely to play a significant role in the response to stress. We propose multiple roles for CRs which, when analyzed jointly with recent results from other authors, suggest coordinated cross-talk of different signaling systems.
