['34817930', 'During the terminal stage of stomatal development, the R2R3-MYB transcription  factors FOUR LIPS (FLP/MYB124) and MYB88 limit guard mother cell division by  repressing the transcript levels of multiple cell-cycle genes. In Arabidopsis  thaliana possessing the weak allele flp-1, an extra guard mother cell division  results in two stomata having direct contact. Here, we identified an ethylmethane  sulfonate-mutagenized mutant, flp-1 xs01c, which exhibited more severe defects  than flp-1 alone, producing giant tumor-like cell clusters. XS01C, encoding F-BOX  STRESS-INDUCED 4 (FBS4), is preferentially expressed in epidermal stomatal  precursor cells. Overexpressing FBS4 rescued the defective stomatal phenotypes of  flp-1 xs01c and flp-1 mutants. The deletion or substitution of a conserved  residue (Proline166) within the F-box domain of FBS4 abolished or reduced,  respectively, its interaction with Arabidopsis Skp1-Like1 (ASK1), the core  subunit of the Skp1/Cullin/F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, the  FBS4 protein physically interacted with CYCA2;3 and induced its degradation  through the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway. Thus, in addition to the known  transcriptional pathway, the terminal symmetric division in stomatal development  is ensured at the post-translational level, such as through the ubiquitination of  target proteins recognized by the stomatal lineage F-box protein FBS4.', '2022 Jan', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/jipb.13193', 'ORCID:']
