Triacylglycerol (TAG) is a major storage reserve in many plant seeds. We previously identified a TAG lipase mutant called sugar-dependent1 (sdp1) that is impaired in TAG hydrolysis following Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed germination (Eastmond, 2006). The aim of this study was to identify additional lipases that account for the residual TAG hydrolysis observed in sdp1. Mutants were isolated in three candidate genes (SDP1-LIKE [SDP1L], ADIPOSE TRIGLYCERIDE LIPASE-LIKE, and COMPARATIVE GENE IDENTIFIER-58-LIKE). Analysis of double, triple, and quadruple mutants showed that SDP1L is responsible for virtually all of the residual TAG hydrolysis present in sdp1 seedlings. Oil body membranes purified from sdp1 sdp1L seedlings were deficient in TAG lipase activity but could still hydrolyze di- and monoacylglycerol. SDP1L is expressed less strongly than SDP1 in seedlings. However, SDP1L could partially rescue TAG breakdown in sdp1 seedlings when expressed under the control of the SDP1 or 35S promoters and in vitro assays showed that both SDP1 and SDP1L can hydrolyze TAG, in preference to diacylglycerol or monoacylglycerol. Seed germination was slowed in sdp1 sdp1L and postgerminative seedling growth was severely retarded. The frequency of seedling establishment was also reduced, but sdp1 sdp1L was not seedling lethal under normal laboratory growth conditions. Our data show that together SDP1 and SDP1L account for at least 95% of the rate of TAG hydrolysis in Arabidopsis seeds, and that this hydrolysis is important but not essential for seed germination or seedling establishment.
