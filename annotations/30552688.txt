Agricultural activities are affected by many biotic and abiotic stresses associated with global climate change. Predicting the response of plants to abiotic stress under future climate scenarios requires an understanding of plant biochemical performance in simulated stress conditions. In this study, the antioxidant response of Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Mombaça exposed to warming (+2°C above ambient temperature) (eT), water deficit (wS) and the combination eT + wS was analysed under field conditions using a temperature free-air-controlled enhancement facility. Warming was applied during the entire growth period. Data were collected at 13, 19 and 37 days after the start of the water deficit treatment (DAT) and at two sampling times (6:00 and 12:00 h). A significant decrease in chlorophyll was observed under the wS treatment, but an increment in total chlorophyll was observed in eT + wS, particularly at 19 DAT. Significant increase in H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> content, malondialdehyde and protein oxidation was observed in the wS treatment at noon of the third sampling. In the combined wS + eT stress treatment, the activity of the enzymatic antioxidant system increased, particularly of superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX; EC 1.11.1.11). The chlorophyll fluorescence images showed that the photochemical performance was not significantly affected by the treatments. In conclusion, under simulated future warming and water stress conditions, the photosystem II (PSII) activity of P. maximum acclimated to moderate warming and a water-stressed environment associated with a relatively favourable antioxidant response, particularly in the activity of APX and SOD.
