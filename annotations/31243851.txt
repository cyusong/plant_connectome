Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a major staple food crop for over half of the world's population. As a crop species originated from the subtropics, rice production is hampered by chilling stress. The genetic mechanisms of rice responses to chilling stress have attracted much attention, focusing on chilling-related gene mining and functional analyses. Plants have evolved sophisticated regulatory systems to respond to chilling stress in coordination with light signaling pathway and internal circadian clock. However, in rice, information about light-signaling pathways and circadian clock regulation and their roles in chilling tolerance remains elusive. Further investigation into the regulatory network of chilling tolerance in rice is needed, as knowledge of the interaction between temperature, light, and circadian clock dynamics is limited. Here, based on phenotypic analysis of transgenic and mutant rice lines, we delineate the relevant genes with important regulatory roles in chilling tolerance. In addition, we discuss the potential coordination mechanism among temperature, light, and circadian clock in regulating chilling response and tolerance of rice, and provide perspectives for the ongoing chilling signaling network research in rice.
