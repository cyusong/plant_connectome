Proteins are modular functionalities regulating multiple cellular activities in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. As a consequence of higher plants adapting to arid and thermal conditions, C4 photosynthesis is the carbon fixation process involving multi-enzymes working in a coordinated fashion. However, how these enzymes interact with each other and whether they co-evolve in parallel to maintain interactions in different plants remain elusive to date. Here, we report our findings on the global protein co-evolution relationship and local dynamics of co-varying site shifts in key C4 photosynthetic enzymes. We found that in most of the selected key C4 photosynthetic enzymes, global pairwise co-evolution events exist to form functional couplings. Besides, protein-protein interactions between these enzymes may suggest their unknown functionalities in the carbon delivery process. For PEPC and PPCK regulation pairs, pocket formation at the interactive interface are not necessary for their function. This feature is distinct from another well-known regulation pair in C4 photosynthesis, namely, PPDK and PPDK-RP, where the pockets are necessary. Our findings facilitate the discovery of novel protein regulation types and contribute to expanding our knowledge about C4 photosynthesis.
