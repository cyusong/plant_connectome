High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms are capable of monitoring the phenotypic variation of plants through multiple types of sensors, such as red green and blue (RGB) cameras, hyperspectral sensors, and computed tomography, which can be associated with environmental and genotypic data. Because of the wide range of information provided, HTP datasets represent a valuable asset to characterize crop phenotypes. As HTP becomes widely employed with more tools and data being released, it is important that researchers are aware of these resources and how they can be applied to accelerate crop improvement. Researchers may exploit these datasets either for phenotype comparison or employ them as a benchmark to assess tool performance and to support the development of tools that are better at generalizing between different crops and environments. In this review, we describe the use of image-based HTP for yield prediction, root phenotyping, development of climate-resilient crops, detecting pathogen and pest infestation, and quantitative trait measurement. We emphasize the need for researchers to share phenotypic data, and offer a comprehensive list of available datasets to assist crop breeders and tool developers to leverage these resources in order to accelerate crop breeding.
