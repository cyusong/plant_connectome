In plants, as in animals, recent work has established that many developmental and defence response pathways are regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligases which control the level or the activity of key proteins through ubiquitination. Nodule formation is a tightly regulated process that integrates specific signal exchange and the coordinated activation of developmental mechanisms to synchronize bacterial infection and organ development. In the last decade, the characterization of several E3 ubiquitin ligase with roles during nodulation has been reported. These are mainly RING-finger and U-Box proteins involved either in nodule organogenesis or in the infection process. In this review, we summarize the knowledge in this field and conclude that the major challenge will be the identification of the regulation and targets of these E3 ubiquitin ligases.

E3 ubiquitin ligase: !regulates! Developmental and defence response pathways
E3 ubiquitin ligase: !controls! Level or activity of key proteins
RING-finger/U-Box proteins: !involved in! Nodule organogenesis/infection process
