['22231402', 'Chromodomains typically recruit protein complexes to chromatin and read the  epigenetic histone code by recognizing lysine methylation in histone tails. We  report the crystal structure of the chloroplast signal recognition particle  (cpSRP) core from Arabidopsis thaliana, with the cpSRP54 tail comprising an  arginine-rich motif bound to the second chromodomain of cpSRP43. A twinned  aromatic cage reads out two neighboring nonmethylated arginines and adapts  chromodomains to a non-nuclear function in post-translational targeting.', '2012 Jan 8', 'Nat Struct Mol Biol', '10.1038/nsmb.2196', 'Sinning']
