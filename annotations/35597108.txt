The present study aimed to determine whether glyphosate-induced oxidative stress is directly related to the action mechanism of this herbicide (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase or EPSPS inhibition) and analyse the role of oxidative stress in glyphosate toxicity of the weed Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats. Two kinds of populations were studied using EPSPS amplification: glyphosate-sensitive and glyphosate-resistant (by gene amplification). Plants were grown hydroponically and treated with different glyphosate doses, after which several oxidative stress markers were measured in the leaves. Untreated, sensitive and resistant plants showed similar values for the analysed parameters. Treated glyphosate-sensitive plants showed an increase in shikimate, superoxide and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents and dose-dependent lipid peroxidation and antioxidant responses; however, none of these effects were observed in resistant plants, indicating that glyphosate-induced oxidative stress is related to EPSPS inhibition. Oxidative stress is associated with an increase in the activity of peroxidases due to EPSPS inhibition, although the link between both processes remains elusive. The fact that some glyphosate doses were lethal but did not induce major oxidative damage provides evidence that glyphosate toxicity is independent of oxidative stress.

EPSPS: !inhibits! glyphosate
Glyphosate: !induces! oxidative stress
Oxidative stress: !increases! peroxidase activity
Peroxidase: !associated with! EPSPS inhibition
Glyphosate: !lethal without! major oxidative damage
