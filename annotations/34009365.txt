Melatonin has been characterized as a growth regulator in plants. Melatonin shares tryptophan as the precursor with the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), but the interplay between melatonin and IAA remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to dissect the relationship between melatonin and IAA in regulating Arabidopsis primary root growth. We observed that melatonin concentrations ranging from 10-9 to 10-6 M functioned as IAA mimics to promote primary root growth in Arabidopsis wild type, as well as in pin-formed (pin) single and double mutants. Transcriptome analysis showed that changes in gene expression after melatonin and IAA treatment were moderately correlated. Most of the IAA-regulated genes were co-regulated by melatonin, indicating that melatonin and IAA regulated a similar subset of genes. Melatonin partially rescued primary root growth defects in pin single and double mutant plants. However, melatonin treatment had little effect on primary root growth in the presence of high concentrations of auxin biosynthesis inhibitors, or polar transport inhibitor, and could not rescue the root length defect of the IAA biosynthesis quintuple mutant yucQ. Therefore, we propose that melatonin promotes primary root growth in an IAA-dependent manner.
