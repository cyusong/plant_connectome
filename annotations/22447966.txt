['22447966', 'ABC1 (activity of bc1 complex) is a newly discovered atypical kinase in plants.  Here, it is reported that an ABC1 protein kinase-encoded gene, AtACDO1 (ABC1-like  kinase related to chlorophyll degradation and oxidative stress), located in  chloroplasts, was up-regulated by methyl viologen (MV) treatment. AtACDO1 RNAi  (RNA interference) plants showed developmental defects, including yellow-green  leaves and reduced contents of carotenoids and chlorophyll; the chlorophyll  reduction was associated with a change in the numbers of chlorophyll-binding  proteins of the photosynthetic complexes. Chlorophyllide (Chlide) a the first  product of chlorophyll degradation, and pheophorbide a, a subsequent intermediate  of Chlide a degradation, were increased in AtACDO1 RNAi plants. The AtACDO1 RNAi  plants were more sensitive to high light and MV than wild-type plants. The  AtACDO1 RNAi plants had lower transcript levels of the oxidative stress response  genes FSD1, CSD1, CAT1, and UTG71C1 after MV treatment compared with wild-type or  35S::AtACDO1 plants. Taken together, the results suggest that the chloroplast  AtACDO1 protein plays important roles in mediating chlorophyll degradation and  maintaining the number of chlorophyll-binding photosynthetic thylakoid membranes,  as well as in the photooxidative stress response.', '2012 Jun', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/ers072', 'Yang']
