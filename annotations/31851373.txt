During maize production, drought throughout the flowering stage usually induces seed abortion and yield losses. The influence of postpollination drought stress on seed abortion and its underlying mechanisms are not well characterized. By intervening in the competition for assimilates between kernel siblings under different degrees of postpollination drought stresses accompanied by synchronous pollination (SP) and incomplete pollination (ICP) approaches, the mechanisms of postpollination abortion were investigated at physiological and molecular levels. Upon SP treatment, up to 15% of the fertilized apical kernels were aborted in the drought-exacerbated competition for assimilates. The aborted kernels exhibited weak sucrose hydrolysis and starch synthesis but promoted the synthesis of trehalose-6-phosphate and ethylene. In ICP where basal pollination was prevented, apical kernel growth was restored with reinstated sucrose metabolism and starch synthesis and promoted sucrose and hexose levels under drought stress. In addition, the equilibrium between ethylene and polyamine in response to the drought and pollination treatments was associated with the abortion process. We conclude that competition for assimilates drives postpollination kernel abortion, whereas differences in sugar metabolism and the equilibrium between ethylene and polyamines may be relevant to the "live or die" choice of kernel siblings during this competition.
