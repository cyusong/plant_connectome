Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook., an evergreen conifer distributed in southern China, has been recognized as the most commercially important timber species due to its rapid growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying growth alternation due to vascular cambium activity are poorly understood. Here, we used cryosectioning to isolate the vascular cambium tissue of C. lanceolata at three stages, namely, juvenile, transition and mature (3-, 13-, and 35-year-old trees respectively) for transcriptome-wide analysis. Through assembling and annotation of transcripts, 108,767 unigenes and some potential growth-regulated genes were identified. A total of 5213, 4873 and 2541 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the three stages. DEGs related to cambial activity, cell division and cell wall modification were detected at various developmental stages of the vascular cambium. In addition, some putative genes involved in plant hormone biosynthesis were also differentially regulated. These results indicate that various cambium-related molecular activities result in alterations in the growth of C. lanceolata, particularly during the transition from juvenile to mature stages. The findings of the present study improve our understanding of cambium development and may aid in studies of the molecular mechanisms of wood production and provide fundamental insights into the establishment of the optimal rotation period for silvicultural trees.
