['15448264', 'Photosynthetic organisms must achieve a delicate balance between the light energy  absorbed by chlorophyll and their capacity to channel that energy into productive  photochemical reactions. Release of excess absorbed energy in the cell can cause  lethal photooxidative damage. We identified a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)  transcription factor, designated PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (PIF1), that  negatively regulates chlorophyll biosynthesis. pif1 mutant seedlings accumulate  excess free protochlorophyllide when grown in the dark, with consequent lethal  bleaching upon exposure to light. PIF1 interacts specifically with the  photoactivated conformer of phytochromes A and B, suggesting a signaling pathway  by which chlorophyll biosynthetic rates are tightly controlled during the  critical initial emergence of seedlings from subterranean darkness into sunlight.', '2004 Sep 24', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1099728', 'Quail']
