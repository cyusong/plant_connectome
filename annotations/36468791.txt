['36468791', "The Arabidopsis thaliana genome harbors more than 450 nuclear genes encoding  pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins that operate in the RNA metabolism of  mitochondria and/or plastids. To date, the molecular function of many PPR  proteins is still unknown. Here we analyzed the nucleus-encoded gene At4g19440  coding for a P-type PPR protein. Knockout of this gene interferes with normal  embryo development and seed maturation. Two experimental approaches were applied  to overcome lethality and to investigate the outcome of At4g19440 knockout in  adult plants. These studies revealed changes in the abundance of several  mitochondria-encoded transcripts. In particular, steady-state levels of  dicistronic rpl5-cob RNAs were markedly reduced, whereas levels of mature ccmC  and rpl2-mttB transcripts were clearly increased. Predictions according to the  one repeat to one nucleotide code for PPR proteins indicate binding of the  At4g19440 protein to a previously detected small RNA at the 3' termini of the  dicistronic rpl5-cob transcripts. This potential interaction indicates a function  of this protein in 3' end formation and stabilization of these RNA species,  whereas the increase in the levels of the ccmC mRNA along with other  mitochondria-encoded RNAs seems to be a secondary effect of At4g19440 knockout.  Since the inactivation of At4g19440 influences the stability of several  mitochondrial RNAs we call this gene MITOCHONDRIAL TRANSCRIPT STABILITY FACTOR 4  (MTSF4). This factor will be an interesting subject to study opposing effects of  a single nucleus-encoded protein on mitochondrial transcript levels.", '2023 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.16053', 'ORCID:']
