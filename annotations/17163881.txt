['17163881', 'Green-leaf volatiles are commonly emitted from mechanically and herbivore-damaged  plants. Derived from the lipoxygenase pathway, these compounds may serve as  attractants to predators and parasitoids of herbivores, prevent the spread of  bacteria and fungi, and induce several important plant defense pathways. In  Arabidopsis thaliana, the major volatile released upon mechanical wounding of the  leaves is the GLV ester, (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate. We have characterized a member  of the BAHD acyltransferase gene family At3g03480 which catalyzes the formation  of (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate from acetyl-CoA and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol. The encoded  acetyl CoA:(Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetyltransferase (CHAT) has the ability to accept  several medium-chain-length aliphatic and benzyl-derived alcohols, but has  highest catalytic efficiency with (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol. The highest expression of  CHAT occurs in the leaves and stems. Upon mechanical damage, the (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl  acetate emission peaked after 5 min and declined to pre-damage levels after 90  min. However, CHAT gene transcript levels increased much more slowly with the  highest levels detected between 3 and 6 h after wounding. An increase in CHAT  enzyme activity in vitro followed the transcript increase, with levels peaking  between 10 and 12 h after wounding. Plants expressing either an RNAi cassette for  the CHAT gene or plants harboring a T-DNA insertion in the CHAT coding region had  greatly reduced (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate emission, showing that the CHAT enzyme  is responsible for the in planta production of this ester.', '2007 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02946.x', 'Gershenzon']
