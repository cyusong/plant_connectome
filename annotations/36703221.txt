How mitochondria regulate the expression of their genes is poorly understood, partly because methods have not been developed for stably transforming mitochondrial genomes. In recent years, the disruption of mitochondrial genes has been achieved in several plant species using mitochondria-localized TALEN (mitoTALEN). In this study, we attempted to disrupt the NADH dehydrogenase subunit7 (NAD7) gene, a subunit of respiratory chain complex I, in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) using the mitoTALEN method. In some of the transformants, disruption of NAD7 was accompanied by severe growth inhibition and lethality, suggesting that NAD7 has an essential function in Arabidopsis. In addition, the mitochondrial genome copy number and overall expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins were generally increased by nad7 knockout. Similar increases were also observed in mutants with decreased NAD7 transcripts and with dysfunctions of other mitochondrial respiratory complexes. In these mutants, the expression of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial translation or protein transport was induced in sync with mitochondrial genes. Mitochondrial genome copy number was also partly regulated by the nuclear stress-responsive factors NAC domain containing protein 17 and Radical cell death 1. These findings suggest the existence of overall gene-expression control through mitochondrial genome copy number in Arabidopsis and that disruption of single mitochondrial genes can have additional broad consequences in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.
