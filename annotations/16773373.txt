Fast and slow chlorophyll fluorescence induction curves at high and low actinic visible light, post-illumination changes in fluorescence yield and reflectance changes at 820 nm induced by far-red light were used to characterize the state of PSII and PSI and their electron transport capabilities in chlorophyllous twig cortices of Eleagnus angustifolius L., while corresponding leaves served as controls. Twigs displayed low dark-adapted PSII photochemical efficiencies and particularly low linear electron transport rates when illuminated. In addition, their PSII population was characterized by a high proportion of inactive, non-Q(B)-reducing centers and an incomplete quenching of fluorescence during the slow induction phase. It is suggested that PSII in twigs is an inefficient electron donor to PSI and/or the reductive pentose phosphate cycle. Yet, in spite of this apparent PSII deficiency, pools of intermediate electron carriers and potential PSI activity were more than sufficient to support the observed linear electron transport rates. Moreover, the rate of PSI reduction upon far-red/dark transitions and the magnitude of fluorescence yield increase upon white light/dark transitions were compatible with an efficient electron flow to PSI from stromal donors in the absence of PSII activity. We conclude that corticular chlorenchyma may be actively engaged in cyclic at the expense of a linear electron flow and discuss the possible physiological significance of this finding in conjunction with the particular microenvironmental conditions encountered within twigs.
