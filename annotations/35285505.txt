['35285505', 'Recent findings have revealed the important roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the  secondary responses to oxidative damage caused by iron (Fe) excess. However, the  functional importance of miRNAs in plant responses to Fe deficiency remains to be  explored. Here, we show that the expression level of miR164 in Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots was repressed by Fe deficiency. Primary root length,  lateral root number, ferric reductase activity, and mRNA abundance of  IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER1 (IRT1) and FERRIC REDUCTION OXIDASE2 (FRO2) were  higher in the mir164b mutant than in the wild-type (WT) under Fe-deficient  conditions. Analysis of the Fe concentrations and ferric reductase activities in  the roots of miR164 knockdown transgenic plants showed that members of the miR164  family had different functions in Fe-deficiency responses. Promoter::GUS analysis  showed that NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) domain transcription factor5 (NAC5) is regulated  at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels under Fe-deficient  conditions. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing NAC5 were more tolerant  of Fe deficiency than the WT. NAC5 has transactivation activity and directly  transactivates the expression of Nuclear Factor Y, Subunit A8 (NFYA8), as  demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative polymerase  chain reaction, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and dual-luciferase  reporter assay. Like overexpression of NAC5, overexpression of NFYA8 increases  primary root length, lateral root number, ferric reductase activity, and mRNA  abundance of IRT1 and FRO2 under Fe-deficient conditions. Thus, MIR164b is  important for Fe-deficiency responses by its regulation of the NAC5-NFYA8 module.', '2022 Jun 1', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1093/plphys/kiac114', 'ORCID:']
