Auxin regulates plant growth and tropism responses. As a phytohormone, auxin is transported between its synthesis sites and action sites. Most natural auxin moves between cells <i>via</i> a polar transport system that is mediated by PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin exporters. The asymmetrically localized PINs usually determine the directionality of intercellular auxin flow. Different internal cues and external stimuli modulate PIN polar distribution and activity at multiple levels, including transcription, protein stability, subcellular trafficking, and post-translational modification, and thereby regulate auxin-distribution-dependent development. Thus, the different regulation levels of PIN polarity constitute a complex network. For example, the post-translational modification of PINs can affect the subcellular trafficking of PINs. In this review, we focus on subcellular trafficking and post-translational modification of PINs to summarize recent progress in understanding PIN polarity.
