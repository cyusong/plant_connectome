Oxylipins derived from lipoxygenase (LOX) activity play important roles in plant growth, development and stress response. In a recent study, we provided evidence that infestation of Arabidopsis thaliana foliage by the green peach aphid (GPA; Myzus persicae), a phloem sap-consuming insect, was promoted by plant LOX5-derived oxylipins. In comparison to the wild-type (WT) plant, GPA population was smaller on the Arabidopsis lox5 mutant. The insect spent less time feeding from the sieve element and xylem of the lox5 mutant compared with the WT plant. In addition, compared with insects feeding on the WT plant, when on the lox5 mutant, the GPA was unable to suppress an antibiotic activity that is present in Arabidopsis vascular sap. Roots are the critical source of a LOX5-derived oxylipin(s) that promotes colonization of the foliage by GPA. Here we show that the 9-hydoxy-10E, 12Z-octadecadienoic acid (9-HOD), a LOX5-derived oxylipin, accumulated in GPA that were reared on the WT, but not the lox5 mutant plant. However, 9-HOD accumulated in insects reared on lox5 mutant plants that were irrigated with 9-HOD, thus indicating that the insect ingests oxylipins from the host plant. We further demonstrate that the host plant requires LOX5 function to promote expression of the defense regulatory gene PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT4 in the foliage. Taken together, our previous observations and results presented here indicate that while the host plant utilizes LOX5-dependent factors for promoting defense mechanisms, GPA has evolved to utilize plant 9-LOX-derived oxylipins as cues to facilitate infestation, thus suggesting a complex involvement of oxylipins in Arabidopsis interaction with GPA.
