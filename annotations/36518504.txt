Chitin is a well-known elicitor of disease resistance and its recognition by plants is crucial to perceive fungal infections. Chitin can induce both a local immune response and a systemic disease resistance when provided as a supplement in soils. Unlike local immune responses, it is poorly explored how chitin-induced systemic disease resistance is developed. In this study, we report the systemic induction of disease resistance against the fungal pathogen <i>Bipolaris oryzae</i> by chitin supplementation of soils in rice. The transcriptome analysis uncovered genes related to cell-wall biogenesis, cytokinin signaling, regulation of phosphorylation, and defence priming in the development of chitin-induced systemic response. Alterations of cell-wall composition were observed in leaves of rice plants grown in chitin-supplemented soils, and the disease resistance against <i>B. oryzae</i> was increased in rice leaves treated with a cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor. The disruption of genes for lysin motif (LysM)-containing chitin receptors, OsCERK1 (Chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1) and OsCEBiP (Chitin elicitor-binding protein), compromised chitin-induced systemic disease resistance against <i>B. oryzae</i> and differential expression of chitin-induced genes found in wild-type rice plants. These findings suggest that chitin-induced systemic disease resistance in rice is caused by a perturbation of cell-wall biogenesis in leaves through long-distance signalling after local recognition of chitins by OsCERK1 and OsCEBiP.
