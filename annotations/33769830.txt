<i>Nigrospora oryzae</i> is an important phytopathogenic fungus with a broad host range. Here, we report an annotated draft of the genome of <i>N. oryzae</i> field strain GZL1 collected from maize assembled from PacBio and Illumina sequencing reads. The assembly we obtained has 15 scaffolds with an N<sub>50</sub> length of 4,037,616 bp. The resulting GZL1 draft genome is 43,214,190 bp, with GC content of 58.19%. The completeness of GZL1 genome assembly is 99.30%. This study is the first report of the genome sequence of <i>N. oryzae</i>, which can facilitate future study of the genetic variation and pathogenic mechanism of this important fungal pathogen.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
