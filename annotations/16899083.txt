Allene oxide synthase (AOS) enzymes are members of the cytochrome P450 enzyme family, sub-family CYP74. Here we describe the isolation of three cDNAs encoding AOS from potato (StAOS1-3). Based on sequence comparisons, they represent members of either the CYP74A (StAOS1 and 2) or the CYP74C (StAOS3) sub-families. StAOS3 is distinguished from the other two AOS isoforms in potato by its high substrate specificity for 9-hydroperoxides of linoleic and linolenic acid, compared with 13-hydroperoxides, which are only poor substrates. The highest activity was shown with (9S,10E,12Z)-9-hydroperoxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (9-HPODE) as a substrate. This hydroperoxide was metabolized in vitro to alpha- and gamma-ketols as well as to the cyclopentenone compound 10-oxo-11-phytoenoic acid. They represent hydrolysis products of the initial StAOS3 product 9,10-epoxyoctadecadienoic acid, an unstable allene oxide. By RNA gel hybridization blot analysis, StAOS3 was shown to be expressed in sprouting eyes, stolons, tubers and roots, but not in leaves. StAOS3 protein was found in all organs tested, but mainly in stems, stolons, sprouting eyes and tubers. As in vivo reaction products, the alpha-ketols derived from 9-hydroperoxides of linoleic and linolenic acid were only found in roots, tubers and sprouting eyes. Immunolocalization showed that StAOS3 was associated with amyloplasts and leucoplasts.
