Amino acid metabolism lies at the crossroad between nitrogen assimilation, carbon fixation and secondary metabolism. Because of this central position in plant metabolism, amino acid metabolism is tightly regulated by numerous factors to match both demand from the organs and availability of reduced carbon and inorganic nitrogen. While the amino acid biosynthesis enzymes have been shown to be regulated at the transcriptional and protein levels, the genes involved in amino acid sensing, signal transduction and regulation have not yet been identified. The overexpression of Glutamine Dumper1 leads to a large increase in the amino acid content of the plant and, as we show here, to insensitivity to externally applied amino acids. This phenotype is reminiscent of that of the pig1-1 mutant proposed to display a deregulated metabolism. These data suggest that GDU1 is involved in the regulation of amino acid metabolism and transport. As published previously, the analysis of deletion mutants proves that GDU1's VIMAG domain is important for the function of the protein. The present data show furthermore that other regions participate to this function.
