Grain yield and mineral nutrient concentration in cereal crops are usually inversely correlated, undermining biofortification efforts. Here, sink size, expressed as kernel number per cob, was manipulated by controlling the time when the silks of sweetcorn (Zea mays) cv. Hybrix 5 and var. HiZeax 103146 were exposed to pollen. Twelve other varieties were manually pollinated to achieve the maximum potential kernel number per cob, and kernel Zn concentration was correlated with kernel number and kernel mass. As kernel number increased, kernel Zn concentration decreased, with the decrease occurring to similar extents in the embryo tissue and the rest of the kernel. However, total kernel Zn accumulated per cob increased with increasing kernel number, as the small decreases in individual kernel Zn concentration were more than offset by increases in kernel number. When both kernel number and mass were considered, 90% of the variation in kernel Zn concentration was accounted for. Differential distribution of assimilates and Zn to sweetcorn cobs led to significant decreases in kernel Zn concentration with increasing kernel number. This suggests there will be challenges to achieving high kernel Zn concentrations in modern high-yielding sweetcorn varieties unless genotypes with higher Zn translocation rates into kernels can be identified.
