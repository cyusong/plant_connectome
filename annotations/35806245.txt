Soybean is sensitive to drought stress, and increasing tolerance to drought stresses is an important target for improving the performance of soybean in the field. The genetic mechanisms underlying soybean's drought tolerance remain largely unknown. Via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) combined with linkage analysis, we identified 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 22 quantitative trait locus (QTLs) that are significantly associated with soybean drought tolerance. One of these loci, namely qGI10-1, was co-located by GWAS and linkage mapping. The two intervals of qGI10-1 were differentiated between wild and cultivated soybean. A nuclear factor Y transcription factor, <i>GmNFYB17,</i> was located in one of the differentiated regions of qGI10-1 and thus selected as a candidate gene for further analyses. The analysis of 29 homologous genes of <i>GmNFYB17</i> in soybean showed that most of the genes from this family were involved in drought stress. The over-expression of <i>GmNFYB17</i> in soybean enhanced drought resistance and yield accumulation. The transgenic plants grew better than control under limited water conditions and showed a lower degree of leaf damage and MDA content but higher RWC, SOD activity and proline content compared with control. Moreover, the transgenic plants showed a fast-growing root system, especially regarding a higher root-top ratio and more branching roots and lateral roots. The better agronomic traits of yield were also found in <i>GmNFYB17</i> transgenic plants. Thus, the <i>GmNFYB17</i> gene was proven to positively regulate drought stress resistance and modulate root growth in soybean. These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying drought tolerance in soybean.
