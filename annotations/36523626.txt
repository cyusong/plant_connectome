A novel, efficient maize genetic transformation system was developed using <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation of embryo explants from mature seeds. Seeds from field grown plants were sterilized and crushed to isolate embryo explants consisting of the coleoptile, leaf primordia, and shoot apical meristem which were then purified from the ground seed bulk preparation. The infection of relevant tissues of seed embryo explants (SEEs) by <i>Agrobacterium</i> was improved by the centrifugation of the explants. Transgenic plants were obtained by multiple bud induction on high cytokinin media, followed by plant regeneration on hormone-free medium. Three different selectable markers (<i>cp4 epsps, aadA</i>, and <i>nptII</i>) were successfully used for producing transgenic plants. Stable integration of transgenes in the maize genome was demonstrated by molecular analyses and germline transmission of the inserted transgenes to the next generation was confirmed by pollen segregation and progeny analysis. Phenotypic evidence for chimeric transgenic tissue was frequently observed in initial experiments but was significantly reduced by including a second bud induction step with optimized cytokinin concentration. Additional improvements, including culturing explants at an elevated temperature during bud induction led to the development of a revolutionary system for efficient transgenic plant production and genome editing. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful transgenic plant regeneration through <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation of maize mature SEEs. This system starts with mature seed that can be produced in large volumes and the SEEs explants are storable. It has significant advantages in terms of scalability and flexibility over methods that rely on immature explants.
