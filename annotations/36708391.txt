Dissimilar patterns of variants affecting genes involved in response to herbivory, including those leading to difference in VOC production, were identified in tomato lines with contrasting response to Tuta absoluta. Tuta absoluta is one of the most destructive insect pest affecting tomato production, causing important yield losses both in open field and greenhouse. The selection of tolerant varieties to T. absoluta is one of the sustainable approaches to control this invasive leafminer. In this study, the genomic diversity of two tomato varieties, one tolerant and the other susceptible to T. absoluta infestation was explored, allowing us to identify chromosome regions with highly dissimilar pattern. Genes affected by potential functional variants were involved in several processes, including response to herbivory and secondary metabolism. A metabolic analysis for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was also performed, highlighting a difference in several classes of chemicals in the two genotypes. Taken together, these findings can aid tomato breeding programs aiming to develop tolerant plants to T. absoluta.
