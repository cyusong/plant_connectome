An understanding of land plant evolution is a prerequisite for in-depth knowledge of plant biology. Here we extract and explore information hidden in the increasing number of sequenced plant genomes, from bryophytes to angiosperms, to elucidate a specific biological question-how peptide signaling evolved. To conquer land and cope with changing environmental conditions, plants have gone through transformations that must have required innovations in cell-to-cell communication. We discuss peptides mediating endogenous and exogenous changes by interaction with receptors activating intracellular molecular signaling. Signaling peptides were discovered in angiosperms and operate in tissues and organs such as flowers, seeds, vasculature, and 3D meristems that are not universally conserved across land plants. Nevertheless, orthologs of angiosperm peptides and receptors have been identified in nonangiosperms. These discoveries provoke questions regarding coevolution of ligands and their receptors, and whether de novo interactions in peptide signaling pathways may have contributed to generate novel traits in land plants. The answers to such questions will have profound implications for the understanding of the evolution of cell-to-cell communication and the wealth of diversified terrestrial plants. Under this perspective, we have generated, analyzed, and reviewed phylogenetic, genomic, structural, and functional data to elucidate the evolution of peptide signaling.
