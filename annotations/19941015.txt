['19941015', 'Members of the casein kinase 1 family are highly conserved protein Ser/Thr  kinases found in all eukaryotes. They are involved in various cellular,  physiological, and developmental processes, but the role of this family of kinase  in plants is not well known. By localization studies employing fluorescent live  cell imaging and biochemical membrane fractionation, here we showed that  Arabidopsis casein kinase-like 6 (CKL6) localizes to motile vesicle-like  structures that cofractionate with prevacuolar markers. They were found both in  the cytoplasm and at the cell periphery and were motile within the cell.  Apparently, this motility was dependent on actin filaments and CKL6-positive  vesicles partially colocalized with a late endosomal compartment. However,  CKL6-positive structures were not sensitive to brefeldin A nor wortmannin  treatment, suggesting that they may belong to a novel compartment. Association of  CKL6-positive structures with the cell periphery at the cellular junctions was  detected after separation of the protoplasts by plasmolysis. Collectively, these  data led us to propose that CKL6 is associated with late endosomal-like  compartments that are not fully characterized and may play a role in cellular  processes important for regulating components in membrane trafficking.', '2010 Apr', 'Protoplasma', '10.1007/s00709-009-0087-y', 'Lee']
