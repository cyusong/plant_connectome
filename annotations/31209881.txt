Ski-interacting protein (SKIP) is a bifunctional regulator of gene expression that works as a splicing factor as part of the spliceosome and as a transcriptional activator by interacting with EARLY FLOWERING 7 (ELF7). MOS4-Associated Complex 3A (MAC3A) and MAC3B interact physically and genetically with SKIP, mediate the alternative splicing of c. 50% of the expressed genes in the Arabidopsis genome, and are required for the splicing of a similar set of genes to that of SKIP. SKIP interacts physically and genetically with splicing factors and Polymerase-Associated Factor 1 complex (Paf1c) components. However, these splicing factors do not interact either physically or genetically with Paf1c components. The SKIP-spliceosome complex mediates circadian clock function and abiotic stress responses by controlling the alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs encoded by clock- and stress tolerance-related genes. The SKIP-Paf1c complex regulates the floral transition by activating FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) transcription. Our data reveal that SKIP regulates floral transition and environmental fitness via its incorporation into two distinct complexes that regulate gene expression transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, respectively. It will be interesting to discover in future studies whether SKIP is required for integration of environmental fitness and growth by control of the incorporation of SKIP into spliceosome or Paf1c in plants.
