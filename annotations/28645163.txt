Chloroplasts divide to maintain consistent size, shape, and number in leaf mesophyll cells. Altered expression of chloroplast division proteins in Arabidopsis results in abnormal chloroplast morphology. To better understand the influence of chloroplast morphology on chloroplast movement and photosynthesis, we compared the chloroplast photorelocation and photosynthetic responses of a series of Arabidopsis chloroplast division mutants with a wide variety of chloroplast phenotypes. Chloroplast movement was monitored by red light reflectance imaging of whole plants under increasing intensities of white light. The accumulation and avoidance responses were differentially affected in different mutants and depended on both chloroplast number and morphological heterogeneity. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements during 5 d light experiments demonstrated that mutants with large-chloroplast phenotypes generally exhibited greater PSII photodamage than those with intermediate phenotypes. No abnormalities in photorelocation efficiency or photosynthetic capacity were observed in plants with small-chloroplast phenotypes. Simultaneous measurement of chloroplast movement and chlorophyll fluorescence indicated that the energy-dependent (qE) and long-lived components of non-photochemical quenching that reflect photoinhibition are affected differentially in different division mutants exposed to high or fluctuating light intensities. We conclude that chloroplast division mutants with abnormal chloroplast morphologies differ markedly from the wild type in their light adaptation capabilities, which may decrease their relative fitness in nature.
