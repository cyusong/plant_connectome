Seed shattering is an agronomically important trait. Two major domestication factors are responsible for this: qSH1 and SH5. Whereas qSH1 functions in cell differentiation in the abscission zone (AZ), a major role of SH5 is the repression of lignin deposition. We have determined that a KNOX protein, OSH15, also controls seed shattering. Knockdown mutations of <i>OSH15</i> showed reduced seed-shattering phenotypes. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family. In transgenic plants carrying the <i>OSH15</i> promoter-<i>GUS</i> reporter construct, the reporter gene was preferentially expressed in the AZ during young spikelet development. The RNA in situ hybridization experiment also showed that <i>OSH15</i> messenger RNAs were abundant in the AZ during spikelet development. Analyses of <i>osh15 SH5-</i>D double mutants showed that <i>SH5</i> could not increase the degree of seed shattering when <i>OSH15</i> was absent, indicating that SH5 functions together with OSH15. In addition to the seed-shattering phenotype, <i>osh15</i> mutants displayed dwarfism and accumulated a higher amount of lignin in internodes due to increased expression of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. Knockout mutations of <i>CAD2</i>, which encodes an enzyme for the last step in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, caused an easy seed-shattering phenotype by reducing lignin deposition in the AZ This indicated that the lignin level is an important determinant of seed shattering in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both OSH15 and SH5 interact directly with <i>CAD2</i> chromatin. We conclude that OSH15 and SH5 form a dimer that enhances seed shattering by directly inhibiting lignin biosynthesis genes.
