Vascular tissue, comprising xylem and phloem, is responsible for the transport of water and nutrients throughout the plant body. Such tissue is continually produced from stable populations of stem cells, specifically the procambium during primary growth and the cambium during secondary growth. As the majority of plant biomass is produced by the cambium, there is an obvious demand for an understanding of the genetic mechanisms that control the rate of vascular cell division. Moreover, wood is an industrially important product of the cambium, and research is beginning to uncover similar mechanisms in trees such as poplar. This review focuses upon recent work that has identified the major molecular pathways that regulate procambial and cambial activity.
