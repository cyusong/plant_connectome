In eukaryotes, the RHO superfamily of small G-proteins is implicated in the regulation of cell polarity and growth. Rho of Plants (ROPs)/RACs are plant-specific Rho family proteins that have been shown to regulate cell polarity, auxin transport and responses, ABA signalling, and response to pathogens. A hallmark of ROP/RAC function is their localization in specific plasma membrane domains. This short review focuses on the mechanisms responsible for membrane interactions of ROPs/RACs and how they affect ROP/RAC function.
