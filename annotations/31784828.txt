Molecular biology can serve as a tool to solve the limitations of traditional breeding and cultivation techniques related to flower patterns, the improvement of flower color, and the regulation of flowering and stress resistance. These characteristics of molecular biology ensured its significant role in improving the efficiency of breeding and germplasm amelioration of Paeonia. This review describes the advances in molecular biology of Paeonia, including: (1) the application of molecular markers; (2) genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microRNA studies; (3) studies of functional genes; and (4) molecular biology techniques. This review also points out select limitations in current molecular biology, analyzes the direction of Paeonia molecular biology research, and provides advice for future research objectives.
