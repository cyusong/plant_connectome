<i>Piriformospora indica</i> is a root endophyte having a vast host range in plants. Plant growth promotion is a hallmark of the symbiotic interaction of <i>P. indica</i> with its hosts. As a plant growth-promoting microorganism, it is important to know the mechanisms involved in growth induction. Hitherto, multiple reports have demonstrated various molecular mechanisms of <i>P. indica</i>-mediated growth promotion, including protein kinase-mediated pathway, enhanced nutrient uptake and polyamine-mediated growth phytohormone elevation. Here, we briefly present a discussion on the state-of-the-art molecular mechanisms of <i>P. indica</i>-mediated growth promotion in host plants, in order to obtain a future prospect on utilization of this microorganism for sustainable agriculture.
