Chitin-binding proteins behave as storage and antifungal proteins in the seeds of Moringa oleifera. Moringa oleifera is a tropical multipurpose tree. Its seed constituents possess coagulant, bactericidal, fungicidal, and insecticidal properties. Some of these properties are attributed to a group of polypeptides denominated M. oleifera chitin-binding proteins (in short, Mo-CBPs). Within this group, Mo-CBP<sub>2</sub>, Mo-CBP<sub>3</sub>, and Mo-CBP<sub>4</sub> were previously purified to homogeneity. They showed high amino acid similarity with the 2S albumin storage proteins. These proteins also presented antimicrobial activity against human pathogenic yeast and phytopathogenic fungi. In the present study, the localization and expression of genes that encode Mo-CBPs and the biosynthesis and degradation of the corresponding proteins during morphogenesis and maturation of M. oleifera seeds at 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after anthesis (DAA) and germination, respectively, were assessed. The Mo-CBP transcripts and corresponding proteins were not detected at 15 and 30 days after anthesis (DAA). However, they accumulated at the latter stages of seed maturation (60 and 90 DAA), reaching the maximum level at 60 DAA. The degradation kinetics of Mo-CBPs during seed germination by in situ immunolocalization revealed a reduction in the protein content 48 h after sowing (HAS). Moreover, Mo-CBPs isolated from seeds at 60 and 90 DAA prevented the spore germination of Fusarium spp. Taken together, these results suggest that Mo-CBPs play a dual role as storage and defense proteins in the seeds of M. oleifera.
