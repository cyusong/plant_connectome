Heat girdling is a method to estimate the relative contribution of phloem vs xylem water flow to fruit growth. The heat girdling process is assumed to destroy all living tissues, including the phloem, without affecting xylem conductivity. However, to date, the assumption that xylem is not affected by heat girdling remains unproven. In this study, we used in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) velocimetry to test if heat girdling can cause xylem vessels to embolize or affect xylem water flow characteristics in the peduncle of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv Dirk). Anatomical and MRI data indicated that, at the site of girdling, all living tissues were disrupted, but that the functionality of the xylem remained unchanged. MRI velocimetry showed that the volume flow through the secondary xylem was not impeded by heat girdling in either the short or the long term (up to 91 h after girdling). This study provides support for the hypothesis that in the tomato peduncle the integrity and functionality of the xylem remain unaffected by heat girdling. It therefore confirms the validity of the heat girdling technique as a means to estimate relative contributions of xylem and phloem water flow to fruit growth.

Heat girdling: !destroys! phloem
Heat girdling: !does not affect! xylem
MRI velocimetry: !confirms! heat girdling validity
MRI velocimetry: !shows! xylem functionality unchanged
