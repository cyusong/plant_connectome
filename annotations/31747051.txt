Over the past decades the role of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in signaling and cellular responses to stress has witnessed an exponential trend line. Despite advances in the subject, our knowledge of the role of NO and ROS as regulators of stress and plant growth and their implication in signaling pathways is still partial. The crosstalk between NO and ROS during root formation offers new domains to be explored, as it regulates several plant functions. Previous findings indicate that plants utilize these signaling molecules for regulating physiological responses and development. Depending upon cellular concentration, NO either can stimulate or impede root system architecture (RSA) by modulating enzymes through post-translational modifications. Similarly, the ROS signaling molecule network, in association with other hormonal signaling pathways, control the RSA. The spatial regulation of ROS controls cell growth and ROS determine primary root and act in concert with NO to promote lateral root primordia. NO and ROS are two central messenger molecules which act differentially to upregulate or downregulate the expression of genes pertaining to auxin synthesis and to the configuration of root architecture. The investigation concerning the contribution of donors and inhibitors of NO and ROS can further aid in deciphering their role in root development. With this background, this review provides comprehensive details about the effect and function of NO and ROS in the development of RSA.
