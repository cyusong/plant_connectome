Wood, also called secondary xylem, is a specialized vascular tissue constituted by different cell types that undergo a differentiation process involving deposition of thick, lignified secondary cell walls. The mechanisms needed to control the extent of lignin deposition depending on the cell type and the differentiation stage are far from being fully understood. We found that the Eucalyptus transcription factor EgMYB1, which is known to repress lignin biosynthesis, interacts specifically with a linker histone variant, EgH1.3. This interaction enhances the repression of EgMYB1's target genes, strongly limiting the amount of lignin deposited in xylem cell walls. The expression profiles of EgMYB1 and EgH1.3 overlap in xylem cells at early stages of their differentiation as well as in mature parenchymatous xylem cells, which have no or only thin lignified secondary cell walls. This suggests that a complex between EgMYB1 and EgH1.3 integrates developmental signals to prevent premature or inappropriate lignification of secondary cell walls, providing a mechanism to fine-tune the differentiation of xylem cells in time and space. We also demonstrate a role for a linker histone variant in the regulation of a specific developmental process through interaction with a transcription factor, illustrating that plant linker histones have other functions beyond chromatin organization.
