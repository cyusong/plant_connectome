Extracellular ATP is a purinergic signal with important functions in regulating plant growth and stress-adaptive responses, including programmed cell death. While signalling events proximate to receptor activation at the plasma membrane have been characterised, downstream protein targets and the mechanism of cell death activation/regulation are unknown. We designed a proteomic screen to identify ATP-responsive proteins in Arabidopsis cell cultures exposed to mycotoxin stress via fumonisin B1 (FB1) application. Arabidopsis RIBONUCLEASE 1 (RNS1) was identified by the screen, and transgenic plants overexpressing native RNS1 showed greater susceptibility to FB1, while a gene knockout rns1 mutant and antisense RNS1 transgenic plants were resistant to FB1-induced cell death. Native RNS1 complemented rns1 mutants and restored the cell death response to FB1, while a catalytically inactive version of the ribonuclease could not. The FB1 resistance of salicylic acid (SA)-depleted nahG-expressing plants was abolished by transformation with native RNS1, but not the catalytically dead version. The mechanism of FB1-induced cell death is activation of RNS1-dependent RNA cleavage, which is blocked by ATP via RNS1 suppression, or enhanced by SA through induction of RNS1 expression. Our study reveals RNS1 as a previously unknown convergence point of ATP and SA signalling in the regulation of stress-induced cell death.
