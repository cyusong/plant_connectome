Multiple stresses are becoming common challenges in modern agriculture due to environmental changes. A large set of phytochemicals collectively known as oxylipins play a key role in responses to several stresses. Understanding the fine-tuned plant responses to multiple and simultaneous stresses could open new perspectives for developing more tolerant varieties. We carried out the molecular and biochemical profiling of genes, proteins and active compounds involved in oxylipin metabolism in response to single/combined salt and wounding stresses on Medicago truncatula. Two new members belonging to the CYP74 gene family were identified. Gene expression profiling of each of the six CYP74 members indicated a tissue- and time-specific expression pattern for each member in response to single/combined salt and wounding stresses. Notably, hormonal profiling pointed to an attenuated systemic response upon combined salt and leaf wounding stresses. Combined, these results confirm the important role of jasmonates in legume adaptation to abiotic stresses and point to the existence of a complex molecular cross-talk among signals generated by multiple stresses.
