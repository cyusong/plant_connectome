['9217006', 'In flowering plants, male meiosis occurs in the microsporocyte to produce four  microspores, each of which develops into a pollen grain. Here we describe four  mutant alleles of TETRASPORE (TES), a gene essential for microsporocyte  cytokinesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Following failure of male meiotic  cytokinesis in tes mutants, all four microspore nuclei remain within the same  cytoplasm, with some completing their developmental programmes to form functional  pollen nuclei. Both of the mitotic divisions seen in normal pollen development  take place in tes mutants, including the asymmetric division required for the  differentiation of gametes; some tes grains perform multiple asymmetric divisions  in the same cytoplasm. tes pollen shows a variety of abnormalities subsequent to  the cytokinetic defect, including fusion of nuclei, formation of ectopic internal  walls, and disruptions to external wall patterning. In addition, ovules  fertilized by tes pollen often abort, possibly because of excess paternal genomes  in the endosperm. Thus tes mutants not only reveal a gene specific to male  meiosis, but aid investigation of a wide range of processes in pollen development  and function.', '1997 Jul', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.124.13.2645', 'Dickinson']
