Endophytes, which are widely found in host plants and have no harmful effects, are a vital biological resource. Plant endophytes promote plant growth and enhance plants' resistance to diseases, pests, and environmental stresses. In addition, they enhance the synthesis of important secondary metabolites in plants and improve the potential applicability of plants in agriculture, medicine, food, and horticulture. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in understanding the interaction between endophytes and plants and summarize the construction of synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) and metaomics analysis of the interaction between endophytes and plants. The application and development prospects of endophytes in agriculture, medicine, and other industries are also discussed to provide a reference for further study of the interaction between endophytes and plants and further development and utilization of endophytes.
