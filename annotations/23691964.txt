Sucrose synthase (Sus) is a key enzyme in plant sucrose metabolism. In cotton, Sus (EC 2.4.1.13) is the main enzyme that degrades sucrose imported into cotton fibers from the phloem of the seed coat. This study demonstrated that the genomes of Gossypium arboreum L., G. raimondii Ulbr., and G. hirsutum L., contained 8, 8, and 15 Sus genes, respectively. Their structural organizations, phylogenetic relationships, and expression profiles were characterized. Comparisons of genomic and coding sequences identified multiple introns, the number and positions of which were highly conserved between diploid and allotetraploid cotton species. Most of the phylogenetic clades contained sequences from all three species, suggesting that the Sus genes of tetraploid G. hirsutum derived from those of its diploid ancestors. One Sus group (Sus I) underwent expansion during cotton evolution. Expression analyses indicated that most Sus genes were differentially expressed in various tissues and had development-dependent expression profiles in cotton fiber cells. Members of the same orthologous group had very similar expression patterns in all three species. These results provide new insights into the evolution of the cotton Sus gene family, and insight into its members' physiological functions during fiber growth and development.
