Stone cells are a physical defence of conifers against stem feeding insects such as weevils and bark beetles. In Sitka spruce, abundance of stone cells in the cortex of apical shoot tips is associated with resistance to white pine weevil. However, the mode of action by which stone cells interfere with growth and development of weevil larvae is unknown. We developed a bioassay system for testing potential effects of stone cells, which were isolated from resistant trees, on weevil larvae. Bioassays using artificial diet and controlled amounts of stone cells focused on physical defence. We evaluated the effects of stone cells on establishment of neonate larvae, mandible wear and changes in relative growth rates of third instar larvae. Establishment of neonates and relative growth rates of third instars were significantly reduced by stone cells. Stone cells appeared to be indigestible by weevil larvae. Our results suggest that stone cells affect weevil establishment and development by forming a physical feeding barrier against neonate larvae at the site of oviposition, and by reducing access to nutrients in the cortex of resistant trees, which contain an abundance of stone cells in place of a more nutrient rich tissue in susceptible trees.
