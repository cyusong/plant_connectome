Nicotiana section Suaveolentes is an almost all-Australian clade of allopolyploid tobacco species including the important plant model Nicotiana benthamiana. The homology relationships of this clade and its formation are not completely understood. To address this gap, we assessed phylogenies of all individual genes of N. benthamiana and the well studied N. tabacum (section Nicotiana) and their homologues in six diploid Nicotiana species. We generated sets of 44 424 and 65 457 phylogenetic trees of N. benthamiana and N. tabacum genes, respectively, each collectively called a phylome. Members of Nicotiana sections Noctiflorae and Sylvestres were represented as the species closest to N. benthamiana in most of the gene trees. Analyzing the gene trees of the phylome we: (i) dated the hybridization event giving rise to N. benthamiana to 4-5 MyA, and (ii) separated the subgenomes. We assigned 1.42 Gbp of the genome sequence to section Noctiflorae and 0.97 Gbp to section Sylvestres based on phylome analysis. In contrast, read mapping of the donor species did not succeed in separating the subgenomes of N. benthamiana. We show that the maternal progenitor of N. benthamiana was a member of section Noctiflorae, and confirm a member of section Sylvestres as paternal subgenome donor. We also demonstrate that the advanced stage of long-term genome diploidization in N. benthamiana is reflected in its subgenome organization. Taken together, our results underscore the usefulness of phylome analysis for subgenome characterization in hybrid species.
