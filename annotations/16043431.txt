The homeotic mutant of Pisum sativum, cochleata, has stipules replaced by alternative leaf components, abnormal flowers and reduced fertility. Although the root system dry weight, root lengths and nodule numbers of cochleata are similar to those of its wild type, the nodulation phenotype of the mutant is unique. The nodules typically dichotomously branch and multiple callus and root structures emerge from their meristems. These nodule-roots incorporate a peripheral vascular bundle of the nodule into their own central vascular cylinder. Both the nodules and roots of the hybrid structures appear functional. Roles for COCHLEATA in development are discussed.
