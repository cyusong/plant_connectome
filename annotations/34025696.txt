Photoperiod is a crucial inducer of plant flowering. Cycling DOF factors (CDFs) play pivotal roles in the flowering of long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) plants. However, the functions of <i>CDFs</i> in the photoperiod regulated flowering remain unclear in day-neutral plants. In the present study, tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> L. cv. "Ailsa Craig") seedlings of the wild-type and transgenic lines of overexpressing <i>CDFs</i> were treated with different photoperiods. The flowering time and the expression pattern of <i>SlCDFs</i> and other <i>FT-like</i> genes were investigated. The results showed that tomato <i>SlCDF1</i>, <i>SlCDF2</i>, <i>SlCDF3</i>, <i>SlCDF4</i>, and <i>SlCDF5</i> are homologs to <i>Arabidopsis cycling DOF factor 1</i> (<i>AtCDF1</i>). <i>SlCDF1-5</i> expression levels were influenced by the developmental stage and the tissue location, and notably, the expression patterns throughout light environments showed two opposite trends. Among the <i>SlCDF1-5</i> overexpression transgenic lines, overexpressing <i>SlCDF3</i> delayed flowering time in both LD (16 h light/8 h dark) and SD (8 h light/16 h dark) conditions. Furthermore, <i>SlCDF3</i> led to an increase in the mRNA level of <i>SlSP5G</i>, a tomato <i>FT-like</i> gene, in LD conditions, while the transcription level of the other two <i>FT-like</i> genes, <i>SlSP5G2</i> and <i>SlSP5G3</i>, were up-regulated in SD conditions. Taken together, at the transcription level, our results demonstrated that <i>SlCDF3</i> played a significant role in controlling tomato flowering under LD and SD conditions, possibly through directly or indirectly regulating <i>FT-like</i> genes.
