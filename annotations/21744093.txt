A cDNA, BohLOL1, encoding a protein containing three zf-LSD1 (zinc finger-Lesions Simulating Disease resistance 1) domains was cloned from growing bamboo (Bambusa oldhamii) shoots. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that BohLOL1 is a homolog of Arabidopsis LSD1 and LOL1 (LSD-one-like 1), which have been reported to act antagonistically in controlling cell death via the maintenance of reactive oxygen species homeostasis. The BohLOL1 gene was differentially expressed in various bamboo shoot tissues and was upregulated in shoots with higher rates of culm elongation. The expression level of this gene in multiple shoots of bamboo, which were cultured in vitro, was also upregulated by auxins, cytokinins, pathogen infection, 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (a functional analog of salicylic acid), and hydrogen peroxide. The results suggest that BohLOL1 participates in bamboo growth and in the response to biotic stress. The DNA-binding assays and subcellular localization studies demonstrated that BohLOL1 is a nuclear DNA-binding protein. BohLOL1 might function through protein-DNA interactions and thus affect the expression of its target genes. The results of this study extend the role of plant LSD1 and LOL1 proteins from the regulation of cell death to cell growth. The growth-dependent up-regulation of BohLOL1 expression, which uniquely occurs in growing bamboo, might be one of the critical factors that contribute to the rapid growth of this remarkable plant.
