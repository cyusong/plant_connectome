Transfer cells are characterized by an amplified plasma membrane area supported on a wall labyrinth composed of a uniform wall layer (UWL) from which wall ingrowth (WI) papillae arise. Adaxial epidermal cells of developing Vicia faba cotyledons, when placed in culture, undergo a rapid (hours) trans-differentiation to a functional epidermal transfer cell (ETC) phenotype. The trans-differentiation event is controlled by a signalling cascade comprising auxin, ethylene, apoplasmic reactive oxygen species (apoROS), and cytosolic Ca2+. Apoplasmic hydrogen peroxide (apoH2O2) was confirmed as the apoROS regulating UWL and WI papillae formation. Informed by an ETC-specific transcriptome, a pharmacological approach identified a temporally changing cohort of H2O2 biosynthetic enzymes. The cohort contained a respiratory burst oxidase homologue, polyamine oxidase, copper amine oxidase, and a suite of class III peroxidases. Collectively these generated two consecutive bursts in apoH2O2 production. Spatial organization of biosynthetic/catabolic enzymes was deduced from responses to pharmacologically blocking their activities on the cellular and subcellular distribution of apoH2O2. The findings were consistent with catalase activity constraining the apoH2O2 signal to the outer periclinal wall of the ETCs. Strategic positioning of class III peroxidases in this outer domain shaped subcellular apoH2O2 signatures that differed during assembly of the UWL and WI papillae.
