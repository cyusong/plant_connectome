Fruit ripening is divided into climacteric and non-climacteric types depending on the presence or absence of a transient rise in respiration rate and the production of autocatalytic ethylene. Melon is ideal for the study of fruit ripening, as both climacteric and non-climacteric varieties exist. Two introgressions of the non-climacteric accession PI 161375, encompassed in the QTLs ETHQB3.5 and ETHQV6.3, into the non-climacteric 'Piel de Sapo' background are able to induce climacteric ripening independently. We report that the gene underlying ETHQV6.3 is MELO3C016540 (CmNAC-NOR), encoding a NAC (NAM, ATAF1,2, CUC2) transcription factor that is closely related to the tomato NOR (non-ripening) gene. CmNAC-NOR was functionally validated through the identification of two TILLING lines carrying non-synonymous mutations in the conserved NAC domain region. In an otherwise highly climacteric genetic background, both mutations provoked a significant delay in the onset of fruit ripening and in the biosynthesis of ethylene. The PI 161375 allele of ETHQV6.3 is similar to that of climacteric lines of the cantalupensis type and, when introgressed into the non-climacteric 'Piel de Sapo', partially restores its climacteric ripening capacity. CmNAC-NOR is expressed in fruit flesh of both climacteric and non-climacteric lines, suggesting that the causal mutation may not be acting at the transcriptional level. The use of a comparative genetic approach in a species with both climacteric and non-climacteric ripening is a powerful strategy to dissect the complex mechanisms regulating the onset of fruit ripening.
