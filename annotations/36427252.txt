CONSTANS (CO) is a master flowering-time regulator that integrates photoperiodic and circadian signals in Arabidopsis thaliana. CO is expressed in multiple tissues, including young leaves and seedling roots, but little is known about the roles and underlying mechanisms of CO in mediating physiological responses other than flowering. Here, we show that CO expression is responsive to jasmonate. CO negatively modulated jasmonate-imposed root-growth inhibition and anthocyanin accumulation. Seedlings from co mutants were more sensitive to jasmonate, whereas overexpression of CO resulted in plants with reduced sensitivity to jasmonate. Moreover, CO mediated the diurnal gating of several jasmonate-responsive genes under long-day conditions. We demonstrate that CO interacts with JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) repressors of jasmonate signaling. Genetic analyses indicated that CO functions in a CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1)-dependent manner to modulate jasmonate responses. Furthermore, CO physically associated with the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) subgroup IIId transcription factors bHLH3 and bHLH17. CO acted cooperatively with bHLH17 in suppressing jasmonate signaling, but JAZ proteins interfered with their transcriptional functions and physical interaction. Collectively, our results reveal the crucial regulatory effects of CO on mediating jasmonate responses and explain the mechanism by which CO works together with JAZ and bHLH subgroup IIId factors to fine-tune jasmonate signaling.
