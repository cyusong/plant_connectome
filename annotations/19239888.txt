MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key posttranscriptional regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. Plants use highly conserved as well as more recently evolved, species-specific miRNAs to control a vast array of biological processes. This Review discusses current advances in our understanding of the origin, biogenesis, and mode of action of plant miRNAs and draws comparisons with their metazoan counterparts.
