['21140166', "Plant intracellular ras-group-related leucine-rich repeat proteins (PIRLs) are a  novel class of plant leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins structurally related to  animal ras-group LRRs involved in cell signaling and gene regulation. Gene  knockout analysis has shown that two members of the Arabidopsis thaliana PIRL  gene family, PIRL1 and PIRL9, are redundant and essential for pollen development  and viability: pirl1;pirl9 microspores produced by pirl1/PIRL1;pirl9 plants  consistently abort just before pollen mitosis I. qrt1 tetrad analysis  demonstrated that the genes become essential after meiosis, during anther stage  10. In this study, we characterized the phenotype of pirl1;pirl9 pollen produced  by plants heterozygous for pirl9 (pirl1;pirl9/PIRL9). Alexander's staining,  scanning electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy indicated that  pirl1;pirl9 double mutants produced by pirl9 heterozygotes have a less severe  phenotype and more variable morphology than pirl1;pirl9 pollen from  pirl1/PIRL1;pirl9 plants. Mutant pollen underwent developmental arrest with  variable timing, often progressing beyond pollen mitosis I and arresting at the  binucleate stage. Thus, although the pirl1 and pirl9 mutations act post-meiosis,  the timing and expressivity of the pirl1;pirl9 pollen phenotype depends on the  pirl9 genotype of the parent plant. These results suggest a continued requirement  for PIRL1 and PIRL9 beyond the initiation of pollen mitosis. Furthermore, they  reveal a modest but novel sporophytic effect in which parent plant genotype  influences a mutant phenotype expressed in the haploid generation.", '2011 Feb', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-010-1324-5', 'Vernon']
