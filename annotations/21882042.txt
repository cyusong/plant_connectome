The merging of two different genomes occurs during the formation of amphidiploids, and the merged regulatory networks have the potential to generate a new gene expression pattern. We examined the genome-wide gene expression of two newly synthesized amphidiploids between Arabidopsis thaliana and the related species Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata and Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera. 1,137 (4.7%) and 1,316 (5.4%) of probesets showed differential gene expression in A. thaliana-A. halleri and A. thaliana-A. lyrata hybrids respectively, compared to the mid parent value and of these, 489 were in common. Genes that differed in expression between the parental lines tended to have an expression level in both hybrids differing from the mid parent value. In contrast to protein coding genes, there is little differential expression of transposons. Genes in the categories of chloroplast-targeted and response to stress were overrepresented in the non-additively expressed genes in both amphidiploids. As these genes have the potential to contribute directly to the plant phenotype, we suggest that rapid changes of gene expression in amphidiploids might be important for producing greater biomass.
