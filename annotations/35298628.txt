The data available so far indicate that the photosynthetic and relative growth rates of bryophytes are 10% of those reported for tracheophytes. By examining the existing literature and reanalysing data published in over 100 studies, this review examines the ecophysiological, biochemical, and structural reasons behind this phenomenon. The limiting Rubisco content and surface for gas exchange are the internal factors that can explain the low photosynthetic and growth rates of bryophytes. The role of the thicker cell walls of bryophytes in limiting CO2 diffusion is unclear, due to the current uncertainties regarding their porosity and permeability to CO2. From this review, it is also evident that, despite bryophytes having low photosynthetic rates, their positive carbon balance is tightly related to their capacity to deal with extreme conditions. Contributing factors include their capacity to deal with large daily temperature oscillations, and their capacity to delay the cessation of photosynthesis under water deficit (or to tolerate desiccation in extreme situations). Although further studies on bryophytes are needed before more solid conclusions can be drawn, it seems that their success relies on their remarkable tolerance to a highly variable environment, possibly at the expense of their maximum photosynthetic rate.
