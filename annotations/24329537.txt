['24329537', 'The enzyme ferrochelatase catalyses the formation of protoheme by inserting  Fe(2+) into protoporphyrin IX. Although most organisms express only one  ferrochelatase, all land plants analysed so far possess at least two  ferrochelatase proteins. Analysis of publicly available expression data suggests  that the two Arabidopsis thaliana ferrochelatases, FC1 and FC2, serve different  functions, corroborating previous assumptions. Co-expression analysis of FC1 and  FC2, together with microarray analyses, implies that fc1 and fc2 trigger  different modes of plastid signalling in roots and leaves, respectively, and  indicates that FC2 might be involved in stress responses. Thus, loss of FC2  increases resistance to salt and flagellin treatment. Whereas fc1 plants showed  no obvious mutant phenotype, fc2 mutants formed abnormally small, pale green  rosette leaves; were low in chlorophylls, carotenoids and several photosynthetic  proteins; and their photosynthetic performance was impaired. These phenotypes are  attenuated by growth in continuous light, in agreement with the finding that fc2  plants accumulate protochlorophyllide and display a fluorescent (flu) phenotype  in the dark. In consequence we show that, contrary to earlier suggestions, FC2  produces heme not only for photosynthetic cytochromes, but also for proteins  involved in stress responses, whereas the impairment of FC1 apparently interferes  only marginally with stress responses.', '2015 Feb', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.12248', 'Kleine']
