Plant cell walls are the first physical barrier against pathogen invasion, and plants thicken the cell wall to strengthen it and restrain pathogen infection. Bacterial blight is a devastating rice (Oryza sativa) disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which typically enters the rice leaf through hydathodes and spreads throughout the plant via the xylem. Xoo interacts with cells surrounding the xylem vessel of a vascular bundle, but whether rice strengthens the sclerenchyma cell walls to stop pathogen proliferation is unclear. Here, we found that a WRKY protein, OsWRKY53, negatively confers resistance to Xoo by strengthening the sclerenchyma cell walls of the vascular bundle. OsMYB63 acts as a transcriptional activator and promotes the expression of three secondary cell wall-related cellulose synthase genes to boost cellulose accumulation, resulting in thickened sclerenchyma cell walls. Both OsWRKY53 and OsMYB63 are abundantly expressed in sclerenchyma cells of leaf vascular bundles. OsWRKY53 functions as a transcriptional repressor and acts genetically upstream of OsMYB63 to suppress its expression. The OsWRKY53-overexpressing and OsMYB63 knockout plants had thinner sclerenchyma cell walls, showing susceptibility to Xoo, while the OsWRKY53 knockout and OsMYB63-overexpressing plants had thicker sclerenchyma cell walls, exhibiting resistance to Xoo. These results suggest that modifying these candidate genes provides a strategy to improve rice resistance to bacterial pathogens.
