Secretory and transmembrane protein synthesis and initial modification are essential processes in protein maturation, and these processes are important for maintaining protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER homeostasis can be disrupted by the accumulation of misfolded proteins, resulting in ER stress, due to specific intra- or extracellular stresses. Processes including the unfolded protein response (UPR), ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and autophagy are thought to play important roles in restoring ER homeostasis. Here, we focus on summarizing and analysing recent advances in our understanding of the role of ERAD in plant physiological processes, especially in plant adaption to biotic and abiotic stresses, and also identify several issues that still need to be resolved in this field.

ER: !maintains! Homeostasis 
UPR: !restores! Homeostasis 
ERAD: !plays important role in! Plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses
