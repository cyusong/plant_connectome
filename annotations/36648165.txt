Auxin is indispensable to the fertilization-induced coordinated development of the embryo, endosperm, and seed coat. However, little attention has been given to the distribution pattern, maintenance mechanism, and function of auxin throughout the process of seed development. In the present study, we found that auxin response signals display a dynamic distribution pattern during Arabidopsis seed development. Shortly after fertilization, strong auxin response signals were observed at the funiculus, chalaza, and micropylar integument where the embryo attaches. Later, additional signals appeared at the middle layer of the inner integument (ii1') above the chalaza and the whole inner layer of the outer integument (oi1). These signals peaked when the seed was mature, then declined upon desiccation and disappeared in the dried seed. Auxin biosynthesis genes, including ASB1, TAA1, YUC1, YUC4, YUC8, and YUC9, contributed to the accumulation of auxin in the funiculus and seed coat. Auxin efflux carrier PIN3 and influx carrier AUX1 also contributed to the polar auxin distribution in the seed coat. PIN3 was expressed in the ii1 (innermost layer of the inner integument) and oi1 layers of the integument and showed polar localization. AUX1 was expressed in both layers of the outer integument and the endosperm and displayed a uniform localization. Further research demonstrated that the accumulation of auxin in the seed coat regulates seed size. Transgenic plants that specifically express the YUC8 gene in the oi2 or ii1 seed coat produced larger seeds. These results provide useful tools for cultivating high-yielding crops.
