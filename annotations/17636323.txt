Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fibre initial cells undergo a rapid cellular re-programming around anthesis to form the long cellulose fibres prized for textile manufacture. On the day of anthesis the cotton fibre initial cells balloon out from the ovule surface and so are clearly distinguished from adjacent epidermal pavement cells. To enhance our understanding of the molecular processes that determine which cells become fibres and why adjacent epidermal cells remain in a different developmental state we studied the expression profiles of the two respective cell types. Using laser-capture microdissection, coupled with an in vitro RNA amplification system, we used cDNA microarray slides to profile the gene expression in expanding fibre initials compared to the non-expanding epidermal cells at an early stage just after the fibre initials are discernable. Except for a few regulatory genes, the genes that are up-regulated in the cotton fibre initials relative to epidermal cells predominantly encode proteins involved in generating the components for the extra cell membrane and primary cell wall needed for the rapid cell expansion of the initials. This includes synthesis of enzymes and cell wall proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. An analysis of single channel fluorescence levels confirmed that these classes of genes were also the most highly expressed genes in fibre initials. Genes involved in DNA metabolism were also well represented in the expanding fibre cell, consistent with the limited endoreduplication we previously reported to occur in fibre initial cells.
