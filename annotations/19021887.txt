Rhamnolipids produced by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known as very efficient biosurfactant molecules. They are used for a wide range of industrial applications, especially in food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical formulations as well as in bioremediation of pollutants. In this paper, the role of rhamnolipids as novel molecules triggering defence responses and protection against the fungus Botrytis cinerea in grapevine is presented. The effect of rhamnolipids was assessed in grapevine using cell suspension cultures and vitro-plantlets. Ca(2+) influx, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and reactive oxygen species production form part of early signalling events leading from perception of rhamnolipids to the induction of plant defences that include expression of a wide range of defence genes and a hypersensitive response (HR)-like response. In addition, rhamnolipids potentiated defence responses induced by the chitosan elicitor and by the culture filtrate of B. cinerea. We also demonstrated that rhamnolipids have direct antifungal properties by inhibiting spore germination and mycelium growth of B. cinerea. Ultimately, rhamnolipids efficiently protected grapevine against the fungus. We propose that rhamnolipids are acting as microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) in grapevine and that the combination of rhamnolipid effects could participate in grapevine protection against grey mould disease.
