['23973298', 'The cell nucleus communicates with the cytoplasm through a nucleocytoplasmic  linker that maintains the shape of the nucleus and mediates its migration. In  contrast to animal nuclei, which are moved by motor proteins (kinesins and  dyneins) along the microtubule cytoskeleton, plant nuclei move rapidly and  farther along an actin filament cytoskeleton. This implies that plants use a  distinct nucleocytoplasmic linker for nuclear dynamics, although its molecular  identity is unknown. Here, we describe a new type of nucleocytoplasmic linker  consisting of a myosin motor and nuclear membrane proteins. In the Arabidopsis  thaliana mutant kaku1, nuclear movement was impaired and the nuclear envelope was  abnormally invaginated. The responsible gene was identified as myosin XI-i, which  encodes a plant-specific myosin. Myosin XI-i is specifically localized on the  nuclear membrane, where it physically interacts with the outer-nuclear-membrane  proteins WIT1 and WIT2. Both WIT proteins are required for anchoring myosin XI-i  to the nuclear membrane and for nuclear movement. A striking feature of plant  cells is dark-induced nuclear positioning in mesophyll cells. A deficiency of  either myosin XI-i or WIT proteins diminished dark-induced nuclear positioning.  The unique nucleocytoplasmic linkage in plants might enable rapid nuclear  positioning in response to environmental stimuli.', '2013 Sep 23', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2013.07.035', 'Hara-Nishimura']
