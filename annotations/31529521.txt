C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic plants have evolved from C<sub>3</sub> ancestors and are characterized by differential expression of several hundred genes. Strict compartmentalization of key C<sub>4</sub> enzymes either to mesophyll (M) or bundle sheath cells is considered a crucial step towards the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. In this study, we demonstrate that the 5'-flanking sequences of the C<sub>4</sub> type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (Ppc) gene from three C<sub>4</sub> grass species could drive M-cell-specific expression of a reporter gene in rice. In addition to that, we identified about 450 bp (upstream of their transcription start site) of the analyzed C<sub>4</sub> Ppc promoters contain all the essential regulatory elements for driving M-cell-specific expression in rice leaves. Importantly, four motifs of conserved nucleotide sequences (CNSs) were also determined, which are essential for the activity of the promoter. A putative interaction between the CNSs and an unknown upstream element(s) is required for driving M-cell-specific expression. This work identifies the evolutionary conservation of C<sub>4</sub> Ppc regulatory mechanisms of multiple closely related C<sub>4</sub> grass species.
