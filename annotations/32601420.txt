Conditional manipulation of gene expression is a key approach to investigating the primary function of a gene in a biological process. While conditional and cell-type-specific overexpression systems exist for plants, there are currently no systems available to disable a gene completely and conditionally. Here, we present a new tool with which target genes can efficiently and conditionally be knocked out by genome editing at any developmental stage. Target genes can also be knocked out in a cell-type-specific manner. Our tool is easy to construct and will be particularly useful for studying genes having null alleles that are non-viable or show pleiotropic developmental defects.
