During photosynthesis, light energy is utilized to drive sophisticated biochemical chains of electron transfers, converting solar energy into chemical energy that feeds most life on earth. Cyclic electron transfer/flow (CET/CEF) plays an essential role in efficient photosynthesis, as it balances the ATP/NADPH ratio required in various regulatory and metabolic pathways. Photosystem I, cytochrome b<sub>6</sub>f, and NADH dehydrogenase (NDH) are large multisubunit protein complexes embedded in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast and key players in NDH-dependent CEF pathway. Furthermore, small mobile electron carriers serve as shuttles for electrons between these membrane protein complexes. Efficient electron transfer requires transient interactions between these electron donors and acceptors. Structural biology has been a powerful tool to advance our knowledge of this important biological process. A number of structures of the membrane-embedded complexes, soluble electron carrier proteins, and transient complexes composed of both have now been determined. These structural data reveal detailed interacting patterns of these electron donor-acceptor pairs, thus allowing us to visualize the different parts of the electron transfer process. This review summarizes the current state of structural knowledge of three membrane complexes and their interaction patterns with mobile electron carrier proteins.
