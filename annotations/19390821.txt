['19390821', 'ADAP is an AP2-domain protein that interacts with ARIA, which, in turn, interacts  with ABF2, a bZIP class transcription factor. ABF2 regulates various aspects of  the abscisic acid (ABA) response by controlling the expression of a subset of  ABA-responsive genes. Our expression analyses indicate that ADAP is expressed in  roots, emerging young leaves, and flowers. We found that adap knockout mutant  lines germinate more efficiently than wild-type plants and that the mutant  seedlings grow faster. This suggests that ADAP is involved in the regulation of  germination and seedling growth. Both germination and post-germination growth of  the knockout mutants were partially insensitive to ABA, which indicates that ADAP  is required for a full ABA response. The survival rates for mutants from which  water was withheld were low compared with those for wild-type plants. The result  shows that ADAP is necessary for the response to stress induced by water  deprivation. Together, our data indicate that ADAP is a positive regulator of the  ABA response and is also involved in regulating seedling growth. The role of ADAP  is similar to that of ARIA, which is also a positive regulator of the ABA  response. It appears that ADAP acts through the same ABA response pathway as  ARIA.', '2009 Apr 30', 'Mol Cells', '10.1007/s10059-009-0058-3', 'Kim']
