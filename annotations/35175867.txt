Soil microorganisms could affect the growth of plants and play an important role in indicating the change of soil environment. Cotton Verticillium wilt is a serious soil borne disease. This study aimed to analyze the community characteristics of soil microorganisms in cotton fields with different incidences of Verticillium wilt, so as to provide theoretical guidance for the prevention and control of soil borne diseases of cotton. Through the analysis of soil microbial communities in six fields, the results showed that there was no difference in fungal and bacterial alpha-diversity index before cotton planting, while there were differences in rhizosphere of diseased plants. For fungal beta diversity indexes, there were significant differences in these six fields. There was no significant difference for bacterial beta diversity indexes before cotton planting, while there was a certain difference in the rhizosphere of diseased cotton plants. The composition of fungi and bacteria in different fields was roughly the same at the genus level, but the abundances of the same genus varied greatly between different fields. Before cotton planting, there were 61 fungi (genera) and 126 bacteria (genera) with different abundances in the six fields. <i>Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas</i> and <i>Burkholderia</i> had higher abundances in the fields with less incidence. This study will provide a theoretical basis for microbial control of Cotton Verticillium wilt.
