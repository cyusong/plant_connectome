['35265095', 'Pectin is a major component of the plant cell wall, forming a network that  contributes to cell wall integrity and flexibility. Pectin methylesterase (PME)  catalyzes the removal of methylester groups from the homogalacturonan backbone,  the most abundant pectic polymer, and contributes to intercellular adhesion  during plant development and different environmental stimuli stress. In this  study, we identified and characterized an Arabidopsis type-II PME, PME53, which  encodes a cell wall deposited protein and may be involved in the stomatal lineage  pathway and stomatal functions. We demonstrated that PME53 is expressed  explicitly in guard cells as an abscisic acid (ABA)-regulated gene required for  stomatal movement and thermotolerance. The expression of PME53 is significantly  affected by the stomatal differentiation factors SCRM and MUTE. The null mutation  in PME53 results in a significant increase in stomatal number and susceptibility  to ABA-induced stomatal closure. During heat stress, the pme53 mutant highly  altered the activity of PME and significantly lowered the expression level of the  calmodulin AtCaM3, indicating that PME53 may be involved in Ca(2+)-pectate  reconstitution to render plant thermotolerance. Here, we present evidence that  the PME53-mediated de-methylesterification status of pectin is directed toward  stomatal development, movement, and regulation of the flexibility of the guard  cell wall required for the heat response.', '2022', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2022.836151', 'Jinn']
