['10898773', 'Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs grow longer and denser in response to  low-phosphorus availability. In addition, plants with the root hair response  acquire more phosphorus than mutants that have root hairs that do not respond to  phosphorus limiting conditions. The purpose of this experiment was to determine  the efficiency of root hairs in phosphorus acquisition at high- and  low-phosphorus availability. Root hair growth, root growth, root respiration,  plant phosphorus uptake, and plant phosphorus content of 3-wk-old wild-type  Arabidopsis (WS) were compared to two root hair mutants (rhd6 and rhd2) under  high (54 mmol/m) and low (0.4 mmol/m) phosphorus availability. A cost-benefit  analysis was constructed from the measurements to determine root hair efficiency.  Under high-phosphorus availability, root hairs did not have an effect on any of  the parameters measured. Under low-phosphorus availability, wild-type Arabidopsis  had greater total root surface area, shoot biomass, phosphorus per root length,  and specific phosphorus uptake. The cost-benefit analysis shows that under low  phosphorus, wild-type roots acquire more phosphorus for every unit of carbon  respired or unit of phosphorus invested into the roots than the mutants. We  conclude that the response of root hairs to low-phosphorus availability is an  efficient strategy for phosphorus acquisition.', '2000 Jul', 'Am J Bot', '87/7/964', 'Lynch']

Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs: !grow longer and denser! in response to low-phosphorus availability
Wild-type Arabidopsis: !has greater total root surface area! under low-phosphorus availability
Wild-type roots: !acquire more phosphorus! for every unit of carbon respired or unit of phosphorus invested than mutants
Root hair mutants: !do not have an effect! on any parameters measured under high-phosphorus availability
