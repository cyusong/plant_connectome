The photosynthetic changes evaluated by oxygen evolution, chlorophyll fluorescence, photoacoustics, and delayed fluorescence (DF) were studied in leaves of grown in vitro for 8 weeks grapevine plants (Vitis vinifera) infected by grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3). The infected leaves were characterized during the viral infection without visible disease symptoms. The symptomless infection led to a decrease in plant biomass. The non-photochemical fluorescence quenching, qN, declined, whereas the photochemical quenching, qP, and the Chl a/b ratio were not significantly affected. Photoacoustic and oxygen evolution measurements showed that the energy storage and oxygen evolution rate decreased in the infected leaves. Enhanced alternative electron sinks during the symptomless viral infection were also estimated. The changes in fluorescence and DF temperature curves demonstrated an enhanced stability of the thylakoid membranes in the infected leaves. This effect was clearly expressed at high actinic light intensities. The viral infected in vitro grown grapevine plants were used in the present study as a simplified model system that allow to avoid the involvement of different environmental factors that could interfere with the GLRaV infection and the virus-grapevine interactions. Thus, the 'pure' impact of the viral infection on photosynthesis could be investigated.
