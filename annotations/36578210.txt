The Dong people are one of China's 55 recognized ethnic minorities, but there has been a long-standing debate about their origins. In this study, we performed whole-genome resequencing of Kam Sweet Rice (KSR), a valuable, rare, and ancient rice landrace unique to the Dong people. Through comparative genomic analyses of KSR and other rice landraces from south of the Yangtze River Basin in China, we provide evidence that the ancestors of the Dong people likely originated from the southeast coast of China at least 1000 years ago. Alien introgression and admixture in KSR demonstrated multiple migration events in the history of the Dong people. Genomic footprints of domestication demonstrated characteristics of KSR that arose from artificial selection and geographical adaptation by the Dong people. The key genes GS3, Hd1, and DPS1 (related to agronomic traits) and LTG1 and MYBS3 (related to cold tolerance) were identified as domestication targets, reflecting crop improvement and changes in the geographical environment of the Dong people during migration. A genome-wide association study revealed a candidate yield-associated gene, Os01g0923300, a specific haplotype in KSR that is important for regulating grain number per panicle. RNA-sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR results showed that this gene was more highly expressed in KSR than in ancestral populations, indicating that it may have great value in increasing yield potential in other rice accessions. In summary, our work develops a novel approach for studying human civilization and migration patterns and provides valuable genomic datasets and resources for future breeding of high-yield and climate-resilient rice varieties.
