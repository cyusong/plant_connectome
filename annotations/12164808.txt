['12164808', 'Full-length cDNAs are essential for functional analysis of plant genes in the  post-sequencing era of the Arabidopsis genome. Recently, cDNA microarray analysis  has been developed for quantitative analysis of global and simultaneous analysis  of expression profiles. We have prepared a full-length cDNA microarray containing  approximately 7000 independent, full-length cDNA groups to analyse the expression  profiles of genes under drought, cold (low temperature) and high-salinity stress  conditions over time. The transcripts of 53, 277 and 194 genes increased after  cold, drought and high-salinity treatments, respectively, more than fivefold  compared with the control genes. We also identified many highly drought-, cold-  or high-salinity- stress-inducible genes. However, we observed strong  relationships in the expression of these stress-responsive genes based on Venn  diagram analysis, and found 22 stress-inducible genes that responded to all three  stresses. Several gene groups showing different expression profiles were  identified by analysis of their expression patterns during stress-responsive gene  induction. The cold-inducible genes were classified into at least two gene groups  from their expression profiles. DREB1A was included in a group whose expression  peaked at 2 h after cold treatment. Among the drought, cold or high-salinity  stress-inducible genes identified, we found 40 transcription factor genes  (corresponding to approximately 11% of all stress-inducible genes identified),  suggesting that various transcriptional regulatory mechanisms function in the  drought, cold or high-salinity stress signal transduction pathways.', '2002 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2002.01359.x', 'Shinozaki']
