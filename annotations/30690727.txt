Combined application of nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) fertilizer could significantly enhance crop yield. Crop yield and photosynthesis are inseparable. However, the influence of N and K interaction on photosynthesis is still not fully understood. Field and hydroponic experiments were conducted to examine the effects of N and K interaction on leaf photosynthesis characteristics and to explore the mechanisms in the hydroponic experiment. CO<sub>2</sub> conductance and carboxylation characteristic parameters of oilseed leaves were measured under different N and K supplies. Results indicated that detectable increases in leaf area, biomass and net photosynthetic rate (A<sub>n</sub> ) were observed under optimal N and K supply in field and hydroponic experiments. The ratio of total CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion conductance to the maximum carboxylation rate (g<sub>tot</sub> /V<sub>cmax</sub> ) and A<sub>n</sub> presented a linear-plateau relationship. Under insufficient N, increased K contributed to the CO<sub>2</sub> transmission capacity and improved the proportion of N used for carboxylation, promoting g<sub>tot</sub> /V<sub>cmax</sub> . However, the low V<sub>cmax</sub> associated with N insufficiency limited the A<sub>n</sub> . High N supply obviously accelerated V<sub>cmax</sub> , yet K deficiency led to a reduction of g<sub>tot</sub> , which restricted V<sub>cmax</sub> . Synchronous increases in N and K supplementation ensured the appropriate ratio of N to K content in leaves, which simultaneously facilitated g<sub>tot</sub> and V<sub>cmax</sub> and preserved a g<sub>tot</sub> /V<sub>cmax</sub> suitable for guaranteeing CO<sub>2</sub> transmission and carboxylation coordination; the overall effect was increased A<sub>n</sub> and leaf area. These results highlight the suitable N and K nutrients to coordinate CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion and carboxylation, thereby enhancing photosynthetic capacity and area to obtain high crop yield.
