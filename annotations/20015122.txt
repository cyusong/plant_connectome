Analyses of DNA content using fluorescence microcytophotometry showed that development of Anemia phyllitidis gametophytes coincided with endoreduplication process. The level of this process shown by the number of endopolyploid cells studied at the I-V arbitrarily established cellular gametophyte stages, was 3%, while at the VI-VII and VII* (male stages) were 10.5 and 4%, respectively. This process coincided with decreased mitotic activity of cells and concerned the cells with their profile area between 1100 and 13,000 microm(2). However, the correlation between cell size and its polyploidisation level was detected only for 12% of these cells. Endoreduplication during development of A. phyllitidis gametophytes seems to be connected with the end of cell cycle followed by the exit of cells from the cell cycle and with subsequent switch of proliferation to the postmitotic differentiation and/or to the endocycle. Endoreplication of A. phyllitidis gametophytes is a function of age, size and number of cells as well as type of gametophyte morphogenesis, which probably maintains the functional copies of genes whose number is restricted by elimination of cells from gametophytes by their death.
