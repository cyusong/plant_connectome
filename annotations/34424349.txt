MicroRNA-mediated gene regulation in non-vascular plants is potentially involved in several unique biological functions, including biosynthesis of several highly valuable exclusive bioactive compounds, and those small RNAs could be manipulated for the overproduction of essential bioactive compounds in the future. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small (20-24 nucleotides), non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression through the miRNA-mediated mechanisms of either translational inhibition or messenger RNA (mRNA) cleavage. In the past years, studies have mainly focused on elucidating the roles of miRNAs in vascular plants as compared to non-vascular plants. However, non-vascular plant miRNAs have been predicted to be involved in a wide variety of specific biological mechanisms; nevertheless, some of them have been demonstrated explicitly, thus showing that the research field of this plant group owns a noteworthy potential to develop novel investigations oriented towards the functional characterization of these miRNAs. Furthermore, the insights into the roles of miRNAs in non-vascular plants might be of great importance for designing the miRNA-based genetically modified plants for valuable secondary metabolites, active compounds, and biofuels in the future. Therefore, in this current review, we provide an overview of the potential roles of miRNAs in different groups of non-vascular plants such as algae and bryophytes.
