['16146521', 'Plastids arise by division from pre-existing organelles, and with the recent  characterization of several new components of plastid division our understanding  of the division process in higher plants has improved dramatically. However, it  is still not known how these different protein components act together during  division. Here we analyse protein-protein interactions between all known stromal  plastid division proteins. Using a combination of quantitative yeast two-hybrid  assays, in planta co-localization studies, fluorescence resonance energy transfer  and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays we show that these proteins  do not act in isolation but rather in protein complexes to govern appropriate  plastid division. We have previously shown that AtMinD1 forms functional  homodimers and we show here that in addition to homodimerization AtMinD1 also  interacts with AtMinE1. Furthermore, AtMinE1 has the ability to homodimerize. We  also demonstrate that proteins from both FtsZ families (AtFtsZ1-1 and AtFtsZ2-1)  not only interact with themselves but also with each other, and we show that  these interactions are not dependent on correct Z-ring formation. Further to this  we demonstrate that ARC6 specifically interacts with the core domain of  AtFtsZ2-1, but not with AtFtsZ1-1, providing in planta evidence for a functional  difference between the two FtsZ protein families in plants. Our studies have  enabled us to construct a meaningful intraplastidic protein-protein interaction  map of all known stromal plastid division proteins in Arabidopsis.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02493.x', 'Moller']
