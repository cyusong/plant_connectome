Transcriptional regulation, determined by the chromatin structure and regulatory elements interacting at promoter regions, is a key step in plant responses to environmental cues. Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) is a nutrient signal that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we integrate mRNA sequencing, genome-wide RNA polymerase II (RNPII), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and DNase sequencing datasets to establish the relationship between RNPII occupancy and chromatin accessibility in response to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments in Arabidopsis roots. Genomic footprinting allowed us to identify in vivo regulatory elements controlling gene expression in response to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> treatments. NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-modulated transcription factor (TF) footprints are important for a rapid increase in RNPII occupancy and transcript accumulation over time. We mapped key TF regulatory interactions and functionally validated the role of NAP, an NAC-domain containing TF, as a new regulatory factor in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport. Taken together, our study provides a comprehensive view of transcriptional networks in response to a nutrient signal in Arabidopsis roots.
