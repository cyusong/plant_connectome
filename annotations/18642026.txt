Ethylene-responsive factors (ERFs) are plant-specific transcription factors, many of which have been linked to plant defense responses. However, little is known about the functional significance of ERF genes in potato plants compared to the model plant species Arabidopsis. We show here that overexpression of CaPF1, an ERF/AP2-type pepper transcription factor gene, effectively increased tolerance to freezing, heat, heavy metal, and oxidative stress in potatoes. Interestingly, CaPF1 was involved in tuber formation in potato plants. The time course of microtuber formation was significantly retarded in potato plants that overexpressed CaPF1 compared with wild-type potato plants. Overall, the results of the present study indicate that the pepper transcription factor gene, CaPF1, is involved in promotion of multiple stress tolerance and retardation of in vitro tuberization in potato plants.
