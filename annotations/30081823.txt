Flowering time is a key trait for regional adaption and seed production in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Forward and reverse genetic studies have characterized a number of flowering-time genes. However, co-expression analysis has not been used to identify the flowering-time genes. We predicted a G2-like family transcription factor, OsPHL3, by co-expression networks analysis with photoperiodic flowering pathway genes. OsPHL3 contains a MYB-CC domain, and was localized in the nucleus with transcriptional activation potential. OsPHL3 was mainly expressed in the leaves and exhibited a circadian rhythmic expression pattern. Rice lines overexpressing OsPHL3 showed a delayed flowering time in the genetic background of TP309 under both long-day (Beijing) and short-day (Hainan) conditions. By contrast, the knockout rice lines of OsPHL3 by CRISPR/Cas9 technology promoted flowering time regardless of genetic backgrounds (i.e. Nipponbare and TP309) or day length. Further analysis indicated that OsPHL3 delayed flowering time by down-regulating the expression of Hd3a and RFT1 through promoting Hd1 under long-day conditions (LDs), or suppressing Ehd1/Hd1 under short-day conditions (SDs). Our results suggested that co-expression analysis is a useful strategy for identifying novel flowering-time genes in rice.
