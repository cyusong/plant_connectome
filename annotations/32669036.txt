Strigolactone and karrikin receptors, DWARF14 (D14) and KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2), respectively, have been shown to positively regulate drought resistance in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> by modulating abscisic acid responsiveness, anthocyanin accumulation, stomatal closure, cell membrane integrity and cuticle formation. Here, we aim to identify genes specifically or commonly regulated by D14 and KAI2 under water scarcity, using comparative analysis of the transcriptome data of the <i>A. thaliana d14-1</i> and <i>kai2-2</i> mutants under dehydration conditions. In comparison with wild-type, under dehydration conditions, the expression levels of genes related to photosynthesis and the metabolism of glucosinolates and trehalose were significantly changed in both <i>d14-1</i> and <i>kai2-2</i> mutant plants, whereas the transcript levels of genes related to the metabolism of cytokinins and brassinosteroids were significantly altered in the <i>d14-1</i> mutant plants only. These results suggest that cytokinin and brassinosteroid metabolism might be specifically regulated by the D14 pathway, whereas photosynthesis and metabolism of glucosinolates and trehalose are potentially regulated by both D14 and KAI2 pathways in plant response to water scarcity.

D14: !regulates! Cytokinin and brassinosteroid metabolism
KAI2: !regulates! Photosynthesis and glucosinolate/trehalose metabolism
D14: !positively regulates! Drought resistance
KAI2: !positively regulates! Drought resistance
