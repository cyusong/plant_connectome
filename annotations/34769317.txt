The MYB transcription factor (TF) is crucial for plant growth, development, and response to abiotic stress, but it is rarely reported in the herbaceous peony (<i>Paeonia lactiflora</i> Pall.). Here, an MYB TF gene was isolated, and based on our prior mRNA data from <i>P. lactiflora</i> samples, it was treated with drought stress (DS). Its complete cDNA structure was 1314 bp, which encoded 291 amino acids (aa). Furthermore, using sequence alignment analysis, we demonstrated that <i>PlMYB108</i> was an R2R3-MYB TF. We also revealed that PlMYB108 was primarily localized in the nucleus. Its levels rose during DS, and it was positively correlated with drought tolerance (DT) in <i>P. lactiflora</i>. In addition, when <i>PlMYB108</i> was overexpressed in tobacco plants, the flavonoid content, antioxidant enzyme activities, and photosynthesis were markedly elevated. Hence, the transgenic plants had stronger DT with a higher leaf water content and lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation compared to the wild-type (WT) plants. Based on these results, <i>PlMYB108</i> is a vital gene that serves to increase flavonoid accumulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), scavenging capacity, and photosynthesis to confer DT. The results would provide a genetic resource for molecular breeding to enhance plant DT.
