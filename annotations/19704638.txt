Pairs of guard cells form small pores called stoma in the epidermis, and the reversible swelling and shrinking of these guard cells regulate the stomatal apertures. The well-documented changes in guard cell volume have been associated with their vacuolar structures. To investigate the contribution of the guard cell vacuoles to stomatal movement, the dynamics of these vacuolar structures were recently monitored during stomatal movement in vacuolar-membrane visualized Arabidopsis plants. Calculation of the vacuolar volume and surface area after reconstruction of three-dimensional images revealed a decrease in the vacuolar volume but an increase in the vacuolar surface area upon stomatal closure. These results implied the possible acceleration of membrane trafficking to the vacuole upon stomatal closure and membrane recycling from the vacuole to the plasma membrane upon stomatal opening. To clarify and quantify membrane trafficking during stomatal movement, we describe in this addendum our development of an improved image processing system.
