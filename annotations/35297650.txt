Legume roots interact with soil bacteria rhizobia to develop nodules, <i>de novo</i> symbiotic root organs that host these rhizobia and are mini factories of atmospheric nitrogen fixation. Nodulation is a sophisticated developmental process and is sensitive to several abiotic factors, salinity being one of them. While salinity influences both the free-living partners, symbiosis is more vulnerable than other aspects of plant and microbe physiology, and the symbiotic interaction is strongly impaired even under moderate salinity. In this review, we tease apart the various known components of rhizobium-legume symbiosis and how they interact with salt stress. We focus primarily on the initial stages of symbiosis since we have a greater mechanistic understanding of the interaction at these stages.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
