Soil salinization, which is primarily due to excessive Na<sup>+</sup> levels, is a major abiotic stress adversely affecting plant growth and development. The Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter (NHX) is a transmembrane protein mediating the transport of Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> across the membrane to modulate the ionic balance of plants in response to salt stress. Research regarding NHXs has mainly focused on the vacuolar-type NHX family members. However, the biological functions of the endosomal-type NHXs remain relatively uncharacterized. In this study, 22 NHX family members were identified in <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>. A phylogenetic analysis divided the <i>GhNHX</i> genes into two categories, with 18 and 4 in the vacuolar and endosomal groups, respectively. The chromosomal distribution of the NHX genes revealed the significant impact of genome-wide duplication during the polyploidization process on the number of <i>GhNHX</i> genes. Analyses of gene structures and conserved motifs indicated that <i>GhNHX</i> genes in the same phylogenetic cluster are conserved. Additionally, the salt-induced expression patterns confirmed that the expression levels of most of the <i>GhNHX</i> genes are affected by salinity. Specifically, in the endosomal group, <i>GhNHX4A</i> expression was substantially up-regulated by salt stress. A yeast functional complementation test proved that <i>GhNHX4A</i> can partially restore the salt tolerance of the salt-sensitive yeast mutant AXT3. Silencing <i>GhNHX4A</i> expression decreased the resistance of cotton to salt stress because of an increase in the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in stems and a decrease in the accumulation of K<sup>+</sup> in roots. The results of this study may provide the basis for an in-depth characterization of the regulatory functions of NHX genes related to cotton salt tolerance, especially the endosomal-type <i>GhNHX4A</i>. Furthermore, the presented data may be useful for selecting appropriate candidate genes for the breeding of new salt-tolerant cotton varieties.
