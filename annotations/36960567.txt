Rice (Oryza sativa) is of paramount importance for global nutrition, supplying at least 20% of global calories. However, water scarcity and increased drought severity are anticipated to reduce rice yields globally. We explored stomatal developmental genetics as a mechanism for improving drought resilience in rice while maintaining yield under climate stress. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockouts of the positive regulator of stomatal development STOMAGEN and its paralog EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE10 (EPFL10) yielded lines with approximately 25% and 80% of wild-type stomatal density, respectively. epfl10 lines with moderate reductions in stomatal density were able to conserve water to similar extents as stomagen lines but did not suffer from the concomitant reductions in stomatal conductance, carbon assimilation, or thermoregulation observed in stomagen knockouts. Moderate reductions in stomatal density achieved by editing EPFL10 present a climate-adaptive approach for safeguarding yield in rice. Editing the paralog of STOMAGEN in other species may provide a means for tuning stomatal density in agriculturally important crops beyond rice.

STOMAGEN: !regulates! stomatal development
EPFL10: !regulates! stomatal development
stomagen knockouts: !conserve water! similarly to epfl10 lines
epfl10 lines: !reduce! stomatal density moderately
epfl10 editing: !provides! climate-adaptive approach for safeguarding yield in rice
EPFL10 editing: !may provide! means for tuning stomatal density in agriculturally important crops
