['36508461', 'Plants often adapt to adverse conditions via differential growth, whereby limited  resources are discriminately allocated to optimize the growth of one organ at the  expense of another. Little is known about the decision-making processes that  underly differential growth. In this study, we developed a screen to identify  decision making mutants by deploying two tools that have been used in decision  theory: a well-defined yet limited budget, as well as conflict-of-interest  scenarios. A forward genetic screen that combined light and water withdrawal was  carried out. This identified BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2) alleles as  decision mutants with "confused" phenotypes. An assessment of organ and cell  length suggested that hypocotyl elongation occurred predominantly via cellular  elongation. In contrast, root growth appeared to be regulated by a combination of  cell division and cell elongation or exit from the meristem. Gain- or loss- of  function bin2 mutants were most severely impaired in their ability to adjust cell  geometry in the hypocotyl or cell elongation as a function of distance from the  quiescent centre in the root tips. This study describes a novel paradigm for root  growth under limiting conditions, which depends not only on hypocotyl-versus-root  trade-offs in the allocation of limited resources, but also on an ability to  deploy different strategies for root growth in response to multiple stress  conditions.', '2022 Dec', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1010541', 'ORCID:']
