['11161056', 'Pyrimidine bases are rapidly catabolized in growing plant tissues. The final  enzyme of the catabolic pathway, beta-ureidopropionase (beta-UP; EC 3.5.1.6), was  partially purified from the shoots of etiolated maize (Zea mays) seedlings. The  enzyme had a K(m) for beta-ureidopropionate (the substrate derived from uracil)  of 11 microM. Only one enantiomer of racemic beta-ureidoisobutyrate (derived from  thymine) was processed with a K(m) of 6 microM. The enzyme was inactivated by  dialysis against 1,10-phenanthroline and activity could be partially restored by  addition of Zn(2+). Maize beta-UP was very sensitive to inactivation by  iodoacetamide. This could be prevented by addition of substrate, indicating the  presence of an active site Cys. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by short chain  aliphatic acids and aryl propionates, the most potent inhibitor of which was  2-(2, 6-dinitrophenoxy)-propionate (I(50) = 0.5 microM). A gene for Arabidopsis  beta-UP encodes a polypeptide of 405 amino acids and has about 55% homology with  the enzymes from other eukaryotic organisms. Several highly conserved residues  link the plant beta-UP with a larger class of prokaryotic and eukaryotic  amidohydrolases. An Arabidopsis cDNA truncated at the N terminus by 14 residues  was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme (43.7  kD) was soluble, functional, and purified to homogeneity with yields of 15 to 20  mg per 30 g fresh weight of E. coli cells. The recombinant enzyme from  Arabidopsis and the native enzyme from maize had molecular masses of  approximately 440 kD, indicating the enzyme is a decamer at pH 7.', '2001 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.125.2.1001', 'Schmitzer']
