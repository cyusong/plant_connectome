Phakopsora pachyrhizi is the causal agent of Asian soybean rust. Susceptible soybean plants infected by virulent isolates of P. pachyrhizi are characterized by tan-colored lesions and erumpent uredinia on the leaf surface. Germplasm screening and genetic analyses have led to the identification of seven loci, Rpp1 to Rpp7, that provide varying degrees of resistance to P. pachyrhizi (Rpp). Two genes, Rpp1 and Rpp1b, map to the same region on soybean chromosome 18. Rpp1 is unique among the Rpp genes in that it confers an immune response (IR) to avirulent P. pachyrhizi isolates. The IR is characterized by a lack of visible symptoms, whereas resistance provided by Rpp1b to Rpp7 results in red-brown foliar lesions. Rpp1 maps to a region spanning approximately 150 kb on chromosome 18 between markers Sct_187 and Sat_064 in L85-2378 (Rpp1), an isoline developed from Williams 82 and PI 200492 (Rpp1). To identify Rpp1, we constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome library from soybean accession PI 200492. Sequencing of the Rpp1 locus identified three homologous nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) candidate resistance genes between Sct_187 and Sat_064. Each candidate gene is also predicted to encode an N-terminal ubiquitin-like protease 1 (ULP1) domain. Cosilencing of the Rpp1 candidates abrogated the immune response in the Rpp1 resistant soybean accession PI 200492, indicating that Rpp1 is a ULP1-NBS-LRR protein and plays a key role in the IR.
