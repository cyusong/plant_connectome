Autophagy is a highly conserved and regulated catabolic process involved in the degradation of protein aggregates, which plays critical roles in eukaryotes. In plants, multiple molecular processes can induce or suppress autophagy but the mechanism of its regulation by phytohormones is poorly understood. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid phytohormones that play crucial roles in plant response to stresses. Here, we investigate the role of BRs in NBR1-dependent selective autophagy in response to chilling stress in tomato. BRs and their signaling element BZR1 can induce autophagy and accumulation of the selective autophagy receptor NBR1 in tomato under chilling stress. Cold increased the stability of BZR1, which was promoted by BRs. Cold- and BR-induced increased BZR1 stability activated the transcription of several autophagy-related genes (ATGs) and NBR1 genes by directly binding to their promoters, which resulted in selective autophagy. Furthermore, silencing of these ATGs or NBR1 genes resulted in a decreased accumulation of several functional proteins and an increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, subsequently compromising BR-induced cold tolerance. These results strongly suggest that BRs regulate NBR1-dependent selective autophagy in a BZR1-dependent manner in response to chilling stress in tomato.
