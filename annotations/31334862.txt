With the emergence of high-throughput methods in plant biology, the importance of long-term projects characterized by incremental advances involving multiple laboratories can sometimes be overlooked. Here, I highlight my 40-year effort to isolate and characterize the most common class of mutants encountered in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana): those defective in embryo development. I present an updated dataset of 510 EMBRYO-DEFECTIVE (EMB) genes identified throughout the Arabidopsis community; include important details on 2200 emb mutants and 241 pigment-defective embryo (pde) mutants analyzed in my laboratory; provide curated datasets with key features and publication links for each EMB gene identified; revisit past estimates of 500-1000 total EMB genes in Arabidopsis; document 83 double mutant combinations reported to disrupt embryo development; emphasize the importance of following established nomenclature guidelines and acknowledging allele history in research publications; and consider how best to extend community-based curation and screening efforts to approach saturation for this diverse class of mutants in the future. Continued advances in identifying EMB genes and characterizing their loss-of-function mutant alleles are needed to understand genotype-to-phenotype relationships in Arabidopsis on a broad scale, and to document the contributions of large numbers of essential genes to plant growth and development.
