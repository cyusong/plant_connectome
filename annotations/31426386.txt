Inositol signaling is believed to play a crucial role in various aspects of plant growth and adaptation. As an important component in biosynthesis and degradation of <i>myo</i>-inositol and its derivatives, inositol phosphatases could hydrolyze the phosphate of the inositol ring, thus affecting inositol signaling. Until now, more than 30 members of inositol phosphatases have been identified in plants, which are classified intofive families, including inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5PTases), suppressor of actin (SAC) phosphatases, SAL1 phosphatases, inositol monophosphatase (IMP), and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-related phosphatases. The current knowledge was revised here in relation to their substrates and function in response to abiotic stress. The potential mechanisms were also concluded with the focus on their activities of inositol phosphatases. The general working model might be that inositol phosphatases would degrade the Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> or phosphoinositides, subsequently resulting in altering Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, vesicle trafficking or other cellular processes.
