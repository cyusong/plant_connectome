The rhizotoxicity of aluminium at low-pH with Al(3+) and at high pH with Al(OH)-(4) as the main Al species was studied. Aluminium reduced root growth to similar levels at pH 8.0 and pH 4.3, although the mononuclear Al concentration at pH 8.0 was three times lower than at pH 4.3. Al contents of root apices were much higher at pH 8 than at pH 4.3. Callose was induced only marginally at pH 8 and the formation was confined to the epidermis, whereas it proceeded through the cortex with time at pH 4.3. Well-documented genotypical differences in callose formation and Al accumulation could not be found at pH 8. The largest fraction of the root-tip Al was recovered in the cell-wall fraction independent of the solution pH. A sequential extraction of isolated cell walls suggests that most of the cell-wall Al was precipitated Al(OH)(3) at pH 8.0. This can be explained by a drastic pH reduction in the root apoplastic sap to 6.2, whereas at bulk solution pH 4.3 it rose to 5.6. Al precipitation was also confirmed by the microscopic localization of Al. At pH 8, Al could mostly be found in the epidermis, but in the apoplast of the outer cortex at pH 4.3. It is proposed here that at pH 4.3, Al(3+) inhibits root growth through binding to sensitive binding sites in the apoplast of the epidermis and the outer cortex. At pH 8, Al(OH)(3) precipitation in the epidermis causes a mechanical barrier thus impairing the root-growth control of the epidermis.
