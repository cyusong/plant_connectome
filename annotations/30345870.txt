Diverse plant pathogens secrete cellulases to degrade plant cell walls. Previously, the plasmid-borne cellulase gene celA was shown to be important for the virulence of the gram-positive bacterium Clavibacter michiganensis in tomato. However, details of the contribution of cellulases to the development of wilting in tomato have not been well-determined. To better understand the contribution of cellulases to the virulence of C. michiganensis in tomato, a mutant lacking cellulase activity was generated and complemented with truncated forms of certain cellulase genes, and virulence of those strain was examined. A celA mutant of the C. michiganensis type strain LMG7333 lost its cellulase activity and almost all its ability to cause wilting in tomato. The cellulase catalytic domain and cellulose-binding domain of CelA together were sufficient for both cellulase activity and the development of wilting in tomato. However, the expansin domain did not affect virulence or cellulase activity. The celA ortholog of Clavibacter sepedonicus restored the full virulence of the celA mutant of C. michiganensis. Another cellulase gene, celB, located in the chromosome, carries a single-base deletion in most C. michiganensis strains but does not carry a functional signal peptide in its N terminus. Nevertheless, an experimentally modified CelB protein with a CelA signal peptide was secreted and able to cause wilting in tomato. These results indicate that cellulases are major virulence factors of C. michiganensis that causes wilting in tomato. Furthermore, there are natural variations among cellulase genes directly affecting their function.
