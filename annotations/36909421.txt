<i>Syntrichia caninervis</i> is a desiccation tolerant moss and is the dominant bryophyte found in biological soil crusts in the Gurbantunggut desert. In this study, we assessed the transcriptome profiles of <i>S. caninervis</i> gametophytes during the dehydration-rehydration (D-R) process (across 9 time points) using Illumina sequencing. In total, 22489 transcripts were identified, including 5337 novel transcripts, that mapped to the reference genome. A total of 12548 transcripts exhibited significant alterations in the D-R samples compared with the control samples. The differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) possessed several enriched Gene Ontology terms, such as "water stress response", "oxidation-reduction process", "membrane metabolism", "photosynthesis", and "transcription factor activity". Moreover, during early dehydration stress, the DETs were significantly enriched in stress-related pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, such as "phenylpropanoid biosynthesis", "alpha-linolenic acid metabolism", and "fructose and mannose metabolism". Photosynthesis-related transcripts (e.g., <i>ScPsa H</i>, <i>ScRubisco</i>, and <i>ScLhcb1</i>) were inhibited during the dehydration treatment and significantly accumulated during the late rehydration period. Most transcripts from the late embryogenesis abundant proteins (<i>LEA</i>) and early light-inducible protein (<i>ELIP</i>) families strongly accumulated at the late dehydration stage. These pathways were positively correlated with the content changes of absolute water content and <i>Fv/Fm</i> values, alongside peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities. Seven transcription factor families, including <i>AP2-ERF</i>, <i>bHLH</i>, <i>G2-like</i>, <i>MYB, NAC</i>, <i>WRKY</i>, and <i>bZIP</i>, were enriched in DETs during D-R treatment. This study is the first transcriptome analysis using the <i>S. caninervis</i> genome for gene annotation and multigroup D-R treatment points. Our results demonstrated the detailed dynamic changes in the transcriptome of <i>S. caninervis</i> during the D-R process. These results also improve understanding of desiccation tolerant plants' adaptations to desiccation stress at the transcription level and provide promising gene resources for transgenic crop breeding.
