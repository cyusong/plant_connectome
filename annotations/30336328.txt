Plant sphingolipids are not only structural components of the plasma membrane and other endomembrane systems but also act as signaling molecules during biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the roles of sphingolipids in plant signal transduction in response to environmental cues are yet to be investigated in detail. In this review, we discuss the signaling roles of sphingolipid metabolites with a focus on plant sphingolipids. We also mention some microbial sphingolipids that initiate signals during their interaction with plants, because of the limited literatures on their plant analogs. The equilibrium of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated sphingolipid species determine the destiny of plant cells, whereas molecular connections among the enzymes responsible for this equilibrium in a coordinated signaling network are poorly understood. A mechanistic link between the phytohormone-sphingolipid interplay has also not yet been fully understood and many key participants involved in this complex interaction operating under stress conditions await to be identified. Future research is needed to fill these gaps and to better understand the signal pathways of plant sphingolipids and their interplay with other signals in response to environmental stresses.
