Abiotic stresses, such as drought and salinity, severely affects the growth, development and productivity of the plants. The <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> RLK1-like (CrRLK1L) protein kinase family is involved in several processes in the plant life cycle. However, there have been few studies addressing the functions of CrRLK1L proteins in soybean. In this study, 38 <i>CrRLK1L</i> genes were identified in the soybean genome (<i>Glycine max</i> Wm82.a2.v1). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that soybean <i>CrRLK1L</i> genes were grouped into clusters, cluster I, II, III. The chromosomal mapping demonstrated that 38 <i>CrRLK1L</i> genes were located in 14 of 20 soybean chromosomes. None were discovered on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 7, 11, and 14. Gene structure analysis indicated that 73.6% soybean <i>CrRLK1L</i> genes were characterized by a lack of introns.15.7% soybean <i>CrRLK1L</i> genes only had one intron and 10.5% soybean <i>CrRLK1L</i> genes had more than one intron. Five genes were obtained from soybean drought- and salt-induced transcriptome databases and were found to be highly up-regulated. <i>GmCrRLK1L20</i> was notably up-regulated under drought and salinity stresses, and was therefore studied further. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that the <i>GmCrRLK1L20</i> protein was located in the cell membrane. The overexpression of the <i>GmCrRLK1L20</i> gene in soybean hairy roots improved both drought tolerance and salt stresses and enhanced the expression of the stress-responsive genes <i>GmMYB84</i>, <i>GmWRKY40</i>, <i>GmDREB-like</i>, <i>GmGST15</i>, <i>GmNAC29</i>, and <i>GmbZIP78</i>. These results indicated that <i>GmCrRLK1L20</i> could play a vital role in defending against drought and salinity stresses in soybean.
