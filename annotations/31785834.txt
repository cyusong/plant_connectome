Responses to hypoxia are regulated by oxygen-dependent degradation of kingdom-specific proteins in animals and plants. Masson et al. (2019) identified and characterized the mammalian counterpart of an oxygen-sensing pathway previously only observed in plants. Alongside other recent findings identifying novel oxygen sensors, this provides new insights into oxygen-sensing origins and mechanisms in eukaryotes.
