Functional suppression of two types of class-C genes caused transformation of pistils and stamens into petaloid organs that exhibit novel phenotypes, which gives a distinct gorgeous impression in the florets of chrysanthemum. The multiple-petal trait is a breeding objective for many horticultural plants. The loss of function of class-C genes causes the multiple-petal trait in several plant species. However, mechanisms involved in the generation of the multiple-petal trait are unknown in Chrysanthemum morifolium (chrysanthemum). Here, we isolated 14 class-C AGAMOUS (AG) genes, which were classified into two types of class-C genes, in chrysanthemum. Seven of these were categorized into CAG type 1 genes (CAG1s) and seven into CAG type 2 genes (CAG2s). Functions of class-C genes were co-suppressed by chimeric repressors and simultaneously knocked-down by RNAi to produce the multiple-petal phenotype in chrysanthemum. The expression of chimeric repressors of CAG1s and CAG2s caused morphological alteration of the pistils and stamens into petaloid organs in the ray and disk florets. Interestingly, the reproductive organs of the disk florets were transformed into petaloid organs similar to the petals of the disk florets, and those of the ray florets were transformed into petaloid organs such as the petals of the ray florets. Simultaneous knockdown of CAG1s and CAG2s expression by RNAi also exhibited a petaloid phenotype as observed in transgenic plants obtained by chimeric repressors. These results showed that CAG1s and CAG2s play important roles in the development of pistils and stamens, and the simultaneous repression of CAG1s and CAG2s resulted in a multiple-petal phenotype in chrysanthemum.
