['20622436', 'To clarify the involvement of seven Arabidopsis homologs of rat  L-gulono-1,4-lactone (L-GulL) oxidase, AtGulLOs, in the biosynthesis of  L-ascorbic acid (AsA), transgenic tobacco cells overexpressing the various  AtGulLOs were generated. Under treatment with L-GulL, the levels of total AsA in  three transgenic tobacco cell lines, overexpressing AtGulLO2, 3, or 5, were  significantly increased as compared with those in control cells.', '2010', 'Biosci Biotechnol Biochem', '10.1271/bbb.100157', 'Shigeoka']

AtGulLO2: !increases! AsA
AtGulLO3: !increases! AsA
AtGulLO5: !increases! AsA
L-GulL: !induces! AtGulLOs
