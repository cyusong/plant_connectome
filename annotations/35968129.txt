Flavonoids, the largest group of polyphenolic secondary metabolites present in all land plants, play essential roles in many biological processes and defense against abiotic stresses. In the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, flavones synthase I (FNSI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS), and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) all belong to 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODDs) family, which catalyzes the critical oxidative reactions to form different flavonoid subgroups. Here, a novel <i>2-ODD</i> gene was cloned from Antarctic moss <i>Pohlia nutans</i> (<i>Pn2-ODD1</i>) and its functions were investigated both in two model plants, <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Heterologous expression of <i>Pn2-ODD1</i> increased the accumulation of anthocyanins and flavonol in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Meanwhile, the transgenic <i>P. patens</i> and <i>Arabidopsis</i> with expressing <i>Pn2-ODD1</i> exhibited enhanced tolerance to salinity and drought stresses, with larger gametophyte sizes, better seed germination, and longer root growth. Heterologous expression of <i>Pn2-ODD1</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> also conferred the tolerance to UV-B radiation and oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant capacity. Therefore, we showed that <i>Pn2-ODD1</i> participated in the accumulation of anthocyanins and flavonol in transgenic plants, and regulated the tolerance to abiotic stresses in plants, contributing to the adaptation of <i>P. nutans</i> to the polar environment.
