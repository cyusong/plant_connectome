Eukaryotic genes are packed into a dynamic but stable nucleoprotein structure called chromatin. Chromatin-remodeling and modifying complexes generate a dynamic chromatin environment that ensures appropriate DNA processing and metabolism in various processes such as gene expression, as well as DNA replication, repair, and recombination. The INO80 and SWR1 chromatin remodeling complexes (INO80-c and SWR1-c) are ATP-dependent complexes that modulate the incorporation of the histone variant H2A.Z into nucleosomes, which is a critical step in eukaryotic gene regulation. Although SWR1-c has been identified in plants, plant INO80-c has not been successfully isolated and characterized. In this review, we will focus on the functions of the SWR1-c and putative INO80-c (SWR1/INO80-c) multi-subunits and multifunctional complexes in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We will describe the subunit compositions of the SWR1/INO80-c and the recent findings from the standpoint of each subunit and discuss their involvement in regulating development and environmental responses in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
