['19736566', 'Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5PTases) are enzymes of  phosphatidylinositol metabolism that affect various aspects of plant growth and  development. Arabidopsis 5PTase13 regulates auxin homeostasis and hormone-related  cotyledon vein development, and here we demonstrate that its knockout mutant  5pt13 has elevated sensitivity to gravistimulation in root gravitropic responses.  The altered responses of 5pt13 mutants to 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (an auxin  transport inhibitor) indicate that 5PTase13 might be involved in the regulation  of auxin transport. Indeed, the auxin efflux carrier PIN2 is expressed more  broadly under 5PTase13 deficiency, and observations of the internalization of the  membrane-selective dye FM4-64 reveal altered vesicle trafficking in 5pt13  mutants. Compared with wild-type, 5pt13 mutant seedlings are less sensitive to  the inhibition by brefeldin A of vesicle cycling, seedling growth, and the  intracellular cycling of the PIN1 and PIN2 proteins. Further, auxin  redistribution upon gravitropic stimulation is stimulated under 5PTase13  deficiency. These results suggest that 5PTase13 may modulate auxin transport by  regulating vesicle trafficking and thereby play a role in root gravitropism.', '2009 Oct', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2009.105', 'Xue']
