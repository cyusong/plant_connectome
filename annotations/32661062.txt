['32661062', 'Many developmental processes in plants are regulated by GA hormones. GA  homeostasis is achieved via complex biosynthetic and catabolic pathways. GA  catabolic enzymes include GA 2-oxidases that are classified into three classes.  Members of class III GA 2-oxidases typically act on GA precursors containing a  C(20)-skeleton. Here, we identified two further members of this class of GA  2-oxidases, namely AtGA2ox9 and AtGA2ox10, in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) genome. Both genes encode enzymes that have functional similarities to  AtGA2ox7 and AtGA2ox8, which are class III GA 2-oxidases that 2beta-hydroxylate  C(20)-GAs. Previously unknown for GA 2-oxidases, AtGA2ox9 performs  2alpha-hydroxylation of C(19)-GAs and harbors putative desaturating activity of  C(20)-GAs. Additionally, AtGA2ox9 and AtGA2ox10 exhibit GA 20-oxidase activity.  AtGA2ox9 oxidizes carbon-20 to form tricarboxylic acid C(20)-GAs, whereas  AtGA2ox10 produces C(19)-GA(9) AtGA2ox9 transcript levels increase after cold  treatment and AtGA2ox10 is expressed mainly in the siliques of Arabidopsis  plants. Atga2ox9 loss-of-function mutants are more sensitive to freezing  temperatures, whereas Atga2ox10 loss-of-function mutants produce considerably  more seeds per silique than wild-type plants. We conclude that in Arabidopsis,  AtGA2ox9 contributes to freezing tolerance and AtGA2ox10 regulates seed  production.', '2020 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.20.00594', 'ORCID:']
