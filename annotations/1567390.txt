['1567390', 'We previously showed that cor15, a cold-regulated gene from Arabidopsis thaliana,  encodes a 15 kDa polypeptide designated COR15. Here we report that COR15 has  potent cryoprotective activity in an in vitro cryoprotection assay. Specifically,  COR15 was very effective in protecting the cold-labile enzyme lactate  dehydrogenase against freeze-inactivation; on a concentration basis, it was about  10(6) times more effective than sucrose and 10(2)-10(3) times more effective than  other proteins including bovine serum albumin. The possible role of cor15 in cold  acclimation is discussed.', '1992 Mar 31', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/s0006-291x(05)80304-3', 'Thomashow']
