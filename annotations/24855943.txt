['24855943', 'DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic gene-regulation mechanism. DOMAINS  REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE (DRM) is a key de novo methyltransferase in plants,  but how DRM acts mechanistically is poorly understood. Here, we report the  crystal structure of the methyltransferase domain of tobacco DRM (NtDRM) and  reveal a molecular basis for its rearranged structure. NtDRM forms a functional  homodimer critical for catalytic activity. We also show that Arabidopsis DRM2  exists in complex with the small interfering RNA (siRNA) effector ARGONAUTE4  (AGO4) and preferentially methylates one DNA strand, likely the strand acting as  the template for RNA polymerase V-mediated noncoding RNA transcripts. This  strand-biased DNA methylation is also positively correlated with strand-biased  siRNA accumulation. These data suggest a model in which DRM2 is guided to target  loci by AGO4-siRNA and involves base-pairing of associated siRNAs with nascent  RNA transcripts.', '2014 May 22', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2014.03.056', 'Jacobsen']
