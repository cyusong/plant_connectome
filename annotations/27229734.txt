['27229734', 'Stem cell maintenance in plants depends on the activity of small secreted  signaling peptides of the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) family, which,  in the shoot, act through at least three kinds of receptor complexes, CLAVATA1  (CLV1) homomers, CLAVATA2 (CLV2) / CORYNE (CRN) heteromers, and CLV1/CLV2/CRN  multimers. In the root, the CLV2/CRN receptor complexes function in the proximal  meristem to transmit signals from the CLE peptide CLE40. While CLV1 consists of  an extracellular receptor domain and an intracellular kinase domain, CLV2, a  leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor-like protein, and CRN, a protein kinase, have  to interact to form a receptor-kinase complex. The kinase domain of CRN has been  reported to be catalytically inactive, and it is not yet known how the CLV2/CRN  complex can relay the perceived signal into the cells, and whether the kinase  domain is necessary for signal transduction at all. In this study we show that  the kinase domain of CRN is actively involved in CLV3 signal transduction in the  shoot apical meristem of Arabidopsis, but it is dispensable for CRN protein  function in root meristem maintenance. Hence, we provide an example of a  catalytically inactive pseudokinase that is involved in two homologous pathways,  but functions in distinctively different ways in each of them.', '2016 Aug', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erw207', 'Simon']
