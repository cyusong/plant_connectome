Accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) elicits a well-conserved response called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which triggers the upregulation of downstream genes involved in protein folding, vesicle trafficking, and ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Although dynamic transcriptomic responses and the underlying major transcriptional regulators in ER stress response in Arabidopsis have been well established, the proteome changes induced by ER stress have not been reported in Arabidopsis. In the current study, we found that the Arabidopsis Landsberg erecta (L<i>er</i>) ecotype was more sensitive to ER stress than the Columbia (Col) ecotype. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis with Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) isobaric labeling showed that, in total, 7439 and 7035 proteins were identified from Col and L<i>er</i> seedlings, with 88 and 113 differentially regulated (FC > 1.3 or <0.7, <i>p</i> < 0.05) proteins by ER stress in Col and L<i>er</i>, respectively. Among them, 40 proteins were commonly upregulated in Col and L<i>er</i>, among which 10 were not upregulated in <i>bzip28 bzip60</i> double mutant (Col background) plants. Of the 19 specifically upregulated proteins in Col, as compared with that in L<i>er</i>, components in ERAD, N-glycosylation, vesicle trafficking, and molecular chaperones were represented. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that transcripts of eight out of 19 proteins were not upregulated (FC > 1.3 or <0.7, <i>p</i> < 0.05) by ER stress in Col ecotype, while transcripts of 11 out of 19 proteins were upregulated by ER stress in both ecotypes with no obvious differences in fold change between Col and L<i>er</i>. Our results experimentally demonstrated the robust ER stress response at the proteome level in plants and revealed differentially regulated proteins that may contribute to the differed ER stress sensitivity between Col and L<i>er</i> ecotypes in Arabidopsis.
