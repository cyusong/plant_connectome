['8791589', 'Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) regulate apoptosis during normal development  and disease in animals. ROIs are also implicated in hypersensitive resistance  responses of plants against pathogens. Arabidopsis lsd1 mutants exhibited  impaired control of cell death in the absence of pathogen and could not control  the spread of cell death once it was initiated. Superoxide was necessary and  sufficient to initiate lesion formation; it accumulated before the onset of cell  death and subsequently in live cells adjacent to spreading lsd1 lesions. Thus,  runaway cell death seen in lsd1 plants reflected abnormal accumulation of  superoxide and lack of responsiveness to signals derived from it.', '1996 Sep 27', 'Science', '10.1126/science.273.5283.1853', 'Dangl']
