The marine diatom Rhizosolenia setigera is unique among this group of microalgae given that it is only one of a handful of diatom species that can produce highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) hydrocarbons. In our efforts to determine distinguishing molecular characteristics in R. setigera CCMP 1694 that could help elucidate the underlying mechanisms for its ability to biosynthesize HBIs, we discovered the occurrence of independent genes encoding for two isopentenyl diphosphate isomerases (RsIDI1 and RsIDI2) and one squalene synthase (RsSQS), enzymes that catalyze non-consecutive steps in isoprenoid biosynthesis. These genes are peculiarly fused in all other genome-sequenced diatoms to date, making their organization in R. setigera CCMP 1694 a clear distinguishing molecular feature. Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of RsIDI1, RsIDI2, and RsSQS revealed that such an arrangement of individually transcribed genes involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis could have arisen through a secondary gene fission event. We further demonstrate that inhibition of squalene synthase (SQS) shifts the flux of exogenous isoprenoid precursors towards HBI biosynthesis suggesting the competition for isoprenoid substrates in the form of farnesyl diphosphate between the sterol and HBI biosynthetic pathways in this diatom.
