Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) has traditionally been considered as a phytotoxin, having deleterious effects on the plant growth and survival. Recently, it was recongnized as a potential signaling molecule involving in physiological regulation similar to nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) in plants. In a recent study, we mainly focused on the signaling function of H2S in improving adaptation of Zea mays seedlings to iron deficiency. We reported that H2S was closely related to iron uptake, transport, and accumulation, and consequently increased chlorophyll biosynthesis, chloroplast development, and photosynthesis in Z. mays seedlings. Here, we provide more commentary on the signaling roles of H2S in coping with Fe deficiency in plants through increasing sulfur containing metabolites and regulating the expression level of iron homeostasis and sulfur metabolism-related genes in maize seedlings.
