Artemisinin is an important drug for resistance against malaria. Artemisinin is derived from the glandular trichome of leaves, stems, or buds of the Chinese traditional herb <i>Artemisia annua</i>. Increasing the trichome density may enhance the artemisinin content of <i>A. annua</i>. It has been proven that cyclins are involved in the development of trichomes in tomato, Arabidopsis, and tobacco, but it is unclear whether the cyclins in <i>A. annua</i> influence trichome development. In this study, we showed that <i>AaCycTL</i> may regulate trichome development and affect the content of artemisinin. We cloned <i>AaCycTL</i> and found that it has the same expression files as the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway gene. We overexpressed <i>AaCycTL</i> in Arabidopsis, and the results indicated that <i>AaCycTL</i> changed the wax coverage on the surface of Arabidopsis leaves. The trichome density decreased as well. Using yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays, we show that <i>AaCycTL</i> can interact with <i>AaTAR1</i>. Moreover, we overexpressed <i>AaCycTL</i> in <i>A. annua</i> and found that the expression of <i>AaCycTL</i> was increased to 82-195%. Changes in wax coverage on the surface of transgenic <i>A. annua</i> leaves or stems were found as well. We identified the expression of the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway genes <i>ADS</i>, <i>CYP71AV1</i>, and <i>ALDH1</i> has decreased to 88-98%, 76-97%, and 82-97% in the <i>AaCycTL</i>-overexpressing <i>A. annua</i> lines, respectively. Furthermore, we found reduced the content of artemisinin. In agreement, overexpression of <i>AaCycTL</i> in <i>A. annua</i> or Arabidopsis may alter waxy loading, change the initiation of trichomes and downregulate trichome density. Altogether, <i>AaCycTL</i> mediates trichome development in <i>A. annua</i> and thus may serve to regulate trichome density and be used for artemisinin biosynthesis.
