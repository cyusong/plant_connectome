Soybean (Glycine max) is a major grain and oil crop worldwide, but low phosphorus (LP) in soil severely limits the development of soybean production. Dissecting the regulatory mechanism of the P response is crucial for improving the P use efficiency of soybean. Here, we identified a transcription factor, GmERF1 (ethylene response factor 1), that is mainly expressed in soybean root and localized in the nucleus. Its expression is induced by LP stress and differs substantially in extreme genotypes. The genomic sequences of 559 soybean accessions suggested that the allelic variation of GmERF1 has undergone artificial selection, and its haplotype is significantly related to LP tolerance. GmERF1 knockout or RNA interference resulted in significant increases in root and P uptake efficiency traits, while the overexpression of GmERF1 produced an LP-sensitive phenotype and affected the expression of six LP stress-related genes. In addition, GmERF1 directly interacted with GmWRKY6 to inhibit transcription of GmPT5 (phosphate transporter 5), GmPT7 and GmPT8, which affects plant P uptake and use efficiency under LP stress. Taken together, our results show that GmERF1 can affect root development by regulating hormone levels, thus promoting P absorption in soybean, and provide a better understanding of the role of GmERF1 in soybean P signal transduction. The favorable haplotypes from wild soybean will be conducive to the molecular breeding of high P use efficiency in soybean.
