High temperatures cause huge yield losses in rice. Heat-shock factors (Hsfs) are key transcription factors which regulate the expression of heat stress-responsive genes, but natural variation in and functional characterization of Hsfs have seldom been reported. A significant heat response locus was detected via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using green leaf area as an indicative trait. A miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) in the promoter of a candidate gene, HTG3 (heat-tolerance gene on chromosome 3), was found to be significantly associated with heat-induced expression of HTG3 and heat tolerance (HT). The MITE-absent variant has been selected in heat-prone rice-growing regions. HTG3a is an alternatively spliced isoform encoding a functional Hsf, and experiments using overexpression and knockout rice lines showed that HTG3a positively regulates HT at both vegetative and reproductive stages. The HTG3-regulated genes were enriched for heat shock proteins and jasmonic acid signaling. Two heat-responsive JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) genes were confirmed to be directly upregulated by HTG3a, and one of them, OsJAZ9, positively regulates HT. We conclude that HTG3 plays an important role in HT through the regulation of JAZs and other heat-responsive genes. The MITE-absent allele may be valuable for HT breeding in rice.
