Driven by the increase in its frequency and duration, high temperature weather is increasingly seriously affecting crop development. High temperature inhibits the leaf development, flowering, and pollination of cotton, but its effects on the roots and root hair phenotypes and lifespans remain unclear. Thus, this study selected the two cotton varieties Nongda 601 (ND) and Guoxin 9 (GX) as materials and adopted the RhizoPot, an <i>in situ</i> root observation system, to investigate the effects of high temperature (38°C day and 32°C night) on the growth dynamics of the aboveground parts and root phenotypes of cotton at the seedling stage. The results showed that high temperature reduced the net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content, decreased the dry matter accumulation and transfer to the root, and lowered the root-shoot ratio (R/S ratio). The root phenotypes changed significantly under high temperature. After 7 d of high temperature stress, the root lengths of ND and GX decreased by 78.14 mm and 59.64 mm, respectively. Their specific root lengths increased by 79.60% and 66.11%, respectively. Their specific root surface areas increased by 418.70 cm<sup>2</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup> and 433.42 cm<sup>2</sup>·g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Their proportions of very fine roots increased to 99.26% and 97.16%, respectively. After the removal of high temperature (RHT), their root lengths tended to increase, and their proportions of very fine roots continued to increase. The root hairs of ND and GX were also significantly affected by high temperature. In particular, the root hair densities of ND and GX decreased by 52.53% and 56.25%, respectively. Their average root hair lengths decreased by 96.62% and 74.29%, respectively. Their root hair lifespans decreased by 7 d and 10 d, respectively. After the RHT, their average root hair lengths failed to recover. A principal component analysis indicated that the root architectures were significantly affected by root hair density, average root hair length, specific root length, and specific root surface area under high temperatures. In summary, cotton adapts to high temperature environments by increasing the specific root length, specific root surface area, and the proportions of very fine roots, and reducing the lifespan of root hairs.
