It is not the most grounded of the species that survive, nor the most shrewd, however one most receptive to change. Crop plants being sessile are subjected to various abiotic stresses resulting significant yield losses about an average of more than 50 percent, thus greatly threatening the global crop production. In this regard, plant breeding innovations and genetic engineering approaches have been used in the past for generating stress tolerant crop genotypes, but due to complex inheritance of abiotic stress tolerance these approaches are not enough to bring significant trait improvement and to guarantee world's future sustenance security. Although, RNA interference (RNAi) technology has been utilized amid the most recent decades to produce plants tolerant to environmental stress. But this technique ordinarily prompts to down-regulate as opposed to complete inhibition of target genes. Therefore, scientist/researchers were looking for techniques that should be efficient, precise and reliable as well as have potential to solve the issues experienced by previous approaches, and hence the CRISPR/Cas system came into spotlight. Although, only few studies using CRISPR/Cas approach for targeting abiotic stress tolerance related genes have been reported, but suggested its effective role for future applications in molecular breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerance. Hence, genome engineering via CRISPR-Cas system for targeted mutagenesis promise its immense potential in generating elite cultivars of crop plants with enhanced and durable climate resilience. Lastly, CRISPR-Cas will be future of crop breeding as well as to target minor gene variation of complex quantitative traits, and thus will be the key approach to release global hunger and maintain food security.
