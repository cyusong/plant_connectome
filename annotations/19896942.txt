['19896942', "Histidine triad (HIT)-family proteins interact with different mono- and  dinucleotides and catalyze their hydrolysis. During a study of the substrate  specificity of seven HIT-family proteins, we have shown that each can act as a  sulfohydrolase, catalyzing the liberation of AMP from adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate  (APS or SO(4)-pA). However, in the presence of orthophosphate, Arabidopsis  thaliana Hint4 and Caenorhabditis elegans DcpS also behaved as APS  phosphorylases, forming ADP. Low pH promoted the phosphorolytic and high pH the  hydrolytic activities. These proteins, and in particular Hint4, also catalyzed  hydrolysis or phosphorolysis of some other adenylyl-derivatives but at lower  rates than those for APS cleavage. A mechanism for these activities is proposed  and the possible role of some HIT-proteins in APS metabolism is discussed.", '2010 Jan 4', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2009.11.003', 'Bieganowski']
