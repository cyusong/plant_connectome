['15821992', 'We report the identification by two hybrid screens of two novel similar proteins,  called Arabidopsis thaliana gamma carbonic anhydrase like1 and 2 (AtgammaCAL1 and  AtgammaCAL2), that interact specifically with putative Arabidopsis thaliana gamma  Carbonic Anhydrase (AtgammaCA) proteins in plant mitochondria. The interaction  region that was located in the N-terminal 150 amino acids of mature AtgammaCA and  AtgammaCA like proteins represents a new interaction domain. In vitro experiments  indicate that these proteins are imported into mitochondria and are associated  with mitochondrial complex I as AtgammaCAs. All plant species analyzed contain  both AtgammaCA and AtgammaCAL sequences indicating that these genes were  conserved throughout plant evolution. Structural modeling of AtgammaCAL sequences  show a deviation of functionally important active site residues with respect to  gammaCAs but could form active interfaces in the interaction with AtgammaCAs. We  postulate a CA complex tightly associated to plant mitochondrial complex.', '2004 Dec', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-004-6324-z', 'Zabaleta']
