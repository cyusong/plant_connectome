['11333251', 'Like many other plant disease resistance genes, Arabidopsis thaliana RPS2 encodes  a product with nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)  domains. This study explored the hypothesized interaction of RPS2 with other host  factors that may be required for perception of Pseudomonas syringae pathogens  that express avrRpt2 and/or for the subsequent induction of plant defense  responses. Crosses between Arabidopsis ecotypes Col-0 (resistant) and Po-1  (susceptible) revealed segregation of more than one gene that controls resistance  to P. syringae that express avrRpt2. Many F(2) and F(3) progeny exhibited  intermediate resistance phenotypes. In addition to RPS2, at least one additional  genetic interval associated with this defense response was identified and mapped  using quantitative genetic methods. Further genetic and molecular genetic  complementation experiments with cloned RPS2 alleles revealed that the Po-1  allele of RPS2 can function in a Col-0 genetic background, but not in a Po-1  background. The other resistance-determining genes of Po-1 can function, however,  as they successfully conferred resistance in combination with the Col-0 allele of  RPS2. Domain-swap experiments revealed that in RPS2, a polymorphism at six amino  acids in the LRR region is responsible for this allele-specific ability to  function with other host factors.', '2001 May', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/158.1.439', 'Bent']
