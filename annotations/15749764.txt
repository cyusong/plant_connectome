['15749764', 'In animals, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) are important regulators of  cell cycle progression. Recently, putative CKIs were also identified in plants,  and in previous studies, Arabidopsis thaliana plants misexpressing CKIs were  found to have reduced endoreplication levels and decreased numbers of cells  consistent with a function of CKIs in blocking the G1-S cell cycle transition.  Here, we demonstrate that at least one inhibitor from Arabidopsis, ICK1/KRP1, can  also block entry into mitosis but allows S-phase progression causing  endoreplication. Our data suggest that plant CKIs act in a  concentration-dependent manner and have an important function in cell  proliferation as well as in cell cycle exit and in turning from a mitotic to an  endoreplicating cell cycle mode. Endoreplication is usually associated with  terminal differentiation; we observed, however, that cell fate specification  proceeded independently from ICK1/KRP1-induced endoreplication. Strikingly, we  found that endoreplicated cells were able to reenter mitosis, emphasizing the  high degree of flexibility of plant cells during development. Moreover, we show  that in contrast with animal CDK inhibitors, ICK1/KRP1 can move between cells. On  the one hand, this challenges plant cell cycle control with keeping CKIs locally  controlled, and on the other hand this provides a possibility of linking cell  cycle control in single cells with the supracellular organization of a tissue or  an organ.', '2005 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.030486', 'Schnittger']
