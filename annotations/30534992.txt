The activity of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which catalyses the transformation of four ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) to their corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDPs), is the main determiner of the cellular concentration of dNTP pools and should be tightly coordinated with DNA synthesis and cell-cycle progression. Constitutively increased or decreased RNR activity interferes with DNA replication and leads to arrested cell cycle progression; however, the mechanisms underlying these disruptive effects in higher plants remain to be uncovered. In this study, we identified a RNR large subunit mutant, sistl1, in Setaria italica (foxtail millet), which exhibited growth retardation as well as striped leaf phenotype, i.e. irregularly reduced leaf vein distances and decreased chloroplast biogenesis. We determined that a Gly737 to Glu substitution occurring in the C-terminus of the SiSTL1 protein slightly affected its optimal function, leading in turn to the reduced expression of genes variously involved in the assembly and activation of the DNA pre-replicative complex, elongation of replication forks and S phase entry. Our study provides new insights into how SiSTL1 regulates plant growth, chloroplast biogenesis, and cell cycle progression in Poaceae crops.
