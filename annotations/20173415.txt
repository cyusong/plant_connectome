Experiments performed in space have evidenced that, in root meristematic cells, the absence of gravity results in the uncoupling of cell growth and cell proliferation, two essential cellular functions that support plant growth and development, which are strictly coordinated under normal ground gravity conditions. In space, cell proliferation appears enhanced whereas cell growth is depleted. Since coordination of cell growth and proliferation is a major feature of meristematic cells, the observed uncoupling is a serious stress condition for these cells producing important alterations in the developmental pattern of the plant. Auxin plays a major role in these processes both by assuring the coupling of cell growth and proliferation under normal conditions and by exerting a decisive influence in the uncoupling under altered gravity conditions. Auxin is a mediator of the transduction of the gravitropic signal and its distribution in the root is altered subsequent to a change in the gravity conditions. This altered distribution may produce changes in the expression of specific growth coordinators leading to the alteration of cell cycle and protein synthesis. Therefore, available data indicate that the effects of altered gravity on cell growth and proliferation are the consequence of the transduction of the gravitropic signal perceived by columella cells, in the root tip.
