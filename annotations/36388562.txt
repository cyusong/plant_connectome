Powdery mildew caused by <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Bgt</i>) is a destructive disease of wheat throughout the world. Host resistance is considered the most sustainable way to control this disease. Powdery mildew resistance gene <i>Pm2b</i> was mapped to the same genetic interval with <i>Pm2a</i> and <i>PmCH1357</i> cloned previously, but showed different resistance spectra from them, indicating that they might be caused by different resistance genes or alleles. In this study, <i>Pm2b</i> was delimited to a 1.64 Mb physical interval using a large segregating population containing 4,354 F<sub>2:3</sub> families of resistant parent KM2939 and susceptible cultivar Shimai 15. In this interval, <i>TraesCS5D03G0111700</i> encoding the coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat protein (CC-NBS-LRR) was determined as the candidate gene of <i>Pm2b</i>. Silencing by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) technology and two independent mutants analysis in KM2939 confirmed the candidate gene <i>TraesCS5D03G0111700</i> was <i>Pm2b</i>. The sequence of <i>Pm2b</i> was consistent with <i>Pm2a/PmCH1357.</i> Subcellular localization showed <i>Pm2b</i> was located on the cell nucleus and plasma membrane. <i>Pm2b</i> had the highest expression level in leaves and was rapidly up-regulated after inoculating with <i>Bgt</i> isolate E09. The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and luciferase complementation imaging assays (LCI) showed that PM2b could self-associate through the NB domain. Notably, we identified PM2b interacting with the transcription factor TaWRKY76-D, which depended on the NB domain of PM2b and WRKY domain of TaWRKY76-D. TaWRKY76-D negatively regulated the resistance to powdery mildew in wheat. The specific KASP marker <i>K529</i> could take the advantage of high-throughput and high-efficiency for detecting <i>Pm2b</i> and be useful in molecular marker assisted-selection breeding. In conclusion, cloning and disease resistance mechanism analysis of <i>Pm2b</i> provided an example to emphasize a need of the molecular isolation of resistance genes, which has implications in marker assisted wheat breeding.
