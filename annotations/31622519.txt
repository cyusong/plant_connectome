['31622519', 'Epigenetic modifications have emerged as an important mechanism underlying plant  defence against pathogens. We examined the role of JMJ14, a Jumonji (JMJ)  domain-containing H3K4 demethylase, in local and systemic plant immune responses  in Arabidopsis. The function of JMJ14 in local or systemic defence response was  investigated by pathogen growth assays and by analysing expression and H3K4me3  enrichments of key defence genes using qPCR and ChIP-qPCR. Salicylic acid (SA)  and pipecolic acid (Pip) levels were quantified and function of JMJ14 in SA- and  Pip-mediated defences was analysed in Col-0 and jmj14 plants. jmj14 mutants were  compromised in both local and systemic defences. JMJ14 positively regulates  pathogen-induced H3K4me3 enrichment and expression of defence genes involved in  SA- and Pip-mediated defence pathways. Consequently, loss of JMJ14 results in  attenuated defence gene expression and reduced Pip accumulation during  establishment of systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Exogenous Pip partially  restored SAR in jmj14 plants, suggesting that JMJ14 regulated Pip biosynthesis  and other downstream factors regulate SAR in jmj14 plants. JMJ14 positively  modulates defence gene expressions and Pip levels in Arabidopsis.', '2020 Mar', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.16270', 'ORCID:']
