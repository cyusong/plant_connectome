Prolonged storage of rice seeds can lead to a decrease in seed vigor and seedling quality. The Lipoxygenase (LOX) gene family is widely distributed in plants, and LOX activity is closely related to seed viability and stress tolerance. In this study, the lipoxygenase OsLOX10 gene from the 9-lipoxygenase metabolic pathway was cloned from rice, and its roles in determining seed longevity and tolerance to saline-alkaline stress caused by Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in rice seedlings were mainly investigated. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of OsLOX10 increased seed longevity compared with the wild-type and OsLOX10 overexpression lines in response to artificial aging. The expression levels of other 9-lipoxygenase metabolic pathway related genes, such as LOX1, LOX2 and LOX3, were increased in the LOX10 overexpression lines. Quantitative real-time PCR and histochemical staining analysis showed that the expression of LOX10 was highest in seed hulls, anthers and the early germinating seeds. KI-I<sub>2</sub> staining of starch showed that LOX10 could catalyze the degradation of linoleic acid. Furthermore, we found that the transgenic lines overexpressing LOX10 showed better tolerance to saline-alkaline stress than the wild-type and knockout mutant lines. Overall, our study demonstrated that the knockout LOX10 mutant increased seed longevity, whereas overexpression of LOX10 enhanced tolerance to saline-alkaline stress in rice seedlings.
