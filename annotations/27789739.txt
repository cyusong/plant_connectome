['27789739', 'A variety of eukaryotes, in particular plants, do not contain the required number  of tRNAs to support the translation of mitochondria-encoded genes and thus need  to import tRNAs from the cytosol. This study identified two Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) proteins, Tric1 and Tric2 (for tRNA import component),  which on simultaneous inactivation by T-DNA insertion lines displayed a severely  delayed and chlorotic growth phenotype and significantly reduced tRNA import  capacity into isolated mitochondria. The predicted tRNA-binding domain of Tric1  and Tric2, a sterile-alpha-motif at the C-terminal end of the protein, was required  to restore tRNA uptake ability in mitochondria of complemented plants. The  purified predicted tRNA-binding domain binds the T-arm of the tRNA for alanine  with conserved lysine residues required for binding. T-DNA inactivation of both  Tric proteins further resulted in an increase in the in vitro rate of in  organello protein synthesis, which was mediated by a reorganization of the  nuclear transcriptome, in particular of genes encoding a variety of proteins  required for mitochondrial gene expression at both the transcriptional and  translational levels. The characterization of Tric1/2 provides mechanistic  insight into the process of tRNA import into mitochondria and supports the theory  that the tRNA import pathway resulted from the repurposing of a preexisting  protein import apparatus.', '2016 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.01519', 'Whelan']
