Grain quality improvement is a key target for rice breeders, along with yield. It is a multigenic trait that is simultaneously influenced by many factors. Over the past few decades, breeding for semi-dwarf cultivars and hybrids has significantly contributed to the attainment of high yield demands but reduced grain quality, which thus needs the attention of researchers. The availability of rice genome sequences has facilitated gene discovery, targeted mutagenesis, and revealed functional aspects of rice grain quality attributes. Some success has been achieved through the application of molecular markers to understand the genetic mechanisms for better rice grain quality; however, researchers have opted for novel strategies. Genomic alteration employing genome editing technologies (GETs) like clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) for reverse genetics has opened new avenues of research in the life sciences, including for rice grain quality improvement. Currently, CRISPR/Cas9 technology is widely used by researchers for genome editing to achieve the desired biological objectives, because of its simple targeting. Over the past few years many genes that are related to various aspects of rice grain quality have been successfully edited via CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Interestingly, studies on functional genomics at larger scales have become possible because of the availability of GETs. In this review, we discuss the progress made in rice by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 editing system and its eminent applications. We also elaborate possible future avenues of research with this system, and our understanding regarding the biological mechanism of rice grain quality improvement.
