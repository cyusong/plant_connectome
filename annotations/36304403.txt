Pollen morphology, pollen vigor, and long-term pollen storage are critical for plant cross-breeding and genetic improvement of <i>Exochorda racemosa</i>. We developed a protocol for viability determination and storage of <i>E. racemosa</i> pollen for breeding new varieties. The medium components for <i>E. racemosa</i> pollen germination was optimized by using an Orthogonal Assay Test Strategy (OATS). The germination rates of <i>E. racemosa</i> pollen were investigated after storing at different temperatures and different storage periods. The size of <i>E. racemosa</i> pollen was medium with three germination ditches, and the sculptural type of pollen was striate. Red ink and 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) can effectively distinguish viable pollen from the unviable pollen of <i>E. racemosa</i>. The most suitable medium (CK2) for <i>E. racemosa</i> was composed of 150 g· L<sup>-1</sup> sucrose, 100 mg·L<sup>-1</sup> boric acid, 150 mg· L<sup>-1</sup> Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and 50 mg· L<sup>-1</sup> GA<sub>3</sub>. Low-temperature stress produced the greater inhibition of pollen tube growth compared with high-temperature conditions. The CK2 medium at pH 6.5 resulted in the highest pollen germination rate and most extended pollen tube length. The optimal temperature for storage of dried pollen was -80°C (<i>P</i> < 0.01), and the germination rate was 53.60% after storage for 390 days. Thawing in a 35°C water bath produced the best viability of <i>E. racemosa</i> pollen after storage at -20°C and -80°C. The short-term storage of <i>E. racemosa</i> fresh pollen at 4°C was better than that at -20°C and -80°C (<i>P</i> < 0.01). It is possible to evaluate pollen quality and store pollen grains for <i>E. racemosa</i> by the parameters defined in this study.
