<i>Verticillium</i>, representing one of the world's major pathogens, causes Verticillium wilt in important woody species, ornamentals, agricultural, etc., consequently resulting in a serious decline in production and quality, especially in cotton. <i>Gossupium hirutum</i> and <i>Gossypium barbadense</i> are two kinds of widely cultivated cotton species that suffer from Verticillium wilt, while <i>G. barbadense</i> has much higher resistance toward it than <i>G. hirsutum</i>. However, the molecular mechanism regarding their divergence in Verticillium wilt resistance remains largely unknown. In the current study, <i>G. barbadense cv.</i> Hai7124 and <i>G. hirsutum</i> acc. TM-1 were compared at 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h post-inoculation (hpi) utilizing high throughput RNA-Sequencing. As a result, a total of 3,549 and 4,725 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, respectively. In particular, the resistant type Hai7124 displayed an earlier and faster detection and signaling response to the <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> infection and demonstrated higher expression levels of defense-related genes over TM-1 with respect to transcription factors, plant hormone signal transduction, plant-pathogen interaction, and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of divergence in <i>Verticillium wilt</i> resistance between <i>G. barbadense</i> and <i>G. hirsutum</i> and important candidate genes for breeding <i>V. dahliae</i> resistant cotton cultivars.
