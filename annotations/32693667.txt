Guard cells undergo quick volume changes during stomatal movements. However, the contribution of aquaporins to stomatal movements has not been well understood. The plasma membrane aquaporin PIP2;1in Arabidopsis has been found to mediate abscisic acid-induced or flag22-induced stomatal closure. In this research, we investigated the role of PIP2;1 in light-induced stomatal opening by measuring the stomatal apertures of the <i>pip2;1</i> mutant and <i>PIP2;1</i> overexpression lines after light treatment. <i>pip2;1</i> mutant exhibited a larger stomatal aperture, and the overexpression lines displayed a smaller stomatal aperture. It has been reported that the phosphorylation at Ser-280 and Ser-283 of PIP2;1 in rosette tissue increased in response to darkness, whereas osmotic water permeability (<i>P</i><sub>f</sub>) in mesophyll protoplasts in darkness was lower than that under light, suggesting that phosphorylation at Ser-280 and Ser-283 of PIP2;1 affected <i>P</i><sub>f</sub> in mesophyll protoplasts. Therefore, we obtained the <i>pip2;1</i> mutant expressing phosphorylation-deficient (<i>PIP2;1 AA</i>) or phosphomimetic (<i>PIP2;1 DD</i>) forms of <i>PIP2;1</i>. The <i>PIP2;1 AA</i> lines exhibited a larger stomatal aperture as <i>pip2;1</i> mutant, whereas <i>PIP2;1 DD</i> lines exhibited a smaller stomatal aperture as <i>PIP2;1</i> overexpression lines under light. These results suggest that PIP2;1 plays a negative role in light-induced stomatal opening, and phosphorylation of PIP2;1 at Ser-280 and Ser-283 causes reduced water absorption in guard cells and decreased stomatal opening.
