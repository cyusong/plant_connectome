['26990896', 'The cuticle plays a critical role in plant survival during extreme drought  conditions. There are, however, surprisingly, many gaps in our understanding of  cuticle biosynthesis. An Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA mutant library was screened  for mutants with enhanced transpiration using a simple condensation spot method.  Five mutants, named cool breath (cb), were isolated. The cb5 mutant was found to  be allelic to bodyguard (bdg), which is affected in an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold protein  important for cuticle structure. The analysis of cuticle components in cb5  (renamed as bdg-6) and another T-DNA mutant allele (bdg-7) revealed no impairment  in wax synthesis, but a strong decrease in total cutin monomer load in young  leaves and flowers. Root suberin content was also reduced. Overexpression of BDG  increased total leaf cutin monomer content nearly four times by affecting  preferentially C18 polyunsaturated omega-OH fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids.  Whole-plant gas exchange analysis showed that bdg-6 had higher cuticular  conductance and rate of transpiration; however, plant lines overexpressing BDG  resembled the wild-type with regard to these characteristics. This study  identifies BDG as an important component of the cutin biosynthesis machinery in  Arabidopsis. We also show that, using BDG, cutin can be greatly modified without  altering the cuticular water barrier properties and transpiration.', '2016 Jul', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13924', 'Kollist']
