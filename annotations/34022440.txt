Although taste is an important aspect of fruit quality, an understanding of its genetic control remains elusive in apple and other fruit crops. In this study, we conducted genomic sequence analysis of 497 Malus accessions and revealed erosion of genetic diversity caused by apple breeding and possible independent domestication events of dessert and cider apples. Signatures of selection for fruit acidity and size, but not for fruit sugar content, were detected during the processes of both domestication and improvement. Furthermore, we found that single mutations in major genes affecting fruit taste, including Ma1, MdTDT, and MdSOT2, dramatically decrease malate, citrate, and sorbitol accumulation, respectively, and correspond to important domestication events. Interestingly, Ma1 was identified to have pleiotropic effects on both organic acid content and sugar:acid ratio, suggesting that it plays a vital role in determining fruit taste. Fruit taste is unlikely to have been negatively affected by linkage drag associated with selection for larger fruit that resulted from the pyramiding of multiple genes with minor effects on fruit size. Collectively, our study provides new insights into the genetic basis of fruit quality and its evolutionary roadmap during apple domestication, pinpointing several candidate genes for genetic manipulation of fruit taste in apple.

Ma1: !affects! Fruit taste 
MdTDT: !decreases! Malate accumulation 
MdSOT2: !decreases! Citrate accumulation 
Ma1: !affects! Sugar:acid ratio 
Multiple genes: !pyramid! Fruit size
