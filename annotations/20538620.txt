We have previously identified two target genes (slr1667 and slr1668) for transcriptional regulation by a cAMP receptor protein, SYCRP1, in a cAMP-dependent manner. For this study we investigated the localizations of products of slr1667 and slr1668 (designated cccS and cccP, respectively) biochemically and immunocytochemically, and examined the phenotypes of their disruptants. CccS protein was detected in the culture medium and the acid-soluble fraction containing proteins derived from outside the outer membrane. Disruptants of cccS and cccP showed a more or less similar pleiotropic phenotype. Several proteins secreted into the culture medium or retained on the outside of the outer membrane were greatly reduced in both disruptants compared with the wild type. Electron microscopy revealed that the cccS disruptant lacked the thick pili responsible for motility and that the cccP disruptant had almost no discernible thick pili on its cell surface. Both disruptants largely secreted far greater amounts of yellow pigments into the culture medium than did the wild type. Furthermore, the disruptions reduced the amount of UV-absorbing compound(s) extractable from the exopolysaccharide layer. These results suggest that the cccS and cccP genes are involved in the construction of cell surface components in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.
