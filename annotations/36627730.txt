['36627730', 'Elongation factors modulate the efficiency of mRNA synthesis by RNA polymerase II  (RNAPII) in the context of chromatin, thus contributing to implement proper gene  expression programmes. The zinc-finger protein elongation factor 1 (ELF1) is a  conserved transcript elongation factor (TEF), whose molecular function so far has  not been studied in plants. Using biochemical approaches, we examined the  interaction of Arabidopsis ELF1 with DNA and histones in vitro and with the  RNAPII elongation complex in vivo. In addition, cytological assays demonstrated  the nuclear localisation of the protein, and by means of double-mutant analyses,  interplay with genes encoding other elongation factors was explored. The  genome-wide distribution of ELF1 was addressed by chromatin immunoprecipitation.  ELF1 isolated from Arabidopsis cells robustly copurified with RNAPII and various  other elongation factors including SPT4-SPT5, SPT6, IWS1, FACT and PAF1C.  Analysis of a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing mutant of ELF1 revealed distinct  genetic interactions with mutants deficient in other elongation factors.  Moreover, ELF1 associated with genomic regions actively transcribed by RNAPII.  However, ELF1 occupied only c. 33% of the RNAPII transcribed loci with preference  for inducible rather than constitutively expressed genes. Collectively, these  results establish that Arabidopsis ELF1 shares several characteristic attributes  with RNAPII TEFs.', '2023 Apr', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.18724', 'ORCID:']
