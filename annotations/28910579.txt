['28910579', 'The Arabidopsis PEN3 ABC transporter accumulates at sites of pathogen detection,  where it is involved in defense against a number of pathogens. Perception of  PAMPs by pattern recognition receptors initiates recruitment of PEN3 and also  leads to PEN3 phosphorylation at multiple amino acid residues. Whether  PAMP-induced phosphorylation of PEN3 is important for its defense function or  focal recruitment has not been addressed. In this study, we evaluated the role of  PEN3 phosphorylation in modulating the localization and defense function of the  transporter. We report that PEN3 phosphorylation is critical for its function in  defense, but dispensable for recruitment to powdery mildew penetration sites.  These results indicate that PAMP-induced phosphorylation is likely to regulate  the transport activity of PEN3.', '2017 Oct 3', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.1080/15592324.2017.1379644', 'Somerville']
