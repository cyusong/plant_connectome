Messenger RNA (mRNA) maturation in eukaryotic cells requires the formation of the 3' end, which includes two tightly coupled steps: the committing cleavage reaction that requires both correct cis-element signals and cleavage complex formation, and the polyadenylation step that adds a polyadenosine [poly(A)] tract to the newly generated 3' end. An in vitro biochemical assay plays a critical role in studying this process. The lack of such an assay system in plants hampered the study of plant mRNA 3'-end formation for the last two decades. To address this, we have now established and characterized a plant in vitro cleavage assay system, in which nuclear protein extracts from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) suspension cell cultures can accurately cleave different pre-mRNAs at expected in vivo authenticated poly(A) sites. The specific activity is dependent on appropriate cis-elements on the substrate RNA. When complemented by yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) poly(A) polymerase, about 150-nucleotide poly(A) tracts were added specifically to the newly cleaved 3' ends in a cooperative manner. The reconstituted polyadenylation reaction is indicative that authentic cleavage products were generated. Our results not only provide a novel plant pre-mRNA cleavage assay system, but also suggest a cross-kingdom functional complementation of yeast poly(A) polymerase in a plant system.
