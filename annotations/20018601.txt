['20018601', 'A putative phosphatase, LSF1 (for LIKE SEX4; previously PTPKIS2), is closely  related in sequence and structure to STARCH-EXCESS4 (SEX4), an enzyme necessary  for the removal of phosphate groups from starch polymers during starch  degradation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves at night. We show that  LSF1 is also required for starch degradation: lsf1 mutants, like sex4 mutants,  have substantially more starch in their leaves than wild-type plants throughout  the diurnal cycle. LSF1 is chloroplastic and is located on the surface of starch  granules. lsf1 and sex4 mutants show similar, extensive changes relative to  wild-type plants in the expression of sugar-sensitive genes. However, although  LSF1 and SEX4 are probably both involved in the early stages of starch  degradation, we show that LSF1 neither catalyzes the same reaction as SEX4 nor  mediates a sequential step in the pathway. Evidence includes the contents and  metabolism of phosphorylated glucans in the single mutants. The sex4 mutant  accumulates soluble phospho-oligosaccharides undetectable in wild-type plants and  is deficient in a starch granule-dephosphorylating activity present in wild-type  plants. The lsf1 mutant displays neither of these phenotypes. The phenotype of  the lsf1/sex4 double mutant also differs from that of both single mutants in  several respects. We discuss the possible role of the LSF1 protein in starch  degradation.', '2010 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.109.148981', 'Smith']
