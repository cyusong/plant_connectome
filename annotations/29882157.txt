The Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake system in Arabidopsis roots is Gd<sup>3+</sup>- and Fe<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive, and responds to a changing Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration within 1 h with the participation of AtMRS2 transporters. Magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) absorption and the mechanism regulating its activity have not been clarified yet. To address these issues, it is necessary to reveal the characteristics of Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake in roots. Therefore, we first investigated the Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake characteristics in roots of 1-week-old Arabidopsis plants using <sup>28</sup>Mg. The Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake system in roots was up-regulated within 1 h in response to the low Mg<sup>2+</sup> condition. This induction was inhibited in Arabidopsis "mitochondrial RNA splicing 2/magnesium transport" mutants atmrs2-4/atmgt6 and atmrs2-7/atmgt7, while the expression of AtMRS2-4/AtMGT6 and AtMRS2-7/AtMGT7 genes in the Arabidopsis wild-type was not responsive to Mg<sup>2+</sup> conditions. In addition, the Mg deficiency-induced Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake system was shut-down within 5 min when Mg<sup>2+</sup> was resupplied to the environment. An inhibition study showed that the constitutive mechanism functioning in Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake under Mg<sup>2+</sup> sufficient conditions was sensitive to a number of divalent and trivalent cations, particularly Gd<sup>3+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, but not to K<sup>+</sup>.
