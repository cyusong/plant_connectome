['21693514', 'Seedling establishment is a crucial phase during plant development when the  germinating heterotrophic embryo switches to autotrophic growth and development.  Positive regulators of embryonic development need to be turned off, while the  cell cycle machinery is activated to allow cell cycle entry and organ primordia  initiation. However, it is not yet understood how the molecular mechanisms  responsible for the onset of cell division, metabolism changes and cell  differentiation are coordinated during this transition. Here, we demonstrate that  the Arabidopsis thaliana RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED protein (RBR) ortholog of the  animal tumor suppressor retinoblastoma (pRB) not only controls the expression of  cell cycle-related genes, but is also required for persistent shut-down of late  embryonic genes by increasing their histone H3K27 trimethylation. Seedlings with  reduced RBR function arrest development after germination, and stimulation with  low amounts of sucrose induces transcription of late embryonic genes and causes  ectopic cell division. Our results suggest a model in which RBR acts  antagonistically to sucrose by negatively regulating the cell cycle and  repressing embryonic genes. Thus, RBR is a positive regulator of the  developmental switch from embryonic heterotrophic growth to autotrophic growth.  This establishes RBR as a new integrator of metabolic and developmental  decisions.', '2011 Jul', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.060830', 'Gruissem']
