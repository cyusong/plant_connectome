Blueberry (<i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i> and hybrids) is an autotetraploid crop whose commercial relevance has been growing steadily during the last 20 years. However, the ever-increasing cost of labor for hand-picking blueberry is one main constraint in competitive marketing of the fruit. Machine harvestability is, therefore, a key trait for the blueberry industry. Understanding the genetic architecture of traits related to machine harvestability through Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping is the first step toward implementation of molecular breeding for faster genetic gains. Despite recent advances in software development for autotetraploid genetic mapping, a high-resolution map is still not available for blueberry. In this study, we crafted a map for autotetraploid low-chill highbush blueberry containing 11,292 SNP markers and a total size of 1,953.97 cM (average density of 5.78 markers/cM). This map was subsequently used to perform QTL analyses in 2-year field trials for a trait crucial to machine harvesting: fruit firmness. Preliminary insights were also sought for single evaluations of firmness retention after cold storage, and fruit detachment force traits. Significant QTL peaks were identified for all the traits and overlapping QTL intervals were detected for firmness across the years. We found low-to-moderate QTL effects explaining the phenotypic variance, which suggest a quantitative nature of these traits. The QTL intervals were further speculated for putative gene repertoire. Altogether, our findings provide the basis for future fine-mapping and molecular breeding efforts for machine harvesting in blueberry.
