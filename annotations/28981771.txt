Perturbation of cellulose synthesis in plants triggers stress responses, including growth retardation, mediated by the cell wall integrity-sensing receptor-like kinase (RLK) THESEUS1 (THE1). The analysis of two alleles carrying T-DNA insertions at comparable positions has led to conflicting conclusions concerning the impact of THE1 signaling on growth. Here we confirm that, unlike the1-3 and other the1 alleles in which cellular responses to genetic or pharmacological inhibition of cellulose synthesis are attenuated, the1-4 showed enhanced responses, including growth inhibition, ectopic lignification, and stress gene expression. Both the1-3 and the1-4 express a transcript encoding a predicted membrane-associated truncated protein lacking the kinase domain. However, the1-3, in contrast to the1-4, strongly expresses antisense transcripts, which are expected to prevent the expression of the truncated protein as suggested by the genetic interactions between the two alleles. Seedlings overexpressing such a truncated protein react to isoxaben treatment similarly to the1-4 and the full-length THE overexpressor. We conclude that the1-4 is a hypermorphic allele; that THE1 signaling upon cell wall damage has a negative impact on cell expansion; and that caution is required when interpreting the phenotypic effects of T-DNA insertions in RLK genes.
