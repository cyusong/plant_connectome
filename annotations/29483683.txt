Adenine base editors (ABEs), composed of an engineered deaminase and a catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9 variant, are powerful new tools for targeted base editing in cells and organisms. Together with cytosine base editors (CBEs), ABEs enable single-nucleotide conversions cleanly, efficiently and reversibly without double-stranded DNA cleavage, advancing genome editing in a new dimension.
