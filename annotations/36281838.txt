Being an important carbon (C) sink, phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) has been investigated in various soil-plant systems. However, the effects of environmental factors (i.e., drought) on phytoliths, including altered deposition in plant tissues, morphological variation, and amounts of carbon occluded within phytoliths, are less studied. In this study, we analyzed the monthly variations of phytolith production and PhytOC in the leaves of Dendrocalamus ronganensis grown on a karst mountain in southwestern China during a drought year. This study thus sought to understand the effects of drought on phytolith formation, morphological variations and carbon sequestration within phytoliths in plants. Our results showed that the phytolith assemblages and PhytOC between new and old leaves differed significantly and varied with plant growth stages. The average PhytOC values of old leaves and tip leaves were 3.2% and 2.2%, respectively. In particular, both PhytOC and proportions of ELONGATE, BULLIFORM FLABELLATE, and STOMA phytoliths in tip leaves significantly decreased from September to January the following year because of drought effects. This study suggests that PhytOC in plants varies between phytolith morphotypes and is significantly affected by plant growth stage and hydrologic conditions. This indicates that we can improve the efficiency of phytolith carbon sequestration in plants by improving the soil water conditions required for plant growth.
