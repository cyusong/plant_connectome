Plant metabolism, including primary metabolism such as tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, shikimate and amino acid pathways as well as specialized metabolism such as biosynthesis of phenolics, alkaloids and saponins, contributes to plant survival, growth, development and interactions with the environment. To this end, these metabolic processes are tightly and finely regulated transcriptionally, post-transcriptionally, translationally and post-translationally in response to different growth and developmental stages as well as the constantly changing environment. In this review, we summarize and describe the current knowledge of the regulation of plant metabolism by alternative splicing, a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that generates multiple protein isoforms from a single gene by using alternative splice sites during splicing. Numerous genes in plant metabolism have been shown to be alternatively spliced under different developmental stages and stress conditions. In particular, alternative splicing serves as a regulatory mechanism to fine-tune plant metabolism by altering biochemical activities, interaction and subcellular localization of proteins encoded by splice isoforms of various genes.
