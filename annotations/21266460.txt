['21266460', 'Protein translocation across the inner envelope of plastids is mediated by the  TIC (translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts) protein  translocation machinery. Tic20 has been shown to function as a central component  of TIC machinery. The Arabidopsis genome encodes four Tic20 homologous proteins,  AtTic20-I, AtTic20-II, AtTIC20-IV and AtTic20-V, among which only AtTic20-I has  been extensively characterized and demonstrated to be essential for protein  import into chloroplasts. AtTic20-I is more closely related to AtTic20-IV than to  AtTic20-II or AtTic20-V, whereas AtTic20-II and AtTic20-V show higher  similarities to each other than to AtTic20-I or AtTic20-IV. Here, we show that  AtTic20-IV is expressed mainly in roots whereas AtTic20-I is more abundant in  shoots than in roots. Although AtTic20-IV is dispensable for viability in the  wild-type background, interestingly, expression of AtTic20-IV is markedly  elevated in both shoots and roots in the tic20-I knockout mutant that exhibits  severe albino and seedling-lethal phenotypes. The albino tic20-I seedlings do not  accumulate any of the photosynthetic proteins analyzed, but the plastids can  still import non-photosynthetic housekeeping proteins. This residual import  ability of the tic20-I mutant can be attributed to partial compensation by the  elevated expression of AtTic20-IV, since a double knockout mutant of AtTic20-I  and AtTic20-IV exhibits more severe embryonic lethality. Further overexpression  of AtTic20-IV in the tic20-I mutant can only marginally rescue the accumulation  of photosynthetic proteins in the albino seedlings. These data demonstrate an  absolute requirement of at least one of the two closely related Tic20 proteins in  protein translocation across the inner envelope of plastids and also suggest  their distinct substrate preferences.', '2011 Mar', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcr010', 'Nakai']
