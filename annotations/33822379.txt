The widespread ascomycetous fungus Diplodia pinea is a latent, necrotrophic pathogen in Pinus species causing severe damages and world-wide economic losses. However, the interactions between pine hosts and virulent D. pinea are largely not understood. In the present study, systemic defence responses were investigated in non-inoculated, asymptomatic needles and roots of D. pinea infected saplings of two P. sylvestris provenances under controlled greenhouse conditions. Here, we show that D. pinea infection induced a multitude of systemic responses of the phytohormone profiles and metabolic traits. Shared systemic responses of both pine provenances in needles and roots included increased abscisic acid and jasmonic acid levels. Exclusively in the roots of both provenances, enhanced salicylic acid and reduced indole-3-acetic acid levels, structural biomass, and elevated activities of anti-oxidative enzymes were observed. Despite these similarities, the two pine provenances investigated different significantly in the systemic responses of both, phytohormone profiles and metabolic traits in needles and roots. However, the different systemic responses did not prevent subsequent destruction of non-inoculated needles, but rather prevented damage to the roots. Our results provide a detailed view on systemic defence mechanisms of pine hosts that are of particular significance for the selection of provenances with improved defence capacity.
