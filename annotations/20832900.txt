['20832900', 'RIP3 belongs to a group of recently identified proteins, classified as the  ICR/RIP family whose members were described to interact with Rho proteins of  plants (ROPs). Our in vivo and in vitro data demonstrate that RIP3 is a true ROP  effector, interacting specifically with the active form of ROPs. We found that  RIP3 has properties and cellular roles different from the previously described  RIP family member ICR1/RIP1. We show that RIP3 is localized at microtubules and  interacts with the kinesin-13 family member AtKinesin-13A, suggesting a role for  RIP3 in microtubule reorganization and a possible function in ROP-regulated polar  growth.', '2010 Dec', 'Eur J Cell Biol', '10.1016/j.ejcb.2010.08.003', 'Berken']
