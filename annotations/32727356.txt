The glyoxylate reductase (GR) multigene family has been described in various plant species, their isoforms show different biochemical features in plants. However, few studies have addressed the biological roles of GR isozymes, especially for rice. Here, we report a detailed analysis of the enzymatic properties and physiological roles of OsGR1 and OsGR2 in rice. The results showed that both enzymes prefer NADPH to NADH as cofactor, and the NADPH-dependent glyoxylate reducing activity represents the major GR activity in various tissues and at different growth stages; and OsGR1 proteins were more abundant than OsGR2, which is also a major contributor to total GR activities. By generating and characterizing various OsGR-genetically modified rice lines, including overexpression, single and double-knockout lines, we found that no phenotypic differences occur among the various transgenic lines under normal growth conditions, while a dwarfish growth phenotype was noticed under photorespiration-promoted conditions. Our results suggest that OsGR1 and OsGR2, with distinct enzymatic characteristics, function redundantly in detoxifying glyoxylate in rice plants under normal growth conditions, whereas both are simultaneously required under high photorespiration conditions.
