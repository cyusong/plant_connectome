1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase is a key enzyme in the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis in higher plants. To investigate the catalytic significances of two conserved tyrosine residues, Tyr151 and Tyr152, of a tomato ACC synthase isozyme (LeACS2), five ACC synthase mutants (Y151F, Y151G, Y152F, Y152G, and Y151F/Y152F) were constructed and over-expressed in Escherichia coli. Subsequent kinetic analysis indicated that these point mutations in mutants Y152F, Y152G, and Y151F/Y152F, either reduced the catalytic efficiency more than 98% or fully inactivated ACC synthase, while Y151F and Y151G mutants reduced the enzymatic activities by 27% and 83%, respectively. It is therefore concluded that Tyr152, especially its hydroxyl group, plays an essential role in the catalysis of ACC synthase. Thus, a revised catalytic model is hereby proposed for functional ACC synthase.

LeACS2: !synthesizes! ACC
Y151F/Y152F: !inactivates! ACC synthase
Y151F: !reduces! enzymatic activity
Y151G: !reduces! enzymatic activity
Y152F: !reduces! catalytic efficiency
Y152G: !reduces! catalytic efficiency
Tyr152: !essential for! catalysis
