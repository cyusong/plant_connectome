Identifying regulatory elements and revealing their role in gene expression regulation remains a central goal of plant genome research. We exploited the detailed genomic sequencing information of a large number of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accessions to characterize known and to identify novel cis-regulatory elements in gene promoter regions of Arabidopsis by relying on conservation as the hallmark signal of functional relevance. Based on the genomic layout and the obtained density profiles of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in sequence regions upstream of transcription start sites, the average length of promoter regions in Arabidopsis could be established at 500 bp. Genes associated with high degrees of variability of their respective upstream regions are preferentially involved in environmental response and signaling processes, while low levels of promoter SNP density are common among housekeeping genes. Known cis-elements were found to exhibit a decreased SNP density than sequence regions not associated with known motifs. For 15 known cis-element motifs, strong positional preferences relative to the transcription start site were detected based on their promoter SNP density profiles. Five novel candidate cis-element motifs were identified as consensus motifs of 17 sequence hexamers exhibiting increased sequence conservation combined with evidence of positional preferences, annotation information, and functional relevance for inducing correlated gene expression. Our study demonstrates that the currently available resolution of SNP data offers novel ways for the identification of functional genomic elements and the characterization of gene promoter sequences.
