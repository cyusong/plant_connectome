Calcineurin B-like (CBL) and CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK) play a crucial role in biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, the roles of different CIPKs in biotic and abiotic stress responses are less well characterized. In this study, we identified a mutation leading to an early protein termination of the maize CIPK gene ZmCIPK42 that undergoes a G to A mutation at the coding region via searching for genes involved in salt stress tolerance and ion homeostasis from maize with querying the EMS mutant library of maize B73. The mutant zmcipk42 plants have less branched tassel and impaired salt stress tolerance at the seedling stage. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that ZmCIPK42was expressed in diverse tissues and was induced by NaCl stress. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified a proteinase inhibitor (ZmMPI) as well as calcineurin B-like protein 1 and protein 4 (ZmCBL1, ZmCBL4) as interaction partners of ZmCIPK42. These interactions were further confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation in plant cells. Moreover, over-expressing ZmCIPK42 resulted in enhanced tolerance to high salinity in both maize and Arabidopsis. These findings suggest that ZmCIPK42 is a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance and is a promising candidate gene to improve salt stress tolerance in maize through genetic manipulation.
