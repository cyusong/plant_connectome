The MultiSite Gateway cloning system, based on site-specific recombination, enables the assembly of multiple DNA fragments in predefined order, orientation, and frame register. To streamline the construction of recombinant genes for functional analysis in plants, we have built a collection of 36 reference Gateway entry clones carrying promoters, terminators, and reporter genes, as well as elements of the LhG4/LhGR two-component system. This collection obeys simple engineering rules. The genetic elements (parts) are designed in a standard format. They are interchangeable, fully documented, and can be combined at will according to the desired output. We also took advantage of the MultiSite Gateway recombination sites to create vectors in which two or three genes can be cloned simultaneously in separate expression cassettes. To illustrate the flexibility of these core resources for the construction of a wide variety of plant transformation vectors, we generated various transgenes encoding fluorescent proteins and tested their activity in plant cells. The structure and sequence of all described plasmids are accessible online at http://www.psb.ugent.be/gateway/. All accessions can be requested via the same Web site.
