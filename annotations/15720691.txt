* Intergeneric hybrids between Lolium multiflorum and Festuca pratensis (Lm/Fp) and their derivatives exhibit a unique combination of genetic and cytogenetic characteristics: chromosomes undergo a high frequency of homoeologous recombination at meiosis; the chromosomes of the two species can easily be discriminated by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH); recombination occurs along the entire length of homoeologous bivalents; a high frequency of marker polymorphism is observed between the two species. * This combination of characters has been used to transfer and isolate a F. pratensis chromosome segment carrying a mutant 'stay-green' gene conferring a disrupted leaf senescence phenotype into L. multiflorum. * The genetic location within the introgressed F. pratensis segment of the senescence gene has been mapped using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), and F. pratensis-specific AFLP markers closely flanking the green gene have been cloned. * The use of these cloned sequences as markers for the stay-green locus in marker-assisted selection programmes has been tested. The potential application of Lm/Fp introgressions as a tool for the map-based cloning of introgressed Fp genes is discussed.
