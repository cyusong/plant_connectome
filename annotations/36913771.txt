We have recently demonstrated that the cellulose breakdown product cellotriose is a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) which induces responses related to the integrity of the cell wall. Activation of downstream responses requires the Arabidopsis malectin domain-containing CELLOOLIGOMER RECEPTOR KINASE1 (CORK1)<sup>1</sup>. The cellotriose/CORK1 pathway induces immune responses, including NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species production, mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/6 phosphorylation-dependent defense gene activation, and the biosynthesis of defense hormones. However, apoplastic accumulation of cell wall breakdown products should also activate cell wall repair mechanisms. We demonstrate that the phosphorylation pattern of numerous proteins involved in the accumulation of an active cellulose synthase complex in the plasma membrane and those for protein trafficking to and within the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network (TGN) are altered within minutes after cellotriose application to Arabidopsis roots. The phosphorylation pattern of enzymes involved in hemicellulose or pectin biosynthesis and the transcript levels for polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes responded barely to cellotriose treatments. Our data show that the phosphorylation pattern of proteins involved in cellulose biosynthesis and <i>trans</i>-Golgi trafficking is an early target of the cellotriose/CORK1 pathway.
