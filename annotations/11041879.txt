['11041879', 'We have established an Arabidopsis protoplast model system to study plant cell  death signaling. The fungal toxin fumonisin B1 (FB1) induces apoptosis-like  programmed cell death (PCD) in wild-type protoplasts. FB1, however, only  marginally affects the viability of protoplasts isolated from transgenic NahG  plants, in which salicylic acid (SA) is metabolically degraded; from pad4-1  mutant plants, in which an SA amplification mechanism is thought to be impaired;  or from jar1-1 or etr1-1 mutant plants, which are insensitive to jasmonate (JA)  or ethylene (ET), respectively. FB1 susceptibility of wild-type protoplasts  decreases in the dark, as does the cellular content of phenylalanine  ammonia-lyase, a light-inducible enzyme involved in SA biosynthesis.  Interestingly, however, FB1-induced PCD does not require the SA signal  transmitter NPR1, given that npr1-1 protoplasts display wild-type FB1  susceptibility. Arabidopsis cpr1-1, cpr6-1, and acd2-2 protoplasts, in which the  SA signaling pathway is constitutively activated, exhibit increased  susceptibility to FB1. The cpr6-1 and acd2-2 mutants also constitutively express  the JA and ET signaling pathways, but only the acd2-2 protoplasts undergo PCD in  the absence of FB1. These results demonstrate that FB1 killing of Arabidopsis is  light dependent and requires SA-, JA-, and ET-mediated signaling pathways as well  as one or more unidentified factors activated by FB1 and the acd2-2 mutation.', '2000 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.10.1823', 'Ausubel']
