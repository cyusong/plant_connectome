Light stress is one of the important stresses for winter survival in evergreens, especially for plants with broad leaves, like evergreen rhododendrons. Photoprotection has been shown to upregulate dramatically in rhododendrons during winter, but whether it directly contributes to enhancing the freezing tolerance is still unknown. In this study, we found that the expression and circadian rhythm of an early light-induced protein (ELIP)-RhELIP3-which exerts photoprotection in Rhododendron 'Elsie Lee', could be impacted by both photoperiod and low temperature, with low temperature being the predominant inducer. Arabidopsis overexpressing RhELIP3 displayed significantly stronger freezing tolerance and better photosystem II function after a 3-day recovery from freezing treatment. Moreover, RhHY5 binds with the RhELIP3 promoter to activate its expression. Arabidopsis overexpressing RhHY5 exhibited stronger freezing tolerance and better photosystem II function. AtELIP1 and AtELIP2 were significantly induced in RhHY5-overexpressed Arabidopsis at low temperatures. We also discovered that RhBBX24 binds directly to RhELIP3 promoter and suppresses its expression. RhBBX24 can also interact with RhHY5 and inhibit the interaction of RhHY5-RhELIP3. RhELIP3, RhHY5, and RhBBX24 exhibited similar circadian rhythms under low temperature with short period. Overall, our investigation highlights that photoprotection is involved in improving the freezing tolerance of evergreen rhododendrons.
