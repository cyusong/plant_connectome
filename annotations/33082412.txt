['33082412', 'B-box transcription factors (BBXs) are important regulators of flowering,  photomorphogenesis, shade-avoidance, abiotic and biotic stresses and plant  hormonal pathways. In Arabidopsis, 32 BBX proteins have been identified and  classified into five groups based on their structural domains. Little is known  about the fifth group members (BBX26-BBX32) and the detailed molecular mechanisms  relevant to their functions. Here we identified B-box transcription factor 28  (BBX28) that interacts with Constans (CO), a transcriptional activator of  Flowering Locus T (FT). Overexpressing BBX28 leads to late flowering with  dramatically decreased FT transcription, and bbx28 deficient mutant displays a  weak early flowering phenotype under long days (LD), indicating that BBX28 plays  a negative and redundant role in flowering under LD. Additionally, the  interaction between BBX28 and CO decreases the recruitment of CO to FT locus  without affecting the transcriptional activation activity of CO. Moreover, the  N-terminal cysteines, especially those within the B-box domain, are indispensable  for the heterodimerization between BBX28 and CO and activation of CO on FT  transcription. Genetic evidences show that the later flowering caused by BBX28  overexpression is compromised by CO ectopic expression. Collectively, these  results supported that BBX28 functions with CO and FT to negatively regulate  Arabidopsis flowering, in which the N-terminal conserved cysteines of BBX28 might  play a central role.', '2020 Oct 20', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/s41598-020-74445-7', 'Fang']
