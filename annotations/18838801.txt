['18838801', 'More than 1,600 genes encoding transcription factors have been identified in the  Arabidopsis genome sequence, but their physiological functions are not yet fully  understood. In this study, a small subfamily of single-MYB transcription factor  genes, designated RSM1, RSM2, RSM3 and RSM4 (RADIALIS-LIKE SANT/MYB 1-4), was  characterized. Here, we mainly examined the RSM1 gene, and found that it appears  to play a role in close connection with the HLS1 (HOOKLESS 1) gene during early  morphogenesis. Etiolated seedlings overexpressing RSM1 showed several phenotypes  similar to those of hls1-1, viz., lack of apical hooks with short hypocotyls, and  a defect in gravitropism. Furthermore, both RSM1-ox and hls1-1 seedlings were  hypersensitive to red light during early photomorphogenesis, displaying shorter  hypocotyls than wild-type seedlings. The histochemical profile of the DR5::GUS  auxin-reporter in the RMS1-ox seedlings was considerably different from that in  the wild-type seedlings. These results are discussed in the context of the  possibility that RSM1 is implicated in HLS1-mediated auxin signaling, which is  responsible for regulation of the early photomorphogenesis of Arabidopsis  thaliana.', '2008 Oct', 'Biosci Biotechnol Biochem', '10.1271/bbb.80348', 'Mizuno']
