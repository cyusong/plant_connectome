The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a particularly important model organism for the study of photosynthesis since this alga can grow heterotrophically, and mutants in photosynthesis are therefore conditional rather than lethal. The recently developed tools for genomic analyses of this organism have allowed us to identify most of the genes required for chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis and to examine their phylogenetic relationships with homologous genes from vascular plants, other algae, and cyanobacteria. Comparative genome analyses revealed some intriguing features associated with pigment biosynthesis in C. reinhardtii; in some cases, there are additional conserved domains in the algal and plant but not the cyanobacterial proteins that may directly influence their activity, assembly, or regulation. For some steps in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, we found multiple gene copies encoding putative isozymes. Phylogenetic studies, theoretical evaluation of gene expression through analysis of expressed sequence tag data and codon bias of each gene, enabled us to generate hypotheses concerning the function and regulation of the individual genes, and to propose targets for future research. We have also used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine the effect of low fluence light on the level of mRNA accumulation encoding key proteins of the biosynthetic pathways and examined differential expression of those genes encoding isozymes that function in the pathways. This work is directing us toward the exploration of the role of specific photoreceptors in the biosynthesis of pigments and the coordination of pigment biosynthesis with the synthesis of proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus.
