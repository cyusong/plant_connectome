['17652352', 'The Arabidopsis genome contains three ERECTA-family genes, ERECTA (ER),  ERECTA-LIKE 1 (ERL1) and ERL2 that encode leucine-rich repeat receptor-like  kinases. This gene family acts synergistically to coordinate cell proliferation  and growth during above-ground organogenesis with the major player, ER, masking  the loss-of-function phenotypes of the other two members. To uncover the specific  developmental consequence and minimum threshold requirement for signaling,  ER-family gene function was successively eliminated. We report here that ERL2 is  haploinsufficient for maintaining female fertility in the absence of ER and ERL1.  Ovules of the haploinsufficient er-105 erl1-2 erl2-1/+ mutant exhibit abnormal  development with reduced cell proliferation in the integuments and gametophyte  abortion. Our analysis indicates that progression of integument growth requires  ER-family signaling in a dosage-dependent manner and that transcriptional  compensation among ER-family members occurs to maintain the required signaling  threshold. The specific misregulation of cyclin A genes in the er-105 erl1-2  erl2-1/+ mutant suggests that downstream targets of the ER-signaling pathway  might include these core cell-cycle regulators. Finally, genetic interaction of  the ER family and the WOX-family gene, PFS2, reveals their contribution to  integument development through interrelated mechanisms.', '2007 Sep', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.004788', 'Torii']
