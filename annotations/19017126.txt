During the last ice age, CO2 concentration ([CO2]) was 180-200 micromol/mol compared with the modern value of 380 micromol/mol, and global temperatures were approximately 8 degrees C cooler. Relatively little is known about the responses of C3 and C4 species to long-term exposure to glacial conditions. Here Abutilon theophrasti Medik. (C3) and Amaranthus retroflexus L. (C4) were grown at 200 micromol/mol CO2 with current (30/24 degrees C) and glacial (22/16 degrees C) temperatures for 22 d. Overall, the C4 species exhibited a large growth advantage over the C3 species at low [CO2]. However, this advantage was reduced at low temperature, where the C4 species produced 5 x the total mass of the C3 species versus 14 x at the high temperature. This difference was due to a reduction in C4 growth at low temperature, since the C3 species exhibited similar growth between temperatures. Physiological differences between temperatures were not detected for either species, although photorespiration/net photosynthesis was reduced in the C3 species grown at low temperature, suggesting evidence of improved carbon balance at this treatment. This system suggests that C4 species had a growth advantage over C3 species during low [CO2] of the last ice age, although concurrent reductions in temperatures may have reduced this advantage.

C3: !exhibited similar growth between temperatures! C4
C4: !exhibited a large growth advantage over the C3 species at low [CO2]! Temperature
C3: !photorespiration/net photosynthesis was reduced! Low Temperature
C4: !growth was reduced! Low Temperature
