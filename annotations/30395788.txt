The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)-induced <i>ZmPt9</i> gene is an orthologous to some AM-inducible phosphate (Pi) transporter genes involved in Pi-starvation responses. Promoter GFP assay confirmed its transcript was localized surrounding arbuscule in arbuscule-containing cells. But this gene was not an AM fungi-specific gene. Its function in nonmycorrhizal seedlings was verified through phenotypic analysis of <i>ZmPt9-</i>overexpression <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Overexpression of <i>ZmPt9</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> exhibited increased primary root length and lateral root formation. Furthermore, <i>ZmPt9</i>-overexpression <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants contained more phosphorus (P) than that of wild type. The affection of <i>ZmPt9</i> in nonmycorrhizal <i>Arabidopsis</i> leads to the hypothesis that symbiosis-inducible genes are also involved in root development and Pi accumulation in AM-independent manner.
