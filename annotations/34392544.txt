The coupling between mitochondrial respiration and photosynthesis plays an important role in the energetic physiology of green plants and some secondary-red photosynthetic eukaryotes (diatoms), allowing an efficient CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and optimal growth. Using the flagellate Euglena gracilis, we first tested if photosynthesis-respiration coupling occurs in this species harbouring secondary green plastids (i.e. originated from an endosymbiosis between a green alga and a phagotrophic euglenozoan). Second, we tested how the trophic state (mixotrophy and photoautotrophy) of the cell alters the mechanisms involved in the photosynthesis-respiration coupling. Energetic coupling between photosynthesis and respiration was determined by testing the effect of respiratory inhibitors on photosynthesis, and measuring the simultaneous variation of photosynthesis and respiration rates as a function of temperature (i.e. thermal response curves). The mechanism involved in the photosynthesis-respiration coupling was assessed by combining proteomics, biophysical and cytological analyses. Our work shows that there is photosynthesis-respiration coupling and membrane contacts between mitochondria and chloroplasts in E. gracilis. However, whereas in mixotrophy adjustment of the chloroplast ATP/NADPH ratio drives the interaction, in photoautotrophy the coupling is conditioned by CO<sub>2</sub> limitation and photorespiration. This indicates that maintenance of photosynthesis-respiration coupling, through plastic metabolic responses, is key to E. gracilis functioning under changing environmental conditions.
