['19933100', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) acts in seed dormancy, plant development,  drought tolerance, and adaptive responses to environmental stresses. Structural  mechanisms mediating ABA receptor recognition and signaling remain unknown but  are essential for understanding and manipulating abiotic stress resistance. Here,  we report structures of pyrabactin resistance 1 (PYR1), a prototypical  PYR/PYR1-like (PYL)/regulatory component of ABA receptor (RCAR) protein that  functions in early ABA signaling. The crystallographic structure reveals an  alpha/beta helix-grip fold and homodimeric assembly, verified in vivo by  coimmunoprecipitation. ABA binding within a large internal cavity switches  structural motifs distinguishing ABA-free "open-lid" from ABA-bound "closed-lid"  conformations. Small-angle x-ray scattering suggests that ABA signals by  converting PYR1 to a more compact, symmetric closed-lid dimer. Site-directed PYR1  mutants designed to disrupt hormone binding lose ABA-triggered interactions with  type 2C protein phosphatase partners in planta.', '2009 Dec 4', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1181829', 'Getzoff']
