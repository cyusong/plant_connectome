['19001565', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana resistance gene RPW8 triggers the hypersensitive  response (HR) to restrict powdery mildew infection via the salicylic  acid-dependent signaling pathway. To further understand how RPW8 signaling is  regulated, we have conducted a genetic screen to identify mutations enhancing  RPW8-mediated HR-like cell death (designated erh). Here, we report the isolation  and characterization of the Arabidopsis erh1 mutant, in which the At2g37940 locus  is knocked out by a T-DNA insertion. Loss of function of ERH1 results in  salicylic acid accumulation, enhanced transcription of RPW8 and RPW8-dependent  spontaneous HR-like cell death in leaf tissues, and reduction in plant stature.  Sequence analysis suggests that ERH1 may encode the long-sought Arabidopsis  functional homolog of yeast and protozoan inositolphosphorylceramide synthase  (IPCS), which converts ceramide to inositolphosphorylceramide. Indeed, ERH1 is  able to rescue the yeast aur1 mutant, which lacks the IPCS, and the erh1 mutant  plants display reduced ( approximately 53% of wild type) levels of leaf IPCS  activity, indicating that ERH1 encodes a plant IPCS. Consistent with its  biochemical function, the erh1 mutation causes ceramide accumulation in plants  expressing RPW8. These data reinforce the concept that sphingolipid metabolism  (specifically, ceramide accumulation) plays an important role in modulating plant  programmed cell death associated with defense.', '2008 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.060053', 'Xiao']
