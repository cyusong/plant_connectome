['11844103', "The plant vacuole is a multifunctional organelle which is essential for growth  and development. To visualize the dynamics of plant vacuolar membranes, gamma-TIP  (tonoplast intrinsic protein) was fused to GFP and expressed in Arabidopsis  thaliana. The marker molecule was targeted to the vacuolar membranes in most  tissues, as expected. In rapidly expanding cells, some additional spherical  structures were often observed within the lumen of vacuoles, which emitted strong  fluorescence. To confirm their normal presence, we examined wild-type Arabidopsis  cotyledons by transmission electron microscopy. The metal-contact rapid-freezing  method revealed that the vacuolar lumen of epidermal cells contained many  cytoplasmic projections, which often formed spherical structures (1-3 microm  diameter) consisting of double membranes. Thus we concluded that these structures  are authentic and named them 'bulbs'. Three-dimensional reconstruction from  serial electron microscopic images demonstrates that bulbs are very intricately  folded, but are continuous with the limiting vacuolar membrane. The fluorescence  intensity of bulbs is about threefold higher than that of vacuolar membrane.  GFP-AtRab75c, another marker of the vacuole, did not give fluorescent signals of  bulbs in transgenic plants, but the existence of bulbs was still confirmed by  electron microscopy. These results suggest that bulbs define a subregion in the  continuous vacuolar membrane, where some proteins are concentrated and others  segregated.", '2002 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.0960-7412.2001.01189.x', 'Nakano']
