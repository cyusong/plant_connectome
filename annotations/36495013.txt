Seeds are a major source of nutrients for humans and animal livestock worldwide. With improved living standards, high nutritional quality has become one of the main targets for breeding. Storage protein content in seeds, which is highly variable depending on plant species, serves as a pivotal criterion of seed nutritional quality. In the last few decades, our understanding of the molecular genetics and regulatory mechanisms of storage protein synthesis has greatly advanced. Here, we systematically and comprehensively summarize breakthroughs on the conservation and divergence of storage protein synthesis in dicot and monocot plants. With regard to storage protein accumulation, we discuss evolutionary origins, developmental processes, characteristics of main storage protein fractions, regulatory networks, and genetic modifications. In addition, we discuss potential breeding strategies to improve storage protein accumulation and provide perspectives on some key unanswered problems that need to be addressed.
