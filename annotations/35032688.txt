Southern corn rust (SCR), caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia polysora, is a major threat to maize production worldwide. Efficient breeding and deployment of resistant hybrids are key to achieving durable control of SCR. Here, we report the molecular cloning and characterization of RppC, which encodes an NLR-type immune receptor and is responsible for a major SCR resistance quantitative trait locus. Furthermore, we identified the corresponding avirulence effector, AvrRppC, which is secreted by P. polysora and triggers RppC-mediated resistance. Allelic variation of AvrRppC directly determines the effectiveness of RppC-mediated resistance, indicating that monitoring of AvrRppC variants in the field can guide the rational deployment of RppC-containing hybrids in maize production. Currently, RppC is the most frequently deployed SCR resistance gene in China, and a better understanding of its mode of action is critical for extending its durability.
