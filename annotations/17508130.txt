Neutral/Alkaline invertases are unique to plant and photosynthetic bacteria. The function of Neutral/Alkaline invertases in plant development is not clear so far. In this study, we isolated an Arabidopsis (Col-0) mutant insensitive to osmotic stress-induced inhibition on lateral root growth. Map-based cloning reveals that a neutral invertase gene (AtCYT-INV1) was point-mutated. The mutant Atcyt-inv1 showed short primary root, smaller size of leaves and siliques, and promotion of the reproductive compared to the wild type (WT). Carbohydrate measurement showed that sucrose is accumulated and glucose is reduced in the mutant Atcyt-inv1 under normal and 3% mannitol treatments. Taken together, AtCYT-INV1 plays multiple roles in plant development and is involved in osmotic stress-induced inhibition on lateral root growth by controlling the concentration of hexose in cells.
