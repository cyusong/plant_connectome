['19513241', 'In the Arabidopsis hypocotyl, stomata develop only from a set of epidermal cell  files. Previous studies have identified several negative regulators of stomata  formation. Such regulators also trigger non-hair cell fate in the root. Here, it  is shown that TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) positively regulates CAPRICE (CPC) expression  in differentiating stomaless-forming cell files, and that the CPC protein might  move to the nucleus of neighbouring stoma-forming cells, where it promotes  stomata formation in a redundant manner with TRIPTYCHON (TRY). Unexpectedly, the  CPC protein was also localized in the nucleus and peripheral cytoplasm of  hypocotyl fully differentiated epidermal cells, suggesting that CPC plays an  additional role to those related to stomata formation. These results identify CPC  and TRY as positive regulators of stomata formation in the embryonic stem, which  increases the similarity between the genetic control of root hair and stoma cell  fate determination.', '2008 Dec', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.3.12.6254', 'Serna']
