Abiotic and biotic factors induce oxidative stress involving the production and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This review is a survey of well-known and possible roles of serine-threonine protein phosphatases in plant oxidative stress signaling, with special emphasis on PP2A. ROS mediated signaling involves three interrelated pathways: (i) perception of extracellular ROS triggers signal transduction pathways, leading to DNA damage and/or the production of antioxidants; (ii) external signals induce intracellular ROS generation that triggers the relevant signaling pathways and (iii) external signals mediate protein phosphorylation dependent signaling pathway(s), leading to the expression of ROS producing enzymes like NADPH oxidases. All pathways involve inactivation of serine-threonine protein phosphatases. The metal dependent phosphatase PP2C has a negative regulatory function during ABA mediated ROS signaling. PP2A is the most abundant protein phosphatase in eukaryotic cells. Inhibitors of PP2A exert a ROS inducing activity as well and we suggest that there is a direct relationship between these two effects of drugs. We present current findings and hypotheses regarding PP2A-ROS signaling connections related to all three ROS signaling pathways and anticipate future research directions for this field. These mechanisms have implications in the understanding of stress tolerance of vascular plants, having applications regarding crop improvement.
