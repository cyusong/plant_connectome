['14592967', 'The Arabidopsis protein RPM1 activates disease resistance in response to  Pseudomonas syringae proteins targeted to the inside of the host cell via the  bacterial type III delivery system. We demonstrate that specific mutations in the  ATP-binding domain of a single Arabidopsis cytosolic HSP90 isoform compromise  RPM1 function. These mutations do not affect the function of related disease  resistance proteins. RPM1 associates with HSP90 in plant cells. The Arabidopsis  proteins RAR1 and SGT1 are required for the action of many R proteins, and  display some structural similarity to HSP90 co-chaperones. Each associates with  HSP90 in plant cells. Our data suggest that (i) RPM1 is an HSP90 client protein;  and (ii) RAR1 and SGT1 may function independently as HSP90 cofactors. Dynamic  interactions among these proteins can regulate RPM1 stability and function,  perhaps similarly to the formation and regulation of animal steroid receptor  complexes.', '2003 Nov 3', 'EMBO J', '10.1093/emboj/cdg547', 'Dangl']
