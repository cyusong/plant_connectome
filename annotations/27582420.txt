Comparative phylogenomics offers an opportunity to identify candidate genes associated with these complex traits. This approach initially developed in prokaryotes consists in looking at shared coevolution between genes and traits. It thus requires a precise reconstruction of the trait evolution, a large genomic sampling in the clades of interest and an accurate definition of orthogroups. Recently, with the growing body of sequenced plant genomes, comparative genomics has been successfully applied to plants to study the widespread arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Here I will use these findings to illustrate the main principles of comparative phylogenomic approaches and propose directions to improve our understanding of symbiotic associations.
