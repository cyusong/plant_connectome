Vascular wilt bacteria such as <i>Pantoea stewartii</i>, the causal agent of Stewart's bacterial wilt of maize (SW), are destructive pathogens that are difficult to control. These bacteria colonize the xylem, where they form biofilms that block sap flow leading to characteristic wilting symptoms. Heritable forms of SW resistance exist and are used in maize breeding programs but the underlying genes and mechanisms are mostly unknown. Here, we show that seedlings of maize inbred lines with <i>pan1</i> mutations are highly resistant to SW. However, current evidence suggests that other genes introgressed along with <i>pan1</i> are responsible for resistance. Genomic analyses of <i>pan1</i> lines were used to identify candidate resistance genes. In-depth comparison of <i>P. stewartii</i> interaction with susceptible and resistant maize lines revealed an enhanced vascular defense response in <i>pan1</i> lines characterized by accumulation of electron-dense materials in xylem conduits visible by electron microscopy. We propose that this vascular defense response restricts <i>P. stewartii</i> spread through the vasculature, reducing both systemic bacterial colonization of the xylem network and consequent wilting. Though apparently unrelated to the resistance phenotype of <i>pan1</i> lines, we also demonstrate that the effector WtsE is essential for <i>P. stewartii</i> xylem dissemination, show evidence for a nutritional immunity response to <i>P. stewartii</i> that alters xylem sap composition, and present the first analysis of maize transcriptional responses to <i>P. stewartii</i> infection.
