<i>Brassica oleracea</i> is an agronomically important species of the <i>Brassicaceae</i> family, including several nutrient-rich vegetables grown and consumed across the continents. But its sustainability is heavily constrained by a range of destructive pathogens, among which, clubroot disease, caused by a biotrophic protist <i>Plasmodiophora brassicae</i>, has caused significant yield and economic losses worldwide, thereby threatening global food security. To counter the pathogen attack, it demands a better understanding of the complex phenomenon of Brassica-<i>P. brassicae</i> pathosystem at the physiological, biochemical, molecular, and cellular levels. In recent years, multiple omics technologies with high-throughput techniques have emerged as successful in elucidating the responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In <i>Brassica</i> spp., omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, ncRNAomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are well documented, allowing us to gain insights into the dynamic changes that transpired during host-pathogen interactions at a deeper level. So, it is critical that we must review the recent advances in omics approaches and discuss how the current knowledge in multi-omics technologies has been able to breed high-quality clubroot-resistant <i>B. oleracea</i>. This review highlights the recent advances made in utilizing various omics approaches to understand the host resistance mechanisms adopted by Brassica crops in response to the <i>P. brassicae</i> attack. Finally, we have discussed the bottlenecks and the way forward to overcome the persisting knowledge gaps in delivering solutions to breed clubroot-resistant Brassica crops in a holistic, targeted, and precise way.
