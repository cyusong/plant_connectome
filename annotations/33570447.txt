Drought is one of the main abiotic factors that affect agricultural productivity, jeopardizing food security. Modern biotechnology is a useful tool for the generation of stress-tolerant crops, but its release and field-testing involves complex regulatory frameworks. However, gene editing technology mediated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a suitable strategy for plant breeding, which can lead to precise and specific modifications in the plant genome. The aim of the present work is to produce drought-tolerant plant varieties by modifying the trehalase gene. Furthermore, a new vector platform was developed to edit monocot and dicot genomes, by modifying vectors adding a streptomycin resistance marker for use with the hypervirulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> AGL1 strain. The gRNA design was based on the trehalase sequence in several species of the genus <i>Selaginella</i> that show drought tolerance. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> carrying editions in the trehalase substrate-binding domain showed a higher tolerance to drought stress. In addition, a transient transformation system for gene editing in maize leaves was characterized.
