['21224340', 'Large-scale phenotypic screening presents challenges and opportunities not  encountered in typical forward or reverse genetics projects. We describe a  modular database and laboratory information management system that was  implemented in support of the Chloroplast 2010 Project, an Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) reverse genetics phenotypic screen of more than 5,000  mutants (http://bioinfo.bch.msu.edu/2010_LIMS; www.plastid.msu.edu). The software  and laboratory work environment were designed to minimize operator error and  detect systematic process errors. The database uses Ruby on Rails and Flash  technologies to present complex quantitative and qualitative data and pedigree  information in a flexible user interface. Examples are presented where the  database was used to find opportunities for process changes that improved data  quality. We also describe the use of the data-analysis tools to discover mutants  defective in enzymes of leucine catabolism (heteromeric mitochondrial  3-methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A carboxylase [At1g03090 and At4g34030] and putative  hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase [At2g26800]) based upon a syndrome of  pleiotropic seed amino acid phenotypes that resembles previously described  isovaleryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (At3g45300) mutants. In vitro assay results  support the computational annotation of At2g26800 as  hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase.', '2011 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.110.170118', 'Last']
