Plant somatic cells can reprogram into differentiated embryos through somatic embryogenesis (SE) on the condition of plant growth regulators (PGRs). RNA sequencing analysis was performed to investigate transcriptional profiling on cotton redifferentiated callus that was induced by different auxin types (IAA and 2,4-D), different concentrations (0, 0.025, and 0.05 mg L<sup>-1</sup>), and different incubation times (0, 5, and 20 days). Under the 2,4-D induction effect, signal transduction pathways of plant hormones were significantly enriched in the embryogenic response stage (5 days). These results indicated that auxin signal transduction genes were necessary for the initial response of embryogenic differentiation. In the pre-embryonic initial period (20 days), the photosynthetic pathway was significantly enriched. Most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were downregulated under the induction of 2,4-D. Upon the dose effect of IAA and 2,4-D, respectively, pathways were significantly enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and carbon metabolic pathways. Therefore, primary and secondary metabolism pathways were critical in cotton SE. These results showed that complex synergistic mechanisms involving multiple cellular pathways were the causes of the induction and dose effect of auxin-induced SE. This study reveals a systematic molecular response to auxin signals and reveals the way that regulates embryogenic redifferentiation during cotton SE.
