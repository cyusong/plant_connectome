In the face of increasingly frequent droughts threatening crop performance, ecological theory suggests that higher species diversity may help buffering productivity by making systems more resistant through resource complementarity and more resilient through higher response diversity. However, empirical evidence for these diversity effects under drought stress has remained patchy. In two pot experiments, we explored whether mixing two legume species with a contrasting response to water availability, alsike clover (AC) and black medic (BM), promotes resistance to cumulative drought stress, and resilience of aboveground crop biomass to a transient drought event. The mixture was more productive than the average of the sole crops, and this mixture effect was higher in the non-stressed than in the drought-stressed plants. However, with six levels of constant drought intensities, the mixture effect was not consistently affected by drought level. Response diversity was evident as asynchrony of growth in the two species after the drought event, with BM re-growing faster than AC. Significant resilience to drought was observed in sole AC, i.e., without response diversity. Resilience was larger in AC than in BM and increased from 44 to 72 days after sowing (DAS). The mixture was more resilient than the average resilience of the sole crops at 72 DAS, but it was never more resilient than AC, indicating that resilience is promoted by, but not dependent on response diversity. We conclude that crop diversity may contribute to drought resilience through growth asynchrony, but that species identity plays a crucial role in making systems more drought-resilient.
