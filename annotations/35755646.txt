Grape downy mildew (GDM) disease is a common plant leaf disease, and it causes serious damage to grape production, reducing yield and fruit quality. Traditional manual disease detection relies on farm experts and is often time-consuming. Computer vision technologies and artificial intelligence could provide automatic disease detection for real-time controlling the spread of disease on the grapevine in precision viticulture. To achieve the best trade-off between GDM detection accuracy and speed under natural environments, a deep learning based approach named YOLOv5-CA is proposed in this study. Here coordinate attention (CA) mechanism is integrated into YOLOv5, which highlights the downy mildew disease-related visual features to enhance the detection performance. A challenging GDM dataset was acquired in a vineyard under a nature scene (consisting of different illuminations, shadows, and backgrounds) to test the proposed approach. Experimental results show that the proposed YOLOv5-CA achieved a detection precision of 85.59%, a recall of 83.70%, and a mAP@0.5 of 89.55%, which is superior to the popular methods, including Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, and YOLOv5. Furthermore, our proposed approach with inference occurring at 58.82 frames per second, could be deployed for the real-time disease control requirement. In addition, the proposed YOLOv5-CA based approach could effectively capture leaf disease related visual features resulting in higher GDE detection accuracy. Overall, this study provides a favorable deep learning based approach for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of grape leaf diseases in the field of automatic disease detection.
