The effect of potassium starvation on stomatal conductance was studied in olive trees and sunflower plants, two major crops with greatly differing botanical characteristics. In both species, K(+) starvation inhibited water-stress-induced stomatal closure. In olive trees, potassium starvation favoured stomatal conductance and transpiration, as well as inhibiting shoot growth, in the three cultivars studied: 'Lechín de Granada', 'Arbequina' and 'Chetoui'. However, 'Lechín de Granada' - generally considered more drought-tolerant than 'Arbequina' and 'Chetoui' - proved less susceptible to potassium starvation. Results for olive trees also suggest genetic variability in olive cultivars in relation to potassium requirements for stem growth and the regulation of water transpiration. The results obtained suggest that inhibition of the stomatal closure mechanism produced by moderate potassium starvation is a widespread plant physiological disorder, and may be the cause of tissue dehydration in many water-stressed crops.
