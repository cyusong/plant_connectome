Throughout the evolution of the angiosperm flower, developmental innovations have enabled the modification or elaboration of novel floral organs enabling subsequent diversification and expansion into new niches, for example the formation of novel pollinator relationships. One such developmental innovation is the fusion of various floral organs to form complex structures. Multiple types of floral fusion exist; each type may be the result of different developmental processes and is likely to have evolved multiple times independently across the angiosperm tree of life. The development of fused organs is thought to be mediated by the NAM/CUC3 subfamily of NAC transcription factors, which mediate boundary formation during meristematic development. The goal of this review is to (i) introduce the development of fused floral organs as a key 'developmental innovation', facilitated by a change in the expression of NAM/CUC3 transcription factors; (ii) provide a comprehensive overview of floral fusion phenotypes amongst the angiosperms, defining well-known fusion phenotypes and applying them to a systematic context; and (iii) summarize the current molecular knowledge of this phenomenon, highlighting the evolution of the NAM/CUC3 subfamily of transcription factors implicated in the development of fused organs. The need for a network-based analysis of fusion is discussed, and a gene regulatory network responsible for directing fusion is proposed to guide future research in this area.
