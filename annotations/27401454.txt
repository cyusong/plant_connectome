A novel annotated Chelidonium majus L. transcriptome database composed of 23,004 unique coding sequences allowed to significantly improve the sensitivity of proteomic C. majus assessments, which showed novel defense-related proteins characteristic to its latex. To date, the composition of Chelidonium majus L. milky sap and biosynthesis of its components are poorly characterized. We, therefore, performed de novo sequencing and assembly of C. majus transcriptome using Illumina technology. Approximately, 119 Mb of raw sequence data was obtained. Assembly resulted in 107,088 contigs, with N50 of 1913 bp and N90 of 450 bp. Among 34,965 unique coding sequences (CDS), 23,004 obtained CDS database served as a basis for further proteomic analyses. The database was then used for the identification of proteins from C. majus milky sap, and whole plant extracts analyzed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) approach. Of about 334 different putative proteins were identified in C. majus milky sap and 1155 in C. majus whole plant extract. The quantitative comparative analysis confirmed that C. majus latex contains proteins connected with response to stress conditions and generation of precursor metabolites and energy. Notable proteins characteristic to latex include major latex protein (MLP, presumably belonging to Bet v1-like superfamily), polyphenol oxidase (PPO, which could be responsible for browning of the sap after exposure to air), and enzymes responsible for anthocyanidin, phenylpropanoid, and alkaloid biosynthesis.
