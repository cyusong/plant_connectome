Phytochrome B (phyB) expressed in the epidermis is sufficient to promote red light responses, including the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and hypocotyl negative gravitropism. Nonetheless, the downstream mechanism of epidermal phyB in promoting light responses had been elusive. Here, we mutagenized the epidermis-specific phyB-expressing line (MLB) using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and characterized a novel mutant allele of RRC1 (rrc1-689), which causes reduced epidermal phyB-mediated red light responses. The rrc1-689 mutation increases the alternative splicing of major clock gene transcripts, including PRR7 and TOC1, disrupting the rhythmic expression of the entire clock and clock-controlled genes. Combined with the result that MLB/prr7 exhibits the same red-hyposensitive phenotypes as MLB/rrc1-689, our data support that the circadian clock is required for the ability of epidermal phyB to promote light responses. We also found that, unlike phyB, RRC1 preferentially acts in the endodermis to maintain the circadian rhythm by suppressing the alternative splicing of core clock genes. Together, our results suggest that epidermal phyB requires RRC1 to promote light responses by activating the circadian rhythm in Arabidopsis thaliana.
