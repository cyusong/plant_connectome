Salinity induces myriad of physiological and biochemical perturbations in plants and its amelioration can be attained by the use of potential bacterial synthetic communities. The use of microbial consortia in contrast to single bacterial inoculation can additively enhance stress tolerance and productivity of agricultural crops. In this study, co-inoculation of Pseudomonas koreensis S2CB45 and Microbacterium hydrothermale IC37-36 isolated from arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spore and rice seed endosphere, respectively, were used to evaluate the physiological and biochemical effects on red pepper at two salt concentrations (75 mM and 150 mM). Plant growth promoting characteristics particularly 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity, indole acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinin production were higher during co-culturing compared to the individual bacterial culture. The higher ACC deaminase activity had resulted in 20% and 22% decrease in stress ethylene emission compared to the non-inoculated plants at 75 mM and 150 mM salt stress, respectively. The decline in ethylene emission had eventually reduced ROS accumulation, and the co-inoculated plants had also harbored enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities and higher sugar accumulation compared to the other treatments suggesting enhanced tolerance to salinity. Collectively, these results put forward a novel consortium of bacterial strains that can be used for sustainable agricultural practices against salinity.
