Hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) has a possible signaling role in many developmental and adaptive plant responses, including mitigating the harmful effects of cadmium (Cd) uptake from soil. We used electrophysiological and molecular approaches to understand how H<sub>2</sub> ameliorates Cd toxicity in pak choi (<i>Brassica</i> <i>campestris</i> ssp. <i>chinensis</i>). Exposure of pak choi roots to Cd resulted in a rapid increase in the intracellular H<sub>2</sub> production. Exogenous application of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) resulted in a Cd-tolerant phenotype, with reduced net Cd uptake and accumulation. We showed that this is dependent upon the transport of calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) across the plasma membrane and apoplastic generation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) by respiratory burst oxidase homolog (BcRbohD). The reduction in root Cd uptake was associated with the application of exogenous HRW or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> This reduction was abolished in the <i>iron-regulated transporter1 (Atirt1)</i> mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and pak choi pretreated with HRW showed decreased <i>BcIRT1</i> transcript levels. Roots exposed to HRW had rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and Cd-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> leakage was alleviated. Two Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers, gadolinium ion (Gd<sup>3+</sup>) and lanthanum ion (La<sup>3+</sup>), eliminated the HRW-induced increase in <i>BcRbohD</i> expression, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, and Cd<sup>2+</sup> influx inhibition. Collectively, our results suggest that the Cd-protective effect of H<sub>2</sub> in plants may be explained by its control of the plasma membrane-based NADPH oxidase encoded by <i>RbohD,</i> which operates upstream of IRT1 and regulates root Cd uptake at both the transcriptional and functional levels. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the alleviatory role of H<sub>2</sub> in Cd accumulation and toxicity in plants.
