At the last step of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway chlorophyll synthase (CHLG) esterifies chlorophyllide a and b with phytyl or geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate in chloroplasts. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing CHLG RNA in sense and antisense orientation were examined for the effects of excessive and reduced ectopic CHLG expression, respectively, on the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway and the expression of chlorophyll-binding proteins. Reduced chlorophyll synthase activity does not result in accumulation of chlorophyllide and caused reduced ALA formation and Mg and ferrochelatase activity, while CHLG overexpression correlated with enhanced ALA synthesizing capacity and more chelatase activities. The transcript levels of genes expressing proteins of chlorophyll biosynthesis and chlorophyll-binding proteins were down-regulated in response to reduced CHLG expression. Thus, reduced expression and activity of chlorophyll synthase caused a feedback-controlled inactivation of the initial and rate limiting step of the pathway leading to down regulation of the metabolic flow, while overexpression can mediate a stimulation of the pathway. Chlorophyll synthase is proposed to be important for the co-regulation of the entire pathway and the coordination of synthesis of chlorophyll and the chlorophyll-binding proteins.
