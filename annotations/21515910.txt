['21515910', 'Chloroplast development requires the coordinated action of various proteins, many  of which remain to be identified. Here, we report two novel genes, Mesophyll-cell  RNAi Library line 7 (MRL7) and MRL7-Like (MRL7-L), that are involved in this  process. An Arabidopsis knock-down transgenic plant (MRL7-RNAi) with  delayed-greening phenotype was isolated from an RNA interference (RNAi)  transformant library. Cotyledons and young leaves of MRL7-RNAi were pale in  seedlings and gradually greened as the plant matured, while a knock-out in the  MRL7 gene was seedling lethal. The MRL7 protein was shown to co-localize with a  marker protein for nucleoids in chloroplasts, indicative of a role for the  protein in chloroplast nucleic acid metabolism. Accordingly, chloroplast  development was arrested upon loss of MRL7 function and the expression of  plastid-encoded genes transcribed by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) was  significantly reduced in MRL7 knock-down and knock-out plants. A paralog of MRL7  (MRL7-L) was identified in the Arabidopsis genome. Both MRL7 and MRL7-L are only  found in land plants and encode previously uncharacterized proteins without any  known conserved domain. Like MRL7, knock-down of MRL7-L also resulted in a  virescent phenotype, and a similar effect on plastid gene expression. However,  the MRL7-L protein was localized to the chloroplast stroma. Taken together, our  data indicate that the two paralogous proteins MRL7 and MRL7-L have essential but  distinct roles during early chloroplast development and are involved in  regulation of plastid gene expression.', '2011 Jun', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcr054', 'Luo']
