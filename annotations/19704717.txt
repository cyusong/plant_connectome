Previous studies have reported that light is required for activating Arabidopsis programmed cell death (PCD) induced by ultraviolet-C (UV-C) overexposure, and a caspase-like protease cleaving the caspase-3 substrate Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVDase activity) is induced during this process. Our recent report has suggested that a quick burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is mainly derived from mitochondria and chloroplasts, is induced in a light dependent manner during the early stages of UV-induced plant PCD. Concomitantly, the mitochondria undergo serious dysfunction including the MTP loss and the changes in distribution and mobility, which ultimately lead to apoptotic-cell death. Though some of signaling molecules have been elucidated in this type of plant cell death, the molecular mechanism about UV-induce Arabidopsis PCD is still poorly understood when comparing with the study of signaling pathways involved in animal cell apoptosis induced by UV. By using the Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts as a reference model, we have begun to shed light on the complexity of signaling pathway in UV-induced plant PCD. Recently we have tried to real-time detect the presence of caspase-like proteolytic activation, and to sort out the key role of ROS as well as to further assess the relationship between the ROS production and caspase-like activation in this type of plant apoptotic cell death.
