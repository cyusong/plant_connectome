Proteases with an aspartate cleavage specificity are known to contribute to programmed cell death (PCD) in animals and plants. In animal cells this proteolytic activity belongs to caspases, a well-characterized family of cysteine-dependent death proteases. Plants, however, lack caspase homologs and thus the origin of this type of proteolytic activity in planta was poorly understood. Here, we review recent data demonstrating that a plant serine-dependent protease, phytaspase, shares cleavage specificity and a role in PCD analogous to that of caspases. However, unlike caspases, regulation of phytaspase-mediated cleavage of intracellular target proteins appears to be attained not at the level of proenzyme processing/activation, which occurs, in the case of phytaspase, autocatalytically and constitutively. Rather, the mature phytaspase is excluded from healthy cells into the apoplast and is allowed to re-enter cells upon the induction of PCD. Thus, PCD-related proteases in animals and plants display both common features and important distinctions.
