<i>Scilla</i> species are used as medicinal plants and contain lanosterol-type triterpene glycosides. The phytochemical investigation of the bulbs of <i>Scilla peruviana</i> led to the isolation of 17 compounds, including three new rearranged pentacyclic-lanosterol glycosides (1-3) and two new homoisoflavanone glycosides (12 and 13). The structures of the undescribed compounds were determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including two-dimensional (2D) NMR. Among the triterpene glycosides, 2, 3, and 6 showed significant pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. The oral administration of scillascilloside D-2 (6) reduced serum triglyceride levels in a dose-dependent manner in soybean oil-loaded mice.
