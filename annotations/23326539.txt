['23326539', 'Mediator is a conserved multi-protein complex that plays an important role in  regulating transcription by mediating interactions between transcriptional  activator proteins and RNA polymerase II. Much evidence exists that Mediator  plays a constitutive role in the transcription of all genes transcribed by RNA  polymerase II. However, evidence is mounting that specific Mediator subunits may  control the developmental regulation of specific subsets of RNA polymerase  II-dependent genes. Although the Mediator complex has been extensively studied in  yeast and mammals, only a few reports on Mediator function in flowering time  control of plants, little is known about Mediator function in floral organ  identity. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, MEDIATOR SUBUNIT 18 (MED18)  affects flowering time and floral organ formation through FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC)  and AGAMOUS (AG). A MED18 loss-of-function mutant showed a remarkable syndrome of  later flowering and altered floral organ number. We show that FLC and AG mRNA  levels and AG expression patterns are altered in the mutant. Our results support  parallels between the regulation of FLC and AG and demonstrate a developmental  role for Mediator in plants.', '2013', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0053924', 'Oppenheimer']
