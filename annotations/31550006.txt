As an important environment factor, light affects plant growth and development throughout life. B-BOX (BBX) proteins play key roles in the regulation of light signaling. Although the multiple roles of BBX proteins have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis, the research in apple is much less extensive. In this study, we systematically characterized the negative role of an apple BBX protein MdBBX37 in light signaling, including inhibiting anthocyanin biosynthesis and promoting hypocotyl elongation. We found that MdBBX37 interacted with MdMYB1 and MdMYB9, two key positive regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis, and inhibited the binding of those two proteins to their target genes and, therefore, negatively regulated anthocyanin biosynthesis. In addition, MdBBX37 directly bound to the promoter of MdHY5, a positive regulator of light signaling, and suppressed its expression, and thus relieved MdHY5-mediated hypocotyl inhibition. Taken together, our investigations suggest that MdBBX37 is a negative regulator of light signaling in apple. Our study will provide reference for further study on the functions of BBX proteins in apple.
