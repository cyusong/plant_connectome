Proteases are an integral part of plant defence systems, and their role in plant-pathogen interactions is unequivocal. Emerging evidence suggests that different protease families contribute to the establishment not only of hypersensitive response, priming, and signalling, but also of recognition events through complex proteolytic cascades. Moreover, they play a crucial role in pathogen/microbe-associated molecular pattern (PAMP/MAMP)-triggered immunity as well as in effector-triggered immunity. However, despite important advances in our understanding of the role of proteases in plant defence, the contribution of proteases to pathogen defence in grapevine remains poorly understood. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the main grapevine pathosystems and explore the role of serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteases from both the host and pathogen point of views.
