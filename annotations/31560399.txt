Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a conserved eukaryotic RNA surveillance mechanism that degrades aberrant mRNAs comprising a premature translation termination codon. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent RNA helicase up-frameshift 1 (UPF1) is a major NMD factor in all studied organisms; however, the complexity of this mechanism has not been fully characterized in plants. To identify plant NMD factors, we analyzed UPF1-interacting proteins using tandem affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry. Canonical members of the NMD pathway were found along with numerous NMD candidate factors, including conserved DEA(D/H)-box RNA helicase homologs of human DDX3, DDX5 and DDX6, translation initiation factors, ribosomal proteins and transport factors. Our functional studies revealed that depletion of DDX3 helicases enhances the accumulation of NMD target reporter mRNAs but does not result in increased protein levels. In contrast, silencing of DDX6 group leads to decreased accumulation of the NMD substrate. The inhibitory effect of DDX6-like helicases on NMD was confirmed by transient overexpression of RH12 helicase. These results indicate that DDX3 and DDX6 helicases in plants have a direct and opposing contribution to NMD and act as functional NMD factors.
