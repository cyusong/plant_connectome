Salinity stress affects global food producing areas by limiting both crop growth and yield. Attempts to develop salinity-tolerant rice varieties have had limited success due to the complexity of the salinity tolerance trait, high variation in the stress response and a lack of available donors for candidate genes for cultivated rice. As a result, finding suitable donors of genes and traits for salinity tolerance has become a major bottleneck in breeding for salinity tolerant crops. Twenty-two wild <i>Oryza</i> relatives have been recognized as important genetic resources for quantitatively inherited traits such as resistance and/or tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. In this review, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of such an approach by critically analyzing evolutionary, ecological, genetic, and physiological aspects of <i>Oryza</i> species. We argue that the strategy of rice breeding for better Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion employed for the last few decades has reached a plateau and cannot deliver any further improvement in salinity tolerance in this species. This calls for a paradigm shift in rice breeding and more efforts toward targeting mechanisms of the tissue tolerance and a better utilization of the potential of wild rice where such traits are already present. We summarize the differences in salinity stress adaptation amongst cultivated and wild <i>Oryza</i> relatives and identify several key traits that should be targeted in future breeding programs. This includes: (1) efficient sequestration of Na<sup>+</sup> in mesophyll cell vacuoles, with a strong emphasis on control of tonoplast leak channels; (2) more efficient control of xylem ion loading; (3) efficient cytosolic K<sup>+</sup> retention in both root and leaf mesophyll cells; and (4) incorporating Na<sup>+</sup> sequestration in trichrome. We conclude that while amongst all wild relatives, <i>O. rufipogon</i> is arguably a best source of germplasm at the moment, genes and traits from the wild relatives, <i>O. coarctata</i>, <i>O. latifolia</i>, and <i>O. alta</i>, should be targeted in future genetic programs to develop salt tolerant cultivated rice.
