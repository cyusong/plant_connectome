Plastoglobules are dynamic protein-lipid microcompartments in plastids enriched for isoprenoid-derived metabolites. Chloroplast plastoglobules support formation, remodeling, and controlled dismantling of thylakoids during developmental transitions and environmental responses. However, the specific molecular functions of most plastoglobule proteins are still poorly understood. This review harnesses recent co-mRNA expression data from combined microarray and RNA-seq information in ATTED-II on an updated inventory of 34 PG proteins, as well as proteomics data across 30 Arabidopsis tissue types from ATHENA. Hierarchical clustering based on relative abundance for the plastoglobule proteins across non-photosynthetic and photosynthetic tissue types showed their coordinated protein accumulation across Arabidopsis parts, tissue types, development, and senescence. Evaluation of mRNA-based forced networks at different coefficient thresholds identified a central hub with seven plastoglobule proteins and four peripheral modules. Enrichment of specific nuclear transcription factors (e.g. Golden2-like) and support for crosstalk between plastoglobules and the plastid gene expression was observed, and specific ABC1 kinases appear part of a light signaling network. Examples of other specific findings are that FBN7b is involved with upstream steps of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and that ABC1K9 is involved in starch metabolism. This review provides new insights into the functions of plastoglobule proteins and an improved framework for experimental studies.
