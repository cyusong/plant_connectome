The shape of comparable tissues and organs is consistent among individuals of a given species, but how this consistency or robustness is achieved remains an open question. The interaction between morphogenetic factors determines organ formation and subsequent shaping, which is ultimately a mechanical process. Using a computational approach, we show that the epidermal layer is essential for the robustness of organ geometry control. Specifically, proper epidermal restriction allows organ asymmetry maintenance, and the tensile epidermal layer is sufficient to suppress local variability in growth, leading to shape robustness. The model explains the enhanced organ shape variations in epidermal mutant plants. In addition, differences in the patterns of epidermal restriction may underlie the initial establishment of organ asymmetry. Our results show that epidermal restriction can answer the longstanding question of how cellular growth noise is averaged to produce precise organ shapes, and the findings also shed light on organ asymmetry establishment.
