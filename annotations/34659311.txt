Rice blast caused by <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is one of the most important diseases that seriously threaten rice production. <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> is a grass species closely related to grain crops, such as rice, barley, and wheat, and has become a new model plant of Gramineae. In this study, 15 small RNA samples were sequenced to examine the dynamic changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression in <i>B. distachyon</i> infected by <i>M. oryzae</i> at 0, 24, and 48 h after inoculation. We identified 432 conserved miRNAs and 288 predicted candidate miRNAs in <i>B. distachyon</i>. Additionally, there were 7 and 19 differentially expressed miRNAs at 24 and 48 h post-inoculation, respectively. Furthermore, using degradome sequencing, we identified 2,126 genes as targets for 308 miRNAs; using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we validated five miRNA/target regulatory units involved in <i>B. distachyon-M. oryzae</i> interactions. Moreover, using co-transformation technology, we demonstrated that <i>BdNAC21</i> was negatively regulated by miR164c. This study provides a new approach for identifying resistance genes in <i>B. distachyon</i> by mining the miRNA regulatory network of host-pathogen interactions.
