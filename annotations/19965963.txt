Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in plant defense against pathogens, but evidence for their role in defense against insects is still preliminary and inconsistent. In this study, we examined the potential role of ROS in defense of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa) against Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) larvae. Rapid and prolonged accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was detected in wheat plants at the attack site during incompatible interactions. Increased accumulation of both H(2)O(2) and superoxide was detected in rice plants during nonhost interactions with the larvae. No increase in accumulation of either H(2)O(2) or superoxide was observed in wheat plants during compatible interactions. A global analysis revealed changes in the abundances of 250 wheat transcripts and 320 rice transcripts encoding proteins potentially involved in ROS homeostasis. A large number of transcripts encoded class III peroxidases that increased in abundance during both incompatible and nonhost interactions, whereas the levels of these transcripts decreased in susceptible wheat during compatible interactions. The higher levels of class III peroxidase transcripts were associated with elevated enzymatic activity of peroxidases at the attack site in plants during incompatible and nonhost interactions. Overall, our data indicate that class III peroxidases may play a role in ROS generation in resistant wheat and nonhost rice plants during response to Hessian fly attacks.
