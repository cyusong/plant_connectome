Aluminum (Al)-tolerant tobacco cell line ALT301 derived from SL (wild-type) hardly exhibits Al-triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with SL. Molecular mechanism leading to this phenotype was investigated comparatively with SL. Under normal growth condition, metabolome data suggested the activation of glycolysis and lactate fermentation but the repression of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in ALT301, namely aerobic fermentation, which seemed to be transcriptionally controlled partly by higher expression of genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. Microarray and gene ontology analyses revealed the upregulation of the gene encoding related to APETALA2.3 (RAP2.3)-like protein, one of the group VII ethylene response factors (ERFVIIs), in ALT301. ERFVII transcription factors are known to be key regulators for hypoxia response that promotes substrate-level ATP production by glycolysis and fermentation. ERFVIIs are degraded under normoxia by the N-end rule pathway of proteolysis depending on both oxygen and nitric oxide (NO), and NO is produced mainly by nitrate reductase (NR) in plants. In ALT301, levels of the NR gene expression (NIA2), NR activity and NO production were all lower compared with SL. Consistently, the known effects of NO on respiratory pathways were also repressed in ALT301. Under Al-treatment condition, NO level increased in both lines but was lower in ALT301. These results suggest that the upregulation of the RAP2.3-like gene and the downregulation of the NIA2 gene and resultant NO depletion in ALT301 coordinately enhance aerobic fermentation, which seems to be related to a higher capacity to prevent ROS production in mitochondria under Al stress.
