Calcium is one of the most pleiotropic second messengers in all living organisms. However, signalling specificity is encoded via spatio-temporally regulated signatures that act with surgical precision to elicit highly specific cellular responses. How this is brought about remains a big challenge in the plant field, in part due to a lack of specific tools to manipulate/interrogate the plant Ca<sup>2+</sup> toolkit. In many cases, researchers resort to tools that were optimized in animal cells. However, the obviously large evolutionary distance between plants and animals implies that there is a good chance observed effects may not be specific to the intended plant target. Here, we provide an overview of pharmacological strategies that are commonly used to activate or inhibit plant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling. We focus on highlighting modes of action where possible, and warn for potential pitfalls. Together, this review aims at guiding plant researchers through the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pharmacology swamp.
