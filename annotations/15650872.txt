['15650872', 'The mevalonate-independent methylerythritol phosphate pathway is widespread in  bacteria. It is also present in the chloroplasts of all phototrophic organisms.  Whereas the first steps, are rather well known, GcpE and LytB, the enzymes  catalyzing the last two steps have been much less investigated.  2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate is transformed by GcpE into  4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate, which is converted by LytB into  isopentenyl diphosphate or dimethylallyl diphosphate. Only the bacterial GcpE and  LytB enzymes have been investigated to some extent, but nothing is known about  the corresponding plant enzymes. In this contribution, the prosthetic group of  GcpE from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the bacterium Escherichia coli has  been fully characterized by Mossbauer spectroscopy after reconstitution with  (57)FeCl(3), Na(2)S and dithiothreitol. It corresponds to a [4Fe-4S] cluster,  suggesting that both plant and bacterial enzymes catalyze the reduction of  2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate into  (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate via two consecutive one-electron  transfers. In contrast to the bacterial enzyme, which utilizes  NADPH/flavodoxin/flavodoxin reductase as a reducing shuttle system, the plant  enzyme could not use this reduction system. Enzymatic activity was only detected  in the presence of the 5-deazaflavin semiquinone radical.', '2005 Mar', 'J Biol Inorg Chem', '10.1007/s00775-004-0619-z', 'Rohmer']
