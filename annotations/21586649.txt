['21586649', 'Cytosolic/nuclear molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein families HSP90  and HSC70 are conserved and essential proteins in eukaryotes. These proteins have  essentially been implicated in the innate immunity and abiotic stress tolerance  in higher plants. Here, we demonstrate that both chaperones are recruited in  Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) for stomatal closure induced by several  environmental signals. Plants overexpressing HSC70-1 or with reduced HSP90.2  activity are compromised in the dark-, CO(2)-, flagellin 22 peptide-, and  abscisic acid (ABA)-induced stomatal closure. HSC70-1 and HSP90 proteins are  needed to establish basal expression levels of several ABA-responsive genes,  suggesting that these chaperones might also be involved in ABA signaling events.  Plants overexpressing HSC70-1 or with reduced HSP90.2 activity are hypersensitive  to ABA in seed germination assays, suggesting that several chaperone complexes  with distinct substrates might tune tissue-specific responses to ABA and the  other biotic and abiotic stimuli studied. This study demonstrates that the  HSC70/HSP90 machinery is important for stomatal closure and serves essential  functions in plants to integrate signals from their biotic and abiotic  environments.', '2011 Jul', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.174425', 'Noel']
