Optical films that alter light transmittance may reduce energy consumption in high-tech greenhouses, but their impact on crop physiology remains unclear. We compared the stomatal responses of Capsicum plants grown hydroponically under control glass (70% diffuse light) or the smart glass (SG) film ULR-80, which blocked >50% of short-wave radiation and ~9% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). SG had no significant effects on steady-state (gs) or maximal (gmax) stomatal conductance. In contrast, SG reduced stomatal pore size and sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), thereby increasing rates of leaf water loss, guard cell K+ and Cl- efflux, and Ca2+ influx. SG induced faster stomatal closing and opening rates on transition between low (100 µmol m-2 s-1) and high PAR (1500 µmol m-2 s-1), which compromised water use efficiency relative to control plants. The fraction of blue light (0% or 10%) did not affect gs in either treatment. Increased expression of stomatal closure and photoreceptor genes in epidermal peels of SG plants is consistent with fast stomatal responses to light changes. In conclusion, stomatal responses of Capsicum to SG were more affected by changes in light intensity than spectral quality, and re-engineering of the SG should maximize PAR transmission, and hence CO2 assimilation.
