DNA microarrays have been used to characterize plant transcriptomes to answer various biological questions. While many studies have provided significant insights, there has been great debate about the general reliability of the technology and data analysis. When compared to well-established transcript analysis technologies, such as RNA blot analysis or quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, discrepancies have frequently been observed. The reasons for these discrepancies often relate to the technical and experimental systems. This review-tutorial addresses common problems in microarray analysis and describes: (i) methods to maximize extraction of valuable biological information from the vast amount of microarray data and (ii) approaches to balance resource availability with high scientific standards and technological innovation with peer acceptability.
