Prior to and/or accompanying lipolytic degradation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) during seed germination in oilseeds, certain enzymatic and non-enzymatic signaling molecules are expressed on the oil body membranes. These include certain proteases, lipoxygenase, phospholipase A(2) and lipase. Although enough biochemical investigations have demonstrated their activities, recent developments in the in situ localization of these signaling molecules in germinating oilseeds, have enhanced our understanding in this field. This is evident from the temporal and spatial changes observed in the expression pattern of some of these molecules. Present review aims at providing an up-to-date account of these recent developments in the author's and other laboratories, which are largely based on fluorescence microscopic and confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) imaging of the molecular changes using specific fluorescent probes. A model for the molecular events associated with oil body mobilization is also being presented.
