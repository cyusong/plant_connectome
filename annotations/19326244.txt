Auxin is essential for the formation of the vascular system. We previously reported that a polar auxin transport inhibitor, 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) decreased intracellular auxin levels and prevented tracheary element (TE) differentiation from isolated Zinnia mesophyll cells, but that additional auxin, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) overcame this inhibition. To understand the role of auxin in gene regulation during TE differentiation, we performed microarray analysis of genes expressed in NPA-treated cells and NPA-NAA-treated cells. The systematic gene expression analysis revealed that NAA promoted the expression of genes related to auxin signaling and transcription factors that are known to be key regulators of differentiation of procambial and xylem precursor cells. NAA also promoted the expression of genes related to biosynthesis and metabolism of other plant hormones, such as cytokinin, gibberellin and brassinosteroid. Interestingly, detailed analysis showed that NAA rapidly induces the expression of auxin carrier gene homologues. It suggested a positive feedback loop for auxin-regulating vascular differentiation. Based on these results, we discuss the auxin function in early processes of transdifferentiation into TEs.
