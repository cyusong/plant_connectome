Guava (<i>Psidium guajava</i> L.), a major fruit crop of the sub-tropical region, is facing a production decline due to drought stress. Morphophysiological responses to drought stress and underlying transcriptional regulations in guava are, largely, unknown. This study evaluated the drought stress tolerance of two guava cultivars, <i>viz</i>. "Gola" and "Surahi," at morphological and physiological levels regulated differentially by ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags). The treatments comprises three moisture regimes, <i>viz</i>. T<sub>o</sub> = 100% (control), T<sub>1</sub> = 75%, and T<sub>2</sub> = 50% of field capacity. There was an overall decrease in both morphological and physiological attributes of studied guava cultivars in response to drought stress. Nonetheless, the water use efficiency of the "Surahi" cultivar increased (41.86%) speculating its higher drought tolerance based on enhanced peroxidase (402%) and catalase (170.21%) activities under 50% field capacity (T<sub>2</sub>). Moreover, higher proline and flavonoid contents reinforced drought stress retaliation of the "Surahi" cultivar. The differential expression of a significant number of ESTs in "Surahi" (234) as compared to "Gola" (117) cultivar, somehow, regulated its cellular, biological, and molecular functions to strengthen morphophysiological attributes against drought stress as indicated by the upregulation of ESTs related to peroxidase, sucrose synthase (SUS), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and ubiquitin at morphological, biochemical, and physiological levels. In conclusion, the drought stress acclimation of pear-shaped guava cultivar "Surahi" is due to the increased activities of peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) complimented by the upregulation of related ESTs.
