['20349287', 'The small acidic protein p23 is best described as a co-chaperone of Hsp90, an  essential molecular chaperone in eukaryotes. p23 binds to the ATP-bound form of  Hsp90 and stabilizes the Hsp90-client protein complex by slowing down ATP  turnover. The stabilizing activity of p23 was first characterized in studies of  steroid receptor-Hsp90 complexes. Earlier studies of the Hsp90 chaperone complex  in plants suggested that a p23-like stabilizing activity was absent in plant cell  lysates. Here, we show that p23-like proteins are present in plants and are  capable of binding Hsp90, but unlike human p23 and yeast ortholog Sba1, the plant  p23-like proteins do not stabilize the steroid receptor-Hsp90 complexes formed in  wheat germ lysate. Furthermore, these proteins do not inhibit the ATPase activity  of plant Hsp90. While transcripts of Arabidopsis thaliana p23-1 and Atp23-2 were  detected under normal growing conditions, those of the closely related Brassica  napus p23-1 were present only after moderate heat stress. These observations  suggest that p23-like proteins in plants are conserved in their binding to Hsp90  but have evolved mechanisms of action different from their yeast and animal  counterparts.', '2010 Sep', 'Cell Stress Chaperones', '10.1007/s12192-010-0182-1', 'Krishna']
