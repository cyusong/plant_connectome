['19147648', 'The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) body is an ER-related organelle that accumulates  high levels of PYK10, a beta-glucosidase with an ER retention signal.  Constitutive ER bodies are present in the epidermal cells of cotyledons,  hypocotyls and roots of young Arabidopsis seedlings, but absent in rosette  leaves. When leaves are wounded, ER bodies are induced around the wounding site  of the leaves (inducible ER bodies). To clarify the functional differences  between these two ER bodies, we compared constitutive ER bodies with inducible ER  bodies in wounded cotyledons of Arabidopsis seedlings. We found that the number  of ER bodies increased both in cotyledons wounded directly (locally wounded  cotyledons) and in unwounded cotyledons exposed to the systemic wound response  (systemically wounded cotyledons). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and  immunoblot analyses revealed that BGLU18, encoding another beta-glucosidase with  an ER retention signal, was induced at the site of wounding, whereas PYK10 was  not. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that BGLU18 protein was exclusively  localized in ER bodies formed directly at the wounding site on cotyledons. ER  bodies were not induced in locally and systemically wounded cotyledons of the  bglu18 knock-out mutant. These results indicate that constitutive and inducible  ER bodies accumulate different sets of beta -glucosidases and may have distinct  functions in defense responses.', '2009 Mar', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcp007', 'Nishimura']
