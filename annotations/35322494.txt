Sustainable production of chemicals and improving these biosources by engineering metabolic pathways to create efficient plant-based biofactories relies on the knowledge of available chemical/biosynthetic diversity present in the plant. Nicotiana species are well known for their amenability towards transformation and other new plant breeding techniques. The genus Nicotiana is primarily known through Nicotiana tabacum L., the source of tobacco leaves and all respective tobacco products. Due to the prevalence of the latter, N. tabacum and related Nicotiana species are one of the most extensively studied plants. The majority of studies focused solely on N. tabacum or other individual species for chemotyping. The present study analysed a diversity panel including 17 Nicotiana species and six accessions of Nicotiana benthamiana and created a data set that effectively represents the chemotype core collection of the genus Nicotiana. The utilisation of several analytical platforms and previously published libraries/databases enabled the identification and measurement of over 360 metabolites of a wide range of chemical classes as well as thousands of unknowns with dedicated spectral and chromatographic properties.
