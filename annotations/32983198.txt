Plants in the field experience dynamic changes of sunlight rather than steady-state irradiation. Therefore, increasing the photosynthetic rate of an individual leaf under fluctuating light is essential for improving crop productivity. The high-yielding <i>indica</i> rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) cultivar Takanari is considered a potential donor of photosynthesis genes because of its higher steady-state photosynthesis at both atmospheric and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations than those of several Japanese commercial cultivars, including Koshihikari. Photosynthetic induction after a sudden increase in light intensity is faster in Takanari than in Koshihikari, but whether the daily carbon gain of Takanari outperforms that of Koshihikari under fluctuating light in the field is unclear. Here we report that Takanari has higher non-steady-state photosynthesis, especially under low nitrogen (N) supply, than Koshihikari. In a pot experiment, Takanari had greater leaf carbon gain during the initial 10 min after a sudden increase in irradiation and higher daily CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation under simulated natural fluctuating light, at both atmospheric (400 ppm) and elevated (800 ppm) CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The electron transport rate during a day under field conditions with low N supply was also higher in Takanari than in Koshihikari. Although the advantages of Takanari were diminished under high N supply, photosynthetic N use efficiency was consistently higher in Takanari than in Koshihikari, under both low and high N supply. This study demonstrates that Takanari is a promising donor parent to use in breeding programs aimed at increasing CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in a wide range of environments, including future higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.
