Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins were identified as site-specific recognition factors for RNA editing in plant mitochondria and plastids. In this study, we characterized maize (Zea mays) kernel mutant defective kernel 53 (dek53), which has an embryo lethal and collapsed endosperm phenotype. Dek53 encodes an E-subgroup PPR protein, which possesses a short PLS repeat region of only seven repeats. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that DEK53 is localized in the mitochondrion. Strand- and transcript-specific RNA-seq analysis showed that the dek53 mutation affected C-to-U RNA editing at more than 60 mitochondrial C targets. Biochemical analysis of mitochondrial protein complexes revealed a significant reduction in the assembly of mitochondrial complex III in dek53. Transmission electron microscopic examination showed severe morphological defects of mitochondria in dek53 endosperm cells. In addition, yeast two-hybrid and luciferase complementation imaging assays indicated that DEK53 can interact with the mitochondrion-targeted non-PPR RNA editing factor ZmMORF1, suggesting that DEK53 might be a functional component of the organellar RNA editosome.
