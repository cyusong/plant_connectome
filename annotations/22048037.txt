Information concerning natural variation either in chiasma frequency or in the genetic basis of any such variation is a valuable tool to characterize phenotypic traits and their genetic control. Here meiotic recombination frequencies are analysed in nine geographically and ecologically diverse accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, and a comparative study was carried out incorporating previous data from another eight accessions. Chiasma frequencies, estimated by counting rod and ring bivalents at metaphase I, varied up to 22% among accessions. However, no differences were found among plants of the same accession. There was a relationship, which does not necessarily imply direct proportionality, between the size of the chromosomes and their mean chiasma frequency. Chiasma frequency and distribution between arms and among chromosomes were not consistent over accessions. These findings indicate the existence of genetic factors controlling meiotic recombination both throughout the whole genome and at the whole chromosome level. The reliability of chiasma scoring as an indicator of reciprocal recombination events is also discussed.
