Grain size is an important agronomic trait determining barley yield and quality. An increasing number of QTLs (quantitative trait loci) for grain size have been reported due to the improvement in genome sequencing and mapping. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underpinning barley grain size is vital for producing elite cultivars and accelerating breeding processes. In this review, we summarize the achievements in the molecular mapping of barley grain size over the past two decades, highlighting the results of QTL linkage analysis and genome-wide association studies. We discuss the QTL hotspots and predict candidate genes in detail. Moreover, reported homologs that determine the seed size clustered into several signaling pathways in model plants are also listed, providing the theoretical basis for mining genetic resources and regulatory networks of barley grain size.
