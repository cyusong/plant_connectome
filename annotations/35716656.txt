Abiotic stressors are one of the major factors affecting agricultural output. Plants have evolved adaptive systems to respond appropriately to various environmental cues. These responses can be accomplished by modulating or fine-tuning genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Understanding the response of plants' molecular features to abiotic stress is a priority in the current period of continued environmental changes. Epigenetic modifications are necessary that control gene expression by changing chromatin status and recruiting various transcription regulators. The present study summarized the current knowledge on epigenetic modifications concerning plant responses to various environmental stressors. The functional relevance of epigenetic marks in regulating stress tolerance has been revealed, and epigenetic changes impact the effector genes. This study looks at the epigenetic mechanisms that govern plant abiotic stress responses, especially DNA methylation, histone methylation/acetylation, chromatin remodeling, and various metabolites. Plant breeders will benefit from a thorough understanding of these processes to create alternative crop improvement approaches. Genome editing with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR/Cas) provides genetic tools to make agricultural genetic engineering more sustainable and publicly acceptable.
