['26161528', 'Meiotic crossovers (COs) generate genetic diversity and are critical for the  correct completion of meiosis in most species. Their occurrence is tightly  constrained but the mechanisms underlying this limitation remain poorly  understood. Here we identified the conserved AAA-ATPase FIDGETIN-LIKE-1 (FIGL1)  as a negative regulator of meiotic CO formation. We show that Arabidopsis FIGL1  limits CO formation genome-wide, that FIGL1 controls dynamics of the two  conserved recombinases DMC1 and RAD51 and that FIGL1 hinders the interaction  between homologous chromosomes, suggesting that FIGL1 counteracts  DMC1/RAD51-mediated inter-homologue strand invasion to limit CO formation.  Further, depleting both FIGL1 and the previously identified anti-CO helicase  FANCM synergistically increases crossover frequency. Additionally, we showed that  the effect of mutating FANCM on recombination is much lower in F1 hybrids  contrasting from the phenotype of inbred lines, while figl1 mutation equally  increases crossovers in both contexts. This shows that the modes of action of  FIGL1 and FANCM are differently affected by genomic contexts. We propose that  FIGL1 and FANCM represent two successive barriers to CO formation, one limiting  strand invasion, the other disassembling D-loops to promote SDSA, which when both  lifted, leads to a large increase of crossovers, without impairing meiotic  progression.', '2015 Jul', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1005369', 'Mercier']
