It is known that the clade A protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2Cs), including ABI1 and ABI2 and other PP2C members, are key players that function directly downstream of the PYR/PYL/RCAR abscisic acid (ABA) receptors. Here, identification of a crucial site for function of ABI2 protein phosphatase in ABA signalling is reported. It was observed that a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) phosphorylation site-like motif (CPL) in the ABI2 molecule is required for the interactions of ABI2 with the two members of the ABA receptors PYL5 and PYL9 and with a downstream protein kinase SnRK2.6, and for the catalytic activity of ABI2 in vitro, as well as for the response of ABI2 to the ABA receptors PYL5/PYL9 in relation to the ABA receptor-induced inhibition of the ABI2 phosphatase activity. Further, genetic evidence was provided to demonstrate that this CPL is required for the function of ABI2 to mediate ABA signalling. These data reveal that this CPL is an important site necessary for both the phosphatase activity of ABI2 and the functional interaction between ABI2 and PYL5/9 ABA receptors, providing new information to understand primary events of ABA signal transduction.
