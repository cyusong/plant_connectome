Although present in different organisms and conserved in their protein sequence, the biological functions of T2 ribonucleases (RNase) are generally unknown. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) LX is a T2/S-like RNase and its expression is known to be associated with phosphate starvation, ethylene responses, and senescence and programmed cell death. In this study, LX function was investigated using antisense tomato plants in which the LX protein level was reduced. LX protein levels normally become elevated when leaves senesce and antisense inhibition of LX retarded the progression of senescence. Moreover, we observed a marked delay of leaf abscission in LX-deficient plants. This correlated with specific induction of LX protein in the tomato mature abscission zone tissue. LX RNase gene regulation and the consequences of antisense inhibition indicate that LX has an important functional role in both abscission and senescence.
