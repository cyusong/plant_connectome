Proper branching and successful reproductive growth is of great importance for rice productivity. Substantial progress has been made in uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying tillering control and spikelet sterility. However, rice tillering is developmentally controlled, and how it is regulated coordinately with reproductive growth remains unclear. This study characterized a rice mutant, the most obvious phenotypes of which are high tillering, reduced height, and infertile spikelets (named this1). Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of this1 plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation. In the this1 mutant, however, the accelerated rate of branching was delayed until the stem elongation stage, while other mutants lost the ability to control branching at all developmental stages. The seed-setting rate of this1 was less than half that of the wild type, owing to defects in pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, and flower opening. Histological analyses showed that the mutation in this1 resulted in anisotropic cell expansion and cell division. Using a map-based cloning approach, This1 was found to encode a class III lipase. Homology searches revealed that THIS1 is conserved in both monocots and eudicots, suggesting that it plays fundamental role in regulating branch and spikelet fertility, as well as other aspects of developmental control. The relative change in expression of marker genes highlighted the possibility that This1 is involved in phytohormone signalling pathways, such as those for strigolactone and auxin. Thus, This1 provides joint control between shoot branching and reproductive development.
