['10559441', 'An Arabidopsis genomic sequence was recently shown to share similarity with  bacterial and eukaryotic phosphate (Pi) transporters. We have cloned the  corresponding cDNA, which we named Pht2;1, and subsequently performed gene  expression studies and functional analysis of the protein product. The cDNA  encodes a 61-kD protein with a putative topology of 12 transmembrane (TM) domains  interrupted by a large hydrophilic loop between TM8 and TM9. Two boxes of eight  and nine amino acids, located in the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively, are  highly conserved among species across all kingdoms (eubacteria, archea, fungi,  plants, and animals). The Pht2;1 gene is predominantly expressed in green tissue,  the amount of transcript staying constant in leaves irrespective of the Pi status  of the shoot; in roots, however, there is a marginal increase in mRNA amounts in  response to Pi deprivation. Although the protein is highly similar to eukaryotic  sodium-dependent Pi transporters, functional analysis of the Pht2;1 protein in  mutant yeast cells indicates that it is a proton/Pi symporter dependent on the  electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Its fairly high apparent  K(m) for Pi (0.4 mM) and high mRNA content in the shoot, especially in leaves,  suggest a role for shoot organs in Pi loading. Pht2;1 thus differs from members  of the recently described plant Pi transporter family in primary structure,  affinity for Pi, and presumed function.', '1999 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.11.11.2153', 'Bucher']
