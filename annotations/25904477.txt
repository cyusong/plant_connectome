The complete chloroplast genome of two colchicine medicinal plants is reported for the first time. Deletion of ycf 15 gene occurred only in Colchicum but not in Gloriosa and suggests this as a potential marker for delineating the two species. Colchicum autumnale L. and Gloriosa superba L. are well-known sources of colchicine, a type of alkaloid and an ancient anti-inflammatory drug used to prevent gout. Accordingly, this alkaloid has been used as a chemical marker for identifying the expanded Colchicaceae family. In the present study, we report the complete chloroplast genome (cpDNA) sequence of two colchicine medicinal plants (G. superba and C. autumnale) that belong to the tribe Colchiceae of the Colchicaceae family. In C. autumnale, the circular double-stranded cpDNA sequence of 156,462 bp consists of two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 27,741 bp each, a large single-copy region (LSC) of 84,246 bp, and a small single-copy region (SSC) of 16,734 bp. The cpDNA sequence of G. superba is longer than that of C. autumnale (157,924 bp), which consists of two IRs (28,063 bp), an SSC (16,786 bp), and an LSC (85,012 bp). Significant structural differences between them were observed in the ycf15 gene. ycf15 gene was absent from C. autumnale cpDNA and affected the length of the chloroplast genome between the species. Furthermore, this gene loss event was specific to the expanded genus of Colchicum sensu Vinnersten and Manning. Therefore, this gene may be an effective and powerful molecular marker for identifying the Colchicum genus within the family.
