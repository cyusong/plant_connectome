Regulating nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of RNA and protein is a key cellular control point. Perturbing the function of plant nuclear transport components can cause significant developmental defects and in this report we add an important line to this evidence. Overexpression of AtRAN1 or AtNUP62 in Nicotiana benthamiana causes significant damage to leaf tissue. This demonstrates that the precise control of nuclear transport is an important aspect of maintaining tissue integrity.

AtRAN1: !overexpression causes! damage to leaf tissue
AtNUP62: !overexpression causes! damage to leaf tissue
nuclear transport components: !perturbing function of! causes developmental defects
nuclear transport: !precise control of! important for maintaining tissue integrity
