Natural plant populations are polymorphic and show intraspecific variation in resistance properties against pathogens. The activation of the underlying defence responses can depend on variation in perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns or elicitors. To dissect such variation, we evaluated the responses induced by laminarin, (a glucan, representing an elicitor from oomycetes) in the wild tomato species Solanum chilense and correlated this to observed infection frequencies of Phytophthora infestans. We measured reactive oxygen species burst and levels of diverse phytohormones upon elicitation in 83 plants originating from nine populations. We found high diversity in basal and elicitor-induced levels of each component. Further we generated linear models to explain the observed infection frequency of P. infestans. The effect of individual components differed dependent on the geographical origin of the plants. We found that the resistance in the southern coastal region, but not in the other regions is directly correlated to ethylene responses and confirmed this positive correlation using ethylene inhibition assays. Our findings reveal high diversity in the strength of defence responses within a species and the involvement of different components with a quantitatively different contribution of individual components to resistance in geographically separated populations of a wild plant species.
