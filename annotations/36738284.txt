Above and belowground linkages are responsible for some of the most important ecosystem processes in unmanaged terrestrial systems including net primary production, decomposition, and carbon sequestration. Global change biology is currently altering above and belowground interactions, reducing ecosystem services provided by natural systems. Less is known regarding how above and belowground linkages impact climate resilience, especially in intentionally managed cropping systems. Waterlogged or flooded conditions will continue to rise across the Midwest, United States due to climate change. The objective of this paper is to explore what is currently known regarding above and belowground linkages and how they impact biological, biochemical, and physiological processes in systems experiencing waterlogged conditions. We also identify key above and belowground processes that are critical for climate resilience in midwestern cropping systems by exploring various interactions that occur within unmanaged landscapes. Above and belowground interactions that support plant growth and development, foster multi-trophic level interactions, and stimulate balanced nutrient cycling are critical for crops experiencing waterlogged conditions. Moreover, incorporating ecological principles such as increasing plant diversity by incorporating crop rotations and adaptive management via delayed planting dates and adjustments in nutrient management will be critical for fostering climate resilience in row-crop agriculture moving forward.
