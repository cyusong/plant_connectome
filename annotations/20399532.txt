['20399532', 'In oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, the activities of two Calvin cycle enzymes  (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH and phosphoribulokinase, PRK)  are regulated by CP12-mediated complex formation. The Arabidopsis genome contains  three genes encoding different CP12 isoforms (CP12-1, At2g47400; CP12-2,  At3g62410 and CP12-3, At1g76560), all plastid-targeted, as demonstrated by  localization in the chloroplast stroma of CP12 precursor sequences fused with the  green fluorescence protein (GFP). The disorder predictor PONDR classified  Arabidopsis CP12s as largely disordered proteins, and circular dichroism spectra  confirmed these predictions. Based on sequence similarity, 66 CP12s from  different organisms were identified and clustered in six types, with CP12-1 and  -2 grouping together with other largely disordered sequences (Type I), while a  lower level of disorder was predicted within the cluster including CP12-3 (Type  II). The three Arabidopsis CP12 isoforms were expressed as mature recombinant  forms and purified to homogeneity. Redox titrations demonstrated that the four  conserved cysteines of each CP12 isoform could form two internal disulfide  bridges with different midpoint redox potentials (E(m,7.9) -326 mV and -350 mV in  both CP12-1 and CP12-2; E(m,7.9) -332 mV and -373 mV in CP12-3). In agreement  with their similar redox properties, all CP12 isoforms formed, in vitro, a  supramolecular complex with GAPDH and PRK, with comparable inhibitory effects on  both enzyme activities. In order to test whether CP12 isoforms might have broader  regulatory functions than regulating Calvin cycle enzymes, CP12 proteins were  analyzed for their capacity to bind plastidial glycolytic GAPDH (GapCp). To this  purpose, the mature form of Arabidopsis GapCp2 was cloned, expressed in  recombinant form and purified to homogeneity. However, contrary to expectations,  no CP12 isoform was able to bind GapCp2 under any of the conditions tested.', '2010 Aug 15', 'J Plant Physiol', '10.1016/j.jplph.2010.02.008', 'Sparla']
