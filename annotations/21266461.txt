Determining the mobile signal used by plants to defend against biotic and abiotic stresses has proved elusive, but jasmonic acid (JA) and its derivatives appear to be involved. Using deuterium-labeled analogs, we investigated the distal transport of JA and jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) in response to leaf wounding in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants. We recovered [(2)H(2)-2]JA ([(2)H(2)]JA) and [(2)H(3)-12]JA-Ile ([(2)H(3)]JA-Ile) in distal leaves of N. tabacum and S. lycopersicum after treating wounded leaves with [(2)H(2)]JA or [(2)H(3)]JA-Ile. We found that JA-Ile had a greater mobility than JA, despite its lower polarity, and that application of exogenous JA-Ile to wounded leaves of N. tabacum led to a higher accumulation of JA and JA-Ile in distal leaves compared with wounded control plants. We also found that exudates from the stem of S. lycopersicum plants with damaged leaflets contained JA and JA-Ile at higher levels than in an undamaged plant, and a significant difference in the levels of JA-Ile was observed 30 min after wounding. Based on these results, it was found that JA-Ile is a transportable compound, which suggests that JA-Ile is a signaling cue involved in the resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants.
