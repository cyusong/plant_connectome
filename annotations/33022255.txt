The role of microbes in sustaining agricultural plant growth has great potential consequences for human prosperity. Yet we have an incomplete understanding of the basic function of rhizosphere microbial communities and how they may change under future stresses, let alone how these processes might be harnessed to sustain or improve crop yields. A reductionist approach may aid the generation and testing of hypotheses that can ultimately be translated to agricultural practices. With this in mind, we ask whether some rhizosphere microbial communities might be governed by 'keystone metabolites', envisioned here as microbially produced molecules that, through antibiotic and/or growth-promoting properties, may play an outsized role in shaping the development of the community spatiotemporally. To illustrate this point, we use the example of redox-active metabolites, and in particular phenazines, which are produced by many bacteria found in agricultural soils and have well-understood catalytic properties. Phenazines can act as potent antibiotics against a variety of cell types, yet they also can promote the acquisition of essential inorganic nutrients. In this essay, we suggest the ways these metabolites might affect microbial communities and ultimately agricultural productivity in two specific scenarios: firstly, in the biocontrol of beneficial and pathogenic fungi in increasingly arid crop soils and, secondly, through promotion of phosphorus bioavailability and sustainable fertilizer use. We conclude with specific proposals for future research.

Phenazines: !act as! antibiotics 
Phenazines: !promote! nutrient acquisition 
Biocontrol: !controls! beneficial/pathogenic fungi 
Phosphorus bioavailability: !enhances! sustainable fertilizer use
