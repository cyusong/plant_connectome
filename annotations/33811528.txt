The proteins related to the biosynthesis of salvianolic acids and lignins were regulated by smoke-water and karrikinolide in Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy roots. The effects of smoke-water (SW) and karrikinolide (KAR<sub>1</sub>) on the biosynthesis of salvianolic acids and lignins in Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy roots have been studied using proteomic technology. The results showed that a total of 1290 and 1678 differentially expressed proteins were respectively obtained in SW and KAR<sub>1</sub> comparing to the control. Bioinformatics analysis indicated the differentially expressed proteins responding to SW and KAR<sub>1</sub> treatments mainly involved in macromolecule metabolic process, cell part, binding, etc., and most of the proteins were located at the cytoplasm and cell membrane, followed by nuclear. In addition, the proteins involved in salvianolic acids biosynthesis were up-regulated, including 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.12) and shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyl-transferase (EC 2.3.1.133). Enzymes involved in lignins biosynthesis were also identified, e.g. cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.195) and peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7). The results indicated that proteins related to the biosynthesis of salvianolic acids and lignins were regulated by SW and KAR<sub>1</sub> in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. This study will enhance our understanding of the mechanism by which SW and KAR<sub>1</sub> on the biosynthesis of salvianolic acids and lignins in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots.
