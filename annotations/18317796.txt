A short root mutant was isolated from an EMS-generated rice mutant library. Under normal growth conditions, the mutant exhibited short root, delayed flowering, and partial sterility. Some sections of the roots revealed that the cell length along the longitudinal axis was reduced and the cell shape in the root elongation zone shrank. Genetic analysis indicated that the short root phenotype was controlled by a recessive gene. Map-based cloning revealed that a nucleotide substitution causing an amino acid change from Gly to Arg occurred in the predicted rice gene (Os02g0550600). It coded an alkaline/neutral invertase and was homologous to Arabidopsis gene AtCyt-inv1. This gene was designated as OsCyt-inv1. The results of carbohydrate analysis showed an accumulation of sucrose and reduction of hexose in the Oscyt-inv1 mutant. Exogenously supplying glucose could rescue the root growth defects of the Oscyt-inv1 mutant. These results indicated that OsCyt-inv1 played important roles in root cell development and reproductivity in rice.
