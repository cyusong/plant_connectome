Improper optimization of the rates and ratios of nitrogen application reduces grain yields and increases the nitrogen loss, thereby affecting environmental quality. In addition, scarcer evidence exists on the integrative approach of nitrogen, which could have effects on the biochemical and physiological characteristics of wheat. Treatments were arranged as nitrogen (N) rates of 00, 75, 150, 225, and 300 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> in the main plots, and different nitrogen ratios were organized in subplots at 5:5:0:0 and 6:4:0:0, which were applied at the sowing, jointing, flowering, and grain filling stages. The results revealed that 225 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> significantly enhanced the stomatal conductance (<i>G</i> <sub>s</sub>), photosynthetic rate (<i>P</i> <sub>n</sub>), intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>C</i> <sub>i</sub>), transpiration rate (<i>T</i> <sub>r</sub>), and total chlorophyll by 28.5%, 42.3%, 10.0%, 15.2%, and 50%, receptively, at the jointing stage in comparison to the control (0 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>). Nitrogen application of 225 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> increased the soil-plant analysis development (SPAD) value and the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoid contents of winter wheat under the 6:4:0:0 ratio. The trend of the photosynthetic characteristics was observed to be greater at the 6:4:0:0 fertilization ratio compared to that at 5:5:0:0. The photosynthetic rate was significantly associated with the biochemical and physiological characteristics of winter wheat. In conclusion, the nitrogen dose of 225 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> and the ratio of 6:4:0:0 (quantity applied at the sowing, jointing, flowering, and grain filling stages) effectively promoted the photosynthetic and other physiological characteristics of winter wheat.
