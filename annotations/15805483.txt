An inward Shaker K(+) channel identified in Zea mays (maize), ZmK2.1, displays strong regulation by external K(+) when expressed in Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) oocytes or COS cells. ZmK2.1 is specifically activated by K(+) with an apparent K(m) close to 15 mM independent of the membrane hyperpolarization level. In the absence of K(+), ZmK2.1 appears to enter a nonconducting state. Thus, whatever the membrane potential, this maize channel cannot mediate K(+) influx in the submillimolar concentration range, unlike its relatives in Arabidopsis thaliana. Its expression is restricted to the shoots, the strongest signal (RT-PCR) being associated with vascular/bundle sheath strands. Based on sequence and gene structure, the closest relatives of ZmK2.1 in Arabidopsis are K(+) Arabidopsis Transporter 1 (KAT1) (expressed in guard cells) and KAT2 (expressed in guard cells and leaf phloem). Patch-clamp analyses of guard cell protoplasts reveal a higher functional diversity of K(+) channels in maize than in Arabidopsis. Channels endowed with regulation by external K(+) similar to that of ZmK2.1 (channel activity regulated by external K(+) with a K(m) close to 15 mM, regulation independent of external Ca(2+)) constitute a major component of the maize guard cell inward K(+) channel population. The presence of such channels in maize might reflect physiological traits of C4 and/or monocotyledonous plants.
