The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system has been widely utilized for targeted genome modification in a wide range of species. It is a powerful genome editing technology, providing significant benefits for gene functional research and molecular breeding. However, to date, no study has applied this genome editing tool to sesame (<i>Sesamum indicum</i> L.), one of the most ancient and important oil crops used widely in diverse industries such as food and medicine. Herein, the CRISPR/Cas9 system along with hairy root transformation was used to induce targeted mutagenesis in sesame. Two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to target two sesame cytochrome P450 genes (<i>CYP81Q1</i> and <i>CYP92B14</i>), which are the key biosynthetic gene of sesamin and sesamolin, respectively. Sequencing data illustrated the expected InDel mutations at the target sites, with 90.63 and 93.33% mutation frequency in <i>CYP81Q1</i> and <i>CYP92B14</i>, respectively. The most common editing event was single nucleotide deletion and insertion. Sequencing of potential off-target sites of <i>CYP92B14</i>-sgRNA showed no off-target events in cases of three mismatches. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that sesamin and sesamolin biosynthesis was effectively disrupted in the mutated hairy roots, confirming the crucial role of <i>CYP81Q1</i> and <i>CYP92B14</i> in sesame lignan biosynthesis. These results demonstrated that targeted mutagenesis was efficiently created by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and CRISPR/Cas9 coupled with hairy root transformation is an effective tool for assessing gene functions in sesame.
