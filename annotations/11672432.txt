['11672432', 'PtdIns phosphate kinases (PIPkins), which generate PtdInsP(2) isomers, have been  classified into three subfamilies that differ in their substrate specificities.  We demonstrate here that the previously identified AtPIP5K1 gene from Arabidopsis  thaliana encodes a PIPkin with dual substrate specificity in vitro, capable of  phosphorylating PtdIns3P and PtdIns4P to PtdIns(3,4)P(2) and PtdIns(4,5)P(2)  respectively. We also show that recombinant AtPIP5K1 is phosphorylated by protein  kinase A and a soluble protein kinase from A. thaliana. Phosphorylation of  AtPIP5K1 by protein kinase A is accompanied by a 40% inhibition of its catalytic  activity. Full activity is recovered by treating phosphorylated AtPIP5K1 with  alkaline phosphatase.', '2001 Nov 1', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/0264-6021:3590583', 'Pical']
