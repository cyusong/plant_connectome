Auxin-dependent cell expansion is crucial for initiation of fiber cells in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), which ultimately determines fiber yield and quality. However, the regulation of this process is far from being well understood. In this study, we demonstrate an antagonistic effect between cytokinin (CK) and auxin on cotton fiber initiation. In vitro and in planta experiments indicate that enhanced CK levels can reduce auxin accumulation in the ovule integument, which may account for the defects in the fiberless mutant xu142fl. In turn, supplementation with auxin can recover fiber growth of CK-treated ovules and mutant ovules. We further found that GhPIN3a is a key auxin transporter for fiber-cell initiation and is polarly localized to the plasma membranes of non-fiber cells, but not to those of fiber cells. This polar localization allows auxin to be transported within the ovule integument while specifically accumulating in fiber cells. We show that CKs antagonize the promotive effect of auxin on fiber cell initiation by undermining asymmetric accumulation of auxin in the ovule epidermis through down-regulation of GhPIN3a and disturbance of the polar localization of the protein.
