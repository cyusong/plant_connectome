Anaphase can be categorized into the two subphases of anaphase A and B, but anaphase B has not been clearly described in higher plant cells. In this study, we time-sequentially followed the dynamics of chromosome segregation and spindle elongation in tobacco BY-2 cells using histone-red fluorescent protein (RFP) and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tubulin, respectively. Construction of kymographs and determination of the positions of chromosomes and spindle edges by image processing revealed that anaphase B contributed to about 40% of the chromosome separation in distance, which is comparable with that in animal cells. These results suggest that higher plant cells potentially possess the process of anaphase B.
