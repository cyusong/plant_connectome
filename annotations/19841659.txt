Glucose functions in plants both as a metabolic resource as well as a hormone that regulates expression of many genes. Arabidopsis hexokinase1 (HXK1) is the best understood plant glucose sensor/transducer, yet we are only now appreciating the cellular complexity of its signaling functions. We have recently shown that one of the earliest detectable responses to plant glucose treatments are extensive alterations of cellular F-actin. Interestingly, AtHXK1 is predominantly located on mitochondria, yet also can interact with actin. A normal functioning actin cytoskeleton is required for HXK1 to act as an effector in glucose signaling assays. We have suggested that HXK1 might alter F-actin dynamics and thereby influence the formation and/or stabilization of cytoskeleton-bound polysomes. In this Addendum, we have extended our initial observations on the subcellular targeting of HXK1 and its interaction with F-actin. We then further consider the cellular context in which HXK1 might regulate gene expression.
