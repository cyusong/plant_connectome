['20009022', 'In rice (Oryza sativa), brassinosteroids (BRs) induce cell elongation at the  adaxial side of the lamina joint to promote leaf bending. We identified a rice  mutant (ili1-D) showing an increased lamina inclination phenotype similar to that  caused by BR treatment. The ili1-D mutant overexpresses an HLH protein homologous  to Arabidopsis thaliana Paclobutrazol Resistance1 (PRE1) and the human Inhibitor  of DNA binding proteins. Overexpression and RNA interference suppression of ILI1  increase and reduce, respectively, rice laminar inclination, confirming a  positive role of ILI1 in leaf bending. ILI1 and PRE1 interact with basic  helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein IBH1 (ILI1 binding bHLH), whose overexpression  causes erect leaf in rice and dwarfism in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of ILI1 or  PRE1 increases cell elongation and suppresses dwarf phenotypes caused by  overexpression of IBH1 in Arabidopsis. Thus, ILI1 and PRE1 may inactivate  inhibitory bHLH transcription factors through heterodimerization. BR increases  the RNA levels of ILI1 and PRE1 but represses IBH1 through the transcription  factor BZR1. The spatial and temporal expression patterns support roles of ILI1  in laminar joint bending and PRE1/At IBH1 in the transition from growth of young  organs to growth arrest. These results demonstrate a conserved mechanism of BR  regulation of plant development through a pair of antagonizing HLH/bHLH  transcription factors that act downstream of BZR1 in Arabidopsis and rice.', '2009 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.070441', 'Wang']
