['20473316', "The ubiquitous endonuclease RNase P is responsible for the 5' maturation of tRNA  precursors. Until the discovery of human mitochondrial RNase P, these enzymes had  typically been found to be ribonucleoproteins, the catalytic activity of which is  associated with the RNA component. Here we show that, in Arabidopsis thaliana  mitochondria and plastids, a single protein called 'proteinaceous RNase P'  (PRORP1) can perform the endonucleolytic maturation of tRNA precursors that  defines RNase P activity. In addition, PRORP1 is able to cleave tRNA-like  structures involved in the maturation of plant mitochondrial mRNAs. Finally, we  show that Arabidopsis PRORP1 can replace the bacterial ribonucleoprotein RNase P  in Escherichia coli cells. PRORP2 and PRORP3, two paralogs of PRORP1, are both  localized in the nucleus.", '2010 Jun', 'Nat Struct Mol Biol', '10.1038/nsmb.1812', 'Giege']
