<i>SAPK/SnRK2</i> family genes play crucial roles in plant growth, development, and abiotic stress responses. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize the <i>LpSAPK</i> genes in perennial ryegrass (<i>Lolium perenne</i> L.). The results showed that there are 10 <i>LpSAPKs</i> in perennial ryegrass that could be classified into three groups with similar genic (exon-intron) structures to their orthologous genes in Arabidopsis and other grass species. Ka/Ks analysis suggested that the <i>LpSAPKs</i> and their orthologs were under purifying selection to maintain their conserved function during evolution. Nine out of ten <i>LpSAPKs</i> were localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus with the exception of LpSAPK5 which was only observed in the cytoplasm. Most <i>LpSAPKs</i> were responsive to various abiotic stress and hormonal (ABA, cytokinin, and ethylene) treatments but were downregulated in leaves and upregulated in roots, suggesting that there were unknown <i>cis</i> elements in promoters of these genes or unidentified post-transcriptional mechanism responsible for the tissue-dependent stress-regulated expression of these <i>LpSAPKs</i>. Furthermore, <i>LpSAPK9</i> was identified as a candidate positive regulator in drought tolerance using a yeast ectopic expression system, and <i>LpSAPK9</i> showed contrasting expression changes in drought-sensitive and -tolerant ryegrass varieties, suggesting that expression levels of <i>LpSAPK9</i> were related to ryegrass drought tolerance. These results will facilitate further functional analysis of <i>LpSAPKs</i> for molecular breeding of ryegrass and other related grass species.
