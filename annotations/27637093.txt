['27637093', 'Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental contaminants with  cytotoxic, teratogenic and carcinogenic properties. Bioremediation studies with  bacteria have led to the identification of dioxygenases (DOXs) in the first step  to degrade these recalcitrant compounds. In this study, we characterized the role  of the Arabidopsis thaliana AT5G05600, a putative DOX of the flavonol synthase  family, in the transformation of PAHs. Phenotypic analysis of loss-of-function  mutant lines showed that these plant lines were less sensitive to the toxic  effects of phenanthrene, suggesting possible roles of this gene in PAH  degradation in vivo. Interestingly, these mutant lines showed less accumulation  of H(2)O(2) after PAH exposure. Transgenic lines over-expressing At5g05600 showed  a hypersensitive response and more oxidative stress after phenanthrene  treatments. Moreover, fluorescence spectra results of biochemical assays with the  recombinant His-tagged protein AT5G05600 detected chemical modifications of  phenanthrene. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that AT5G05600  is involved in the catabolism of PAHs and the accumulation of toxic intermediates  during PAH biotransformation in plants. This research represents the first step  in the design of transgenic plants with the potential to degrade PAHs, leading to  the development of vigorous plant varieties that can reduce the levels of these  pollutants in the environment.', '2017 Jan 5', 'J Hazard Mater', '10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.08.058', 'Colon-Carmona']
