Leaf habit is a major axis of plant diversity that has consequences for carbon balance since the leaf is the primary site of photosynthesis. Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) produced by photosynthesis can be allocated to storage and serve as a resiliency mechanism to future abiotic and biotic stress. However, how leaf habit affects NSC storage in an evolutionary context has not been shown. Using a comparative physiological framework and an analysis of evolutionary model fitting, we examined if variation in NSC storage is explained by leaf habit. We measured sugar and starch concentrations in 51 oak species (Quercus spp.) growing in a common garden and representing multiple evolutions of three different leaf habits (deciduous, brevideciduous and evergreen). The best fitting evolutionary models indicated that deciduous oak species are evolving towards higher NSC concentrations than their brevideciduous and evergreen relatives. Notably, this was observed for starch (the primary storage molecule) in the stem (a long-term C storage organ). Overall, our work provides insight into the evolutionary drivers of NSC storage and suggests that a deciduous strategy may confer an advantage against stress associated with a changing world. Future work should examine additional clades to further corroborate this idea.
