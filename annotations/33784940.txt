Receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is WD-40 type scaffold protein, conserved in all eukaryote organisms. Many reports implicated RACK1 in plant hormone signal transduction pathways including in auxin and diverse stress signaling pathways; however, the precise molecular mechanism of its role is not understood. Previously, a group of small compounds targeting the <i>Arabidopsis</i> RACK1A functional site-Tyr<sup>248</sup> have been developed. Here, the three different small compounds are used to elucidate the role of RACK1A in auxin mediated lateral root development. Through monitoring the auxin response in the architecture of lateral roots and auxin reporter assays, a small molecule- SD29-12 was found to stabilize the auxin induced RACK1A Tyr<sup>248</sup> phosphorylation, thereby stimulating auxin signaling and inducing lateral roots formation. In contrast, two other compounds, SD29 and SD29-14, inhibited auxin induced RACK1A Tyr<sup>248</sup> phosphorylation resulting in the inhibition of auxin sensitivity and alternation in the lateral roots formation. Taken together, auxin induced RACK1A Tyr<sup>248</sup> phosphorylation is found to be the critical regulatory mechanism for auxin-mediated lateral root development. This work leads to the molecular understanding of the role RACK1A plays in the auxin induced lateral root development signaling pathways. The auxin signal stimulating compound has the potential to be used as auxin-based root inducing bio-stimulant.
