Array-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping platforms have low genotype error and missing data rates compared to genotyping-by-sequencing technologies. However, design decisions used to create array-based SNP genotyping assays for both research and breeding applications are critical to their success. We describe a novel approach applicable to any animal or plant species for the design of cost-effective imputation-enabled SNP genotyping arrays with broad utility and demonstrate its application through the development of the Illumina Infinium Wheat Barley 40K SNP array Version 1.0. We show that the approach delivers high quality and high resolution data for wheat and barley, including when samples are jointly hybridised. The new array aims to maximally capture haplotypic diversity in globally diverse wheat and barley germplasm while minimizing ascertainment bias. Comprising mostly biallelic markers that were designed to be species-specific and single-copy, the array permits highly accurate imputation in diverse germplasm to improve the statistical power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection. The SNP content captures tetraploid wheat (A- and B-genome) and <i>Aegilops tauschii</i> Coss. (D-genome) diversity and delineates synthetic and tetraploid wheat from other wheat, as well as tetraploid species and subgroups. The content includes SNP tagging key trait loci in wheat and barley, as well as direct connections to other genotyping platforms and legacy datasets. The utility of the array is enhanced through the web-based tool, <i>Pretzel</i> (https://plantinformatics.io/) which enables the content of the array to be visualized and interrogated interactively in the context of numerous genetic and genomic resources to be connected more seamlessly to research and breeding. The array is available for use by the international wheat and barley community.
