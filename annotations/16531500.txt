To gain insight into the processes involved in photosystem II (PSII) biogenesis and maintenance, we characterized the low psii accumulation1 (lpa1) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which generally accumulates lower than wild-type levels of the PSII complex. In vivo protein labeling experiments showed that synthesis of the D1 and D2 proteins was greatly reduced in the lpa1 mutant, while other plastid-encoded proteins were translated at rates similar to the wild type. In addition, turnover rates of the PSII core proteins CP47, CP43, D1, and D2 were higher in lpa1 than in wild-type plants. The newly synthesized PSII proteins were assembled into functional protein complexes, but the assembly was less efficient in the mutant. LPA1 encodes a chloroplast protein that contains two tetratricopeptide repeat domains and is an intrinsic membrane protein but not an integral subunit of PSII. Yeast two-hybrid studies revealed that LPA1 interacts with D1 but not with D2, cytochrome b6, or Alb3. Thus, LPA1 appears to be an integral membrane chaperone that is required for efficient PSII assembly, probably through direct interaction with the PSII reaction center protein D1.
