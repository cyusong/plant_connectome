Setaria viridis is one of the most important model grasses in studying monocot plant biology. Transient gene expression study is a very important tool in plant biotechnology, functional genomics, and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology via particle bombardment. In this study, a particle bombardment-mediated protocol was developed to introduce DNA into Setaria viridis in vitro leaf explants. In addition, physical and biological parameters, such as helium pressure, distance from stopping screen to the target tissues, DNA concentration, and number of bombardments, were tested and optimized. Optimum concentration of transient GFP expression was achieved using 1.5 ug plasmid DNA with 0.6 mm gold particles and 6 cm bombardment distance, using 1,100 psi. Doubling the bombardment instances provides the maximum number of foci of transient GFP expression. This simple protocol will be helpful for genomics studies in the S. viridis monocot model.
