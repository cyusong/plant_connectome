['33139535', 'Ethylene is an important plant hormone that regulates plant growth, in which the  master transcriptionactivator EIN3 (Ethylene Insensitive 3)-mediated  transcriptional activation plays vital roles. However, the EIN3-mediated  transcriptional repression in ethylene response is unknown. We report here that a  Transcriptional Repressor of EIN3-dependent Ethylene-response 1 (TREE1) interacts  with EIN3 to regulate transcriptional repression that leads to an inhibition of  shoot growth in response to ethylene. Tissue-specific transcriptome analysis  showed that most of the genes are down-regulated by ethylene in shoots, and a DNA  binding motif was identified that is important for this transcriptional  repression. TREE1 binds to the DNA motif to repress gene expression in an  EIN3-dependent manner. Genetic validation demonstrated that repression of  TREE1-targeted genes leads to an inhibition of shoot growth. Overall, this work  establishes a mechanism by which transcriptional repressor TREE1 interacts with  EIN3 to inhibit shoot growth via transcriptional repression in response to  ethylene.', '2020 Nov 17', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.2018735117', 'Qiao']
