Effector biology exhibits diversity at every level. Effector proteins play key roles in the molecular interplay between plants and plant-associated organisms, and effector biology remains one of the most active areas in the research field of molecular plant-microbe interactions. Using effectors as probes, much has been learned about pathogen virulence and host immunity, which has broad implications in developing disease-resistant crops that are essential for global food security. Thus, the MPMI Editorial Board is publishing this Focus Issue to showcase recent progress in this area.
