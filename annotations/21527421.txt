The conjugation of the ubiquitin-like modifier NEURAL PRECURSOR CELL-EXPRESSED DEVELOPMENTALLY DOWN-REGULATED PROTEIN8/RELATED TO UBIQUITIN1 (NEDD8/RUB1; neddylation) is best known as an important posttranslational modification of the cullin subunits of cullin-RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). MLN4924 has recently been described as an inhibitor of NEDD8-ACTIVATING ENZYME1 (NAE1) in human. Here, we show that MLN4924 is also an effective and specific inhibitor of NAE1 enzymes from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and other plant species. We found that MLN4924-treated wild-type seedlings have phenotypes that are highly similar to phenotypes of mutants with a partial defect in neddylation and that such neddylation-defective mutants are hypersensitive to MLN4924 treatment. We further found that MLN4924 efficiently blocks the neddylation of cullins in Arabidopsis and that MLN4924 thereby interferes with the degradation of CRL substrates and their downstream responses. MLN4924 treatments also induce characteristic phenotypes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), Cardamine hirsuta, and Brachypodium distachyon. Interestingly, MLN4924 also blocks the neddylation of a number of other NEDD8-modified proteins. In summary, we show that MLN4924 is a versatile and specific neddylation inhibitor that will be a useful tool to examine the role of NEDD8- and CRL-dependent processes in a wide range of plant species.
