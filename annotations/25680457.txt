['25680457', 'Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone that regulates many physiological  functions, such as plant growth, development and stress responses. The MAPK  cascade plays an important role in ABA signal transduction. Several MAPK and  MAPKK molecules are reported to function in ABA signaling; however, there have  been few studies related to the identification of MAPKKK upstream of MAPKK in ABA  signaling. In this study, we show that an Arabidopsis MAPKKK, MAPKKK18 functions  in ABA signaling. The expression of MAPKKK18 was induced by ABA treatment. Yeast  two-hybrid analysis revealed that MAPKKKK18 interacted with MKK3, which  interacted with C-group MAPK, MPK1/2/7. Immunoprecipitated kinase assay showed  that the 3xFlag-tagged MAPKKK18, expressed in Arabidopsis plants, was activated  when treated with ABA. These results indicate the possibility that the MAPK  cascade is composed of MAPKKK18, MKK3 and MPK1/2/7 in ABA signaling. The  transgenic plants overexpressing MAPKKK18 (35S:MAPKKK18) and its kinase negative  mutant (35S:MAPKKK18 KN) were generated, and their growth was monitored. Compared  with the WT plant, 35S:MAPKKK18 and 35S:MAPKKK18 KN showed smaller and bigger  phenotypes, respectively. Senescence of the rosette leaves was promoted in  35S:MAPKKK18, but suppressed in 35S:MAPKKK18 KN. Furthermore, ABA-induced leaf  senescence was accelerated in 35S:MAPKKK18. These results suggest that MAPKKK18  controls the plant growth by adjusting the timing of senescence via its protein  kinase activity in ABA dependent manners.', '2015 Apr', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-015-0295-0', 'Nanmori']
