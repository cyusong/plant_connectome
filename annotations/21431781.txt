['21431781', 'Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinases (LRR RLKs) represent the  largest group of Arabidopsis RLKs with approximately 235 members. A minority of  these LRR RLKs have been assigned to diverse roles in development, pathogen  resistance and hormone perception. Using a reverse genetics approach, a  collection of homozygous T-DNA insertion lines for 69 root expressed LRR RLK  genes was screened for root developmental defects and altered response after  exposure to environmental, hormonal/chemical and abiotic stress. The obtained  data demonstrate that LRR RLKs play a role in a wide variety of signal  transduction pathways related to hormone and abiotic stress responses. The  described collection of T-DNA insertion mutants provides a valuable tool for  future research into the function of LRR RLK genes.', '2011 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-011-9769-x', 'Heidstra']
