['9091322', 'Rab GTPases play a central role in the control of vesicular membrane traffic.  These proteins cycle between cytosolic and membrane-bound compartments in a  guanine nucleotide-dependent manner, a process that is regulated by several  accessory proteins. Of particular interest are the Rab guanosine nucleotide  diphosphate dissociation inhibitor proteins (Rab-GDI) which bind to prenylated  Rab GTPases, slow the rate of GDP dissociation and escort GDP bound Rab proteins  to their target membranes and retrieve them after completion of their catalytic  cycle. We have cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana a cDNA coding for the Rab  guanosine diphosphate dissociation inhibitor (AtGDI1) by functional  complementation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae sec19-1 mutant. The Arabidopsis  cDNA potentially encodes a 49850 Da protein which is homologous to yeast GDI  (49%) and to other members of the Rab-GDI family (49-63%). Northern blot analysis  indicates that the mRNA is expressed in all tissues examined. The existence of a  plant homologue of the Rab-GDI family indicates that the basic vesicle traffic  control machinery may be highly conserved in plants as it is in yeast and  mammals.', '1997 Feb 24', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00072-0', 'Palme']
