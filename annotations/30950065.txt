Auxin/indole-3-acetic acid proteins (Aux/IAAs) play important roles in auxin signaling pathways, with extensive involvement in plant development and plant response to abiotic and biotic stresses. Manihot esculenta (Cassava) is one of the most important biomass energy crops in tropical regions; however, the information about Aux/IAA proteins remain limited in cassava. In this study, 37 MeAux/IAA gene family members were identified in cassava and a phylogenetic analysis was performed. The transcript levels of MeAux/IAAs were commonly regulated by the pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv manihotis (Xam), and some of them were specifically localized to the nucleus. Moreover, the overexpression of MeAux/IAAs confers an improved disease resistance against Xam in Nicotiana benthamiana, while MeAux/IAAs-silenced plants show disease sensitivity against Xam in cassava, as evidenced by the leaf phenotype and leaf bacterial population. Consistent with the disease resistance, MeAux/IAAs regulated the transcript levels of PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES (MePRs), reactive oxygen species accumulation and callose development in the plants' defense response. Taken together, gene profile and functional analysis identified several MeAux/IAAs as novel members in plant disease resistance, providing important information for further utilization of MeAux/IAAs.
