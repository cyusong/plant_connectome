['8220484', 'Mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana which exhibit accelerated cell death in response  to pathogens were isolated and characterized to gain insight into how symptom  severity and disease resistance are modulated. This paper describes mutants that  fall into one of two complementation groups that were identified. A novel feature  of these mutants is that they are unable to control the rate and extent of cell  death after exposure to a variety of stimuli that induce senescence responses.  Thus, accelerated cell death (acd1) mutants show rapid, spreading necrotic  responses to both virulent and avirulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola or  pv. tomato pathogens and to ethylene. In addition, they develop necrotic lesions  as they age and are sensitive to mechanical stress in a developmentally  controlled manner. The acd1 mutants are also susceptible to opportunistic  pathogens and show decreased growth inhibition of a heterologous pathogen of  bean. The signal for lesion formation is not necessarily due to pathogens or  wounding since plants grown aseptically also develop necrotic lesions. The  lesions formed under a variety of conditions resemble those produced during a  pathogen-induced rapid cell death response (the hypersensitive response, HR).  Analysis of these acd1 mutants may help to explain the molecular basis of the HR  and the relationship between this response and the normal process of senescence.', '1993 Aug', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1993.04020327.x', 'Ausubel']
