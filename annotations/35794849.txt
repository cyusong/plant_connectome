Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that are encoded by endogenous miRNA genes and regulate gene expression through gene silencing, by inducing degradation of their target messenger RNA or by inhibiting its translation. Some miRNAs are mobile molecules inside the plant, and increasing experimental evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs represent molecules that are exchanged between plants, their pathogens, and parasitic plants. It has also been shown that miRNAs are secreted into the external growing medium and that these miRNAs regulate gene expression and the phenotype of nearby receiving plants, thus defining a new concept in plant communication. However, the mechanism of miRNA secretion and uptake by plant cells still needs to be elucidated.
