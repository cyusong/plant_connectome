['18808454', 'Ethylene biosynthesis is directed by a family of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic  acid (ACC) synthases (ACS) that convert S-adenosyl-l-methionine to the immediate  precursor ACC. Members of the type-2 ACS subfamily are strongly regulated by  proteolysis with various signals stabilizing the proteins to increase ethylene  production. In Arabidopsis, this turnover is mediated by the ubiquitin/26 S  proteasome system, using a broad complex/tramtrack/bric-a-brac (BTB) E3 assembled  with the ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCER 1 (ETO1) BTB protein for target recognition. Here,  we show that two Arabidopsis BTB proteins closely related to ETO1, designated  ETO1-like (EOL1) and EOL2, also negatively regulate ethylene synthesis via their  ability to target ACSs for breakdown. Like ETO1, EOL1 interacts with type-2 ACSs  (ACS4, ACS5 and ACS9), but not with type-1 or type-3 ACSs, or with type-2 ACS  mutants that stabilize the corresponding proteins in planta. Whereas single and  double mutants affecting EOL1 and EOL2 do not show an ethylene-related phenotype,  they exaggerate the effects caused by inactivation of ETO1, and further increase  ethylene production and the accumulation of ACS5 in eto1 plants. The triple eto1  eol1 eol2 mutant phenotype can be effectively rescued by the ACS inhibitor  aminoethoxyvinylglycine, and by silver, which antagonizes ethylene perception.  Together with hypocotyl growth assays showing that the sensitivity and response  kinetics to ethylene are normal, it appears that ethylene synthesis, but not  signaling, is compromised in the triple mutant. Collectively, the data indicate  that the Arabidopsis BTB E3s assembled with ETO1, EOL1 and EOL2 work together to  negatively regulate ethylene synthesis by directing the degradation of type-2 ACS  proteins.', '2009 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03693.x', 'Vierstra']
