Anther development is an important process for the successful sexual reproduction in plants. Whereas the regulation of the late stages of anther development is quite well described in A. thaliana, little is known about the regulation of the early stages of this process. Two novel groups of factors involved in these early stages have recently been described, namely ROXYs, members of the Glutaredoxin (GRX) family of small and ubiquitous oxidoreductases involved in various cellular and stress-related responses, and SBP-box Genes. ROXYs belong to the CC-type of GRXs with a CCXC active motif and are specific for higher plants. SBP-box genes encode for SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN transcription factors, many of which are targeted by miR156 and miR157. Strikingly, both the enzymes and the transcription factors represent evolutionary conserved gene families and loss-of-function of these genes exhibits similar anther phenotypes, e.g. arresting sporogenous cell formation and missing pollen sacs. This mini-review gives an overview of how these factors affect early anther development and discusses a possible relationship between these factors and other known early anther genes.
