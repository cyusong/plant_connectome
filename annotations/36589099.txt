Uniconazole, a triazole plant growth regulator, is widely used to regulate plant height and prevent the overgrowth of seedlings. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of uniconazole in inhibiting the hypocotyl elongation of seedlings is still largely unclear, and there has been little research on the integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data to investigate the mechanisms of hypocotyl elonga-tion. Herein we observed that the hypocotyl elongation of flowering Chinese cabbage seedings was significantly inhibited by uniconazole. Interestingly, based on combined transcriptome and metabolome analyses, we found that the "phenylpropanoid biosynthesis" pathway was significantly affected by uniconazole. In this pathway, only one member of the portal enzyme gene family, named <i>BrPAL4</i>, was remarkably downregulated, which was related to lignin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays showed that BrbZIP39 could directly bind to the promoter region of <i>BrPAL4</i> and activate its transcript. The virus-induced gene silencing system further demonstrated that <i>BrbZIP39</i> could positively regulate hypocotyl elongation and the lignin biosynthesis of hypocotyl. Our findings provide a novel insight into the molecular regulatory mechanism of uniconazole inhibiting hypocotyl elongation in flowering Chinese cabbage and confirm, for the first time, that uniconazole decreases lignin content through repressing the BrbZIP39-<i>BrPAL4</i> module-mediated phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, which leads to the hypocotyl dwarfing of flowering Chinese cabbage seedlings.
