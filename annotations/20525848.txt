['20525848', 'To elucidate potential roles of CUL4-DDB1-DWD (for Cullin 4-Damaged DNA  Binding1-DDB1 binding WD40) E3 ligases in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, we  examined ABA sensitivities of T-DNA mutants of a number of Arabidopsis thaliana  DWD genes, which encode substrate receptors for CUL4 E3 ligases. Mutants in two  DWD genes, DWA1 and DWA2 (DWD hypersensitive to ABA1 and 2), had  ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes. Both proteins interacted with DDB1 in yeast  two-hybrid assays and associated with DDB1 and CUL4 in vivo, implying they could  form CUL4-based complexes. Several ABA-responsive genes were hyperinduced in both  mutants, and the ABA-responsive transcription factors ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5)  and MYC2 accumulated to high levels in the mutants after ABA treatment. Moreover,  ABI5 interacted with DWA1 and DWA2 in vivo. Cell-free degradation assays showed  ABI5 was degraded more slowly in dwa1 and dwa2 than in wild-type cell extracts.  Therefore, DWA1 and/or DWA2 may be the substrate receptors for a CUL4 E3 ligase  that targets ABI5 for degradation. Our data indicate that DWA1 and DWA2 can  directly interact with each other, and their double mutants exhibited enhanced  ABA and NaCl hypersensitivities, implying they can act together. This report thus  describes a previously unknown heterodimeric cooperation between two independent  substrate receptors for CUL4-based E3 ligases.', '2010 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.073783', 'Deng']
