['19011093', 'In higher plants, the plane of cell division is faithfully predicted by the  preprophase band (PPB). The PPB, a cortical ring of microtubules and F-actin,  disassembles upon nuclear-envelope breakdown. During cytokinesis, the expanding  cell plate fuses with the plasma membrane at the cortical division site, the site  of the former PPB. The nature of the "molecular memory" that is left behind by  the PPB and is proposed to guide the cell plate to the cortical division site is  unknown. RanGAP is the GTPase activating protein of the small GTPase Ran, which  provides spatial information for nucleocytoplasmic transport and various mitotic  processes in animals. Here, we show that, in dividing root cells, Arabidopsis  RanGAP1 concentrates at the PPB and remains associated with the cortical division  site during mitosis and cytokinesis, requiring its N-terminal targeting domain.  In a fass/ton2 mutant, which affects PPB formation, RanGAP1 recruitment to the  PPB site is lost, while its PPB retention is microtubule-independent. RanGAP1  persistence at the cortical division site, but not its initial accumulation at  the PPB requires the 2 cytokinesis-regulating kinesins POK1 and POK2. Depletion  of RanGAP by inducible RNAi leads to oblique cell walls and cell-wall stubs in  root cell files, consistent with cytokinesis defects. We propose that Arabidopsis  RanGAP, a continuous positive protein marker of the plant division plane, has a  role in spatial signaling during plant cell division.', '2008 Nov 25', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0806157105', 'Meier']
