In many fruit species, including grapevine, grafting is used to improve scion productivity and quality and to adapt the plant to environmental conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying the rootstock control of scion development are still poorly understood. The ability of rootstocks to regulate nitrogen uptake and assimilation may contribute to this control. A split-root system was used to grow heterografted grapevines and to investigate the molecular responses to changes in nitrate availability of two rootstocks known to affect scion growth differently. Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing was performed on root samples collected 3 and 24 h after nitrogen supply. The results demonstrated a common response involving nitrogen-related genes, as well as a more pronounced transcriptomic reprogramming in the genotype conferring the lower scion growth. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis allowed the identification of co-regulated gene modules, suggesting a role for nitrate transporter 2 family genes and some transcription factors as main actors controlling this genotype-dependent response to heterogeneous nitrogen supply. The relationship between nitrate, ethylene, and strigolactone hormonal pathways was found to differ between the two genotypes. These findings indicated that the genotypes responded differently to heterogeneous nitrogen availability, and this may contribute to their contrasting effect on scion growth.
