In seagrass food webs, small invertebrate mesograzers often exert top-down control on algal epiphytes growing on seagrass blades, which in turn releases the seagrass from competition for light and nutrients. Yet, nearshore habitat boundaries are permeable, and allochthonous subsidies can provide alternative food sources to <i>in-situ</i> production in seagrass meadows, which may in turn alter mesograzer-epiphyte interactions. We examined the contribution of allochthonous kelp (<i>Nereocystis luetkeana</i>), autochthonous epiphytic macroalgal (<i>Smithora naiadum</i>), <i>Ulva lactuca</i>, and seagrass production to mesograzer diets in a subtidal <i>Zostera marina</i> (eelgrass) meadow. In both choice feeding experiments and isotopic analysis, mesograzer diets revealed a preference for allochthonous <i>N. luetkeana</i> over <i>Z. marina</i>, <i>S. naiadum</i>, and <i>U. lactuca</i>. Notably, <i>Idotea resecata</i> showed an ~20x greater consumption rate for <i>N. luetkeana</i> in feeding experiments over other macrophytes. In the meadow, we found a positive relationship between epiphytic <i>S. naiadum</i> and gammarid amphipod biomass suggesting weak top-down control on the <i>S. naiadum</i> biomass. Epiphyte biomass may be driven by bottom-up factors such as environmental conditions, or the availability and preference of allochthonous kelp, though further work is needed to disentangle these interactions. Additionally, we found that gammarid and caprellid amphipod biomass were positively influenced by adjacency to kelp at seagrass meadow edges. Our findings suggest that <i>N. luetkeana</i> kelp subsidies are important to the diets of mesograzers in <i>Z. marina</i> meadows. Spatial planning and management of marine areas should consider trophic linkages between kelp and eelgrass habitats as a critical seascape feature if the goal is to conserve nearshore food web structure and function.
