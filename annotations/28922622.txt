Light is an important external signal that affects plant growth and development, such as photomorphogenesis. Transcriptional regulation defines a central regulatory mechanism in photomorphogenesis. The B-box zinc finger family consists of 32 proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. Previous studies show that group IV of the B-box family (BBX18 to BBX25) plays either positive or negative roles in regulating photomorphogenesis. We investigated the expression patterns of BBX18 to BBX25 and the results demonstrate that the transcriptional levels of these genes are differentially regulated by the light signaling pathway.
