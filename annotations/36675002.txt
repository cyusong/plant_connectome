Fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins (FLAs) are a subclass of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) containing both AGP-like glycated domains and fasciclin (FAS) domains, which are involved in plant growth and development and synthesis of the cell wall. However, these proteins have not been identified or analyzed in willow, <i>Salix</i>, the sister genus of <i>Populus</i>. In this study, we performed a whole genome study of the FLA gene family of <i>Salix suchowensis</i> and compared it with the FLA gene family of <i>Populus deltoides</i>. The results showed the presence of 40 and 46 FLA genes in <i>P. deltoides</i> and <i>S. suchowensis</i>, distributed on 17 and 16 chromosomes, respectively. Four pairs of tandem repeat genes were found in willow, while poplar had no tandem repeat genes. Twelve and thirteen pairs of duplicated gene fragments were identified in poplar and willow, respectively. The multispecies phylogenetic tree showed that the FLA gene family could be divided into four groups (I-IV), with Group 1 showing significant expansion in woody plants. A gene expression analysis showed that <i>PdeFLA19/27</i> in Group I of poplar was highly expressed, specifically during the secondary growth period of the stem and the rapid elongation of seed hairs. In the Group I genes of <i>S. suchowensis</i>, <i>SsuFLA25/26/28</i> was also highly expressed during the secondary growth period, whereas increased expression of <i>SsuFLA35</i> was associated with seed hair tissue. These results provide important clues about the differences in the FLA gene family during the evolution of herbs and woody plants, and suggest that the FLA gene family may play an essential role in regulating the secondary growth of woody plants. It also provides a reference for further studies on the regulation of secondary growth and seed hair development by FLA genes in poplar and willow.
