Abiotic stresses have already exhibited the negative effects on crop growth and development, thereby influencing crop quality and yield. Therefore, plants have developed regulatory mechanisms to adopt against such harsh changing environmental conditions. Recent studies have shown that zinc finger protein transcription factors play a crucial role in plant growth and development as well as in stress response. C2H2 zinc finger proteins are one of the best-studied types and have been shown to play diverse roles in the plant abiotic stress responses. However, the C2H2 zinc finger network in plants is complex and needs to be further studied in abiotic stress responses. Here in this review, we mainly focus on recent findings on the regulatory mechanisms, summarize the structural and functional characterization of C2H2 zinc finger proteins, and discuss the C2H2 zinc finger proteins involved in the different signal pathways in plant responses to abiotic stress.
