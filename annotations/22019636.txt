Most terrestrial plant roots form mutualistic symbiosis with soil-borne arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a characteristic feature of which is nutrient exchange between the two symbiotic partners. Phosphate (Pi) is the main benefit the host plants acquired from the AMF. It has long been a common realization that high Pi supply could suppress the AMF development. However, the direct molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying this plant directed suppression are lacking. Here, we reviewed the recent work providing the evidences that high Pi supply induces transcriptional alteration, leading to the inhibition of AMF development at different stages of AM symbiosis, and gave our view on potential cross-talk among Pi starvation, AM as well as phytohormone signaling.

Pi: !suppresses! AMF development
Transcriptional alteration: !induces! inhibition of AMF development
Pi starvation: !cross-talks with! AM & phytohormone signaling
