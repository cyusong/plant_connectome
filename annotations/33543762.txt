Pectin, a component of the plant cell wall, is involved in cell adhesion and environmental adaptations. We generated OsPG-FOX rice lines with little pectin due to overexpression of the gene encoding a pectin-degrading enzyme [polygalacturonase (PG)]. Overexpression of OsPG2 in rice under weak light conditions increased the activity of PG, which increased the degradation of pectin in the cell wall, thereby reducing adhesion. Under weak light conditions, the overexpression of OsPG decreased the pectin content and cell adhesion, resulting in abnormally large intercellular gaps and facilitating invasion by the rice blast fungus. OsPG2-FOX plants had weaker mechanical properties and greater sensitivity to biotic stresses than wild-type (WT) plants. However, the expression levels of disease resistance genes in non-infected leaves of OsPG2-FOX were more than twice as high as those of the WT and the intensity of disease symptoms was reduced, compared with the WT. Under normal light conditions, overexpression of OsPG2 decreased the pectin content, but did not affect cell adhesion and sensitivity to biotic stresses. Therefore, PG plays a role in regulating intercellular adhesion and the response to biotic stresses in rice.
