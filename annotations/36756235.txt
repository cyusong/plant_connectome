Peanut is an important food and feed crop, providing oil and protein nutrients. Germins and germin-like proteins (GLPs) are ubiquitously present in plants playing numerous roles in defense, growth and development, and different signaling pathways. However, the GLP members have not been comprehensively studied in peanut at the genome-wide scale. We carried out a genome-wide identification of the <i>GLP</i> genes in peanut genome. <i>GLP</i> members were identified comprehensively, and gene structure, genomic positions, motifs/domains distribution patterns, and phylogenetic history were studied in detail. Promoter Cis-elements, gene duplication, collinearity, miRNAs, protein-protein interactions, and expression were determined. A total of 84 <i>GLPs</i> (<i>AhGLPs</i> ) were found in the genome of cultivated peanut. These <i>GLP</i> genes were clustered into six groups. Segmental duplication events played a key role in the evolution of <i>AhGLPs</i>, and purifying selection pressure was underlying the duplication process. Most <i>AhGLPs</i> possessed a well-maintained gene structure and motif organization within the same group. The promoter regions of <i>AhGLPs</i> contained several key cis-elements responsive to 'phytohormones', 'growth and development', defense, and 'light induction'. Seven microRNAs (miRNAs) from six families were found targeting 25 <i>AhGLPs</i>. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that <i>AhGLPs</i> are highly enriched in nutrient reservoir activity, aleurone grain, external encapsulating structure, multicellular organismal reproductive process, and response to acid chemicals, indicating their important biological roles. <i>AhGLP14, AhGLP38, AhGLP54,</i> and <i>AhGLP76</i> were expressed in most tissues, while <i>AhGLP26, AhGLP29,</i> and <i>AhGLP62</i> showed abundant expression in the pericarp. <i>AhGLP7, AhGLP20,</i> and <i>AhGLP21,</i> etc., showed specifically high expression in embryo, while <i>AhGLP12, AhGLP18, AhGLP40, AhGLP78</i>, and <i>AhGLP82</i> were highly expressed under different hormones, water, and temperature stress. The qRT-PCR results were in accordance with the transcriptome expression data. In short, these findings provided a foundation for future functional investigations on the <i>AhGLPs</i> for peanut breeding programs.
