Members of the Low Phosphate Root (LPR) family have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa) and expression analyses have been conducted. Here, we investigated the functions of one of the five members in rice, LPR5. qRT-PCR and promoter-GUS reporter analyses indicated that under Pi-sufficient conditions OsLPR5 was highly expressed in the roots, and specific expression occurred in the leaf collars and nodes, and its expression was increased under Pi-deficient conditions. In vitro analysis of the purified OsLPR5 protein showed that it exhibited ferroxidase activity. Overexpression of OsLPR5 triggered higher ferroxidase activity, and elevated concentrations of Fe(III) in the xylem sap and of total Fe in the roots and shoots. Transient expression of OsLPR5 in Nicotiana benthamiana provided evidence of its subcellular localization to the cell wall and endoplasmic reticulum. Knockout mutation in OsLPR5 by means of CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in adverse effects on Pi translocation, on the relative expression of Cis-NATOsPHO1;2, and on several morphological traits, including root development and yield potential. Our results indicate that ferroxidase-dependent OsLPR5 has both a broad-spectrum influence on growth and development in rice as well as affecting a subset of physiological and molecular traits that govern Pi homeostasis.
