Manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) are essential mineral micronutrients for plants and their deficiency and or toxicity represents a serious agricultural problem. In rice the information about genes involved in Mn uptake from soil is scarce. Recently, we showed that OsNRAMP5 is a plasma membrane protein involved in Mn and Fe transport. The concentration of Mn in roots, shoots and xylem sap of OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants was significantly reduced compared with WT plants. The expression of OsNRAMP5 is not controlled by Fe deficiency in root and was also observed in pistil, ovary, lemma and palea. These data show that rice would utilize OsNRAMP5 for constitutive Fe and Mn uptake, while OsNRAMP5 would also play a role in Fe and Mn transport during flowering and seed development.

OsNRAMP5: !localizes to! pistil, ovary, lemma and palea 
OsNRAMP5: !is not controlled by! Fe deficiency in root 
OsNRAMP5: !reduces! concentration of Mn in roots, shoots and xylem sap
