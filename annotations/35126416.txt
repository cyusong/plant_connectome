Huanglongbing (HLB) has turned into a devastating botanical pandemic of citrus crops, caused by <i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus (<i>C</i>Las). However, until now the disease has remained incurable with very limited control strategies available. Restoration of the affected microbiomes in the diseased host through the introduction of an indigenous endophyte <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> L1-21 isolated from healthy citrus may provide an innovative approach for disease management. A novel half-leaf method was developed <i>in vitro</i> to test the efficacy of the endophyte L1-21 against <i>C</i>Las. Application of <i>B. subtilis</i> L1-21 at 10<sup>4</sup> colony forming unit (cfu ml<sup>-1</sup>) resulted in a 1,000-fold reduction in the <i>C</i>Las copies per gram of leaf midrib (10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup>) in 4 days. In HLB-affected citrus orchards over a period of 2 years, the <i>C</i>Las incidence was reduced to < 3%, and <i>C</i>Las copies declined from 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> of diseased leaf midribs in the endophyte L1-21 treated trees. Reduction in disease incidence may corroborate a direct or an indirect biocontrol effect of the endophytes as red fluorescent protein-labeled <i>B. subtilis</i> L1-21 colonized and shared niche (phloem) with <i>C</i>Las. This is the first large-scale study for establishing a sustainable HLB control strategy through citrus endophytic microbiome restructuring using an indigenous endophyte.
