['23935516', 'Plants have evolved sophisticated systems for adaptation to their natural  habitat. In response to developmental and environmental cues, plants produce and  perceive jasmonate (JA) signals, which induce degradation of JASMONATE-ZIM-Domain  (JAZ) proteins and derepress the JAZ-repressed transcription factors to regulate  diverse aspects of defense responses and developmental processes. Here, we  identified the bHLH subgroup IIId transcription factors (bHLH3, bHLH13, bHLH14  and bHLH17) as novel targets of JAZs. These bHLH subgroup IIId transcription  factors act as transcription repressors and function redundantly to negatively  regulate JA responses. The quadruple mutant bhlh3 bhlh13 bhlh14 bhlh17 showed  severe sensitivity to JA-inhibited root growth and JA-induced anthocyanin  accumulation, and exhibited obvious increase in JA-regulated plant defense  against pathogen infection and insect attack. Transgenic plants overexpressing  bHLH13 or bHLH17 displayed reduced JA responses. Furthermore, these bHLH factors  functioned as transcription repressors to antagonize the transcription  activators, such as MYC2 and the WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complex, through binding to  their target sequences. Coordinated regulation of JA responses by transcription  activators and repressors would benefit plants by allowing fine regulation of  defense and development, and survival in their frequently changing environment.', '2013', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1003653', 'Xie']
