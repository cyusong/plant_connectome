['8776901', 'Chloroplast mutator (chm) of Arabidopsis is a recessive nuclear mutation that  causes green and white variegation in leaves and is inherited in a non-Mendelian  fashion. In this study, we have identified and characterized a mutant observed in  F1 and backcrossed BC1 populations from a cross between chm1-3 and ecotype  Columbia. This mutant, maternal distorted leaf (MDL), grows very poorly and is  distinguished by distorted rough leaves and aborted flowering organs. Electron  microscopic observation showed that in MDL plants, a significant portion of  mitochondria are abnormal and appear to be nonfunctional. DNA gel blot and  sequence analysis of the MDL mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) revealed rearrangements in  two mtDNA fragments associated with rps3-rpl16 genes (encoding ribosomal proteins  S3 and L16, respectively). One rearrangement resulted in the insertion of the  rps3-rpl16 operon downstream of atp9. An independent deletion in this region had  eliminated the majority of rps3. In contrast, another rearrangement deleted part  of rpl16, whereas rps3 remained intact. RNA gel blot analysis indicated that  expression of these genes is also altered as a consequence of the mtDNA  rearrangements. Thus, a mutation at the CHM locus affects mitochondrial gene  expression, and impaired mitochondrial function may result in the distorted  phenotype.', '1996 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.8.8.1377', 'Motoyoshi']
