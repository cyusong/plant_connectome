['28039858', 'Arabidopsis thaliana Stress Associated Protein 9 (AtSAP9) is a member of the  A20/AN1 zinc finger protein family known to play important roles in plant stress  responses and in the mammalian immune response. Although SAPs of several plant  species were shown to be involved in abiotic stress responses, the underlying  molecular mechanisms are largely unknown, and little is known about the  involvement of SAPs in plant disease responses. Expression of SAP9 in Arabidopsis  is up-regulated in response to dehydration, cold, salinity and abscisic acid  (ABA), as well as pathogen infection. Constitutive expression of AtSAP9 in  Arabidopsis leads to increased sensitivity to ABA and osmotic stress during  germination and post-germinative development. Plants that overexpress AtSAP9 also  showed increased susceptibility to infection by non-host pathogen Pseudomonas  syringae pv. phaseolicola, indicating a potential role of AtSAP9 in disease  resistance. AtSAP9 was found to interact with RADIATION SENSITIVE23d (Rad23d), a  shuttle factor for the transport of ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome,  and it is co-localized with Rad23d in the nucleus. Thus, AtSAP9 may promote the  protein degradation process by mediating the interaction of ubiquitinated targets  with Rad23d. Taken together, these results indicate that AtSAP9 regulates abiotic  and biotic stress responses, possibly via the ubiquitination/proteasome pathway.', '2017 May', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.12892', 'ORCID:']
