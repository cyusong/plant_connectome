Geminiviruses are a large group of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect plants and cause severe agricultural losses worldwide. Given geminiviruses only have small genomes that encode a few proteins, viral factors have to interact with host components to establish an environment suitable for virus infection, whilst the host immunity system recognizes and targets these viral components during infection. Post-translational protein modifications, such as phosphorylation, lipidation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, acetylation and methylation, have been reported to be critical during the interplay between host plants and geminiviruses. Here we summarize the research progress, including phosphorylation and lipidation which usually control the activity and localization of viral factors; as well as ubiquitination and histone modification which are predominantly interfered with by viral components. We also discuss the dynamic competition on protein modifications between host defence and geminivirus efficient infection, as well as potential applications of protein modifications in geminivirus resistance. The summary and perspective of this topic will improve our understanding on the mechanism of geminivirus-plant interaction and contribute to further protection of plants from virus infection.
