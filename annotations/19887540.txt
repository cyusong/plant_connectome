We have isolated a combination of high-light and heat-shock (HL + HS) stress-inducible genes, including a NAC transcription factor designated ANAC078. Here we explored the physiological function of ANAC078 under HL stress. Yeast transcription activity assays showed that ANAC078 functions as a transcriptional activator. A fusion protein composed of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and full-length ANAC078 was detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm, while fusion proteins comprising GFP and ANAC078 deleted of a putative transmembrane motif were found only in the nucleus. In ANAC078-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants (Ox-ANAC078-43), the transcription of 166 genes was up-regulated compared with the levels in wild-type plants under HL (1200 micromol m(-2) s(-1), 30 degrees C). These genes included some for transcription factors regulating the expression of genes related to the biosynthesis of flavonoids. Interestingly, the transcript levels of some genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis and the levels of anthocyanins were significantly increased in Ox-ANAC078 plants and reduced in knockout ANAC078 plants (KO-ANAC078) compared with wild-type plants under HL stress. The present findings suggest that ANAC078 protein is associated with the induction of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis, leading to the accumulation of anthocyanins, in response to HL stress.
