Isochorismate synthase (ICS) plays an essential role in the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and plant disease resistance. Diseases caused by Botryosphaeria dothidea affect apple yields. Thus, it is important to understand the role of ICS1 in disease resistance to B. dothidea in apple. In this study, SA treatment enhanced the resistance to B. dothidea. MdICS1 was induced by B. dothidea and enhanced the resistance to B. dothidea. MdICS1 promoter analysis indicated that the W-box was vital for the response to B. dothidea treatment. MdWRKY15 was found to interact with the W-box using yeast one-hybrid screening. Subsequently, the interaction was confirmed by EMSA, yeast one-hybrid, ChIP-PCR, and quantitative PCR assays. Moreover, luciferase and GUS analysis further indicated that MdICS1 was transcriptionally activated by MdWRKY15. Finally, we found the function of MdWRKY15 in the resistance to B. dothidea was partially dependent on MdICS1 from the phenotype of transgenic apples and calli. In summary, we revealed that MdWRKY15 activated the transcription of MdICS1 by directly binding to its promoter to increase the accumulation of SA and the expression of disease-related genes, thereby resulting in the enhanced resistance to B. dothidea in the SA biosynthesis pathway.
