In all plants and algae, most plastid proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and, consequently, need to be transported into plastids across multiple membranes. In organisms with secondary plastids, which evolved by secondary endosymbioses, and are surrounded by three or four envelope membranes, precursors of nuclear-encoded plastid proteins generally have an N-terminal bipartite targeting sequence that consists of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting signal peptide (SP) and a transit peptide-like (TPL) sequence. The bipartite targeting sequences have been demonstrated to be necessary and sufficient for targeting proteins into the plastids of many algal groups, including chlorarachniophytes. Here, we report a new type of targeting signal that is required for delivering a RubisCO small subunit (RbcS) protein into the secondary plastids of chlorarachniophyte algae. In this study, we analyzed the plastid-targeting ability of an RbcS pre-protein, using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter molecule in chlorarachniophyte cells. We demonstrate that the N-terminal bipartite targeting sequence of the RbcS pre-protein is not sufficient, and that a part of the mature protein is also necessary for plastid targeting. By deletion analyses of amino acids, we determined the approximate location of an internal plastid-targeting signal within the mature protein, which is involved in targeting the protein from the ER into the chlorarachniophyte plastids.
