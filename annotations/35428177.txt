Glutamate receptor-like (GLR) channels are plant homologs of iGluRs, animal ionotropic glutamate receptors which participate in neurotransmission. GLRs mediate plant adaptive processes and photomorphogenesis. Despite their contribution to light-dependent processes, signaling mechanisms that modulate GLR response to light remain unknown. Here we show that leaf expression of 7 out of 20 Arabidopsis GLRs is significantly up-regulated by monochromatic irradiation. Our data indicates that both red and blue light stimulate the expression of selected AtGLRs. Using a photosynthesis inhibitor and different irradiation regimes, we demonstrated that retrograde signaling from photosystem II is unlikely to be involved in light-dependent GLR up-regulation. Analysis of transcriptional patterns in mutants of key photoreceptors allowed us to observe that both phytochromes and cryptochromes are likely to be involved in the control of light-dependent up-regulation of AtGLR expression, with phytochromes playing a clearly dominating role in this process. In mature Arabidopsis leaves, phytochromes, assisted by cryptochromes, mediate light-driven transcriptional up-regulation of several genes encoding GLR proteins. Since GLRs are known to be involved in a wide range of plant developmental processes our results provide mechanistic insight into how light may influence plant growth and development.
