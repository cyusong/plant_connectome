Heat stress substantially reduces the yield potential of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), one of the most widely cultivated staple crops, and greatly threatens global food security in the context of global warming. However, few studies have explored the heat stress tolerance (HST)-related genetic resources in wheat. Here, we identified and fine-mapped a wheat HST locus, TaHST2, which is indispensable for HST in both the vegetative and reproductive stages of the wheat life cycle. The studied pair of near isogenic lines (NILs) exhibited diverse morphologies under heat stress, based on which we mapped TaHST2 to a 485 kb interval on chromosome arm 4DS. Under heat stress, TaHST2 confers a superior conversion rate from soluble sugars to starch in wheat grains, resulting in faster grain filling and a higher yield potential. A further exploration of genetic resources indicated that TaHST2 underwent strong artificial selection during wheat domestication, suggesting it is an essential locus for basal HST in wheat. Our findings provide deeper insights into the genetic basis of wheat HST and might be useful for global efforts to breed heat-stress-tolerant cultivars.
