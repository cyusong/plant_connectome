Fungal extracellular vesicles (EVs) were first described in human pathogens. In a few years, the field of fungal EVs evolved to include several studies with plant pathogens, in which extracellularly released vesicles play fundamental biological roles. In recent years, solid progress has been made in the determination of the composition of EVs produced by phytopathogens. In addition, EV biomarkers are now known in fungal plant pathogens, and the production of EVs during plant infection has been demonstrated. In this manuscript, we review the recent progress in the field of fungal EVs, with a focus on plant pathogens.
