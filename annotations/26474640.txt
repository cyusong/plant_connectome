DNA polymerase zeta catalytic subunit REV3 is known to play an important role in the repair of DNA damage induced by cross-linking and methylating agents. Here, we demonstrate that in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the basic polymerase activity of REV3 is essential for resistance protection against these different types of damaging agents. Interestingly, its processivity is mainly required for resistance to interstrand and intrastrand cross-linking agents, but not alkylating agents. To better define the role of REV3 in relation to other key factors involved in DNA repair, we perform epistasis analysis and show that REV3-mediated resistance to DNA-damaging agents is independent of the replication damage checkpoint kinase ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and rad3-related homolog. REV3 cooperates with the endonuclease MMS and UV-sensitive protein81 in response to interstrand cross links and alkylated bases, whereas it acts independently of the ATP-dependent DNA helicase RECQ4A. Taken together, our data show that four DNA intrastrand cross-link subpathways exist in Arabidopsis, defined by ATP-dependent DNA Helicase RECQ4A, MMS and UV-sensitive protein81, REV3, and the ATPase Radiation Sensitive Protein 5A.
