High temperature (HT) is becoming an increasingly serious factor in limiting crop production with global climate change. During hot seasons, owing to prevailing HT, cultivated tomatoes are prone to exhibiting stigma exsertion, which hampers pollination and causes fruit set failure. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the HT-induced stigma exsertion remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that stigma exsertion induced by HT in cultivated tomato is caused by more seriously shortened stamens than pistils, which is different from the stigma exsertion observed in wild tomato species. Under the HT condition, the different responses of pectin, sugar, expansin, and cyclin cause cell wall remodelling and differentially localized cell division and selective cell enlargement, which further determine the lengths of stamens and pistils. In addition, auxin and jasmonate (JA) are implicated in regulating cell division and cell expansion in stamens and pistils, and exogenous JA instead of auxin treatment can effectively rescue tomato stigma exsertion through regulating the JA/COI1 signalling pathway. Our findings provide a better understanding of stigma exsertions under the HT condition in tomato and uncover a new function of JA in improving plant abiotic stress tolerance.
