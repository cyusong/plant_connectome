Shortly after the release of singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) in chloroplasts, changes in nuclear gene expression occur in the conditional flu mutant of Arabidopsis that reveal a rapid transfer of signals from the plastid to the nucleus. Extensive genetic screens aimed at identifying constituents involved in (1)O(2)-mediated plastid-to-nucleus signaling have failed to identify extraplastidic signaling components. This finding suggests that (1)O(2)-mediated signals are not translocated to the nucleus via a single linear pathway, but rather through a signaling network that is difficult to block by single mutations. The complexity of this signaling network has been tackled by mutagenizing a transgenic flu line expressing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the promoter of a (1)O(2)-responsive AAA-ATPase gene (At3g28580) and isolating second site mutants that constitutively express the reporter gene at a high level. One of the mutants was shown by map-based cloning and sequencing to contain a single amino acid change in the PLEIOTROPIC RESPONSE LOCUS 1 (PRL1) protein. PRL1 suppresses the expression of AAA-ATPase and other (1)O(2)-responsive genes. PRL1 seems to play a major role in modulating responses of plants to environmental changes by interconnecting (1)O(2)-mediated retrograde signaling with other signaling pathways.
