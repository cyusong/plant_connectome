The Elongator complex interacts with RNA polymerase II and via histone acetylation and DNA demethylation facilitates epigenetically the transcription of genes involved in diverse processes in plants, including growth, development, and immune response. Recently, we have shown that the Elongator complex promotes hypocotyl elongation and photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana by regulating the photomorphogenesis and growth-related gene network that converges on genes implicated in cell wall biogenesis and hormone signaling. Here, we report that germination in the elo mutant was delayed by 6 h in the dark when compared to the wild type in a time lapse and germination assay. A number of germination-correlated genes were down-regulated in the elo transcriptome, suggesting a transcriptional regulation by Elongator. We also show that the hypocotyl elongation defect observed in the elo mutants in darkness originates very early in the post-germination development and is independent from the germination delay.
