['21692805', 'Copper is an essential micronutrient for all organisms because it serves as a  cofactor of several proteins involved in electron transfer. Elevated copper  concentrations can cause toxic effects and organisms have established suitable  mechanisms to regulate the uptake and internal distribution of copper to balance  the content at an optimal concentration. In recent studies, a family of copper  transporters (COPT) with high homology to other eukaryotic copper transporters  (Ctr) has been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study we clarified the  physiological function of COPT5. This carrier is located in the tonoplast and  functions as a vacuolar copper exporter. Mutants lacking this transporter have  altered copper contents in different organs when compared with wild-type plants.  We were able to detect copper accumulation in the root and a decreased copper  content in siliques and seeds when the COPT5 gene is mutated by T-DNA insertion.  Vacuoles purified from copt5 T-DNA-insertion mutants show remarkably increased  copper concentrations compared with wild-type organelles. We assume that on the  cellular level COPT5 is important for copper export from the vacuole and on the  level of the whole plant it is involved in the interorgan reallocation of copper  ions from the root to reproductive organs.', '2011 Oct', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03798.x', 'Trentmann']
