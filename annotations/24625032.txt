Bacteria from the genus Dickeya (formerly Erwinia chrysanthemi) are plant pathogens causing severe diseases in many economically important crops. A majority of the strains responsible for potato disease in Europe belong to a newly identified Dickeya solani species. Although some ecological and epidemiological studies have been carried out, little is known about the regulation of D. solani virulence. The characterization of four D. solani strains indicates significant differences in their virulence on potato, although they are genetically similar based on genomic fingerprinting profiles. A phenotypic examination included an analysis of virulence on potato; growth rate in culture; motility; Fe3+ chelation; and pectate lyase, cellulase, protease, biosurfactant, and blue pigment production. Mutants of four D. solani strains were constructed by inactivating the genes coding either for one of the main negative regulators of D. dadantii virulence (kdgR, pecS, and pecT) or for the synthesis and perception of signaling molecules (expI and expR). Analysis of these mutants indicated that PecS, PecT, and KdgR play a similar role in both species, repressing, to different degrees, the synthesis of virulence factors. The thermoregulator PecT seems to be a major regulator of D. solani virulence. This work also reveals the role of quorum sensing mediated by ExpI and ExpR in D. solani virulence on potato.

KdgR: !represses! virulence factors
PecS: !represses! virulence factors
PecT: !represses! virulence factors
ExpI: !mediates! quorum sensing
ExpR: !mediates! quorum sensing
