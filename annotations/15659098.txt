['15659098', 'Cullin proteins, which belong to multigenic families in all eukaryotes, associate  with other proteins to form ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s) that target  substrates for proteolysis by the 26S proteasome. Here, we present the molecular  and genetic characterization of a plant Cullin3. In contrast to fungi and  animals, the genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains two related  CUL3 genes, called CUL3A and CUL3B. We found that CUL3A is ubiquitously expressed  in plants and is able to interact with the ring-finger protein RBX1. A genomic  search revealed the existence of at least 76 BTB-domain proteins in Arabidopsis  belonging to 11 major families. Yeast two-hybrid experiments indicate that  representative members of certain families are able to physically interact with  both CUL3A and CUL3B, suggesting that Arabidopsis CUL3 forms E3 protein complexes  with certain BTB domain proteins. In order to determine the function of CUL3A, we  used a reverse genetic approach. The cul3a null mutant flowers slightly later  than the control plants. Furthermore, this mutant exhibits a reduced sensitivity  of the inhibition of hypocotyl growth in far-red light and miss-expresses COP1.  The viability of the mutant plants suggests functional redundancy between the two  CUL3 genes in Arabidopsis.', '2005 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02302.x', 'Genschik']
