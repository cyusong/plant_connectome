Among phosphate (P) fertilizers, polyphosphates (PolyPs) have shown promising results in terms of crop yield and plant P nutrition. However, compared to conventional P inputs, very little is known on the impact of PolyPs fertilizers on below- and above-ground plant functional traits involved in P acquisition. This study aims to evaluate agro-physiological responses of durum wheat variety ´Karim´ under different PolyPs applications. Three PolyPs fertilizers (PolyA, PolyB, and PolyC) versus one orthophosphate (OrthoP) were applied at three doses; 30 (D30), 60 (D60), and 90 (D90) kg P/ha under controlled conditions. The PolyPs (especially PolyB and PolyC) application at D60 significantly increased morphophysiological root traits (e.g., RL: 42 and 130%; RSA:40 and 60%), shoot inorganic P (Pi) content (159 and 88%), and root P acquisition efficiency (471 and 296%) under PolyB and PolyC, respectively compared to unfertilized plants. Above-ground physiological parameters, mainly nutrient acquisition, chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were also improved under PolyB and PolyA application at D60. A significant and positive correlation between shoot Pi content and rhizosphere soil acid phosphatase activity was observed, which reveal the key role of these enzymes in PolyPs (A and B) use efficiency. Furthermore, increased P uptake/RL ratio along with shoot Pi indicates more efficient P allocation to shoots with less investment in root biomass production under PolyPs (especially A and B). Under our experimental conditions, these findings report positive impacts of PolyPs on wheat growth performance, particularly on photosynthesis and nutrient acquisition at D60, along with modulation of root morpho-physiological traits likely responsible of P acquisition efficiency.
