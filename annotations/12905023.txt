['12905023', 'DNA homologous to the yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) protein kinase gene,  GCN2, was amplified from arabidopsis [ Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.] RNA and  given the name AtGCN2. The AtGCN2 peptide sequence included adjacent protein  kinase and histidyl tRNA synthetase-like domains and showed 45% sequence identity  with the GCN2 peptide sequence in the protein kinase domain. AtGCN2 transcripts  were detectable in RNA from roots, leaves, stems, buds, flowers, siliques and  seedlings. GCN2 is required for yeast cells to respond to amino acid starvation.  Expression of AtGCN2 in yeast gcn2 mutants complemented the mutation, enabling  growth in the presence of sulfometuron methyl, an inhibitor of branched-chain  amino acid biosynthesis, and 3-aminotriazole, an inhibitor of histidine  biosynthesis.', '2003 Aug', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-003-1025-4', 'Halford']
