The soluble protein fraction of fully developed potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers is dominated by patatin, a 40 kD storage glycoprotein, and protease inhibitors. Potato multicystatin (PMC) is a multidomain Cys-type protease inhibitor. PMC effectively inhibits degradation of patatin by tuber proteases in vitro. Herein we show that changes in PMC, patatin concentration, activities of various proteases, and their gene expression are temporally linked during tuber development, providing evidence that PMC has a role in regulating tuber protein content in vivo. PMC was barely detectable in non-tuberized stolons. PMC transcript levels increased progressively during tuberization, concomitant with a 40-fold increase in PMC concentration (protein basis) as tubers developed to 10 g fresh wt. Further increases in PMC were comparatively modest (3.7-fold) as tubers developed to full maturity (250 g). Protease activity declined precipitously as PMC levels increased during tuberization. Proteolytic activity was highest in non-tuberized stolons and fell substantially through the 10-g fresh wt stage. Cys-type proteases dominated the pre-tuberization and earliest stages of tuber development. Increases in patatin transcript levels during tuberization were accompanied by a notable lag in patatin accumulation. Patatin did not begin to accumulate substantially on a protein basis until tubers had reached the 10-g stage, wherein protease activity had been inhibited by approximately 60%. These results indicate that a threshold level of PMC (ca. 3 microg tuber(-1), 144 ng mg(-1) protein) is needed to favor patatin accumulation. Collectively, these results are consistent with a role for PMC in facilitating the accumulation of proteins in developing tubers by inhibiting Cys-type proteases.
