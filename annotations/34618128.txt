The energy allocation for vegetative and reproductive growth is regulated by developmental signals and environmental cues, which subsequently affects seed output. However, the molecular mechanism underlying how plants coordinate yield-related traits to control yield in changing source-sink relationships remains largely unknown. Here, we discovered the lectin receptor-like kinase LecRK-VIII.2 as a specific receptor-like kinase that coordinates silique number, seed size, and seed number to determine seed yield in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The lecrk-VIII.2 mutants develop smaller seeds, but more siliques and seeds, leading to increased yield. In contrast, the plants overexpressing LecRK-VIII.2 form bigger seeds, but less siliques and seeds, which results in similar yield to that of wild-type plants. Interestingly, LecRK-VIII.2 promotes the growth of the rosette, root, and stem by coordinating the source-sink relationship. Additionally, LecRK-VIII.2 positively regulates cell expansion and proliferation in the seed coat, and maternally controls seed size. The genetic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that LecRK-VIII.2 acts upstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene MPK6 to regulate silique number, seed size, and seed number. Collectively, these findings uncover LecRK-VIII.2 as an upstream component of the MAPK signaling pathway to control yield-related traits and suggest its potential for crop improvement aimed at developing plants with stable yield, a robust root system, and improved lodging resistance.
