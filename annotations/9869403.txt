['9869403', 'The interaction between Arabidopsis and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris  (Xcc) provides a useful model system to identify components that are involved in  incompatible interactions of this phytopathogen and cruciferous plants. We have  previously described a new gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, ECS1 (formerly  CXC750), which showed an ecotype-specific expression pattern, although homologous  sequences are present in the genomes of all ecotypes tested. Interestingly, ECS1  mRNA transcripts were only detected in ecotypes which showed the resistant  phenotype against Xcc race 750. Subsequent genetic studies with F3 progeny of a  cross between a Xcc750 resistant ecotype (Col-0) and a Xcc750 sensitive ecotype  (Oy-0) revealed segregation of the ECS1RNA-phenotype away from the Xcc750  susceptible phenotype in one out of 16 F3 families. In addition, transformation  of Xcc750 sensitive plants that did not express ECS1, with a constitutively  transcribed ECS1 gene, did not lead to the resistant phenotype in the transgenic  plants. From these results we conclude that ECS1 is not a Xcc750 resistance gene,  but the genetic data indicate that ECS1 is linked to a locus influencing  resistance to Xcc750. ECS1 was localized to YACs 3H12 and 12F3 of the CIC  library, which map to chromosome 1. Subcellular localization of the gene product  indicated that the ECS1 protein is associated with the plant cell wall. Further  molecular investigation of 10 ecotypes revealed the utility of ECS1 as a new  marker for chromosome 1, which is detectable by RFLP, PCR or expression analysis.', '1998 Dec', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1006028605413', 'Grimm']
