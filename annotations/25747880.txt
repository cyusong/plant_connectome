The evolutionary dynamics of duplicated protein-encoding genes (PEGs) is well documented. However, the evolutionary patterns and consequences of duplicated MIRNAs and the potential influence on the evolution of their PEG targets are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the evolution of plant MIRNAs subsequent to a recent whole-genome duplication. Overall, the retention of MIRNA duplicates was correlated to the retention of adjacent PEG duplicates, and the retained MIRNA duplicates exhibited a higher level of interspecific preservation of orthologs than singletons, suggesting that the retention of MIRNA duplicates is related to their functional constraints and local genomic stability. Nevertheless, duplication status, rather than local genic collinearity, was the primary determinant of levels of nucleotide divergence of MIRNAs. In addition, the retention of duplicated MIRNAs appears to be associated with the retention of their corresponding duplicated PEG targets. Furthermore, we characterized the evolutionary novelty of a legume-specific microRNA (miRNA) family, which resulted from rounds of genomic duplication, and consequent dynamic evolution of its NB-LRR targets, an important gene family with primary roles in plant-pathogen interactions. Together, these observations depict evolutionary patterns and novelty of MIRNAs in the context of genomic duplication and evolutionary interplay between MIRNAs and their PEG targets mediated by miRNAs.
