The <i>siz1</i> mutants exhibit high SA accumulation and consequently severe dwarfism. Although <i>siz1</i> mutants exhibit growth recovery upon exogenous ammonium supply, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of ammonium on SA level and plant growth in SA-accumulating mutants. The growth of <i>siz1-2</i> and <i>siz1-3</i> mutants was recovered to wild-type (WT) levels upon exogenous ammonium supply, but that of <i>siz1-3 ndr1</i> (<i>non-race-specific disease resistance 1</i>) and <i>siz1-3 npr1</i> (<i>non-expressor of pathogenesis related gene 1</i>) double mutants was unaffected. The SA level was decreased by exogenous ammonium application in <i>siz1-3 ndr1, siz1-3 npr1</i>, and <i>siz1-3</i> mutants. The level of nitrate reductase (NR) was almost the same in all genotypes (WT, <i>siz1-3, ndr1, npr1, siz1-3 ndr1</i>, and <i>siz1-3 npr1</i>), regardless of the ammonium treatment, suggesting that exogenous ammonium supply to <i>ndr1 siz1-3</i> and <i>npr1 siz1-3</i> double mutants does not have any effect on their growth and NR levels, but decreases the SA level. Taken together, these results indicate that ammonium acts as a signaling molecule to regulate the SA amount, and NDR1 and NPR1 play a positive role in the ammonium-mediated growth recovery of <i>siz1</i> mutants.
