"Priming" in plant phytopathology describes a phenomenon where the "experience" of primary infection by microbial pathogens leads to enhanced and beneficial protection of the plant against secondary infection. The plant is able to establish an immune memory, a state of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), in which the information of "having been attacked" is integrated with the action of "being prepared to defend when it happens again." Accordingly, primed plants are often characterized by faster and stronger activation of immune reactions that ultimately result in a reduction of pathogen spread and growth. Prerequisites for SAR are (a) the initiation of immune signalling subsequent to pathogen recognition, (b) a rapid defence signal propagation from a primary infected local site to uninfected distal parts of the plant, and (c) a switch into an immune signal-dependent establishment and subsequent long-lasting maintenance of phytohormone salicylic acid-based systemic immunity. Here, we provide a summary on protein kinases that contribute to these three conceptual aspects of "priming" in plant phytopathology, complemented by data addressing the role of protein kinases crucial for immune signal initiation also for signal propagation and SAR.
