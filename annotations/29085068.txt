['29085068', 'The outermost cell layer of plant roots (epidermis) constantly encounters  environmental challenges. The epidermal outer plasma membrane domain harbours the  PENETRATION3 (PEN3)/ABCG36/PDR8 ATP-binding cassette transporter that confers  non-host resistance to several pathogens. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis  ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM-ARRESTED PEN3 (EAP3) BTB/POZ-domain protein specifically  mediates PEN3 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and confers resistance to a  root-penetrating fungus, providing prime evidence for BTB/POZ-domain  protein-dependent membrane trafficking underlying disease resistance.', '2017 Nov', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/s41477-017-0039-z', 'ORCID:']
