Plants infected with DNA viruses produce massive quantities of virus-derived, 24-nucleotide short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which can potentially direct viral DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing. However, growing evidence indicates that the circular double-stranded DNA accumulating in the nucleus for Pol II-mediated transcription of viral genes is not methylated. Hence, DNA viruses most likely evade or suppress RNA-directed DNA methylation. This review describes the specialized mechanisms of replication and silencing evasion evolved by geminiviruses and pararetoviruses, which rescue viral DNA from repressive methylation and interfere with transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing of viral genes.

geminiviruses: !evade! DNA methylation
pararetoviruses: !evade! DNA methylation
siRNAs: !direct! viral DNA methylation
Pol II: !mediates! transcription of viral genes
viral DNA: !rescued from! repressive methylation
viral genes: !interfered with! transcriptional silencing
viral genes: !interfered with! post-transcriptional silencing
