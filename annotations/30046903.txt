Attenuation in the activity of the negative regulators or the hyperactivity of plant innate immune receptors often causes ectopic defense activation manifested in severe growth retardation and spontaneous lesion formations, referred to as autoimmunity. In this review, we have described the cellular and molecular basis of the development of autoimmune responses for their useful applications in plant defense. Plants are exposed to diverse disease-causing pathogens, which bring infections by taking over the control on host immune machineries. To counter the challenges of evolving pathogenic races, plants recruit specific types of intracellular immune receptors that mostly belong to the family of polymorphic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins. Upon recognition of effector molecules, NLR triggers hyperimmune signaling, which culminates in the form of a typical programmed cell death, designated hypersensitive response. Besides, few plant NLRs also guard certain host proteins known as 'guardee' that are modified by effector proteins. However, this fine-tuned innate immune system can be lopsided upon knock-out of the alleles that correspond to the host guardees, which mimick the presence of pathogen. The absence of pathogens causes inappropriate activation of the respective NLRs and results in the constitutive activation of plant defense and exhibiting autoimmunity. In plants, autoimmune mutants are readily scorable due to their dwarf phenotype and development of characteristic macroscopic disease lesions. Here, we summarize recent reports on autoimmune response in plants, how it is triggered, and phenotypic consequences associated with this phenomenon.

NLR: !triggers! hypersensitive response 
NLR: !guards! host proteins 
knock-out of alleles: !mimicks! presence of pathogen 
autoimmune mutants: !exhibit! dwarf phenotype 
autoimmune mutants: !develop! characteristic macroscopic disease lesions
