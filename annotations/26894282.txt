Endosymbiosis interactions allow plants to grow in nutrient-deficient soil environments. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is an ancestral interaction between land plants and fungi, whereas nitrogen-fixing symbioses are highly specific for certain plants, notably major crop legumes. The signaling pathways triggered by specific lipochitooligosaccharide molecules involved in these interactions have common components that also overlap with plant root development. These pathways include receptor-like kinases, transcription factors (TFs), and various intermediate signaling effectors, including noncoding (nc)RNAs. These latter molecules have emerged as major regulators of gene expression and small ncRNAs, composed of micro (mi)RNAs and small interfering (si)RNAs, are known to control gene expression at transcriptional (chromatin) or posttranscriptional levels. In this review, we describe exciting recent data connecting variants of conserved si/miRNAs with the regulation of TFs, such as NSP2, NFY-A1, auxin-response factors, and AP2-like proteins, known to be involved in symbiosis. The link between hormonal regulations and these si- and miRNA-TF nodes is proposed in a model in which different feedback loops or regulations controlling endosymbiosis signaling are integrated. The diversity and emerging regulatory networks of young legume miRNAs are also highlighted.
