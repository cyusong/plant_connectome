['17407539', 'Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are Zn-containing metalloenzymes that catalyse the  reversible hydration of CO(2). We investigated the alphaCA and betaCA families in  Arabidopsis, which contain eight alphaCA (At alphaCA1-8) and six betaCA genes (At  betaCA1-6). Analyses of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from The Arabidopsis  Information Resource (TAIR) database indicate that all the betaCA encoding  sequences, but only three of the At alphaCA, are expressed. Using  semi-quantitative PCR experiments, functional CA genes were more strongly  expressed in green tissue, but strong expression was also found in roots for  betaCA3, betaCA6 and alphaCA2. Two alphaCA genes were shown to respond to the  CO(2) environment, while the others were unresponsive. Using the green  fluorescent reporter protein gene fused with cDNA sequences coding for betaCAs,  we provided evidence that betaCAs were targeted to specific subcellular  compartments: betaCA1 and betaCA5 were targeted to the chloroplast, betaCA2 and  betaCA3 to the cytosol, betaCA4 to the plasma membrane and betaCA6 to the  mitochondria. The targeting and the pattern of gene expression suggest that CA  isoforms play specific roles in subcellular compartments, tissues and organs. The  data indicate that other CA isoforms than the well-characterized betaCA1 may  contribute to the CO(2) transfer in the cell to the catalytic site of ribulose  1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco).', '2007 May', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/j.1365-3040.2007.01651.x', 'Rumeau']
