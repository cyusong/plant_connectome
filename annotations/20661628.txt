Auxin regulates gene expression through direct physical interaction with TIR1/AFB receptor proteins during different processes of growth and development in plants. Here we report the contribution of auxin signaling pathway to the adaptative response against abiotic stress in Arabidopsis. Phenotypic characterization of tir1/afb auxin receptor mutants indicates a differential participation of each member under abiotic stress. In particular, tir1 afb2 and tir1 afb3 mutants resulted more tolerant to oxidative stress. In addition, tir1 afb2 showed increased tolerance against salinity measured as chlorophyll content, germination rate and root elongation compared with wild-type plants. Furthermore, tir1 afb2 displayed a reduced accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion, as well as enhanced antioxidant enzymes activities under stress. A higher level of ascorbic acid was detected in tir1 afb2 compared with wild-type plants. Thus, adaptation to salinity in Arabidopsis may be mediated in part by an auxin/redox interaction.
