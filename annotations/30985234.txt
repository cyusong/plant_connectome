The influences of stem flexure on shade-grown <i>Serianthes nelsonii</i> Merr. stem growth and strength were determined in a container nursery setting. Treated stems were bent 90° two times daily for a 14 wk nursery production period. Plant height, internode length, and slenderness were decreased by stem flexure when compared with control plants that received no flexure. Two force-displacement tests revealed stem strength was increased by the flexure treatment. Control plants exhibited undesirable lean of the main stem, and 1 hr of wind stress further increased the angle of lean. Treated plants were close to orthotropic and the wind stress did not change the stem lean. Results indicate stem flexure is a reliable method for increasing the quality of shade-grown <i>S. nelsonii</i> plants and some form of mechanical stimulation should be added to nursery production protocols for the species.
