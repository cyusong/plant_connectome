Ethylene and melatonin are widely involved in plant development and environmental stress responses. However, the role of their direct relationship in the immune response and the underlying molecular mechanisms in plants remain elusive. Here, we found that Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam) infection increased endogenous ethylene levels, which positively modulated plant disease resistance through activating melatonin accumulation in cassava. In addition, the ethylene-responsive transcription factor ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE LIKE5 (MeEIL5), a positive regulator of disease resistance, was essential for ethylene-induced melatonin accumulation and disease resistance in cassava. Notably, the identification of heat stress transcription factor 20 (MeHsf20) as an interacting protein of MeEIL5 indicated the association between ethylene and melatonin in plant disease resistance. MeEIL5 physically interacted with MeHsf20 to promote the transcriptional activation of the gene encoding N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase 2 (MeASMT2), thereby improving melatonin accumulation. Moreover, MeEIL5 promoted the physical interaction of MeHsf20 and pathogen-related gene 3 (MePR3), resulting in improved anti-bacterial activity of MePR3. This study illustrates the dual roles of MeEIL5 in fine-tuning MeHsf20-mediated coordination of melatonin biosynthesis and anti-bacterial activity, highlighting the ethylene-responsive MeEIL5 as the integrator of ethylene and melatonin signals in the immune response in cassava.
