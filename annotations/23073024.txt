We recently reported that the NAC transcription factor JUNGBRUNNEN1 (JUB1; ANAC042) extends longevity and increases tolerance to heat stress in Arabidopsis thaliana when overexpressed, while the opposite is observed in jub1-1 knock-down lines. Here we extend our previous findings by demonstrating that JUB1 also positively regulates plant survival under heat stress when plants were treated by a prior moderate (and non-lethal) temperature regime (so-called priming). We further find that JUB1 shows thermomemory-related expression, similar to two other genes previously reported to be important for thermopriming, i.e., HSFA2, encoding a heat shock factor, and HSA32, encoding a heat shock protein. Our analysis also identifies ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE2 (APX2) and the heat shock protein genes HSP18.2 and HSP21 as thermomemory-expressed genes, revealing them as new candidates for studies to decode the molecular processes controlling thermopriming.
