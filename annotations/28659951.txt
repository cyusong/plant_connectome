['28659951', 'The ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) gene in Arabidopsis is important for a plethora of  morphological phenotypes. Recently, AN was also reported to be involved in  responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. It encodes a homolog of the animal  C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs). In contrast to animal CtBPs, AN does not  appear to function as a transcriptional co-repressor and instead functions  outside nucleus where it might be involved in Golgi-associated membrane  trafficking. In this study, we report a novel and unexplored role of AN as a  component of stress granules (SGs). Interaction studies identified several RNA  binding proteins that are associated with AN. AN co-localizes with several  messenger ribonucleoprotein granule markers to SGs in a stress dependent manner.  an mutants exhibit an altered SG formation. We provide evidence that the NAD(H)  binding domain of AN is relevant in this context as proteins carrying mutations  in this domain localize to a much higher degree to SGs and strongly reduce AN  dimerization and its interaction with one interactor but not the others. Finally,  we show that AN is a negative regulator of salt and osmotic stress responses in  Arabidopsis suggesting a functional relevance in SGs.', '2017', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2017.01004', 'Hulskamp']
