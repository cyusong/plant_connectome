['10080719', 'With the advance of Arabidopsis as a model system for understanding plant  genetics, development and biochemistry, a detailed description of the genome is  necessary. As such, focused projects are underway to map and sequence the  Arabidopsis nuclear genome. We have characterized a region of chromosome 1,  surrounding the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) locus. Three (RFLP) clones were mapped relative  to clv1-1, and were used to construct an ca. 700 kb yeast artificial chromosome  (YAC) contig. Three cosmids spanning the CLV1 locus were analyzed and ca. 24 kb  of genomic DNA was sequenced, including a continuous stretch of 18 kb. In  addition to generating clones in this region of chromosome 1, we have analyzed  the size, spacing and organization of several contiguous genes.', '1999 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1006127302671', 'Meyerowitz']
