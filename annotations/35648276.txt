Overexpression of a novel geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase gene (WsGGPPS) in planta resulted in increased levels of gibberellic acid and decrease in withanolide content. Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, the herb from family Solanaceae is one of the most treasured medicinal plant used in traditional medicinal systems owing to its unique stockpile of pharmaceutically active secondary metabolites. Phytochemical and pharmacological studies in this plant were well established, but the genes affecting the regulation of biosynthesis of major metabolites were not well elucidated. In this study cloning and functional characterization of a key enzyme in terpenoid biosynthetic pathway viz. geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.29) gene from Withania somnifera was performed. The full length WsGGPPS gene contained 1,104 base pairs that encode a polypeptide of 365 amino acids. The quantitative expression analysis suggested that WsGGPPS transcripts were expressed maximally in flower tissues followed by berry tissues. The expression levels of WsGGPPS were found to be regulated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA). Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic studies suggested that WsGGPPS had close similarities with GGPPS of Solanum tuberosum and Solanum pennellii. The structural analysis provided basic information about three dimensional features and physicochemical parameters of WsGGPPS protein. Overexpression of WsGGPPS in planta for its functional characterization suggested that the WsGGPPS was involved in gibberellic acid biosynthesis.
