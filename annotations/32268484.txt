Alligator weed is reported to have a strong ability to adapt to potassium deficiency (LK) stress. Leaves are the primary organs responsible for photosynthesis of plants. However, quantitative proteomic changes in alligator weed leaves in response to LK stress are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the physiological and proteomic changes in leaves of alligator weed under LK stress. We found that chloroplast and mesophyll cell contents in palisade tissue increased, and that the total chlorophyll content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and net photosynthetic rate (PN) increased after 15 day of LK treatment, but the soluble protein content decreased. Quantitative proteomic analysis suggested that a total of 119 proteins were differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). KEGG analysis suggested that most represented DAPs were associated with secondary metabolism, the stress response, photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and degradation pathway. The proteomic results were verified using parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (PRM-MS) analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)assays. Additional research suggested that overexpression of cationic peroxidase 1 of alligator weed (ApCPX1) in tobacco increased LK tolerance. The seed germination rate, peroxidase (POD) activity, and K<sup>+</sup> content increased, and the hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) content decreased in the three transgenic tobacco lines after LK stress. The number of root hairs of the transgenic line was significantly higher than that of WT, and net K efflux rates were severely decreased in the transgenic line under LK stress. These results confirmed that ApCPX1 played positive roles in low-K<sup>+</sup> signal sensing. These results provide valuable information on the adaptive mechanisms in leaves of alligator weed under LK stress and will help identify vital functional genes to apply to the molecular breeding of LK-tolerant plants in the future.
