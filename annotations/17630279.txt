['17630279', "Wound signaling pathways in plants are mediated by mitogen-activated protein  kinases (MAPKs) and stress hormones, such as ethylene and jasmonates. In  Arabidopsis thaliana, the transmission of wound signals by MAPKs has been the  subject of detailed investigations; however, the involvement of specific  phosphatases in wound signaling is not known. Here, we show that AP2C1, an  Arabidopsis Ser/Thr phosphatase of type 2C, is a novel stress signal regulator  that inactivates the stress-responsive MAPKs MPK4 and MPK6. Mutant ap2c1 plants  produce significantly higher amounts of jasmonate upon wounding and are more  resistant to phytophagous mites (Tetranychus urticae). Plants with increased  AP2C1 levels display lower wound activation of MAPKs, reduced ethylene  production, and compromised innate immunity against the necrotrophic pathogen  Botrytis cinerea. Our results demonstrate a key role for the AP2C1 phosphatase in  regulating stress hormone levels, defense responses, and MAPK activities in  Arabidopsis and provide evidence that the activity of AP2C1 might control the  plant's response to B. cinerea.", '2007 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.049585', 'Meskiene']
