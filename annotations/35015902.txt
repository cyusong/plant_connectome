Pteris vittata is an arsenic (As) hyperaccumulator that can accumulate several thousand mg As kg<sup>-1</sup> DW in aboveground biomass. A key factor for its hyperaccumulation ability is its highly efficient As long-distance translocation system. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. We isolated PvAsE1 through the full-length cDNA over-expression library of P. vittata and characterized it through a yeast system, RNAi gametophytes and sporophytes, subcellular-location and in situ hybridization. Phylogenomic analysis was conducted to estimate the appearance time of PvAsE1. PvAsE1 was a plasma membrane-oriented arsenite (AsIII) effluxer. The silencing of PvAsE1 reduced AsIII long-distance translocation in P. vittata sporophytes. PvAsE1 was structurally similar to solute carrier (SLC)13 proteins. Its transcripts could be observed in parenchyma cells surrounding the xylem of roots. The appearance time was estimated at c. 52.7 Ma. PvAsE1 was a previously uncharacterized SLC13-like AsIII effluxer, which may contribute to AsIII long-distance translocation via xylem loading. PvAsE1 appeared late in fern evolution and might be an adaptive subject to the selection pressure at the Cretaceaou-Paleogene boundary. The identification of PvAsE1 provides clues for revealing the special As hyperaccumulation characteristics of P. vittata.
