Starch synthesis is a key process that influences crop yield and quality, though little is known about the regulation of this complex metabolic pathway. Here, we present the identification of ZmbZIP91 as a candidate regulator of starch synthesis via co-expression analysis in maize (Zea mays L.). ZmbZIP91 was strongly associated with the expression of starch synthesis genes. Reverse tanscription-PCR (RT-PCR) and RNA in situ hybridization indicated that ZmbZIP91 is highly expressed in maize endosperm, with less expression in leaves. Particle bombardment-mediated transient expression in maize endosperm and leaf protoplasts demonstrated that ZmbZIP91 could positively regulate the expression of starch synthesis genes in both leaves and endosperm. Additionally, the Arabidopsis mutant vip1 carried a mutation in a gene (VIP1) that is homologous to ZmbZIP91, displayed altered growth with less starch in leaves, and ZmbZIP91 was able to complement this phenotype, resulting in normal starch synthesis. A yeast one-hybrid experiment and EMSAs showed that ZmbZIP91 could directly bind to ACTCAT elements in the promoters of starch synthesis genes (pAGPS1, pSSI, pSSIIIa, and pISA1). These results demonstrate that ZmbZIP91 acts as a core regulatory factor in starch synthesis by binding to ACTCAT elements in the promoters of starch synthesis genes.
