['22946675', 'The Arabidopsis fruit forms a seedpod that develops from the fertilized  gynoecium. It is mainly comprised of an ovary in which three distinct tissues can  be differentiated: the valves, the valve margins and the replum. Separation of  cells at the valve margin allows for the valves to detach from the replum and  thus dispersal of the seeds. Valves and valve margins are located in lateral  positions whereas the replum is positioned medially and retains meristematic  properties resembling the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Members of the  WUSCHEL-related homeobox family have been involved in stem cell maintenance in  the SAM, and within this family, we found that WOX13 is expressed mainly in  meristematic tissues including the replum. We also show that wox13  loss-of-function mutations reduce replum size and enhance the phenotypes of  mutants affected in the replum identity gene RPL. Conversely, misexpression of  WOX13 produces, independently from BP and RPL, an oversized replum and valve  defects that closely resemble those of mutants in JAG/FIL activity genes. Our  results suggest that WOX13 promotes replum development by likely preventing the  activity of the JAG/FIL genes in medial tissues. This regulation seems to play a  role in establishing the gradient of JAG/FIL activity along the medio-lateral  axis of the fruit critical for proper patterning. Our data have allowed us to  incorporate the role of WOX13 into the regulatory network that orchestrates fruit  patterning.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12010', 'Pelaz']
