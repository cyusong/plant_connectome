One of Anthropocene's most daunting challenges for conservation biology is habitat extinction, caused by rapid global change. Tree diversity has persisted through previous episodes of rapid change, even global extinctions. Given the pace of current change, our management of extant diversity needs to facilitate and even enhance the natural ability of trees to adapt and diversify. Numerous processes contribute to this evolutionary flexibility, including introgression, a widespread yet under-studied process. Reproductive networks, in which species remain distinct despite interspecific gene flow, are called syngameons, a concept largely inspired from work focusing on Quercus. Delineating and analyzing such species groups, empirically and theoretically, will provide insights into the nonadditive effects on evolution of numerous partially interfertile species exchanging genetic material episodically under changing environmental conditions. To conserve tree diversity, crossing experiments designed with an empirical and theoretical understanding of the constituent syngameon should be set up to assist diversification and adaptation in the Anthropocene. Our increasingly detailed knowledge of the oak genome and of oak interspecific and intraspecific phenotypic variation will improve our ability to sustain the diversity of this tree through an unpredictable and unprecedented future.
