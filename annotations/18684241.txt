Leaf gas exchange and leaf water (18)O enrichment (Delta(18)O(L)) were measured in three Clusia species under field conditions during dry and wet seasons and in Miconia argentea during the dry season in the Republic of Panama. During the dry season, all three Clusia species used crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM); during the wet season Clusia pratensis operated in the C(3) mode, while Clusia uvitana and Clusia rosea used CAM. Large departures from isotopic steady state were observed in daytime Delta(18)O(L) of the Clusia species, especially during the dry season. In contrast, daytime Delta(18)O(L) was near isotopic steady state in the C(3) tree M. argentea. Across the full data set, non-steady-state predictions explained 49% of variation in observed Delta(18)O(L), whereas steady-state predictions explained only 14%. During the wet season, when Delta(18)O(L) could be compared with Clusia individuals operating in both C(3) and CAM modes, steady-state and non-steady-state models gave contrasting predictions with respect to interspecific variation in daytime Delta(18)O(L). The observed Delta(18)O(L) pattern matched that predicted for the non-steady state. The results provided a clear example of how non-steady-state control of leaf water (18)O dynamics can shift the slope of the relationship between transpiration rate and daytime Delta(18)O(L) from negative to positive.
