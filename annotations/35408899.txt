Plant disease and insect pests are major limiting factors that reduce crop production worldwide. The ornamental indoor cultivation cash crop dwarf coffee <i>Punica arabica</i> 'Pacas' is also troubled by these issues. Silicon (Si) is one of the most abundant elements in the lithosphere and positively impacts plant health by effectively mitigating biotic and abiotic stresses. Several studies have shown that Si activates plant defense systems, although the specific nature of the involvement of Si in biochemical processes that lead to resistance is unclear. In our study, Si significantly promoted the growth and development of dwarf coffee seedlings grown in plant growth chambers. More than that, through natural infection, Si suppressed disease and insect pests by improving physiology (e.g., the strong development of the internal structures of roots, stems, and leaves; higher photosynthetic efficiency; more abundant organic matter accumulation; the promotion of root activity; the efficient absorption and transfer of mineral elements; and various activated enzymes) and up-regulating defense genes (<i>CaERFTF11</i> and <i>CaERF13</i>). Overall, in agriculture, Si may potentially contribute to global food security and safety by assisting in the creation of enhanced crop types with optimal production as well by mitigating plant disease and insect pests. In this sense, Si is a sustainable alternative in agricultural production.
