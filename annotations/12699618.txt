['12699618', 'BACKGROUND: The genes of the trithorax (trxG) and Polycomb groups (PcG) are best  known for their regulatory functions in Drosophila, where they control homeotic  gene expression. Plants and animals are thought to have evolved multicellularity  independently. Although homeotic genes control organ identity in both animals and  plants, they are unrelated. Despite this fact, several plant homeotic genes are  negatively regulated by plant genes similar to the repressors from the animal  PcG. However, plant-activating regulators of the trxG have not been  characterized. RESULTS: We provide genetic, molecular, functional, and  biochemical evidence that an Arabidopsis gene, ATX1, which is similar to the  Drosophila trx, regulates floral organ development. The effects are specific:  structurally and functionally related flower homeotic genes are under different  control. We show that ATX1 is an epigenetic regulator with histone H3K4  methyltransferase activity. This is the first example of this kind of enzyme  activity reported in plants, and, in contrast to the Drosophila and the yeast  trithorax homologs, ATX1 can methylate in the absence of additional proteins. In  its ability to methylate H3K4 as a recombinant protein, ATX1 is similar to the  human homolog. CONCLUSIONS: ATX1 functions as an activator of homeotic genes,  like Trithorax in animal systems. The histone methylating activity of the  ATX1-SET domain argues that the molecular basis of these effects is the ability  of ATX1 to modify chromatin structure. Our results suggest a conservation of trxG  function between the animal and plant kingdoms despite the different structural  nature of their targets.', '2003 Apr 15', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00243-4', 'Avramova']
