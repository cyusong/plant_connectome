Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) is an important cereal that provides food for more than half of the world's population. Besides grain yield, improving grain quality is also essential to rice breeders. Amylose content (AC), gelatinization temperature (GT) and gel consistency (GC) are considered to be three indicators for cooking and eating quality in rice. Using a genetic map of RILs derived from the super rice Liang-You-Pei-Jiu with high-density SNPs, we detected 3 QTLs for AC, 3 QTLs for GT, and 8 QTLs for GC on chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 12. <i>Wx</i> locus, an important determinator for AC and GC, resided in one QTL cluster for AC and GC, <i>qAC6</i> and <i>qGC6</i> here. And a novel major QTL <i>qGC10</i> on chromosome 10 was identified in both Lingshui and Hangzhou. With the BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>2</sub> population derived from a CSSL harboring the segment for <i>qGC10</i> from 93-11 in PA64s background, it was fine mapped between two molecular markers within 181 kb region with 27 annotated genes. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that eight genes were differentially expressed in endosperm of two parents. After DNA sequencing, only <i>LOC_Os10g04900</i>, which encodes a F-box domain containing protein, has 2 bp deletion in the exon of PA64s, resulting in a premature stop codon. Therefore, <i>LOC_Os10g04900</i> is considered to be the most likely candidate gene for <i>qGC10</i> associated with gel consistency. Identification of <i>qGC10</i> provides a new genetic resource for improvement of rice quality.
