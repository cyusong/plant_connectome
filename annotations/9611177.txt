['9611177', 'Postgenital organ fusion occurs most commonly during reproductive development and  is important in many angiosperms during genesis of the carpel. Although a number  of mutants have been described that manifest ectopic organ fusion, little is  known about the genes involved in regulating this process. In this article we  describe the characterization of a collection of 29 Arabidopsis mutants showing  an organ fusion phenotype. Mapping and complementation analyses revealed that the  mutant alleles define nine different loci distributed throughout the Arabidopsis  genome. Multiple alleles were isolated for the four complementation groups  showing the strongest organ fusion phenotype while the remaining five  complementation groups, all of which show only weak floral organ fusion, have a  single representative allele. In addition to fusion events between aerial parts  of the shoot, some mutants also show abnormal ovule morphology with adjacent  ovules joined together at maturity. Many of the fusion mutants isolated have  detectable differences in the rate at which chlorophyll can be extracted;  however, in one case no difference could be detected between mutant and wild-type  plants. In three mutant lines pollen remained unresponsive to contact with the  mutant epidermis, demonstrating that organ fusion and pollen growth responses can  be genetically separated from one another.', '1998 Jun', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/149.2.607', 'Pruitt']
