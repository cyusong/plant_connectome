Genetic diversities or favorable genes within distantly related species are the important resources for crop genetic improvement and germplasm innovation. Spike-Stalk injection method (SSI) has long been applied in rice genetic improvement by directly introducing genetic materials from non-mating donor species, while its inheritance patterns and the underlying mechanisms are poorly elucidated. In this study, a rice variant <i>ERV1</i> with improved yield-related traits was screened out in the way of introducing genomic DNA of <i>Oryza eichingeri</i> (2n=24, CC genome) into <i>RH78</i> (<i>Oryza sativa L</i>. 2n=24, AA genome) using SSI method. Genome-wide comparison revealed that the genomic heterozygosity of <i>ERV1</i> was approximately 8-fold higher than <i>RH78</i>. Restriction-site associated DNA sequencing technology (RAD-seq) and association analysis of the <i>ERV1</i> inbred F2 population identified 5 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) regions responsible for these yield-related traits, and found that genomic heterozygosity of <i>ERV1</i> inbred lines was significantly lower than <i>ERV1</i>, while spontaneous mutation rate of the <i>ERV1</i> inbred lines was significantly higher than <i>ERV1</i>. Our results preliminarily uncovered the inheritance patterns of SSI variant rice, and the potential genomic regions for traits changes, which yielded novel insights into the mechanisms of SSI method, and may accelerate our understanding of plant genome evolution, domestication, and speciation in nature.
