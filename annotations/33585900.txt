Cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) is a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes the second step of the general phenylpropanoid pathway. Arabidopsis reduced epidermal fluorescence 3 (ref3) mutants, which carry hypomorphic mutations in C4H, exhibit global alterations in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and have developmental abnormalities including dwarfing. Here we report the characterization of a conditional Arabidopsis C4H line (ref3-2pOpC4H), in which wild-type C4H is expressed in the ref3-2 background. Expression of C4H in plants with well-developed primary inflorescence stems resulted in restoration of fertility and the production of substantial amounts of lignin, revealing that the developmental window for lignification is remarkably plastic. Following induction of C4H expression in ref3-2pOpC4H, we observed rapid and significant reductions in the levels of numerous metabolites, including several benzoyl and cinnamoyl esters and amino acid conjugates. These atypical conjugates were quickly replaced with their sinapoylated equivalents, suggesting that phenolic esters are subjected to substantial amounts of turnover in wild-type plants. Furthermore, using localized application of dexamethasone to ref3-2pOpC4H, we show that phenylpropanoids are not transported appreciably from their site of synthesis. Finally, we identified a defective Casparian strip diffusion barrier in the ref3-2 mutant root endodermis, which is restored by induction of C4H expression.
