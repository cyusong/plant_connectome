The molecular mechanisms of signal transduction of plants in response to Verticillium dahliae (VD) are not known. Here, we show that Arabidopsis reacts to VD-toxins with a rapid burst of nitric oxide (NO) and cortical microtubule destabilization. VD-toxins treatment triggered a disruption of cortical microtubules network. This disruption can be influenced by NO production. However, cortical microtubule disruptions were not involved in regulating the NO production. The results indicated that NO may act as an upstream signalling molecule to trigger the depolymerization of cortical microtubule. Cortical microtubules may act as a target of NO signal and as a sensor to mediate the activation of PR-1 gene expression. These results suggested that NO production and cortical microtubule dynamics appeared to be parts of the important signalling system and are involved in the defence mechanisms to VD-toxins in Arabidopsis.

NO: !triggers! cortical microtubule destabilization
cortical microtubules: !sense! NO signal
NO: !activates! PR-1 gene expression
VD-toxins: !disrupts! cortical microtubules network
cortical microtubules: !mediates! PR-1 gene expression
