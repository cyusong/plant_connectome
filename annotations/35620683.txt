Chlorophyll (Chl) plays a crucial role in plant photosynthesis. The geranylgeraniol reductase gene (<i>CHLP</i>) participates in the terminal hydrogenation of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Although there are many studies related to the genome-wide analysis of <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>, little research has been conducted on <i>CHLP</i> family genes, especially those concerning growth and photosynthesis. In this study, three <i>CHLP</i> genes were identified in <i>Populus</i>. The evolutionary tree indicated that the <i>CHLP</i> family genes were divided into six groups. Moreover, one pair of genes was derived from segmental duplications in <i>Populus</i>. Many elements related to growth were detected by <i>cis</i>-acting element analysis of the promoters of diverse <i>PtrCHLPs</i>. Furthermore, <i>PtrCHLPs</i> exhibit different tissue expression patterns. In addition, <i>PtrCHLP3</i> is preferentially expressed in the leaves and plays an important role in regulating chlorophyll biosynthesis. Silencing of <i>PtrCHLP3</i> in poplar resulted in a decrease in chlorophyll synthesis in plants, thus blocking electron transport during photosynthesis. Furthermore, inhibition of <i>PtrCHLP3</i> expression in poplar can inhibit plant growth through the downregulation of photosynthesis. Ultimately, <i>PtrCHLP3</i> formed a co-expression network with photosynthesis and chlorophyll biosynthesis-related genes, which synergistically affected the growth and photosynthesis of poplars. Thus, this study provides genetic resources for the improved breeding of fast-growing tree traits.
