Host jumping is a process by which pathogens settle in new host groups. It is a cornerstone in the evolution of pathogens, as it leads to pathogen diversification. It is unsurprising that host jumping is observed in facultative pathogens, as they can reproduce even if they kill their hosts. However, host jumps were thought to be rare in obligate biotrophic pathogens, but molecular phylogenetics has revealed that the opposite is true. Here, I review some concepts and recent findings and present several hypotheses on the matter. In short, pathogens evolve and diversify via host jumps, followed by radiation, specialisation and speciation. Host jumps are facilitated by, for example, effector innovations, stress, compatible pathogens and physiological similarities. Host jumping, subsequent establishment, and speciation takes place rapidly - within centuries and millennia rather than over millions of years. If pathogens are unable to evolve into neutral or mutualistic interactions with their hosts, they will eventually be removed from the host population, despite balancing trade-offs. Thus, generally, plant pathogens only survive in the course of evolution if they jump hosts. This is also reflected by the diversity patterns observed in many genera of plant pathogens, where it leads to a mosaic pattern of host groups over time, in which the original host group becomes increasingly obscure.
