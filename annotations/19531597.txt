['19531597', 'Transcription of Arabidopsis thaliana seed maturation (MAT) genes is controlled  by members of several transcription factor families, such as basic leucine  zippers (bZIPs), B3s, MYBs, and DOFs. In this work, we identify Arabidopsis  bZIP53 as a novel transcriptional regulator of MAT genes. bZIP53 expression in  developing seeds precedes and overlaps that of its target genes. Gain- and  loss-of-function approaches indicate a correlation between the amount of bZIP53  protein and MAT gene expression. Specific in vivo and in vitro binding of bZIP53  protein to a G-box element in the albumin 2S2 promoter is demonstrated.  Importantly, heterodimerization with bZIP10 or bZIP25, previously described bZIP  regulators of MAT gene expression, significantly enhances DNA binding activity  and produces a synergistic increase in target gene activation. Full-level target  gene activation is strongly correlated with the ratio of the correspondent bZIP  heterodimerization partners. Whereas bZIP53 does not interact with ABI3, a  crucial transcriptional regulator in Arabidopsis seeds, ternary complex formation  between the bZIP heterodimers and ABI3 increases the expression of MAT genes in  planta. We therefore propose that heterodimers containing bZIP53 participate in  enhanceosome formation to produce a dramatic increase in MAT gene transcription.', '2009 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.062968', 'Droge-Laser']
