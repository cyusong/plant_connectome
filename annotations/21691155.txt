The eukaryotic hetrohexameric mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) proteins complex provides DNA unwinding function during the DNA replication. The complex also functions as DNA replication licensing factor which ensures that the DNA in genome is replicated only once per cell division cycle. Recently, a single subunit MCM6 from pea has been shown to contain helicase and ATPase activities in vitro. Recently, the transcript of a single subunit was reported to be upregulated in pea plant in response to high salinity and cold stress and not with ABA, drought and heat stress. The first direct evidence that overexpression of single subunit MCM6 confers salinity stress tolerance without yield loss has also been reported. Here we report the promoter of the pea MCM6 single subunit that contains stress responsive elements which may be responsible for regulating the MCM6 under abiotic stress conditions.
