['31198959', 'Vegetable oils are mainly stored in the form of triacylglycerol (TAG) in  oilseeds. Fatty acids (FAs), one of the building blocks for TAG assembly, are  synthesized in plastids and then exported to the endoplasmic reticulum for  storage oil synthesis. A recent study demonstrated that the export of FAs from  plastids was mediated by a FAX (FA export) family protein. However, the  significance of FAs export from plastid during seed oil accumulation has not been  investigated. In this study, we found that FAX2 was highly expressed in  developing Arabidopsis seeds and the expression level was consistent with FAs  synthesis activity. FAX2 mutant seeds showed an approximately 18% reduction of  lipid levels compared with wild-type seeds. By contrast, overexpression of FAX2  enhanced seed lipid accumulation by up to 30%. The FAs export activity of FAX2  was confirmed by yeast mutant cell complementation analysis. Our results showed  that FAX2 could interact with other proteins to facilitate FAs transport. Taken  together, these results indicate that FAX2-mediated FA export from plastids is  important for seed oil accumulation, and that FAX2 can be used as a target gene  for increasing lipid production in oilseeds.', '2019 Oct 1', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcz117', 'Xu']
