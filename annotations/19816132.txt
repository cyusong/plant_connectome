['19816132', 'Plants use pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to perceive pathogen-associated  molecular pattern (PAMPs) and initiate defence responses. PAMP-triggered immunity  (PTI) plays an important role in general resistance, and constrains the growth of  most microbes on plants. Despite the importance of PRRs in plant immunity, the  vast majority of them remain to be identified. We recently showed that the  Arabidopsis LysM receptor kinase CERK1 is required not only for chitin signalling  and fungal resistance, but plays an essential role in restricting bacterial  growth on plants. We proposed that CERK1 may mediate the perception of a  bacterial PAMP, or an endogenous plant cell wall component released during  infection, through its extracellular carbohydrate-binding LysM-motifs. Here we  report reduced activation of a PAMP-induced defence response on plants lacking  the CERK1 gene after treatment with crude bacterial extracts. This demonstrates  that CERK1 mediates perception of an unknown bacterial PAMP in Arabidopsis.', '2009 Jun', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.4.6.8697', 'Rathjen']
