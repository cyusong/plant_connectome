Secondary wall-associated NAC <i>(SWN)</i> genes are a subgroup of NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factors (TF) that play a key role in regulating secondary cell wall biosynthesis in plants. However, this gene family has not been systematically characterized, and their potential roles in response to hormones are unknown in <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>. In this study, a total of 40 <i>SWN</i> genes, of which 12 from <i>Nicotiana tomentosiformis</i>, 13 from <i>Nicotiana sylvestris</i>, and 15 from <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>, were successfully identified. The 15 <i>SWNs</i> from <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> were further classified into three groups, namely, vascular-related NAC domain genes (<i>NtVNDs</i>), NAC secondary wall thickening promoting factor genes (<i>NtNSTs</i>), and secondary wall-associated NAC domain genes (<i>NtSNDs</i>). The protein characteristic, gene structure, and chromosomal location of 15 <i>NtSWNs</i> (also named <i>Nt1</i> to <i>Nt15</i>) were also analyzed. The <i>NtVND</i> and <i>NtNST</i> group genes had five conserved subdomains in their N-terminal regions and a motif (LP[Q/x] L[E/x] S[P/A]) in their diverged C- terminal regions. Some hormones, dark and low-temperature related <i>cis</i>-acting elements, were significantly enriched in the promoters of <i>NtSWN</i> genes. A comprehensive expression profile analysis revealed that <i>Nt4</i> and <i>Nt12</i> might play a role in vein development. Others might be important for stem development. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that in the <i>NtNST</i> group, genes such as <i>Nt7, Nt8</i>, and <i>Nt13</i> were more sensitive than the genes in <i>NtVND</i> and <i>NtSND</i> groups under abiotic stress conditions. A transactivation assay further suggested that <i>Nt7, Nt8</i>, and <i>Nt13</i> showed a significant transactivation activity. Overall, <i>SWN</i> genes were finally identified and characterized in diploid and tetraploid tobacco, revealing new insights into their evolution, variation, and homology relationships. Transcriptome, <i>cis</i>-acting element, qRT-PCR, and transactivation assay analysis indicated the roles in hormonal and stress responses, which provided further resources in molecular mechanism and genetic improvement.
