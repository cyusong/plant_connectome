['28556304', 'A suppressor mutagenesis screen was conducted in order to identify second site  mutations that could reverse the extreme hypersensitivity to aluminium (Al) seen  for the Arabidopsis mutant, als3-1. From this screen, it was found that a  loss-of-function mutation in the previously described SUV2 (SENSITIVE TO UV 2),  which encodes a putative plant ATRIP homologue that is a component of the  ATR-dependent cell checkpoint response, reversed the als3-1 phenotype. This  included prevention of hallmarks associated with als3-1 including Al-dependent  terminal differentiation of the root tip and transition to endoreduplication.  From this analysis, SUV2 was determined to be required for halting cell cycle  progression and triggering loss of the quiescent centre (QC) following exposure  to Al. In conjunction with this, SUV2 was found to have a similar role as ATR,  ALT2 and SOG1 in Al-dependent stoppage of root growth, all of which are required  for promotion of expression of a suite of genes that likely are part of an  Al-dependent DNA damage transcriptional response. This work argues that these Al  response factors work together to detect Al-dependent damage and subsequently  activate a DNA damage response pathway that halts the cell cycle and subsequently  promotes QC differentiation and entrance into endocycling.', '2017 Sep', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.12992', 'ORCID:']
