In numerous countries, Gaeumannomyces species, within the Magnaporthaceae family, have previously been implicated in the suppression of take-all root disease in wheat. A UK arable isolate collection (n=47) was gathered and shown to contain Gaeumannomyces hyphopodioides and an unnamed Magnaporthaceae species. A novel seedling pot bioassay revealed that both species had a similar ability to colonize cereal roots; however, rye (Secale cereale) was only poorly colonized by the Magnaporthaceae species. To evaluate the ability of 40 elite UK winter wheat cultivars to support soil inoculum of beneficial soil-dwelling fungi, two field experiments were carried out using a naturally infested arable site in south-east England. The elite cultivars grown in the first wheat situation differed in their ability to support G. hyphopodioides inoculum, measured by colonization on Hereward as the subsequent wheat in a seedling soil core bioassay. In addition, the root colonization ability of G. hyphopodioides was influenced by the choice of the second wheat cultivar. Nine cultivars supported the colonization of the beneficial root fungus. Our findings provide evidence of complex host genotype-G. hyphopodioides interactions occurring under field conditions. This new knowledge could provide an additional soil-based crop genetic management strategy to help combat take-all root disease.
