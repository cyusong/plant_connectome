['9405347', 'The NPH1 (nonphototropic hypocotyl 1) gene encodes an essential component acting  very early in the signal-transduction chain for phototropism. Arabidopsis NPH1  contains a serine-threonine kinase domain and LOV1 and LOV2 repeats that share  similarity (36 to 56 percent) with Halobacterium salinarium Bat, Azotobacter  vinelandii NIFL, Neurospora crassa White Collar-1, Escherichia coli Aer, and the  Eag family of potassium-channel proteins from Drosophila and mammals. Sequence  similarity with a known (NIFL) and a suspected (Aer) flavoprotein suggests that  NPH1 LOV1 and LOV2 may be flavin-binding domains that regulate kinase activity in  response to blue light-induced redox changes.', '1997 Dec 19', 'Science', '10.1126/science.278.5346.2120', 'Briggs']
