['18713400', 'During leaf organogenesis, a critical step for normal leaf primordium initiation  is the repression of the class 1 KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) genes. After leaf  primordia are formed, they must establish polarity for normal leaf morphogenesis.  Recent studies have led to the identification of a number of genes that  participate in the class 1 KNOX gene repression and/or the leaf polarity  establishment. ASTMMETRIC LEAVES1 and 2 (AS1 and AS2) are two of these genes,  which are critical for both of these two processes. As a first step towards  understanding the molecular genetic basis of the AS1-AS2 action, we determined  the subcellular localizations of the two proteins in both tobacco BY2 cells and  Arabidopsis plants, by fusing them to yellow/cyan fluorescent protein (YFP/CFP).  Our data showed that AS1 and AS2 alone were predominantly localized in the  nucleolus and the nucleoplasm, respectively. The presence of both AS1 and AS2  proteins in the same interphase cell demonstrated their co-localization in both  nucleolus and nucleoplasm. In addition, AS1 alone was able to associate with the  condensed chromosome in the metaphase cell. Our data suggest that AS1, AS2 and  the AS1-AS2 protein complex may have distinct functions, which are all required  for normal plant development.', '2008 Jul', 'J Integr Plant Biol', '10.1111/j.1744-7909.2008.00693.x', 'Huang']
