['34849721', 'Cell wall modifications are of pivotal importance during plant development. Among  cell wall components, xyloglucans are the major hemicellulose polysaccharide in  primary cell walls of dicots and non-graminaceous monocots. They can connect the  cellulose microfibril surface to affect cell wall mechanical properties. Changes  in xyloglucan structure are known to play an important role in regulating cell  growth. Therefore, the degradation of xyloglucan is an important modification  that alters the cell wall. The alpha-XYLOSIDASE1 (XYL1) gene encodes the only  alpha-xylosidase acting on xyloglucans in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we showed that  mutation of XYL1 strongly influences seed size, seed germination, and fruit  elongation. We found that the expression of XYL1 is directly regulated in  developing seeds and fruit by the MADS-box transcription factor SEEDSTICK. We  demonstrated that XYL1 complements the stk smaller seed phenotype. Finally, by  atomic force microscopy, we investigated the role of XYL1 activity in maintaining  cell stiffness and growth, confirming the importance of cell wall modulation in  shaping organs.', '2022 Mar 2', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erab514', 'ORCID:']
