Efficient amplification and labelling of probes are crucial for successful sequence detection by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). In particular, chromosome painting to visualize chromosome segments or entire chromosomes by FISH requires large amounts of probes derived from extended templates. There are a number of techniques for probe labelling. The most widespread is nick translation, based on the replicational incorporation of modified nucleotides. Here we demonstrate successful rolling-circle amplification (RCA) of very low amounts of long circular template sequences (single bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) or pools of BACs). The amplicons were suitable for labelling by nick translation and subsequent FISH. A novel achievement is the use of RCA for simultaneous amplification and labelling of single BACs or BAC pools in a labour- and cost-effective manner.

RCA: !amplifies! BACs 
Nick translation: !labels! RCA amplicons 
FISH: !visualizes! chromosome segments 
BACs: !amplified and labelled by! RCA and nick translation
