['15710607', 'Piriformospora indica, an endophytic fungus of the Sebacinaceae family, promotes  growth of Arabidopsis and tobacco seedlings and stimulates nitrogen accumulation  and the expression of the genes for nitrate reductase and the starch-degrading  enzyme glucan-water dikinase (SEX1) in roots. Neither growth promotion nor  stimulation of the two enzymes requires heterotrimeric G proteins. P. indica also  stimulates the expression of the uidA gene under the control of the Arabidopsis  nitrate reductase (Nia2) promoter in transgenic tobacco seedlings. At least two  regions (-470/-439 and -103/-89) are important for Nia2 promoter activity in  tobacco roots. One of the regions contains an element, ATGATAGATAAT, that binds  to a homeodomain transcription factor in vitro. The message for this  transcription factor is up-regulated by P. indica. The transcription factor also  binds to a CTGATAGATCT segment in the SEX1 promoter in vitro. We propose that the  growth-promoting effect initiated by P. indica is accompanied by a co-regulated  stimulation of enzymes involved in nitrate and starch metabolisms.', '2005 Jul 15', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M500447200', 'Oelmuller']
