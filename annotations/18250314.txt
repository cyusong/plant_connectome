['18250314', 'Sexual reproduction requires the specification of cells with distinct fates in  plants and animals. The EMS1 (also known as EXS) leucine-rich repeat  receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) and TPD1 small protein play key roles in  regulating somatic and reproductive cell fate determination in Arabidopsis  anthers. Here, we show that ectopic expression of TPD1 causes abnormal  differentiation of somatic and reproductive cells in anthers. In addition,  ectopic TPD1 activity requires functional EMS1. Yeast two-hybrid, pull-down, and  coimmunoprecipitation analyses further demonstrate that TPD1 interacts with EMS1  in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, TPD1 induces EMS1 phosphorylation in planta.  Thus, our results suggest that TPD1 serves as a ligand for the EMS1 receptor  kinase to signal cell fate determination during plant sexual reproduction.', '2008 Feb 12', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0708795105', 'Zhao']
