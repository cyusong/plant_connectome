Molecular genetic studies using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system have overwhelmingly revealed many important molecular mechanisms underlying the control of various biological events, including floral induction in plants. The major genetic pathways of flowering have been characterized in-depth, and include the photoperiod, vernalization, autonomous and gibberellin pathways. In recent years, novel flowering pathways are increasingly being identified. These include age, thermosensory, sugar, stress and hormonal signals to control floral transition. Among them, hormonal control of flowering except the gibberellin pathway is not formally considered a major flowering pathway per se, due to relatively weak and often pleiotropic genetic effects, complex phenotypic variations, including some controversial ones. However, a number of recent studies have suggested that various stress signals may be mediated by hormonal regulation of flowering. In view of molecular diversity in plant kingdoms, this review begins with an assessment of photoperiodic flowering, not in A. thaliana, but in rice (Oryza sativa); rice is a staple crop for human consumption worldwide, and is a model system of short-day plants, cereals and breeding crops. The rice flowering pathway is then compared with that of A. thaliana. This review then aims to update our knowledge on hormonal control of flowering, and integrate it into the entire flowering gene network.
