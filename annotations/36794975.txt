East Asian Passiflora virus (EAPV) seriously affects passionfruit production in Taiwan and Vietnam. In this study, an infectious clone of EAPV Taiwan strain (EAPV-TW) was constructed, and EAPV-TWnss with an nss-tag attached to its helper component-protease (HC-Pro) was generated for monitoring the virus. Four conserved motifs of EAPV-TW HC-Pro were manipulated to create single mutations of F<sub>8</sub>I (simplified as I<sub>8</sub>), R<sub>181</sub>I (I<sub>181</sub>), F<sub>206</sub>L (L<sub>206</sub>), and E<sub>397</sub>N (N<sub>397</sub>); and double mutations of I<sub>8</sub>I<sub>181</sub>, I<sub>8</sub>L<sub>206</sub>, I<sub>8</sub>N<sub>397</sub>, I<sub>181</sub>L<sub>206</sub>, I<sub>181</sub>N<sub>397</sub>, and L<sub>206</sub>N<sub>397</sub>. Four mutants EAPV-I<sub>8</sub>I<sub>181</sub>, I<sub>8</sub>N<sub>397</sub>, I<sub>181</sub>L<sub>206</sub>, and I<sub>181</sub>N<sub>397</sub> infected <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and yellow passionfruit plants without conspicuous symptoms. Mutants EAPV-I<sub>181</sub>N<sub>397</sub> and I<sub>8</sub>N<sub>397</sub> were stable after six passages in yellow passionfruit plants and expressed a zigzag pattern of accumulation dynamic, typical of beneficial protective viruses. Agroinfiltration assay indicated that the RNA-silencing- suppression capabilities of the four double mutated HC-Pros are significantly reduced. Mutant EAPV-I<sub>181</sub>N<sub>397</sub> accumulated the highest level of siRNA at ten days post-inoculation (dpi) in <i>N. benthamiana</i> plants, then dropped to background levels after 15 dpi. In both <i>N. benthamiana</i> and yellow passionfruit plants, EAPV-I<sub>181</sub>N<sub>397</sub> conferred complete cross protection (100%) against severe EAPV-TWnss, as defined by no severe symptoms and absence of the challenge virus checked by western blotting and RT-PCR. Mutant EAPV-I<sub>8</sub>N<sub>397</sub> provided high degrees of complete protection against EAPV-TWnss in yellow passionfruit plants (90%) but not in <i>N. benthamiana</i> plants (0%). Both mutants showed complete protection (100%) against Vietnam's severe strain EAPV-GL1 in passionfruit plants. Thus, the mutants EAPV-I<sub>181</sub>N<sub>397</sub> and I<sub>8</sub>N<sub>397</sub> have excellent potential for controlling EAPV in Taiwan and Vietnam.
