A novel technique for determining the cis-/trans-stereochemistry of jasmonoyl-isoleucine by coupling its alcoholic derivatives by sodium borohydride with high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is described. Resolving cis- and trans-stereochemistry of the jasmonates in Achyranthes plants exposed to airborne (exogenous) trans-d(2)MeJA was demonstrated as an example. This novel application firmly establishes for the first time that trans-d(2)MeJA is converted exclusively into trans-JA-Ile in Achyranthes leaves, whereas the subsequent de novo biosynthesized JA-Ile possesses cis-stereochemistry. The method is simple, reproducible and could be employed for in vivo cis-/trans-stereochemistry analysis of jasmonates in plants.
