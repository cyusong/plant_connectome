Different patterns of lignified cell walls are associated with diverse functions in a variety of plant tissues. These functions rely on the stiffness and hydrophobicity that lignin polymers impart to the cell wall. The precise pattern of subcellular lignin deposition is critical for the structure-function relationship in each lignified cell type. Here, we describe the role of xylem vessels as water pipes, Casparian strips as apoplastic barriers, and the role of asymmetrically lignified endocarp b cells in exploding seed pods. We highlight similarities and differences in the genetic mechanisms underpinning local lignin deposition in these diverse cell types. By bringing together examples from different developmental contexts and different plant species, we propose that comparative approaches can benefit our understanding of lignin patterning mechanisms.
