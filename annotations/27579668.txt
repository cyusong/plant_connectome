In plants, potassium (K<sup>+</sup> ) homeostasis is tightly regulated and established against a concentration gradient to the environment. Despite the identification of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -regulated kinases as modulators of K<sup>+</sup> channels, the immediate signaling and adaptation mechanisms of plants to low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions are only partially understood. To assess the occurrence and role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in Arabidopsis thaliana roots, we employed ratiometric analyses of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in plants expressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter YC3.6 in combination with patch-clamp analyses of root cells and two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) analyses in Xenopus laevis oocytes. K<sup>+</sup> deficiency triggers two successive and distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in roots exhibiting spatial and temporal specificity. A transient primary Ca<sup>2+</sup> signature arose within 1 min in the postmeristematic stelar tissue of the elongation zone, while a secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> response occurred after several hours as sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in defined tissues of the elongation and root hair differentiation zones. Patch-clamp and TEVC analyses revealed Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of the activation of the K<sup>+</sup> channel AKT1 by the CBL1-CIPK23 Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor-kinase complex. Together, these findings identify a critical role of cell group-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in low K<sup>+</sup> responses and indicate an essential and direct role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals for AKT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel activation in roots.
