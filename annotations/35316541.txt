In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the floret development stage is an important step in determining grain yield per spike; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying floret development remain unclear. In this study, we elucidated the role of TaF-box2, a member of the F-box-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligases, which is involved in floret development and anthesis of wheat. TaF-box2 was transiently expressed in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of both tobacco and wheat. We also found that the SCF<sup>F-box2</sup> (Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1-TaF-box2) ubiquitin ligase complex mediated self-ubiquitination activity. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively overexpressed TaF-box2 showed markedly greater hypocotyl and root length than wild-type plants, and produced early flowering phenotypes. Flowering-related genes were significantly upregulated in TaF-box2-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants. Further protein interaction analyses such as yeast two-hybrid, in vitro pull-down, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed that TaF-box2 physically interacted with TaCYCL1 (Triticum aestivum cyclin-L1-1). Ubiquitination and degradation assays demonstrated that TaCYCL1 was ubiquitinated by SCF<sup>F-box2</sup> and degraded through the 26S proteasome complex. The physiological functions of the TaF-box2 protein remain unclear; however, we discuss several potential routes of involvement in various physiological mechanisms which counteract flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.
