Leaf senescence is not a chaotic breakdown but a dynamic process following a precise timetable. It enables plants to economize with their resources and control their own viability and integrity. The onset as well as the progression of leaf senescence are co-ordinated by a complex genetic network that continuously integrates developmental and environmental signals such as biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, studying senescence requires an integrative and multi-scale analysis of the dynamic changes occurring in plant physiology and metabolism. In addition to providing an automated and standardized method to quantify leaf senescence at the macroscopic scale, we also propose an analytic framework to investigate senescence at physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels throughout the plant life cycle. We have developed protocols and suggested methods for studying different key processes involved in senescence, including photosynthetic capacities, membrane degradation, redox status, and genetic regulation. All methods presented in this review were conducted on Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia-0 and results are compared with senescence-related mutants. This guideline includes experimental design, protocols, recommendations, and the automated tools for leaf senescence analyses that could also be applied to other species.
