RNA trafficking plays pivotal roles in regulating plant development, gene silencing, and adaptation to environmental stress. Satellite RNAs (satRNAs), parasites of viruses, depend on their helper viruses (HVs) for replication, encapsidation, and efficient spread. However, it remains largely unknown how satRNAs interact with viruses and the cellular machinery to undergo trafficking. Here, we show that the P20 protein of Bamboo mosaic potexvirus satRNA (satBaMV) can functionally complement in trans the systemic trafficking of P20-defective satBaMV in infected Nicotiana benthamiana The transgene-derived satBaMV, uncoupled from HV replication, was able to move autonomously across a graft union identified by RT-qPCR, RNA gel blot, and in situ RT-PCR analyses. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the major nucleolar protein fibrillarin is coprecipitated in the P20 protein complex. Notably, silencing fibrillarin suppressed satBaMV-, but not HV-, phloem-based movement following grafting or coinoculation with HV Confocal microscopy revealed that the P20 protein colocalized with fibrillarin in the nucleoli and formed punctate structures associated with plasmodesmata. The mobile satBaMV RNA appears to exist as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex composed of P20 and fibrillarin, whereas BaMV movement proteins, capsid protein, and BaMV RNA are recruited with HV coinfection. Taken together, our findings provide insight into movement of satBaMV via the fibrillarin-satBaMV-P20 RNP complex in phloem-mediated systemic trafficking.
