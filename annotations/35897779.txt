Anthocyanins accumulate in various organs of rice, and the regulatory genes involved in pigmentation of specific organs, such as pericarp, hull, leaf, apiculus, and stigma have been elucidated. However, the corresponding gene for rice culm pigmentation has not been clarified. The well-known MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complex plays vital role in regulating the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in plants. However, the core members of MBW and the hierarchical regulation between these members are not fully elucidated in rice. Here, by map-based cloning, we identified the culm-specific pigmentation gene <i>S1</i> whose alleles are also known for hull/pericarp pigmentation. We also clarified that one WD40 protein encoding gene, <i>WA1</i>, is indispensable for anthocyanin biosynthesis in rice. In the cascading regulation among MBW members, <i>S1</i> (bHLH) acts as the master gene by activating the expression of <i>C1</i> (MYB), and then C1 activates the expression of <i>WA1</i> (WD40), which is unique in plant species. This enables MBW members to be coordinated in a common way to efficiently regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Based on these studies, we explored the minimal gene set required for anthocyanin biosynthesis in rice. These findings will help us design new rice varieties with anthocyanin accumulation in specific organs as needed.

S1: !activates! C1
C1: !activates! WA1
WA1: !regulates! anthocyanin biosynthesis
