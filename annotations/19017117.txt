Regulation of iron uptake and use is critical for plant survival and growth. We isolated an MYB gene from Malus xiaojinensis named MxMYB1, which is induced under Fe-deficient conditions. Expression of MxMYB1 was upregulated by Fe starvation in the roots but not in leaves, suggesting that MxMYB1 might play a role in iron nutrition in roots. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing MxMYB1 exhibited lower iron content as compared with wild type plants under both Fe-normal (40 microM) and Fe-deficient conditions (Fe omitted and Ferrozine 300 microM). However, the contents of Cu, Zn and Mn were not changed in these transgenic plants. Gene chip and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that the expression of two Fe-related genes encoding an iron transporter AtIRT1 and an iron storage protein ferritin AtFER1 might be negatively regulated by MxMYB1 as the expression levels of these genes were lower in MxMYB1 expressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants as compared with wild type plants under both Fe-normal and Fe-deficient conditions. These results suggest that MxMYB1 may function as a negative regulator of iron uptake and storage in plants.
