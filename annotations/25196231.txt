Plant organelles are highly motile, with speed values of 3-7 µm/s in cells of land plants and about 20-60 µm/s in characean algal cells. This movement is believed to be important for rapid distribution of materials around the cell, for the plant's ability to respond to environmental biotic and abiotic signals and for proper growth. The main machinery that propels motility of organelles within plant cells is based on the actin cytoskeleton and its motor proteins the myosins. Most plants express multiple members of two main classes: myosin VIII and myosin XI. While myosin VIII has been characterized as a slow motor protein, myosins from class XI were found to be the fastest motor proteins known in all kingdoms. Paradoxically, while it was found that myosins from class XI regulate most organelle movement, it is not quite clear how or even if these motor proteins attach to the organelles whose movement they regulate.

Myosin VIII: !propels! Organelle movement 
Myosin XI: !regulates! Organelle movement 
Myosin VIII: !is a slow motor protein! 
Myosin XI: !is the fastest motor protein! 
Myosin XI: !attaches to! Organelles
