Potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Désirée) plants with an antisense reduction in the P-protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) were used to study the interaction between respiration and photorespiration. Mitochondria isolated from transgenic plants had a decreased capacity for glycine oxidation and glycine accumulated in the leaves. Malate consumption increased in leaves of GDC deficient plants and the capacity for malate and NADH oxidation increased in isolated mitochondria. A lower level of alternative oxidase protein and decreased partitioning of electrons to the alternative pathway was found in these plants. The adenylate status was altered in protoplasts from transgenic plants, most notably the chloroplastic ATP/ADP ratio increased. The lower capacity for photorespiration in leaves of GDC deficient plants was compensated for by increased respiratory decarboxylations in the light. This is interpreted as a decreased light suppression of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in GDC deficient plants in comparison to wild-type plants. The results support the view that respiratory decarboxylations in the light are restricted at the level of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and/or isocitrate dehydrogenase and that this effect is likely to be mediated by mitochondrial photorespiratory products.
