['25425527', 'Growing conditions combining high light intensities and low temperatures lead to  anthocyanin accumulation in plants. This response was contrasted between two  Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, which were used to decipher the genetic and  molecular bases underlying the variation of this response. Quantitative trait  loci (QTLs) for flowering time (FT) and anthocyanin accumulation under a  high-light and low-temperature scenario versus a control environment were mapped.  Major QTLs were confirmed using near-isogenic lines. Candidate genes were  examined using mutants and gene expression studies as well as transgenic  complementation. Several QTLs were found for FT and for anthocyanin content, of  which one QTL co-located at the ENHANCER OF AG-4 2 (HUA2) locus. That HUA2 is a  regulator of both pathways was confirmed by the analysis of loss-of-function  mutants. For a strong expression of anthocyanin, additional allelic variation was  detected for the PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1 (PAP1) and PAP2 genes which  control the anthocyanin pathway. The genetic control of variation for anthocyanin  content was dissected in A. thaliana and shown to be affected by a common  regulator of flowering and anthocyanin biosynthesis together with  anthocyanin-specific regulators.', '2015 Apr', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13177', 'Reymond']
