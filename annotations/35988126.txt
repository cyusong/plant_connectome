The efficiency of suberized plant/environment interfaces as transpiration barriers is not established by the suberin polymer but by the wax molecules sorbed to the suberin polymer. Suberized cell walls formed as barriers at the plant/soil or plant/atmosphere interface in various plant organs (soil-grown roots, aerial roots, tubers, and bark) were enzymatically isolated from five different plant species (Clivia miniata, Monstera deliciosa, Solanum tuberosum, Manihot esculenta, and Malus domestica). Anatomy, chemical composition and efficiency as transpiration barriers (water loss in m s<sup>-1</sup>) of the different suberized cell wall samples were quantified. Results clearly indicated that there was no correlation between barrier properties of the suberized interfaces and the number of suberized cell layers, the amount of soluble wax and the amounts of suberin. Suberized interfaces of C. miniata roots, M. esculenta roots, and M. domestica bark periderms formed poor or hardly any transpiration barrier. Permeances varying between 1.1 and 5.1 × 10<sup>-8</sup> m s<sup>-1</sup> were very close to the permeance of water (7.4 × 10<sup>-8</sup> m s<sup>-1</sup>) evaporating from a water/atmosphere interface. Suberized interfaces of aerial roots of M. deliciosa and tubers of S. tuberosum formed reasonable transpiration barriers with permeances varying between 7.4 × 10<sup>-10</sup> and 4.2 × 10<sup>-9</sup> m s<sup>-1</sup>, which were similar to the upper range of permeances measured with isolated cuticles (about 10<sup>-9</sup> m s<sup>-1</sup>). Upon wax extraction, permeances of M. deliciosa and S. tuberosum increased nearly tenfold, which proves the importance of wax establishing a transpiration barrier. Finally, highly opposite results obtained with M. esculenta and S. tuberosum periderms are discussed in relation to their agronomical importance for postharvest losses and tuber storage.
