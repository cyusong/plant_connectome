The phytohormones auxin and cytokinin are key regulators of plant development, and both regulate almost all aspects of plant growth and development. Communication between auxin-cytokinin signaling pathways has been the subject of intense research. However, few studies have focused specifically on the development of the early gynoecium. We have recently discovered that cytokinin signaling plays a role in the regulation of auxin biosynthesis and transport in the ovary region of the gynoecium, and that the transcription factor SPATULA (SPT) is necessary. Here, we provide evidence that indicates that cytokinin and auxin have a synergistic relationship at the medial domain during gynoecium development, and that SPT is important for this interaction.

cytokinin: !regulates! auxin biosynthesis and transport
auxin: !regulates! plant growth and development
cytokinin: !synergizes with! auxin
SPT: !regulates! cytokinin-auxin interaction
SPT: !is necessary for! cytokinin-auxin interaction
