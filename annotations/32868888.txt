Diel and seasonal oscillations are two major environmental changes in nature. While organisms cope with the former by the well-characterized mechanism of the circadian clock<sup>1,2</sup>, there is limited information on the molecular mechanisms underlying long-term responses to the latter<sup>3-5</sup>. Histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a repressive histone modification, imparts stability and plasticity to gene regulation during developmental transitions<sup>6-9</sup>. Here we studied the seasonal and diel dynamics of H3K27me3 at the genome-wide level in a natural population of perennial Arabidopsis halleri and compared these dynamics with those of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), an active histone modification. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that H3K27me3 exhibits seasonal plasticity and diel stability. Furthermore, we found that the seasonal H3K27me3 oscillation is delayed in phase relative to the H3K4me3 oscillation, particularly for genes associated with environmental memory. Our findings suggest that H3K27me3 monitors past transcriptional activity to create long-term gene expression trends during organismal responses over weeks in natural fluctuating environments.
