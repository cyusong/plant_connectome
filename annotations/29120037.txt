The seeds of most heterotrophic plants, commonly referred to as dust seeds, are typically dispersed in the air like dust particles. Therefore, little attention has been paid to how seeds of heterotrophic plants are dispersed, owing to the notion that wind dispersal is the dominant strategy. However, inconspicuous but fleshy, indehiscent fruit can be observed in distantly related plants that have independently evolved full heterotrophy. Here I investigated the seed dispersal system in three unrelated fully heterotrophic plants with fleshy, indehiscent fruits (Yoania amagiensis, Monotropastrum humile and Phacellanthus tubiflorus) by direct observation, a differential exclusion experiment of fruit feeders and investigation on seed viability through the digestive tract. The present study revealed that camel crickets are the major seed disperser in three achlorophyllous plants in the study population. This represents the first evidence of seed dispersal by camel crickets in any angiosperm species. These heterotrophic plants grow in the understorey of densely vegetated forests where wind is probably an ineffective seed dispersal agent. Life-history traits of the achlorophyllous plants associated with heterotrophic lifestyles, such as colonization of dark understorey habitats and dust seeds, could facilitate independent recruitment of the novel endozoochorous seed dispersal system by camel crickets.
