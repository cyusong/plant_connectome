Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is a potent promoter of plant senescence. ORESARA3 (ORE3)/ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2), a protein similar to the members of the disease-related Nramp metal transporter family, is involved in cross-talk among several senescence processes related to abscisic acid, ethylene, MeJA, age and darkness. Nevertheless, the mechanism involved in the regulation of ORE3/EIN2 in exogenous MeJA-induced leaf senescence remains unclear. The C-terminal end of ORE3/EIN2 (CEND) was cleaved from ORE3/EIN2 located in the endoplasmic reticulum and then transferred to the nucleus during MeJA-induced senescence. Further analyses showed that mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MPK6) promoted CEND cleavage and nuclear translocation. Nuclear CEND accumulated ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), a transcription factor that accelerates MeJA-induced leaf senescence wherein ORESARA9 (ORE9) expression was suppressed in ein3, ore3, and mpk6 mutant plants. ChIP experiments revealed that EIN3 bound directly to the ORE9 promoter and this binding was enhanced in MeJA-induced leaf senescence. This study revealed the effect of the signalling pathway involving MPK6-ORE3-EIN3-ORE9 on regulating leaf senescence and provided insights into the mechanism of MeJA in promoting leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana.
