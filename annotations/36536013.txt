Photorespiration is an essential process juxtaposed between plant carbon and nitrogen metabolism that responds to dynamic environments. Photorespiration recycles inhibitory intermediates arising from oxygenation reactions catalysed by Rubisco back into the C<sub>3</sub> cycle, but it is unclear what proportions of its nitrogen-containing intermediates (glycine and serine) are exported into other metabolisms in vivo and how these pool sizes affect net CO<sub>2</sub> gas exchange during photorespiratory transients. Here, to address this uncertainty, we measured rates of amino acid export from photorespiration using isotopically non-stationary metabolic flux analysis. This analysis revealed that ~23-41% of the photorespiratory carbon was exported from the pathway as serine under various photorespiratory conditions. Furthermore, we determined that the build-up and relaxation of glycine pools constrained a large portion of photosynthetic acclimation during photorespiratory transients. These results reveal the unique and important roles of glycine and serine in successfully maintaining various photorespiratory fluxes that occur under environmental fluctuations in nature and providing carbon and nitrogen for metabolism.
