Plants are regularly challenged by unfavorable environmental conditions. As climate change continues, adverse situations such as drought, heat, and cold are expected to increase and become more severe. Most starchy crops are affected by such stresses. In recent years, researchers have made many new discoveries about starch metabolism in general and also on granule structure, including effects on starch following longer-term temperature stresses. However, in this study, we focus on short-term temperature stress on storage starch granule properties. Here our knowledge is less and it is likely that also short-term temperature stresses can affect various starch parameters. Therefore, we see a need for this type of analysis and discuss the matter in more detail and we conclude that a deeper knowledge particularly of starch granule parameters could allow targeted breeding of cultivars that exhibit different starch characteristics as a result of short-term stress. For these reasons, we are convinced that more comprehensive research on the effects of short-term temperature stress on starch granule characteristics is important, necessary, and timely.
