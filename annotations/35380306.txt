Tuber-omics in potato with the T- and D-types of cytoplasm showed different sets of differentially expressed genes and proteins in response to cold storage. For the first time, we report differences in gene and protein expression in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers possessing the T- or D-type cytoplasm. Two F1 diploid reciprocal populations, referred to as T and D, were used. The pooling strategy was applied for detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in tubers consisting of extreme chip colour after cold storage. RNA and protein bulks were constructed from contrasting phenotypes. We recognized 48 and 15 DEGs for the T and D progenies, respectively. DEPs were identified in the amyloplast and mitochondrial fractions. In the T-type cytoplasm, only 2 amyloplast-associated and 5 mitochondria-associated DEPs were detected. Of 37 mitochondria-associated DEPs in the D-type cytoplasm, there were 36 downregulated DEPs in the dark chip colour bulks. These findings suggest that T- and D-type of cytoplasm might influence sugar accumulation in cold-stored potato tubers in different ways. We showed that the mt/nucDNA ratio was higher in D-possessing tubers after cold storage than in T progeny. For the D-type cytoplasm, the pt/nucDNA ratio was higher for tubers characterized by dark chip colour than for those with light chip colour. Our findings suggest that T- and D-type cytoplasm might influence sugar accumulation in cold-stored potato tubers in different ways.
