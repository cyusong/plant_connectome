Auxin is a crucial plant growth regulator. Forward genetic screens for auxin-related mutants have led to the identification of key genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling. Loss-of-function mutations in genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis, a metabolically related route that produces defense compounds, result in auxin overproduction. We identified an allelic series of fertile, hypomorphic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants for the essential glucosinolate biosynthetic gene <i>ROOTY</i> (<i>RTY</i>) that exhibit a range of phenotypic defects characteristic of enhanced auxin production. Genetic characterization of these lines uncovered phenotypic suppression by <i>cyp79b2 cyp79b3</i>, <i>wei2</i>, and <i>wei7</i> mutations and revealed the phenomenon of interallelic complementation in several <i>RTY</i> transheterozygotes. Structural modeling of RTY elucidated the relationships between structure and function in the RTY homo- and heterodimers, and unveiled the likely structural basis of interallelic complementation. This work underscores the importance of employing true null mutants in genetic complementation studies.
