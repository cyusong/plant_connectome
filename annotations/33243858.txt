Zellweger <i>et al</i> (Reports, 15 May 2020, p. 772) claimed that forest plant communities' response to global warming is primarily controlled by microclimate dynamics. We show that community thermophilization is poorly explained by the underlying components of microclimate, and that global warming primarily controls the climatic lag of plant communities. Deconstructing the underlying components of microclimate provides insights for managers.

Global warming: !controls! climatic lag of plant communities
microclimate dynamics: !poorly explains! thermophilization of plant communities
