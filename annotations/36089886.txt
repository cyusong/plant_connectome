The phloem is a highly specialized vascular tissue that forms a fundamentally important transport and signaling pathway in plants. It is therefore a system worth protecting. The main function of the phloem is to transport the products of photosynthesis throughout the whole plant, but it also transports soluble signaling molecules and propagates electrophysiological signals. The phloem is constantly threatened by mechanical injuries, phloem-sucking pests and parasites, and the spread of pathogens, which has led to the evolution of efficient defense mechanisms. One such mechanism involves structural phloem proteins, which are thought to facilitate sieve element occlusion following injury and to defend the plant against pathogens. In leguminous plants, specialized structural phloem proteins known as forisomes form unique mechanoproteins via sophisticated molecular interaction and assembly mechanisms, thus enabling reversible sieve element occlusion. By understanding the structure and function of forisomes and other structural phloem proteins, we can develop a toolbox for biotechnological applications in material science and medicine. Furthermore, understanding the involvement of structural phloem proteins in plant defense mechanisms will allow phloem engineering as a new strategy for the development of crop varieties that are resistant to pests, pathogens and parasites.
