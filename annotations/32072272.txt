Volatile emissions were detected for the first time in male flowers of the early-branching angiosperm Amborella trichopoda, suggesting a defensive and attractive double role of these compounds. Flower volatile emissions were detected for the first time in male flowers of the early-branching angiosperm Amborella trichopoda. A mixture of seven volatile compounds is found in flower buds, with limonene resulting as the most abundant compound (67%). Further five volatiles are found in freshly opened flowers, with limonene contributing to 31.7%, followed by decanal (15.5%) and by ethyl octanoate (10.3%). While monoterpene hydrocarbons dominate in flower buds (73.6%), their emission in freshly opened flowers is reduced to 41.1%, while non-terpene derivatives are the most abundant (47.1%) chemical class. These compounds, emitted in low amounts, are possibly linked to pollen, which is considered the only reward offered for insect-pollination in this species.
