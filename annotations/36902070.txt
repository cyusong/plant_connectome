Salinity stress is a serious limitation to tomato growth and development. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Sly-miR164a on tomato growth and fruit nutritional quality under salt stress. The results showed that the root length, fresh weight, plant height, stem diameter and ABA content of miR164a#STTM (knockdown of Sly-miR164a) lines were higher than those of WT and miR164a#OE (overexpression of Sly-miR164a) lines under salt stress. Compared with WT, miR164a#STTM tomato lines exhibited lower ROS accumulation under salt stress. In addition, the fruits of miR164a#STTM tomato lines had higher soluble solids, lycopene, ascorbic acid (ASA) and carotenoid content compared with WT. The study indicated that tomato plants were more sensitive to salt when Sly-miR164a was overexpressed, while knockdown of Sly-miR164a enhanced plant salt tolerance and improved fruit nutritional value.
