During plant-pathogenic fungi and host plants interactions, numerous pathogen-derived proteins are secreted resulting in the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. For efficient trafficking of secretory proteins, including those important in disease progression, the cytoplasmic coat protein complex II (COPII) exhibits a multifunctional role whose elucidation remains limited. Here, we discovered that the COPII cargo receptor MoErv29 functions as a target of MoHac1, a previously identified transcription factor of the UPR pathway. In Magnaporthe oryzae, deletion of MoERV29 severely affected the vegetative growth, conidiation and biotrophic invasion of the fungus in susceptible rice hosts. We demonstrated that MoErv29 is required for the delivery of secreted proteins through recognition and binding of the amino-terminal tripeptide motifs following the signal peptide. By using bioinformatics analysis, we predicted a cargo spectrum of MoErv29 and found that MoErv29 is required for the secretion of many proteins, including extracellular laccases and apoplastic effectors. This secretion is mediated through the conventional endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi secretion pathway and is important for conferring host recognition and disease resistance. Taken together, our results revealed how MoErv29 operates on effector secretion, and our findings provided a critical link between COPII vesicle trafficking and the UPR pathway.
