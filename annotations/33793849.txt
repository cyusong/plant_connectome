A deficiency of the essential macronutrient sulfur leads to stunted plant growth and yield loss; however, an association with a symbiotic fungus can greatly improve nutrient uptake by the host plant. Here, we identified and functionally characterized a high-affinity sulfate transporter from the endophytic fungus Serendipita indica. SiSulT fulfills all the criteria expected of a functional sulfate transporter responding to sulfur limitation: SiSulT expression was induced when S. indica was grown under low-sulfate conditions, and heterologous expression of SiSulT complemented a yeast mutant lacking sulfate transport. We generated a knockdown strain of SiSulT by RNA interference to investigate the consequences of the partial loss of this transporter for the fungus and the host plant (maize, Zea mays) during colonization. Wild-type (WT) S. indica, but not the knockdown strain (kd-SiSulT), largely compensated for low-sulfate availability and supported plant growth. Colonization by WT S. indica also allowed maize roots to allocate precious resources away from sulfate assimilation under low-sulfur conditions, as evidenced by the reduction in expression of most sulfate assimilation genes. Our study illustrates the utility of the endophyte S. indica in sulfur nutrition research and offers potential avenues for agronomically sound amelioration of plant growth in low-sulfate environments.
