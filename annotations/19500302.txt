['19500302', 'The spindle is essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis, but the  molecular mechanism of meiotic spindle organization in higher plants is still not  well understood. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of a  plant-specific protein, MULTIPOLAR SPINDLE 1 (MPS1), which is involved in spindle  organization in meiocytes of Arabidopsis thaliana. The homozygous mps1 mutant  exhibits male and female sterility. Light microscopy showed that mps1 mutants  produced multiple uneven spores during anther development, most of which aborted  in later stages. Cytological analysis showed that chromosome segregation was  abnormal in mps1 meiocytes. Immunolocalization showed unequal bipolar or  multipolar spindles in mps1 meiocytes, which indicated that aberrant spindles  resulted in disordered chromosome segregation. MPS1 encodes a 377-amino-acid  protein with putative coiled-coil motifs. In situ hybridization analysis showed  that MPS1 is strongly expressed in meiocytes.', '2009 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03929.x', 'Yang']
