There is a large number of proteins in nature containing Tetratrico Peptide Repeats (TPRs). TPR motifs are defined as a protein-protein interaction module involved in regulation of different cellular functions. We have recently identified TTL1 as a protein containing TPR motifs required for abscisic acid responses and osmotic stress tolerance. In recent years several of these proteins have been found to be essential for responses to other hormones such ethylene, cytokinin, gibberelling and auxin in Arabidopsis. Thus, proteins containing TPRs are emerging as essential determinants for signal transduction pathways mediated by most plant hormones.
