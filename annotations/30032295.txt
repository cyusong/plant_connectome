The synthesis of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) determines adequate amounts of metabolites for the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway. Glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of ALA synthesis and was previously considered to be exclusively localized in the chloroplast stroma of light-exposed plants. To assess the intraplastidic localization of GluTR, we developed a fast separation protocol of soluble and membrane-bound proteins and reassessed the subplastidal allocation of GluTR in stroma and membrane fractions of Arabidopsis plants grown under different light regimes as well as during de-etiolation and dark incubations. Under the examined conditions, the amount of stroma-localized GluTR correlated with the ALA synthesis rate. The transfer to dark repression of ALA synthesis resulted in a loss of soluble GluTR. Arabidopsis mutants lacking one of the GluTR-interacting factors FLUORESCENT (FLU), the GluTR-binding protein (GBP) or ClpC, a chaperone of the Clp protease system, were applied to examine the amount of GluTR and its distribution to the stroma or membrane in darkness and light. Taking into consideration the different compartmental allocation of GluTR, its stability and ALA synthesis rates, the post-translational impact of these regulatory factors on GluTR activity and plastidic sublocalization is discussed.
