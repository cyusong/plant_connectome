Starch is one of the main utilization products of sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> L.), the fifth largest cereal crop in the world. Up to now, the regulation mechanism of starch biosynthesis is rarely documented in sorghum. In the present study, we identified 30 genes encoding the C2-C2 zinc finger domain (DOF), with one to three exons in the sorghum genome. The DOF proteins of sorghum were divided into two types according to the results of sequence alignment and evolutionary analysis. Based on gene expressions and co-expression analysis, we identified a regulatory factor, <i>SbDof21</i>, that was located on chromosome 5. <i>SbDof21</i> contained two exons, encoding a 36.122 kD protein composed of 340 amino acids. <i>SbDof21</i> co-expressed with 15 genes involved in the sorghum starch biosynthesis pathway, and the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) with 11 genes were greater than 0.9. The results of qRT-PCR assays indicated that <i>SbDof21</i> is highly expressed in sorghum grains, exhibiting low relative expression levels in the tissues of roots, stems and leaves. SbDOF21 presented as a typical DOF transcription factor (TF) that was localized to the nucleus and possessed transcriptional activation activity. Amino acids at positions 182-231 of SbDOF21 formed an important structure in its activation domain. The results of EMSA showed that SbDOF21 could bind to four tandem repeats of P-Box (TGTAAAG) motifs in vitro, such as its homologous proteins of ZmDOF36, OsPBF and TaPBF. Meanwhile, we also discovered that SbDOF21 could bind and transactivate <i>SbGBSSI</i>, a key gene in sorghum amylose biosynthesis. Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that SbDOF21 acts as an important regulator in sorghum starch biosynthesis, exhibiting potential values for the improvement of starch contents in sorghum.
