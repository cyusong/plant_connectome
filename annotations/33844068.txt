New transgenic and biotechnological approaches may serve as a key component in achieving crop resistance to root parasitic weeds. Root parasitic weeds inflict severe damage to numerous crops, reducing yield quantity and quality. A lack of new sources of resistance limits our ability to manage newly developing, more virulent races. Having no effective means to control the parasites in most crops, innovative biotechnological solutions are needed. Several novel biotechnological strategies using regulatory RNA molecules, the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and T-DNA insertions have been acknowledged for engineering resistance against parasitic weeds. Significant breakthroughs have been made over the years in deciphering the plant genome and its functions, including the genomes of parasitic weeds. However, the basis of biotechnological strategies to generate host resistance to root parasitic weeds needs to be further developed. Gene-silencing and editing tools should be used to target key processes of host-parasite interactions, such as strigolactone biosynthesis and signaling, haustorium development, and degradation and penetration of the host cell wall. In this review, we summarize and discuss the main areas of research leading to the discovery and functional analysis of genes involved in host-induced gene silencing that target key parasite genes, transgenic host modification, and host gene editing to generate sustainable resistance to root parasitic weeds.
