Alkaline stress is a major form of abiotic stress that severely inhibits plant growth and development, thus restricting crop productivity. However, little is known about how plants respond to alkali. In this study, a slow-type anion channel homolog 3 gene, GsSLAH3, was isolated and functionally characterized. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the GsSLAH3 protein contains 10 transmembrane helices. Consistently, GsSLAH3 was found to locate on plasma membrane by transient expression in onion epidermal cells. In wild soybeans, GsSLAH3 expression was induced by NaHCO<sub>3</sub> treatment, suggesting its involvement in plant response to alkaline stress. Ectopic expression of GsSLAH3 in yeast increased sensitivity to alkali treatment. Dramatically, overexpression of GsSLAH3 in Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced alkaline tolerance during the germination, seedling and adult stages. More interestingly, we found that transgenic lines also improved plant tolerance to KHCO<sub>3</sub> rather than high pH treatment. A nitrate content analysis of Arabidopsis shoots showed that GsSLAH3 overexpressing lines accumulated more NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> than wild-type. In summary, our data suggest that GsSLAH3 is a positive alkali responsive gene that increases bicarbonate resistance specifically.
