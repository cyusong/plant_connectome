Genetic and environmental factors affect bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant architecture, which determines grain yield. In this study, we demonstrate that miR156 controls bread wheat plant architecture. We show that overexpression of tae-miR156 in bread wheat cultivar Kenong199 leads to increased tiller number and severe defects in spikelet formation, probably due to the tae-miR156-mediated repression of a group of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE</i> (<i>SPL</i>) genes. Furthermore, we found that the expression of two genes <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i> (<i>TaTB1</i>) and <i>BARREN STALK1</i> (<i>TaBA1</i>), whose orthologous genes in diverse plant species play conserved roles in regulating plant architecture, is markedly reduced in the tae-miR156-OE bread wheat plants. Significantly, we demonstrate that the strigolactone (SL) signaling repressor DWARF53 (TaD53), which physically associates with the transcriptional corepressor TOPLESS, can directly interact with the N-terminal domains of miR156-controlled TaSPL3/17. Most importantly, TaSPL3/17-mediated transcriptional activation of <i>TaBA1</i> and <i>TaTB1</i> can be largely repressed by TaD53 in the transient expression system. Our results reveal potential association between miR156-TaSPLs and SL signaling pathways during bread wheat tillering and spikelet development.
