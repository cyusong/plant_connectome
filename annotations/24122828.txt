['24122828', 'Members of the Arabidopsis thaliana phosphate transporter1 (PHT1) family are key  players in acquisition of Pi from the rhizosphere, and their regulation is  indispensable for the maintenance of cellular Pi homeostasis. Here, we reveal  posttranslational regulation of Pi transport through modulation of degradation of  PHT1 proteins by the RING-type ubiquitin E3 ligase, nitrogen limitation  adaptation (NLA). Loss of function of NLA caused high Pi accumulation resulting  from increases in the levels of several PHT1s at the protein rather than the  transcript level. Evidence of decreased endocytosis and ubiquitination of PHT1s  in nla mutants and interaction between NLA and PHT1s in the plasma membranes  suggests that NLA directs the ubiquitination of plasma membrane-localized PHT1s,  which triggers clathrin-dependent endocytosis followed by endosomal sorting to  vacuoles. Furthermore, different subcellular localization of NLA and phosphate2  (pho2; a ubiquitin E2 conjugase) and the synergistic effect of the accumulation  of PHT1s and Pi in nla pho2 mutants suggest that they function independently but  cooperatively to regulate PHT1 protein amounts. Intriguingly, NLA and PHO2 are  the targets of two Pi starvation-induced microRNAs, miR827 and miR399,  respectively. Therefore, our findings uncover modulation of Pi transport activity  in response to Pi availability through the integration of a microRNA-mediated  posttranscriptional pathway and a ubiquitin-mediated posttranslational regulatory  pathway.', '2013 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.113.116012', 'Chiou']
