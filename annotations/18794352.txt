['18794352', 'Viruses induce pathogenic symptoms on plants but the molecular basis is poorly  understood. Here, we show that transgenic Arabidopsis expressing the pathogenesis  protein betaC1 of Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV), a geminivirus,  can phenocopy to a large extent disease symptoms of virus-infected tobacco plants  in having upward curled leaves, radialized leaves with outgrowth tissues from  abaxial surfaces, and sterile flowers. These morphological changes are paralleled  by a reduction in miR165/166 levels and an increase in PHB and PHV transcript  levels. Two factors, ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 (AS1) and ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2), are  known to regulate leaf development as AS1/AS2 complex. Strikingly, betaC1 plants  phenocopy plants overexpressing AS2 at the morphological and molecular level and  betaC1 is able to partially complement as2 mutation. betaC1 binds directly to  AS1, elicits morphological and gene expression changes dependent on AS1 but not  AS2, and attenuates expression of selective jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene.  Our results show that betaC1 forms a complex with AS1 to execute its pathogenic  functions and to suppress a subset of JA responses.', '2008 Sep 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1682208', 'Chua']
