Gravity perception and gravitropic response are essential for plant development. In herbaceous species, it is widely accepted that one of the primary events in gravity perception involves the displacement of amyloplasts within specialized cells. However, the early signaling events leading to stem reorientation are not fully known, especially in woody species in which primary and secondary growth occur. Thirty-six percent of the identified proteins that were differentially expressed after gravistimulation were established as potential Thioredoxin targets. In addition, Thioredoxin h expression was induced following gravistimulation. In situ immunolocalization indicated that Thioredoxin h protein co-localized with the amyloplasts located in the endodermal cells. These investigations suggest the involvement of Thioredoxin h in the first events of signal transduction in inclined poplar stems, leading to reaction wood formation.
