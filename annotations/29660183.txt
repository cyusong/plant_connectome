Seed vigour is a key trait essential for the production of sustainable and profitable crops. The genetic basis of variation in seed vigour has recently been determined in Brassica oleracea, but the relative importance of the interaction with parental environment is unknown. We produced seeds under a range of maternal environments, including global warming scenarios. Lines were compared that had the same genetic background, but different alleles (for high and low vigour) at the quantitative trait loci responsible for determining seed vigour by altering abscisic acid (ABA) content and sensitivity. We found a consistent effect of beneficial alleles across production environments; however, environmental stress during production also had a large impact that enhanced the genetic difference in seed performance, measured as germination speed, resistance to controlled deterioration and induction of secondary dormancy. Environmental interaction with allelic differences in key genes that determine ABA content and sensitivity develops a continuity in performance from rapid germination through to failure to complete germination, and increasing depths of seed dormancy. The genetic-environmental interaction revealed provides a robust mechanism of bet-hedging to minimize environmental risk during subsequent germination, and this could have facilitated the rapid change in seed behaviour (reduced dormancy and rapid germination) observed during crop domestication.
