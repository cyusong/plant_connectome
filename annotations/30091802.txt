Plant Ecophysiology is the study on how Plant Physiology is modulated by the environment. This discipline could have benefited greatly from the development of the different 'omic' technologies (from genomics to metabolomics). Instead, the overall impression is that ecophysiology and 'omics' have developed mostly independent each other. Here we provide a literature analysis over the past 20 years which fully confirms this view. Then, we review a few examples of studies in which ecophysiology and 'omics' studies have combined to different extents to illustrate the potential benefits from their mutualistic interaction. In addition, we debate on the possibilities of working with plants other than Arabidopsis, which is illustrated with some examples of fascinating plants from extreme environments of the world, what we call the 'sherplants'. Finally, we raise a call to both communities (ecophysiology and 'omics') to integrate these disciplines to enter an 'ecophysiolomics era' to maximize our understanding about plant mechanisms from a multidisciplinary approach.
