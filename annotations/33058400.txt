Panicle number (PN) is one of the three yield components in rice. As one of the most unstable traits, the dynamic change in tiller number (DCTN) may determine the final PN. However, the genetic basis of DCTN and its relationship with PN remain unclear. Here, 377 deeply re-sequenced rice accessions were used to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for tiller/PN. It was found that the DCTN pattern rather than maximum tiller number or effective tiller ratio is the determinant factor of high PN. The DCTN pattern that affords more panicles exhibits a period of stable tillering peak between 30 and 45 days after transplant (called DT30 and DT45, respectively), which was believed as an ideal pattern contributing to the steady transition from tiller development to panicle development (ST-TtP). Consistently, quantitative trait loci (QTL) expressed near DT30-DT45 were especially critical to the rice DCTN and in supporting the ST-TtP. The spatio-temporal expression analysis showed that the expression pattern of keeping relatively high expression in root at 24:00 (R24-P2) from about DT30 to DT45 is a typical expression pattern of cloned tiller genes, and the candidate genes with R24-P2 can facilitate the prediction of PN. Moreover, gene OsSAUR27 was identified by an integrated approach combining GWAS, bi-parental QTL mapping and transcription. These findings related to the genetic basis underlying the DCTN will provide the genetic theory in making appropriate decisions on field management, and in developing new varieties with high PN and ideal dynamic plant architecture.
