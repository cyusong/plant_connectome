To protect against water loss, land plants have developed the cuticle; however, the cuticle strongly restricts CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Controlling this trade-off relationship is an important strategy for plant survival, but the extent to which the changes in cuticle affects this relationship is not clear. To evaluate this, we measured CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate and transpiration rate together in the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutant <i>excessive transpiration1</i> (<i>extra1</i>), which exhibited marked evaporative water loss due to an increased cuticle permeability caused by a new allele of <i>ACETYL-COA CARBOXYLASE 1</i> (<i>ACC1</i>). Under high humidity (85%) conditions, the <i>extra1</i> mutant exhibited higher CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate in exchange for decreasing water use efficiency by one-third compared to the <i>slow anion channel-associated 1 (slac1</i>) mutant, whose stomata are continuously open. Our results indicate that the increased cuticle permeability in <i>extra1</i> affects transpiration rate more than CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate, but the effect on CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate is larger than the effect of open stomata in <i>slac1</i>, suggesting that the cuticle permeability is an important parameter for the trade-off relationship between drought tolerance and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake in land plants.
