Histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) is recognized as a regulatory mechanism that controls a range of cellular processes. We previously showed that H2Bub1 was involved in responses to biotic stress in Arabidopsis. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of H2Bub1 in controlling responses to abiotic stress remain limited. Here, we report that HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION1 (HUB1) and HUB2 played important regulatory roles in response to salt stress. Phenotypic analysis revealed that H2Bub1 mutants confer decreased tolerance to salt stress. Further analysis showed that H2Bub1 regulated the depolymerization of microtubules (MTs), the expression of PROTEIN TYROSINE PHOSPHATASE1 (PTP1) and MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE (MKP) genes - DsPTP1, MKP1, IBR5, PHS1, and was required for the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase3 (MAP kinase3, MPK3) and MPK6 in response to salt stress. Moreover, both tyrosine phosphorylation and the activation of MPK3 and MPK6 affected MT stability in salt stress response. Thus, the results indicate that H2Bub1 regulates salt stress-induced MT depolymerization, and the PTP-MPK3/6 signalling module is responsible for integrating signalling pathways that regulate MT stability, which is critical for plant salt stress tolerance.
