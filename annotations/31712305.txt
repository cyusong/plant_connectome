The Evening Complex (EC) is a core component of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian clock, which represses target gene expression at the end of the day and integrates temperature information to coordinate environmental and endogenous signals. Here we show that the EC induces repressive chromatin structure to regulate the evening transcriptome. The EC component ELF3 directly interacts with a protein from the SWI2/SNF2-RELATED (SWR1) complex to control deposition of H2A.Z-nucleosomes at the EC target genes. SWR1 components display circadian oscillation in gene expression with a peak at dusk. In turn, SWR1 is required for the circadian clockwork, as defects in SWR1 activity alter morning-expressed genes. The EC-SWR1 complex binds to the loci of the core clock genes <i>PSEUDO</i>-<i>RESPONSE REGULATOR7</i> (<i>PRR7</i>) and <i>PRR9</i> and catalyzes deposition of nucleosomes containing the histone variant H2A.Z coincident with the repression of these genes at dusk. This provides a mechanism by which the circadian clock temporally establishes repressive chromatin domains to shape oscillatory gene expression around dusk.
