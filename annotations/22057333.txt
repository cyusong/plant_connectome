Ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) have compact effects on plant development and stress responses. It is not well understood about the mechanism of ABA modulation in ethylene biosynthesis. In our recent research, HY5-AtERF11 regulon was evidenced to connect the ABA action and ethylene biosynthesis. In this paper, by analyzing the expression of ABA biosynthesis genes and the ABA concentration in ethylene over-production mutants, we demonstrated that ethylene production affected by HY5-AtERF11 regulon targeted gene increased the expression of ABA biosynthesis genes and its contents. In addition, we discussed that HY5 might function as a convergence point of multiple hormones in response to light.
