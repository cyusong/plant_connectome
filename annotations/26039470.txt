Epigenetic modifications of the chromatin structure are crucial for many biological processes and act on genes during the development and germination of seeds. The spatial distribution of 3 epigenetic markers, i.e. H4K5ac, H3K4me2 and H3K4me1 was investigated in 'matured,' 'dry,' 'imbibed" and 'germinating' embryos of a model grass, Brachypodium. Our results indicate that the patterns of epigenetic modification differ in the various types of tissues of embryos that were analyzed. Such a tissue-specific manner of these modifications may be linked to the switch of the gene expression profiles in various organs of the developing embryo.
