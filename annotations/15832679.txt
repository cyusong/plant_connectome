We studied the systemic effects after infection of susceptible and resistant (expressing HSR) wheat plants with leaf rust (Puccinia recondita f.sp. tritici) on the amount of hydrogen peroxide and activity of some ROS scavenging enzymes. Measurements were performed 7 and 21 days after inoculation. In susceptible cultivar (Sadovo 1), an inhibition of activity of catatase and GST was found. By contrast, in resistant cultivar (Kristal), the infection caused an activation of these enzymes. Moreover, it was established that cv. Kristal plants possess constitutive higher levels of hydrogen peroxide, as well as higher superoxide dismutase activity.

Leaf Rust: !inhibits! Catatase/GST activity 
Leaf Rust: !activates! Catatase/GST activity 
Kristal cultivar: !possesses! Higher H2O2 levels 
Kristal cultivar: !possesses! Higher SOD activity
