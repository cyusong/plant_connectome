['30938771', 'Because of their symbiotic origin, many mitochondrial proteins are well conserved  across eukaryotic kingdoms. It is however less obvious how specific lineages have  obtained novel nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Here, we report a case of  mitochondrial neofunctionalization in plants. Phylogenetic analysis of genes  containing the Domain of Unknown Function 295 (DUF295) revealed that the domain  likely originated in Angiosperms. The C-terminal DUF295 domain is usually  accompanied by an N-terminal F-box domain, involved in ubiquitin ligation via  binding with ASK1/SKP1-type proteins. Due to gene duplication, the gene family  has expanded rapidly, with 94 DUF295-related genes in Arabidopsis thaliana alone.  Two DUF295 family subgroups have uniquely evolved and quickly expanded within  Brassicaceae. One of these subgroups has completely lost the F-box, but instead  obtained strongly predicted mitochondrial targeting peptides. We show that  several representatives of this DUF295 Organellar group are effectively targeted  to plant mitochondria and chloroplasts. Furthermore, many DUF295 Organellar genes  are induced by mitochondrial dysfunction, whereas F-Box DUF295 genes are not. In  agreement, several Brassicaceae-specific DUF295 Organellar genes were  incorporated in the evolutionary much older ANAC017-dependent mitochondrial  retrograde signaling pathway. Finally, a representative set of DUF295 T-DNA  insertion mutants was created. No obvious aberrant phenotypes during normal  growth and mitochondrial dysfunction were observed, most likely due to the large  extent of gene duplication and redundancy. Overall, this study provides insight  into how novel mitochondrial proteins can be created via "intercompartmental"  gene duplication events. Moreover, our analysis shows that these newly evolved  genes can then be specifically integrated into relevant, pre-existing  coexpression networks.', '2019 May 1', 'Mol Biol Evol', '10.1093/molbev/msz031', 'Van']
