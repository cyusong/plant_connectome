['28505379', 'Protein degradation by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway is important for the  regulation of cellular processes, but the function of most F-box proteins  relevant to substrate recognition is unknown. We describe the analysis of the  gene Cytokinin-induced F-box encoding (CFB, AT3G44326), identified in a  meta-analysis of cytokinin-related transcriptome studies as one of the most  robust cytokinin response genes. F-box domain-dependent interaction with the E3  ubiquitin ligase complex component ASK1 classifies CFB as a functional F-box  protein. Apart from F-box and transmembrane domains, CFB contains no known  functional domains. CFB is expressed in all plant tissues, predominantly in root  tissue. A ProCFB:GFP-GUS fusion gene showed strongest expression in the lateral  root cap and during lateral root formation. CFB-GFP fusion proteins were mainly  localized in the nucleus and the cytosol but also at the plasma membrane. cfb  mutants had no discernible phenotype, but CFB overexpressing plants showed  several defects, such as a white upper inflorescence stem, similar to the  hypomorphic cycloartenol synthase mutant cas1-1. Both CFB overexpressing plants  and cas1-1 mutants accumulated the CAS1 substrate 2,3-oxidosqualene in the white  stem tissue, the latter even more after cytokinin treatment, indicating  impairment of CAS1 function. This suggests that CFB may link cytokinin and the  sterol biosynthesis pathway.', '2017 May 17', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erx146', 'Schmulling']
