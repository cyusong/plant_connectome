The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) serve crucial roles in regulating plant growth and development and typically participate in biological processes by interacting with other TFs. Capsorubin and capsaicinoids are found only in Capsicum, which has high nutritional and economic value. However, whether bHLH family genes regulate capsorubin and capsaicinoid biosynthesis and participate in these processes by interacting with other TFs remains unknown. In this study, a total of 107 CabHLHs were identified from the Capsicum annuum genome. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that these CabHLH proteins were classified into 15 groups by comparing the CabHLH proteins with Arabidopsis thaliana bHLH proteins. The analysis showed that the expression profiles of CabHLH009, CabHLH032, CabHLH048, CabHLH095 and CabHLH100 found in clusters C1, C2, and C3 were similar to the profile of carotenoid biosynthesis in pericarp, including zeaxanthin, lutein and capsorubin, whereas the expression profiles of CabHLH007, CabHLH009, CabHLH026, CabHLH063 and CabHLH086 found in clusters L5, L6 and L9 were consistent with the profile of capsaicinoid accumulation in the placenta. Moreover, CabHLH007, CabHLH009, CabHLH026 and CabHLH086 also might be involved in temperature-mediated capsaicinoid biosynthesis. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays demonstrated that CabHLH007, CabHLH009, CabHLH026, CabHLH063 and CabHLH086 could interact with MYB31, a master regulator of capsaicinoid biosynthesis. The comprehensive and systematic analysis of CabHLH TFs provides useful information that contributes to further investigation of CabHLHs in carotenoid and capsaicinoid biosynthesis.
