Although the size of an organism is a defining feature, little is known about the mechanisms that set the final size of organs and whole organisms. Here we describe Arabidopsis DA1, encoding a predicted ubiquitin receptor, which sets final seed and organ size by restricting the period of cell proliferation. The mutant protein encoded by the da1-1 allele has a negative activity toward DA1 and a DA1-related (DAR) protein, and overexpression of a da1-1 cDNA dramatically increases seed and organ size of wild-type plants, identifying this small gene family as important regulators of seed and organ size in plants.
