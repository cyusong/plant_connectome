The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) controls many developmental and physiological processes. Here, we report that PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1) participates in ABA-mediated seed germination and early seedling development. The transcription of <i>PHO1</i> was obviously enhanced during seed germination and early seedling development and repressed by exogenous ABA. The <i>pho1</i> mutants (<i>pho1-2</i>, <i>pho1-4</i>, and <i>pho1-5</i>) showed ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes, whereas the <i>PHO1</i>-overexpressing lines were ABA-insensitive during seed germination and early seedling development. The expression of <i>PHO1</i> was repressed in the <i>ABI5</i>-overexpressing line and elevated in the <i>abi5</i> mutant, and ABI5 can bind to the <i>PHO1</i> promoter in vitro and in vivo, indicating that ABI5 directly down-regulated <i>PHO1</i> expression. Disruption of <i>PHO1</i> abolished the ABA-insensitive germination phenotypes of <i>abi5</i> mutant, demonstrating that <i>PHO1</i> was epistatic to <i>ABI5</i> Together, these data demonstrate that PHO1 is involved in ABA-mediated seed germination and early seedling development and transcriptionally regulated by ABI5.
