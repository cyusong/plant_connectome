['24104863', 'Using a combination of bioinformatics and synthetic promoters, novel  elicitor-responsive cis-sequences were discovered in promoters of  pathogen-upregulated genes from Arabidopsis thaliana. One group of functional  sequences contains the conserved core sequence GACTTTT. This core sequence and  adjacent nucleotides are essential for elicitor-responsive gene expression in a  parsley protoplast system. By yeast one-hybrid screening, WRKY70 was selected  with a cis-sequence harbouring the core sequence GACTTTT but no known WRKY  binding site (W-box). Transactivation experiments, mutation analyses, and  electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that the sequence CGACTTTT is  the binding site for WRKY70 in the investigated cis-sequence and is required for  WRKY70-activated gene expression. Using several cis-sequences in transactivation  experiments and binding studies, the CGACTTTT sequence can be extended to propose  YGACTTTT as WRKY70 binding site. This binding site, designated WT-box, is  enriched in promoters of genes upregulated in a WRKY70 overexpressing line.  Interestingly, functional WRKY70 binding sites are present in the promoter of  WRKY30, supporting recent evidence that both factors play a role in the same  regulatory network.', '2014 Mar', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-013-0136-y', 'Hehl']
