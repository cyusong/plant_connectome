Cytokinesis in plants is fundamentally different from that in animals and fungi. In plant cells, a cell plate forms through the fusion of cytokinetic vesicles and then develops into the new cell wall, partitioning the cytoplasm of the dividing cell. The formation of the cell plate entails multiple stages that involve highly orchestrated vesicle accumulation, fusion and membrane maturation, which occur concurrently with the timely deposition of polysaccharides such as callose, cellulose and cross-linking glycans. This review summarizes the major stages in cytokinesis, endomembrane components involved in cell plate assembly and its transition to a new cell wall. An animation that can be widely used for educational purposes further summarizes the process.
