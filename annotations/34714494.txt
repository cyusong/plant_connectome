An R2R3-MYB transcription factor, CmMYB9a, activates floral coloration in chrysanthemum by positively regulating CmCHS, CmDFR and CmFNS, but inhibiting the expression of CmFLS. Chrysanthemum is one of the most popular ornamental plants worldwide. Flavonoids, such as anthocyanins, flavones, and flavonols, are important secondary metabolites for coloration and are involved in many biological processes in plants, like petunia, snapdragon, Gerbera hybrida, as well as chrysanthemum. However, the metabolic regulation of flavonoids contributing to chrysanthemum floral coloration remains largely unexplored. Here, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, CmMYB9a, was found to be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. Phylogenetic analysis and amino acid sequence analysis suggested that CmMYB9a belonged to subgroup 7. Transient overexpression of CmMYB9a in flowers of chrysanthemum cultivar 'Anastasia Pink' upregulated the anthocyanin-related and flavone-related genes and downregulated CmFLS, which led to the accumulation of anthocyanins and flavones. We further demonstrated that CmMYB9a independently activates the expression of CmCHS, CmDFR and CmFNS, but inhibits the expression of CmFLS. Overexpression of CmMYB9a in tobacco resulted in increased anthocyanins and decreased flavonols in the petals by upregulating NtDFR and downregulating NtFLS. These results suggest that CmMYB9a facilitates metabolic flux into anthocyanin and flavone biosynthesis. Taken together, this study functionally characterizes the role of CmMYB9a in regulating the branched pathways of flavonoids in chrysanthemum flowers.
