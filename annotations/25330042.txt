['25330042', 'Membrane-delimited events play a crucial role for ABA signaling and PYR/PYL/RCAR  ABA receptors, clade A PP2Cs and SnRK2/CPK kinases modulate the activity of  different plasma membrane components involved in ABA action. Therefore, the  turnover of PYR/PYL/RCARs in the proximity of plasma membrane might be a step  that affects receptor function and downstream signaling. In this study we  describe a single-subunit RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase RSL1 that interacts with  the PYL4 and PYR1 ABA receptors at the plasma membrane. Overexpression of RSL1  reduces ABA sensitivity and rsl1 RNAi lines that impair expression of several  members of the RSL1/RFA gene family show enhanced sensitivity to ABA. RSL1 bears  a C-terminal transmembrane domain that targets the E3 ligase to plasma membrane.  Accordingly, bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC) studies showed the  RSL1-PYL4 and RSL1-PYR1 interaction is localized to plasma membrane. RSL1  promoted PYL4 and PYR1 degradation in vivo and mediated in vitro ubiquitylation  of the receptors. Taken together, these results suggest ubiquitylation of ABA  receptors at plasma membrane is a process that might affect their function via  effect on their half-life, protein interactions or trafficking.', '2014 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12708', 'Rodriguez']
