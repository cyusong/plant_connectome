Numerous studies have argued that environmental variations may contribute to evolution through the generation of novel heritable variations via meiotic recombination, which plays a crucial role in crop domestication and improvement. Rice is one of the most important staple crops, but no direct estimate of recombination events has yet been made at a fine scale. Here, we address this limitation by sequencing 41 rice individuals with high sequencing coverage and c. 900 000 accurate markers. An average of 33.9 crossover (c. 4.53 cM Mb(-1) ) and 2.47 non-crossover events were detected per F2 plant, which is similar to the values in Arabidopsis. Although not all samples in the stress treatment group showed an increased number of crossover events, environmental stress increased the recombination rate in c. 28.5% of samples. Interestingly, the crossovers showed a highly uneven distribution among and along chromosomes, with c. 13.9% of the entire genome devoid of crossovers, including 11 of the 12 centromere regions, and c. 0.72% of the genome containing large numbers of crossovers (> 50 cM Mb(-1) ). The gene ontology (GO) categories showed that genes clustered within the recombination hot spot regions primarily tended to be involved in responses to environmental stimuli, suggesting that recombination plays an important role for adaptive evolution in rapidly changing environments.
