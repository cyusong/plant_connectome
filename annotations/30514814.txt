['30514814', 'The perception and relay of cell-wall signals are critical for plants to regulate  growth and stress responses, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.  We found that the cell-wall leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRX) 3/4/5 are  critical for plant salt tolerance in Arabidopsis The LRXs physically associate  with the RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides RALF22/23, which in turn  interact with the plasma membrane-localized receptor-like protein kinase FERONIA  (FER). The lrx345 triple mutant as well as fer mutant plants display retarded  growth and salt hypersensitivity, which are mimicked by overexpression of  RALF22/23 Salt stress promotes S1P protease-dependent release of mature RALF22  peptides. Treatment of roots with mature RALF22/23 peptides or salt stress causes  the internalization of FER. Our results suggest that the LRXs, RALFs, and FER  function as a module to transduce cell-wall signals to regulate plant growth and  salt stress tolerance.', '2018 Dec 18', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1816991115', 'ORCID:']
