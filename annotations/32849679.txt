In wheat breeding, improved quality traits, including grain quality and dough rheological properties, have long been a critical goal. To understand the genetic basis of key quality traits of wheat, two single-locus and five multi-locus GWAS models were performed for six grain quality traits and three dough rheological properties based on 19, 254 SNPs in 267 bread wheat accessions. As a result, 299 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) within 105 regions were identified to be associated with these quality traits in four environments. Of which, 40 core QTN regions were stably detected in at least three environments, 19 of which were novel. Compared with the previous studies, these novel QTN regions explained smaller phenotypic variation, which verified the advantages of the multi-locus GWAS models in detecting important small effect QTNs associated with complex traits. After characterization of the function and expression in-depth, 67 core candidate genes involved in protein/sugar synthesis, histone modification and the regulation of transcription factor were observed to be associated with the formation of grain quality, which showed that multi-level regulations influenced wheat grain quality. Finally, a preliminary network of gene regulation that may affect wheat quality formation was inferred. This study verified the power and reliability of multi-locus GWAS methods in wheat quality trait research, and increased the understanding of wheat quality formation mechanisms. The detected QTN regions and candidate genes in this study could be further used for gene cloning and marker-assisted selection in high-quality breeding of bread wheat.
