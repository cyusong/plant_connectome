In recent years, many small RNAs and long non-protein-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified and characterized. They have been proved to play essential regulatory roles in gene expression in both primary and secondary metabolisms. In nature, many plants produce alkaloids. However, there are only few reports on the involvement of non-coding RNAs in alkaloid biosynthesis. Nicotine is major alkaloid in tobacco plants. Its biosynthesis and regulation in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) have been well studied; and major structural genes involved in the nicotine biosynthesis and transcriptional regulators related to its biosynthesis have been identified and characterized. In our recent studies, we identified a microRNA (nta-miRX27) and also a lncRNA (nta-eTMX27) as an endogenous target mimicry (eTM) in tobacco targeting the nicotine biosynthesis key gene QPT2 encoding quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPT) and thereby regulating the nicotine content. Their regulatory pattern leads us to conclude that nicotine biosynthesis is regulated by 2 more layers besides previously known mechanisms. Future study on the relationship between the non-coding RNAs and transcription factors in nicotine biosynthesis was discussed in this article.
