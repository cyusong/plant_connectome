The ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) DOMAIN (ASL/LBD) genes encode plant-specific nuclear proteins containing the conserved domain AS2/LOB. In this study, the function of a member of the Arabidopsis thaliana AS2/LOB gene family, ASL11/LBD15, was investigated. The results show that ASL11/LBD15 is expressed in the meristems of shoot apex, root apex, organ boundaries, and developing seeds. Overexpression of ASL11/LBD15 resulted in aberrant arrangements in the tunica cell layers of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Two-week-old transgenic plants developed needle-like leaves in addition to regular leaves, while 6-week-old transformants displayed clustered cauline leaves suggesting altered SAM development. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the WUSCHEL (WUS) transcript level was strongly up-regulated in plants overexpressing ASL11/LBD15 compared with the wild-type plants. Furthermore, inducible ASL11/LBD15 ectopic expression activated ectopic expression of WUS and affected the differentiation of leaf epidermal cells. Therefore, our results suggest that ASL11/LBD15 affects cellular differentiation in the SAM and regulates WUS expression.
