Taxol is a rare secondary metabolite that accumulates considerably in <i>Taxus</i> species under salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate treatment. However, the molecular mechanism of its accumulation remains unclear. We investigated <i>TcWRKY33</i>, a nuclear-localized group I WRKY transcription factor, as an SA-responsive regulator of taxol biosynthesis. Overexpression and RNA interference of <i>TcWRKY33</i> confirmed that <i>TcWRKY33</i> regulates the expression of most taxol biosynthesis genes, especially <i>10-deacetylbaccatin III-10-O-acetyltransferase</i> (<i>DBAT</i>) and <i>taxadiene synthase</i> (<i>TASY</i>), which were considered as key enzymes in taxol biosynthesis. Transient overexpression of <i>TcWRKY33</i> in <i>Taxus chinensis</i> leaves resulted in increased taxol and 10-deacetylbaccatin accumulation by 1.20 and 2.16 times compared with the control, respectively. Furthermore, <i>TcWRKY33, DBAT</i>, and <i>TASY</i> were confirmed to respond positively to SA signals. These results suggested that <i>TcWRKY33</i> was the missing component of taxol biosynthesis that responds to SA. The sequence analysis identified two W-box motifs in the promoter of <i>DBAT</i> but not in the <i>TASY</i>. Yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase activity assays confirmed that <i>TcWRKY33</i> can bind to the two W-boxes in the promoter of <i>DBAT</i>, upregulating its expression level. Hence, <i>DBAT</i> is a direct target of <i>TcWRKY33</i>. Furthermore, <i>TcERF15</i>, encoding a <i>TASY</i> activator, also contains two W-boxes in its promoter. Yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase activity assays further confirmed that <i>TcWRKY33</i> can upregulate <i>TASY</i> expression through the activation of <i>TcERF15</i>. In summary, <i>TcWRKY33</i> transmits SA signals and positively regulates taxol biosynthesis genes in two ways: directly and through the activation of other activators. Therefore, <i>TcWRKY33</i> is an excellent candidate for genetically engineering regulation of taxol biosynthesis in <i>Taxus</i> plants.
