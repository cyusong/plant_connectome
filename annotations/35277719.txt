Silicon (Si) is an important nutrient required for sustainable and high production of rice and its uptake is mediated by a pair of influx (OsLsi1)-efflux (OsLsi2) transporters showing polar localization. However, the mechanisms underlying their polarity are unknown. Here, we revealed that the polarity of the Si transporters depends on cell types. The polar localization of both OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was not altered by Si supply, but their protein abundance was reduced. Double immunostaining showed that localization of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was separated at the edge of the lateral polar domain by Casparian strips in the endodermis, whereas they were slightly overlapped at the transversal side of the exodermis. When OsLsi1 was ectopically expressed in the shoots, it showed polar localization at the xylem parenchyma cells of the basal node and leaf sheath, but not at the phloem companion cells. Ectopic expression of non-polar Si transporters, barley HvLsi2 and maize ZmLsi2 in rice, resulted in their polar localization at the proximal side. The polar localization of OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 was not altered by inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) by dominant-negative induction of dynamin-related protein1A and knockout of mu subunit of adaptor protein 2 complex, although the knockout mutants of OsAP2M gene showed dwarf phenotype. These results indicate that CME is not required for the polar localization of Si transporters. Taken together, our results indicate that CME-independent machinery controls the polar localization of Si transporters in exodermis, endodermis of root cells and xylem parenchyma cells.
