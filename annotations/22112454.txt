We have recently identified a new class III chitinase from pomegranate seeds (PSC). Interestingly, this new chitinase naturally binds calcium ions with high capacity and low affinity, suggesting that PSC is a Ca-storage protein. Analysis of the amino acid sequence showed that this enzyme is rich in acidic amino acid residues, especially Asp, which are responsible for calcium binding. Different from other known chitinases, PSC is located in the stroma of amyloplasts in pomegranate seeds. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis indicated that the embryonic cells of pomegranate seeds are rich in calcium ions, most of which are distributed in the stroma and the starch granule of the amyloplasts, consistent with the above idea that PSC is involved in calcium storage, a newly non-defensive function.
