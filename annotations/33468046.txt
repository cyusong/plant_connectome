Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV) is a severe threat to winter wheat and is transmitted by Polymyxa graminis. The mechanisms of interactions between CWMV and plants are poorly understood. In this study, a comparative proteomics analysis based on nanoliquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS)/MS was conducted to characterize proteomic changes in plants responding to CWMV infection. In total, 2751 host proteins were identified, 1496 of which were quantified and 146 up-regulated and 244 down-regulated proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that DEPs were most strongly associated with photosynthesis antenna proteins, MAPK signaling plant and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways. Subcellular localization analysis predicted that more than half of the DEPs were localized in the chloroplast, an organelle indispensable for abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis. Our results suggest that CWMV infection interrupts normal chloroplast functions and decreases ABA concentrations in Nicotiana benthamiana. Further analysis showed that the ABA pathway was suppressed during CWMV infection and that ABA treatment induced plant hosts defenses against CWMV. We identified several candidate proteins expressed during CWMV infection, and the ABA pathway was strongly associated with responses to CWMV infection in N. benthamiana.
