Plant height (PH) is a key plant architecture trait for improving the biological productivity of cotton. Ideal PH of cotton is conducive to lodging resistance and mechanized harvesting. To detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes of PH in cotton, a genetic map was constructed with a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of upland cotton. PH phenotype data under nine environments and three best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) were used for QTL analyses. Based on restriction-site-associated DNA sequence (RAD-seq), the genetic map contained 5,850 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, covering 2,747.12 cM with an average genetic distance of 0.47 cM. Thirty-seven unconditional QTL explaining 1.03-12.50% of phenotypic variance, including four major QTL and seven stable QTL, were identified. Twenty-eight conditional QTL explaining 3.27-28.87% of phenotypic variance, including 1 major QTL, were identified. Importantly, five QTL, including 4 stable QTL, were both unconditional and conditional QTL. Among the 60 PH QTL (including 39 newly identified), none of them were involved in the whole period of PH growth, indicating that QTL related to cotton PH development have dynamic expression characteristics. Based on the functional annotation of <i>Arabidopsis</i> homologous genes and transcriptome data of upland cotton TM-1, 14 candidate genes were predicted within 10 QTL. Our research provides valuable information for understanding the genetic mechanism of PH development, which also increases the economic production of cotton.
