Plants are exposed to increasingly severe drought events and roots play vital roles in maintaining plant survival, growth, and reproduction. A large body of literature has investigated the adaptive responses of root traits in various plants to water stress and these studies have been reviewed in certain groups of plant species at a certain scale. Nevertheless, these responses have not been synthesized at multiple levels. This paper screened over 2000 literatures for studies of typical root traits including root growth angle, root depth, root length, root diameter, root dry weight, root-to-shoot ratio, root hair length and density and integrates their drought responses at genetic and morphological scales. The genes, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and hormones that are involved in the regulation of drought response of the root traits were summarized. We then statistically analyzed the drought responses of root traits and discussed the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, we highlighted the drought response of 1-D and 2-D root length density (RLD) distribution in the soil profile. This paper will provide a framework for an integrated understanding of root adaptive responses to water deficit at multiple scales and such insights may provide a basis for selection and breeding of drought tolerant crop lines.
