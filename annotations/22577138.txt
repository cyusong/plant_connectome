['22577138', 'Plant photoreceptors transduce environmental light cues to downstream signaling  pathways, regulating a wide array of processes during growth and development. Two  major plant photoreceptors with critical roles in photomorphogenesis are  phytochrome B (phyB), a red/far-red absorbing photoreceptor, and cryptochrome 1  (CRY1), a UV-A/blue photoreceptor. Despite substantial genetic evidence for  cross-talk between phyB and CRY1 pathways, a direct interaction between these  proteins has not been observed. Here, we report that Arabidopsis phyB interacts  directly with CRY1 in a light-dependent interaction. Surprisingly, the  interaction is light-dissociated; CRY1 interacts specifically with the  dark/far-red (Pr) state of phyB, but not with the red light-activated (Pfr) or  the chromophore unconjugated form of the enzyme. The interaction is also  regulated by light activation of CRY1; phyB Pr interacts only with the  unstimulated form of CRY1 but not with the photostimulated protein. Further  studies reveal that a small domain extending from the photolyase homology region  (PHR) of CRY1 regulates the specificity of the interaction with different  conformational states of phyB. We hypothesize that in plants, the phyB/CRY1  interaction may mediate cross-talk between the red/far-red- and blue/UV-sensing  pathways, enabling fine-tuning of light responses to different spectral inputs.', '2012 Jun 22', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M112.360545', 'Tucker']
