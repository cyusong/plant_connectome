Perception of environmental cues and adaptation to changing environmental conditions are crucial for survival of sessile organisms like plants. This is even more important for woody perennial species like trees that can occupy a site for thousands of years. We have previously shown that under low nitrogen (LN), poplar trees display a vigorous and long-lasting root growth associated with global transcriptomic reprogramming and an activation of hierarchical genetic networks. Here we use computational analysis to better understand the network among the genes showing distinct chronological patterns of expression during the response. Our analyses confirm the previous findings, define new potential signaling pathways and the possible downstream targets of these signaling events.
