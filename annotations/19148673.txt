['19148673', 'Three AtHsp90 isoforms, cytosolic AtHsp90.2, chloroplast-located AtHsp90.5, and  endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-located AtHsp90.7, were characterized by constitutive  overexpressing their genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Both types of the transgenic  plants overexpressing cytosolic and organellar AtHsp90s showed reduced tolerance  to salt and drought stresses with lower germination rates and fresh weights, but  improved tolerance to high concentration of Ca(2+) comparing with the wild type  plants. Transcriptional analysis of ABA-responsive genes, RD29A, RD22 and KIN2  under salt and drought stresses, indicated that the induction expression of these  genes was delayed by constitutive overexpression of cytosolic AtHsp90.2, but was  hardly affected by that of organellar AtHsp90.5 and AtHsp90.7. These results  implied that Arabidopsis different cellular compartments-located Hsp90s in  Arabidopsis might be involved in abiotic stresses by different functional  mechanisms, probably through ABA-dependent or Ca(2+) pathways, and proper  homeostasis of Hsp90 was critical for cellular stress response and/or tolerance  in plants.', '2009 Mar', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-008-0886-y', 'Li']
