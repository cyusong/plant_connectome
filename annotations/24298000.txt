When plants develop, cell proliferation and cell expansion are tightly controlled in order to generate organs with a determinate final size such as leaves. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of the cell proliferation phase for leaf growth, illustrating that cell-cycle regulation is crucial for correct leaf development. A large and complex set of interacting proteins that constitute the cell-cycle interactome controls the transition from one cell-cycle phase to another. Here, we review the current knowledge on cell-cycle regulators from this interactome affecting final leaf size when their expression is altered, mainly in Arabidopsis. In addition to the description of mutants of CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASES (CDKs), CYCLINS (CYCs), and their transcriptional and post-translational regulators, a phenotypic analysis of gain- and loss-of-function mutants for 27 genes encoding proteins that interact with cell-cycle proteins is presented. This compilation of information shows that when cell-cycle-related genes are mis-expressed, leaf growth is often altered and that, seemingly, three main trends appear to be crucial in the regulation of final organ size by cell-cycle-related genes: (i) cellular compensation; (ii) gene dosage; and (iii) correct transition through the G2/M phase by ANAPHASE PROMOTING COMPLEX/CYCLOSOME (APC/C) activation. In conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that the cell-cycle interactome is enriched in leaf growth regulators, and illustrates the potential to identify new leaf growth regulators among putative new cell-cycle regulators.
