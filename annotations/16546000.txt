A non-destructive nitrogen (N) detector [Agriexpert PPW-3000 (PPW-3000)] is a useful device for rapid and non-destructive measurement of leaf N content. However, some studies find a poor correlation between the PPW-3000 reading and the actual leaf N content; the R2 value of the approximate equation was low. To improve the accuracy of N estimation, we determined the approximate equation taking into account the leaf development stage (maturing and mature leaves) and leaf flush type (early and late leaves). For the leaf development stage, we determined approximate equations for maturing leaves (Ya), mature leaves (Yb), and "maturing+mature" leaves (Yc) in species having simultaneous leaf emergence. The resulting accuracy of Ya, Yb, and Yc was quite high. For leaf flush species, we determined approximate equations for early leaves (Y1), late leaves (Y2), and "early+late" leaves (Y3) in species having heterophyllous leaf emergence. The accuracy of Y1 and Y2 was relatively high, but that of Y3 was low. We conclude that, when using a PPW-3000, we can determine an approximate equation for maturing and mature leaves jointly, but should treat early and late leaves separately.
