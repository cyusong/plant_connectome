Upregulation of the C4 metabolic cycle is a major step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. Why this happened remains unclear, in part because of difficulties measuring the C4 cycle in situ in C3-C4 intermediate species. Now, Alonso-Cantabrana and von Caemmerer (2016) have described a new approach for quantifying C4 cycle activity, thereby providing the means to analyze its upregulation in an evolutionary context.

C4 cycle: !upregulated in! Evolution
Alonso-Cantabrana and von Caemmerer: !provide! New approach
New approach: !quantifies! C4 cycle activity
C3-C4 intermediate species: !difficult to measure! C4 cycle
