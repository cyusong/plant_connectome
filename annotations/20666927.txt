Photosynthesis is sensitive to high temperature with reversible declines during moderate stress and irreversible damage with more severe stress. While many studies have focused on the irreversible damage, the reversible changes can tell how photosynthesis tolerates high temperature. Knowing how high temperature is tolerated could lead to ways of extending high temperature tolerance. New analytical methods have been used to probe electron and proton circuits of intact leaves at high temperature. Combined with previous work with isolated systems, it appears that there is a large change in redox distribution among thylakoid components. Photosystem I becomes more reduced but photosystem II and the stroma become more oxidized. Several lines of evidence support the existence of significant cyclic electron flow at high temperature. It is hypothesized that these changes allow for adenosine tri-phosphate homeostasis and maintenance of an energy gradient across the thylakoid membrane, helping to keep it from suffering irreversible damage at high temperature.

Photosystem I: !becomes more reduced! 
Photosystem II/Stroma: !become more oxidized! 
Cyclic electron flow: !exists at high temperature! 
ATP homeostasis: !maintains energy gradient!
