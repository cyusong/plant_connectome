['29255112', 'Gibberellins (GAs) modulate diverse developmental processes throughout the plant  life cycle. However, the interaction between GAs and the circadian rhythm remains  unclear. Here, we report that MUT9p-LIKE KINASE1 (MLK1) and MLK2 mediate the  interaction between GAs and the circadian clock to regulate hypocotyl elongation  in Arabidopsis thaliana DELLA proteins function as master growth repressors that  integrate phytohormone signaling and environmental pathways in plant development.  MLK1 and MLK2 interact with the DELLA protein REPRESSOR OF ga1-3 (RGA). Loss of  MLK1 and MLK2 function results in plants with short hypocotyls and  hyposensitivity to GAs. MLK1/2 and RGA directly interact with CIRCADIAN CLOCK  ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1), which targets the promoter of DWARF4 (DWF4) to regulate its  roles in cell expansion. MLK1/2 antagonize the ability of RGA to bind CCA1, and  these factors coordinately regulate the expression of DWF4 RGA suppressed the  ability of CCA1 to activate expression from the DWF4 promoter, but MLK1/2  reversed this suppression. Genetically, MLK1/2 act in the same pathway as RGA and  CCA1 in hypocotyl elongation. Together, our results provide insight into the  mechanism by which MLK1 and MLK2 antagonize the function of RGA in hypocotyl  elongation and suggest that MLK1/2 coordinately mediate the regulation of plant  development by GAs and the circadian rhythm in Arabidopsis.', '2018 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00830', 'Ding']
