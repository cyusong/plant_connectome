Membrane Attack Complex and Perforin (MACPF) proteins play crucial roles in plant development and plant responses to environmental stresses. To date, only four <i>MACPF</i> genes have been identified in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, and the functions of the <i>MACPF</i> gene family members in other plants, especially in important crop plants, such as the Poaceae family, remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified and analyzed 42 <i>MACPF</i> genes from six completely sequenced and well annotated species representing the major Poaceae clades. A phylogenetic analysis of <i>MACPF</i> genes resolved four groups, characterized by shared motif organizations and gene structures within each group. <i>MACPF</i> genes were unevenly distributed along the Poaceae chromosomes. Moreover, segmental duplications and dispersed duplication events may have played significant roles during <i>MACPF</i> gene family expansion and functional diversification in the Poaceae. In addition, phylogenomic synteny analysis revealed a high degree of conservation among the Poaceae <i>MACPF</i> genes. In particular, Group I, II, and III <i>MACPF</i> genes were exposed to strong purifying selection with different evolutionary rates. Temporal and spatial expression analyses suggested that Group III <i>MACPF</i> genes were highly expressed relative to the other groups. In addition, most <i>MACPF</i> genes were highly expressed in vegetative tissues and up-regulated by several biotic and abiotic stresses. Taken together, these findings provide valuable information for further functional characterization and phenotypic validation of the Poaceae <i>MACPF</i> gene family.
