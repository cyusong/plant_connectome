['20042021', 'Geminiviruses include a large number of single-stranded DNA viruses that are  emerging as useful tools to dissect many fundamental processes in plant hosts.  However, there have been no reports yet regarding the genetic dissection of the  geminivirus-plant interaction. Here, a high-throughput approach was developed to  screen Arabidopsis activation-tagged mutants which are resistant to geminivirus  Beet severe curly top virus (BSCTV) infection. A mutant, lsb1 (less susceptible  to BSCTV 1), was identified, in which BSCTV replication was impaired and BSCTV  infectivity was reduced. We found that the three genes closest to the T-DNA were  up-regulated in lsb1, and the phenotypes of lsb1 could only be recapitulated by  the overexpression of GDU3 (GLUTAMINE DUMPER 3), a gene implicated in amino acid  transport. We further demonstrated that activation of LSB1/GDU3 increased the  expression of components in the salicylic acid (SA) pathway, which is known to  counter geminivirus infection, including the upstream regulator ACD6. These data  indicate that up-regulation of LSB1/GDU3 affects BSCTV infection by activating  the SA pathway. This study thus provides a new approach to study of the  geminivirus-host interaction.', '2010 Apr 1', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04120.x', 'Xie']
