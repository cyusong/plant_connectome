The normal developmental sequence in a grass grain entails the death of several maternal and filial tissues in a genetically regulated process termed programmed cell death (PCD). The progression and molecular aspects of PCD in developing grains have been reported for domesticated species such as barley, rice, maize and wheat. Here, we report a detailed investigation of PCD in the developing grain of the wild model species <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>. We detected PCD in developing <i>Brachypodium</i> grains using molecular and histological approaches. We also identified in <i>Brachypodium</i> the orthologs of protease genes known to contribute to grain PCD and surveyed their expression. We found that, similar to cereals, PCD in the <i>Brachypodium</i> nucellus occurs in a centrifugal pattern following anthesis. However, compared to cereals, the rate of post-mortem clearance in the <i>Brachypodium</i> nucellus is slower. However, compared to wheat and barley, mesocarp PCD in <i>Brachypodium</i> proceeds more rapidly in lateral cells. Remarkably, <i>Brachypodium</i> mesocarp PCD is not coordinated with endosperm development. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that barley and wheat possess more vacuolar processing enzymes that drive nucellar PCD compared to <i>Brachypodium</i> and rice. Our expression analysis highlighted putative grain-specific PCD proteases in <i>Brachypodium</i>. Combined with existing knowledge on grain PCD, our study suggests that the rate of nucellar PCD moderates grain size and that the pattern of mesocarp PCD influences grain shape.
