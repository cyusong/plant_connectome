['18657430', 'Flavanone 3beta-hydroxylase (F3H; EC 1.14.11.9) is a 2-oxoglutarate dependent  dioxygenase that catalyzes the synthesis of dihydrokaempferol, the common  precursor for three major classes of 3-hydroxy flavonoids, the flavonols,  anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins. This enzyme also competes for flux into the  3-deoxy flavonoid branch pathway in some species. F3H genes are increasingly  being used, often together with genes encoding other enzymes, to engineer  flavonoid synthesis in microbes and plants. Although putative F3H genes have been  cloned in a large number of plant species, only a handful have been functionally  characterized. Here we describe the biochemical properties of the Arabidopsis  thaliana F3H (AtF3H) enzyme and confirm the activities of gene products from four  other plant species previously identified as having high homology to F3H. We have  also investigated the surprising "leaky" phenotype of AtF3H mutant alleles,  uncovering evidence that two related flavonoid enzymes, flavonol synthase (EC  1.14.11.23) and anthocyanidin synthase (EC 1.14.11.19), can partially compensate  for F3H in vivo. These experiments further indicate that the absence of F3H in  these lines enables the synthesis of uncommon 3-deoxy flavonoids in the  Arabidopsis seed coat.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2008.06.004', 'Winkel']
