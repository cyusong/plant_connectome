['14730064', 'Calcium signals mediate a multitude of plant responses to external stimuli and  regulate a wide range of physiological processes. Calcium-binding proteins, like  calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins, represent important relays in plant calcium  signaling. These proteins form a complex network with their target kinases being  the CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). Here, we present a comparative  genomics analysis of the full complement of CBLs and CIPKs in Arabidopsis and  rice (Oryza sativa). We confirm the expression and transcript composition of the  10 CBLs and 25 CIPKs encoded in the Arabidopsis genome. Our identification of 10  CBLs and 30 CIPKs from rice indicates a similar complexity of this signaling  network in both species. An analysis of the genomic evolution suggests that the  extant number of gene family members largely results from segmental duplications.  A phylogenetic comparison of protein sequences and intron positions indicates an  early diversification of separate branches within both gene families. These  branches may represent proteins with different functions. Protein interaction  analyses and expression studies of closely related family members suggest that  even recently duplicated representatives may fulfill different functions. This  work provides a basis for a defined further functional dissection of this  important plant-specific signaling system.', '2004 Jan', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.033068', 'Kudla']
