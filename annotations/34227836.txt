Technological advances in genome sequencing have improved our ability to catalog genomic variation and have led to an expansion of the scope and scale of genetic studies over the past decade. Yet, for agronomically important plant pathogens such as the downy mildews (<i>Peronosporaceae</i>), the scale of genetic studies remains limited. This is, in part, due to the difficulties associated with maintaining obligate pathogens and the logistical constraints involved in the genotyping of these species (e.g., obtaining DNA of sufficient quantity and quality). To gain an evolutionary and ecological perspective of downy mildews, adaptable methods for the genotyping of their populations are required. Here, we describe a targeted enrichment (TE) protocol to genotype isolates from two <i>Pseudoperonospora</i> species (<i>P. cubensis</i> and <i>P. humuli</i>), using less than 50 ng of mixed pathogen and plant DNA for library preparation. We were able to enrich 830 target genes across 128 samples and identified 2,514 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants. Using these SNPs, we detected significant genetic differentiation (analysis of molecular variance [AMOVA], <i>P</i> = 0.01) between <i>P. cubensis</i> subpopulations from <i>Cucurbita moschata</i> (clade I) and <i>Cucumis sativus</i> (clade II) in the state of Michigan. No evidence of location-based differentiation was detected within the <i>P. cubensis</i> (clade II) subpopulation in Michigan. However, a significant effect of location on the genetic variation of the <i>P. humuli</i> subpopulation was detected in the state (AMOVA, <i>P</i> = 0.01). Mantel tests found evidence that the genetic distance among <i>P. humuli</i> samples was associated with the physical distance of the hop yards from which the samples were collected (<i>P</i> = 0.005). The differences in the distribution of genetic variation of the Michigan <i>P. humuli</i> and <i>P. cubensis</i> subpopulations suggest differences in the dispersal of these two species. The TE protocol described here provides an additional tool for genotyping obligate biotrophic plant pathogens and the execution of new genetic studies.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
