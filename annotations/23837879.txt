['23837879', 'Lipocalins are a group of multifunctional proteins, recognized as carriers of  small lipophilic molecules, which have been characterized in bacteria and  animals. Two true lipocalins have been recently identified in plants, the  temperature-induced lipocalin (TIL) and the chloroplastic lipocalin (CHL), the  expression of which is induced by various abiotic stresses. Each lipocalin  appeared to be specialized in the responses to specific stress conditions in  Arabidopsis thaliana, with AtTIL and AtCHL playing a protective role against heat  and high light, respectively. The double mutant AtCHL KO x AtTIL KO deficient in  both lipocalins was more sensitive to temperature, drought and light stresses  than the single mutants, exhibiting intense lipid peroxidation. AtCHL deficiency  dramatically enhanced the photosensitivity of mutants (vte1, npq1) affected in  lipid protection mechanisms (tocopherols, zeaxanthin), confirming the role of  lipocalins in the prevention of lipid peroxidation. Seeds of the AtCHL KO x AtTIL  KO double mutant were very sensitive to natural and artificial ageing, and again  this phenomenon was associated with the oxidation of polyunsaturated lipids. The  presented results show that the Arabidopsis lipocalins AtTIL and AtCHL have  overlapping functions in lipid protection which are essential for stress  resistance and survival.', '2014 Feb', 'Plant Cell Environ', '10.1111/pce.12159', 'Havaux']
