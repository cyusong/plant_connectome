Parent-of-origin effects arise when a phenotype depends on whether it is inherited maternally or paternally. Parent-of-origin effects can exert a strong influence on F1 seed size in flowering plants, an important agronomic and life-history trait that can contribute to biomass heterosis. Here we investigate the natural variation in the relative contributions of the maternal and paternal genomes to F1 seed size across 71 reciprocal pairs of F1 hybrid diploids and the parental effect on F1 seed size heterosis. We demonstrate that the paternally derived genome influences F1 seed size more significantly than previously appreciated. We further demonstrate (by disruption of parental genome dosage balance in F1 triploid seeds) that hybridity acts as an enhancer of genome dosage effects on F1 seed size, beyond that observed from hybridity or genome dosage effects on their own. Our findings indicate that interactions between genetic hybridity and parental genome dosage can enhance heterosis effects in plants, opening new avenues for boosting heterosis breeding in crop plants.
