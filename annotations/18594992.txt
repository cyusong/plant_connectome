Leaves, the collective organ produced by the shoot apical meristem (SAM), are polarized along their adaxial-abaxial axis. In this study, we characterized two rice (Oryza sativa) allelic rolled-leaf mutants, rolled leaf 9-1 (rl9-1) and rl9-2, which display very similar phenotypes with completely adaxialized leaves and malformed spikelets. We cloned the RL9 gene by way of a map-based cloning strategy. Molecular studies have revealed that RL9 encodes a GARP protein, an orthologue of Arabidopsis KANADIs. RL9 is mainly expressed in roots, leaves, and flowers. The transient expression of a RL9-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein has indicated that RL9 protein is localized in the nucleus, suggesting that RL9 acts as a putative transcription factor.
