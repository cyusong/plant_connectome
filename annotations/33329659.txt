The ability to create targeted mutations using clustered regularly inter-spaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 in support of forest tree biotechnology is currently limited. CRISPR/Cas12a is a novel CRISPR effector protein that not only broadens the CRISPR/Cas targeting range but also enables the generation of large-fragment deletions. In this study, a CRISPR/Cas12a system was evaluated for the induction of targeted mutations in the woody tree poplar (<i>Populus alba</i> × <i>Populus glandulosa</i>). Three Cas12a nucleases, namely, AsCas12a (<i>Acidaminococcus</i> sp. BV3L6), LbCas12a (Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006), and FnCas12a (<i>Francisella tularensis</i> subsp. <i>novicidain</i> U112), were used. We knocked out multiple targets of the <i>phytoene desaturase gene 8</i> (<i>PDS</i>) using the CRISPR/Cas12a genome-targeting system, and the results indicated that the AsCas12a system is the most efficient. We further optimized the co-cultivation temperature after <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation from 22 to 28°C to increase the Cas12a nuclease editing efficiency in poplar. AsCas12a showed the highest mutation efficiency, at 70%, and the majority of editing sites were composed of large-fragment deletions. By using this simple and high-efficiency CRISPR/Cas12a system, multiple targets can be modified to obtain multigene simultaneous knockout mutants in tree species, which will provide powerful tools with which to facilitate genetic studies of forest trees.
