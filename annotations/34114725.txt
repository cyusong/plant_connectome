Processing of mature transfer RNAs (tRNAs) produces complex populations of tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs). Emerging evidence shows that tRFs have important functions in bacteria, animals, and plants. Here, we review recent advances in understanding plant tRFs, focusing on their biological and cellular functions, such as regulating stress responses, mediating plant-pathogen interactions, and modulating post-transcriptional gene silencing and translation. We also review sequencing strategies and bioinformatics resources for studying tRFs in plants. Finally, we discuss future directions for plant tRF research, which will expand our knowledge of plant non-coding RNAs.
