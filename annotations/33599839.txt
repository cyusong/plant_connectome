A total of 6763 proteins were identified in the developing pear flesh, which were further screened for differentially expressed proteins related to fruit quality and ATP-binding cassette transporters. To obtain further details on changes in protein levels during fruit ripening and to identify and evaluate changes in various metabolic pathways that affect fruit quality, a proteomic method using tandem mass tags was implemented at three developmental stages in Pyrus pyrifolia cv. "Hosui" that identified 6763 proteins. Subcellular localization and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed major functions of all identified proteins. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis suggested that all metabolic processes are reflected in the up- and downregulation of differentially expressed proteins during fruit development, which play predominant roles in cell division, cell expansion, and fruit ripening. Among the examined differentially expressed proteins, 160 related to fruit quality, and 14 ATP-binding cassette transporters related to fruit development were identified and analyzed. The quantitative data were validated by parallel reaction monitoring, which confirmed the reliability of the experimental results.
