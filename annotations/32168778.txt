The regulatory mechanisms of pollen development have potential value for applications in agriculture, such as better understanding plant reproductive regularity. Pollen-specific promoters are of vital importance for the ectopic expression of functional genes associated with pollen development in plants. However, there is a limited number of successful applications using pollen-specific promoters in genetic engineering for crop breeding and hybrid generation. Our previous work led to the identification and isolation of the <i>OsSUT3</i> promoter from rice. In this study, to analyze the effects of different putative regulatory motifs in the <i>OsSUT3</i> promoter, a series of promoter deletions were fused to a <i>GUS</i> reporter gene and then stably introduced into rice and <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Histochemical GUS analysis of transgenic plants revealed that p385 (from -385 to -1) specifically mediated maximal GUS expression in pollen tissues. The S region (from -385 to -203) was the key region for controlling the pollen-specific expression of a downstream gene. The E1 (-967 to -606), E2 (-202 to -120), and E3 (-119 to -1) regions enhanced ectopic promoter activity to different degrees. Moreover, the p385 promoter could alter the expression pattern of the 35S promoter and improve its activity when they were fused together. In summary, the p385 promoter, a short and high-activity promoter, can function to drive pollen-specific expression of transgenes in monocotyledon and dicotyledon transformation experiments.
