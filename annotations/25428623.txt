In plants, the uptake from soil and intercellular transport of inorganic phosphate (Pi) is mediated by the PHT1 family of membrane-spanning proton : Pi symporters. The Arabidopsis thaliana AtPHT1 gene family comprises nine putative high-affinity Pi transporters. While AtPHT1;1 to AtPHT1;4 are involved in Pi acquisition from the rhizosphere, the role of the remaining transporters is less clear. Pi uptake and tissue accumulation studies in AtPHT1;8 and AtPHT1;9 knock-out mutants compared to wild-type plants showed that both transporters are involved in the translocation of Pi from the root to the shoot. Upon inactivation of AtPHT1;9, changes in the transcript profiles of several genes that respond to plant phosphorus (P) status indicated a possible role in the regulation of systemic signaling of P status within the plant. Potential genetic interactions were found among PHT1 transporters, as the transcript profile of AtPHT1;5 and AtPHT1;7 was altered in the absence of AtPHT1;8, and the transcript profile of AtPHT1;7 was altered in the Atpht1;9 mutant. These results indicate that AtPHT1;8 and AtPHT1;9 translocate Pi from the root to the shoot, but not from the soil solution into the root. AtPHT1;8 and AtPHT1;9 are likely to act sequentially in the interior of the plant during the root-to-shoot translocation of Pi, and play a more complex role in the acclimation of A. thaliana to changes in Pi supply than was previously thought.
