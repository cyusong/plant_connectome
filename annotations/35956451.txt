['35956451', 'Pollen plays an essential role in plant fertility by delivering the male gametes  to the embryo sac before double fertilization. In several plant species,  including Arabidopsis, C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factors (TFs) have  been involved in different stages of pollen development and maturation. ZINC  FINGER of Arabidopsis thaliana 4 (AtZAT4) is homologous to such TFs and  subcellular localization analysis has revealed that AtZAT4 is located in the  nucleus. Moreover, analysis of AtZAT4 expression revealed strong levels of it in  flowers and siliques, suggesting a role of the encoded protein in the regulation  of genes that are associated with reproductive development. We characterized a  T-DNA insertional heterozygous mutant Atzat4 (+/-). The relative gene expression  analysis of Atzat4 (+/-) showed significant transcript reductions in flowers and  siliques. Furthermore, the Atzat4 (+/-) phenotypic characterization revealed  defects in the male germline, showing a reduction in pollen tube germination and  elongation. Atzat4 (+/-) presented reduced fertility, characterized by a smaller  silique size compared to the wild type (WT), and a lower number of seeds per  silique. Additionally, seeds displayed lower viability and germination.  Altogether, our data suggest a role for AtZAT4 in fertilization and seed  viability, through the regulation of gene expression associated with reproductive  development.', '2022 Jul 29', 'Plants (Basel)', '10.3390/plants11151974', 'ORCID:']
