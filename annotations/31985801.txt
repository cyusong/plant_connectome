Deficiency of the essential nutrient boron (B) in the soil is one of the most widespread micronutrient deficiencies worldwide, leading to developmental defects in root and shoot tissues of plants, and severe yield reductions in many crops. Despite this agricultural importance, the underlying mechanisms of how B shapes plant developmental and morphological processes are still not unequivocally understood in detail. This review evaluates experimental approaches that address our current understanding of how B influences plant morphological processes by focusing on developmental defects observed under B deficiency. We assess what is known about mechanisms that control B homeostasis and specifically highlight: (i) limitations in the methodology that is used to induce B deficiency; (ii) differences between mutant phenotypes and normal plants grown under B deficiency; and (iii) recent research on analyzing interactions between B and phytohormones. Our analysis highlights the need for standardized methodology to evaluate the roles of B in the cell wall versus other parts of the cell.
