Previous studies suggest that abscisic acid (ABA) stimulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes under normal and chilling temperature and enhanced chilling resistance in Stylosanthes guianensis. The objective of this study was to test whether nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the ABA-induced activities of the antioxidant enzymes in Stylosanthes guianensis due to its nature as a second messenger in stress responses. Plants were treated with NO donors, ABA, ABA in combination with NO scavengers or the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor and their effects on the activity of antioxidant enzymes and NO production were compared. The results showed that ABA increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). The effect of ABA on antioxidant enzyme activities was suppressed by the NOS inhibitor, N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), and the NO scavenger, 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl3-oxide (PTIO). NO content increased after 5 h of ABA treatment. The NO-scavenger, PTIO, and the NOS-inhibitor, L-NNA, inhibited the accumulation of NO in ABA-treated Stylosanthes guianensis. NO donor treatment enhanced the activities of SOD, CAT, and APX. The results suggested that NO was involved in the ABA-induced activities of SOD, CAT, and APX in Stylosanthes guianensis. ABA triggered NO production that may lead to the stimulation of antioxidant enzyme activities.
