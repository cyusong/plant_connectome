Taxol is an efficient anticancer drug; however, the accumulation of taxoids can vary hugely among Taxus species. The mechanism underlying differential accumulation of taxoids is largely unknown. Thus, comparative analysis of the transcriptomes in three Taxus species, including T. media, T. mairei and T. cuspidata, was performed. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the diterpenoid biosynthesis and cytochrome P450 pathways were significantly enriched in different comparisons. Differential expressions of these taxol biosynthesis related genes might be a potential explanation for the interspecific differential accumulation of taxol and its derivatives. Besides, the sequences of several MEP pathway-associated genes, such as DXS, DXR, MCT, CMK, MDS, HDS, HDR, IPPI, and GGPPS, were re-assembled based on independent transcriptomes from the three Taxus species. Phylogenetic analysis of these MEP pathway-associated enzymes also showed a high sequence similarity between T. media and T. cuspidata. Moreover, 48 JA-related transcription factor (TF) genes, including 10 MYBs, 5 ERFs, 4 RAPs, 3 VTCs, and 26 other TFs, were analyzed. Differential expression of these JA-related TF genes suggested distinct responses to exogenous JA applications in the three Taxus species. Our results provide insights into the expression pattern and sequence similarity of several taxol biosynthesis-related genes in three Taxus species. The data give us an opportunity to reveal the mechanism underlying the variations in the taxoid contents and to select the highest-yielding Taxus species.
