['24009530', 'Salt stress is an important environmental factor that significantly limits crop  productivity worldwide. Studies on responses of plants to salt stress in recent  years have identified novel signaling pathways and have been at the forefront of  plant stress biology and plant biology in general. Thus far, research on salt  stress in plants has been focused on cytoplasmic signaling pathways. In this  study, we discovered a nuclear calcium-sensing and signaling pathway that is  critical for salt stress tolerance in the reference plant Arabidopsis. Through a  forward genetic screen, we found a nuclear-localized calcium-binding protein,  RSA1 (SHORT ROOT IN SALT MEDIUM 1), which is required for salt tolerance, and  identified its interacting partner, RITF1, a bHLH transcription factor. We show  that RSA1 and RITF1 regulate the transcription of several genes involved in the  detoxification of reactive oxygen species generated by salt stress and that they  also regulate the SOS1 gene that encodes a plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) antiporter  essential for salt tolerance. Together, our results suggest the existence of a  novel nuclear calcium-sensing and -signaling pathway that is important for gene  regulation and salt stress tolerance.', '2013 Aug', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1003755', 'Zhu']
