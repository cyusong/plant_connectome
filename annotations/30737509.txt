['30737509', 'Multicellular development requires coordinated cell polarization relative to body  axes, and translation to oriented cell division(1-3). In plants, it is unknown  how cell polarities are connected to organismal axes and translated to division.  Here, we identify Arabidopsis SOSEKI proteins that integrate apical-basal and  radial organismal axes to localize to polar cell edges. Localization does not  depend on tissue context, requires cell wall integrity and is defined by a  transferrable, protein-specific motif. A Domain of Unknown Function in SOSEKI  proteins resembles the DIX oligomerization domain in the animal Dishevelled  polarity regulator. The DIX-like domain self-interacts and is required for edge  localization and for influencing division orientation, together with a second  domain that defines the polar membrane domain. Our work shows that SOSEKI  proteins locally interpret global polarity cues and can influence cell division  orientation. Furthermore, this work reveals that, despite fundamental  differences, cell polarity mechanisms in plants and animals converge on a similar  protein domain.', '2019 Feb', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/s41477-019-0363-6', 'ORCID:']
