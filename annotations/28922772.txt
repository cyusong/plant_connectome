Plasmolysis of hypocotyl cells of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana diminishes the dynamics of the remodeling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the central protoplast, namely that withdrawn from the cell wall, and more persistent cisternae are formed, yet little change in the actin network in the protoplast occurs. Also, protein flow within the ER network in the protoplast, as detected with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), is not affected by plasmolysis. After plasmolysis, another network of strictly tubular ER remains attached to the plasma membrane-wall interface and is contained within the Hechtian strands and reticulum. FRAP studies indicate that protein flow within these ER tubules diminishes. Actin is largely absent from the Hechtian reticulum and the ER becomes primarily associated with altered, branched microtubules. The smaller volume of the central protoplast is accompanied by decreased movement rates of tubules, cisternae, and spheroid organelles, but this reduced movement is not readily reversed by the increase in volume that accompanies deplasmolysis.
