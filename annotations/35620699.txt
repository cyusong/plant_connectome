<i>Entada phaseoloides</i> stem is known for its high medicinal benefits and <i>ornamental</i> value. Flavonoids are one of the <i>main active constituents</i> in <i>E. phaseoloides</i> stem. However, the regulatory mechanism of flavonoids accumulation in <i>E. phaseoloides</i> is lacking. Here, phytochemical compounds and transcripts from stems at different developmental stages in <i>E. phaseoloides</i> were investigated by metabolome and transcriptome analysis. The metabolite profiling of the oldest stem was obviously different from young and older stem tissues. A total of 198 flavonoids were detected, and flavones, flavonols, anthocyanins, isoflavones, and flavanones were the main subclasses. The metabolome data showed that the content of acacetin was significantly higher in the young stem and older stem than the oldest stem. Rutin and myricitrin showed significantly higher levels in the oldest stem. A total of 143 MYBs and 143 bHLHs were identified and classified in the RNA-seq data. Meanwhile, 34 flavonoid biosynthesis structural genes were identified. Based on the expression pattern of structural genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, it indicated that flavonol, anthocyanin, and proanthocyanin biosynthesis were first active during the development of <i>E. phaseoloides</i> stem, and the anthocyanin or proanthocyanin biosynthesis branch was dominant; the flavone biosynthesis branch was active at the late developmental stage of the stem. Through the correlation analysis of transcriptome and metabolome data, the potential candidate genes related to regulating flavonoid synthesis and transport were identified. Among them, the MYBs, bHLH, and TTG1 are coregulated biosynthesis of flavonols and structural genes, bHLH and transporter genes are coregulated biosynthesis of anthocyanins. In addition, the WDR gene TTG1-like (AN11) may regulate dihydrochalcones and flavonol biosynthesis in specific combinations with IIIb bHLH and R2R3-MYB proteins. Furthermore, the transport gene protein TRANSPARENT TESTA 12-like gene is positively regulated the accumulation of rutin, and the homolog of ABC transporter B family member gene is positively correlated with the content of flavone acacetin. This study offered candidate genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, information of flavonoid composition and characteristics of flavonoids accumulation, improved our understanding of the MYBs and bHLHs-related regulation networks of flavonoid biosynthesis in <i>E. phaseoloides</i> stem, and provided references for the metabolic engineering of flavonoid biosynthesis in <i>E. phaseoloides</i> stem.
