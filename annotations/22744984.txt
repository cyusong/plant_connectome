['22744984', 'Chitin is commonly found in fungal cell walls and is one of the well-studied  microbe/pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Previous studies showed that  lysin motif (LysM)-containing proteins are essential for plant recognition of  chitin, leading to the activation of plant innate immunity. In Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana), the LYK1/CERK1 (for LysM-containing receptor-like  kinase1/chitin elicitor receptor kinase1) was shown to be essential for chitin  recognition, whereas in rice (Oryza sativa), the LysM-containing protein, CEBiP  (for chitin elicitor-binding protein), was shown to be involved in chitin  recognition. Unlike LYK1/CERK1, CEBiP lacks an intracellular kinase domain.  Arabidopsis possesses three CEBiP-like genes. Our data show that mutations in  these genes, either singly or in combination, did not compromise the response to  chitin treatment. Arabidopsis also contains five LYK genes. Analysis of mutations  in LYK2, -3, -4, or -5 showed that LYK4 is also involved in chitin signaling. The  lyk4 mutants showed reduced induction of chitin-responsive genes and diminished  chitin-induced cytosolic calcium elevation as well as enhanced susceptibility to  both the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 and the fungal  pathogen Alternaria brassicicola, although these phenotypes were not as dramatic  as that seen in the lyk1/cerk1 mutants. Similar to LYK1/CERK1, the LYK4 protein  was also localized to the plasma membrane. Therefore, LYK4 may play a role in the  chitin recognition receptor complex to assist chitin signal transduction and  plant innate immunity.', '2012 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.201699', 'Stacey']
