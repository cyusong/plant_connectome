['16595667', 'In plants, a proposed ascorbate (vitamin C) biosynthesis pathway occurs via  GDP-D-mannose (GDP-D-Man), GDP-L-galactose (GDP-L-Gal), and L-galactose. However,  the steps involved in the synthesis of L-Gal from GDP-L-Gal in planta are not  fully characterized. Here we present evidence for an in vivo role for L-Gal-1-P  phosphatase in plant ascorbate biosynthesis. We have characterized a low  ascorbate mutant (vtc4-1) of Arabidopsis thaliana, which exhibits decreased  ascorbate biosynthesis. Genetic mapping and sequencing of the VTC4 locus  identified a mutation (P92L) in a gene with predicted L-Gal-1-P phosphatase  activity (At3g02870). Pro-92 is within a beta-bulge that is conserved in related  myo-inositol monophosphatases. The mutation is predicted to disrupt the  positioning of catalytic amino acid residues within the active site. Accordingly,  L-Gal-1-P phosphatase activity in vtc4-1 was approximately 50% of wild-type  plants. In addition, vtc4-1 plants incorporate significantly more radiolabel from  [2-(3)H]Man into L-galactosyl residues suggesting that the mutation increases the  availability of GDP-L-Gal for polysaccharide synthesis. Finally, a homozygous  T-DNA insertion line, which lacks a functional At3g02870 gene product, is also  ascorbate-deficient (50% of wild type) and deficient in L-Gal-1-P phosphatase  activity. Genetic complementation tests revealed that the insertion mutant and  VTC4-1 are alleles of the same genetic locus. The significantly lower ascorbate  and perturbed L-Gal metabolism in vtc4-1 and the T-DNA insertion mutant indicate  that L-Gal-1-P phosphatase plays a role in plant ascorbate biosynthesis. The  presence of ascorbate in the T-DNA insertion mutant suggests there is a bypass to  this enzyme or that other pathways also contribute to ascorbate biosynthesis.', '2006 Jun 9', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M601409200', 'Smirnoff']
