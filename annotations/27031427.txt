['27031427', "Biochemical, genetic, physiological, and molecular research in plants has  demonstrated a central role of glucose (Glc) in the control of plant growth,  metabolism, and development, and has revealed networks that integrate light,  stresses, nutrients, and hormone signaling. Previous studies have reported that  AtPGR protein as potential candidates for Glc signaling protein. In the present  study, we characterized transcription factors that bind to the upstream region of  the AtPGR gene isolated using the yeast one-hybrid screening with an Arabidopsis  cDNA library. One of the selected genes (AtSTKL) appeared to confer elevated  sensitivity to Glc response. Overexpression of AtSTKLs (AtSTKL1 and AtSTKL2)  increased the sensitivity to Glc during the post-germination stages. In contrast,  atstkl1 and atstkl2 antisense lines displayed reduced sensitivity to high Glc  concentration during the early seedling stage. Furthermore, we showed that the  two AtSTKLs bind to the 5'-GCCT-3' element of the upstream promoter region of the  AtPGR gene in vitro and repress the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in AtPGR  promoter-GUS (P999-GUS) transgenic plants. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged  AtSTKLs were localized in the nuclei of transgenic Arabidopsis cells.  Collectively, these results suggest that AtSTKL1 and AtSTKL2 function both as  repressors of AtPGR transcription and as novel transcription factors in the Glc  signaling pathway.", '2016 Jul', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.03.029', 'Kim']
