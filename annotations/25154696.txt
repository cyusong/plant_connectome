['25154696', 'The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) controls many aspects of plant growth and  development, including seed development, germination and responses to  water-deficit stress. A complex ABA signaling network integrates environmental  signals including water availability and light intensity and quality to fine-tune  the response to a changing environment. To further define the regulatory pathways  that control water-deficit and ABA responses, we carried out a gene-trap tagging  screen for water-deficit-regulated genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. This screen  identified PLASTID MOVEMENT IMPAIRED1 (PMI1), a gene involved in  blue-light-induced chloroplast movement, as functioning in ABA-response pathways.  We provide evidence that PMI1 is involved in the regulation of seed germination  by ABA, acting upstream of the intersection between ABA and low-glucose signaling  pathways. Furthermore, PMI1 participates in the regulation of ABA accumulation  during periods of water deficit at the seedling stage. The combined phenotypes of  pmi1 mutants in chloroplast movement and ABA responses indicate that ABA  signaling may modulate chloroplast motility. This result was further supported by  the detection of altered chloroplast movements in the ABA mutants aba1-6, aba2-1  and abi1-1.', '2014 Oct', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.07.014', 'Springer']
