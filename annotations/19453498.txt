Different defense mechanisms of three spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties were studied by withholding watering in well-watered pots to gradually increase water deficit of plants grown in containers. The strategies of plant adaptation were divided into three phases according to the severity of drought: first, a positive defense phase that started from commencement of non-hydraulic root-sourced signals (nHRS) and ended at onset of hydraulic root-sourced signals (HRS)--the plant responded to imminent drought by decreasing stomatal aperture to lessen water loss and no membrane injury occurred. The second defense phase occurred between the onset of HRS and temporary wilting (TW), characterized by enhancement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), marked enzyme activity and increased MDA content. Mild lipid membrane peroxidation came mainly from a dynamic imbalance between free radical production and enzymatic defense reaction, which indicated that injury by ROS had not been completely repaired by increasing enzymatic activity. The third defense phase was from TW to permanent wilting (PW), the synthesis of SOD and CAT during TW could not deal with the collapse of antioxidant enzymes, and SOD and CAT activities began to decrease, which caused the excessive ROS production and thus serious membrane lipid peroxidation. The defense strategies to drought are similar among the varieties, but modern varieties LC8275 and GY602 bred after 1975 had relatively higher defense levels at all three defense phases, which suggest that modern varieties are more resistant than old ones, and artificial selection would lead to a different direction in evolution from natural selection.
