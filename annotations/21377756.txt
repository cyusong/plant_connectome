Jasmonates (JAs) are the well characterized fatty acid-derived cyclopentanone signals involved in the plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses. JAs have been shown to regulate many aspects of plant metabolism, including glucosinolate biosynthesis. Glucosinolates are natural plant products that function in defense against herbivores and pathogens. In this study, we applied a proteomic approach to gain insight into the physiological processes, including glucosinolate metabolism, in response to methyl jasmonate (MeJA). We identified 194 differentially expressed protein spots that contained proteins that participated in a wide range of physiological processes. Functional classification analysis showed that photosynthesis and carbohydrate anabolism were repressed after MeJA treatment, while carbohydrate catabolism was up-regulated. Additionally, proteins related to the JA biosynthesis pathway, stress and defense, and secondary metabolism were up-regulated. Among the differentially expressed proteins, many were involved in oxidative tolerance. The results indicate that MeJA elicited a defense response at the proteome level through a mechanism of redirecting growth-related metabolism to defense-related metabolism.
