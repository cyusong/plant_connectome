['22380942', 'The Spo0B-associated GTP-binding protein (Obg) GTPase, essential for bacterial  viability, is also conserved in eukaryotes, but its primary role in eukaryotes  remains unknown. Here, our functional characterization of Arabidopsis and rice  obgc mutants strongly underlines the evolutionarily conserved role of eukaryotic  Obgs in organellar ribosome biogenesis. The mutants exhibited a chlorotic  phenotype, caused by retarded chloroplast development. A plastid DNA macroarray  revealed a plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) deficiency in an obgc mutant,  caused by incompleteness of the PEP complex, as its western blot exhibited  reduced levels of RpoA protein, a component of PEP. Plastid rRNA profiling  indicated that plastid rRNA processing is defective in obgc mutants, probably  resulting in impaired ribosome biogenesis and, in turn, in reduced levels of RpoA  protein. RNA co-immunoprecipitation revealed that ObgC specifically  co-precipitates with 23S rRNA in vivo. These findings indicate that ObgC  functions primarily in plastid ribosome biogenesis during chloroplast  development. Furthermore, complementation analysis can provide new insights into  the functional modes of three ObgC domains, including the Obg fold, G domain and  OCT.', '2012 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04976.x', 'Bahk']
