Grapevine species (Vitis sp.) are prone to several diseases, fungi being the major pathogens compromising its cultivation and economic profit around the world. Knowledge of the complexity of mechanisms responsible for resistance to fungus infection of cultivars, such as Regent, is necessary for strategies to be defined which will improve resistance in highly susceptible crop species. Transcript and metabolic profiles of the Vitis vinifera cultivars Regent and Trincadeira (resistant and susceptible to fungi, respectively) were analysed by cDNA microarray, quantitative real-time PCR, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The integration of datasets obtained through transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed differences in transcripts and metabolites between both cultivars. These differences are probably associated with the innate resistance of Regent towards the mildews. Several transcripts related to stress and defence, namely a subtilisin-like protease, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, WD-repeat protein like, and J2P, were up-regulated in Regent suggesting an intrinsic resistance capability of this cultivar. A metabolic profile revealed an accumulation of compounds such as inositol and caffeic acid, which are known to confer resistance to fungi. The differences in transcripts and metabolites detected are discussed in terms of the metabolic pathways and their possible role in plant defence against pathogen attack, as well as their potential interest to discriminate among resistant and susceptible grapevine cultivars.
