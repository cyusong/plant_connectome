Fusarium wilt caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>vasinfectum</i> race 4 (FOV4) is an early season disease causing root rot, seedling wilt, and death. To develop an appropriate field evaluation method for resistance to FOV4 in cotton breeding, the objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of cultivar, planting date, and inoculum density on disease progression in 2020-2021. Results showed that the usual local mid-April planting had the lowest disease severity (DSR) or mortality rate (MR) in 2020 and 2021. DSR or MR increased at the late April and early May plantings in both years and reached the highest at the early May planting in 2020, while MR in 2021 was followed by a decrease in the late May planting and reached the highest in the mid-June planting. Local daily low temperatures between mid-April and mid-June were favorable for FOV4 infections, whereas daily high temperatures at 35°C or higher suppressed wilt severity. When seedlings at the 2-true leaf stage were inoculated with 10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>, and 10<sup>7</sup> conidia ml<sup>-1</sup> per plant in 2020, DSR was low but a linear relationship between inoculum density and DSR was observed. When a FOV4-infested soil supplemented with artificial inoculation was used, disease progression in three moderately susceptible or moderately resistant cultivars followed a linear model, while it followed a quadratic model in the highly susceptible Pima S-7 cultivar only. Among the other three cultivars, FM 2334GLT had the lowest DSR or MR except for one planting date in both years, followed by PHY 725 RF and Pima PHY 881 RF in ascending order, which were consistent with the difference in regression coefficients of the linear models. This study demonstrates that disease progression curves due to FOV4 can be used to compare responses to FOV4 infections among cotton genotypes in cotton breeding and genetic studies, regardless of planting date and inoculation method.
