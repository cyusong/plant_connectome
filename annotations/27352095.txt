Plant isoprene emissions have been linked to several reaction pathways involved in atmospheric photochemistry. Evidence exists from a limited set of past observations that isoprene emission rate (I<sub>s</sub> ) decreases as a function of increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and that increased temperature suppresses the CO<sub>2</sub> effect. We studied interactions between intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (C<sub>i</sub> ) and temperature as they affect I<sub>s</sub> in field-grown hybrid poplar trees in one of the warmest climates on earth - the Sonoran Desert of the southwestern United States. We observed an unexpected midsummer downregulation of I<sub>s</sub> despite the persistence of relatively high temperatures. High temperature suppression of the I<sub>s</sub> :C<sub>i</sub> relation occurred at all times during the growing season, but sensitivity of I<sub>s</sub> to increased C<sub>i</sub> was greatest during the midsummer period when I<sub>s</sub> was lowest. We interpret the seasonal downregulation of I<sub>s</sub> and increased sensitivity of I<sub>s</sub> to C<sub>i</sub> as being caused by weather changes associated with the onset of a regional monsoon system. Our observations on the temperature suppression of the I<sub>s</sub> :C<sub>i</sub> relation are best explained by the existence of a small pool of chloroplastic inorganic phosphate, balanced by several large, connected metabolic fluxes, which together, determine the C<sub>i</sub> and temperature dependencies of phosphoenolpyruvate import into the chloroplast.
