• Allopolyploidy, a driving force in plant evolution, can induce rapid structural changes in parental subgenomes. Here, we examined the fate of homologous subtelomeric satellites in intrasection allotetraploid Nicotiana arentsii formed from N. undulata and N. wigandioides progenitors < 200,000 yr ago. • We cloned and sequenced a number of monomers from progenitors and the allotetraploid. Structural features of both cloned and genomic monomers were studied using double-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. • Two homologous satellites were isolated from N. undulata (called NUNSSP) and N. wigandioides (NWISSP). While the NUNSSP monomers were highly homogeneous in nucleotide sequences, the NWISSP monomers formed two separate clades. Likewise, the genomic NUNSSP monomers showed less DNA conformation heterogeneity than NWISSP monomers, with distinct conformations. While both satellites predominantly occupy subtelomeric positions, a fraction of the NWISSP repeats was found in an intercalary location, supporting the hypothesis that dispersion prevents the repeats becoming homogeneous. Sequence, structural and chromosomal features of the parental satellites were faithfully inherited by N. arentsii. • Our study revealed that intergenomic homogenization of subtelomeric satellite repeats does not occur in N. arentsii allotetraploid. We propose that the sequence and structural divergence of subtelomeric satellites may render allopolyploid chromosomes less vulnerable to intergenomic exchanges.
