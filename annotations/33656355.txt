The Tn<i>7</i>-based genomic integration system enables direct insertion of foreign gene elements into the chromosome downstream of <i>glms</i> in many bacteria species. The <i>glms</i> gene is greatly conserved in <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> species complex (RSSC), while its downstream regions are mostly different in the RSSC. Here, we provided genetic evidence to validate that this Tn<i>7</i> integration is dependent on a conserved 30-bp motif in the <i>glms</i>, called an <i>att</i>Tn<i>7</i> box, and artificial <i>att</i>Tn<i>7</i> boxes elsewhere are competent for the Tn<i>7</i> integration, which is further confirmed to be simultaneous downstream of both original and artificial <i>att</i>Tn<i>7</i> boxes, using PCR. With the whole-genome resequencing on 500 Tn<i>7</i>-colonies, the Tn<i>7</i> integration was confirmed to be site- specific at 25 bp downstream of <i>glms</i> with monocopy as a chromosome of the RSSC. Characteristic of a monocopy in a chromosome enables the Tn<i>7</i>-based complementation to fully restore phenotypes of mutants to those of parent strains that are advantageous rather than those based on plasmids with low-copy numbers. The Tn<i>7</i>-based genomic integration system provides a generally applicable and versatile genetic tool for studies of complementation, pathogenesis, overexpression, and in-vivo promoter activity assays with monocopy in the RSSC.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
