Aquatic photosynthetic organisms induce a CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism (CCM) to overcome the difficulty of acquiring inorganic carbon under CO<sub>2</sub>-limiting conditions. As part of the CCM, the CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing enzyme Rubisco is enriched in the pyrenoid located in the chloroplast, and, in many green algae, several thick starch plates surround the pyrenoid to form a starch sheath. In <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, low-CO<sub>2</sub>-inducible protein B (LCIB), which is an essential factor for the CCM, displays altered cellular localization in response to a decrease in environmental CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, moving from dispersed throughout the chloroplast stroma to around the pyrenoid. However, the mechanism behind LCIB migration remains poorly understood. Here, we report the characteristics of an <i>Isoamylase1</i>-less mutant (4-D1), which shows aberrant LCIB localization and starch sheath formation. Under very-low-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, 4-D1 showed retarded growth, lower photosynthetic affinities against inorganic carbon, and a decreased accumulation level of the HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> transporter HLA3. The aberrant localization of LCIB was also observed in another starch-sheathless mutant <i>sta11</i>-<i>1</i>, but not in <i>sta2</i>-<i>1</i>, which possesses a thinned starch sheath. These results suggest that the starch sheath around the pyrenoid is required for the correct localization of LCIB and for the operation of CCM.
