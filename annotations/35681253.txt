Recent investigations in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that SUPPRESSOR of MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 1 (SMAX1) and SMAX1-LIKE2 (SMXL2) are negative regulators of karrikin (KAR) and strigolactone (SL) signaling during plant growth and development, but their functions in drought resistance and related mechanisms of action remain unclear. To understand the roles and mechanisms of SMAX1 and SMXL2 in drought resistance, we investigated the drought-resistance phenotypes and transcriptome profiles of smax1 smxl2 (s1,2) double-mutant plants in response to drought stress. The s1,2 mutant plants showed enhanced drought-resistance and lower leaf water loss when compared with wild-type (WT) plants. Transcriptome comparison of rosette leaves from the s1,2 mutant and the WT under normal and dehydration conditions suggested that the mechanism related to cuticle formation was involved in drought resistance. This possibility was supported by enhanced cuticle formation in the rosette leaves of the s1,2 mutant. We also found that the s1,2 mutant plants were more sensitive to abscisic acid in assays of stomatal closure, cotyledon opening, chlorophyll degradation and growth inhibition, and they showed a higher reactive oxygen species detoxification capacity than WT plants. In addition, the s1,2 mutant plants had longer root hairs and a higher root-to-shoot ratio than the WT plants, suggesting that the mutant had a greater capacity for water absorption than the WT. Taken together, our results indicate that SMAX1 and SMXL2 negatively regulate drought resistance, and disruption of these KAR- and SL-signaling-related genes may therefore provide a novel means for improving crop drought resistance.
