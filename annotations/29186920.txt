['29186920', 'The physiological function of Arabidopsis thaliana universal stress protein  (AtUSP) in plant has remained unclear. Thus, we report here the functional role  of the Arabidopsis universal stress protein, AtUSP (At3g53990). To determine how  AtUSP affects physiological responses towards cold stress, AtUSP overexpression  (AtUSP OE) and T-DNA insertion knock-out (atusp, SALK_146059) mutant lines were  used. The results indicated that AtUSP OE enhanced plant tolerance to cold  stress, whereas atusp did not. AtUSP is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm,  and cold stress significantly affects RNA metabolism such as by misfolding and  secondary structure changes of RNA. Therefore, we investigated the relationship  of AtUSP with RNA metabolism. We found that AtUSP can bind nucleic acids,  including single- and double-stranded DNA and luciferase mRNA. AtUSP also  displayed strong nucleic acid-melting activity. We expressed AtUSP in RL211  Escherichia coli, which contains a hairpin-loop RNA structure upstream of  chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), and observed that AtUSP exhibited  anti-termination activity that enabled CAT gene expression. AtUSP expression in  the cold-sensitive Escherichia coli (E. coli) mutant BX04 complemented the cold  sensitivity of the mutant cells. As these properties are typical characteristics  of RNA chaperones, we conclude that AtUSP functions as a RNA chaperone under  cold-shock conditions. Thus, the enhanced tolerance of AtUSP OE lines to cold  stress is mediated by the RNA chaperone function of AtUSP.', '2017 Nov 27', 'Int J Mol Sci', '10.3390/ijms18122546', 'Lee']
