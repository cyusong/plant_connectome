Many organisms, including bacteria, fungi, animal, plants and algae, utilize blue light to adapt to a fluctuating light environment. Plants and algae, and photosynthetic stramenopiles in particular, require light energy for photosynthesis and have thus evolved a range of sophisticated light-sensing systems to utilize light information efficiently for growth, development and physiological responses. LOV (light, oxygen or voltage) domain photoreceptors are widely distributed among prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and the number of specific LOV photoreceptors are increased in certain taxa. In this review, we summarize the molecular basis and physiological functions of three different families of LOV blue light receptors specific to green plants and photosynthetic stramenopiles: phototropin, ZEITLUPE/FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1/LOV KELCH PROTEIN 2 (ZTL/FKF1/LKP2) and aureochrome.

aureochrome: !senses! blue light 
light: !utilized by! plants 
light: !utilized by! photosynthetic stramenopiles 
light: !required for! photosynthesis 
LOV domain photoreceptors: !distributed among! prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms
