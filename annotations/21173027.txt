Leaf senescence, as the last stage of leaf development, is regulated by diverse developmental and environmental factors. Jasmonates (JAs) have been shown to induce leaf senescence in several plant species; however, the molecular mechanism for JA-induced leaf senescence remains unknown. In this study, proteomic, genetic, and physiological approaches were used to reveal the molecular basis of JA-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We identified 35 coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1)-dependent JA-regulated proteins using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis in Arabidopsis. Among these 35 proteins, Rubisco activase (RCA) was a COI1-dependent JA-repressed protein. We found that RCA was down-regulated at the levels of transcript and protein abundance by JA in a COI1-dependent manner. We further found that loss of RCA led to typical senescence-associated features and that the COI1-dependent JA repression of RCA played an important role in JA-induced leaf senescence.
