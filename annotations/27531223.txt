Land plants exhibit a degree of homeostasis in leaf water content to protect against damage to photosynthetic and xylem tissues, and to maintain an efficient allocation of resources. This is achieved by a strong coordination between the systems regulating water delivery (xylem) and water loss (stomata). This review discusses evolution in xylem and stomatal function, specifically focussing on the interactions between them.
