The low-phosphate-tolerant maize mutant Qi319-96 was obtained from Qi319 through cellular engineering. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the low-phosphate tolerance of this mutant, we performed comparative proteome analyses of the leaves of Qi319-96 and Qi319 under inorganic phosphate (Pi)-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions. Low-phosphorus levels limit plant growth and metabolism. Although the overall phosphorus contents of shoots were not significantly different between Qi319 and Qi319-96, the Pi level of Qi319-96 was 52.94 % higher than that of Qi319. Under low phosphorus conditions, Qi319-96 had increased chlorophyll levels and enhanced photosynthesis. The changes in starch and sucrose contents under these conditions also differed between genotypes. The proteomic changes included 29 (Pi-sufficient) and 71 (Pi-deficient) differentially expressed proteins involved in numerous metabolic processes. Proteome and physiological analyses revealed that Qi319-96 could better remodel the lipid composition of membranes and had higher V-ATPase activity levels than Qi319 under low-phosphate starvation, which enhanced the recycling of intracellular Pi, as reflected by its increased Pi levels. Chlorophyll biosynthesis was improved and the levels, and activities, of several Calvin cycle and "CO2 pump" enzymes were greater in Qi319-96 than in Qi319, which led to a higher rate of photosynthesis under low-phosphate stress in this line compared with in Qi319. Our results suggest that the increased tolerance of the maize mutant Qi319-96 to low-phosphate levels is owing to its ability to increase Pi availability. Additionally, inbred lines of maize with low-P-tolerant traits could be obtained effectively through cellular engineering.
