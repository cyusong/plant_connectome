Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to trigger signaling pathways that interact with other signaling pathways mediated by nitric oxide, lipid messengers, and plant hormones. In a previous study, we demonstrated that ethylene was involved in hypoxia signaling to regulate the expression of downstream genes such as AtERF73/HRE1 and ADH1. Furthermore, H 2O 2 and ethylene interplay has an effect on AtERF73/HRE1 and ADH1 expression during the early stages of hypoxia signaling. Here, we propose a model for the main transcription factor AtERF73/HRE1, which is controlled by 3 pathways during hypoxia. These include an ethylene-dependent pathway, an ethylene-independent/H 2O 2-dependent pathway, and an ethylene and H 2O 2-independent pathway involved in hypoxia signaling to modulate AtERF73/HRE1.
