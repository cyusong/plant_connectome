As compared with other eukaryotic cells, plants have developed an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi interface with very specific structural characteristics. ER to Golgi and Golgi to ER transport appear not to be dependent on the cytoskeleton, and ER export sites have been found closely associated with Golgi bodies to constitute entire mobile units. However, the molecular machinery involved in membrane trafficking seems to be relatively conserved among eukaryotes. Therefore, a challenge for plant scientists is to determine how these molecular machineries work in a different structural and dynamic organization. This review will focus on some aspects of membrane dynamics that involve coat proteins, SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor proteins), lipids, and lipid-interacting proteins.
