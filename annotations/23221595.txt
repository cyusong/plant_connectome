['23221595', 'To gain insights into the molecular details of photosystem I (PSI) biogenesis, we  characterized the PsbP-domain protein1 (ppd1) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana that  specifically lacks PSI activity. Deletion of PPD1 results in an inability of the  mutant to grow photoautotrophically and a specific loss of the stable PSI  complex. Unaltered transcription and translation of plastid-encoded PSI genes  indicate that PPD1 acts at the posttranslational level. In vivo protein labeling  experiments reveal that the rate of synthesis of PSI reaction center proteins  PsaA/B in ppd1 is comparable to that of wild-type plants, whereas the rate of  turnover of PsaA/B proteins is higher in ppd1 than in wild-type plants. With  increasing leaf age, PPD1 content decreases considerably, while PSI content  remains constant. PPD1 is a nuclear-encoded thylakoid lumenal protein and is  associated with PSI but is not an integral subunit of PSI. Biochemical and  molecular analyses reveal that PPD1 interacts directly and specifically with PsaB  and PsaA. Yeast two-hybrid experiments show that PPD1 interacts with some lumenal  loops of PsaB and PsaA. Our results suggest that PPD1 is a PSI assembly factor  that assists the proper folding and integration of PsaB and PsaA into the  thylakoid membrane.', '2012 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.106542', 'Lu']
