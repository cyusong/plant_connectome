['9090883', 'Determinate growth of floral meristems in Arabidopsis requires the function of  the floral regulatory gene AGAMOUS (AG). Expression of AG mRNA in the central  region of floral meristems relies on the partially overlapping functions of the  LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) genes, which promote initial floral meristem  identity. Here, we provide evidence that AG function is required for the final  definition of floral meristem identity and that constitutive AG function can  promote, independent of LFY and AP1 functions, the determinate floral state in  the center of reproductive meristems. Loss-of-function analysis showed that the  indeterminate central region of the ag mutant floral meristem undergoes  conversion to an inflorescence meristem when long-day-dependent flowering  stimulus is removed. Furthermore, gain-of-function analysis demonstrated that  ectopic AG function results in precocious flowering and the formation of terminal  flowers at apices of both the primary inflorescence and axillary branches of  transgenic Arabidopsis plants in which AG expression is under the control of the  35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus. Similar phenotypes were also observed  in lfy ap1 double mutants carrying a 35S-AG transgene. Together, these results  indicate that AG is a principal developmental switch that controls the transition  of meristem activity from indeterminate to determinate.', '1997 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.9.3.393', 'Ma']
