['19818620', "Our understanding of the evolution of organismal diversity is restricted by the  current resolution of the genotype-phenotype map. In particular, the genetic  basis of environmentally relevant phenotypic variation among natural populations  remains poorly understood. Trichomes are single-cell outgrowths on the surface of  plant leaves and other above-ground organs. Consistent with trichomes' suggested  function to protect plants from predators and abiotic stressors [1-3], trichome  density is strikingly variable among natural populations (e.g., [2, 4]). Despite  substantial progress in the genetic dissection of trichome development [5], how  trichome number is modulated in natural populations remains enigmatic. Here, we  show that the ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC 2 (ETC2) from the single-repeat R3 MYB  family is the major locus determining trichome patterning in natural Arabidopsis  populations. Our study identifies a single amino acid substitution in ETC2 (K19E)  as the causal quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN). We suggest that this amino  acid replacement might affect the stability of the ETC2 repressor, which results  in a reduced trichome number. This is consistent with the view that morphology  can evolve by coding changes that can subtly modulate protein activity as well as  cis-regulatory changes that alter expression patterns.", '2009 Nov 3', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.057', 'Hauser']
