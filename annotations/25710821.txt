During host-pathogen interactions, pattern recognition receptors form complexes with proteins, such as receptor-like kinases, to elicit pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), an evolutionarily conserved plant defense program. However, little is known about the components of the receptor complex, as are the molecular events leading to PTI induced by the oomycete Phytophthora pathogen. Here, we demonstrate that tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) SlSOBIR1 and SlSOBIR1-like genes are involved in defense responses to Phytophthora parasitica. Silencing of SlSOBIR1 and SlSOBIR1-like enhanced susceptibility to P. parasitica in tomato. Callose deposition, reactive oxygen species production, and PTI marker gene expression were compromised in SlSOBIR1- and SlSOBIR1-like-silenced plants. Interestingly, P. parasitica infection and elicitin (ParA1) treatment induced the relocalization of SlSOBIR1 from the plasma membrane to endosomal compartments and silencing of NbSOBIR1 compromised ParA1-mediated cell death on Nicotiana benthamiana. Moreover, the SlSOBIR1 kinase domain is indispensable for ParA1 to trigger SlSOBIR1 internalization and plant cell death. Taken together, these results support the idea of participation of solanaceous SOBIR1/EVR homologs in the perception of elicitins and indicate their important roles in plant basal defense against oomycete pathogens.
