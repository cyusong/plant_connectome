Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are the second largest family of transcription factors (TFs) involved in developmental and physiological processes in plants. In this study, 205 putative bHLH TF genes were identified in the genome of Artemisia annua and expression of 122 of these was determined from transcriptomes used to construct the genetic map of A. annua. Analysis of gene expression association allowed division of the 122 bHLH TFs into five groups. Group V, containing 15 members, was tightly associated with artemisinin biosynthesis genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that two bHLH TFs, AabHLH106 and AabHLH112, were clustered with Arabidopsis ICE proteins. AabHLH112 was induced by low temperature, while AabHLH106 was not. We therefore chose AabHLH112 for further examination. AabHLH112 was highly expressed in glandular secretory trichomes, flower buds, and leaves. Dual-luciferase assays demonstrated that AabHLH112 enhanced the promoter activity of artemisinin biosynthesis genes and AaERF1, an AP2/ERF TF that directly and positively regulates artemisinin biosynthesis genes. Yeast one-hybrid assays indicated that AabHLH112 could bind to the AaERF1 promoter, but not to the promoters of artemisinin biosynthesis genes. Overexpression of AabHLH112 significantly up-regulated the expression levels of AaERF1 and artemisinin biosynthesis genes and consequently promoted artemisinin production.
