We have previously reported that Al-induces citrate and malate efflux from P-sufficient and P-deficient plants of rape (Brassica napus L.) and that P-deficiency alone could not induce this response. Further investigation showed that the transcript of two genes designated BnALMT1 and BnALMT2 is accumulated in roots by Al-treatment. Transgenic tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum) and Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the BnALMT1 and BnALMT2 proteins released more malate than control cells in the presence of Al, indicating that the BnALMT genes encode an Al-activated malate transporter. The transgenic tobacco cells exposed to toxic level of Al grew better than control cells indicating that the genes can enhance Al-resistance of plant cells. In this study we showed the subcellular localization of BnALMT1 fused to the green fluoresce protein (GFP). The BnALMT1:: GFP construct was transiently expressed in protoplasts prepared from Arabidopsis leaves using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) method. The result showed that the BnALMT1 protein is localized in the plasma membrane. This provides further evidence that the BnALMT proteins facilitate the transport of malate across the plasma membrane (PM).
