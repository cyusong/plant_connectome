Plant responses against pathogens are influenced by growth immunity tradeoff, which ensure the best use of limited resources. We study how the immobilization of carbon resources and the induction of defensive responses (glucosinolates, phenolic compounds, stomatal closure) can influence the biomass of two Brassica oleracea lines, differing in their resistance, after infection with Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. Potentially, the growth immunity tradeoff can be influenced by the activation of all these processes. However, on the contrary of which is normally stated, our results suggest that the loss of biomass caused by pathogen infection is mainly due to the differential accumulation of starch and the immobilization of sugars rather than the reallocation of resources to synthesize secondary metabolites. Moreover, resistance may be related to the effectiveness of the tradeoff, since the resistant line immobilizes resources more efficiently than the susceptible one. Both inbred lines show a different phytohormones profile, which support the hypothesis that they are employing different strategies to defend themselves against the pathogen. This study emphasizes the key role of the primary metabolism in the defence strategies of plants against pathogens.
