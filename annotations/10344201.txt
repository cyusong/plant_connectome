['10344201', 'Sequence comparison with the mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MVD) amino  acid sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified an EST clone corresponding  to a cDNA that may encode Arabidopsis thaliana MVD (AtMVD1). This enzyme  catalyses the synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate, the building block of sterol  and isoprenoid biosynthesis, and uses mevalonate diphosphate as a substrate.  Sequencing of the full-length cDNA was performed. The predicted amino acid  sequence presents about 55% identity with the yeast, human and rat MVDs. The  sequence of the genomic region of A. thaliana MVD was also obtained and Southern  blot analysis on genomic DNA showed that A. thaliana could have at least one  homologous MVD gene. In order to allow heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae,  the MVD open reading frame (ORF) was then cloned under the control of the yeast  PMA1 strong promoter. When expressed in yeast, the A. thaliana cDNA complemented  both the thermosensitive MN19-34 strain deficient in MVD, and the lethal  phenotype of an ERG19 deleted strain. However, the wild-type sterol content was  not fully restored suggesting that the A. thaliana MVD activity may not be  optimal in yeast. A two-hybrid assay was also performed to evaluate homodimer  formation of the A. thaliana MVD and heterodimer formation between the plant and  yeast heterologous enzymes.', '1999 Mar', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1023/a:1006181720100', 'Berges']
