The generation of mature RNAs, i.e. mRNAs, rRNAs or tRNAs, is a complex process in all genetic systems. RNA-internal processes such as splicing or RNA editing, but also posttranscriptional processes modulating 5' and 3' termini of transcripts, contribute to RNA maturation. In this article, we focus on the posttranscriptional formation of 5' termini of mitochondrial RNAs in seed plants, with particular emphasis on the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). We will summarize the progress made in recent studies of proteins involved in this process. In addition, we will evaluate whether 5' processing proceeds endo- or exo-nucleolytically. Despite the considerable progress made, many details of this process remain unsolved. In particular, it is still unclear why there is frequent 5' processing of many mRNAs although impaired processing does not interfere with mitochondrial function and plant fitness. Thus, the importance of 5' processing for plant mitochondria is still puzzling.
