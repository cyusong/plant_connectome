The transition from anhydrobiotic to hydrated state occurs during early imbibition of seeds and is lethal if lipid reserves in seeds are crystalline. Low temperatures crystallize lipids during seed storage. We examine the nature of cellular damage observed in seeds of Cuphea wrightii and C. lanceolata that differ in triacylglycerol composition and phase behavior. Intracellular structure, observed using transmission electron microscopy, is profoundly and irreversibly perturbed if seeds with crystalline triacylglycerols are imbibed briefly. A brief heat treatment that melts triacylglycerols before imbibition prevents the loss of cell integrity; however, residual effects of cold treatments in C. wrightii cells are reflected by the apparent coalescence of protein and oil bodies. The timing and temperature dependence of cellular changes suggest that damage arises via a physical mechanism, perhaps as a result of shifts in hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions when triacylglycerols undergo phase changes. Stabilizers of oil body structure such as oleosins that rely on a balance of physical forces may become ineffective when triacylglycerols crystallize. Recent observations linking poor oil body stability and poor seed storage behavior are potentially explained by the phase behavior of the storage lipids. These findings directly impact the feasibility of preserving genetic resources from some tropical and subtropical species.
