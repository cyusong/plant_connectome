['17360436', 'We present evidence that heterotrimeric G protein signaling is involved in cell  death associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR) in Arabidopsis.  Seedlings of homozygous agb1-2 (Gbeta-null mutation) mutant plants are markedly  more resistant to growth inhibition by the protein glycosylation inhibitor  tunicamycin (Tm) than either wild-type plants or gpa1-4 (Galpha-null mutation)  mutants. Leaves of older Gbeta mutant plants show much less cell death when  infiltrated with Tm than leaves of wild-type plants. The transcriptional response  of Gbeta mutant plants to Tm is less pronounced than that of wild-type plants, as  is the accumulation of BiP chaperone proteins. A majority of the Arabidopsis  Gbeta protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and  cofractionates with membrane-associated ER luminal BiP. Consistent with its ER  localization, Gbeta protein is degraded during the UPR, whereas Galpha protein is  not. Taken together, these observations imply that the Gbeta protein, which forms  a stable heterodimer with the Ggamma subunit, is involved in the signaling events  that trigger UPR-associated cell death. The different Tm sensitivities of Galpha  and Gbeta mutants, the ER localization of Gbeta, and the differential stabilities  of Galpha and Gbeta proteins during the UPR suggest that the Gbetagamma complex  serves a signaling function in the ER independent of its function in the  Galphabetagamma heterotrimer.', '2007 Mar 6', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0611735104', 'Fedoroff']
