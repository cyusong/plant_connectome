The effects of bulk and Nanosized SiO<sub>2</sub> on seed germination and seedling growth indices of fenugreek under salinity stress were studied in the College of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, in 2013. The experimental treatments included 4 levels of salinity stress (0, 50, 100 and 150 mM), 2 concentrations of bulk (50 and 100 ppm), 2 concentrations of nanosized SiO<sub>2</sub> (50 and 100 ppm), and control (without any SiO<sub>2</sub> types). Seedling growth attributes significantly improved when bulk and nanosized SiO<sub>2</sub> concentrations applied singly or with different levels of salt stress. However, they significantly declined with salt application. The adverse effects of salt on shoot, root and seedling lengths were alleviated by application of 50 ppm nanosized SiO<sub>2</sub> treatment. Under salt stress condition, addition of 50 and 100 ppm nanosized SiO<sub>2</sub> to fenugreek seeds increased shoot, root and seedling dry weights as compared to bulk SiO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and control treatments, though 50 ppm nanosized SiO<sub>2</sub> was more effective than 100 ppm nanosized SiO<sub>2</sub> application. It was concluded that nanosized SiO<sub>2</sub> improves growth attributes of fenugreek and mitigate adverse effects of salt stress.
