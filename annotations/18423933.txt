This paper presents the results of the interaction of red light (R) with blue light (B), applied to shoots of M9 apple (Malus pumila paradisiaca Schmid) rootstock, on the regulation of stem growth, apical dominance and branching. These results are compared with the active form of phytochromes (PHYs) under monochromatic and dichromatic light treatments. The inhibition of internode elongation was determined by PHY photoequilibrium, with the additional effect of B, by means of a separate photoreceptor. The development of phytomers appeared to be primarily due to the active form of PHY, with a marginal effect from B. Shoot growth, which combines internode elongation and development of the phytomer, was highest under R and lowest under B and far red light (FR), showing the largely positive role of PHY photoequilibrium. Under FR, reduced stem elongation was due to the very small number of phytomers formed. Apical dominance was inhibited, while branching was increased under R, corresponding to the highest values of PHY photoequilibrium determined. Apical dominance was increased and branching was reduced by B, indicating a complex interaction between PHY and B receptor. In the shoot cluster system, photomorphogenic behavior was dependent on the time of exposure to the different light qualities. The information gained from the study will be helpful in improving the set up of in vitro growth light conditions, and in providing useful insights into research of the development of the woody plant canopy, an important factor in ecological plant communities.
