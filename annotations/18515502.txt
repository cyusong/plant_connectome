['18515502', 'Numerous, varied, and widespread taxa have an internal circadian clock that  allows anticipation of rhythmic changes in the environment. We have identified  XAP5 CIRCADIAN TIMEKEEPER (XCT), an Arabidopsis thaliana gene important for light  regulation of the circadian clock and photomorphogenesis. XCT is essential for  proper clock function: xct mutants display a shortened circadian period in all  conditions tested. Interestingly, XCT plays opposite roles in plant responses to  light depending both on trait and wavelength. The clock in xct plants is  hypersensitive to red but shows normal responses to blue light. By contrast,  inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in xct is hyposensitive to red light but  hypersensitive to blue light. Finally, XCT is important for  ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase production and plant greening in  response to light. This novel combination of phenotypes suggests XCT may play a  global role in coordinating growth in response to the light environment. XCT  contains a XAP5 domain and is well conserved across diverse taxa, suggesting it  has a common function in higher eukaryotes. Downregulation of the XCT ortholog in  Caenorhabditis elegans is lethal, suggesting that studies in Arabidopsis may be  instrumental to understanding the biochemical activity of XCT.', '2008 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.056655', 'Harmer']
