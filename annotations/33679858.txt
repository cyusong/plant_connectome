Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) is caused by a consortium of mutually interacting Fusarium species. In the field, the weakly pathogenic <i>F. poae</i> often thrives on the infection sites of the virulent <i>F. graminearum</i>. In this ecological context, we investigated the efficacy of chemical and biocontrol agents against <i>F. graminearum</i> in wheat ears. For this purpose, one fungicide comprising prothioconazole + spiroxamine and two bacterial biocontrol strains, <i>Streptomyces rimosus</i> LMG 19352 and <i>Rhodococcus</i> sp. R-43120 were tested for their efficacy to reduce FHB symptoms and mycotoxin (deoxynivalenol, DON) production by <i>F. graminearum</i> in presence or absence of <i>F. poae</i>. Results showed that the fungicide and both actinobacterial strains reduced FHB symptoms and concomitant DON levels in wheat ears inoculated with <i>F. graminearum</i>. Where <i>Streptomyces rimosus</i> appeared to have direct antagonistic effects, <i>Rhodococcus</i> and the fungicide mediated suppression of <i>F. graminearum</i> was linked to the archetypal salicylic acid and jasmonic acid defense pathways that involve the activation of <i>LOX1</i>, <i>LOX2</i> and <i>ICS</i>. Remarkably, this chemical- and biocontrol efficacy was significantly reduced when <i>F. poae</i> was co-inoculated with <i>F. graminearum</i>. This reduced efficacy was linked to a suppression of the plant's intrinsic defense system and increased levels of DON. In conclusion, our study shows that control strategies against the virulent <i>F. graminearum</i> in the disease complex causing FHB are hampered by the presence of the weakly pathogenic <i>F. poae</i>. This study provides generic insights in the complexity of control strategies against plant diseases caused by multiple pathogens.
