['18069941', 'Trichothecenes are a closely related family of phytotoxins that are produced by  phytopathogenic fungi. In Arabidopsis, expression of AtNFXL1, a homologue of the  putative human transcription repressor NF-X1, was significantly induced by  application of type A trichothecenes, such as T-2 toxin. An atnfxl1 mutant  growing on medium lacking trichothecenes showed no phenotype, whereas a  hypersensitivity phenotype was observed in T-2 toxin-treated atnfxl1 mutant  plants. Microarray analysis indicated that several defense-related genes (i.e.  WRKYs, NBS-LRRs, EDS5, ICS1, etc.) were upregulated in T-2 toxin-treated atnfxl1  mutants compared with wild-type plants. In addition, enhanced salicylic acid (SA)  accumulation was observed in T-2 toxin-treated atnfxl1 mutants, which suggests  that AtNFXL1 functions as a negative regulator of these defense-related genes via  an SA-dependent signaling pathway. We also found that expression of AtNFXL1 was  induced by SA and flg22 treatment. Moreover, the atnfxl1 mutant was less  susceptible to a compatible phytopathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain  DC3000 (Pst DC3000). Taken together, these results indicate that AtNFXL1 plays an  important role in the trichothecene response, as well as the general defense  response in Arabidopsis.', '2008 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03353.x', 'Nishiuchi']
