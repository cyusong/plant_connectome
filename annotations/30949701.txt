Nitrate and phosphate ions are major sources of nitrogen and phosphorus for plants. In addition to their vital roles as indispensable macronutrients, these ions function as signalling molecules and induce a variety of responses. Plants adapt to different levels of nutrients by altering their gene expression profile and subsequent physiological and morphological responses. Advances made in recent years have provided novel insights into plant nutrient sensing and modulation of gene expression. Key breakthroughs include elucidation of the mechanisms underlying post-translational regulation of NIN-LIKE PROTEIN (NLP) and PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE (PHR) family transcription factors, which function as master regulators of responses to nitrate and phosphate starvation, respectively. Determination of the mechanisms whereby these nutrient signals are integrated through NIGT1/HHO family proteins has likewise represented important progress. Further studies have revealed novel roles in nutrient signalling of transcription factors that have previously been shown to be associated with other signals, such as light and phytohormones. Nitrate and phosphate signals are thus transmitted through an intricate gene regulatory network with the help of various positive and negative transcriptional regulators. These complex regulatory patterns enable plants to integrate input signals from various environmental factors and trigger appropriate responses, as exemplified by the regulatory module involving NIGT1/HHO family proteins. These mechanisms collectively support nutrient homeostasis in plants.
