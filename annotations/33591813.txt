A rare actinomycetes strain of <i>Saccharothrix texasensis</i>, strain 6-C, has been isolated from the potato rhizosphere and it was shown to act as a biological control agent to potato late blight. It is also the first report on <i>Saccharothrix</i> spp. inhibiting <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. Here, we present the complete genome data of <i>S. texasensis</i> strain 6-C, assembled by sequencing reads obtained by both PacBio and Illumina technologies with annotation. The final assembled genome length is 9,045,220 bp, without gaps and plasmid, and its GC content is 72.39%. Nine nonribosomal peptides synthetase, five type I polyketide synthase, four terpene, and three lanthipeptide gene clusters were identified in the genome, which would be likely to encode lots of antimicrobial active substances to help host plants against disease. This genome sequence could contribute to investigations of the molecular basis underlying the biocontrol activity of this <i>Saccharothrix</i> strain.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
