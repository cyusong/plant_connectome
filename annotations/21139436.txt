We recently reported that AFH14 participated in microtubule and actin filament interaction in cell division, and the AFH14 (FH1FH2) was important to the directly binding activity of microtubules and microfilaments. To preliminarily understand the function and localization of AFH14 in non-dividing cells, we overexpressed FH1FH2-RFP in onion epidermal cells, and found a fluorescence labeled filamentous network. The result of double labeling with different cytoskeleton reporter proteins indicated that FH1FH2-RFP co-localized with cortical microtubules. Treatment of cells expressing FH1FH2-RFP with cytoskeleton disrupting drugs confirms that FH1FH2-RFP binds to microtubules. Moreover, the binding of FH1FH2-RFP to microtubules were revealed to be dynamic by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiment. Time-lapse confocal microscopy showed that FH1FH2-RFP could display a dynamics similar to the microtubule dynamic instability. These data suggest that FH1FH2 domain may lead AFH14 function on cortical microtubules in non-dividing cells, and FH1FH2-RFP may be utilized as a microtubule reporter protein in living onion epidermal cells.
