['12403775', 'Deficient in DNA Methylation 1 (DDM1) protein is required to maintain the DNA  methylation status of Arabidopsis thaliana. DDM1 is a member of the broad  SWI2/SNF2 protein family. Because of its phylogenetic position, DDM1 has been  speculated to act as a chromatin-remodeling factor. Here we used a purified  recombinant DDM1 protein to investigate whether it can remodel chromatin in  vitro. We show that DDM1 is an ATPase stimulated by both naked and nucleosomal  DNA. DDM1 binds to the nucleosome and promotes chromatin remodeling in an  ATP-dependent manner. Specifically, it induces nucleosome repositioning on a  short DNA fragment. The enzymatic activity of DDM1 is not affected by DNA  methylation. The relevance of these findings to the in vivo role of DDM1 is  discussed.', '2003 Jan 10', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M209260200', 'Jerzmanowski']
