['31297122', 'The C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR signaling pathway is strictly modulated by numerous  factors and is essential in the cold response of plants. Here, we show that the  DUF793 family gene BYPASS1-LIKE modulates freezing tolerance through the CBFs in  Arabidopsis. The expression of B1L was rapidly induced under cold treatment.  Comparing to wild type, B1L knockout mutants were more sensitive to freezing  treatment, whereas B1L-overexpressing lines were more tolerant. The expression of  CBFs and CBF target genes was significantly decreased in b1l mutant. Using yeast  two-hybrid screening system, 14-3-3lambda was identified as one of proteins  interacting with B1L. The interaction was confirmed with bimolecular fluorescence  complementation assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Biochemical assays  revealed that b1l mutation promoted the degradation of CBF3 compared to wild  type, whereas 14-3-3kappalambda mutant and b1l 14-3-3kappalambda mutant suppressed the degradation  of CBF3. Consistently, 14-3-3kappalambda and b1l 14-3-3kappalambda mutants showed enhanced freezing  tolerance compared to wild type. These results indicate that B1L enhances the  freezing tolerance of plants, at least partly through stabilizing CBF. Our  findings improve our understanding of the regulation of CBF in response to cold  stress.', '2019', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2019.00807', 'An']
