In plants, microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis involves cotranscriptional processing of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-generated primary transcripts by a multi-protein complex termed the microprocessor. Here, we report that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PRE-MRNA PROCESSING PROTEIN 40 (PRP40), the U1 snRNP auxiliary protein, positively regulates the recruitment of SERRATE, a core component of the plant microprocessor, to miRNA genes. The association of DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), the microprocessor endoribonuclease, with chromatin was altered in prp40ab mutant plants. Impaired cotranscriptional microprocessor assembly was accompanied by RNAPII accumulation at miRNA genes and retention of miRNA precursors at their transcription sites in the prp40ab mutant plants. We show that cotranscriptional microprocessor assembly, regulated by AtPRP40, positively affects RNAPII transcription of miRNA genes and is important to reach the correct levels of produced miRNAs.
