Sugars are involved in many metabolic and signalling pathways in plants. Sugar signals may also contribute to immune responses against pathogens and probably function as priming molecules leading to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity in plants. These putative roles also depend greatly on coordinated relationships with hormones and the light status in an intricate network. Although evidence in favour of sugar-mediated plant immunity is accumulating, more in-depth fundamental research is required to unravel the sugar signalling pathways involved. This might pave the way for the use of biodegradable sugar-(like) compounds to counteract plant diseases as cheaper and safer alternatives for toxic agrochemicals.
