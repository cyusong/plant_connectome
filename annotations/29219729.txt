As an endophytic fungus of Sebacinales, Piriformospora indica promotes plant growth and resistance to abiotic stress, including drought. Colonization of maize roots promoted the leaf size, root length and number of tap roots. Under drought stress, the maize seedlings profited from the presence of the fungus and performed visibly better than the uncolonized controls. To identify genes and biological processes involved in growth promotion and drought tolerance conferred by P. indica, the root transcriptome of colonized and uncolonized seedlings was analyzed 0, 6 and 12 h after drought stress (20% polyethylene glycol 6000). The number of P. indica-responsive genes increased from 464 (no stress at 0 h) to 1337 (6 h drought) and 2037 (12 h drought). Gene Ontology analyses showed that the carbon and sulfur metabolisms are major targets of the fungus. Furthermore, the growth promoting effect of P. indica is reflected by higher transcript levels for microtubule associated processes. Under drought stress, the fungus improved the oxidative potential of the roots, and stimulated genes for hormone functions, including those which respond to abscisic acid, auxin, salicylic acid and cytokinins. The comparative analyses of our study provides systematic insight into the molecular mechanism how P. indica promotes plant performance under drought stress, and presents a collection of genes which are specifically targeted by the fungus under drought stress in maize roots.
