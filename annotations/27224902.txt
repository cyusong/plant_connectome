Phytohormones mainly affect plant development and trigger varied responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. The sensitivity of methods used to profile phytohormones is a vital factor that affects the results. We used an improved GC-MS-based method in the selective ion-monitoring (SIM) mode to study the phytohormone profiling in citrus tissues. One extraction solvent mixture and two derivatization reagents were used, methyl chloroformate (MCF) and N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). The method showed a low limit of detection and low limit of quantification with high extraction recovery percentage and reproducibility. Overall, we detected 13 phytohormones belonging to six different groups. Auxins, SAs, tJA, and ABA were detected after derivatization with MCF while cytokinins and GAs were detected after derivatization with MSTFA. Cytokinins, SAs, and gibberellins were found in all tissues while auxins and tJA were observed only in the leaves. ABA was found in leaves and roots, but not in root tips. The method we used is efficient, precise, and appropriate to study citrus phytohormonal profiles to understand their crosstalk and responses to environmental and biological stresses.
