Fusarium head blight (FHB) and sharp eyespot are important diseases of the cereal plants, including bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and barley. Both diseases are predominately caused by the pathogenic fungi, <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> and <i>Rhizoctonia cerealis</i>. The roles of the wheat-wall-associated kinases (WAKs) in defense against both <i>F. graminearum</i> and <i>R. cerealis</i> have remained largely unknown. This research reports the identification of <i>TaWAK2A-800</i>, a wheat <i>WAK</i>-coding gene located on chromosome 2A, and its functional roles in wheat resistance responses to FHB and sharp eyespot. <i>TaWAK2A-800</i> transcript abundance was elevated by the early infection of <i>R. cerealis</i> and <i>F. graminearum</i>, or treatment with exogenous chitin. The gene transcript seemed to correspond to the resistance of wheat. Further functional analyses showed that silencing <i>TaWAK2A-800</i> compromised the resistance of wheat to both FHB (<i>F. graminearum</i>) and sharp eyespot (<i>R. cerealis</i>). Moreover, the silencing reduced the expression levels of six defense-related genes, including the chitin-triggering immune pathway-marker genes, <i>TaCERK1</i>, <i>TaRLCK1B</i>, and <i>TaMPK3</i>. Summarily, <i>TaWAK2A-800</i> participates positively in the resistance responses to both <i>F. graminearum</i> and <i>R. cerealis</i>, possibly through a chitin-induced pathway in wheat. <i>TaWAK2A-800</i> will be useful for breeding wheat varieties with resistance to both FHB and sharp eyespot.
