Stomatal movement is essential for plants to optimize transpiration and therefore photosynthesis. Rapid changes in the stomatal aperture are accompanied by adjustment of vacuole volume and morphology in guard cells (GCs). In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf epidermis, stomatal development undergoes a cell-fate transition including four stomatal lineage cells: meristemoid, guard mother cell, young GC, and GC. Little is known about the mechanism underlying vacuole dynamics and vacuole formation during stomatal development. Here, we utilized whole-cell electron tomography (ET) analysis to elucidate vacuole morphology, formation, and development in different stages of stomatal lineage cells at nanometer resolution. The whole-cell ET models demonstrated that large vacuoles were generated from small vacuole stepwise fusion/maturation along stomatal development stages. Further ET analyses verified the existence of swollen intraluminal vesicles inside distinct vacuoles at certain developmental stages of stomatal lineage cells, implying a role of multivesicular body fusion in stomatal vacuole formation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a mechanism mediating vacuole formation in Arabidopsis stomatal development and may shed light on the role of vacuoles in stomatal movement.
