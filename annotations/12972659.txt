['12972659', 'Different lines of evidence suggest that specific events during the cell cycle  may be mediated by a heterotrimeric G-protein activated by a cognate G-protein  coupled receptor. However, coupling between the only known Galpha-subunit of the  heterotrimeric G-protein (GPA1) and the only putative G-protein coupled receptor  (GCR1) of plants has never been shown. Using a variety of approaches, we show  here that GCR1-enhanced thymidine incorporation into DNA depends on an increase  in phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activity and an elevation of  inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels in the cells. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum)  cells that overexpress either Arabidopsis GCR1 or GPA1 display this phenomenon.  We suggest on the basis of these results that GCR1-controlled events during the  cell cycle involve phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C as an effector  of GCR1 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate as a second messenger, and that GCR1 and  GPA1 are both involved in this particular signaling pathway.', '2003 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.026005', 'Colucci']
