HsfB1 is a central regulator of heat stress (HS) response and functions dually as a transcriptional co-activator of HsfA1a and a general repressor in tomato. HsfB1 is efficiently synthesized during the onset of HS and rapidly removed in the course of attenuation during the recovery phase. Initial results point to a complex regime modulating HsfB1 abundance involving the molecular chaperone Hsp90. However, the molecular determinants affecting HsfB1 stability needed to be established. We provide experimental evidence that DNA-bound HsfB1 is efficiently targeted for degradation when active as a transcriptional repressor. Manipulation of the DNA-binding affinity by mutating the HsfB1 DNA-binding domain directly influences the stability of the transcription factor. During HS, HsfB1 is stabilized, probably due to co-activator complex formation with HsfA1a. The process of HsfB1 degradation involves nuclear localized Hsp90. The molecular determinants of HsfB1 turnover identified in here are so far seemingly unique. A mutational switch of the R/KLFGV repressor motif's arginine and lysine implies that the abundance of other R/KLFGV type Hsfs, if not other transcription factors as well, might be modulated by a comparable mechanism. Thus, we propose a versatile mechanism for strict abundance control of the stress-induced transcription factor HsfB1 for the recovery phase, and this mechanism constitutes a form of transcription factor removal from promoters by degradation inside the nucleus.
