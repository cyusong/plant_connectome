['20616083', 'Cellulose synthase-interactive protein 1 (CSI1) was identified in a two-hybrid  screen for proteins that interact with cellulose synthase (CESA) isoforms  involved in primary plant cell wall synthesis. CSI1 encodes a 2,150-amino acid  protein that contains 10 predicted Armadillo repeats and a C2 domain. Mutations  in CSI1 cause defective cell elongation in hypocotyls and roots and reduce  cellulose content. CSI1 is associated with CESA complexes, and csi1 mutants  affect the distribution and movement of CESA complexes in the plasma membrane.', '2010 Jul 20', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1007092107', 'Somerville']
