Phytochrome-interacting factor 1 (PIF1) inhibits light-dependent seed germination. The specific function of PIF1 in seed germination is partly due to its high level of expression in imbibed seeds, but the associated regulatory factors have not been identified. Here we show that mutation of the early flowering in short days (EFS) gene, encoding an H3K4 and H3K36 methyltransferase, decreases the level of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 but not H3K4me3 at the PIF1 locus, reduces the targeting of RNA polymerase II to the PIF1 locus, and reduces mRNA expression of PIF1 in imbibed seeds. Consistently, the efs mutant geminated even under the phyBoff condition, and had an expression profile of PIF1 target genes similar to that of the pif1 mutant. Introduction of an EFS transgene into the efs mutant restored the level of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 at the PIF1 locus, the high-level expression of PIF1 mRNA, the expression pattern of PIF1 target genes, and the light-dependent germination of these seeds. Introduction of a PIF1 transgene into the efs mutant also restored the expression pattern of PIF1 target genes and light-dependent germination in imbibed seeds, but did not restore the flowering phenotype. Taken together, our results indicate that EFS is necessary for high-level expression of PIF1 mRNA in imbibed seeds.
