Serine/threonine protein phosphatases are ubiquitous enzymes in all eukaryotes but many of their physiological roles in plants remain unknown. The available results have demonstrated critical functions for these enzymes in the regulation of adaptive stress responses, and recent studies have directed attention to the functional roles of Ser/Thr phosphatases type 2A (PP2A) as components of stress signaling pathways. This review is focused primarily on plant PP2As and their participation in the control of biotic and abiotic stress responses.
