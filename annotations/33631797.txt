Numerous proteins involved in cellulose biosynthesis and assembly have been functionally characterized. Nevertheless, we have a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of the genes that encode these proteins. Here, we report that HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS2 (HDG2), a Homeobox-Leucine Zipper IV transcription factor, regulates cellulose biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed coat mucilage. HDG2 is a transcriptional activator with the transactivation domain located within its Leucine-Zipper domain. Transcripts of HDG2 were detected specifically in seed coat epidermal cells with peak expression at 10 d postanthesis. Disruptions of HDG2 led to seed coat mucilage with aberrant morphology due to a reduction in its crystalline cellulose content. Electrophoretic mobility shift and yeast one-hybrid assays, together with chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR, provided evidence that HDG2 directly activates CELLULOSE SYNTHASE5 (CESA5) expression by binding to the L1-box cis-acting element in its promoter. Overexpression of CESA5 partially rescued the mucilage defects of hdg2-3. Together, our data suggest that HDG2 directly activates CESA5 expression and thus is a positive regulator of cellulose biosynthesis in seed coat mucilage.
