The RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway plays an essential role in the transposon silencing mechanism; the DDR complex, consisting of DRD1, DMS3, and RDM1, is an essential component of the RdDM pathway. <i>ONSEN</i>, identified in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, is a retrotransposon activated by heat stress at 37°C; however, studies on the regulation of <i>ONSEN</i> are limited. In this study, we analyzed the regulation of <i>ONSEN</i> activity by the DDR complex in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. We elucidated that loss of any component of the DDR complex increased <i>ONSEN</i> transcript levels. Transgenerational transposition of <i>ONSEN</i> was observed in the DDR-complex mutants treated with heat stress for 48 h. Furthermore, the DDR complex components DRD1, DMS3, and RDM1 played independent roles in suppressing <i>ONSEN</i> transcription and transposition. Moreover, we found that the duration of heat stress affects <i>ONSEN</i> activity. Therefore, the results of this study provide new insights into the retrotransposon regulatory mechanisms of the DDR complex in the RdDM pathway.
