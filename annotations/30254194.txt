The unfolded protein response (UPR) of the endoplasmic reticulum constitutes a conserved and essential cytoprotective pathway designed to survive biotic and abiotic stresses that alter the proteostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR is typically considered cell-autonomous and it is yet unclear whether it can also act systemically through non-cell autonomous signaling. We have addressed this question using a genetic approach coupled with micro-grafting and a suite of molecular reporters in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that the UPR has a non-cell autonomous component, and we demonstrate that this is partially mediated by the intercellular movement of the UPR transcription factor bZIP60 facilitating systemic UPR signaling. Therefore, in multicellular eukaryotes such as plants, non-cell autonomous UPR signaling relies on the systemic movement of at least a UPR transcriptional modulator.
