['17573799', 'In Arabidopsis, two floral homeotic genes APETALA2 (AP2) and AGAMOUS (AG) specify  the identities of perianth and reproductive organs, respectively, in flower  development. The two genes act antagonistically to restrict each other to their  proper domains of action within the floral meristem. In addition to AG, which  antagonizes AP2, miR172, a microRNA, serves as a negative regulator of AP2. In  this study, we showed that AG and miR172 have distinct functions in flower  development and that they largely act independently in the negative regulation of  AP2. We uncovered functions of miR172-mediated repression of AP2 in the  regulation of floral stem cells and in the delineation of the expression domain  of another class of floral homeotic genes. Given the antiquity of miR172 in land  plants, our findings have implications for the recruitment of a microRNA in the  building of a flower in evolution.', '2007 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03181.x', 'Chen']
