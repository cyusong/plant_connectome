Quality control of proteins in eukaryotic organelles is predominantly maintained by members of the ATP-dependent proteases. Even though numerous biological analyses have shed light on the functional implications of such proteases, their involvement in developmental processes of multicellular organisms has not been determined. We recently identified two <i>lon1</i> mutant alleles, both missing the carboxy terminal proteolytic domain, that show post-embryonic growth retardation resulting in delayed seedling establishment. In this addendum, we enlighten the role of Lon1 selective proteolysis in plant mitochondria biogenesis, a prerequisite for post-embryonic development and growth. In contrast to the weak <i>lon1-2</i> allele, the polypeptide encoded by the strong <i>lon1-1</i> allele carries the sensor- and substrate-discrimination domain allowing substrate recognition and binding. This type of molecular recognition hinders further degradation by the complementary Lon-independent proteolytic machineries resulting in an extra deleterious accumulation of protein aggregates into <i>lon1-1</i> mitochondria. The most challenging and informative task will be to identify the recognition motifs on the Lon protein substrates and elucidate the molecular events that control plant mitochondrial differentiation.
