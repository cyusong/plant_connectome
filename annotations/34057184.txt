Precise directional control of pollen tube growth via mechanical guidance by pistil tissue is critical for the successful fertilization of flowering plants and requires active cell-to-cell communication and maintenance of softness in the transmitting tissue. However, the regulation of transmitting tissue softness as controlled by cell wall properties, especially pectin, has not been reported. Here we report that regulation of pectin methylesterification supports pollen elongation through pistil transmitting tissues in Oryza sativa. The rice pectin methylesterase gene OsPMT10 was strongly expressed in reproductive tissues, especially the pistil. The ospmt10 mutant did not have a significant effect on vegetative growth, but the fertility rate was reduced by approximately half. In the ospmt10 mutant, pollen tube elongation was observed in the transmitting tissue of the style, but approximately half of the pollen tubes did not extend all the way to the ovule. Tissue cross-sections of the upper ovary were prepared, and immunohistochemical staining using LM19 and LM20 showed that methylesterified pectin distribution was decreased in ospmt10 compared with the wild type. The decreased expression of methylesterified pectins in ospmt10 may have resulted in loss of fluidity in the apoplast space of the transmitting tissue, rendering it difficult for the pollen tube to elongate in the transmitting tissue and thereby preventing it from reaching the ovule.
