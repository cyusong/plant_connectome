Nitrogen (N) is essential for life and is a major limiting factor of plant growth. Because soils frequently lack sufficient N, large quantities of inorganic N fertilizers are added to soils for crop production. However, nitrate, urea, and ammonium are a major source of global pollution, because much of the N that is not taken up by plants enters streams, groundwater, and lakes, where it affects algal production and causes an imbalance in aquatic food webs. Many agronomical data indicate that the higher use of N fertilizers during the green revolution had an impact on the incidence of crop diseases. In contrast, examples in which a decrease in N fertilization increases disease severity are also reported, indicating that there is a complex relationship linking N uptake and metabolism and the disease infection processes. Thus, although it is clear that N availability affects disease, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this review is to describe current knowledge of the mechanisms that link plant N status to the plant's response to pathogen infection and to the virulence and nutritional status of phytopathogens.
