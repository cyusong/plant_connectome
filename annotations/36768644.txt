Polyamine oxidases (PAOs) have been correlated with numerous physiological and developmental processes, as well as responses to biotic and abiotic stress conditions. Their transcriptional regulation is driven by signals generated by various developmental and environmental cues, including phytohormones. However, the inductive mechanism(s) of the corresponding genes remains elusive. Out of the five previously characterized Arabidopsis <i>PAO</i> genes, none of their regulatory sequences have been analyzed to date. In this study, a GUS reporter-aided promoter deletion approach was used to investigate the transcriptional regulation of <i>AtPAO3</i> during normal growth and development as well as under various inductive environments. <i>AtPAO3</i> contains an upstream open reading frame (uORF) and a short inter-cistronic sequence, while the integrity of both appears to be crucial for the proper regulation of gene expression. The full-length promoter contains several <i>cis</i>-acting elements that regulate the tissue-specific expression of <i>AtPAO3</i> during normal growth and development. Furthermore, a number of TFBS that are involved in gene induction under various abiotic stress conditions display an additive effect on gene expression. Taken together, our data indicate that the transcription of <i>AtPAO3</i> is regulated by multiple environmental factors, which probably work alongside hormonal signals and shed light on the fine-tuning mechanisms of <i>PAO</i> regulation.
