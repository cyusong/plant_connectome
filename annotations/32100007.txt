It is generally accepted that land plants evolved from streptophyte algae. However, there are also many chlorophytes (a sister group of streptophyte algae and land plants) that moved to terrestrial habitats and even resemble mosses. This raises the question of why no land plants evolved from chlorophytes. In order to better understand what enabled streptophyte algae to conquer the land, it is necessary to study the chlorophytes as well. This review will introduce the freshwater filamentous chlorophyte alga Draparnaldia sp. (Chaetophorales, Chlorophyceae) as a model for comparative analyses between these two lineages. It will also focus on current knowledge about the evolution of morphological complexity in chlorophytes versus streptophytes and their respective morphological/behavioural adaptations to semi-terrestrial habitats, and will show why Draparnaldia is needed as a new model system.
