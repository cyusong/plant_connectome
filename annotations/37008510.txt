Cotton is an important fiber crop. The cotton fiber is an extremely long trichome that develops from the epidermis of an ovule. The trichome is a general and multi-function plant organ, and <i>trichome birefringence-like</i> (<i>TBL</i>) genes are related to trichome development. At the genome-wide scale, we identified <i>TBLs</i> in four cotton species, comprising two cultivated tetraploids (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> and <i>G. barbadense</i>) and two ancestral diploids (<i>G. arboreum</i> and <i>G. raimondii</i>). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the <i>TBL</i> genes clustered into six groups. We focused on <i>GH_D02G1759</i> in group IV because it was located in a lint percentage-related quantitative trait locus. In addition, we used transcriptome profiling to characterize the role of <i>TBLs</i> in group IV in fiber development. The overexpression of <i>GH_D02G1759</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> resulted in more trichomes on the stems, thereby confirming its function in fiber development. Moreover, the potential interaction network was constructed based on the co-expression network, and it was found that <i>GH_D02G1759</i> may interact with several genes to regulate fiber development. These findings expand our knowledge of <i>TBL</i> family members and provide new insights for cotton molecular breeding.
