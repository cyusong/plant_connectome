['22274700', 'Development is often coordinated by biologically active mobile compounds that  move between cells or organs. Arabidopsis mutants with defects in the BYPASS1  (BPS1) gene overproduce an active mobile compound that moves from the root to the  shoot and inhibits growth. Here, we describe two related Arabidopsis genes, BPS2  and BPS3. Analyses of single, double and triple mutants revealed that all three  genes regulate production of the same mobile compound, the bps signal, with BPS1  having the largest role. The triple mutant had a severe embryo defect, including  the failure to properly establish provascular tissue, the shoot meristem and the  root meristem. Aberrant expression of PINFORMED1, DR5, PLETHORA1, PLETHORA2 and  WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX5 were found in heart-stage bps triple-mutant embryos.  However, auxin-induced gene expression, and localization of the PIN1 auxin efflux  transporter, were intact in bps1 mutants, suggesting that the primary target of  the bps signal is independent of auxin response. Thus, the bps signal identifies  a novel signaling pathway that regulates patterning and growth in parallel with  auxin signaling, in multiple tissues and at multiple developmental stages.', '2012 Feb', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.077313', 'Sieburth']
