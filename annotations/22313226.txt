['22313226', 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in plant cells primarily as  by-products of aerobic energy metabolism. They are also generated during plant  adaptation responses to environmental stresses, such as drought and high  salinity. Therefore, plants have evolved ROS-detoxifying enzymes and antioxidants  to cope with ROS accumulation. However, if stress conditions are prolonged, the  level of ROS will surpass the capacity of the detoxifying machinery, causing  oxidative damage to cellular constituents. It is known that ROS act in abscisic  acid-mediated stress responses to sustain plant survival under adverse growth  conditions. However, it is largely unknown how ROS metabolism is linked to stress  responses. Here, we show that a drought-responsive NAC transcription factor NTL4  promotes ROS production by binding directly to the promoters of genes encoding  ROS biosynthetic enzymes during drought-induced leaf senescence. Leaf senescence  was accelerated in 35S:4DeltaC transgenic plants over-expressing an active form of  NTL4 under drought conditions. The 35S:4DeltaC transgenic plants were hypersensitive  to drought, and ROS accumulated in the leaves. In contrast, ROS levels were  reduced in NTL4-deficient ntl4 mutants, which exhibited delayed leaf senescence  and enhanced drought resistance. These observations indicate that NTL4 acts as a  molecular switch that couples ROS metabolism to drought-induced leaf senescence  in Arabidopsis.', '2012 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04932.x', 'Park']
