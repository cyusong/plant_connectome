Strain P482 was isolated from a tomato rhizosphere and classified as <i>Pseudomonas donghuensis</i>. The <i>P. donghuensis</i> species was first established in 2015 and currently consists of only four strains: P482, HYS<sup>T</sup>, SVBP6, and 22G5. <i>P. donghuensis</i> strains antagonize plant pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes, and, therefore, are of high interest regarding their biological control potential to combat plant diseases. The antimicrobial activity of <i>P. donghuensis</i> P482 is based on the production of iron-scavenging compound 7-hydroxytropolone, antifungal volatile organic compounds, and as-yet-unidentified secondary metabolites. Here, we report a complete genome resource for <i>P. donghuensis</i> strain P482. The genome consists of a single chromosome (5,656,185 bp) with 5,258 open reading frames (5,158 protein-coding genes, 74 transfer RNAs, 22 ribosomal RNAs, 3 noncoding RNAs, and 1 transfer-messenger RNA) and no plasmid. We believe that information on the first high-quality, complete genome of <i>P. donghuensis</i> will provide resources for analyses targeting the biological control potential of this species and understanding the traits essential for plant-microbe interaction.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
