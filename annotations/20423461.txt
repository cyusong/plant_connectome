['20423461', 'Meiotic recombination is initiated by DNA double-stranded breaks introduced by  the SPO11 protein. Despite a decade of research, the biochemical functions of  SPO11 remain largely unknown, perhaps because of difficulties in studying the  functionally active SPO11. Arabidopsis thaliana encodes three SPO11-related  proteins, two of which (SPO11-1 and SPO11-2) are required for, and cooperate in,  meiosis. We isolated soluble SPO11-1, fused with or free of a trigger factor-tag  at its N terminus. The tag-free SPO11-1 needed to interact physically with  soluble SPO11-1 to maintain its solubility, suggesting a multimeric active form  including a solubilizing protein cofactor. An N-terminal fragment of PRD1, a  SPO11-1-interacting protein required for normal meiosis, but not SPO11-2, forms a  soluble complex with trigger factor-tagged SPO11-1, but the trigger factor-tag  was required for the solubility. Formation of the complex is not sufficient to  express endonuclease activity. Trigger factor-tagged SPO11-1 exhibited  DNA-binding activities: Glu substitutions of the invariant Gly215 and Arg222 and  of the nonconserved Arg223 and Arg226 in a conserved motif (G215E, R222E, R223E,  R226E) reduced the DNA-binding ability in vitro, but substitutions of the  conserved Arg130 and invariant Tyr103 (a residue in the putative  endonuclease-active center) and of Arg residues outside conserved motifs by Glu  or Phe (R130E, Y103F, R207E and R254E), did not. Tests for the ability of mutant  spo11-1 proteins to complement the silique-defective phenotype of a  spo11-1-homozygous mutant in vivo revealed that R222E and G215E induced serious  deficiencies, while R130E caused a partial defect in silique formation. Thus, the  Gly215, Arg222 and Arg223 residues of SPO11-1 form a DNA-binding surface that is  functional in meiosis.', '2010 May', 'FEBS J', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07651.x', 'Shibata']
