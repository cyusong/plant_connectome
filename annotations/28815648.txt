Seagrasses access HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> for photosynthesis by 2 mechanisms, apoplastic carbonic anhydrase-mediated dehydration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to CO<sub>2</sub> and direct HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake. Here, we have studied plasma membrane energization and the mechanism for HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> import in Posidonia oceanica. Classical electrophysiology and ion-selective microelectrodes were used to measure the membrane potential, cytosolic pH, and the cytosolic concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> upon the addition of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> . The photosynthetic response to HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and to inhibitors was also measured. Results indicate that the primary pump of P. oceanica plasma membrane is a fusicoccin-sensitive H<sup>+</sup> -ATPase. Bicarbonate depolarizes the plasma membrane voltage and transiently acidifies the cytosol, indicating that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is transported into the cells by an H<sup>+</sup> -symport. Initial cytosolic acidification is followed by an alkalinization, suggesting an internal dehydration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> . The lack of cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> responses rules out the contribution of these ions to HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport. The energetics of nH<sup>+</sup> /HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> symport allows, for n = 1, an estimate of cytosolic accumulation of 0.22 mM HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> . Because this transporter could permit accumulation of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> up to 100 times above the equilibrium concentration, it would be a significant component of a carbon-concentrating mechanism in this species.
