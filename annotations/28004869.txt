['28004869', 'Pectin is the most abundant component of primary cell walls in eudicot plants.  The modification and degradation of pectin affects multiple processes during  plant development, including cell expansion, organ initiation, and cell  separation. However, the extent to which pectin degradation by polygalacturonases  affects stem development and secondary wall formation remains unclear. Using an  activation tag screen, we identified a transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana line with  longer etiolated hypocotyls, which overexpresses a gene encoding a  polygalacturonase. We designated this gene as POLYGALACTURONASE INVOLVED IN  EXPANSION2 (PGX2), and the corresponding activation tagged line as PGX2(AT) .  PGX2 is widely expressed in young seedlings and in roots, stems, leaves, flowers,  and siliques of adult plants. PGX2-GFP localizes to the cell wall, and PGX2(AT)  plants show higher total polygalacturonase activity and smaller pectin molecular  masses than wild-type controls, supporting a function for this protein in  apoplastic pectin degradation. A heterologously expressed, truncated version of  PGX2 also displays polygalacturonase activity in vitro. Like previously  identified PGX1(AT) plants, PGX2(AT) plants have longer hypocotyls and larger  rosette leaves, but they also uniquely display early flowering, earlier stem  lignification, and lodging stems with enhanced mechanical stiffness that is  possibly due to decreased stem thickness. Together, these results indicate that  PGX2 both functions in cell expansion and influences secondary wall formation,  providing a possible link between these two developmental processes.', '2017 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13453', 'Anderson']
