Ca2+ is a ubiquitous second messenger for cellular signalling in various stresses and developmental processes. Here, we summarize current developments in the roles of Ca2+ during plant immunity responses. We discuss the early perception events preceding and necessary for triggering cellular Ca2+ fluxes, the potential Ca2+-permeable channels, the decoding of Ca2+ signals predominantly via Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation events and transcriptional reprogramming. To highlight the complexity of the cellular signal network, we briefly touch on the interplay between Ca2+-dependent signalling and selected major signalling mechanisms--with special emphasis on reactive oxygen species at local and systemic levels.
