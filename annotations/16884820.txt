The differences between two maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines and their F1 hybrids in their response to chilling periods of various duration (1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks) and subsequent return to optimum temperatures were analysed by the measurement of the photosystem (PS) 1 and 2 activity, the photosynthetic pigments' content and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The PS2 activity and the chlorophyll content decreased in plants subjected to 3 or 4 weeks of chilling, but not in those subjected to 1 or 2 weeks of chilling. This decrease was more pronounced in inbreds compared to their hybrids. The activity of superoxide dismutase did not much change with the increasing length of chilling period in the inbreds but decreased in the hybrids, the glutathione reductase activity increased in both types of genotypes but more in the inbred lines, while for ascorbate peroxidase and catalase the changes in parents-hybrids relationship did not show any specific trend. The PS1 activity and the carotenoids' content was not much affected.

PS2 activity: !decreases! with increasing length of chilling period 
chlorophyll content: !decreases! with increasing length of chilling period 
superoxide dismutase: !decreases! in hybrids 
glutathione reductase: !increases! in both types of genotypes 
ascorbate peroxidase: !no specific trend! between parents-hybrids relationship 
catalase: !no specific trend! between parents-hybrids relationship 
PS1 activity: !not much affected! by chilling period 
carotenoids' content: !not much affected! by chilling period
