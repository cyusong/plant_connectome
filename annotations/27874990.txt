Initially, exploitation of interactions between plants and other organisms, particularly insect pests, foundered because of difficulties in delivering, sustainably, the signal systems for crop protection. We now have mounting and, in some cases, clear practical evidence for successful delivery by companion cropping or next-generation genetic modification (GM). At the same time, the type of plant signalling being exploited has expanded to signalling from plants to organisms antagonistic to pests, and to plant stress-induced, or primed, plant-to-plant signalling for defence and growth stimulation.
