Root hydrotropism is a response to moisture gradients, which is considered to be important for drought avoidance. Recent reevaluation of root hydrotropism has emphasised the dominating effect of root gravitropism on it. It has been suggested that amyloplast dynamics inside columella cells and auxin regulation play roles in this interacting mechanism, even though the existence of distinct pathways of two tropisms derived from different stimuli remained unclear. We have recently found two factors that separate the mechanism of hydrotropism from that of gravitropism in Arabidopsis seedling roots. One is the difference in the mode of auxin-mediated growth regulation between two tropisms, and the other is the identification of gene indispensable only for root hydrotropism. Here we summarize the recent progress on root hydrotropism research and discuss the remaining and emerging issues.

gene: !affects! root hydrotropism
amyloplast: !mediates! auxin regulation
auxin: !regulates! growth
gene: !separates! hydrotropism from gravitropism
