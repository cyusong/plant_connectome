['18930082', 'The twin arginine translocation (Tat) machinery which is capable of transporting  folded proteins across lipid bilayers operates in the thylakoid membrane of plant  chloroplasts as well as in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. It is composed  of three integral membrane proteins (TatA, TatB, and TatC) which form heteromeric  complexes of high molecular weight that accomplish binding and transport of  substrates carrying Tat pathway-specific signal peptides. Western analyses using  affinity purified antibodies showed in both, juvenile and adult tissue from  Arabidopsis thaliana, an approximately equimolar ratio of the TatB and TatC  components, whereas TatA was detectable only in minor amounts. Upon Blue  Native-PAGE, TatB and TatC were found in four heteromeric TatB/C complexes  possessing molecular weights of approximately 310, 370, 560 and 620 kDa,  respectively, while TatA was detected only in a molecular weight range below 200  kDa. The implications of these findings on the currently existing models  explaining the mechanism of Tat transport are discussed.', '2009 Feb', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.09.006', 'Klosgen']
