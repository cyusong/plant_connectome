The photoperiodic induction of flowering is a systemic process requiring translocation of a floral stimulus from the leaves to the shoot apical meristem. In response to this stimulus, the apical meristem stops producing leaves to initiate floral development; this switch in morphogenesis involves a change in the identity of the primordia initiated and in phyllotaxis. The physiological study of the floral transition has led to the identification of several putative floral signals such as sucrose, cytokinins, gibberellins, and reduced N-compounds that are translocated in the phloem sap from leaves to the shoot apical meristem. On the other hand, the genetic approach developed more recently in Arabidopsis thaliana allowed the discovery of many genes that control flowering time. These genes function in 'cascades' within four promotive pathways, the 'photoperiodic', 'autonomous', 'vernalization', and 'gibberellin' pathways, which all converge on the 'integrator' genes SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Recently, several studies have highlighted a role for a product of FT as a component of the floral stimulus or 'florigen'. These recent advances and the proposed mode of action of FT are discussed here.
