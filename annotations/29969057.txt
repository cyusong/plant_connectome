The Plasmodiophorida (Phytomyxea, Rhizaria) are a group of protists that infect plants. Of this group, Spongospora subterranea causes major problems for the potato industry by causing powdery scab and root galling of potatoes and as vector for the Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) (genus Pomovirus, family Virgaviridae). A single tuber isolate (SSUBK13) of this uncultivable protist was used to generate DNA for Illumina sequencing. The data were assembled to a draft genome of 28.08 Mb consisting of 2,340 contigs and an L50 of 280. A total of 10,778 genes were predicted and 93% of the BUSCO genes were detected. The presented genome assembly is only the second genome of a plasmodiophorid. The data will accelerate functional genomics to study poorly understood interaction of plasmodiophorids and their hosts.
