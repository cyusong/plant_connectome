This research aimed to assess the feasibility of utilizing Raman spectroscopy in plant breeding programs. For this purpose, the evaluation of the mutant populations set up the application of 4 mM NaN<sub>3</sub> to the somatic embryos obtained from mature wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L. Adana-99 cv.) embryos. Advanced wheat mutant lines, which were brought up to the seventh generation with salt stress tolerance by following <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> environments constructed by mutated populations, were evaluated using conventional techniques [measurement of antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, and POX), total chlorophyll, TBARS, and proline contents; measurement of the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions; and evaluation of gene expression by qPCR (<i>Ta</i>HKT2;1, <i>Ta</i>HKT1;5, <i>Ta</i>SOS1, <i>Ta</i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> vacuolar antiporter, <i>Ta</i>V-PPase, <i>Ta</i>V-ATPase, and <i>Ta</i>P5CS)] and Raman spectroscopy. In this research, no significant difference was found in the increase of SOD, CAT, and POX antioxidant enzyme activities between the salt-treated and untreated experimental groups of the commercial cultivar, while there was a statistically significant increase in salt-treated advanced generation mutant lines as compared to control and the salt-treated commercial cultivar. Proline showed a statistically significant increase in all experimental groups compared to the untreated commercial cultivar. The degradation in the amount of chlorophyll was lower in the salt-treated advanced generation mutant lines than in the salt-treated commercial cultivar. According to gene expression studies, there were statistical differences at various levels in terms of Na<sup>+</sup> and/or K<sup>+</sup> uptake from soil to plant (T<i>a</i>HKT2;1, <i>Ta</i>HKT1;5, and <i>Ta</i>SOS1), and Na<sup>+</sup> compartmentalizes into the cell vacuole (<i>Ta</i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> vacuolar antiporter, <i>Ta</i> vacuolar pyrophosphatase, and <i>Ta</i> vacuola<i>r</i> H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase). The expression activity of <i>Ta</i>P5CS, which is responsible for the transcription of proline, is similar to the content of proline in the current study. As a result of Raman spectroscopy, the differences in peaks represent the protein-related bands in mutant lines having a general decreasing trend in intensity when compared to the commercial cultivar. Amide-I (1,630 and 1,668 cm<sup>-1</sup>), Histidine, Lysine, Arginine, and Leucine bands (823, 849, 1,241, 1,443, and 1,582 cm<sup>-1</sup>) showed decreasing wavenumbers. Beta-carotene peaks at 1,153 and 1,519 cm<sup>-1</sup> showed increasing trends when the normalized Raman intensities of the mutant lines were compared.
