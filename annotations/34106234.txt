Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) berries are extremely sensitive to infection by the biotrophic pathogen Erysiphe necator, causing powdery mildew disease with deleterious effects on grape and wine quality. The combined analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome associated with this common fungal infection has not been previously carried out in any fruit. In order to identify the molecular, hormonal, and metabolic mechanisms associated with infection, healthy and naturally infected V. vinifera cv. Carignan berries were collected at two developmental stages: late green (EL33) and early véraison (EL35). RNA sequencing combined with GC-electron impact ionization time-of-flight MS, GC-electron impact ionization/quadrupole MS, and LC-tandem MS analyses revealed that powdery mildew-susceptible grape berries were able to activate defensive mechanisms with the involvement of salicylic acid and jasmonates and to accumulate defense-associated metabolites (e.g. phenylpropanoids, fatty acids). The defensive strategies also indicated organ-specific responses, namely the activation of fatty acid biosynthesis. However, defense responses were not enough to restrict fungal growth. The fungal metabolic program during infection involves secretion of effectors related to effector-triggered susceptibility, carbohydrate-active enzymes and activation of sugar, fatty acid, and nitrogen uptake, and could be under epigenetic regulation. This study also identified potential metabolic biomarkers such as gallic, eicosanoic, and docosanoic acids and resveratrol, which can be used to monitor early stages of infection.
