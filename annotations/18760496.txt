Callose or beta-1,3-glucan performs multiple functions during male and female gametophyte development. Callose is synthesized by 12 members of the glucan synthase-like (GSL) gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana. To elucidate the biological roles of Arabidopsis GSL family members during sexual development, we initiated a reverse genetic approach with T-DNA insertional mutagenesis lines. We screened T-DNA insertion lines for all members of the GSL gene family and detected homozygous mutant seedlings for all members except GSL10. Three independent alleles in GSL10, gsl10-1, gsl10-3 and gsl10-4 showed distorted segregation (1:1:0) of T-DNA inserts rather than Mendelian segregation (1:2:1). By genetic analysis through reciprocal cross, we determined that gsl10 pollen could not be transmitted to descendent. The mutant pollen of GSL10/gsl10 plants at tetrad and microspore stages were not different from that of wild type, suggesting that GSL10 is not essential for normal microspore growth. Analysis of GSL10/gsl10 hemizygous pollen during development revealed abnormal function in asymmetric microspore division. gsl10 mutant microspores failed to enter into mitosis. Unlike the previously described functions of GSL1, GSL2 and GSL5, GSL10 involves an independent process of pollen development at the mitotic division stage.
