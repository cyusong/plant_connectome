['21455028', 'Plant cytokinesis occurs by the growth of cell plates from the interior to the  periphery of the cell. These dynamic events in cytokinesis are mediated by a  plant-specific microtubule (MT) array called the phragmoplast, which consists of  bundled antiparallel MTs between the two daughter nuclei. The NACK-PQR pathway, a  NACK1 kinesin-like protein and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade,  is a key regulator of plant cytokinesis through the regulation of phragmoplast  MTs. The MT-associated protein MAP65 has been identified as one of the structural  components of MT assays involved in cell division, and we recently showed that  Arabidopsis AtMAP65-3/PLEIADE (PLE) is a substrate of MPK4 that is a component of  the NACK-PQR pathway in Arabidopsis. Here we show that AtMAP65-1 and AtMAP65-2  are also phosphorylated by MPK4. AtMAP65-1 and AtMAP65-2 that localize to the  phragmoplast were phosphorylated by MPK4 in vitro. Although mutants of the  Arabidopsis AtMAP65-1 and AtMAP65-2 genes exhibited a wild-type phenotype, double  mutations of AtMAP65-3 and AtMAP65-1 or AtMAP65-2 caused more severe growth and  cytokinetic defects than the single atmap65-3/ple mutation. These results suggest  that AtMAP65-1 and AtMAP65-2 also function in cytokinesis downstream of MPK4. ', '2011 May', 'Plant Signal Behav', '10.4161/psb.6.5.15146', 'Machida']
