['11080276', 'The Arabidopsis COP1 protein functions as a developmental regulator, in part by  repressing photomorphogenesis in darkness. Using complementation of a cop1  loss-of-function allele with transgenes expressing fusions of cop1 mutant  proteins and beta-glucuronidase, it was confirmed that COP1 consists of two  modules, an amino terminal module conferring a basal function during development  and a carboxyl terminal module conferring repression of photomorphogenesis. The  amino-terminal zinc-binding domain of COP1 was indispensable for COP1 function.  In contrast, the debilitating effects of site-directed mutations in the single  nuclear localization signal of COP1 were partially compensated by high-level  transgene expression. The carboxyl-terminal module of COP1, though unable to  substantially ameliorate a cop1 loss-of-function allele on its own, was  sufficient for conferring a light-quality-dependent hyperetiolation phenotype in  the presence of wild-type COP1. Moreover, partial COP1 activity could be  reconstituted in vivo from two non-covalently linked, complementary polypeptides  that represent the two functional modules of COP1. Evidence is presented for  efficient association of the two sub-fragments of the split COP1 protein in  Arabidopsis and in a yeast two-hybrid assay.', '2000 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.124.3.979', 'von']
