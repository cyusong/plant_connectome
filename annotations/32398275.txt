It has been just over a decade since the release of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population. The NAM population has been and continues to be an invaluable resource for the maize genetics community and has yielded insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits. The parental lines have become some of the most well-characterized maize germplasm, and their de novo assemblies were recently made publicly available. As we enter an exciting new stage in maize genomics, this retrospective will summarize the design and intentions behind the NAM population; its application, the discoveries it has enabled, and its influence in other systems; and use the past decade of hindsight to consider whether and how it will remain useful in a new age of genomics.
