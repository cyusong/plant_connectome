The transition from an aquatic ancestral condition to a terrestrial environment exposed the first land plants to the desiccating effects of air and potentially large fluctuations in temperature and light intensity. To be successful, this transition necessitated metabolic, physiological, and morphological modifications, among which one of the most important was the capacity to synthesize hydrophobic extracellular biopolymers such as those found in the cuticular membrane, suberin, lignin, and sporopollenin, which collectively reduce the loss of water, provide barriers to pathogens, protect against harmful levels of UV radiation, and rigidify targeted cell walls. Here, we review phylogenetic and molecular data from extant members of the green plant clade (Chlorobionta) and show that the capacity to synthesize the monomeric precursors of all four biopolymers is ancestral and extends in some cases to unicellular plants (e.g. Chlamydomonas). We also review evidence from extant algae, bryophytes, and early-divergent tracheophytes and show that gene duplication, subsequent neo-functionalization, and the co-option of fundamental and ancestral metabolic pathways contributed to the early evolutionary success of the land plants.
