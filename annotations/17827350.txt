['17827350', 'Cotranslational and posttranslational modifications are increasingly recognized  as important in the regulation of numerous essential cellular functions.  N-myristoylation is a lipid modification ensuring the proper function and  intracellular trafficking of proteins involved in many signaling pathways.  Arabidopsis thaliana, like human, has two tightly regulated  N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) genes, NMT1 and NMT2. Characterization of knockout  mutants showed that NMT1 was strictly required for plant viability, whereas NMT2  accelerated flowering. NMT1 impairment induced extremely severe defects in the  shoot apical meristem during embryonic development, causing growth arrest after  germination. A transgenic plant line with an inducible NMT1 gene demonstrated  that NMT1 expression had further effects at later stages. NMT2 did not compensate  for NMT1 in the nmt1-1 mutant, but NMT2 overexpression resulted in shoot and root  meristem abnormalities. Various data from complementation experiments in the  nmt1-1 background, using either yeast or human NMTs, demonstrated a functional  link between the developmental arrest of nmt1-1 mutants and the myristoylation  state of an extremely small set of protein targets. We show here that protein  N-myristoylation is systematically associated with shoot meristem development and  that SnRK1 (for SNF1-related kinase) is one of its essential primary targets.', '2007 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.051870', 'Meinnel']
