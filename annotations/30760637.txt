Chloroplast biogenesis is indispensable for proper plant development and environmental acclimation. In a screen for mutants affected in photosynthesis, we identified the <i>protein phosphatase7</i>-<i>like</i> (<i>pp7l</i>) mutant, which displayed delayed chloroplast development in cotyledons and young leaves. PP7L, PP7, and PP7-long constitute a subfamily of phosphoprotein phosphatases. PP7 is thought to transduce a blue-light signal perceived by crys and phy <i>a</i> that induces expression of SIGMA FACTOR5 (SIG5). We observed that, like PP7, PP7L was predominantly localized to the nucleus in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and the <i>pp7l</i> phenotype was similar to that of the <i>sig6</i> mutant. However, <i>SIG6</i> expression was unaltered in <i>pp7l</i> mutants. Instead, loss of PP7L compromised translation and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation in chloroplasts, pointing to a distinct mechanism influencing chloroplast development. Promoters of genes deregulated in <i>pp7l</i>-<i>1</i> were enriched in PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF)-binding motifs and the transcriptome of <i>pp7l</i>-<i>1</i> resembled those of <i>pif</i> and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS1 (COP1) signalosome complex (<i>csn</i>) mutants. However, <i>pif</i> and <i>csn</i> mutants, as well as <i>cop1</i>, <i>cryptochromes (cry)1 cry2</i>, and <i>phytochromes (phy)A phyB</i> mutants, do not share the <i>pp7l</i> photosynthesis phenotype. PhyB protein levels were elevated in <i>pp7l</i> mutants, but phyB overexpression plants did not resemble <i>pp7l</i> These results indicate that PP7L operates through a different pathway and that the control of greening and photosystem biogenesis can be separated. The lack of PP7L increased susceptibility to salt and high-light stress, whereas PP7L overexpression conferred resistance to high-light stress. Strikingly, PP7L was specifically recruited to Brassicales for the regulation of chloroplast development. This study adds another player involved in chloroplast biogenesis.
