Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important symbionts for the majority of terrestrial vascular plants, yet the drivers of the compositional variation in AMF communities need to be better understood. What effects does the ontogenetic stage of host plants have and do these effects differ between plant functional groups? Are the AMF communities modified by the properties of surrounding vegetation, such as the proportion of different functional groups or nonmycorrhizal plants ? We addressed these questions in a temperate grassland and studied AMF communities using next-generation sequencing and light microscopy, evaluating their composition, taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity, functional traits and root colonization levels. We found important differences between AMF communities and their diversity between seedlings and adults which are larger than the differences among host species or between functional groups. The proportion of nonmycorrhizal plants in the surrounding affected AMF community composition and increased its richness. Our results highlight the need for further investigating the existence of a common mycelial networks. The decision to use seedlings for experimental work can affect the results more than the chosen host species.

Host plant: !affects! AMF community
AMF community: !modified by! surrounding vegetation
Seedlings: !larger differences than! host species/functional groups
Nonmycorrhizal plants: !increases! AMF richness
Experimental work: !affects! results more than host species
