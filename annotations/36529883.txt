Successful host colonization by plant pathogens requires the circumvention of host defense responses, frequently through sequence modifications in secreted pathogen proteins known as avirulence factors (Avrs). Although Avr sequences are often polymorphic, the contribution of these polymorphisms to virulence diversity in natural pathogen populations remains largely unexplored. We used molecular genetic tools to determine how natural sequence polymorphisms of the avirulence factor Avr3D1 in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici contributed to adaptive changes in virulence. We showed that there is a continuous distribution in the magnitude of resistance triggered by different Avr3D1 isoforms and demonstrated that natural variation in an Avr gene can lead to a quantitative resistance phenotype. We further showed that homologues of Avr3D1 in two nonpathogenic sister species of Z. tritici are recognized by some wheat cultivars, suggesting that Avr-R gene-for-gene interactions can contribute to nonhost resistance. We suggest that the mechanisms underlying host range, qualitative resistance, and quantitative resistance are not exclusive.
