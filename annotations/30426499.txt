The SPORULATION 11 (SPO11) proteins are among eukaryotic the topoisomerase VIA (Topo VIA) homologs involved in modulating various important biological processes, such as growth, development and stress response via endoreduplication in plants, but the underlying mechanism response to stress remains largely unknown under salt treatment. Here, we attempted to characterize a homolog of TOP VIA in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), designated as GhSPO11-3. The silencing of GhSPO11-3 in cotton plants resulted in a dwarf phenotype with a failure of cell endoreduplication and a phase shift in the ploidy levels. The GhSPO11-3-silenced plants also showed substantial changes including accumulated malondialdehyde, significantly reduced chlorophyll and proline contents and decreased antioxidative enzyme activity after salt treatment. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing GhSPO11-3 accelerated both leaf and root growth with cell expansion and endopolyploidy. Both leaf stomatal density and aperture were markedly decreased, and the transgenic Arabidopsis lines were more tolerant with expression of stress-responsive genes under salinity stress. Furthermore, consistent with the reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS), the expression of ROS scavenging-related genes was largely reinforced, and antioxidant enzyme activities were accordingly significantly enhanced in transgenic Arabidopsis lines under salt stress. In general, these results indicated that GhSPO11-3 likely respond to salt stress by positively regulating root growth, stomatal response, ROS production and the expression of stress-related genes to cope with adverse conditions in plants.
