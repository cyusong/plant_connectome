Reich et al. report that the whole-plant respiration rate, R, in seedlings scales linearly with plant mass, M, so that R=C(R)M(theta) when theta approximately 1, in which c(R) is the scaling normalization and theta is the scaling exponent. They also state that because nitrogen concentration (N) is correlated with c(R), variation in N is a better predictor of R than M would be. Reich et al. and Hedin incorrectly claim that these "universal" findings question the central tenet of metabolic scaling theory, which they interpret as predicting theta = (3/4), irrespective of the size of the plant. Here we show that these conclusions misrepresent metabolic scaling theory and that their results are actually consistent with this theory.

Reich et al.: !report! scaling of respiration rate with plant mass
N: !correlates with! c(R)
Reich et al. and Hedin: !incorrectly claim! universal findings question metabolic scaling theory
Metabolic scaling theory: !predicts! theta = (3/4)
We: !show! Reich et al.'s results are consistent with metabolic scaling theory
