Detailed knowledge about plant chemical constituents and their distributions from organ level to sub-cellular level is of critical interest to basic and applied sciences. Spectral imaging techniques offer unparalleled advantages in that regard. The core advantage of these technologies is that they acquire spatially distributed semi-quantitative information of high specificity towards chemical constituents of plants. This forms invaluable asset in the studies on plant biochemical and structural features. In certain applications, non-invasive analysis is possible. The information harvested through spectral imaging can be used for exploration of plant biochemistry, physiology, metabolism, classification, and phenotyping among others, with significant gains for basic and applied research. This article aims to present a general perspective about vibrational spectral imaging/micro-spectroscopy in the context of plant research. Within the scope of this review are infrared (IR), near-infrared (NIR) and Raman imaging techniques. To better expose the potential and limitations of these techniques, fluorescence imaging is briefly overviewed as a method relatively less flexible but particularly powerful for the investigation of photosynthesis. Included is a brief introduction to the physical, instrumental, and data-analytical background essential for the applications of imaging techniques. The applications are discussed on the basis of recent literature.
