Human selection on wild populations mostly favored a common set of plant traits during domestication. This process of direct selection also altered other independent traits that were not directly perceived or desired during crop domestication and improvement. A deeper knowledge of the inadvertent and undesirable phenotypic effects and their underlying genetic causes can help design strategies to mitigate their effects and improve genetic gain in crop plants. We review different factors explaining the negative consequences of plant domestication at the phenotypic and genomic levels. We further describe the genetic causes of undesirable effects that originate from the selection of favorable alleles during plant domestication. In addition, we propose strategies that could be useful in attenuating such effects for crop improvement. With novel -omics and genome-editing tools, it is relatively approachable to understand and manipulate the genetic and biochemical mechanisms responsible for the undesirable phenotypes in domesticated plants.
