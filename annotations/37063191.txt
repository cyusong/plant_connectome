In wheat, major yield losses are caused by a variety of diseases including rusts, spike diseases, leaf spot and root diseases. The genetics of resistance against all these diseases have been studied in great detail and utilized for breeding resistant cultivars. The resistance against leaf spot diseases caused by each individual necrotroph/hemi-biotroph involves a complex system involving resistance (R) genes, sensitivity (S) genes, small secreted protein (SSP) genes and quantitative resistance loci (QRLs). This review deals with resistance for the following four-leaf spot diseases: (i) Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB) caused by <i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i>; (ii) Tan spot (TS) caused by <i>Pyrenophora tritici</i>-<i>repentis</i>; (iii) Spot blotch (SB) caused by <i>Bipolaris sorokiniana</i> and (iv) Septoria tritici blotch (STB) caused by <i>Zymoseptoria tritici</i>.
