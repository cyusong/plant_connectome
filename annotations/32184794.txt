The heat shock transcription factor (Hsf) family, an important member in plant stress response, affects cadmium (Cd) tolerance in plants. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized a transcript of the Hsf A4 subgroup from <i>Sedum alfredii</i>. Designated as <i>SaHsfA4c</i>, the open reading frame was 1,302 bp long and encoded a putative protein of 433 amino acids containing a complete DNA-binding domain (DBD). Heterologous expression of <i>SaHsfA4c</i> in yeast enhanced Cd stress tolerance and accumulation, whereas expression of the alternatively spliced transcript <i>InSaHsfA4c</i> which contained an intron and harbored an incomplete DBD, resulted in relatively poor Cd stress tolerance and low Cd accumulation in transgenic yeast. The function of <i>SaHsfA4c</i> under Cd stress was characterized in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> and non-hyperaccumulation ecotype <i>S. alfredii</i>. <i>SaHsfA4c</i> was able to rescue the Cd sensitivity of the <i>Arabidopsis athsfa4c</i> mutant. <i>SaHsfA4c</i> reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and increased the expression of ROS-scavenging enzyme genes and <i>Hsps</i> in transgenic lines. The present results suggest that <i>SaHsfA4c</i> increases plant resistance to stress by up-regulating the activities of ROS-scavenging enzyme and the expression of <i>Hsps</i>.
