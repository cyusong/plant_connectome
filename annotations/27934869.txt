['27934869', 'Transposons are generally kept silent by epigenetic mechanisms including DNA  methylation. Here, we identified a pair of Harbinger transposon-derived proteins  (HDPs), HDP1 and HDP2, as anti-silencing factors in Arabidopsis. hdp1 and hdp2  mutants displayed an enhanced silencing of transgenes and some transposons.  Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HDP1 and HDP2 were co-domesticated from the  Harbinger transposon-encoded transposase and DNA-binding protein, respectively.  HDP1 interacts with HDP2 in the nucleus, analogous to their transposon  counterparts. Moreover, HDP1 and HDP2 are associated with IDM1, IDM2, IDM3 and  MBD7 that constitute a histone acetyltransferase complex functioning in DNA  demethylation. HDP2 and the methyl-DNA-binding protein MBD7 share a large set of  common genomic binding sites, indicating that they jointly determine the target  specificity of the histone acetyltransferase complex. Thus, our data revealed  that HDP1 and HDP2 constitute a functional module that has been recruited to a  histone acetyltransferase complex to prevent DNA hypermethylation and epigenetic  silencing.', '2017 Feb', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2016.147', 'Zhu']
