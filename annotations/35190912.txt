Some salt stress response mechanisms can translate into sorghum forage yield and thus act as targets for genetic improvement. Sorghum is a drought-tolerant cereal that is widely grown in the vast Africa's arid and semi-arid areas. Apart from drought, salinity is a major abiotic factor that, in addition to natural causes, has been exacerbated by increased poor anthropological activities. The importance of sorghum as a forage crop in saline areas has yet to be fully realized. Despite intraspecific variation in salt tolerance, sorghum is generally moderately salt-tolerant, and its productivity in saline soils can be remarkably limited. This is due to the difficulty of replicating optimal field saline conditions due to the great heterogeneity of salt distribution in the soil. As a promising fodder crop for saline areas, classic phenotype-based selection methods can be integrated with modern -omics in breeding programs to simultaneously address salt tolerance and production. To enable future manipulation, selection, and genetic improvement of sorghum with high yield and salt tolerance, here, we explore the potential positive correlations between the reliable indices of sorghum performance under salt stress at the phenotypic and genotypic level. We then explore the potential role of modern selection and genetic improvement programs in incorporating these linked salt tolerance and yield traits and propose a mechanism for future studies.
