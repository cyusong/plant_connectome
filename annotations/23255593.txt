['23255593', 'The B3 DNA-binding domain is a plant-specific domain found throughout the plant  kingdom from the alga Chlamydomonas to grasses and flowering plants. Over 100 B3  domain-containing proteins are found in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and  one of these is critical for accelerating flowering in response to prolonged cold  treatment, an epigenetic process called vernalization. Despite the specific  phenotype of genetic vrn1 mutants, the VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) protein localizes  throughout the nucleus and shows sequence-nonspecific binding in vitro. In this  work, we used a dominant repressor tag that overcomes genetic redundancy to show  that VRN1 is involved in processes beyond vernalization that are essential for  Arabidopsis development. To understand its sequence-nonspecific binding, we  crystallized VRN1(208-341) and solved its crystal structure to 1.6 A resolution  using selenium/single-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods. The crystallized  construct comprises the second VRN1 B3 domain and a preceding region conserved  among VRN1 orthologs but absent in other B3 domains. We established the  DNA-binding face using NMR and then mutated positively charged residues on this  surface with a series of 16 Ala and Glu substitutions, ensuring that the protein  fold was not disturbed using heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR  spectra. The triple mutant R249E/R289E/R296E was almost completely incapable of  DNA binding in vitro. Thus, we have revealed that although VRN1 is  sequence-nonspecific in DNA binding, it has a defined DNA-binding surface.', '2013 Feb 1', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M112.438572', 'Mylne']
