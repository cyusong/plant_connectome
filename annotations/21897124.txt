Plant growth and crop production can be greatly affected by common environmental stresses such as drought, high salinity and low temperatures. Gene expression is affected by several abiotic stresses. Stress-inducible genes are regulated by transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications. In this Mini-Review, we have explored the role of transcriptional adaptor ADA2b in Arabidopsis responses to abiotic stress. ADA2b is required for the expression of genes involved in abiotic stress either by controlling H3 and H4 acetylation in the case of salt stress or affecting nucleosome occupancy in low temperatures response.

ADA2b: !regulates! gene expression
ADA2b: !controls! H3 and H4 acetylation
ADA2b: !affects! nucleosome occupancy
transcription factors: !regulate! stress-inducible genes
histone modifications: !regulate! stress-inducible genes
