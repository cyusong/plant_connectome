In nature, crops encounter a combination of abiotic stresses that severely limit yield. Our aim was to dynamically expose the changes of tomatoes' physiological parameters to drought, heat and their combination and thereby clarify the relationship between the responses to single and combined stress. We studied the effect of single and combined drought and heat stresses on the shoot and root of two tomato cultivars (Sufen No.14 as CV1; Jinlingmeiyu as CV2). After being exposed to combined stress for 6 days, the dry weight of shoot and root significantly decreased. The F<sub>q</sub> '/F<sub>m</sub> ' (quantum yield of photosystem II) was significantly lower in CV1 upon drought and combined stress and in CV2 subjected to combined stress (between days 4 and 6) compared to control. The relative water content during combined stress was significantly lower than control from day 4 to recovery day 2. On days 3 and 6, the water loss rate significantly increased under heat stress and decreased at drought and combined stress, respectively. The combined stress caused severe damages on photosystem II and chloroplast ultrastructure. The root activity after stress recovered even though drought significantly increased the activity from day 2 to day 6. Combined stress result in complex responses during tomato growth. The CV1 was more heat tolerant than CV2, but there was no varietal difference at drought and combined stress. This study contributes to the understanding of the underlying physiological response mechanism of plant to combined stress and crop improvement by providing valuable information for abiotic stress-tolerant tomato breeding.
