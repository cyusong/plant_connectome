The 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) enzyme catalyses the first biosynthetic step of the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. In plants the MEP pathway is involved in the synthesis of the common precursors to the plastidic isoprenoids, isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, in plastids. DXS is recognized as limiting this pathway and is a potential target for manipulation to increase various isoprenoids such as carotenoids. In Zea mays three dxs genes exist that encode plastid-targeted functional enzymes. Evidence is provided that these genes represent phylogenetically distinctive clades conserved among plants preceding monocot-dicot divergence. There is differential accumulation for each dxs gene transcript, during development and in response to external signals such as light. At the protein level, the analysis demonstrates that in Z. mays, DXS protein is feedback regulated in response to the inhibition of the pathway flow. The results support that the multilevel regulation of DXS activity is conserved in evolution.
