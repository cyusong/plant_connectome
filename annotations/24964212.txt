['24964212', 'Chloroplast formation is associated with embryo development and seedling growth.  However, the relationship between chloroplast differentiation and embryo  development remains unclear. Five FtsHi genes that encode proteins with high  similarity to FtsH proteins, but lack Zn2+-binding motifs, are present in the  Arabidopsis genome. In this study, we showed that T-DNA insertion mutations in  the Arabidopsis FtsHi4 gene resulted in embryo arrest at the  globular-to-heart-shaped transition stage. Transmission electron microscopic  analyses revealed abnormal plastid differentiation with a severe defect in  thylakoid formation in the mutant embryos. Immunocytological studies demonstrated  that FtsHi4 localized in chloroplasts as a thylakoid membrane-associated protein,  supporting its essential role in thylakoid membrane formation. We further showed  that FtsHi4 forms protein complexes, and that there was a significant reduction  in the accumulation of D2 and PsbO (two photosystem II proteins) in mutant  ovules. The role of FtsHi4 in chloroplast development was confirmed using an  RNA-interfering approach. Additionally, mutations in other FtsHi genes including  FtsHi1, FtsHi2, and FtsHi5 caused phenotypic abnormalities similar to ftshi4 with  respect to plastid differentiation during embryogenesis. Taken together, our data  suggest that FtsHi4, together with FtsHi1, FtsHi2, and FtsHi5 are essential for  chloroplast development in Arabidopsis.', '2014', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0099741', 'Zhang']
