Lignin is the major phenolic polymer in plant secondary cell walls and is polymerized from monomeric subunits, the monolignols. Eleven enzyme families are implicated in monolignol biosynthesis. Here, we studied the functions of members of the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) families in wood formation in Populus trichocarpa, including the regulatory effects of their transcripts and protein activities on monolignol biosynthesis. Enzyme activity assays from stem-differentiating xylem (SDX) proteins showed that RNAi suppression of PtrCAD1 in P. trichocarpa transgenics caused a reduction in SDX CCR activity. RNAi suppression of PtrCCR2, the only CCR member highly expressed in SDX, caused a reciprocal reduction in SDX protein CAD activities. The enzyme assays of mixed and coexpressed recombinant proteins supported physical interactions between PtrCAD1 and PtrCCR2. Biomolecular fluorescence complementation and pull-down/co-immunoprecipitation experiments supported a hypothesis of PtrCAD1/PtrCCR2 heterodimer formation. These results provide evidence for the formation of PtrCAD1/PtrCCR2 protein complexes in monolignol biosynthesis in planta.
