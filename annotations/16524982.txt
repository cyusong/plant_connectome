Gene regulatory pathways converge at the level of transcription, where interactions among regulatory genes and between regulators and target genes result in the establishment of spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression. The growing identification of direct target genes for key transcription factors (TFs) through traditional and high-throughput experimental approaches has facilitated the elucidation of regulatory networks at the genome level. To integrate this information into a Web-based knowledgebase, we have developed the Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server (AGRIS). AGRIS, which contains all Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) promoter sequences, TFs, and their target genes and functions, provides the scientific community with a platform to establish regulatory networks. AGRIS currently houses three linked databases: AtcisDB (Arabidopsis thaliana cis-regulatory database), AtTFDB (Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factor database), and AtRegNet (Arabidopsis thaliana regulatory network). AtTFDB contains 1,690 Arabidopsis TFs and their sequences (protein and DNA) grouped into 50 (October 2005) families with information on available mutants in the corresponding genes. AtcisDB consists of 25,806 (September 2005) promoter sequences of annotated Arabidopsis genes with a description of putative cis-regulatory elements. AtRegNet links, in direct interactions, several hundred genes with the TFs that control their expression. The current release of AtRegNet contains a total of 187 (September 2005) direct targets for 66 TFs. AGRIS can be accessed at http://Arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu.
