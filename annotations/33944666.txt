Plant long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key chromatin dynamics regulators, directing the transcriptional programs driving a wide variety of developmental outputs. Recently, we uncovered how the lncRNA <i>AUXIN REGULATED PROMOTER LOOP</i> (<i>APOLO</i>) directly recognizes the locus encoding the root hair (RH) master regulator <i>ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6</i> (<i>RHD6</i>) modulating its transcriptional activation and leading to low temperature-induced RH elongation. We further demonstrated that <i>APOLO</i> interacts with the transcription factor WRKY42 in a novel ribonucleoprotein complex shaping <i>RHD6</i> epigenetic environment and integrating signals governing RH growth and development. In this work, we expand this model showing that <i>APOLO</i> is able to bind and positively control the expression of several cell wall EXTENSIN (EXT) encoding genes, including <i>EXT3</i>, a key regulator for RH growth. Interestingly, <i>EXT3</i> emerged as a novel common target of <i>APOLO</i> and WRKY42. Furthermore, we showed that the ROS homeostasis-related gene <i>NADPH OXIDASE C (NOXC)</i> is deregulated upon <i>APOLO</i> overexpression, likely through the RHD6-RSL4 pathway, and that <i>NOXC</i> is required for low temperature-dependent enhancement of RH growth. Collectively, our results uncover an intricate regulatory network involving the <i>APOLO</i>/WRKY42 hub in the control of master and effector genes during RH development.
