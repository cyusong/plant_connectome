Verticillium wilt (VW) caused by <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> is a soil-borne vascular fungal disease that severely affects cotton yield and fiber quality. Sugar metabolism plays an important role in the growth and pathogenicity of <i>V. dahliae</i>. However, limited information is known about the sugar transporter genes and their roles in the growth and pathogenicity of <i>V. dahliae</i>. In this study, genome-wide identification of sugar transporter genes in <i>V. dahliae</i> was conducted and the expression profiles of these genes in response to root exudates from cotton varieties susceptible or resistant to <i>V. dahliae</i> were investigated based on RNA-seq data. Tobacco Rattle Virus-based host-induced gene silencing (TRV-based HIGS) and artificial small interfering RNAs (asiRNAs) were applied to investigate the function of candidate genes involved in the growth and pathogenic process of <i>V. dahliae</i>. A total of 65 putative sugar transporter genes were identified and clustered into 8 Clades. Of the 65 sugar transporter genes, 9 were found to be induced only by root exudates from the susceptible variety, including <i>VdST3</i> and <i>VdST12</i> that were selected for further functional study. Silencing of <i>VdST3</i> or <i>VdST12</i> in host plants by TRV-based HIGS reduced fungal biomass and enhanced cotton resistance against <i>V. dahliae</i>. Additionally, silencing of <i>VdST12</i> and <i>VdST3</i> by feeding asiRNAs targeting <i>VdST12</i> (asiR815 or asiR1436) and <i>VdST3</i> (asiR201 or asiR1238) inhibited fungal growth, exhibiting significant reduction in hyphae and colony diameter, with a more significant effect observed for the asiRNAs targeting <i>VdST12</i>. The inhibitory effect of asiRNAs on the growth of <i>V. dahliae</i> was enhanced with the increasing concentration of asiRNAs. Silencing of <i>VdST12</i> by feeding asiR815+asiR1436 significantly decreased the pathogenicity of <i>V. dahliae</i>. The results suggest that <i>VdST3</i> and <i>VdST12</i> are sugar transporter genes required for growth and pathogenicity of <i>V. dahliae</i> and that asiRNA is a valuable tool for functional characterization of <i>V. dahliae</i> genes.
