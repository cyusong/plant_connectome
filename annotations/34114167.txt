A number of mutational changes in transcriptional regulators of defense metabolism have occurred during plant domestication and improvement. Plant domestication and improvement entail genetic changes that underlie divergence in development and metabolism, providing a tremendous model of biological evolution. Plant metabolism produces numerous specialized alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics, and cyanogenic glucosides with indispensable roles in defense against herbivory and microbial infection. Many compounds toxic or deterrent to predators have been eliminated through domestication and breeding. Series of genes involved in defense metabolism are coordinately regulated by transcription factors that specifically recognize cis-regulatory elements in promoter regions of downstream target genes. Recent developments in DNA sequencing technologies and genomic approaches have facilitated studies of the metabolic and genetic changes in chemical defense that have occurred via human-mediated selection, many of which result from mutations in transcriptional regulators of defense metabolism. In this article, we review such examples in almond (Prunus dulcis), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), pepper (Capsicum spp.), potato (Solanum tuberosum), quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and related species and discuss insights into the evolution and regulation of metabolic pathways for specialized defense compounds.
