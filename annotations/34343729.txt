High concentrations of As in contaminated environments pose a serious threat to plant, human, and animal health. In this study, we characterized an As-responsive Really Interesting New Gene (RING) E3 ubiquitin ligase gene under arsenate (AsV) stress, named as Oryza sativa As-Induced RING E3 ligase 3 (OsAIR3). AsV treatment highly induced the expression of OsAIR3. OsAIR3-EYFP was localized to the nucleus in rice protoplasts and exhibited E3 ligase activity. Yeast two-hybrid screening and bimolecular fluorescence complementation and pull-down assays revealed the interaction of OsAIR3 with an O. sativa molybdate transporter (OsMOT1;3) in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. In addition, an in vitro cell-free degradation assay was performed to demonstrate the degradation of OsMOT1;3 by OsAIR3 via the 26S proteasome system. Heterogeneous overexpression of OsAIR3 in Arabidopsis yielded AsV-tolerant phenotypes, as indicated by the comparison of cotyledon expansion, root elongation, shoot fresh weight, and As accumulation between the OsAIR3-overexpressing and control plants. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsAIR3 positively regulates plant response to AsV stress.
