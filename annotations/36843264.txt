Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) is one of the popular fruits world-wide, and its quality is mainly determined by key metabolites (sugars, flavonoids, and vitamins). Previous works on kiwifruit are mostly done via a single omics approach or involve only limited metabolites. Consequently, the dynamic metabolomes during kiwifruit development and ripening and the underlying regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, using high-resolution metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses, we investigated kiwifruit metabolic landscapes at 11 different developmental and ripening stages and revealed a parallel classification of 515 metabolites and their co-expressed genes into 10 distinct metabolic vs gene modules (MM vs GM). Through integrative bioinformatics coupled with functional genomic assays, we constructed a global map and uncovered essential transcriptomic and transcriptional regulatory networks for all major metabolic changes that occurred throughout the kiwifruit growth cycle. Apart from known MM vs GM for metabolites such as soluble sugars, we identified novel transcription factors that regulate the accumulation of procyanidins, vitamin C, and other important metabolites. Our findings thus shed light on the kiwifruit metabolic regulatory network and provide a valuable resource for the designed improvement of kiwifruit quality.
