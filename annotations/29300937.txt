Strigolactones are plant hormones that control many aspects of plant development and environmental responses. Despite recent and rapid progress in the biochemical and molecular understanding of strigolactone biosynthesis, transport, and signaling, our knowledge about where strigolactones are produced and where they act is fragmented. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about these aspects of strigolactones, obtained from mutant phenotypes, grafting experiments, gene expression patterns, and protein localization studies. We also discuss the potential of new imaging technologies to reveal the spatial regulation of strigolactone function.
