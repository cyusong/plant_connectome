['25616872', 'The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many aspects of plant development  and the stress response. The intracellular E3 ligase SDIR1 (SALT- AND  DROUGHT-INDUCED REALLY INTERESTING NEW GENE FINGER1) plays a key role in ABA  signaling, regulating ABA-related seed germination and the stress response. In  this study, we found that SDIR1 is localized on the endoplasmic reticulum  membrane in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using cell biology, molecular biology, and  biochemistry approaches, we demonstrated that SDIR1 interacts with and  ubiquitinates its substrate, SDIRIP1 (SDIR1-INTERACTING PROTEIN1), to modulate  SDIRIP1 stability through the 26S proteasome pathway. SDIRIP1 acts genetically  downstream of SDIR1 in ABA and salt stress signaling. In detail, SDIRIP1  selectively regulates the expression of the downstream basic region/leucine  zipper motif transcription factor gene ABA-INSENSITIVE5, rather than  ABA-RESPONSIVE ELEMENTS BINDING FACTOR3 (ABF3) or ABF4, to regulate ABA-mediated  seed germination and the plant salt response. Overall, the SDIR1/SDIRIP1 complex  plays a vital role in ABA signaling through the ubiquitination pathway.', '2015 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.134163', 'Xie']
