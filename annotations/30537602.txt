UV radiation is a serious threat to life, and algae have developed highly efficient adaptations to UV radiation through the course of evolution. To date, studies investigating the mechanisms of UV adaptation in algae have focused on physiological regulation and associated protein coding genes, with only a few reports on associated protein non-coding genes. In a previous study, we found that Cre-miR914 was significantly down-regulated in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in response to heat shock. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether Cre-miR914 plays a role in response to UV-B radiation. Our bioinformatics analysis indicated that the potential target gene of Cre-miR914 is ribosomal protein L18 (RPL18). We also measured the expression of Cre-miR914 and RPL18 in response to UV-B radiation through qPCR analysis. Then, we constructed cell lines overexpressing Cre-miR914 or RPL18, and performed survival experiments under UV-B stress. The results showed that Cre-miR914 overexpression decreased resistance while RPL18 overexpression enhanced tolerance to UV-B radiation. These results indicate that Cre-miR914 and its potential target gene RPL18 are involved in the adaptation to UV-B in C. reinhardtii.
