The purple acid phosphatase AtPAP26 plays a central role in Pi-scavenging by Pi-starved (-Pi) Arabidopsis. Mass spectrometry (MS) of AtPAP26-S1 and AtPAP26-S2 glycoforms secreted by -Pi suspension cells demonstrated that N-glycans at Asn<sup>365</sup> and Asn<sup>422</sup> were modified in AtPAP26-S2 to form high-mannose glycans. A 55-kDa protein that co-purified with AtPAP26-S2 was identified as a Galanthus nivalis agglutinin-related and apple domain lectin-1 (AtGAL1; At1g78850). MS revealed that AtGAL1 was bisphosphorylated at Tyr<sup>38</sup> and Thr<sup>39</sup> and glycosylated at four conserved Asn residues. When AtGAL was incubated in the presence of a thiol-reducing reagent prior to immunoblotting, its cross-reactivity with anti-AtGAL1-IgG was markedly attenuated (consistent with three predicted disulfide bonds in AtGAL1's apple domain). Secreted AtGAL1 polypeptides were upregulated to a far greater extent than AtGAL1 transcripts during Pi deprivation, indicating posttranscriptional control of AtGAL1 expression. Growth of a -Pi atgal1 mutant was unaffected, possibly due to compensation by AtGAL1's closest paralog, AtGAL2 (At1g78860). Nevertheless, AtGAL1's induction by numerous stresses combined with the broad distribution of AtGAL1-like lectins in diverse species implies an important function for AtGAL1 orthologs within the plant kingdom. We hypothesize that binding of AtPAP26-S2's high-mannose glycans by AtGAL1 enhances AtPAP26 function to facilitate Pi-scavenging by -Pi Arabidopsis.
