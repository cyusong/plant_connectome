Seed size is determined by the coordinated growth of the embryo, endosperm, and integument. Growth of the integument is initiated by signal molecules released from the developing endosperm or embryo. Although recent studies have identified many components that regulate seed size by controlling integument growth, the upstream signals and the signal transduction pathway that activate these components after double fertilization are unclear. Here, we report that the receptor-like kinase ERECTA (ER) controls seed size by regulating outer integument cell proliferation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Seeds from er mutants were smaller, while those from ER-overexpressing plants were larger, than those of control plants. Different from its role in regulating the development of other organs, ER regulates seed size via a novel mechanism that is independent of its intracellular domain. Our genetic and biochemical data show that a MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE (MAPK) signaling pathway comprising MAPK-KINASE 4/5, MAPK 3/6 (MPK3/6), DA1, and UBIQUITIN SPECIFIC PROTEASE 15 (UBP15) functions downstream of ER and modulates seed size. MPK3/6 phosphorylation inactivates and destabilizes DA1 to increase the abundance of UBP15, promoting outer integument cell proliferation and increasing seed size. Our study illustrates a nearly completed ER-mediated signaling pathway that regulates seed size and will help uncover the mechanism that coordinates embryo, endosperm, and integument growth after double fertilization.
