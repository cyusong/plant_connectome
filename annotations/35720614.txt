Powdery mildew of wheat is a foliar disease that is spread worldwide. Cultivation of resistant varieties is the most effective, economical, and environmentally friendly strategy to curb this disease. Powdery mildew resistance genes (<i>Pm</i>) are the primary resources for resistance breeding, and new <i>Pm</i> genes are in constant demand. Previously, we identified <i>Aegilops longissima</i> chromosome 6S<sup>l</sup>#3 as a carrier of powdery mildew resistance and designated the resistance gene as <i>Pm6Sl</i>. Here, we reported the design of 24 markers specific to 6S<sup>l</sup>#3 on the basis of the full-length cDNA sequences of 6S<sup>l</sup>#3 donor <i>Ae</i>. <i>longissma</i> accession TA1910, and the development of wheat-<i>Ae. longissima</i> 6S<sup>l</sup>#3 introgression stocks by <i>ph1b-</i>induced homoeologous recombination. Further, 6S<sup>l</sup>#3 introgression lines were identified and characterized by integration analysis of powdery mildew responses, <i>in situ</i> hybridization, and molecular markers and <i>Pm6Sl</i> was mapped to a distal interval of 42.80 Mb between markers Ael58410 and Ael57699 in the long arm of 6S<sup>l</sup>#3. Two resistant recombinants, R43 (T6BS.6BL-6S<sup>l</sup>#3L) and T27 (Ti6AS.6AL-6S<sup>l</sup>#3L-6AL), contained segments harboring <i>Pm6Sl</i> with less than 8% of 6S<sup>l</sup>#3 genomic length, and two markers were diagnostic for <i>Pm6Sl</i>. This study broadened powdery mildew resistance gene resources for wheat improvement and provided a fundamental basis for fine mapping and cloning of <i>Pm6Sl</i> to further understand its molecular mechanism of disease resistance.
