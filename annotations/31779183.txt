Regulation of abscission is an important agricultural concern since precocious abscission can reduce crop yield. INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) peptide and its receptors the HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-like2 (HSL2) kinases have been revealed to be core components controlling floral organ abscission in the model plant Arabidopsis. However, it is still unclear whether the homologs of IDA-HAE/HSL2 in non-model plants are correlated to abscission. Previously, we found LcIDL1, a homolog of IDA from litchi, has a similar role to AtIDA in control of floral organ abscission in Arabidopsis. Here, we further isolated an HAESA-like homolog, <i>LcHSL2</i>, which is likely involved in the fruitlet abscission in litchi. Ectopic expression of <i>LcHSL2</i> in wild type Arabidopsis has no effect on the floral organ abscission. However, its presence in the <i>hae hsl2</i> mutant background completely rescued the floral organ abscission deficiency. LcHSL2 is localized in the cell membrane and the <i>LcHSL2</i> gene is expressed at the pedicel abscission zone (AZ) of litchi and floral AZ of Arabidopsis. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression level of <i>LcHSL2</i> was increased during ethephon-induced fruitlet abscission in litchi. Taken together, our findings suggest that HSL2 homologs have functional conservation in Arabidopsis and litchi, and LcHSL2 might play a critical role in regulation of fruitlet abscission in litchi.
