Time to flowering (vegetative to reproductive phase) is tightly regulated by endogenous factors and environmental cues to ensure proper and successful reproduction. How endogenous factors coordinate with environmental signals to regulate flowering time in plants is unclear. Transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) and its homolog EIN3 LIKE 1 (EIL1) are the core downstream regulators in ethylene signal transduction, and their null mutants exhibit late flowering in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana); however, the precise mechanism of floral transition remains unknown. Here, we reveal that FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD), encoding a histone demethylase acting in the autonomous pathway of floral transition, physically associates with EIN3 and EIL1. Loss of EIN3 and EIL1 up-regulated transcriptional expression of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and its homologs in Arabidopsis, and ethylene-insensitive mutants displayed inhibited flowering in a FLC-dependent manner. We further demonstrated that EIN3 and EIL1 directly bind to FLC loci, modulating their expression by recruiting FLD and thereafter removing di-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2) at FLC loci. In plants treated with 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, decreased expression of FLD resulted in increased enrichment of H3K4me2 at FLC loci and transcriptional activation of FLC, leading to floral repression. Our study reveals the role of EIN3 and EIL1 in FLC-dependent and ethylene-induced floral repression and elucidates how phytohormone signals are transduced into chromatin-based transcriptional regulation.
