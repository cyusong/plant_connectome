Rhizobium etli occurs either in a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with its host plant, Phaseolus vulgaris, or free-living in the soil. During both conditions, the bacterium has been suggested to reside primarily in a nongrowing state. Using genome-wide transcriptome profiles, we here examine the molecular basis of the physiological adaptations of rhizobia to nongrowth inside and outside of the host. Compared with exponentially growing cells, we found an extensive overlap of downregulated growth-associated genes during both symbiosis and stationary phase, confirming the essentially nongrowing state of nitrogen-fixing bacteroids in determinate nodules that are not terminally differentiated. In contrast, the overlap of upregulated genes was limited. Generally, actively growing cells have hitherto been used as reference to analyze symbiosis-specific expression. However, this prevents the distinction between differential expression arising specifically from adaptation to a symbiotic lifestyle and features associated with nongrowth in general. Using stationary phase as the reference condition, we report a distinct transcriptome profile for bacteroids, containing 203 induced and 354 repressed genes. Certain previously described symbiosis-specific characteristics, such as the downregulation of amino acid metabolism genes, were no longer observed, indicating that these features are more likely due to the nongrowing state of bacteroids rather than representing bacteroid-specific physiological adaptations.
