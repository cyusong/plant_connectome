In plants, 14-3-3 proteins are recognized as mediators of signal transduction and function in both development and stress response. However, there are only a few preliminary functional researches in the C4 crop foxtail millet. Here, phylogenetic analysis categorized foxtail millet 14-3-3s (SiGRFs) into 10 discrete groups (Clusters I to X). Transcriptome and qPCR analyses showed that all the <i>SiGRFs</i> responded to at least one abiotic stress. All but one <i>SiGRF-</i>overexpressing (OE) <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> line (<i>SiGRF1</i>) exhibited insensitivity to abiotic stresses during seed germination and seedling growth. Compared with the Col-0 wild-type, <i>SiGRF1-OEs</i> had slightly lower germination rates and smaller leaves. However, flowering time of <i>SiGRF1-OEs</i> occurred earlier than that of Col-0 under high-salt stress. Interaction of SiGRF1 with a foxtail millet E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (SiRNF1/2) indicates that the proteinase system might hydrolyze SiGRF1. Further investigation showed that SiGRF1 localized in the cytoplasm, and its gene was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues throughout various developmental stages. Additionally, flowering-related genes, <i>WRKY71</i>, <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i>, <i>LEAFY</i>, and <i>FRUITFULL</i>, in <i>SiGRF1-OEs</i> exhibited considerably higher expression levels than those in Col-0 under salinity-stressed conditions. Results suggest that <i>SiGRF1</i> hastens flowering, thereby providing a means for foxtail millet to complete its life cycle and avoid further salt stress.
