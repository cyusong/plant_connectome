Taking into account the strong iron competition in the rhizosphere and the high affinity of pyoverdines for Fe(III), these molecules are expected to interfere with the iron nutrition of plants, as they do with rhizospheric microbes. The impact of Fe-pyoverdine on iron content of Arabidopsis thaliana was compared with that of Fe-EDTA. Iron chelated to pyoverdine was incorporated in a more efficient way than when chelated to EDTA, leading to increased plant growth of the wild type. A transgenic line of A. thaliana overexpressing ferritin showed a higher iron content than the wild type when supplemented with Fe-EDTA but a lower iron content when supplemented with Fe-pyoverdine despite its increased reductase activity, suggesting that this activity was not involved in the iron uptake from pyoverdine. A mutant knock-out iron transporter IRT1 showed lower iron and chlorophyll contents when supplemented with Fe-EDTA than the wild type but not when supplemented with Fe-pyoverdine, indicating that, in contrast to iron from EDTA, iron from pyoverdine was not incorporated through the IRT1 transporter. Altogether these data suggest that iron from Fe-pyoverdine was not incorporated in planta through the strategy I, which is based on reductase activity and IRT1 transporter. This is supported by the presence of pyoverdine in planta as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by tracing 15N of 15N-pyoverdine.
