Pathogenesis of Pseudoperonospora cubensis causing downy mildew of cucumber resulted in changes in the metabolic processes within cucumber leaves including the transpiration rate. Due to the negative correlation between transpiration rate and leaf temperature, digital infrared thermography permitted a non-invasive monitoring and an indirect visualization of downy mildew development. Depending on the stage of pathogenesis and the topology of chloroses and necroses, infection resulted in a typical temperature pattern. Spatial heterogeneity of the leaf temperature could be quantified by the maximum temperature difference (MTD) within a leaf. The MTD increased during pathogenesis with the formation of necrotic tissue and was related to disease severity as described by linear and quadratic regression curves. Under controlled conditions, changes in temperature of infected leaves allowed the discrimination between healthy and infected areas in thermograms, even before visible symptoms of downy mildew appeared. Environmental conditions during thermographic measurement, in particular air temperature and humidity, as well as water content and age of the leaf influenced the temperature of its surface. Conditions enhancing the transpiration rate facilitated the detection of changes in leaf temperature of infected leaves at early stages of infection. As modified by environmental conditions, MTD alone is not suitable for the quantification of downy mildew severity in the field.
