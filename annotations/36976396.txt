During the light induction of somatic embryogenesis, phyB-Pfr suppresses Phytoglobin 2, known to elevate nitric oxide (NO). NO depresses Phytochrome Interacting Factor 4 (PIF4) relieving its inhibition on embryogenesis through auxin. An obligatory step of many in vitro embryogenic systems is the somatic-embryogenic transition culminating with the formation of the embryogenic tissue. In Arabidopsis, this transition requires light and is facilitated by high levels of nitric oxide (NO) generated by either suppression of the NO scavenger Phytoglobin 2 (Pgb2), or its removal from the nucleus. Using a previously characterized induction system regulating the cellular localization of Pgb2, we demonstrated the interplay between phytochrome B (phyB) and Pgb2 during the formation of embryogenic tissue. The deactivation of phyB in the dark coincides with the induction of Pgb2 known to reduce the level of NO; consequently, embryogenesis is inhibited. Under light conditions, the active form of phyB depresses the levels of Pgb2 transcripts, thus expecting an increase in cellular NO. Induction of Pgb2 increases Phytochrome Interacting Factor 4 (PIF4) suggesting that high levels of NO repress PIF4. The PIF4 inhibition is sufficient to induce several auxin biosynthetic (CYP79B2, AMI1, and YUCCA 1, 2, and 6) and response (ARF5, 8, and 16) genes, conducive to the formation of the embryonic tissue and production of somatic embryos. Auxin responses mediated by ARF10 and 17 appear to be regulated by Pgb2, possibly through NO, in a PIF4-independent fashion. Overall, this work provides a new and preliminary model integrating Pgb2 (and NO) with phyB in the light regulation of in vitro embryogenesis.
