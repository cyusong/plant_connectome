['17335514', 'A genetic screen was performed to isolate mutants showing increased arsenic  tolerance using an Arabidopsis thaliana population of activation tagged lines.  The most arsenic-resistant mutant shows increased arsenate and arsenite  tolerance. Genetic analyses of the mutant indicate that the mutant contains two  loci that contribute to arsenic tolerance, designated ars4 and ars5. The ars4ars5  double mutant contains a single T-DNA insertion, ars4, which co-segregates with  arsenic tolerance and is inserted in the Phytochrome A (PHYA) gene, strongly  reducing the expression of PHYA. When grown under far-red light conditions  ars4ars5 shows the same elongated hypocotyl phenotype as the previously described  strong phyA-211 allele. Three independent phyA alleles, ars4, phyA-211 and a new  T-DNA insertion allele (phyA-t) show increased tolerance to arsenate, although to  a lesser degree than the ars4ars5 double mutant. Analyses of the ars5 single  mutant show that ars5 exhibits stronger arsenic tolerance than ars4, and that  ars5 is not linked to ars4. Arsenic tolerance assays with phyB-9 and phot1/phot2  mutants show that these photoreceptor mutants do not exhibit phyA-like arsenic  tolerance. Fluorescence HPLC analyses show that elevated levels of phytochelatins  were not detected in ars4, ars5 or ars4ars5, however increases in the thiols  cysteine, gamma-glutamylcysteine and glutathione were observed. Compared with  wild type, the total thiol levels in ars4, ars5 and ars4ars5 mutants were  increased up to 80% with combined buthionine sulfoximine and arsenic treatments,  suggesting the enhancement of mechanisms that mediate thiol synthesis in the  mutants. The presented findings show that PHYA negatively regulates a pathway  conferring arsenic tolerance, and that an enhanced thiol synthesis mechanism  contributes to the arsenic tolerance of ars4ars5.', '2007 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.03018.x', 'Schroeder']
