['10504581', 'Many proteins are transported to the plant vacuole through the secretory pathway  in small transport vesicles by a series of vesicle budding and fusion reactions.  Vesicles carrying vacuolar cargo bud from the trans-Golgi network are thought to  fuse with a pre-vacuolar compartment before being finally transported to the  vacuole. In mammals and yeast, the fusion of a vesicle with its target organelle  is mediated by a 20S protein complex containing membrane and soluble proteins  that appear to be conserved between different species. A number of membrane  proteins have been identified in plants that show sequence similarity with a  family of integral membrane proteins (t-SNAREs) on target organelles that are  required for the fusion of transport vesicles with that organelle. However, the  biochemical function of these proteins has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate  for the first time the formation of a 20S complex in plants that has  characteristics of complexes involved in vesicle fusion. This complex contains  AtPEP12p, an Arabidopsis protein thought to be involved in protein transport to  the prevacuolar compartment. In addition, we have shown that AtPEP12p can bind to  alpha-SNAP, indicating that AtPEP12p does indeed function as a SNAP receptor or  SNARE. These preliminary data suggest that AtPEP12p may function jointly with  alpha-SNAP and NSF in the fusion of transport vesicles containing vacuolar cargo  proteins with the pre-vacuolar compartment.', '1999 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.1999.00552.x', 'Raikhel']
