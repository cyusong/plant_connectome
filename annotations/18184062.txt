RNA silencing suppressor genes derived from six virus genera were transformed into Nicotiana benthamiana and N. tabacum plants. These suppressors were P1 of Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV), P1 of Cocksfoot mottle virus, P19 of Tomato bushy stunt virus, P25 of Potato virus X, HcPro of Potato virus Y (strain N), 2b of Cucumber mosaic virus (strain Kin), and AC2 of African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV). HcPro caused the most severe phenotypes in both Nicotiana spp. AC2 also produced severe effects in N. tabacum but a much milder phenotype in N. benthamiana, although both HcPro and AC2 affected the leaf tissues of the two Nicotiana spp. in similar ways, causing hyperplasia and hypoplasia, respectively. P1-RYMV caused high lethality in the N. benthamiana plants but only mild effects in the N. tabacum plants. Phenotypic alterations produced by the other transgenes were minor in both species. Interestingly, the suppressors had very different effects on crucifer-infecting Tobamovirus (crTMV) infections. AC2 enhanced both spread and brightness of the crTMV-green fluorescent protein (GFP) lesions, whereas 2b and both P1 suppressors enhanced spread but not brightness of these lesions. P19 promoted spread of the infection into new foci within the infiltrated leaf, whereas HcPro and P25 suppressed the spread of crTMV-GFP lesions.
