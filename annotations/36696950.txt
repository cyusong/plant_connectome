The auxin efflux PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are conserved in all land plants and important players in plant development. In the moss Physcomitrella (Physcomitrium patens), three canonical PINs (PpPINA-C) are expressed in the leafy shoot (gametophore). PpPINA and PpPINB show functional activity in vegetative growth and sporophyte development. Here, we examined the role of PpPINC in the life cycle of Physcomitrella. We established reporter and knockout lines for PpPINC and analysed vegetative and reproductive tissues using microscopy and transcriptomic sequencing of moss gametangia. PpPINC is expressed in immature leaves, mature gametangia and during sporophyte development. The sperm cells (spermatozoids) of pinC knockout mutants exhibit increased motility and an altered flagella phenotype. Furthermore, the pinC mutants have a higher portion of differentially expressed genes related to spermatogenesis, increased fertility and an increased abortion rate of premeiotic sporophytes. Here, we show that PpPINC is important for spermatogenesis and sporophyte retention. We propose an evolutionary conserved way of polar growth during early moss embryo development and sporophyte attachment to the gametophore while suggesting the mechanical function in sporophyte retention of a ring structure, the Lorch ring.
