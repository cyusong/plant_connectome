['26576746', 'Photomorphogenesis is an essential program in plant development. This process is  effected by the balanced cooperation of many factors under light and dark  conditions. In a previous study, we showed that MYB hypocotyl elongation-related  (MYBH) is involved in cell elongation. To expand our understanding of MYBH  function, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay and identified an MYB-like Domain  transcription factor (MYBD). In this study, we investigated the function of MYBD,  which is an MYBH homolog involved in anthocyanin accumulation. MYBD expression  increased in response to light or cytokinin, and MYBD enhanced anthocyanin  biosynthesis via repression of MYBL2, which encodes a transcription factor that  has a negative effect on this process. In addition, MYBD binding in vivo to the  MYBL2 promoter and the lower level of histone H3K9 acetylation at the upstream  region of MYBL2 in MYBD over-expressing plants in comparison with wild-type  plants imply that MYBD represses MYBL2 expression via an epigenetic mechanism.  HY5 directly binds to the MYBD promoter, which indicates that MYBD acts on  HY5-downstream in light- or cytokinin-triggered signaling pathways, leading to  anthocyanin accumulation. Our results suggest that, although MYBD and MYBH are  homologs, they act in opposite ways during plant photomorphogenesis, and these  functions should be examined in further studies.', '2015 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13077', 'Lee']
