Leaf development entails the transition from a small group of undifferentiated cells to a structure of defined size and shape, highly organized into different cell types with specialized functions. During this developmental sequence, patterning, growth, and differentiation have to be tightly coordinated by intricate regulatory networks in which small RNAs [microRNAs (miRNAs) and trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs)] have emerged during the last years as essential players. In this review, after having given an overview of miRNA and ta-siRNA biogenesis and mode of action, their contribution to the life of a leaf from initiation to senescence is described. MiRNA and ta-siRNA are not merely regulators of gene expression patterns, but, by acting both locally and at the whole organ scale, they have an essential role in the coordination of complex developmental processes and are fully integrated in genetic networks and signalling pathways.
