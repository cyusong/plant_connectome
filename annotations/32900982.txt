The large sunflower family, Asteraceae, is characterized by compressed, flower-like inflorescences that may bear phenotypically distinct flower types. The CYCLOIDEA (CYC)/TEOSINTE BRANCHED1-like transcription factors (TFs) belonging to the TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR (TCP) protein family are known to regulate bilateral symmetry in single flowers. In Asteraceae, they function at the inflorescence level, and were recruited to define differential flower type identities. Here, we identified upstream regulators of <i>GhCYC3</i>, a gene that specifies ray flower identity at the flower head margin in the model plant <i>Gerbera hybrida</i> We discovered a previously unidentified expression domain and functional role for the paralogous CINCINNATA-like TCP proteins. They function upstream of <i>GhCYC3</i> and affect the developmental delay of marginal ray primordia during their early ontogeny. At the level of single flowers, the Asteraceae <i>CYC</i> genes show a unique function in regulating the elongation of showy ventral ligules that play a major role in pollinator attraction. We discovered that during ligule development, the E class MADS-box TF GRCD5 activates <i>GhCYC3</i> expression. We propose that the C class MADS-box TF GAGA1 contributes to stamen development upstream of <i>GhCYC3</i> Our data demonstrate how interactions among and between the conserved floral regulators, TCP and MADS-box TFs, contribute to the evolution of the elaborate inflorescence architecture of Asteraceae.
