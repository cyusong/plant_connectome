Verticillium wilt, caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, is the major cause of disease-related yield losses in cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). Despite these losses, the major cultivars of <i>G. hirsutum</i> remain highly susceptible to Verticillium wilt. The lack of understanding on the genetic basis for Verticillium wilt resistance may further hinder progress in deploying elite cultivars with proven resistance, such as the wilt resistant <i>G. hirsutum</i> cultivar Zhongzhimian No. 2. To help remedy this knowledge gap, we sequenced the whole genome of Zhongzhimian No. 2 and assembled it from a combination of PacBio long reads, Illumina short reads, and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture technologies. The final assembly of the genome was 2.33 Gb, encoding 95,327 predicted coding sequences. The GC content was 34.39% with 99.2% of the bases anchored to 26 pseudo-chromosomes that ranged from 53.8 to 127.7 Mb. This resource will help gain a detailed understanding of the genomic features governing high yield and Verticillium wilt resistance in this cultivar. Comparative genomics will be particularly helpful, since there are several published genomes of other <i>Gossypium</i> species. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
