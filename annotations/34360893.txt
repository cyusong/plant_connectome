Flowering is a morphogenetic process in which angiosperms shift from vegetative growth to reproductive growth. Flowering time has a strong influence on fruit growth, which is closely related to productivity. Therefore, research on crop flowering time is particularly important. To better understand the flowering period of the tomato, we performed transcriptome sequencing of early flower buds and flowers during the extension period in the later-flowering "Moneymaker" material and the earlier-flowering "20965" homozygous inbred line, and we analyzed the obtained data. At least 43.92 million clean reads were obtained from 12 datasets, and the similarity with the tomato internal reference genome was 92.86-94.57%. Based on gene expression and background annotations, 49 candidate genes related to flowering time and flower development were initially screened, among which the greatest number belong to the photoperiod pathway. According to the expression pattern of candidate genes, the cause of early flowering of "20965" is predicted. The modes of action of the differentially expressed genes were classified, and the results show that they are closely related to hormone regulation and participated in a variety of life activities in crops. The candidate genes we screened and the analysis of their expression patterns provide a basis for future functional verification, helping to explore the molecular mechanism of tomato flowering time more comprehensively.
