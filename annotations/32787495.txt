SABATH methyltransferases convent plant small-molecule metabolites into volatile methyl esters, which play important roles in many biological processes and defense reactions in plants. In this study, a total of 32 <i>SABATH</i> genes were identified in the <i>Camellia sinensis</i> var. <i>sinensis</i> (CSS) genome, which were renamed CsSABATH1 to CsSABATH32. Genome location annotation suggested that tandem duplication was responsible for the expansion of <i>SABATH</i> genes in tea plant. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that the CsSABATHs could be classified into three groups (I, II and III), which were also supported by gene structures and conserved motifs analysis. Group II contained only two CsSABATH proteins, which were closely related to PtIAMT, AtIAMT and OsIAMT. The group III SABATH genes of tea plant exhibited expansion on the CSS genome compared with <i>Camellia sinensis</i> var. <i>assamica</i> (CSA) genome. Based on RNA-seq data, the <i>CsSABATHs</i> exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns, and the members with high expression in buds and young leaves were also obviously upregulated after MeJA treatment. The expression of many transcription factors was significantly correlated with that of different members of the <i>CsSABATH</i> gene family, suggesting a potential regulatory relationship between them. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) expression analysis showed that <i>CsSABATHs</i> could respond to exogenous JA, SA and MeSA treatments in tea plants. RNA-seq data analysis and qPCR validation suggested that <i>CsSABATH8</i>, 11, 16, 25, 29 and 32 might play a special role in plant defense against insect herbivory. These results provide references for evolutionary studies of the plant <i>SABATH</i> family and the exploration of the potential roles of <i>CsSABATHs</i> in tea plant defense responses.
