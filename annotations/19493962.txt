The promoters of the three Arabidopsis nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6b (AtCOX6b) have similar expression patterns, with preferential expression in anthers and meristems, and are induced by sucrose and etiolation. Additionally, induction of AtCOX6b-1 by GA(3) and AtCOX6b-3 by 6-benzylaminopurine was observed. Site II elements (TGGGCC/T) present in the three promoters bind common nuclear proteins and are important for basal and induced expression. Induction by sucrose requires, in addition, the integrity of elements with the sequence TACTAA. The results imply the participation of common regulatory factors in the expression of the three Arabidopsis COX6b genes.
