['28622431', 'Drought stress is one of the abiotic stresses that limit plant growth and  agricultural productivity. To further understand the mechanism of drought  tolerance and identify the genes involved in this process, a genetic screen for  altered drought response was conducted in Arabidopsis. One mutant with enhanced  drought tolerance was isolated and named Arabidopsis drought tolerance mutant 1  (atdtm1), which has larger lateral organs, prolonged growth duration, increased  relative water content and a reduced leaf stomatal density compared with the wild  type. The loss of AtDTM1 increases cell division during leaf development. The  phenotype is caused by the loss of a T-DNA tagged gene encoding CYCLIN-DEPENDENT  KINASE C;2 (CDKC;2), which functions in the regulation of transcription by  influencing the phosphorylation status of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Here, we  show that CDKC;2 affects the transcription of downstream genes such as cell cycle  genes and genes involved in stomatal development, resulting in altered plant  organ size as well as drought tolerance of the plant. These results reveal the  crucial role of CDKC;2 in modulating both cell division and the drought response  in Arabidopsis.', '2017 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13609', 'Wu']
