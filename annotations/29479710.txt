Both strigolactones (SLs) and nitric oxide (NO) are regulatory signals with diverse roles during plant development and stress responses. This review aims to discuss the so far available data regarding SLs-NO interplay in plant systems. The majority of the few articles dealing with SL-NO interplay focuses on the root system and it seems that NO can be an upstream negative regulator of SL biosynthesis or an upstream positive regulator of SL signaling depending on the nutrient supply. From the so far published results it is clear that NO modifies the activity of target proteins involved in SL biosynthesis or signaling which may be a physiologically relevant interaction. Therefore, in silico analysis of NO-dependent posttranslational modifications in SL-related proteins was performed using computational prediction tools and putative NO-target proteins were specified. The picture is presumably more complicated, since also SL is able to modify NO levels. As a confirmation, author detected NO levels in different organs of max1-1 and max2-1 Arabidopsis and compared to the wild-type these mutants showed enhanced NO levels in their root tips indicating the negative effect of endogenous SLs on NO metabolism. Exogenous SL analogue-triggered NO production seems to contradict the results of the genetic study, which is an inconsistency should be taken into consideration in the future. In the coming years, the link between SL and NO signaling in further physiological processes should be examined and the possibilities of NO-dependent posttranslational modifications of SL biosynthetic and signaling proteins should be looked more closely.
