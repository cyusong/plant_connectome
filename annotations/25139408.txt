['25139408', 'The enzymatic mechanism that governs the synthesis of the xylan backbone polymer,  a linear chain of xylose residues connected by beta-1,4 glycosidic linkages, has  remained elusive. Xylan is a major constituent of many kinds of plant cell walls,  and genetic studies have identified multiple genes that affect xylan formation.  In this study, we investigate several homologs of one of these previously  identified xylan-related genes, IRX10 from Arabidopsis thaliana, by heterologous  expression and in vitro xylan xylosyltransferase assay. We find that an IRX10  homolog from the moss Physcomitrella patens displays robust activity, and we show  that the xylosidic linkage formed is a beta-1,4 linkage, establishing this protein  as a xylan beta-1,4-xylosyltransferase. We also find lower but reproducible xylan  xylosyltransferase activity with A. thaliana IRX10 and with a homolog from the  dicot plant Plantago ovata, showing that xylan xylosyltransferase activity is  conserved over large evolutionary distance for these proteins.', '2014 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12641', 'Wilkerson']
