Anthocyanins, vital metabolites in plants, are formed by anthocyanidins combined with various monosaccharides, including glucose, rhamnose, and arabinose. Rhamnose contributes greatly to the glycosylation of anthocyanidins. There are two kinds of rhamnose synthase (RS): rhamnose biosynthesis (RHM), and nucleotide-RS/epimerase-reductase (UER1). Nevertheless, no RS isoform was reported to be involved in anthocyanin synthesis. Here, three homologous PhRHM genes, namely PhRHM1, PhRHM2, and PhRHM3, and one PhUER1 gene from petunia were cloned and characterized. Green fluorescent protein fusion protein assays revealed that PhRHMs and PhUER1 are localized in the cytoplasm. We obtained PhRHM1 or/and PhRHM2 or PhUER1 silenced petunia plants and did not attempt to obtain PhRHM3 silenced plants since PhRHM3 mRNA was not detected in petunia organs examined. PhRHM1 and PhRHM2 (PhRHM1-2) silencing induced abnormal plant growth and decreased the contents of l-rhamnose, photosynthetic pigments and total anthocyanins, while PhUER1 silencing did not cause any visible phenotypic changes. Flavonoid metabolome analysis further revealed that PhRHM1-2 silencing reduced the contents of anthocyanins with rhamnose residue. These results revealed that PhRHMs contribute to the biosynthesis of rhamnose and that PhRHMs participate in the anthocyanin rhamnosylation in petunia, while PhUER1 does not.
