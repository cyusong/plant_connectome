The plasma membrane proton gradient is an essential feature of plant cells. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), this gradient is generated by the plasma membrane proton pump encoded by a family of 11 genes (abbreviated as AHA, for Arabidopsis H(+)-ATPase), of which AHA1 and AHA2 are the two most predominantly expressed in seedlings and adult plants. Although double knockdown mutant plants containing T-DNA insertions in both genes are embryonic lethal, under ideal laboratory growth conditions, single knockdown mutant plants with a 50% reduction in proton pump concentration complete their life cycle without any observable growth alteration. However, when grown under conditions that induce stress on the plasma membrane protonmotive force (PMF), such as high external potassium to reduce the electrical gradient or high external pH to reduce the proton chemical gradient, aha2 mutant plants show a growth retardation compared with wild-type plants. In this report, we describe the results of studies that examine in greater detail AHA2's specific role in maintaining the PMF during seedling growth. By comparing the wild type and aha2 mutants, we have measured the effects of a reduced PMF on root and hypocotyl growth, ATP-induced skewed root growth, and rapid cytoplasmic calcium spiking. In addition, genome-wide gene expression profiling revealed the up-regulation of potassium transporters in aha2 mutants, indicating, as predicted, a close link between the PMF and potassium uptake at the plasma membrane. Overall, this characterization of aha2 mutants provides an experimental and theoretical framework for investigating growth and signaling processes that are mediated by PMF-coupled energetics at the cell membrane.
