Nowadays, genetic diversity more than ever represents a key driver of adaptation to climate challenges like drought, heat, and salinity. Therefore, there is a need to replenish the limited elite gene pools with favorable exotic alleles from the wild progenitors of our crops. Nested association mapping (NAM) populations represent one step toward exotic allele evaluation and enrichment of the elite gene pool. We investigated an adaptive selection strategy in the wild barley NAM population HEB-25 based on temporal genomic data by studying the fate of 214,979 SNP loci initially heterozygous in individual BC<sub>1</sub>S<sub>3</sub> lines after five cycles of selfing and field propagation. We identified several loci exposed to adaptive selection in HEB-25. In total, 48.7% (104,725 SNPs) of initially heterozygous SNP calls in HEB-25 were fixed in BC<sub>1</sub>S<sub>3:8</sub> generation, either toward the wild allele (19.9%) or the cultivated allele (28.8%). Most fixed SNP loci turned out to represent gene loci involved in domestication and flowering time as well as plant height, for example, <i>btr1/btr2</i>, <i>thresh-1</i>, <i>Ppd-H1</i>, and <i>sdw1</i>. Interestingly, also unknown loci were found where the exotic allele was fixed, hinting at potentially useful exotic alleles for plant breeding.
