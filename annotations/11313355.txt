['11313355', "The initial step in the de novo biosynthesis of cytokinin in higher plants is the  formation of isopentenyladenosine 5'-monophosphate (iPMP) from AMP and  dimethylallylpyrophosphate (DMAPP), which is catalyzed by adenylate  isopentenyltransferase (IPT). Although cytokinin is an essential hormone for  growth and development, the nature of the enzyme for its biosynthesis in higher  plants has not been identified. Herein, we describe the molecular cloning and  biochemical identification of IPTs from Arabidopsis thaliana. Eight cDNAs  encoding putative IPT, designated as AtIPT1 to AtIPT8, were picked up from A.  thaliana. The Escherichia coli transformants expressing the recombinant proteins  excreted cytokinin species into the culture medium except for that expressing  AtIPT2 that is a putative tRNA IPT. A purified recombinant AtIPT1 catalyzed the  formation of iPMP from DMAPP and AMP. These results indicate that the small  multigene family contains both types of isopentenyltransferase, which could  synthesize cytokinin and mature tRNA.", '2001 Jul 13', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M102130200', 'Sugiyama']
