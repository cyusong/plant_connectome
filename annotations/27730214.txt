['27730214', 'Glucosinolates (GSLs) in the plant order of the Brassicales are sulfur-rich  secondary metabolites that harbor antipathogenic and antiherbivory  plant-protective functions and have medicinal properties, such as  carcinopreventive and antibiotic activities. Plants repress GSL biosynthesis upon  sulfur deficiency (-S); hence, field performance and medicinal quality are  impaired by inadequate sulfate supply. The molecular mechanism that links -S to  GSL biosynthesis has remained understudied. We report here the identification of  the -S marker genes sulfur deficiency induced 1 (SDI1) and SDI2 acting as major  repressors controlling GSL biosynthesis in Arabidopsis under -S condition. SDI1  and SDI2 expression negatively correlated with GSL biosynthesis in both  transcript and metabolite levels. Principal components analysis of transcriptome  data indicated that SDI1 regulates aliphatic GSL biosynthesis as part of -S  response. SDI1 was localized to the nucleus and interacted with MYB28, a major  transcription factor that promotes aliphatic GSL biosynthesis, in both yeast and  plant cells. SDI1 inhibited the transcription of aliphatic GSL biosynthetic genes  by maintaining the DNA binding composition in the form of an SDI1-MYB28 complex,  leading to down-regulation of GSL biosynthesis and prioritization of sulfate  usage for primary metabolites under sulfur-deprived conditions.', '2016 Oct', 'Sci Adv', '10.1126/sciadv.1601087', 'Maruyama-Nakashita']
