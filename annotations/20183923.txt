The advantages of environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) make it a suitable technique for studying plant tissue in its native state. There have been few studies on the effects of ESEM environment and beam damage on the viability of plant tissue. A simple plant tissue, Allium cepa (onion) upper epidermal tissue was taken as the model for study. The change of moisture content of samples was studied at different relative humidities. Working with the electron beam on, viability tests were conducted for samples after exposure in the ESEM under different operating conditions to investigate the effect of electron beam dose on the viability of samples. The results suggested that without the electron beam, the ESEM chamber itself can prevent the loss of initial moisture if its relative humidity is maintained above 90%. With the electron beam on, the viability of Allium cepa (onion) cells depends both on the beam accelerating voltage and the electron dose/unit area hitting the sample. The dose can be controlled by several of the ESEM instrumental parameters. The detailed process of beam damage on cuticle-down and cuticle-up samples was investigated and compared. The results indicate that cuticular adhesion to the cell wall is relatively weak, but highly resistant to electron beam damage. Systematic study on the effect of ESEM operation parameters has been done. Results qualitatively support the intuitive expectations, but demonstrate quantitatively that Allium cepa epidermal cells are able to be kept in a hydrated and viable state under relevant operation condition inside ESEM, providing a basis for further in situ experiments on plant tissues.
