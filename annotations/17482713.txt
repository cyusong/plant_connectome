We have identified a novel gene designated CsV03-3 from Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck that encodes a 50 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 5.4kDa and a pI of 3.7. CsV03-3 expression is up-regulated by application of methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid as well as by abiotic stress and insect herbivory. CsV03-3 belongs to a small gene family consisting of at least three other closely related members (CsV03-1, CsV03-2, and CsV03-4) whose expression is also responsive to phytohormone application and abiotic stress. Sequence similarity searches of the public databases were unsuccessful in finding sequence homologs to CsV03-3 or any CsV03 family member; however, structural prediction models coupled with model comparison to Protein Data Bank folds indicated that the predicted polypeptide encoded by CsV03-3 has structural similarity to proteins with nucleic acid binding activity. Gel mobility shift assays performed on recombinant CsV03-3 protein demonstrated active binding with dsDNA and, to a lesser extent, ssDNA. Based on the phytohormone-inducible expression patterns, the ability to bind nucleic acids, and the lack of significant sequence homology to public databases, we propose that CsV03-3 and its related homologs defines a new class of nucleic acid binding proteins that are responsive to defense and stress signaling in woody perennials.
