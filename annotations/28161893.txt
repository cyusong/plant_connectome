Photosystem I (PSI) is the most efficient bioenergetic nanomachine in nature and one of the largest membrane protein complexes known. It is composed of 18 protein subunits that bind more than 200 co-factors and prosthetic groups. While the structure and function of PSI have been studied in great detail, very little is known about the PSI assembly process. In this work, we have characterized a PSI assembly intermediate in tobacco plants, which we named PSI*. We found PSI* to contain only a specific subset of the core subunits of PSI. PSI* is particularly abundant in young leaves where active thylakoid biogenesis takes place. Moreover, PSI* was found to overaccumulate in PsaF-deficient mutant plants, and we show that re-initiation of PsaF synthesis promotes the maturation of PSI* into PSI. The attachment of antenna proteins to PSI also requires the transition from PSI* to mature PSI. Our data could provide a biochemical entry point into the challenging investigation of PSI biogenesis and allow us to improve the model for the assembly pathway of PSI in thylakoid membranes of vascular plants.
