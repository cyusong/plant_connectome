Trichomes are specialized epidermal appendages that serve as excellent models to study cell morphogenesis. Although the molecular mechanism underlying trichome morphogenesis in Arabidopsis has been well characterized, most of the regulators essential for multicellular trichome morphology remain unknown in tomato. In this study, we determined that the recessive hairless-2 (hl-2) mutation in tomato causes severe distortion of all trichome types, along with increased stem fragility. Using map-based cloning, we found that the hl-2 phenotype was associated with a 100 bp insertion in the coding region of Nck-associated protein 1, a component of the SCAR/WAVE complex. Direct protein-protein interaction was detected between Hl-2 and Hl (SRA1, specifically Rac1-associated protein) using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting that these proteins may work together during trichome formation. In addition, knock-down of a HD-Zip IV transcription factor, HDZIPIV8, distorted trichomes similar to the hl-2 mutant. HDZIPIV8 regulates the expression of Hl-2 by binding to the L1-box in the Hl-2 promoter region, and is involved in organizing actin filaments. The brittleness of hl-2 stems was found to result from decreased cellulose content. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Hl-2 gene plays an important role in controlling multicellular trichome morphogenesis and mechanical properties of stems in tomato plants.
