Plants have evolved diverse molecular mechanisms that enable them to respond to a wide range of pathogens. It has become clear that microRNAs, a class of short single-stranded RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-translational level, play a crucial role in coordinating plant-pathogen interactions. Specifically, miRNAs have been shown to be involved in the regulation of phytohormone signals, reactive oxygen species, and <i>NBS-LRR</i> gene expression, thereby modulating the arms race between hosts and pathogens. Adding another level of complexity, it has recently been shown that specific lncRNAs (ceRNAs) can act as decoys that interact with and modulate the activity of miRNAs. Here we review recent findings regarding the roles of miRNA in plant defense, with a focus on the regulatory modes of miRNAs and their possible applications in breeding pathogen-resistance plants including crops and trees. Special emphasis is placed on discussing the role of miRNA in the arms race between hosts and pathogens, and the interaction between disease-related miRNAs and lncRNAs.
