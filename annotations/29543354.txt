The concentrations of sugars in fruit vary with fruit development, environment and genotype. In general, there were weak correlations between the variations in sugar concentrations and the activities of enzymes directly related with the synthesis or degradation of sugars. This finding suggests that the relationships between enzyme activities and metabolites are often non-linear and are difficult to assess. To simulate the concentrations of sucrose, glucose, fructose and sorbitol during the development of peach fruit, a kinetic model of sugar metabolism was developed by taking advantage of recent profiling data. Cell compartmentation (cytosol and vacuole) was described explicitly, and data-driven enzyme activities were used to parameterize equations. The model correctly accounts for both annual and genotypic variations, which were observed in 10 genotypes derived from an interspecific cross. They provided important information on the mechanisms underlying the specification of phenotypic differences. In particular, the model supports the hypothesis that a difference in fructokinase affinity could be responsible for a low fructose-to-glucose ratio phenotype, which was observed in the studied population.
