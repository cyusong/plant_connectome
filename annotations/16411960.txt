This work tested the hypothesis that ectomycorrhizas (EM) of Dicymbe corymbosa alter leaf-litter decomposition and residual litter quality in tropical forests of Guyana. Mass loss of leaf litter in litter bags was determined on three occasions, in two experiments, during a 12-month period. Paired root-exclusion plots were located randomly within a D. corymbosa forest. Both D. corymbosa and mixed-species leaf litters were reciprocally transplanted into their respective forest types. Elemental analysis was performed on the residual D. corymbosa leaf litter after 1 yr. Leaf litter mass loss in the D. corymbosa forest was not influenced by EM, despite high EM colonization. Elemental analysis of D. corymbosa leaf litter residues demonstrated reduced calcium levels in the presence of EM, which were negatively correlated with EM rootlet-colonizing mass. The lack of EM effect on the litter decomposition rate, coupled with high EM colonization, suggests an important but indirect role in mineral nutrient acquisition. Lowered Ca concentration in leaf litter exposed to EM may suggest a high Ca demand by the ectotroph system.
