Rice grain size and weight are major determinants of grain quality and yield and so have been under rigorous selection since domestication. However, the genetic basis for contrasting grain size/weight trait among Indian germplasms and their association with domestication-driven evolution is not well understood. In this study, two long (LGG) and two short grain (SGG) genotypes were resequenced. LGG (LGR and PB 1121) differentiated from SGG (Sonasal and Bindli) by 504 439 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 78 166 insertion-and-deletion polymorphisms. The LRK gene cluster was different and a truncation mutation in the LRK8 kinase domain was associated with LGG. Phylogeny with 3000 diverse rice accessions revealed that the four sequenced genotypes belonged to the japonica group and were at the edge of the clades indicating them to be the potential source of genetic diversity available in Indian rice germplasm. Six SNPs were significantly associated with grain size/weight and the top four of these could be validated in mapping a population, suggesting this study as a valuable resource for high-throughput genotyping. A contiguous long low-diversity region (LDR) of approximately 6 Mb carrying a major grain weight quantitative trait loci (harbouring OsTOR gene) was identified on Chromosome 5. This LDR was identified as an evolutionary important site with significant positive selection and multiple selection sweeps, and showed association with many domestication-related traits, including grain size/weight. The aus population retained more allelic variations in the LDR than the japonica and indica populations, suggesting it to be one of the divergence loci. All the data and analyses can be accessed from the RiceSzWtBase database.
