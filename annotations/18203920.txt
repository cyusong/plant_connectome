['18203920', 'The GNOM protein plays a fundamental role in Arabidopsis thaliana development by  regulating endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking required for polar  localization of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1. GNOM is a family member of large  ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors (ARF-GEFs), which regulate vesicle  formation by activating ARF GTPases on specific membranes in animals, plants, and  fungi. However, apart from the catalytic exchange activity of the SEC7 domain,  the functional significance of other conserved domains is virtually unknown.  Here, we show that a distinct N-terminal domain of GNOM mediates dimerization and  in addition interacts heterotypically with two other conserved domains in vivo.  In contrast with N-terminal dimerization, the heterotypic interaction is  essential for GNOM function, as mutations abolishing this interaction inactivate  the GNOM protein and compromise its membrane association. Our results suggest a  general model of large ARF-GEF function in which regulated changes in protein  conformation control membrane association of the exchange factor and, thus,  activation of ARFs.', '2008 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.056515', 'Jurgens']
