Resistance to the defoliating pathotype of <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> has been evaluated in a pool of 68 wild genotypes of olive belonging to the SILVOLIVE collection. Resistance was evaluated by assessing symptom severity using a 0-4 rating scale, estimating the relative area under the disease progress curve (RAUDPC), determining the percentage of dead plants (PDP), and measuring the evolution of morphological parameters in inoculated plants over time. In addition, the density levels of <i>V. dahliae</i> in the stem of root-inoculated genotypes have been quantified by means of quantitative real-time PCR at 35 and 120 days after inoculation (dai). Fifteen genotypes (22%) were cataloged as resistant to <i>V. dahliae</i> (i.e., disease parameters did not significantly differ from those of the resistant cultivar Frantoio, or were even lower). Resistant genotypes are characterized by presenting fewer symptoms and a lower amount of <i>V. dahliae</i> DNA at 120 dai than at 35 dai, indicating their ability to control the disease and reduce the density of the pathogen. The rest of the evaluated genotypes showed variable levels of susceptibility. Overall analysis of all genotypes showed high correlation between symptomatology and the amount of <i>V. dahliae</i> DNA in the stem of inoculated genotypes at 120 dai, rather than at 35 dai. However, correlation at 120 dai was not observed in the set of resistant genotypes, suggesting that resistance to defoliating <i>V. dahliae</i> in olive is based on the occurrence of different mechanisms such as avoidance or tolerance. These mechanisms are valuable for designing breeding programs and for the identification of target genes and resistant rootstocks to better control Verticillium wilt in the olive grove.
