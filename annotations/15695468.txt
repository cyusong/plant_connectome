['15695468', 'Sphingoid long-chain base (LCB) kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of LCBs to  form LCB 1-phosphates. Based on sequence identity to murine sphingosine kinase  (mSPHK1), we cloned and characterized the first plant LCB kinase gene from  Arabidopsis (AtLCBK1). Using recombinant AtLCBK1 protein from Escherichia coli  cells, we confirmed that the enzyme specifically phosphorylated  D-erythro-dihydrosphingosine (DHS), but not N-acetyl-DHS or D-threo-DHS. AtLCBK1  also phosphorylated D-erythro-sphingosine, trans-4, trans-8-sphingadienine and  phytosphingosine. We found that AtLCBK1 mRNA is highly expressed in flowers.  AtLCBK1 transcripts were slightly increased by low humidity or abscisic acid  treatments, suggesting that AtLCBK1 is constitutively expressed under these  treatments.', '2005 Feb', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pci023', 'Nishiura']
