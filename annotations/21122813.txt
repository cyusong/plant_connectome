['21122813', 'BACKGROUND: Low inorganic phosphate (Pi) availability triggers metabolic  responses to maintain the intracellular phosphate homeostasis in plants. One  crucial adaptive mechanism is the immediate cleavage of Pi from phosphorylated  substrates; however, phosphohydrolases that function in the cytosol and putative  substrates have not been characterized yet. One candidate gene is Arabidopsis  thaliana At1g73010 encoding an uncharacterized enzyme with homology to the  haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. METHODS AND RESULTS: This work reports  the molecular cloning of At1g73010, its expression in Escherichia coli, and the  enzymatic characterisation of the recombinant protein (33.5 kD). The  Mg(2)(+)-dependent enzyme named AtPPsPase1 catalyzes the specific cleavage of  pyrophosphate (K(m) 38.8 muM) with an alkaline catalytic pH optimum. Gel  filtration revealed a tetrameric structure of the soluble cytoplasmic protein.  Modelling of the active site and assay of the recombinant protein variant D19A  demonstrated that the enzyme shares the catalytic mechanism of the HAD  superfamily including a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate. CONCLUSIONS: The  tight control of AtPPsPase1 gene expression underlines its important role in the  Pi starvation response and suggests that cleavage of pyrophosphate is an  immediate metabolic adaptation reaction. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The novel enzyme,  the first pyrophosphatase in the HAD superfamily, differs from classical  pyrophosphatases with respect to structure and catalytic mechanism. The enzyme  function could be used to discover unknown aspects of pyrophosphate metabolism in  general.', '2011 Feb', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2010.11.006', 'Kock']
