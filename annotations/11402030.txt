['11402030', 'Previously, we characterized a mitochondrial co-chaperonin (Cpn10) and a  chloroplast co-chaperonin (Cpn20) from Arabidopsis thaliana (Koumoto, Y.,  Tsugeki, R., Shimada, T., Mori, H., Kondo, M., Hara-Nishimura, I., and Nishimura,  M. (1996) Plant J. 10, 1119-1125; Koumoto, Y., Shimada, T., Kondo, M., Takao, T.,  Shimonishi, Y., Hara-Nishimura, I., and Nishimura, M. (1999) Plant J. 17,  467-477). Here, we report a third co-chaperonin. The cDNA was 603 base pairs  long, encoding a protein of 139 amino acids. From a sequence analysis, the  protein was predicted to have one Cpn10 domain with an amino-terminal extension  that might work as a chloroplast transit peptide. This novel Cpn10 was confirmed  to be localized in chloroplasts, and we refer to it as chloroplast Cpn10  (chl-Cpn10). The phylogenic tree that was generated with amino acid sequences of  other co-chaperonins indicates that chl-Cpn10 is highly divergent from the  others. In the GroEL-assisted protein folding assay, about 30% of the substrates  were refolded with chl-Cpn10, indicating that chl-Cpn10 works as a co-chaperonin.  A Northern blot analysis revealed that mRNA for chl-Cpn10 is accumulated in the  leaves and stems, but not in the roots. In germinating cotyledons, the  accumulation of chl-Cpn10 was similar to that of chloroplastic proteins and  accelerated by light. It was proposed that two kinds of co-chaperonins, Cpn20 and  chl-Cpn10, work independently in the chloroplast.', '2001 Aug 10', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M102330200', 'Nishimura']
