Abiotic stress tolerance is an intricate feature controlled through several genes and networks in the plant system. In abiotic stress, salt, and drought are well known to limit cotton productivity. Transcriptomics meta-analysis has arisen as a robust method to unravel the stress-responsive molecular network in crops. In order to understand drought and salt stress tolerance mechanisms, a meta-analysis of transcriptome studies is crucial. To confront these issues, here, we have given details of genes and networks associated with significant differential expression in response to salt and drought stress. The key regulatory hub genes of drought and salt stress conditions have notable associations with functional drought and salt stress-responsive (DSSR) genes. In the network study, nodulation signaling pathways 2 (<i>NSP2)</i>, Dehydration-responsive element1 D (<i>DRE1D</i>), ethylene response factor (<i>ERF61</i>), cycling DOF factor 1 (<i>CDF1</i>), and tubby like protein 3 (<i>TLP3</i>) genes in drought and tubby like protein 1 (<i>TLP1</i>), thaumatin-like proteins (<i>TLP</i>), ethylene-responsive transcription factor ERF109 (<i>EF109</i>), ETS-Related transcription Factor (<i>ELF4</i>), and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> homeodomain leucine-zipper gene (<i>ATHB7</i>) genes in salt showed the significant putative functions and pathways related to providing tolerance against drought and salt stress conditions along with the significant expression values. These outcomes provide potential candidate genes for further in-depth functional studies in cotton, which could be useful for the selection of an improved genotype of <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> against drought and salt stress conditions.
