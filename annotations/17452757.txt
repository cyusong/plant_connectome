Tomato texture is one of the critical components for the consumer's perception of fruit quality. Texture is a complex character composed of several attributes that are difficult to evaluate and which change during fruit ripening. This study investigated the texture of tomato fruits at the rheological, sensory, morphological, and genetic levels, and attempted to correlate several parameters. Analyses were performed on tomato fruits from introgressed lines carrying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with texture traits localized on different chromosomes, in two genetic backgrounds. Rheological measurements were used to determine resistance to deformation and fruit elasticity. Sensory analysis was used to assess flesh firmness, juiciness, mealiness, and skin toughness. Image analysis was used to study fruit morphology and to define the cellular structure and heterogeneity of the pericarp. A highly significant correlation was observed between instrumental and sensory firmness. Moreover, correlations were also established between some texture traits and parameters of the pericarp cellular structure. Compared with QTLs detected in a previous study, the phenotypic effects expected for mealiness were confirmed in all lines, whereas, for firmness, they were not confirmed. Significant interactions between QTL and genetic background were observed for several traits. In addition, kinetic analysis showed that differences in firmness occurred from the early stages of fruit development. These results provide both a broad description of texture components and preliminary information to understand their genetic control.
