In traditional medicine, different parts of plants, including fruits, have been used for their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. Plant-based foods, such as fruits, seeds and vegetables, are used for therapeutic purposes due to the presence of flavonoid compounds. Proanthocyanidins (PCs) and anthocyanins (ACNs) are the major distributed flavonoid pigments in plants, which have therapeutic potential against certain chronic diseases. PCs and ACNs derived from plant-based foods and/or medicinal plants at different nontoxic concentrations have shown anti-non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) activity in vitro/in vivo models through inhibiting proliferation, invasion/migration, metastasis and angiogenesis and by activating apoptosis/autophagy-related mechanisms. However, the potential mechanisms by which these compounds exert efficacy against nicotine-induced NSCLC are not fully understood. Thus, this review aims to gain insights into the mechanisms of action and therapeutic potential of PCs and ACNs in nicotine-induced NSCLC.

ACNs: !inhibit! NSCLC
PCs/ACNs: !activate! Apoptosis/Autophagy
