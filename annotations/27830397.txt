Two subtilisin-like proteases show highly specific and complementary expression patterns in developing grains. These genes label the complete surface of the filial-maternal interface, suggesting a role in filial epithelial differentiation. The cereal endosperm is the most important source of nutrition and raw materials for mankind, as well as the storage compartment enabling initial growth of the germinating plantlets. The development of the different cell types in this tissue is regulated environmentally, genetically and epigenetically, resulting in the formation of top-bottom, adaxial-abaxial and surface-central axes. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions among the different inputs are mostly unknown. We have screened a kernel cDNA library for tissue-specific transcripts as initial step to identify genes relevant in cell differentiation. We report here on the isolation of two maize subtilisin-related genes that show grain-specific, surficial expression. zmsbt1 (Zea mays Subtilisin1) is expressed at the developing aleurone in a time-regulated manner, while zmsbt2 concentrates at the pedicel in front of the endosperm basal transfer layer. We have shown that their presence, early in the maize caryopsis development, is dependent on proper initial tissue determination, and have isolated their promoters to produce transgenic reporter lines that assist in the study of their regulation.
