Nitrogen (N) is one of the primary macronutrients required for crop growth and yield. This nutrient is especially limiting in the dry and low fertility soils where pearl millet [<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i> (L.) R. Br] is typically grown. Globally, pearl millet is the sixth most important cereal grown by subsistence farmers in the arid and semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Most of these agro-ecologies have low N in the root zone soil strata. Therefore, there is an immense need to identify lines that use nitrogen efficiently. A set of 380 diverse pearl millet lines consisting of a global diversity panel (345), parents of mapping populations (20), and standard checks (15) were evaluated in an alpha-lattice design with two replications, 25 blocks, a three-row plot for 11 nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) related traits across three growing seasons (Summer 2017, Rainy 2017, and Summer 2018) in an N-depleted precision field under three different N levels (0%-N<sub>0</sub>, 50%-N<sub>50</sub>, 100%-N<sub>100</sub> of recommended N, i.e., 100 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>). Analysis of variance revealed significant genetic variation for NUE-related traits across treatments and seasons. Nitrogen in limited condition (N<sub>0</sub>) resulted in a 27.6 and 17.6% reduction in grain yield (GY) and dry stover yield (DSY) compared to N<sub>50</sub>. Higher reduction in GY and DSY traits by 24.6 and 23.6% were observed under N<sub>0</sub> compared to N<sub>100</sub>. Among the assessed traits, GY exhibited significant positive correlations with nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUtE) and nitrogen harvest index (NHI). This indicated the pivotal role of N remobilization to the grain in enhancing yield levels. Top 25 N-insensitive (NIS-top grain yielders) and N-sensitive (NS-poor grain yielders) genotypes were identified under low N conditions. Out of 25 NIS lines, nine genotypes (IP 10820, IP 17720, ICMB 01222-P1, IP 10379, ICMB 89111-P2, IP 8069, ICMB 90111-P2, ICMV IS89305, and ICMV 221) were common with the top 25 lines for N<sub>100</sub> level showing the genotype plasticity toward varying N levels. Low N tolerant genotypes identified from the current investigation may help in the identification of genomic regions responsible for NUE and its deployment in pearl millet breeding programs through marker-assisted selection (MAS).
