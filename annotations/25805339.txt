Cadmium toxicity is alleviated by iron and manganese supplements because of reduction in cadmium accumulation and upholding of redox regulation that prevent cadmium-inducible damage to root growth and photosynthesis. Cadmium toxicity in Oryza sativa L. MTU 7029 was investigated in the presence of different concentrations of the micronutrients Fe and Mn. It had been observed that these micronutrients reduce Cd uptake and minimize Cd-inducible rhizotoxicity. The photosynthetic electron transport chain, which is the hub of Fe containing metalloproteins, was severely affected by Cd and resulted in reduced bioproductivity under Cd stress. However, exogenous Fe restored the photosynthetic electron transport. Thus, due to the maintenance of the photosynthetic electron transport, the Cd tolerance was improved during Fe supplement. Both antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidant metabolites were found to play important roles in the alleviation of Cd stress under Fe or Mn supplement. It is concluded that the presence of excess Fe and Mn protects rice plants from Cd stress.
