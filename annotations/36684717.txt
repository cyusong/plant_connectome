Biostimulants play an important role in promoting crop growth and development and improving fruit yield, but their influence on fruit quality in horticulture plants is still unclear. In this study, four types of biostimulants, Ainuo (AN), Aigefu (AG), Weiguo (WG), and Guanwu Shuang (GS) were applied to the fruit surface of 'Yinhongli' plum at 60 and 75 days after anthesis to investigate their effect on carbohydrates and biosynthesis of anthocyanins, and also analyze the relationship between sugar and anthocyanin accumulation during fruit color change to ripening. Results showed that all biostimulant treatments significantly improved fruit appearance quality, and increased single fruit weight and TSS/TA. Cyanidin 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside and cyanidin 3-<i>O</i>-rutinoside, are the most important anthocyanins in the red skin of the 'Yinhongli' plum, and no anthocyanin was detected in the green skin. In addition, WG and GS treatments significantly increased the expression of structural genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis compared with the control, especially <i>chalcone synthase (CHS)</i> and <i>flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT)</i> at 95-105 d after anthesis, leading to anthocyanin accumulation 10 days earlier than the control. Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between total sugar and anthocyanin content during fruit coloring and ripening.
