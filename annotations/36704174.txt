Nitrogen(N), phosphorus(P), and potassium(K) are essential elements that are highly deficient during plant growth. Existing diagnostic methods are not suitable for rapid diagnosis of large-scale planting areas. Near-ground remote sensing technology based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and sensor is often applied to crop growth condition monitoring and agricultural management. It has been proven to be used for monitoring plant N, P, and K content. However, its integrated diagnostic model has been less studied. In this study, we collected UAV multispectral images of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. in different periods of nutritional stress and constructed recognition models with different heights and algorithms. The optimal model variables were selected, and the effects of different sampling heights and modeling algorithms on the model efficiency under the time span were evaluated. At the same time, we evaluated the timeliness of the model based on leaf element content determination and SPAD. It was also validated in field crop production. The results showed that the LR algorithm's model had optimal performance at all periods and flight altitudes. The optimal accuracy of N-deficient plants identification reached 100%, P/K-deficient plants reached 92.4%, and normal plants reached 91.7%. The results of UAV multispectral diagnosis, chemical diagnosis, and SPAD value diagnosis were consistent in the diagnosis of N deficiency, and the diagnosis of P and K deficiency was slightly lagging behind that of chemical diagnosis. This research uses UAV remote sensing technology to establish an efficient, fast, and timely nutritional diagnosis method for L. Chuanxiong, which is applied in production. Meanwhile, the standardized production of medicinal plant resources provides new solutions.
