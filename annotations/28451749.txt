This study provides new insights into the biosynthesis regulation and in planta function of the lignan yatein in flax leaves. Pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductases (PLR) catalyze the conversion of pinoresinol into secoisolariciresinol (SECO) in lignan biosynthesis. Several lignans are accumulated in high concentrations, such as SECO accumulated as secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in seeds and yatein in aerial parts, in the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum L.) from which two PLR enzymes of opposite enantioselectivity have been isolated. While LuPLR1 catalyzes the biosynthesis of (+)-SECO leading to (+)-SDG in seeds, the role(s) of the second PLR (LuPLR2) is not completely elucidated. This study provides new insights into the in planta regulation and function of the lignan yatein in flax leaves: its biosynthesis relies on a different PLR with opposite stereospecificity but also on a distinct expression regulation. RNAi technology provided evidence for the in vivo involvement of the LuPLR2 gene in the biosynthesis of (-)-yatein accumulated in flax leaves. LuPLR2 expression in different tissues and in response to stress was studied by RT-qPCR and promoter-reporter transgenesis showing that the spatio-temporal expression of the LuPLR2 gene in leaves perfectly matches the (-)-yatein accumulation and that LuPLR2 expression and yatein production are increased by methyl jasmonate and wounding. A promoter deletion approach yielded putative regulatory elements. This expression pattern in relation to a possible role for this lignan in flax defense is discussed.
