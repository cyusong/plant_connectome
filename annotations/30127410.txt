In the last decade, the view of circadian oscillators has expanded from transcriptional feedback to incorporate post-transcriptional, post-translational, metabolic processes and ionic signalling. In plants and animals, there are circadian oscillations in the concentration of cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>), though their purpose has not been fully characterized. We investigated whether circadian oscillations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> regulate the circadian oscillator of Arabidopsis thaliana. We report that in Arabidopsis, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> circadian oscillations can regulate circadian clock function through the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent action of CALMODULIN-LIKE24 (CML24). Genetic analyses demonstrate a linkage between CML24 and the circadian oscillator, through pathways involving the circadian oscillator gene TIMING OF CAB2 EXPRESSION1 (TOC1).
