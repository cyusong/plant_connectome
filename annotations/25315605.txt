['25315605', 'In all organisms, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) contain numerous modified nucleotides.  For many base modifications in tRNAs, the functional significance is not well  understood, and the enzymes performing the modification reactions are unknown.  Here, we have studied members of a family of putative nucleotide deaminases in  the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We show that two Arabidopsis  genes encoding homologs of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) tRNA adenosine  deaminases catalyze adenosine-to-inosine editing in position 34 of several  cytosolic tRNA species. The encoded proteins (AtTAD2 and AtTAD3, for  tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase) localize to the nucleus and interact with each  other in planta in bimolecular fluorescence complementation and  coimmunoprecipitation assays. Both AtTAD2 and AtTAD3 are encoded by essential  genes whose knockout is lethal and leads to arrested embryo development at the  globular stage. Knockdown mutants for AtTAD2 and AtTAD3 display reduced growth  and inefficient editing from adenosine to inosine in six nucleus-encoded tRNA  species. Moreover, upon comparison of DNA and complementary DNA sequences, we  discovered cytidine-to-uridine RNA editing in position 32 of two nucleus-encoded  serine tRNAs, tRNA-serine(AGA) and tRNA-serine(GCT). This adds a unique type of  RNA editing to the modifications occurring in nuclear genome-encoded RNAs in  plants.', '2014 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.250498', 'ORCID:']
