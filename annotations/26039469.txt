The circadian clock modulates plant responses to environmental stimuli. In a recent study we showed that light and the circadian clock regulate daily changes in sensitivity to short treatments of high UV-B. Here we demonstrate that these time dependent changes in UV-B stress sensitivity are not mediated by the UV-B receptor UV resistantce locus 8. We also discuss the potential mechanisms involved in this process and the role of the circadian clock in the acclimation to UV-B.

Circadian clock: !modulates! Plant responses
Light: !regulates! UV-B sensitivity
UV-B receptor: !not involved in! Time dependent changes
Circadian clock: !involved in! Acclimation to UV-B
