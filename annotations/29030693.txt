The method introduced here to grow F. hygrometrica in high concentrations of D <sub>2</sub> O is an excellent alternative to produce highly deuterated metabolites with broad applications in metabolic studies. Our mass spectrometry experiments strongly indicate the successful incorporation of deuterium into organic compounds. Deuterated metabolites are useful tracers for metabolic studies, yet their wide utilization in research is limited by the multi-step total synthesis required to produce them in the laboratory. Alternatively, deuterated metabolites can be obtained from organisms grown in D<sub>2</sub>O or deuterated nutrients. This approach also has limitations as D<sub>2</sub>O in high concentrations negatively affects the survival of most organisms. Here we report the moss Funaria hygrometrica as an unusual high tolerant to D<sub>2</sub>O in liquid culture. We found that this moss is able to grow in up to 90% D<sub>2</sub>O, a condition lethal for many eukaryotes. Mass spectrometric analyses of F. hygrometrica extracts showed a strong deuteration pattern. The ability to tolerate high concentrations of D<sub>2</sub>O together with the development of a rich molecular toolbox makes F. hygrometrica an ideal system for the production of valuable deuterated metabolites.
