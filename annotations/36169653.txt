Melatonin is a master regulator of diverse biological processes, including plant's abiotic stress responses and tolerance. Despite the extensive information on the role of melatonin in response to abiotic stress, how plants regulate endogenous melatonin content under stressful conditions remains largely unknown. In this study, we computationally mined Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) libraries of salinity-exposed Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa) to identify the most reliable differentially expressed miRNA and its target gene(s). In light of these analyses, we found that miR168a potentially targets a key melatonin biosynthesis gene, namely O-METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (OMT1). Accordingly, molecular and physiochemical evaluations were performed in a separate salinity experiment using contrasting B. rapa genotypes. Then, the association between B. rapa salinity tolerance and changes in measured molecular and physiochemical characteristics was determined. Results indicated that the expression profiles of miR168a and OMT1 significantly differed between B. rapa genotypes. Moreover, the expression profiles of miR168a and OMT1 significantly correlated with more melatonin content, robust antioxidant activities, and better ion homeostasis during salinity stress. Our results suggest that miR168a plausibly mediates melatonin biosynthesis, mainly through the OMT1 gene, under salinity conditions and thereby contributes to the salinity tolerance of B. rapa. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the role of miR168a and OMT1 in B. rapa salinity response.
