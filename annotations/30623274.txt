Methane-triggered lateral root formation is not only a universal event, but also dependent on L-cysteine desulfhydrase-dependent hydrogen sulfide signaling. Whether or how methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) triggers lateral root (LR) formation has not been elucidated. In this report, CH<sub>4</sub> induction of lateral rooting and the role of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) were dissected in tomato and Arabidopsis by using physiological, anatomical, molecular, and genetic approaches. First, we discovered that CH<sub>4</sub> induction of lateral rooting is a universal event. Exogenously applied CH<sub>4</sub> not only triggered tomato lateral rooting, but also increased activities of L-cysteine desulfhydrase (DES; a major synthetic enzyme of H<sub>2</sub>S) and induced endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S production, and contrasting responses were observed in the presence of hypotaurine (HT; a scavenger of H<sub>2</sub>S) or DL-propargylglycine (PAG; an inhibitor of DES) alone. CH<sub>4</sub>-triggered lateral rooting were sensitive to the inhibition of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S with HT or PAG. The changes in the transcripts of representative cell cycle regulatory genes, miRNA and its target genes were matched with above phenotypes. In the presence of CH<sub>4</sub>, Arabidopsis mutant Atdes1 exhibited defects in lateral rooting, compared with the wild-type. Molecular evidence showed that the transcriptional profiles of representative target genes modulated by CH<sub>4</sub> in wild-type plants were impaired in Atdes1 mutant. Overall, our data demonstrate the main branch of the DES-dependent H<sub>2</sub>S signaling cascade in CH<sub>4</sub>-triggered LR formation.
