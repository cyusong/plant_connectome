Edaphic factors such as salinity, sodicity, and drought adversely affect crop productivity, either alone or in combination. Despite soil sodicity being reported as an increasing problem worldwide, limited efforts have been made to address this issue. In the present study, we aimed to generate rice with tolerance to sodicity in conjunction with tolerance to salinity and drought. Using a fusion gene from E. coli coding for trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase (TPSP) under the control of an ABA-inducible promoter, we generated marker-free, high-yielding transgenic rice (in the IR64 background) that can tolerate high pH (~9.9), high EC (~10.0 dS m-1), and severe drought (30-35% soil moisture content). The transgenic plants retained higher relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll content, K+/Na+ ratio, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic efficiency compared to the wild-type under these stresses. Positive correlations between trehalose overproduction and high-yield parameters were observed under drought, saline, and sodic conditions. Metabolic profiling using GC-MS indicated that overproduction of trehalose in leaves differently modulated other metabolic switches, leading to significant changes in the levels of sugars, amino acids, and organic acids in transgenic plants under control and stress conditions. Our findings reveal a novel potential technological solution to tackle multiple stresses under changing climatic conditions.
