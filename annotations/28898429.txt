Salicylic acid (SA) and pipecolic acid (Pip) play important roles in plant immunity. Here we analyzed the roles of transcription factors TGACG-BINDING FACTOR 1 (TGA1) and TGA4 in regulating SA and Pip biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. We quantified the expression levels of SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE DEFICIENT 1 (SARD1) and CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN 60g (CBP60g), which encode two master transcription factors of plant immunity, and the accumulation of SA and Pip in tga1-1 tga4-1 mutant plants. We tested whether SARD1 and CBP60g are direct targets of TGA1 by chromatin immunoprecipitation-polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-PCR). In addition to promoting pathogen-induced SA biosynthesis, we found that SARD1 and CBP60g also positively regulated Pip biosynthesis by targeting genes encoding key biosynthesis enzymes of Pip. TGA1/TGA4 were required for full induction of SARD1 and CBP60g in plant defense. ChIP-PCR analysis showed that SARD1 was a direct target of TGA1. In tga1-1 tga4-1 mutant plants, the expression levels of SARD1 and CBP60g along with SA and Pip accumulation following pathogen infection were dramatically reduced compared with those in wild-type plants. Consistent with reduced expression of SARD1 and CBP60g, pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-induced pathogen resistance and systemic acquired resistance were compromised in tga1-1 tga4-1. Our study showed that TGA1 and TGA4 regulate Pip and SA biosynthesis by modulating the expression of SARD1 and CBP60g.
