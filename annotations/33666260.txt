Guard cell membrane ion transport and metabolism are deeply interconnected, and their coordinated regulation is integral to stomatal opening. Whereas ion transport is exceptionally well understood, how guard cell metabolism influences stomatal movements is less well known. Organic metabolites, such as malate and sugars, fulfill several functions in guard cells during stomatal opening as allosteric activators, counter-ions, energy source and osmolytes. However, their origin and exact fate remain debated. Recent work revealed that the guard cell carbon pool regulating stomatal function and plant growth is mostly of mesophyll origin, highlighting a tight correlation between mesophyll and guard cell metabolism. This review discusses latest research into guard cell carbon metabolism and its impact on stomatal function and whole plant physiology.

Mesophyll: !supplies! Guard cell carbon pool
Guard cell metabolism: !regulates! Stomatal function
Malate and sugars: !fulfill! Several functions in guard cells
Ion transport: !coordinatedly regulated by! Guard cell metabolism
