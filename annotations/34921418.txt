Plant cell surface and intracellular immune receptors recognizing pathogen attack utilize the same defense machineries to mobilize resistance. New genetic, protein structural and biochemical information on receptor activation and signaling is transforming understanding of how their shared defense network operates. We discuss the biochemical activities of two classes of intracellular nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor - one forming a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, the other an NADase enzyme - which define engagement of enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1)-family heterodimers and cofunctioning helper NLRs (RNLs) to connect receptor systems and amplify defenses. Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain NLR receptors and TIR-domain proteins, with a capacity to produce NAD+-derived small molecules, require EDS1 dimers and RNLs for defense induction. The TIR-driven EDS1/RNL modules emerge as central elements in Ca<sup>2+</sup> -based immunity signaling initiated by receptors outside and inside host cells.
