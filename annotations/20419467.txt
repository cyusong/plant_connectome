Zinc is essential for normal plant growth and development. To understand its transport in rice, we characterized OsZIP5, which is inducible under Zn deficiency. OsZIP5 complemented the growth defect of a yeast Zn-uptake mutant, indicating that OsZIP5 is a Zn transporter. The OsZIP5-GFP fusion protein was localized to the plasma membrane. Transgenic plants overexpressing the gene grew less well. Overexpression of the gene decreased the Zn concentration in shoots, but caused it to rise in the roots. Knockout plants showed no visible phenotypic changes under either normal or deficient conditions. However, they were tolerant to excess Zn and contained less Zn. In contrast, overexpressing transgenics were sensitive to excess Zn. These results indicate that OsZIP5 plays a role in Zn distribution within rice.
