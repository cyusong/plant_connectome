Pollen grains can be dispersed singly or variously aggregated in groups. Whether the evolution of pollen aggregation is driven by the pollinator remains unexplored. We hypothesize that an extensive pollen aggregation is favored under a scarcity of pollinators. Variation in pollen aggregation by viscin threads in 13 Rhododendron species was measured as it is related to pollen removal in a visit. Visitation rates of functional pollinator groups that vary in their grooming behavior were investigated in each species. Pollen deposited on stigmas in the field was also sampled. Seven Rhododendron species were infrequently pollinated by low-intensity grooming animals, including birds, butterflies and moths. The other six species were more frequently pollinated by bees with a high intensity of pollen grooming. Bird- and Lepidoptera-pollinated species produced longer pollen-connecting threads that connected more pollen grains. Phylogenetically independent contrast analysis of the 13 species showed that pollinator visitation frequency was negatively related to amounts of pollen removal per visit but not to stigmatic pollen loads. The finding of interspecific patterns in pollen removal related to pollinator visitation frequency suggests pollinator-mediated selection on pollen packaging strategies, supporting the hypothesis of floral evolution via pollen export.
