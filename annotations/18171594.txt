Different methods were tested for the extraction of proteins from the cell wall-enriched fraction (CWEf) obtained from a sample formed by skin and seeds of ripe berries of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon. The CWEf was isolated using a disruptive approach that involves tissue homogenization and precipitation by centrifugation. To extract proteins, the CWEf was treated with CaCl(2) and LiCl in two successive steps or, alternatively, with phenol. The efficiency of the protocols was evaluated by measuring protein yield and by analyzing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) gels for the highest detectable spot number and the greatest spot resolution. The phenol method was also adopted for the extraction of proteins from the cytosolic fraction (CYf). The comparison of 2-DE reference maps of protein extracts from CWEf and CYf indicated the presence of both common traits and unique characteristics. To survey this aspect some spots detected in both fractions or present in only one fraction were analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Of the 47 spots identified, some were found to be cell wall proteins, while others were proteins not traditionally considered as localized in the apoplastic space. The data presented here provide initial information regarding the apoplastic proteome of grape berry tissues, but also raise the issue of the technical problems that characterize the isolation of cell wall proteins from these very hardy tissues.
