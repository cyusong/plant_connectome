['31262954', 'Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for all living organisms and limits  plant growth. Four proteins comprising a single SYG1/Pho81/XPR1 (SPX) domain,  SPX1 to SPX4, are putative phosphate-dependent inhibitors of Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1), the master  transcriptional activator of phosphate starvation responses. This work  demonstrated that SPX4 functions as a negative regulator not only of  PHR1-dependent but also of PHR1-independent responses in P-replete plants.  Transcriptomes of P-limited spx4 revealed that, unlike SPX1 and SPX2, SPX4  modulates the shoot phosphate starvation response but not short-term recovery  after phosphate resupply. In roots, transcriptional regulation of P status is  SPX4 independent. Genes misregulated in spx4 shoots intersect with both  PHR1-dependent and PHOSPHATE2-dependent signaling networks associated with plant  development, senescence, and ion/metabolite transport. Gene regulatory network  analyses suggested that SPX4 interacts with transcription factors other than  PHR1, such as SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 and ARABIDOPSIS NAC  DOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN55, known regulators of shoot development. Transient  expression studies in protoplasts indicated that PHR1 retention in the cytosol by  SPX4 occurs in a dose- and P-status-dependent manner. Using a luciferase reporter  in vivo, SPX4 expression kinetics and stability revealed that SPX4 is a  short-lived protein with P-status-dependent turnover. SPX4 protein levels were  quickly restored by phosphate resupply to P-limited plants. Unlike its monocot  ortholog, AtSPX4 was not stabilized by the phosphate analog phosphite, implying  that intracellular P status is sensed by its SPX domain via phosphate-rich  metabolite signals.', '2019 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.18.00594', 'ORCID:']
