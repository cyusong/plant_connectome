Vascular tissues are surrounded by an apoplastic barrier formed by endodermis that is vital for selective absorption of water and nutrients. Lignification and suberization of endodermal cell walls are fundamental processes in establishing the apoplastic barrier. Endodermal suberization in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots is presumed to be the integration of developmental regulation and stress responses. In root endodermis, the suberization level is enhanced when the Casparian strip, the lignified structure, is defective. However, it is not entirely clear how lignification and suberization interplay and how they interact with stress signaling. Here, in Arabidopsis, we constructed a hierarchical network mediated by SHORT-ROOT (SHR), a master regulator of endodermal development, and identified 13 key MYB transcription factors (TFs) that form multiple sub-networks. Combined with functional analyses, we further uncovered MYB TFs that mediate feedback or feed-forward loops, thus balancing lignification and suberization in Arabidopsis roots. In addition, sub-networks comprising nine MYB TFs were identified that interact with abscisic acid signaling to integrate stress response and root development. Our data provide insights into the mechanisms that enhance plant adaptation to changing environments.
