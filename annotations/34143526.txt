Millions of people are anemic due to inadequate consumption of foods rich in iron and zinc. Plant-based foods provide most of our dietary nutrients but may also contain the toxic heavy metal cadmium (Cd). A low level of Cd silently enters the body through the diet. Once ingested, Cd may remain for decades. Hence, prolonged intake of Cd-containing foods endangers human health. Research that leads towards micronutrient enrichment and mitigation of Cd in foods has therefore dual significance for human health. The breeding of Cd-tolerant cultivars may enable them to grow on Cd-polluted soils; however, they may not yield Cd-free foods. Conversely, sequestration of Cd in roots can prevent its accumulation in grains, but this mechanism also retains nutrients, hence counteracting biofortification efforts. A specific restriction of the Cd absorption capacity of crops would prevent Cd entry into the plant system while maintaining micronutrient accumulation and may thus be a solution to the dilemma. After recapitulating existing strategies employed for the development of Cd-tolerant and biofortified cultivars, this Viewpoint elaborates alternative approaches based on directed evolution and genome editing strategies for excluding Cd while enriching micronutrients in plant foods, which will concurrently help to eradicate malnutrition and prevent Cd intoxication.
