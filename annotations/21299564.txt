['21299564', 'Light regulates Arabidopsis seed germination through the phyB/PIL5 (PHYTOCHROME  INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE 5) transduction pathway, and we have previously shown  that the Dof transcription factor DOF AFFECTING GERMINATION1 (DAG1) is a  component of this pathway. By means of microarray analysis of dag1 and wild type  developing siliques, we identified the EARLY LIGHT-INDUCED PROTEIN1 and 2 (ELIP1  and ELIP2) genes among those deregulated in the loss-of-function dag1 mutant. We  analysed seed germination of elip single and double mutants, of elip dag1 double  mutants as well as of elip1 elip2 dag1 triple mutant under different  environmental conditions. We show that ELIP1 and ELIP2 are involved in opposite  ways in the control of this developmental process, in particular under abiotic  (light, temperature, salt) stress conditions.', '2011 Jun', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03637.x', 'Vittorioso']
