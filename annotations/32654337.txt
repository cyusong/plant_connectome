Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae uses several type III secretion system (T3SS) secreted effectors, namely XopN, XopQ, XopX and XopZ, to suppress rice immune responses that are induced following treatment with cell wall degrading enzymes. Here we show that a T3SS secreted effector XopX interacts with two of the eight rice 14-3-3 proteins. Mutants of XopX that are defective in 14-3-3 binding are also defective in suppression of immune responses, suggesting that interaction with 14-3-3 proteins is required for suppression of host innate immunity. However, Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of both XopQ and XopX into rice cells results in induction of rice immune responses. These immune responses are not observed when either protein is individually delivered into rice cells. XopQ-XopX-induced rice immune responses are not observed with a XopX mutant that is defective in 14-3-3 binding. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation assays indicate that XopQ and XopX interact with each other. A screen for Xanthomonas effectors that can suppress XopQ-XopX-induced rice immune responses led to the identification of five effectors, namely XopU, XopV, XopP, XopG and AvrBs2, that could individually suppress these immune responses. These results suggest a complex interplay of Xanthomonas T3SS effectors in suppression of both pathogen-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity to promote virulence on rice.
