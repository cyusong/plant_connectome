['10381874', 'Ethylene regulates plant growth, development, and responsiveness to a variety of  stresses. Cloning of the Arabidopsis EIN2 gene identifies a central component of  the ethylene signaling pathway. The amino-terminal integral membrane domain of  EIN2 shows similarity to the disease-related Nramp family of metal-ion  transporters. Expression of the EIN2 CEND is sufficient to constitutively  activate ethylene responses and restores responsiveness to jasmonic acid and  paraquat-induced oxygen radicals to mutant plants. EIN2 is thus recognized as a  molecular link between previously distinct hormone response pathways. Plants may  use a combinatorial mechanism for assessing various stresses by enlisting a  common set of signaling molecules.', '1999 Jun 25', 'Science', '10.1126/science.284.5423.2148', 'Ecker']
