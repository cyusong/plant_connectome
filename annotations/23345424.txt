['23345424', 'The Arabidopsis gene OSD1 (Omission of the Second Division) and its homolog UVI4  (UV-B-Insensitive 4) are negative regulators of anaphase-promoting  complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a multisubunit ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates the  progression of cell cycles. Here we report the isolation of an activation tagging  allele of OSD1 as an enhancer of a mutant of BON1 (BONZAI1), a negative regulator  of plant immunity. Overexpression of OSD1 and UVI4 each leads to enhanced  immunity to a bacterial pathogen, which is associated with increased expression  of disease resistance (R) genes similar to the animal NOD1 receptor-like immune  receptor genes. In addition, the reduction of function of one subunit of the APC  complex APC10 exhibited a similar phenotype to that of overexpression of OSD1 or  UVI4, indicating that altered APC function induces immune responses. Enhanced  immune response induced by OSD1 overexpression is dependent on CYCB1;1, which is  a degradation target of APC/C. It is also associated with up-regulation of R  genes and is dependent on the R gene SNC1 (Suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive 1).  Taken together, our findings reveal an unexpected link between cell cycle  progression and plant immunity, suggesting that cell cycle misregulation could  have an impact on expression of genes, including R genes, in plant immunity.', '2013 Feb 5', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1217024110', 'Hua']
