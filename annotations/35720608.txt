As a friendly plant growth regulator to the environment, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has been widely used in plant production, such as fruit coloration, stress resistance, and so on. Previous studies have identified some genes that have a function in the anthocyanin accumulation induced by ALA. However, the regulatory mechanism has not been well revealed. In the current study, we proposed that an ALA-responsive transcription factor, MdERF78, regulated anthocyanin accumulation. <i>MdERF78</i>, overexpressed in apple peels or calli, resulted in a significant increase of anthocyanins, while <i>MdERF78</i> interference had an opposite trend. Furthermore, the anthocyanin accumulation induced by <i>MdERF78</i> overexpression was enhanced by exogenous ALA treatment, suggesting that MdERF78 was involved in the ALA-induced anthocyanin accumulation. Yeast one-hybrid and dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that MdERF78 bound to the promoters of <i>MdF3H</i> and <i>MdANS</i> directly and activated their expressions. Additionally, MdERF78 interacted with MdMYB1 and enhanced the transcriptional activity of MdMYB1 to its target gene promoters. Based on these, it can be concluded that MdERF78 has a positive function in ALA-induced anthocyanin accumulation via the MdERF78-<i>MdF3Hpro</i>/<i>MdANSpro</i> and MdERF78-MdMYB1-<i>MdDFRpro/MdUFGTpro/MdGSTF12pro</i> regulatory network. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanism of ALA-promoted anthocyanin accumulation.
