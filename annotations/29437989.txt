Photosynthesis occurs in the thylakoid membrane, where the predominant lipid is monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). As environmental conditions change, photosynthetic membranes have to adjust. In this study, we used a loss-of-function <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> mutant deficient in the MGDG-specific lipase PGD1 (PLASTID GALACTOGLYCEROLIPID DEGRADATION1) to investigate the link between MGDG turnover, chloroplast ultrastructure, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to different adverse environmental conditions. The <i>pgd1</i> mutant showed altered MGDG abundance and acyl composition and altered abundance of photosynthesis complexes, with an increased PSII/PSI ratio. Transmission electron microscopy showed hyperstacking of the thylakoid grana in the <i>pgd1</i> mutant. The mutant also exhibited increased ROS production during N deprivation and high light exposure. Supplementation with bicarbonate or treatment with the photosynthetic electron transport blocker DCMU protected the cells against oxidative stress in the light and reverted chlorosis of <i>pgd1</i> cells during N deprivation. Furthermore, exposure to stress conditions such as cold and high osmolarity induced the expression of <i>PGD1</i>, and loss of <i>PGD1</i> in the mutant led to increased ROS production and inhibited cell growth. These findings suggest that PGD1 plays essential roles in maintaining appropriate thylakoid membrane composition and structure, thereby affecting growth and stress tolerance when cells are challenged under adverse conditions.
