['35817801', 'Diphthamide, a post-translationally modified histidine residue of eukaryotic  TRANSLATION ELONGATION FACTOR2 (eEF2), is the human host cell-sensitizing target  of diphtheria toxin. Diphthamide biosynthesis depends on the 4Fe-4S-cluster  protein Dph1 catalyzing the first committed step, as well as Dph2 to Dph7, in  yeast and mammals. Here we show that diphthamide modification of eEF2 is  conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana and requires AtDPH1. Ribosomal -1  frameshifting-error rates are increased in Arabidopsis dph1 mutants, similar to  yeast and mice. Compared to the wild type, shorter roots and smaller rosettes of  dph1 mutants result from fewer formed cells. TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase  activity is attenuated, and autophagy is activated, in dph1 mutants. Under  abiotic stress diphthamide-unmodified eEF2 accumulates in wild-type seedlings,  most strongly upon heavy metal excess, which is conserved in human cells. In  summary, our results suggest that diphthamide contributes to the functionality of  the translational machinery monitored by plants to regulate growth.', '2022 Jul 11', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-022-31712-7', 'ORCID:']
