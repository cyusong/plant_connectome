We recently revealed that cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 18 (CNGC18) functioned as the main Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in pollen tube tips for pollen tube guidance to ovules by regulating external Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in Arabidopsis. In this study, we found that the reduction of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ext</sub>) from 10 mM to 5 mM, and further to 2 mM, led to the decreases of pollen germination percentages, but led to the increases of the percentages of ruptured pollen grains and tubes, and branched pollen tubes in vitro in cngc18-17 compared with wild type. The second point mutant allele cngc18-22 showed similar phenotypes, including reduced pollen germination percentages, increased percentages of ruptured pollen tubes, but did not show obvious different percentages of ruptured pollen grains and branched pollen tubes compared with wild type. These data demonstrate that CNGC18 plays essential roles in pollen germination and tube growth as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in Arabidopsis.
