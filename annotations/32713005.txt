Herbivore-induced plant volatiles play important ecological roles in defense against stresses. However, if and which volatile(s) are involved in the plant-plant communication in response to herbivorous insects in tea plants remains unknown. Here, plant-plant communication experiments confirm that volatiles emitted from insects-attacked tea plants can trigger plant resistance and reduce the risk of herbivore damage by inducing jasmonic acid (JA) accumulation in neighboring plants. The emission of six compounds was significantly induced by geometrid Ectropis obliqua, one of the most common pests of the tea plant in China. Among them, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) could induce the accumulation of JA and thus promotes the resistance of neighboring intact plants to herbivorous insects. CsCYP82D47 was identified for the first time as a P450 enzyme, which catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of DMNT from (E)-nerolidol. Down-regulation of CsCYP82D47 in tea plants resulted in a reduced accumulation of DMNT and significantly reduced the release of DMNT in response to the feeding of herbivorous insects. The first evidence for plant-plant communication in response to herbivores in tea plants will help to understand how plants respond to volatile cues in response to herbivores and provide new insight into the role(s) of DMNT in tea plants.
