['24530916', 'Receptor-like kinases are important regulators of many different processes in  plants. Despite their large number only a few have been functionally  characterized. One of the largest subgroups of receptor-like kinases in  Arabidopsis is the cysteine-rich receptor like kinases (CRKs). High sequence  similarity among the CRKs has been suggested as major cause for functional  redundancy. The genomic localization of CRK genes in back-to-back repeats has  made their characterization through mutant analysis unpractical. Expression  profiling has linked the CRKs with reactive oxygen species, important signaling  molecules in plants. Here we have investigated the role of two CRKs, CRK6 and  CRK7, and analyzed their role in extracellular ROS signaling. CRK6 and CRK7 are  active protein kinases with differential preference for divalent cations. Our  results suggest that CRK7 is involved in mediating the responses to extracellular  but not chloroplastic ROS production.', '2014 Mar 7', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.02.013', 'Wrzaczek']
