RNA editing in plant organelles involves numerous C-U conversions, which often restore evolutionarily conserved codons and may generate new translation initiation and termination codons. These RNA maturation events rely on a subset of nuclear-encoded protein cofactors. Here, we provide evidence of the role of SlRIP1b on RNA editing of mitochondrial transcripts in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants. SlRIP1b is a RIP/MORF protein that was originally identified as an interacting partner of the organellar editing factor SlORRM4. Mutants of SlRIP1b, obtained by CRISPR/Cas9 strategy, exhibited abnormal carpel development and grew into fruit with more locules. RNA-sequencing revealed that SlRIP1b affects the C-U editing of numerous mitochondrial pre-RNA transcripts and in particular altered RNA editing of various cytochrome c maturation (CCM)-related genes. The slrip1b mutants display increased H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and aberrant mitochondrial morphologies, which are associated with defects in cytochrome c biosynthesis and assembly of respiratory complex III. Taken together, our results indicate that SlRIP1b is a global editing factor that plays a key role in CCM and oxidative phosphorylation system biogenesis during fruit development in tomato plants. These data provide important insights into the molecular roles of organellar RNA editing factors during fruit development.
