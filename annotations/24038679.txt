['24038679', 'The evolutionarily conserved proteins REI1-LIKE (REIL1) and REIL2 have four  conserved zinc finger domains and are Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of the  cytosolic 60S ribosomal maturation factor Rei1p (for Required for isotropic bud  growth1 protein) from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and its paralog Reh1p (for  REI1 homologue1 protein). The yeast and A. thaliana paralogs result from  independent gene duplications. The A. thaliana REIL paralogs are required  specifically in the cold (10 degrees C) but not for growth at optimal temperature (20 degrees C).  A reil1-1 reil2-1 double mutant is arrested at 10 degrees C prior to the emergence of the  first rosette leaf. Two allelic reil2 mutants, reil2-1 and reil2-2, form small  spoon-shaped leaves at 10 degrees C. This phenomenon reverts after emergence of the  inflorescence in the cold or upon shift to 20 degrees C. Except for a slightly delayed  germination, a reil1-1 mutant shows no further growth phenotype under the  currently investigated conditions. A comparative analysis demonstrates conserved  coexpression of orthologous genes from yeast and A. thaliana that are coregulated  with yeast rei1 or with A. thaliana REIL2, respectively. The conserved  correlations point to a role of A. thaliana REIL proteins in the maturation of  the eukaryotic ribosomal 60S subunit. We support this conclusion by heterologous  complementation of the cold-induced growth defect of the yeast Deltarei1 deletion.', '2013 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.223925', 'Kopka']
