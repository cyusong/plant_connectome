Southern corn leaf blight (SCLB), caused by Bipolaris maydis, is one of the most devastating diseases affecting maize production. However, only one SLCB resistance gene, conferring partial resistance, is currently known, underscoring the importance of isolating new SCLB resistance-related genes. Here, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis and identified 258 proteins showing differential abundance during the maize response to B. maydis. These proteins included an ascorbate peroxidase (Zea mays ascorbate peroxidase 1 (ZmAPX1)) encoded by a gene located within the mapping interval of a previously identified quantitative trait locus associated with SCLB resistance. ZmAPX1 overexpression resulted in lower H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> accumulation and enhanced resistance against B. maydis. Jasmonic acid (JA) contents and transcript levels for JA biosynthesis and responsive genes increased in ZmAPX1-overexpressing plants infected with B. maydis, whereas Zmapx1 mutants showed the opposite effects. We further determined that low levels of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> are accompanied by an accumulation of JA that enhances SCLB resistance. These results demonstrate that ZmAPX1 positively regulates SCLB resistance by decreasing H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> accumulation and activating the JA-mediated defense signaling pathway. This study identified ZmAPX1 as a potentially useful gene for increasing SCLB resistance. Furthermore, the generated data may be relevant for clarifying the functions of plant APXs.
