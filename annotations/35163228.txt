Cytogenetic approaches play an essential role as a quick evaluation of the first genetic effects after mutagenic treatment. Although labor-intensive and time-consuming, they are essential for the analyses of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in mutagenesis and environmental monitoring. Over the years, conventional cytogenetic analyses were a part of routine laboratory testing in plant genotoxicity. Among the methods that are used to study genotoxicity in plants, the micronucleus test particularly represents a significant force. Currently, cytogenetic techniques go beyond the simple detection of chromosome aberrations. The intensive development of molecular biology and the significantly improved microscopic visualization and evaluation methods constituted significant support to traditional cytogenetics. Over the past years, distinct approaches have allowed an understanding the mechanisms of formation, structure, and genetic activity of the micronuclei. Although there are many studies on this topic in humans and animals, knowledge in plants is significantly limited. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on micronuclei characteristics in plants. We pay particular attention to how the recent contemporary achievements have influenced the understanding of micronuclei in plant cells. Together with the current progress, we present the latest applications of the micronucleus test in mutagenesis and assess the state of the environment.
