Upon sensing nitrate, NODULE INCEPTION (NIN)-like protein (NLP) transcription factors alter gene expression to promote nitrate uptake and utilization. Of the nine NLPs in Arabidopsis, the physiological roles of only three NLPs (NLP6-NLP8) have been characterized to date. To evaluate the unique and redundant roles of Arabidopsis NLPs, we assessed the phenotypes of single and higher order nlp mutants. Unlike other nlp single mutants, nlp2 and nlp7 single mutants showed a reduction in shoot fresh weight when grown in the presence of nitrate as the sole nitrogen source, indicating that NLP2, like NLP7, plays a major role in vegetative growth. Interestingly, the growth defect of nlp7 recovered upon the supply of ammonium or glutamine, whereas that of nlp2 did not. Furthermore, complementation assays using chimeric constructs revealed that the coding sequence, but not the promoter region, of NLP genes was responsible for the differences between nlp2 and nlp7 single mutant phenotypes, suggesting differences in protein function. Importantly, nitrate utilization was almost completely abolished in the nlp septuple mutant (nlp2 nlp4 nlp5 nlp6 nlp7 nlp8 nlp9), suggesting that NLPs other than NLP2 and NLP7 also assist in the regulation of nitrate-inducible gene expression and nitrate-dependent promotion of vegetative growth in Arabidopsis.
