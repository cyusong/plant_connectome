['9539813', 'We identified a set of cytokinin-insensitive mutants by using a screen based on  the ethylene-mediated triple response observed after treatment with low levels of  cytokinins. One group of these mutants disrupts ACS5, a member of the Arabidopsis  gene family that encodes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase, the first  enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis. The ACS5 isoform is mainly responsible for the  sustained rise in ethylene biosynthesis observed in response to low levels of  cytokinin and appears to be regulated primarily by a posttranscriptional  mechanism. Furthermore, the dominant ethylene-overproducing mutant eto2 was found  to be the result of an alteration of the carboxy terminus of ACS5, suggesting  that this domain acts as a negative regulator of ACS5 function.', '1998 Apr 14', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.95.8.4766', 'Kieber']
