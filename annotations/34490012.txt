Silicon (Si) deficiency, caused by acidic soil and rainy climate, is a major constraint for sugarcane production in southern China. Si application generally improves sugarcane growth; however, there are few studies on the relationships between enhanced plant growth, changes in rhizosphere soil, and bacterial communities. A field experiment was conducted to measure sugarcane agronomic traits, plant nutrient contents, rhizosphere soil enzyme activities and chemical properties, and the rhizosphere bacterial community diversity and structure of three predominant sugarcane varieties under two Si treatments, i.e., 0 and 200 kg of silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) ha<sup>-1</sup> regarded as Si0 and Si200, respectively. Results showed that Si application substantially improved the sugarcane stalk fresh weight and Si, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) contents comparing to Si0, and had an obvious impact on rhizosphere soil pH, available Si (ASi), available P (AP), available K (AK), total phosphorus (TP), and the activity of acid phosphatase. Furthermore, the relative abundances of <i>Proteobacteria</i> showed a remarkable increase in Si200, which may be the dominant group in sugarcane growth under Si application. Interestingly, the AP was noticed as a major factor that caused bacterial community structure differences between the two Si treatments according to canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). In addition, the association network analysis indicated that Si application enriched the rhizosphere bacterial network, which could be beneficial to sugarcane growth. Overall, appropriate Si application, i.e., 200 kg SiO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> promoted sugarcane growth, changed rhizosphere soil enzyme activities and chemical properties, and bacterial community structures.
