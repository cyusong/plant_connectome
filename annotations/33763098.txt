Pine wilt disease, caused by the pinewood nematode, <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>, is one of the world's most serious tree diseases. Although the <i>B</i>. <i>xylophilus</i> whole-genome sequence and comprehensive secretome profile have been determined over the past decade, it remains unclear what molecules are critical in pine wilt disease and govern <i>B. xylophilus</i> virulence in host pine trees. Here, a comparative secretome analysis among four isolates of <i>B. xylophilus</i> with distinct virulence levels was performed to identify virulence determinants. The four candidate virulence determinants of <i>B. xylophilus</i> highly secreted in virulent isolates included lipase (Bx-lip1), glycoside hydrolase family 30 (Bx-GH30), and two C1A family cysteine peptidases (Bx-CAT1 and Bx-CAT2). To validate the quantitative differences in the four potential virulence determinants among virulence groups at the protein level, we used real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis to investigate these determinants at the transcript level at three time points: pre-inoculation, 3 days after inoculation (dai), and 7 dai into pine seedlings. The transcript levels of <i>Bx-CAT1</i>, <i>Bx-CAT2</i>, and <i>Bx-GH30</i> were significantly higher in virulent isolates than in avirulent isolates at pre-inoculation and 3 dai. A subsequent leaf-disk assay based on transient overexpression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> revealed that the GH30 candidate virulent factor caused cell death in the plant. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Bx-CAT2 was involved in nutrient uptake for fungal feeding via soaking-mediated RNA interference. These findings indicate that the secreted proteins Bx-GH30 and Bx-CAT2 contribute to <i>B. xylophilus</i> virulence in host pine trees and may be involved in pine wilt disease.
