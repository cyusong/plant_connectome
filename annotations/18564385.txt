['18564385', 'The Arabidopsis genome contains a gene (Atbt1) encoding a highly hydrophobic  membrane protein of the mitochondrial carrier family, with six predicted  transmembrane domains, and showing substantial structural similarity to Brittle1  proteins from maize and potato. We demonstrate that AtBT1 transports AMP, ADP and  ATP (but not ADP-glucose), shows a unidirectional mode of transport, and locates  to the plastidial membrane and not to the ER as previously proposed. Analysis  using an Atbt1 promoter-GUS construct revealed substantial gene expression in  rapidly growing root tips and maturating or germinating pollen. Survival of  homozygous Atbt1::T-DNA mutants is very limited, and those that do survive  produce non-fertile seeds. These observations indicate that no other carrier  protein or metabolic mechanism can compensate for the loss of this transporter.  Atbt1 RNAi dosage mutants show substantially retarded growth, adenylate levels  similar to those of wild-type plants, increased glutamine contents and unchanged  starch levels. Interestingly, the growth retardation of Atbt1 RNAi mutant plants  was circumvented by adenosine feeding, and was accompanied by increased adenylate  levels. Further observations showed the presence of a functional nucleotide  salvage pathway in Atbt1 RNAi mutants. In summary, our data indicate that AtBT1  is a plastidial nucleotide uniport carrier protein that is strictly required to  export newly synthesized adenylates into the cytosol.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03583.x', 'Neuhaus']
