Using the expression of fluorescence originated from the PSII open reaction center in the light by Oxborough and Baker (1997), we obtained a formula that expresses relationships between the quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry in the dark (Phi(m)= F(v)/F(m)) and in the light Phi'(m)=F'(v)/F'(m):Phi'(m)=Phi(m)+L(NP), where L(NP)(=F(0)/F'(m)) denotes the quantum yield of light induced non-photochemical losses (heat dissipation and fluorescence de-excitation) in PSII. Using L(NP) and other conventional fluorescence parameters, we conducted quenching analyses with leaves of broad bean plants (Vicia faba L.) grown at 700 (high light; HL) and 80 mumol photons m(-2) s(-1) (low light; LL). We also examined whether behavior of q(0) quenching (q(0)=1-F'(0)/F(0)) is related to the reaction center quenching. When the actinic light (AL) was strong, Stern-Volmer quenching [NPQ=(F(m)-F'(m))/F'(m)] and L(NP) increased rapidly and then decreased slowly in HL leaves, while, in LL leaves, they increased slowly. It is probable that rapid formation of a large proton gradient was responsible for sharp rises in both parameters in HL leaves. The steady-state 'excess' parameter [Phi(Ex)= (1 - qP) Phi(m)/(Phi(m)+ L(NP))], fraction of energy migrating to closed PSII centers, increased with the photon flux density of AL in LL leaves. In contrast, in HL leaves, Phi(Ex) did not increase markedly. The examination of the relationship between Phi(Ex) and L(NP) obtained at various AL revealed that in LL leaves the increase in (1 - qP) with the increase in AL prevailed, while, in HL leaves, the increase in L(NP) suppressed the increase in (1 - qP). Using the difference between L(NP) and L(D) (Phi(ND)= L(NP)- L(D), where L(D)= F(0)/F(m)), q(0) and qN (=1-F'(v)/F(v)) were calculated without using measured F'(0). The relationships between q(0) and qN thus obtained for various AL levels were almost identical for both HL and LL leaves, implying no difference in the fluorescence origin between the HL and LL leaves. Usefulness of these equations expressing non-photochemical loss is discussed.
