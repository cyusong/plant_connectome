Maize <i>ZmC1</i> and <i>ZmR</i> transcription factors belong to the MYB-type and bHLH families, respectively, and control anthocyanin biosynthesis. In this study, <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation was used to generate transgenic wheat plants that overexpress <i>ZmC1</i> and <i>ZmR</i> or both, with the objective of developing anthocyanin-enriched wheat germplasm. Three kinds of stable transgenic wheat lines were obtained. The integration of target genes in the transgenic wheat plants was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. We found that single overexpression of <i>ZmC1</i> regulates pigmentation in the vegetative tissues such as coleoptiles, auricles, and stems. The single overexpression of <i>ZmR</i> controls the coloration in reproductive tissue like spikelets and seeds. The simultaneous overexpression of <i>ZmC1</i> and <i>ZmR</i> showed the strongest pigmentation in almost all tissues. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that expression of the two transgenes, and of two conserved homologous and six associated structural genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in wheat were greatly up-regulated in the transgenic plants. Similarly, quantitative analysis for anthocyanin amounts based on HPLC-MS also confirmed that the transgenic wheat plants with combined overexpression of <i>ZmC1</i> and <i>ZmR</i> accumulated the highest quantity of pigment products. Moreover, developing seeds overexpressing <i>ZmR</i> exposed to light conditions showed up-regulated transcript levels of anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes compared to dark exposure, which suggests an important role of light in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides a foundation for breeding wheat materials with high anthocyanin accumulation and understanding the mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in wheat.
