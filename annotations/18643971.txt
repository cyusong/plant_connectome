N-acylethanolamines are a group of lipid mediators that accumulate under a variety of neurological and pathological conditions in mammals. N-acylethanolamine signaling is terminated by the action of diverse hydrolases, among which fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) has been well characterized. Here, we show that transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing an AtFAAH are more susceptible to the bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and P. syringae pv. maculicola. AtFAAH overexpressors also were highly susceptible to non-host pathogens P. syringae pv. syringae and P. syringae pv. tabaci. AtFAAH overexpressors had lower amounts of jasmonic acid, abscisic acid and both free and conjugated salicylic acid (SA), compared with the wild-type. Gene expression studies revealed that transcripts of a number of plant defense genes, as well as genes involved in SA biosynthesis and signaling, were lower in AtFAAH overexpressors than wild-type plants. Our data suggest that FAAH overexpression alters phytohormone accumulation and signaling which in turn compromises innate immunity to bacterial pathogens.

AtFAAH: !overexpresses! susceptibility to bacterial pathogens 
AtFAAH: !reduces! jasmonic acid, abscisic acid, free and conjugated salicylic acid 
AtFAAH: !alters! phytohormone accumulation and signaling 
phytohormone accumulation and signaling: !compromises! innate immunity to bacterial pathogens
