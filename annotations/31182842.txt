['31182842', 'Chloroplasts are integral to sensing biotic and abiotic stress in plants, but  their role in transducing Ca(2+)-mediated stress signals remains poorly  understood(1,2). Here we identify cMCU, a member of the mitochondrial calcium  uniporter (MCU) family, as an ion channel mediating Ca(2+) flux into chloroplasts  in vivo. Using a toolkit of aequorin reporters targeted to chloroplast stroma and  the cytosol in cMCU wild-type and knockout lines, we provide evidence that  stress-stimulus-specific Ca(2+) dynamics in the chloroplast stroma correlate with  expression of the channel. Fast downstream signalling events triggered by osmotic  stress, involving activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)  MAPK3 and MAPK6, and the transcription factors MYB60 and ethylene-response factor  6 (ERF6), are influenced by cMCU activity. Relative to wild-type plants, cMCU  knockouts display increased resistance to long-term water deficit and improved  recovery on rewatering. Modulation of stromal Ca(2+) in specific processing of  stress signals identifies cMCU as a component of plant environmental sensing.', '2019 Jun', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/s41477-019-0434-8', 'ORCID:']
