Fruit ripening and senescence are finely controlled by plant hormones such as ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) but also by calcium ions and by calcium-dependent signaling pathways. Although there are extensive data supporting an interaction between ethylene and calcium in fruit ripening, the regulatory mechanisms resulting from the interaction between ABA and calcium have not yet been fully clarified. In this article, we have reviewed the full roles of calcium and its sensors (CaM, CMLs, CDPKs, CBLs) as well as ABA and the interactions between the two signaling pathways in the regulation of stress responses and in fruit ripening. To illustrate the possible interaction between calcium sensors and ABA signaling components in the control of fruit ripening, we propose an interaction model between the calcium and ABA signaling pathways.
