Weeping is a specific plant architecture with high ornamental value. Despite the considerable importance of the weeping habit to landscaping applications and knowledge of plant architecture biology, little is known regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, growth and phytohormone content were analyzed among the progeny of different branch types in an F1 mapping population of Prunus mume with varying plant architecture. Bulked segregant RNA sequencing was conducted to compare differences among progeny at a transcriptional level. The weeping habit appears to be a complex process regulated by a series of metabolic pathways, with photosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis highly enriched in differentially expressed genes between weeping and upright progeny. Based on functional annotation and homologous analyses, we identified 30 candidate genes related to weeping that merit further analysis, including 10 genes related to IAA and GA<sub>3</sub> biosynthesis, together with 6 genes related to secondary branch growth. The results of this study will facilitate further studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying the weeping habit in P. mume.
