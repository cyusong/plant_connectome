<i>Prunus mume</i> var. purpurea, commonly known as "Red Bone", is a special variety with pink or purple-red xylem. It is famous due to gorgeous petals and delightful aromas, playing important roles in urban landscaping. The regulation mechanism of color formation in <i>P. mume</i> var. purpurea stem development is unclear. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome and metabolome in WYY ('Wuyuyu' accession, red stem) and FLE ('Fei Lve' accession, green stem), and found a total of 256 differential metabolites. At least 14 anthocyanins were detected in WYY, wherein cyanidin 3,5-O-diglucoside and peonidin3-O-glucoside were significantly accumulated through LC-MS/MS analysis. Transcriptome data showed that the genes related to flavonoid-anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways were significantly enriched in WYY. The ratio of dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (<i>DFR</i>) and flavonol synthase (<i>FLS</i>) expression levels may affect metabolic balance in WYY, suggesting a vital role in xylem color formation. In addition, several transcription factors were up-regulated, which may be the key factors contributing to transcriptional changes in anthocyanin synthesis. Overall, the results provide a reference for further research on the molecular mechanism of xylem color regulation in <i>P. mume</i> and lay a theoretical foundation for cultivating new varieties.
