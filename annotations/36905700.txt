The quality of cut Paeonia lactiflora flowers is limited by their low stem mechanical strength, but the underlying mechanism of this low strength is poorly understood. In this study, two P. lactiflora cultivars with distinct stem mechanical strengths (Chui Touhong with low stem mechanical strength and Da Fugui with high stem mechanical strength) were used as test materials. The xylem development was examined at the cellular level, and the phloem conductivity was analyzed by evaluating phloem geometry. The results showed that the secondary cell wall formation of the xylem of Chui Touhong was affected primarily in fiber cells but was affected little in vessel cells. The formation of the secondary cell walls in the xylem fiber cells of Chui Touhong was delayed, resulting in longer and thinner fiber cells with a lack of cellulose and S-lignin in the secondary cell walls. Moreover, the phloem conductivity of Chui Touhong was lower than that of Da Fugui, and more callose was accumulated in the lateral walls of the phloem sieve elements of Chui Touhong. Consequently, the delayed deposition of the secondary cell walls of the xylem fiber cells was the main factor leading to the low stem mechanical strength of Chui Touhong, and the low stem mechanical strength was closely related to the low conductivity of sieve tubes and extensive callose accumulation in the phloem. These findings provide a new perspective on enhancing P. lactiflora stem mechanical strength by targeting single cell level, and lay the foundation for future works on the correlation between phloem long-distance transport and stem mechanical strength.
