Ralstonia solanacearum is a devastating soil-borne bacterial pathogen capable of infecting many plant species, including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). However, the perception of Ralstonia by the tomato immune system and the pathogen's counter-defense strategy remain largely unknown. Here, we show that PehC, a specific exo-polygalacturonase secreted by Ralstonia, acts as an elicitor that triggers typical immune responses in tomato and other Solanaceous plants. The elicitor activity of PehC depends on its N-terminal epitope, and not on its polygalacturonase activity. The recognition of PehC specifically occurs in tomato roots and relies on unknown receptor-like kinase(s). Moreover, PehC hydrolyzes plant pectin-derived oligogalacturonic acids (OGs), a type of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), which leads to the release of galacturonic acid (GalA), thereby dampening DAMP-triggered immunity (DTI). Ralstonia depends on PehC for its growth and early infection and can utilize GalA as a carbon source in the xylem. Our findings demonstrate the specialized and dual functions of Ralstonia PehC, which enhance virulence by degrading DAMPs to evade DTI and produce nutrients, a strategy used by pathogens to attenuate plant immunity. Solanaceous plants have evolved to recognize PehC and induce immune responses, which highlights the significance of PehC. Overall, this study provides insight into the arms race between plants and pathogens.
