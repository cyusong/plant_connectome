['9664717', 'To identify molecules that function in the plant secretory pathway, we screened  for Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA clones that complement the temperature-sensitive  (ts), secretion-deficient sec15 mutation of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. RMA1,  one of the genes obtained in this screening, suppressed not only the ts growth of  sec15 but also its secretory defect. RMA1 is not a structural homologue of SEC15  but encodes a novel 28 kDa protein with a RING finger motif and a C-terminal  membrane-anchoring domain. Mutational analysis indicates that the RING finger  motif of RMA1 is important for its suppression activity. In Arabidopsis plant,  RMA1 is ubiquitously expressed. A search for homologous proteins in the database  revealed that Arabidopsis, nematode, mouse and human possess close homologues of  RMA1.', '1998 May', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029403', 'Nakano']
