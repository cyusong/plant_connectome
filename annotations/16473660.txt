In the current study, we investigated the influences of theobroxide on stem elongation in spinach (Spinacia oleracea). Our results showed that stem elongation and flower formation were inhibited by spraying spinach plants with theobroxide under inductive, long day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark), while application of exogenous applied GA3 prevented the effect of theobroxide. Quantitative analysis showed that theobroxide suppressed GA1 biosynthesis, whereas the endogenous content of jasmonic acid was unchanged. However, under short day conditions (10 h light/14 h dark), there were no differences in stem length between treated and untreated plants. These results suggest that the inhibition of stem elongation by theobroxide is probably due to the suppression of gibberellin biosynthesis.

theobroxide: !suppresses! GA1 biosynthesis
GA3: !prevents! theobroxide effect
jasmonic acid: !unchanged by! theobroxide
short day conditions: !no difference in! stem length
