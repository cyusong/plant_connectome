Plant defense, growth, and reproduction can be modulated by chemicals emitted from neighboring plants, mainly via volatile aboveground signals. However, belowground signals and their underlying control mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the root-secreted carotenoid (-)-loliolide mediates both defensive and reproductive responses in wild-type Arabidopsis, a carotenoid-deficient Arabidopsis mutant (szl1-1), and tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana). Wild-type Arabidopsis plants flower later than szl1-1, and they secrete (-)-loliolide into the soil, whereas szl1-1 roots do not. When Arabidopsis and tobacco occur together, wild-type Arabidopsis induces nicotine production and defense-related gene expression in tobacco, whereas szl1-1 impairs this induction but accelerates tobacco flowering. Furthermore, nicotine production and the expression of the key genes involved in nicotine biosynthesis (QPT, PMT1), plant defense (CAT1, SOD1, PR-2a, PI-II, TPI), and flowering (AP1, LFY, SOC1, FT3, FLC) are differently regulated by incubation with wild-type Arabidopsis and szl1-1 root exudates or (-)-loliolide. In particular, (-)-loliolide up-regulated flowering suppressors (FT3 and FLC) and transiently down-regulated flowering stimulators (AP1 and SOC1), delaying tobacco flowering. Therefore, root-secreted (-)-loliolide modulates plant belowground defense and aboveground flowering, yielding critical insights into plant-plant signaling interactions.
