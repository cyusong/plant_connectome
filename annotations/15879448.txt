Auxin influx carriers are involved in auxin transport and plant development. Here we show that the mutant of rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica cv IR8) arm2 is defective in the uptake of the naturally occurring auxin indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). The acropetal and basipetal transport of IBA is reduced in arm2 roots compared with wild type. In contrast, arm2 roots are normal with respect to uptake and transport of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Furthermore, arm2 roots are resistant to IBA but respond normally to IAA. The mutant analysis of arm2 indicates the presence of an influx carrier system for IBA in rice roots.

Auxin influx carriers: !transport! IBA 
arm2 mutant: !reduces! IBA uptake 
arm2 mutant: !resists! IBA 
arm2 mutant: !responds normally to! IAA
