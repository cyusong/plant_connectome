Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a class of conserved nuclear RNAs that play important roles in the modification of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) in plants. In rubber trees, rRNAs are run off with latex flow during tapping and need to be regenerated for maintaining the functions of the laticifer cells. SnoRNAs are expected to play essential roles in the regeneration of rRNAs. However, snoRNAs in the rubber tree have not been sufficiently characterized thus far. In this study, we performed nuclear RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify snoRNAs globally and investigate their roles in latex regeneration. We identified a total of 3,626 snoRNAs by computational prediction with nuclear RNA-seq data. Among these snoRNAs, 50 were highly expressed in latex; furthermore, the results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed the abundant expression of 31 of these snoRNAs in latex. The correlation between snoRNA expression and adjusted total solid content (TSC/C) identified 13 positively yield-correlated snoRNAs. To improve the understanding of latex regeneration in rubber trees, we developed a novel insulated tapping system (ITS), which only measures the latex regenerated in specific laticifers. Using this system, a laticifer-abundant snoRNA, <i>HbsnoR28</i>, was found to be highly correlated with latex regeneration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to globally identify snoRNAs that might be involved in latex regeneration regulation and provide new clues for unraveling the mechanisms underlying the regulation of latex regeneration.
