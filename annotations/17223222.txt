Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is often generated by cells and tissues under environmental stress. In this work, we provide evidence that plasma membrane (PM) NADPH oxidase-dependent H(2)O(2) production might act as an intermediate step in the NaCl-induced elevation of calcium (Ca) in roots of wheat. Remarkable increases in the content of total Ca were observed not only in roots exposed to NaCl but also in roots of seedlings exposed to exogenous H(2)O(2). In roots, H(2)O(2) production increased upon exposure to salt stress. PM vesicles were isolated from roots, and NADPH oxidase activity was determined by measuring superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) production. NADPH oxidase-dependent O(2)(-) production was 11.6nmolmg(-1)proteinmin(-1) in control vesicles, but 19.6nmol after NaCl treatment (24h), indicating that salt stress resulted in the activation of the PM NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, the NaCl-induced increase in total Ca was partially abolished by the addition of 150U/mL catalase (CAT), a H(2)O(2) scavenger, and also by 10microM diphenylane iodonium (DPI), a NADPH oxidase inhibitor. This data suggest that NADPH oxidase-dependent H(2)O(2) production might be involved in the modulation of the Ca content in wheat roots. In conclusion, our results show that salinity stress increases the total Ca content of wheat roots, which is partly due to PM NADPH oxidase-dependent H(2)O(2) generation.
