The cytokinin signaling pathway, which is mediated by <i>Arabidopsis</i> response regulator (ARR) proteins, has been involved in the modulation of some disease-resistance responses. Here, we describe novel functions of ARR6 in the control of plant disease-resistance and cell-wall composition. Plants impaired in <i>ARR6</i> function (<i>arr6</i>) were more resistant and susceptible, respectively, to the necrotrophic fungus <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i> and to the vascular bacterium <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i>, whereas <i>Arabidopsis</i> plants that overexpress <i>ARR6</i> showed the opposite phenotypes, which further support a role of <i>ARR6</i> in the modulation of disease-resistance responses against these pathogens. Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses revealed that, in <i>arr6</i> plants, canonical disease-resistance pathways, like those activated by defensive phytohormones, were not altered, whereas immune responses triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns were slightly enhanced. Cell-wall composition of <i>arr6</i> plants was found to be severely altered compared with that of wild-type plants. Remarkably, pectin-enriched cell-wall fractions extracted from <i>arr6</i> walls triggered more intense immune responses than those activated by similar wall fractions from wild-type plants, suggesting that <i>arr6</i> pectin fraction is enriched in wall-related damage-associated molecular patterns, which trigger immune responses. This work supports a novel function of <i>ARR6</i> in the control of cell-wall composition and disease resistance and reinforces the role of the plant cell wall in the modulation of specific immune responses.
