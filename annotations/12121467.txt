['12121467', 'Seed dormancy and germination are complex traits that are controlled by many  genes. Four mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana exhibiting a reduced dormancy  phenotype, designated rdo1, rdo2, rdo3, and rdo4, have been characterized, both  genetically and physiologically. Two of these mutants, rdo1 and rdo2, have been  described before, the other two represent novel loci. The mutants mapped on  chromosome 1 (rdo3), chromosome 2 (rdo2 and rdo4), and chromosome 3 (rdo1). None  of these loci has been related to dormancy before. All four mutants show  pleiotropic effects in the adult plant stage, which are different for each  mutant. None of the mutants is deficient in ABA. Compared to Ler (wild-type), ABA  sensitivity is not altered either, thereby excluding the possibility that ABA is  involved in causing the reduced dormancy phenotype. The GA requirement was  studied by using the GA biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol, and genetically by  generating double mutants with the GA-deficient mutant ga1-3. The results  obtained by these two methods were comparable for all but one mutant: rdo1. In a  GA-deficient background, rdo1, rdo2 and rdo3, all show sensitivity to GA between  that of ga1-3 and ga1-3 aba1. However, when using paclobutrazol rdo1 exhibited  the same sensitivity as rdo4 and wild-type. Analysis of double mutants among the  rdo mutants revealed a very complex and inconsistent pattern.', '2002 Aug', 'Physiol Plant', '10.1034/j.1399-3054.2002.1150415.x', 'Koornneef']
