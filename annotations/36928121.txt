Somatic hybrids between distant species offer a remarkable model to study genomic recombination events after mitochondrial fusion. Recently, our lab described highly chimeric mitogenomes in two somatic hybrids between the Solanaceae Nicotiana tabacum and Hyoscyamus niger resulting from interparental homologous recombination. To better examine the recombination map in somatic hybrid mitochondria, we developed a more sensitive bioinformatic strategy to detect recombination activity based on high-throughput sequencing without assembling the hybrid mitogenome. We generated a new intergeneric somatic hybrid between N. tabacum and Physochlaina orientalis and re-analyzed the somatic hybrids previously generated in our lab. We inferred 213 homologous recombination events across repeats of 2.1 kb on average. Most of them (~80%) were asymmetrical, consistent with the break-induced replication (BIR) pathway. Only rare (2.74%) non-homologous events were detected. Interestingly, independent events frequently occurred in the same regions within and across somatic hybrids, suggesting the existence of recombination hotspots in plant mitogenomes. BIR is the main pathway of interparental recombination in somatic hybrid mitochondria. Findings of this study are relevant to mitogenome editing assays and to mechanistic aspects of DNA integration following mitochondrial DNA horizontal transfer events.
