['16115071', 'CONSTANS (CO) is an important floral regulator in the photoperiod pathway,  integrating the circadian clock and light signal into a control for flowering  time. It is known that CO promotes flowering in Arabidopsis under long-day  conditions. CONSTANS-LIKE 9 (COL9) is a member of the CONSTANS-LIKE gene family,  encoding a nuclear protein. The expression of COL9 is regulated by the circadian  clock in the photoperiod pathway and is detected in various organs. Unexpectedly,  overexpression of COL9 in transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in delayed flowering,  while co-suppression lines and a transferred DNA (T-DNA) knockout line showed  earlier flowering under long-day conditions. Overexpression of COL9 did not  enhance the late-flowering phenotype in a co mutant background. Double  overexpressors produced by overexpression of CO in COL9 transgenic lines showed  an early flowering phenotype similar to single CO overexpressors. The pattern of  oscillation of a number of circadian-associated genes remained unchanged in the  COL9 transgenic lines. Compared with wild-type plants, the abundance of CO and  FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) mRNA was reduced in the COL9 overexpression lines. Our  results indicate that COL9 is involved in regulation of flowering time by  repressing the expression of CO, concomitantly reducing the expression of FT and  delaying floral transition.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02491.x', 'Wang']
