During the last decade, plant thioredoxins (TRX) h-type have been shown to be implicated in several new roles like the protection against the oxidative stress by their ability to reduce some antioxidant proteins as peroxiredoxins (PRX) or methionine-sulphoxide-reductases (MSR). However, the concept of the oxidative stress is changing and this fact raises the question of the TRX roles in this new context. In the January issue of Plant Physiology, we have presented two TRXsh from Pisum sativum differently involved in the control of the redox status. PsTRXh1 is an h-type TRX that acts by reducing classical antioxidant proteins. PsTRXh2 seems to be also involved in redox control, however it could act contrary to its counterpart h1. Both proteins may play antagonistic roles in pea in order to lead a better control of the redox status.

PsTRXh1: !reduces! classical antioxidant proteins
PsTRXh2: !acts contrary to! PsTRXh1
PsTRXh1 & PsTRXh2: !play antagonistic roles in! pea
