Asymmetric cell divisions are essential to generate different cellular lineages. In plants, asymmetric cell divisions regulate the correct formation of the embryo, stomatal cells, apical and root meristems, and lateral roots. Current knowledge of regulation of asymmetric cell divisions suggests that, in addition to the function of key transcription factor networks, epigenetic mechanisms play crucial roles. Therefore, we highlight the importance of epigenetic regulation and chromatin dynamics for integration of signals and specification of cells that undergo asymmetric cell divisions, as well as for cell maintenance and cell fate establishment of both progenitor and daughter cells. We also discuss the polarization and segregation of cell components to ensure correct epigenetic memory or resetting of epigenetic marks during asymmetric cell divisions.
