Plant filamentous temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) proteins have been reported to be involved in biological processes related to plastids. However, the precise functions of distinct isoforms are still elusive. Here, the intracellular localization of the FtsZ1-1 isoform in a moss, Physcomitrella patens, was examined. Furthermore, the in vivo interaction behaviour of four distinct FtsZ isoforms was investigated. Localization studies of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged FtsZ1-1 and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses employing all dual combinations of four FtsZ isoforms were performed in transient protoplast transformation assays. FtsZ1-1 is localized to network structures inside the chloroplasts and exerts influence on plastid division. Interactions between FtsZ isoforms occur in distinct ordered structures in the chloroplasts as well as in the cytosol. The results expand the view of the involvement of Physcomitrella FtsZ proteins in chloroplast and cell division. It is concluded that duplication and diversification of ftsZ genes during plant evolution were the main prerequisites for the successful remodelling and integration of the prokaryotic FtsZ-dependent division mechanism into the cellular machineries of distinct complex processes in plants.
