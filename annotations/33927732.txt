Microalgae are used as a source of lipids for the production of biofuels. Most algae produce neutral lipids under stress conditions. Here, lipid accumulation by the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> was examined during cultivation under iron-limiting conditions. Severe iron stress caused the cells to accumulate a significant amount of lipid, specifically triacylglycerols (TAGs), by compromising the growth. Semi-quantitative measurements by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed an increase in both carbohydrate and lipid content in iron-stressed <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cells compared to control. Analysis by flow cytometry and thin layer chromatography confirmed that severe iron deficiency-induced TAG accumulation to fourfold higher than in iron-replete control cells. This accumulation of TAGs was mostly degraded from chloroplast lipids accompanied by overexpression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT2A) protein. Furthermore, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis demonstrated significantly enhanced levels of C16:0, C18:2, and C18:3 fatty acids (FAs). These results indicate that iron stress triggers the rapid accumulation of TAGs in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cells. The enhanced production of these lipids caused by the iron deficiency may contribute to the efficient production of algal biofuels if we escalate to the photobioreactor's growth conditions.
