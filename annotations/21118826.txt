The supercomplex organization of photosystem complexes was studied in various cyanobacteria, a glaucocystophyte and a primitive rhodophyte by blue-native PAGE with a wide range of detergent concentrations. In contrast to known cyanobacteria that produced the PSI trimer, a filamentous N(2)-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and a glaucocystophyte Cyanophora paradoxa NIES 547 had a PSI tetramer and dimer but no trimer at all. This was confirmed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. A primitive rhodophyte Cyanidioschyzon merolae had two species of PSI monomeric complex with a light-harvesting Chl complex of a different composition. These results are discussed with regard to the evolution of the PSI supercomplex.
