Drought stress forms a major environmental constraint during the life cycle of plants, often decreasing plant yield and in extreme cases threatening survival. The molecular and physiological responses induced by drought have been the topic of extensive research during the past decades. Because soil-based approaches to studying drought responses are often challenging due to low throughput and insufficient control of the conditions, osmotic stress assays in plates were developed to mimic drought. Addition of compounds such as polyethylene glycol, mannitol, sorbitol, or NaCl to controlled growth media has become increasingly popular since it offers the advantage of accurate control of stress level and onset. These osmotic stress assays enabled the discovery of very early stress responses, occurring within seconds or minutes following osmotic stress exposure. In this review, we construct a detailed timeline of early responses to osmotic stress, with a focus on how they initiate plant growth arrest. We further discuss the specific responses triggered by different types and severities of osmotic stress. Finally, we compare short-term plant responses under osmotic stress versus in-soil drought and discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and future of these plate-based proxies for drought.
