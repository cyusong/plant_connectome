['11844111', 'The physiological role of the NADH-dependent glutamine-2-oxoglutarate  aminotransferase (NADH-GOGAT) enzyme was addressed in Arabidopsis using gene  expression analysis and by the characterization of a knock-out T-DNA insertion  mutant (glt1-T) in the single NADH-GOGAT GLT1 gene. The NADH-GOGAT GLT1 mRNA is  expressed at higher levels in roots than in leaves. This expression pattern  contrasts with GLU1, the major gene encoding Fd-GOGAT, which is most highly  expressed in leaves and is involved in photorespiration. These distinct  organ-specific expression patterns suggested a non-redundant physiological role  for the NADH-GOGAT and Fd-GOGAT gene products. To test the in vivo function of  NADH-GOGAT, we conducted molecular and physiological analysis of the glt1-T  mutant, which is null for NADH-GOGAT, as judged by mRNA level and enzyme  activity. Metabolic analysis showed that the glt1-T mutant has a specific defect  in growth and glutamate biosynthesis when photorespiration was repressed by 1%  CO2. Under these conditions, the glt1-T mutant displayed a 20% decrease in growth  and a dramatic 70% reduction in glutamate levels. Herein, we discuss the  significance of NADH-GOGAT in non-photorespiratory ammonium assimilation and in  glutamate synthesis required for plant development.', '2002 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2002.01218.x', 'Coruzzi']
