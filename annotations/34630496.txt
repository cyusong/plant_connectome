Medicinal plants have a variety of values and are an important source of new drugs and their lead compounds. They have played an important role in the treatment of cancer, AIDS, COVID-19 and other major and unconquered diseases. However, there are problems such as uneven quality and adulteration. Therefore, it is of great significance to find comprehensive, efficient and modern technology for its identification and evaluation to ensure quality and efficacy. In this study, deep learning, which is superior to conventional identification techniques, was extended to the identification of the part and region of the medicinal plant <i>Paris polyphylla</i> var. <i>yunnanensis</i> from the perspective of spectroscopy. Two pattern recognition models, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machine (SVM), were established, and the overall discrimination performance of the three types of models was compared. In addition, we also compared the effects of different sample sizes on the discriminant performance of the models for the first time to explore whether the three models had sample size dependence. The results showed that the deep learning model had absolute superiority in the identification of medicinal plant. It was almost unaffected by factors such as data type and sample size. The overall identification ability was significantly better than the PLS-DA and SVM models. This study verified the superiority of the deep learning from examples, and provided a practical reference for related research on other medicinal plants.
