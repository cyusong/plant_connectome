['17261077', 'Glutaminyl cyclases (QCs) catalyze the formation of pyroglutamic acid at the  N-terminus of several peptides and proteins. On the basis of the amino acid  sequence of Carica papaya QC, we identified cDNAs of the putative counterparts  from Solanum tuberosum and Arabidopsis thaliana. Upon expression of the  corresponding cDNAs from both plants via the secretory pathway of Pichia  pastoris, two active QC proteins were isolated. The specificity of the purified  proteins was assessed using various substrates with different amino acid  composition and length. Highest specificities were observed with substrates  possessing large hydrophobic residues adjacent to the N-terminal glutamine and  for fluorogenic dipeptide surrogates. However, compared to Carica papaya QC, the  specificity constants were approximately one order of magnitude lower for most of  the QC substrates analyzed. The QCs also catalyzed the conversion of N-terminal  glutamic acid to pyroglutamic acid, but with approximately 10(5)- to 10(6)-fold  lower specificity. The ubiquitous distribution of plant QCs prompted a search for  potential substrates in plants. Based on database entries, numerous proteins,  e.g., pathogenesis-related proteins, were found that carry a pyroglutamate  residue at the N-terminus, suggesting QC involvement. The putative relevance of  QCs and pyroglutamic acid for plant defense reactions is discussed.', '2007 Feb', 'Biol Chem', '10.1515/BC.2007.016', 'Wasternack']
