The aleurone layer of cereal grains is important biologically as well as nutritionally and economically. Here, current knowledge on the regulation of aleurone development is reviewed. Recent reports suggest that the control of aleurone development is more complex than earlier models portrayed. Multiple levels of genetic regulation control aleurone cell fate, differentiation, and organization. The hormones auxin and cytokinin can also influence aleurone development. New technical advances promise to facilitate future progress.
