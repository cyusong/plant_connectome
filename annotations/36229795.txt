N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are used as quorum-sensing signals by Gram-negative bacteria, but they can also affect plant growth and disease resistance. N-decanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C10-HSL) is an AHL that has been shown to inhibit primary root growth in Arabidopsis, but the mechanisms underlying its effects on root architecture are unclear. Here, we investigated the signaling components involved in C10-HSL-mediated inhibition of primary root growth in Arabidopsis, and their interplay, using pharmacological, physiological, and genetic approaches. Treatment with C10-HSL triggered a transient and immediate increase in the concentrations of cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MPK6), and induced nitric oxide (NO) production in Arabidopsis roots. Inhibitors of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels significantly alleviated the inhibitory effect of C10-HSL on primary root growth and reduced the amounts of ROS and NO generated in response to C10-HSL. Inhibition or scavenging of ROS and NO neutralized the inhibitory effect of C10-HSL on primary root growth. In terms of primary root growth, the respiratory burst oxidase homolog mutants and a NO synthase mutant were less sensitive to C10-HSL than wild type. Activation of MPKs, especially MPK6, was required for C10-HSL to inhibit primary root growth. The mpk6 mutant showed reduced sensitivity of primary root growth to C10-HSL, suggesting that MPK6 plays a key role in the inhibition of primary root growth by C10-HSL. Our results indicate that MPK6 acts downstream of ROS and upstream of NO in the response to C10-HSL. Our data also suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ROS, MPK6, and NO are all involved in the response to C10-HSL, and may participate in the cascade leading to C10-HSL-inhibited primary root growth in Arabidopsis.
