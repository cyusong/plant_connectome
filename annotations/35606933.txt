In a microgravity environment, without any gravitropic signal, plants are not able to define and establish a longitudinal growth axis. Consequently, absorption of water and nutrients by the root and exposure of leaves to sunlight for efficient photosynthesis is hindered. In these conditions, other external cues can be explored to guide the direction of organ growth. Providing a unilateral light source can guide the shoot growth, but prolonged root exposure to light causes a stress response, affecting growth and development, and also affecting the response to other environmental factors. Here, we have investigated how the protection of the root from light exposure, while the shoot is illuminated, influences the direction of root growth in microgravity. We report that the light avoidance mechanism existing in roots guides their growth towards diminishing light and helps establish the proper longitudinal seedling axis in simulated microgravity conditions. This process is regulated by flavonols, as shown in the flavonoid-accumulating mutant transparent testa 3, which shows an increased correction of the root growth direction in microgravity, when the seedling is grown with the root protected from light. This finding may improve the efficiency of water and nutrient sourcing and photosynthesis under microgravity conditions, as they exist in space, contributing to better plant fitness and biomass production in space farming enterprises, necessary for space exploration by humans.
