Plants have developed several strategies for coping with phosphorus (P) deficiency. However, the details of the regulation of gene expression of adaptations to low P are still unclear. Using a cDNA microarray, transcriptomic analyses were carried out of the rice genes regulated by P deficiency and P re-supply to P-deficient plants. The OsPI1 gene, which was isolated as the most significant up-regulated gene under -P conditions, was also the most significant down-regulated gene following P re-supply. Many starch metabolism-related genes, as well as several genes for P(i)-liberating enzymes, were up-regulated by -P treatment, suggesting a homeostatic contribution to the P(i) concentration in leaf tissues. mRNAs for glucanases were also induced by P re-supply: these are suspected to play a role in loosening the cell wall compounds. Most of the genes up-regulated by -P treatment were down-regulated by P re-supply, suggesting that their responses were specific to -P conditions. Conversely, the number of genes up-regulated by P re-supply was also larger following P re-supply than in the -P condition. It is proposed that the genes up-regulated by P re-supply play an important role in P acquisition by P-deficient plants.
