In most plants, NO(3)(-) constitutes the major source of nitrogen, and its assimilation into amino acids is mainly achieved in shoots. Furthermore, recent reports have revealed that reduction of NO(3)(-) translocation from roots to shoots is involved in plant acclimation to abiotic stress. NPF2.3, a member of the NAXT (nitrate excretion transporter) sub-group of the NRT1/PTR family (NPF) from Arabidopsis, is expressed in root pericycle cells, where it is targeted to the plasma membrane. Transport assays using NPF2.3-enriched Lactococcus lactis membranes showed that this protein is endowed with NO(3)(-) transport activity, displaying a strong selectivity for NO(3)(-) against Cl(-). In response to salt stress, NO(3)(-) translocation to shoots is reduced, at least partly because expression of the root stele NO(3)(-) transporter gene NPF7.3 is decreased. In contrast, NPF2.3 expression was maintained under these conditions. A loss-of-function mutation in NPF2.3 resulted in decreased root-to-shoot NO(3)(-) translocation and reduced shoot NO(3)(-) content in plants grown under salt stress. Also, the mutant displayed impaired shoot biomass production when plants were grown under mild salt stress. These mutant phenotypes were dependent on the presence of Na(+) in the external medium. Our data indicate that NPF2.3 is a constitutively expressed transporter whose contribution to NO(3)(-) translocation to the shoots is quantitatively and physiologically significant under salinity.
