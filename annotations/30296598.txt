The process of pollen germination is crucial for flowering plant reproduction, but the mechanisms through which pollen grains establish polarity and select germination sites are not well understood. In this study, we report that a formin family protein, AtFH5, is localized to the vesicles and rotates ahead of Lifeact-mEGFP-labeled actin filaments during pollen germination. The translocation of AtFH5 to the plasma membrane initiates the assembly of a collar-like actin structure at the prospective germination site prior to germination. Genetic and pharmacological evidence further revealed an interdependent relationship between the mobility of AtFH5-labeled vesicles and the polymerization of actin filaments: vesicle-localized AtFH5 promotes actin assembly, and the polymerization and elongation of actin filaments, in turn, is essential for the mobility of AtFH5-labeled vesicles in pollen grains. Taken together, our work revealed a molecular mechanism underlying the polarity establishment and vesicle mobility during pollen germination.
