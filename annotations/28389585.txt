['28389585', 'Plant cells are totipotent and competent to regenerate from differentiated  organs. It has been known for six decades that cytokinin-rich medium induces  shoot regeneration from callus cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism  remains elusive. The homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) is essential  for de novo establishment of the shoot stem cell niche in Arabidopsis thaliana We  found that WUS-positive (WUS(+)) cells mark the shoot progenitor region during  regeneration. A cytokinin-rich environment initially promotes the removal of the  repressive histone mark H3K27me3 at the WUS locus in a cell cycle-dependent  manner. Subsequently, the B-type ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORs (ARRs) ARR1,  ARR2, ARR10, and ARR12, which function as transcriptional activators in the  cytokinin signaling pathway, spatially activate WUS expression through binding  with microRNA165/6-targeted HD-ZIP III transcription factors. Thus, our results  provide important insights into the molecular framework for cytokinin-directed  shoot regeneration and reveal a two-step mechanism for de novo activation of WUS.', '2017 May', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.16.00863', 'ORCID:']
