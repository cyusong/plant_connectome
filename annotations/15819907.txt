Overall metabolic modifications between fruit of light-hyperresponsive high-pigment (hp) tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) mutant plants and isogenic nonmutant (wt) control plants were compared. Targeted metabolite analyses, as well as large-scale nontargeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolite profiling, were used to phenotype the differences in fruit metabolite composition. Targeted high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA) metabolite analyses showed higher levels of isoprenoids and phenolic compounds in hp-2dg fruit. Nontargeted GC-MS profiling of red fruits produced 25 volatile compounds that showed a 1.5-fold difference between the genotypes. Analyses of red fruits using HPLC coupled to high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) in both ESI-positive and ESI-negative mode generated, respectively, 6168 and 5401 mass signals, of which 142 and 303 showed a twofold difference between the genotypes. hp-2dg fruits are characterized by overproduction of many metabolites, several of which are known for their antioxidant or photoprotective activities. These metabolites may now be more closely implicated as resources recruited by plants to respond to and manage light stress. The similarity in metabolic alterations in fruits of hp-1 and hp-2 mutant plants helps us to understand how hp mutations affect cellular processes.
