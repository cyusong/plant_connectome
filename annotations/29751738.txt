Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is the most devastating pathogen of soybean. Our previous study showed that the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Bacillus simplex strain Sneb545 promotes soybean resistance to SCN. Here, we conducted a combined metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis to gain information regarding the biological mechanism of defence enhancement against SCN in Sneb545-treated soybean. To this end, we compared the transcriptome and metabolome of Sneb545-treated and non-treated soybeans under SCN infection. Transcriptomic analysis showed that 6792 gene transcripts were common in Sneb545-treated and non-treated soybeans. However, Sneb545-treated soybeans showed a higher concentration of various nematicidal metabolites, including 4-vinylphenol, methionine, piperine, and palmitic acid, than non-treated soybeans under SCN infection. Overall, our results validated and expanded the existing models regarding the co-regulation of gene expression and metabolites in plants, indicating the advantage of integrated system-oriented analysis.
