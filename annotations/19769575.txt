['19769575', 'The recent discovery of a variety of receptors has led to new models for hormone  perception in plants. In the case of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), which  regulates plant responses to abiotic stress, perception seems to occur both at  the plasma membrane and in the cytosol. The cytosolic receptors for ABA have  recently been identified as complexes between protein phosphatases 2C (PP2C) and  regulatory components (RCAR/PYR/PYL) that bind ABA. Binding of ABA to the  receptor complexes inactivates the PP2Cs, thereby activating the large variety of  physiological processes regulated by ABA. The Arabidopsis genome encodes 13  homologues of RCAR1 and approximately 80 PP2Cs, of which six in clade A have been  identified as negative regulators of ABA responses. In this study we characterize  a novel member of the RCAR family, RCAR3. RCAR3 was identified in a screen for  interactors of the PP2Cs ABI1 and ABI2, which are key regulators of ABA  responses. RCAR3 was shown to repress ABI1 and ABI2 in vitro, and to stimulate  ABA signalling in protoplast cells. RCAR3 conferred greater ABA sensitivity to  the PP2C regulation than RCAR1, whereas stereo-selectivity for (S)-ABA was less  stringent with RCAR3 as compared with RCAR1. In addition, regulation of the  protein phosphatase activity by RCAR1 and RCAR3 was more sensitive to ABA for  ABI1 than for ABI2. Based on the differences we have observed in transcriptional  regulation and biochemical properties, we propose a model whereby differential  expression of the co-receptors and combinatorial assembly of the receptor  complexes act in concert to modulate and fine-tune ABA responses.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04025.x', 'Grill']
