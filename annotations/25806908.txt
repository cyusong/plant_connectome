Magnesium (Mg) is one of the most important nutrients, involves mainly in plant growth and development. However, the signaling pathways response to magnesium stresses (MgSs) is known little, but several studies lately may improve the research development. Several phytohormones such as abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, auxins, and their factors were found responding to MgSs, and there may be some signal pathways linking these hormones and downstream reactions together, e.g., carbon fixation and transfer, starch and sugar metabolism, ion uptaking and reactive oxygen species (ROS) increasing. Consequently, Arabidopsis morphogenesis is remodeled. In this review, we mainly discussed recent literatures involving in plant response to MgSs (Mg deficiency (MgD) and Mg toxicity (MgT)), including plant morphogenesis remodeling, magnesium transporters and signaling transductions. Moreover, the future study challenges related to the responding signalings to MgSs in plants are also presented. Regardless, the iceberg of signal transduction of MgSs in plants is appeared.
