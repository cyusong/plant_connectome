Chloroplast photo-relocation movement is crucial for plant survival; however, the mechanism of this phenomenon is still poorly understood. Especially, the signal that goes from photoreceptor to chloroplast is unknown, although the photoreceptors (phototropin 1 and 2) have been identified and an actin structure (chloroplast actin filaments) has been characterized that is specific for chloroplast movement. Here, in gametophytes of the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris, gametophores of the moss Physcomiterella patens, and leaves of the seed plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we sought to characterize the signaling system by measuring the lifetime of the induced response. Chloroplast movements were induced by microbeam irradiation with high-intensity blue light and recorded. The lifetime of the avoidance state was measured as a lag time between switching off the beam and the loss of avoidance behavior, and that of the accumulation state was measured as the duration of accumulation behavior following the extinction of the beam. The lifetime for the avoidance response state is approximately 3-4 min and that for the accumulation response is 19-28 min. These data suggest that the two responses are based on distinct signals.

phototropin 1: !induces! chloroplast movement 
phototropin 2: !induces! chloroplast movement 
chloroplast actin filaments: !mediates! chloroplast movement 
high-intensity blue light: !induces! avoidance response 
high-intensity blue light: !induces! accumulation response 
avoidance response: !lasts! 3-4 min 
accumulation response: !lasts! 19-28 min
