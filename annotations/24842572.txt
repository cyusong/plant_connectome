['24842572', "Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates ion channel activity and stomatal movements in  response to drought and other stresses. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis  thaliana gene NRGA1 is a putative mitochondrial pyruvate carrier which negatively  regulates ABA-induced guard cell signaling. NRGA1 transcript was abundant in the  A. thaliana leaf and particularly in the guard cells, and its product was  directed to the mitochondria. The heterologous co-expression of NRGA1 and AtMPC1  in yeast complemented a loss-of-function mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)  mutant. The nrga1 loss-of-function mutant was very sensitive to the presence of  ABA in the context of stomatal movements, and exhibited a heightened tolerance to  drought stress. Disruption of NRGA1 gene resulted in increased ABA inhibition of  inward K(+) currents and ABA activation of slow anion currents in guard cells.  The nrga1/NRGA1 functional complementation lines restored the mutant's  phenotypes. Furthermore, transgenic lines of constitutively overexpressing NRGA1  showed opposite stomatal responses, reduced drought tolerance, and ABA  sensitivity of guard cell inward K(+) channel inhibition and anion channel  activation. Our findings highlight a putative role for the mitochondrial pyruvate  carrier in guard cell ABA signaling in response to drought.", '2014 Oct', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssu061', 'Zhang']
