Immunolabeling can be used to locate plant cell wall carbohydrates or other components to specific cell types or to specific regions of the wall. Some antibodies against xylans exist; however, many partly react with the xylan backbone and thus provide limited information on the type of substituents present in various xylans. We have produced a monoclonal antibody which specifically recognizes glucopyranosyl uronic acid (GlcA), or its 4-O-methyl ether (meGlcA), substituents in xylan and has no cross-reactivity with linear or arabinofuranosyl-substituted xylans. The UX1 antibody binds most strongly to (me)GlcA substitutions at the non-reducing ends of xylan chains, but has a low cross-reactivity with internal substitutions as well, at least on oligosaccharides. The antibody labeled plant cell walls from both mono- and dicotyledons, but in most tissues an alkaline pretreatment was needed for antibody binding. The treatment removed acetyl groups from xylan, indicating that the vicinity of glucuronic acid substituents is also acetylated. The novel labeling patterns observed in the xylem of tree species suggested that differences within the cell wall exist both in acetylation degree and in glucuronic acid content.
