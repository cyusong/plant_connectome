['32015349', 'Auxin determines the developmental fate of plant tissues, and local auxin  concentration is precisely controlled. The role of auxin transport in modulating  local auxin concentration has been widely studied but the regulation of local  auxin biosynthesis is less well understood. Here, we show that TRYPTOPHAN  AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS (TAA1), a key enzyme in the auxin biosynthesis  pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana is phosphorylated at Threonine 101 (T101). T101  phosphorylation status can act as an on/off switch to control TAA1-dependent  auxin biosynthesis and is required for proper regulation of root meristem size  and root hair development. This phosphosite is evolutionarily conserved  suggesting post-translational regulation of auxin biosynthesis may be a general  phenomenon. In addition, we show that auxin itself, in part via TRANS-MEMBRANE  KINASE 4 (TMK4), can induce T101 phosphorylation of TAA1 suggesting a  self-regulatory loop whereby local auxin signalling can suppress biosynthesis. We  conclude that phosphorylation-dependent control of TAA1 enzymatic activity may  contribute to regulation of auxin concentration in response to endogenous and/or  external cues.', '2020 Feb 3', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-020-14395-w', 'ORCID:']
