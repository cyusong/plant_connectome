['17202180', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes a small family of histidine (His) protein  kinases, some of which have redundant functions as ethylene receptors, whereas  others serve as cytokinin receptors. The most poorly characterized of these is  authentic histidine kinase 5 (AHK5; also known as cytokinin-independent 2, CKI2).  Here we characterize three independent ahk5 mutants, and show that they have a  common phenotype. Our results suggest that AHK5 His-kinase acts as a negative  regulator in the signaling pathway in which ethylene and ABA inhibit the root  elongation through ETR1 (an ethylene receptor).', '2007 Feb', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcl065', 'Mizuno']
