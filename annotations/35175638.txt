Reactive oxygen species (ROS) release seed dormancy through an unknown mechanism. We used different seed dormancy-breaking treatments to decipher the dynamics and localization of ROS production during seed germination. We studied the involvement of ROS in the breaking of Arabidopsis seed dormancy by cold stratification, gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub> ) and light. We characterized the effects of these treatments on abscisic acid and gibberellins biosynthesis and signalling pathways. ROS, mitochondrial redox status and peroxisomes were visualized and/or quantified during seed imbibition. Finally, we performed a cytogenetic characterization of the nuclei from the embryonic axes during seed germination. We show that mitochondria participate in the early ROS production during seed imbibition and that a possible involvement of peroxisomes in later stages should still be analysed. At the time of radicle protrusion, ROS accumulated within the nucleus, which correlated with nuclear expansion and chromatin decompaction. Taken together, our results provide evidence of the role of ROS trafficking between organelles and of the nuclear redox status in the regulation of seed germination by dormancy.
