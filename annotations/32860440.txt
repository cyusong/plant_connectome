Plants need to attune their stress responses to the ongoing developmental programmes to maximize their efficacy. For instance, successful submergence adaptation is often associated with a delicate balance between saving resources and their expenditure to activate measures that allow stress avoidance or attenuation. We observed a significant decrease in submergence tolerance associated with ageing in Arabidopsis thaliana, with a critical step between 2 and 3 weeks of post-germination development. This sensitization to flooding was concomitant with the transition from juvenility to adulthood. Transcriptomic analyses indicated that a group of genes related to abscisic acid and oxidative stress response was more highly expressed in juvenile plants than in adult ones. These genes are induced by the endomembrane tethered transcription factor ANAC017 that was in turn activated by submergence-associated oxidative stress. A combination of molecular, biochemical and genetic analyses showed that these genes are located in genomic regions that move towards a heterochromatic state with adulthood, as marked by lysine 4 trimethylation of histone H3. We concluded that, while the mechanisms of flooding stress perception and signal transduction were unaltered between juvenile and adult phases, the sensitivity that these mechanisms set into action is integrated, via epigenetic regulation, into the developmental programme of the plant.
