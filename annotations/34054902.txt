Nitrate is an important source of nitrogen for poplar trees. The nitrate transporter (<i>NRT</i>) gene family is generally responsible for nitrate absorption and distribution. However, few analyses of the genetic effects and expression patterns of <i>NRT</i> family members have been conducted in woody plants. Here, using poplar as a model, we identified and characterized 98 members of the <i>PtoNRT</i> gene family. We calculated the phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships of the <i>PtoNRT</i> family and identified poplar-specific <i>NRT</i> genes and their expression patterns. To construct a core triple genetic network (association - gene expression - phenotype) for leaf nitrogen content, a candidate gene family association study, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and mapping of expression quantitative trait nucleotides (eQTNs) were combined, using data from 435 unrelated <i>Populus</i>. <i>tomentosa</i> individuals. <i>PtoNRT</i> genes exhibited distinct expression patterns between twelve tissues, circadian rhythm points, and stress responses. The association study showed that genotype combinations of allelic variations of three <i>PtoNRT</i> genes had a strong effect on leaf nitrogen content. WGCNA produced two co-expression modules containing <i>PtoNRT</i> genes. We also found that four <i>PtoNRT</i> genes defined thousands of eQTL signals. WGCNA and eQTL provided comprehensive analysis of poplar nitrogen-related regulatory factors, including MYB17 and WRKY21. <i>NRT</i> genes were found to be regulated by five plant hormones, among which abscisic acid was the main regulator. Our study provides new insights into the <i>NRT</i> gene family in poplar and enables the exploitation of novel genetic factors to improve the nitrate use efficiency of trees.
