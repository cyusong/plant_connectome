MiPEPs are short natural peptides encoded by microRNAs in plants. Exogenous application of miPEPs increases the expression of their corresponding miRNA and, consequently, induces consistent phenotypical changes. Therefore, miPEPs carry huge potential in agronomy as gene regulators that do not require genome manipulation. However, to this end, it is necessary to know their mode of action, including where they act and how they enter the plants. Here, after analyzing the effect of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> miPEP165a on root and aerial part development, we followed the internalization of fluorescent-labelled miPEP165a into roots and compared its uptake into endocytosis-altered mutants to that observed in wild-type plants treated or not with endocytosis inhibitors. The results show that entry of miPEP165a involves both a passive diffusion at the root apex and endocytosis-associated internalization in the differentiation and mature zones. Moreover, miPEP165a is unable to enter the central cylinder and does not migrate from the roots to the aerial part of the plant, suggesting that miPEPs have no systemic effect.
