Increasing crop yields by using ecofriendly practices is of high priority to tackle problems regarding food security and malnutrition worldwide. A sustainable crop production requires a limited use of fertilizer and the employment of plant varieties with improved ability to acquire nutrients from soil. To reach these goals, the scientific community aims to understand plant nutrients homeostasis by deciphering the nutrient sensing and signalling mechanisms of plants. Several lines of evidence about the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the signal of an impaired nutrient availability have been reported. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling is a tightly regulated process that requires specific protein toolkits to perceive external stimuli and to induce the specific responses in the plant needed to survive. Here, we summarize both older and recent findings concerning the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in the homeostasis of nutrients. In this review, we present new emerging technologies, based on the use of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors and advanced microscopy, which offer the chance to perform in planta analyses of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics at cellular resolution. The harnessing of these technologies with different genetic backgrounds and subjected to different nutritional stresses will provide important insights to the still little-known mechanisms of nutrient sensing in plants.
