['20197506', 'The root cap has a central role in root growth, determining the growth trajectory  and facilitating penetration into the soil. Root cap cells have specialized  functions and morphologies, and border cells are released into the rhizosphere by  specific cell wall modifications. Here, we demonstrate that the cellular  maturation of root cap is redundantly regulated by three genes, SOMBRERO (SMB),  BEARSKIN1 (BRN1), and BRN2, which are members of the Class IIB NAC transcription  factor family, together with the VASCULAR NAC DOMAIN (VND) and NAC SECONDARY WALL  THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR (NST) genes that regulate secondary cell wall  synthesis in specialized cell types. Lateral cap cells in smb-3 mutants continue  to divide and fail to detach from the root, phenotypes that are independent of  FEZ upregulation in smb-3. In brn1-1 brn2-1 double mutants, columella cells fail  to detach, while in triple mutants, cells fail to mature in all parts of the cap.  This complex genetic redundancy involves differences in expression, protein  activity, and target specificity. All three genes have very similar  overexpression phenotypes to the VND/NST genes, indicating that members of this  family are largely functionally equivalent. Our results suggest that Class IIB  NAC proteins regulate cell maturation in cells that undergo terminal  differentiation with strong cell wall modifications.', '2010 Mar', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.109.072272', 'Scheres']
