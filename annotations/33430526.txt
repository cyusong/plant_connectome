The content and composition of starch in cereal grains are closely related to yield. Few studies have been done on the identification of the genes or loci associated with these traits in barley. This study was conducted to identify the genes or loci controlling starch traits in barley grains, including total starch (TS), amylose (AC) and amylopectin (AP) contents. A large genotypic variation was found in all examined starch traits. GWAS analysis detected 13, 2, 10 QTLs for TS, AC and AP, respectively, and 5 of them were commonly shared by AP and TS content. qTS-3.1, qAC-6.2 and qAP-5.1 may explain the largest variation of TS, AC and AP, respectively. Four putative candidate genes, i.e., <i>HORVU6Hr1G087920</i>, <i>HORVU5Hr1G011230</i>, <i>HORVU5Hr1G011270</i> and <i>HORVU5Hr1G011280</i>, showed the high expression in the developing barley grains when starch accumulates rapidly. The examined 100 barley accessions could be divided into two groups based on the polymorphism of the marker S5H_29297679, with 93 accessions having allele GG and seven accessions having AA. Moreover, significantly positive correlation was found between the number of favorable alleles of the identified QTLs and TS, AC, AP content. In conclusion, the identified loci or genes in this study could be useful for genetic improvement of grains starch in barley.
