Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a versatile signaling molecule that regulates multiple physiological processes in plants, including growth and development, immunity, and stress response as well. Signaling triggered by H<sub>2</sub>S is proposed to occur via persulfidation, an oxidative post-translational modification (PTM) of cysteine residues (-SH) to persulfides (-SSH). Notwithstanding the growing body of information for the plant persulfidation proteome, the gap between the molecular mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>S and physiological functions of protein persulfidation remains large. In this mini-review, we discussed the specific regulatory mechanism of persulfidation on guard cell abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and the possible link of persulfidation, sulfenylation, and S-nitrosylation within the framework of redox-based regulation.
