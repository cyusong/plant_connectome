Hybrid rice breeding for exploiting hybrid vigor, heterosis, has greatly increased grain yield. However, the heterosis-related genes associated with rice grain production remain largely unknown, partly because comprehensive mapping of heterosis-related traits is still labor-intensive and time-consuming. Here, we present a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping method, GradedPool-Seq, for rapidly mapping QTLs by whole-genome sequencing of graded-pool samples from F<sub>2</sub> progeny via bulked-segregant analysis. We implement this method and map-based cloning to dissect the heterotic QTL GW3p6 from the female line. We then generate the near isogenic line NIL-FH676::GW3p6 by introgressing the GW3p6 allele from the female line Guangzhan63-4S into the male inbred line Fuhui676. The NIL-FH676::GW3p6 exhibits grain yield highly increased compared to Fuhui676. This study demonstrates that it may be possible to achieve a high level of grain production in inbred rice lines without the need to construct hybrids.
