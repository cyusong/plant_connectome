Clubroot caused by <i>Plasmodiophora brassicae</i> is a severe threat to the production of <i>Brassica napus</i>, worldwide. The cultivation of resistant varieties is the most efficient and environmentally friendly way to limit disease spread. We developed a highly resistant <i>B. napus</i> line, ZHE226, containing the resistance locus <i>PbBa8.1</i>. However, ZHE226 seeds contain high erucic acid content, which limits its cultivation owing to its low edible oil quality. A segregation population of BC<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> was developed by crossing ECD04, a resistant European turnip donor, with Huangshuang5, an elite variety with no erucic acid in its seeds, as a recurrent plant. Fine mapping using the bulk segregation analysis sequencing (BSA-Seq) approach detected <i>PbBa8.1</i> within a 2.9 MB region on chromosome A08. Interestingly, the previously reported resistance gene <i>Crr1a</i> was found in the same region. Genetic analysis revealed that the CAP-134 marker for <i>Crr1a</i> was closely linked with clubroot resistance (CR). Thus, <i>PbBa8.1</i> and <i>Crr1a</i> might be allelic for CR. Moreover, comparative and genetic analysis showed that high erucic acid in the seeds of ZHE226 was due to linkage drag of <i>fatty acid elongase 1</i> (<i>FAE1</i>) in the ECD04 line, which was located in the interval of <i>PbBa8.1</i> with a physical and genetic distance of 729 Kb and 1.86 cm, respectively. Finally, a clubroot-resistant line with a low erucic acid content was successfully developed through gene-specific molecular marker assistant selection from BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>4</sub>. These results will accelerate CR breeding programs in <i>B. napus.</i>
