This work reports the first characterization of the natural variation of Zn tolerance and accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Root and shoot growth as well as Zn content were determined for 27 A. thaliana accessions grown in vitro in presence of Zn concentrations ranging from 1 to 250 µm. All traits varied by at least twofold and their broad sense heritability varied from 0.36 to 0.91. Primary and lateral root developments were differently affected by Zn in the different accessions. Remarkably, Zn was for the first time shown to be essential for the development of lateral roots. As a general rule, the different traits showed uncorrelated variations. In particular, variation in Zn tolerance was not linked to either root or shoot Zn contents. The only detectable relationship between different traits linked Zn sensitivity of roots to root-to-shoot Zn translocation but the correlation between variation of these traits was pretty low. This suggests that Zn translocation from root to shoots explains only a part of Zn tolerance. Our analysis opens the way to the characterization of genetic determinants controlling different Zn-related traits through the identification of particular accessions displaying contrasted phenotypes and representing excellent starting material to develop quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies.
