Modulation of membrane lipid composition under varying environmental conditions is an important part of plant stress adaptation. Most notably, proportional changes of lipid composition in response to temperature changes are a major cellular response to requirements of membrane fluidity adjustment. In higher plants, synthesis of glycerolipids is accomplished by 2 major pathways, the prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathway, located in the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), respectively. Recently, we systematically investigated the re-adjustments of glycerolipid pathways under temperature stress at the metabolite and transcript levels using 3 plant species with distinct lipid profiles. The relative contributions of 2 pathways and lipid channeling from the ER and chloroplast were both observed in plants under temperature stress. Potential factors controlling the lipid flux were identified through transcriptome analysis.
