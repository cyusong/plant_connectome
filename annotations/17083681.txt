Mangrove ecosystems can be either nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) limited and are therefore vulnerable to nutrient pollution. Nutrient enrichment with either N or P may have differing effects on ecosystems because of underlying differences in plant physiological responses to these nutrients in either N- or P-limited settings. Using a common mangrove species, Avicennia germinans, in sites where growth was either N or P limited, we investigated differing physiological responses to N and P limitation and fertilization. We tested the hypothesis that water uptake and transport, and hydraulic architecture, were the main processes limiting productivity at the P-limited site, but that this was not the case at the N-limited site. We found that plants at the P-deficient site had lower leaf water potential, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic carbon-assimilation rates, and less conductive xylem, than those at the N-limited site. These differences were greatly reduced with P fertilization at the P-limited site. By contrast, fertilization with N at the N-limited site had little effect on either photosynthetic or hydraulic traits. We conclude that growth in N- and P-limited sites differentially affect the hydraulic pathways of mangroves. Plants experiencing P limitation appear to be water deficient and undergo more pronounced changes in structure and function with relief of nutrient deficiency than those in N-limited ecosystems.
