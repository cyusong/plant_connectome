['17021043', 'In flowering plants, diploid sporophytic tissues in ovules and anthers support  meiosis and subsequent haploid gametophyte development. These analogous  reproductive functions suggest that common mechanisms may regulate ovule and  anther development. Two Arabidopsis Auxin Response Factors, ARF6 and ARF8,  regulate gynoecium and stamen development in immature flowers. Wild-type pollen  grew poorly in arf6 arf8 gynoecia, correlating with ARF6 and ARF8 expression in  style and transmitting tract. ARF6 and ARF8 transcripts are cleavage targets of  the microRNA miR167, and overexpressing miR167 mimicked arf6 arf8 phenotypes.  Mutations in the miR167 target sites of ARF6 or ARF8 caused ectopic expression of  these genes in domains of both ovules and anthers where miR167 was normally  present. As a result, ovule integuments had arrested growth, and anthers grew  abnormally and failed to release pollen. Thus, miR167 is essential for correct  patterning of gene expression, and for fertility of both ovules and anthers. The  essential patterning function of miR167 contrasts with cases from animals in  which miRNAs reinforce or maintain transcriptionally established gene expression  patterns.', '2006 Nov', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.02602', 'Reed']
