The distribution and evolution of Au SINE in plants were examined. Au SINE is a short interspersed element first identified in Aegilops umbellulata, a close relative of wheat. The Au SINE was previously found in species such as wheat, maize, tobacco, and tomato, but not in rice. In this study, we first searched public databases, and next examined the presence of Au in a broad range of plant species by PCR using internal primers of Au. Although Au is likely to be absent from many species including rice, it was identified in many Gramineae, Solanaceae, and Fabaceae species, and also in a basal angiosperm species, Asimina triloba. Phylogenetic studies suggest that Au SINE originated before the divergence of monocots and eudicots. Au SINE sequences of Asimina, Triticum, Zea, Nicotiana, Lotus, Medicago, and Glycine were aligned and compared. Although sequences of Au were highly conserved among distantly related species, every Au element in Glycine had a 16 bp deletion and its 3' end differed from sequences of other species. This type of Au could only be found in G. max, and not in other species including other Fabaceae species such as M. truncatula and L. japonicus. This is the first report of a plant SINE family present in multiple lineages, and the evolution of Au SINE in the plant kingdom, especially in Gramineae and Fabaceae is discussed.
