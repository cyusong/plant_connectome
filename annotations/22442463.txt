Adler et al. (Reports, 23 September 2011, p. 1750) analyzed the standardized sampling data from 48 herbaceous-dominated plant communities and concluded that "Productivity is a poor predictor of plant species richness" at fine-scale. However, their method was biased toward site-number-dominated plant communities. They also failed to provide enough data for regional analysis and detailed information for within-site analysis.
