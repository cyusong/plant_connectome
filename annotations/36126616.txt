Common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) is an important leguminous crop, providing humans with starch from seeds, feeding livestock with vegetative organs, or fertilizing soils by returning to field. It is aimed to evaluate salt tolerance in common vetch collections for breeding programs and to investigate the underlined physiological mechanisms. Relative germination rate and relative seedling growth showed great difference among common vetch collections in response to salt. A lower level of Na<sup>+</sup> and higher levels of K<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio were maintained in both shoots and roots in salt-tolerant collections than in salt-sensitive ones under salt stress. Expression of the genes involved in transportation and redistribution of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> were cooperatively responsible for salt stress. Transcript levels of NHX7, HKT1, AKT2, and HAK17 in leaves and roots were induced after salt stress, with higher transcript levels in salt-tolerant collections compared with the sensitive ones. Proline and P5CS1 transcript levels were increased after salt stress, with higher levels in salt-tolerant collection compared with salt-sensitive ones. Both O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were accumulated after salt stress, and lower levels were accumulated in salt-tolerant collection compared with salt-sensitive ones. Superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activities were altered in response to salt and higher levels were maintained in salt-tolerant collections compared with salt-sensitive ones. It is suggested that salt tolerance in common vetch is associated with maintenance of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and the associated gene expression and promoted proline accumulation and antioxidant defense system.
