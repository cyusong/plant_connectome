['21505433', 'Higher plants require chloroplasts for essential functions in photosynthesis and  other important physiological processes, such as sugar, lipid and amino-acid  biosynthesis. Most chloroplast proteins are nuclear-encoded proteins that are  synthesized in the cytosol as precursors, and imported into chloroplasts by  protein translocases in the outer and inner chloroplast envelope. The imported  chloroplast proteins are then translocated into or across the thylakoid membrane  by four distinct pathways. However, the mechanisms by which the imported  nuclear-encoded proteins are delivered to these pathways remain largely unknown.  Here we show that an Arabidopsis ankyrin protein, LTD (mutation of which causes  the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein translocation defect), is  localized in the chloroplast and using yeast two-hybrid screens demonstrate that  LTD interacts with both proteins from the signal recognition particle (SRP)  pathway and the inner chloroplast envelope. Our study shows that LTD is essential  for the import of light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins and subsequent  routing of these proteins to the chloroplast SRP-dependent pathway.', '2011', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms1278', 'Zhang']
