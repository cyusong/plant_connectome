<i>Gibberella</i> stalk rot (GSR) caused by <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> is one of the most devastating diseases causing significant yield loss of maize, and GSR resistance is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes. Although a few quantitative trait loci/resistance genes have been identified, the molecular mechanisms underlying GSR resistance remain largely unexplored. To identify potential resistance genes and to better understand the molecular mechanism of GSR resistance, a joint analysis using a comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches was conducted using two inbred lines with contrasting GSR resistance, K09 (resistant) and A08 (susceptible), upon infection with <i>F. graminearum</i>. While a substantial number of differentially expressed genes associated with various defense-related signaling pathways were identified between two lines, multiple hub genes likely associated with GSR resistance were pinpointed using Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis and K-means clustering. Moreover, a core set of metabolites, including anthocyanins, associated with the hub genes was determined. Among the complex co-expression networks, <i>ZmHIR3</i> showed strong correlation with multiple key genes, and genetic and histological studies showed that <i>zmhir3</i> mutant is more susceptible to GSR, accompanied by enhanced cell death in the stem in response to infection with <i>F. graminearum</i>. Taken together, our study identified differentially expressed key genes and metabolites, as well as co-expression networks associated with distinct infection stages of <i>F. graminearum</i>. Moreover, <i>ZmHIR3</i> likely plays a positive role in disease resistance to GSR, probably through the transcriptional regulation of key genes, functional metabolites, and the control of cell death.
