['21673079', 'Arabidopsis thaliana MYB80 (formerly MYB103) is expressed in the tapetum and  microspores between anther developmental stages 6 and 10. MYB80 encodes a MYB  transcription factor that is essential for tapetal and pollen development. Using  microarray analysis of anther mRNA, we identified 404 genes differentially  expressed in the myb80 mutant. Employing the glucocorticoid receptor system, the  expression of 79 genes was changed when MYB80 function was restored in the myb80  mutant following induction by dexamethasone. Thirty-two genes were analyzed using  chromatin immunoprecipitation, and three were identified as direct targets of  MYB80. The genes encode a glyoxal oxidase (GLOX1), a pectin methylesterase  (VANGUARD1), and an A1 aspartic protease (UNDEAD). All three genes are expressed  in the tapetum and microspores. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed  that MYB80 binds to all three target promoters, with the preferential binding  site containing the CCAACC motif. TUNEL assays showed that when UNDEAD expression  was silenced using small interfering RNA, premature tapetal and pollen programmed  cell death occurred, resembling the myb80 mutant phenotype. UNDEAD possesses a  mitochondrial targeting signal and may hydrolyze an apoptosis-inducing protein(s)  in mitochondria. The timing of tapetal programmed cell death is critical for  pollen development, and the MYB80/UNDEAD system may regulate that timing.', '2011 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.082651', 'Parish']
