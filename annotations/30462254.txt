Bax-inhibitor 1 (BI-1) is a cell death suppressor conserved in all eukaryotes that modulates cell death in response to abiotic stress and pathogen attack in plants. However, little is known about its role in the establishment of symbiotic interactions. Here, we demonstrate the functional relevance of an Arabidopsis thaliana BI-1 homolog (PvBI-1a) to symbiosis between the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and Rhizobium tropici. We show that the changes in expression of PvBI-1a observed during early symbiosis resemble those of some defence response-related proteins. By using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that the overexpression of PvBI-1a in the roots of common bean increases the number of rhizobial infection events (and therefore the final number of nodules per root), but induces the premature death of nodule cells, affecting their nitrogen fixation efficiency. Nodule morphological alterations are known to be associated with changes in the expression of genes tied to defence, autophagy, and vesicular trafficking. Results obtained in the present work suggest that BI-1 has a dual role in the regulation of programmed cell death during symbiosis, extending our understanding of its critical function in the modulation of host immunity while responding to beneficial microbes.
