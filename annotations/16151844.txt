AtOPT promoter-GUS fusions were constructed for six of the nine known, putative oligopeptide transporters (OPTs) in Arabidopsis thaliana and used to examine AtOPT expression at various stages of plant development. AtOPT1, AtOPT3, AtOPT4, AtOPT6 and AtOPT7 were expressed in the embryonic cotyledons prior to root radicle emergence. Except for AtOPT8, which gave weak expression, all AtOPTs were strongly expressed in post-germinative seedlings with strongest expression in vascular tissues of cotyledons and hypocotyls. Preferential expression of AtOPTs in vascular tissues was also observed in cotyledons, leaves, hypocotyls, roots, flowers, siliques, and seed funiculi of seedlings and adult plants. Differential tissue-specific expression was observed for specific AtOPTs. For example, AtOPT1, AtOPT3 and AtOPT8 were uniquely expressed in pollen. Only AtOPT1 was expressed in growing pollen tubes, while only AtOPT6 was observed in ovules. AtOPT8 was transiently expressed in seeds during early stages of embryogenesis. Iron limitation was found to enhance expression of AtOPT3. These data suggest distinct cellular roles for specific AtOPTs including nitrogen mobilization during germination and senescence, pollen tube growth, pollen and ovule development, seed formation and metal transport.
