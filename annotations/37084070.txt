Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi can both accelerate and decelerate decomposition of organic matter in forest soils, but a mechanistic understanding of this differential influence is limited. Here, we tested how ECM fungi affect decomposition along a natural fertility gradient in a temperate forest of European beech. Trees were girdled to reduce belowground carbon supply to the soil. Girdling shifted soil fungal community composition and decreased hyphal biomass production and soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux, indicating a reduced ECM fungal activity. Girdling also affected decomposition processes, but the effects depended on fertility. Our results indicate that ECM fungi decelerate decomposition under conditions of low fertility while under conditions of high fertility ECM fungi and their host roots have an accelerating effect. We conclude that both acceleration and deceleration of decomposition of organic matter by ECM fungi can occur within a forest, with soil fertility determining the direction and magnitude of these effects. We suggest a positive feedback between fertility, stand productivity and soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics that is mediated to a large extent by ECM fungi.

ECM fungi: !accelerate! decomposition (high fertility)
ECM fungi: !decelerate! decomposition (low fertility)
fertility: !determines! direction/magnitude of ECM fungal effects
ECM fungi: !mediates! positive feedback between fertility, stand productivity and soil carbon/nitrogen dynamics
