Adventitious root formation is an essential physiological process for successful propagation of cuttings in various plant species. Because coniferous species are highly heterozygous, propagation of cuttings is of great practical use in breeding. Although various factors influence adventitious root formation, little is known of the associated regulatory mechanisms. Whereas adventitious roots generally form from the base of cuttings, this process is accompanied by physiological changes in leaves, which supply assimilates and metabolites. Herein, we present microarray analyses of transcriptome dynamics during adventitious root formation in whole cuttings in the coniferous species, Cryptomeria japonica. Temporal patterns of gene expression were determined in the base, the middle, and needles of cuttings at eight time points during adventitious root formation. Global gene expression at the base had diverged from that in the middle by 3-h post-insertion, and changed little in the subsequent 3-days post-insertion, and global gene expression in needles altered characteristically at 3- and 6-weeks post-insertion. In Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of major gene clusters based on hierarchical clustering, the expression profiles of genes related to carbohydrates, plant hormones, and other categories indicated multiple biological changes that were involved in adventitious root formation. The present comprehensive transcriptome analyses indicate major transcriptional turning and contribute to the understanding of the biological processes and molecular factors that influence adventitious root formation in C. japonica.
