The presence of Bacillus cereus plays a key role in clubroot suppression and improves plant biomass in pak choi. B. cereus is reported for the first time as a novel biocontrol agent against clubroot. Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin causes a devastating infectious disease known as clubroot that is damaging to cruciferous vegetables. This study aimed to isolate beneficial bacteria from the rhizosphere soil of pak choi (Brassica campestris sp. chinensis) and to evaluate the ability of the isolate to reduce the severity of clubroot. Strains obtained from the rhizosphere of symptomless pak choi were first selected on the basis of their germination inhibition rate and effects on the viability of P. brassicae resting spores. Eight bacterial isolates had inhibitory effects against the resting spores of clubroot causing pathogen. However, MZ-12 showed the highest inhibitory effect at 73.4%. Inoculation with MZ-12 enhanced the plant biomass relative to plants grown without MZ-12 as well as P. brassicae infected plants. Furthermore, enhanced antioxidant enzymatic activities were observed in clubroot-infected plants during bacterial association. Co-inoculation of the plant with both P. brassicae and MZ-12 resulted in a 64% reduction of gall formation in comparison to plants inoculated with P. brassicae only. Three applications of MZ-12 to plants infected with P. brassicae at 7, 14 and 21 days after seeding (DAS) were more effective than one application and repressed root hair infection. According to 16S rDNA sequence analysis, strain MZ-12 was identified as had a 100% sequence similarity with type strain Bacillus cereus. The findings of the present study will facilitate further investigation into biological mechanisms of cruciferous clubroot control.
