Tiller angle in cereals is a key shoot architecture trait that strongly influences grain yield. Studies in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) have implicated shoot gravitropism in the regulation of tiller angle. However, the functional link between shoot gravitropism and tiller angle is unknown. Here, we conducted a large-scale transcriptome analysis of rice shoots in response to gravistimulation and identified two new nodes of a shoot gravitropism regulatory gene network that also controls rice tiller angle. We demonstrate that HEAT STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2D (HSFA2D) is an upstream positive regulator of the LAZY1-mediated asymmetric auxin distribution pathway. We also show that two functionally redundant transcription factor genes, <i>WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX6</i> (<i>WOX6</i>) and <i>WOX11</i>, are expressed asymmetrically in response to auxin to connect gravitropism responses with the control of rice tiller angle. These findings define upstream and downstream genetic components that link shoot gravitropism, asymmetric auxin distribution, and rice tiller angle. The results highlight the power of the high-temporal-resolution RNA-seq data set and its use to explore further genetic components controlling tiller angle. Collectively, these approaches will identify genes to improve grain yields by facilitating the optimization of plant architecture.
