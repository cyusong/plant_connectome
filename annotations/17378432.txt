Global analysis of gene expression changes in soybean (Glycine max) and Heterodera glycines (soybean cyst nematode [SCN]) during the course of infection in a compatible interaction was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip soybean genome array. Among 35,611 soybean transcripts monitored, we identified 429 genes that showed statistically significant differential expression between uninfected and nematode-infected root tissues. These included genes encoding enzymes involved in primary metabolism; biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, lignin, and flavonoids; genes related to stress and defense responses; cell wall modification; cellular signaling; and transcriptional regulation. Among 7,431 SCN transcripts monitored, 1,850 genes showed statistically significant differential expression across different stages of nematode parasitism and development. Differentially expressed SCN genes were grouped into nine different clusters based on their expression profiles during parasitism of soybean roots. The patterns of gene expression we observed in SCN suggest coordinated regulation of genes involved in parasitism. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the results of our microarray analysis. The simultaneous genome-wide analysis of gene expression changes in the host and pathogen during a compatible interaction provides new insights into soybean responses to nematode infection and the first profile of transcript abundance changes occurring in the nematode as it infects and establishes a permanent feeding site within a host plant root.
