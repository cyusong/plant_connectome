['27020959', 'In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II (PSII) catalyzes the  light-driven oxidation of water. The oxygen-evolving complex of PSII is a Mn4CaO5  cluster embedded in a well-defined protein environment in the thylakoid membrane.  However, transport of manganese and calcium into the thylakoid lumen remains  poorly understood. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana PHOTOSYNTHESIS  AFFECTED MUTANT71 (PAM71) is an integral thylakoid membrane protein involved in  Mn(2+) and Ca(2+) homeostasis in chloroplasts. This protein is required for  normal operation of the oxygen-evolving complex (as evidenced by oxygen evolution  rates) and for manganese incorporation. Manganese binding to PSII was severely  reduced in pam71 thylakoids, particularly in PSII supercomplexes. In cation  partitioning assays with intact chloroplasts, Mn(2+) and Ca(2+) ions were  differently sequestered in pam71, with Ca(2+) enriched in pam71 thylakoids  relative to the wild type. The changes in Ca(2+) homeostasis were accompanied by  an increased contribution of the transmembrane electrical potential to the proton  motive force across the thylakoid membrane. PSII activity in pam71 plants and the  corresponding Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant cgld1 was restored by  supplementation with Mn(2+), but not Ca(2+) Furthermore, PAM71 suppressed the  Mn(2+)-sensitive phenotype of the yeast mutant Deltapmr1 Therefore, PAM71 presumably  functions in Mn(2+) uptake into thylakoids to ensure optimal PSII performance.', '2016 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00812', 'Leister']
