['32636339', 'In plants, small RNAs are loaded into ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins to fulfill their  regulatory functions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), one of the most abundant classes of  endogenous small RNAs, are preferentially loaded into AGO1. Such loading, long  believed to happen exclusively in the cytoplasm, was recently proposed to also  occur in the nucleus. Here, we identified CONSTITUTIVE ALTERATIONS IN THE SMALL  RNAS PATHWAYS9 (CARP9), a nuclear-localized, intrinsically disordered protein, as  a factor promoting miRNA activity in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).  Mutations in the CARP9-encoding gene led to a mild reduction of miRNAs levels,  impaired gene silencing, and characteristic morphological defects, including  young leaf serration and altered flowering time. Intriguingly, we found that  CARP9 was able to interact with HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1), but not with other  proteins of the miRNA biogenesis machinery. In the same way, CARP9 appeared to  interact with mature miRNA, but not with primary miRNA, positioning it after  miRNA processing in the miRNA pathway. CARP9 was also able to interact with AGO1,  promoting its interaction with HYL1 to facilitate miRNA loading in AGO1. Plants  deficient in CARP9 displayed reduced levels of AGO1-loaded miRNAs, partial  retention of miRNA in the nucleus, and reduced levels of AGO1. Collectively, our  data suggest that CARP9 might modulate HYL1-AGO1 cross talk, acting as a scaffold  for the formation of a nuclear post-primary miRNA-processing complex that  includes at least HYL1, AGO1, and HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 90. In such a complex, CARP9  stabilizes AGO1 and mature miRNAs, allowing the proper loading of miRNAs in the  effector complex.', '2020 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.20.00258', 'ORCID:']
