['2535470', "S-Adenosylmethionine serves as a methyl group donor in numerous transmethylation  reactions and plays a role in the biosynthesis of polyamines and ethylene. We  have cloned and sequenced an S-adenosylmethionine synthetase gene (sam-1) of  Arabidopsis thaliana. The deduced polypeptide sequence of the enzyme has  extensive homology with the corresponding enzymes of Escherichia coli and yeast.  Genomic hybridization indicates the presence of two adenosylmethionine synthetase  genes per haploid Arabidopsis genome. RNA gel blot analysis shows that  adenosylmethionine synthetase mRNA levels are high in stems and roots,  correlating well with the higher enzyme activity in stems, compared with leaves.  Histochemical analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis plants transformed with a  chimeric beta-glucuronidase gene, under the control of 748-base pair 5' sequences  of the sam-1 gene, demonstrates that the gene is expressed primarily in vascular  tissues. In addition, high expression was observed in sclerenchyma and in the  root cortex. A hypothesis for the strong cellular preference in the expression of  the sam-1 gene is presented.", '1989 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.1.1.81', 'Inze']
