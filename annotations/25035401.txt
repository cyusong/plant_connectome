['25035401', 'Tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) is a prerequisite for pollen grain  development in angiosperms, and cysteine proteases are the most ubiquitous  hydrolases involved in plant PCD. We identified a papain-like cysteine protease,  CEP1, which is involved in tapetal PCD and pollen development in Arabidopsis  thaliana. CEP1 is expressed specifically in the tapetum from stages 5 to 11 of  anther development. The CEP1 protein first appears as a proenzyme in precursor  protease vesicles and is then transported to the vacuole and transformed into the  mature enzyme before rupture of the vacuole. cep1 mutants exhibited aborted  tapetal PCD and decreased pollen fertility with abnormal pollen exine. A  transcriptomic analysis revealed that 872 genes showed significantly altered  expression in the cep1 mutants, and most of them are important for tapetal cell  wall organization, tapetal secretory structure formation, and pollen development.  CEP1 overexpression caused premature tapetal PCD and pollen infertility. ELISA  and quantitative RT-PCR analyses confirmed that the CEP1 expression level showed  a strong relationship to the degree of tapetal PCD and pollen fertility. Our  results reveal that CEP1 is a crucial executor during tapetal PCD and that proper  CEP1 expression is necessary for timely degeneration of tapetal cells and  functional pollen formation.', '2014 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.114.127282', 'ORCID:']
