The tomato dgt mutant, containing a single mutation in the Cyclophilin1 (SlCyp1) gene, is auxin insensitive and exhibits a pleotropic phenotype that includes lack of lateral roots, malformed xylem structure and reduced root-to-shoot ratio. Recently, we found that the SlCyp1 protein is phloem-mobile and traffic from shoot to root to induce lateral root formation. These processes are achieved through activation of auxin-mediated developmental programs. Inhibition of the trafficked SlCyp1 activity at the target site resulted in inhibition of the auxin response, supporting the hypothesis that this protein is indeed a mobile signal. Here, we show that partial silencing of SlCyp1 in the phloem only resulted in perturbed auxin response in the roots and reduced photosynthetic and transpiration rates. The presented data suggests that expression of SlCyp1 in the phloem is essential for proper auxin response at the whole plant level. We, therefore, propose that this protein acts as a long-distance signaling molecule acting as coordinator between roots and shoot activities.
