In compound leaves, leaflet primordia are initiated directionally along the lateral sides. Our understanding of the molecular basis of leaflet initiation has improved, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying spatio-temporal patterns remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of acropetal (from the base to the tip) progression of leaflet initiation in Eschscholzia californica. We established an ultraviolet-laser ablation system to manipulate compound-leaf development. Local ablation at the leaflet incipient site generated leaves with asymmetric morphology. In the majority of cases, leaflets that were initiated on the ablated sides shifted apically. Finite time-course observation revealed that the timing of leaflet initiation was delayed, but the distance from the leaf tip did not decrease. These results were suggestive of the local spacing mechanism in leaflet initiation, whereby the distance from the leaf tip and adjacent pre-existing leaflet determines the position of leaflet initiation. To understand how such a local patterning mechanism generates a global pattern of successive leaflet initiation, we assessed the growth rate gradient along the apical-basal axis. Our time-course analysis revealed differential growth rates along the apical-basal axis of the leaf, which can explain the acropetal progression of leaflet initiation. We propose that a leaflet is initiated at a site where the distances from pre-existing leaflets and the leaf tip are sufficient. Furthermore, the differential growth rate may be a developmental factor underlying the directionality of leaflet initiation.
