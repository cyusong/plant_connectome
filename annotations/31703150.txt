Although the alteration of DNA methylation due to abiotic stresses, such as exposure to the toxic metal cadmium (Cd), has been often observed in plants, little is known about whether such epigenetic changes are linked to the ability of plants to adapt to stress. Herein, we report a close linkage between DNA methylation and the adaptational responses in Arabidopsis plants under Cd stress. Exposure to Cd significantly inhibited the expression of three DNA demethylase genes ROS1/DML2/DML3 (RDD) and elevated DNA methylation at the genome-wide level in Col-0 roots. Furthermore, the profile of DNA methylation in Cd-exposed Col-0 roots was similar to that in the roots of rdd triple mutants, which lack RDD, indicating that Cd-induced DNA methylation is associated with the inhibition of RDD. Interestingly, the elevation in DNA methylation in rdd conferred a higher tolerance against Cd stress and improved cellular Fe nutrition in the root tissues. In addition, lowering the Fe supply abolished improved Cd tolerance due to the lack of RDD in rdd. Together, these data suggest that the inhibition of RDD-mediated DNA demethylation in the roots by Cd would in turn enhance plant tolerance to Cd stress by improving Fe nutrition through a feedback mechanism.
