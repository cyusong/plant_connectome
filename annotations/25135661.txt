['25135661', 'Nucleobase ascorbate transporters (NATs), also known as  Nucleobase:Cation-Symporter 2 (NCS2) proteins, belong to an evolutionary  widespread family of transport proteins with members in nearly all domains of  life. We present the biochemical characterization of two NAT proteins, NAT3 and  NAT12 from Arabidopsis thaliana after their heterologous expression in  Escherichia coli UraA knockout mutants. Both proteins were shown to transport  adenine, guanine and uracil with high affinities. The apparent KM values were  determined with 10.12muM, 4.85muM and 19.95muM, respectively for NAT3 and 1.74muM,  2.44muM and 29.83muM, respectively for NAT12. Competition studies with the three  substrates suggest hypoxanthine as a further substrate of both transporters.  Furthermore, the transport of nucleobases was markedly inhibited by low  concentrations of a proton uncoupler indicating that NAT3 and NAT12 act as  proton-nucleobase symporters. Transient expression studies of NAT-GFP fusion  constructs revealed a localization of both proteins in the plasma membrane. Based  on the structural information of the uracil permease UraA from E. coli, a  three-dimensional experimentally validated homology model of NAT12 was created.  The NAT12 structural model is composed of 14 TM segments and divided into two  inverted repeats of TM1-7 and TM8-14. Docking studies and mutational analyses  identified residues involved in NAT12 nucleobase binding including Ser-247,  Phe-248, Asp-461, Thr-507 and Thr-508. This is the first study to provide insight  into the structure-function of plant NAT proteins, which reveals differences from  the other members of the NCS2 protein family.', '2014 Dec', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbamem.2014.08.013', 'Mohlmann']
