Dark-grown sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seedlings exhibit modulation of total superoxide dismutase (SOD;EC 1.15.1.1) activity in roots and cotyledons (10,000g supernatant) in response to salt stress (NaCl; 120 mM) through a differential, zymographically detectable, whole tissue activity of FeSOD and Cu/ZnSOD. Confocal laser scanning microscopic imaging (CLSM) has further shown that NaCl stress significantly influences differential spatial distribution of Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD isoforms in an inverse manner. Dual action of nitric oxide (NO) is evident in its crosstalk with FeSOD and Cu/ZnSOD in seedling roots and cotyledons in control and NaCl(-) stress conditions. Cu/ZnSOD activity in the roots of 2 d old NaCl(-) stressed seedlings is enhanced in the presence of 125-1000 µM of NO donor (sodium nitroprusside; SNP) indicating salt sensitivity of the enzyme activity. Quenching of endogenous NO by cPTIO treatment (500, 1000 µM) lowers FeSOD activity in roots (-NaCl). Cotyledons from control seedlings show an upregulation of FeSOD activity with increasing availability of SNP (125-1000 µM) in the Hoagland irrigation medium. Quenching of NO by cPTIO provides evidence for an inverse correlation between NO availability and FeSOD activity in seedling cotyledons irrespective of NaCl stress. Variable response due to NO on SOD isoforms in sunflower seedlings reflects its concentration-dependent biphasic (pro- and antioxidant) nature of action. Differential induction of SOD isoforms by NO indicates separate intracellular signaling pathways (associated with their respective functional separation) operative in seedling roots as an early salt stress mechanism and in cotyledons as an early long-distance NaCl stress sensing mechanism.
