Coordination of gene expression in mitochondria, plastids, and nucleus is critical for plant development and survival. Although WHIRLY2 (WHY2) is involved in mitochondrial genome repair and affects the DNA copy number of the mitochondrial genome, the detailed mechanism of action of the WHY2 protein is still elusive. In this study, we found that WHY2 was triple-localized among the mitochondria, plastids, and the nucleus during Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aging. Overexpressing WHY2 increased starch granule numbers in chloroplasts of pericarp cells, showing a partially dry, yellowing silique and early senescence leaves. Accordingly, WHY2 protein could directly activate the expression of <i>jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase</i> and <i>senescence associated gene 29</i> (<i>SWEET15</i>) gene expression and repress <i>SWEET11</i> gene expression in the nucleus, leading to alteration of starch accumulation and transport in pericarp cells. In contrast, loss of WHY2 decreased starch and sugar content in pericarp cells but promoted starch accumulation in leaves and seeds. These phenotypes of WHY2-overexpressing plants were enhanced in response to methyl jasmonate. Our results suggest that WHY2 in plastids, mitochondria, and the nucleus plays a vital role in alteration of carbon reallocation from maternal tissue to filial tissue.
