Identification of trait enhancing QTLs for yield and photosynthesis-related traits in rice using interspecific mapping population and chromosome segment substitution lines derived from a cross between Oryza sativa and Oryza rufipogon. Wild rice contains novel genes which can help in improving rice yield. Common wild rice Oryza rufipogon is a known source for enhanced photosynthesis and yield-related traits. We developed BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2:3:4</sub> mapping populations using O. rufipogon IC309814 with high photosynthetic rate as donor, and elite cultivar MTU1010 as recurrent parent. Evaluation of 238 BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> families for 13 yield-related traits and 208 BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> families for seven photosynthesis-related physiological traits resulted in identification of significantly different lines which performed better than MTU1010 for various yield contributing traits. 49 QTLs were identified for 13 yield traits and 7 QTLs for photosynthesis-related traits in BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2.</sub> In addition, 34 QTLs in BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub> and 26 QTLs in BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub> were also detected for yield traits.11 common QTLs were identified in three consecutive generations and their trait-increasing alleles were derived from O. rufipogon. Significantly, one major effect common QTL qTGW3.1 for thousand grain weight with average phenotypic variance 8.1% and one novel QTL qBM7.1 for biomass were identified. Photosynthesis-related QTLs qP<sub>N</sub>9.1, qP<sub>N</sub>12.1, qP<sub>N</sub>12.2 qSPAD1.1 and qSPAD6.1 showed additive effect from O. rufipogon. A set of 145 CSSLs were identified in BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> which together represented 87% of O. rufipogon genome. In addition, 87 of the 145 CSSLs were significantly different than MTU1010 for at least one trait. The major effect QTLs can be fine mapped for gene discovery. CSSLs developed in this study are a good source of novel alleles from O. rufipogon in the background of Cottondora Sannalu for rapid improvement of any trait in rice.
