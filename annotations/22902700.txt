Several hormones have been studied for their effect on tuber initiation and development. Until recently, the hormone with the most prominent role in tuber initiation was attributed to GA. Genes involved in GA degradation do exhibit an upregulated profile during early stages of tuber development, leading to a rapid decrease of active GA content, thereby facilitating stolon-tip swelling. While GA is known to be involved in shoot and stolon elongation, the development of the new tuberorgan requires changes in meristem identity and the reorientation ofthe plane of cell division. In other developmental processes, such as embryo patterning, flower development and lateral root initiation auxin plays a key role. Recent evidence on the involvement of auxin in tuber formation was providedby the measurement of auxin content in swelling stolons. Auxin content in the stolon tips increased several fold prior to tuber swelling. In vitro tuberisation experiments with auxin applications support the role of auxin during tuber initiation. Taken together, it is becoming clear that the initiation and induction of tubers in potato is a developmental process that appears to be regulated by a crosstalk between GA and auxin.
