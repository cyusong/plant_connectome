<i>Hygrophila polysperma</i> is a heterophyllous amphibious plant. The growth of <i>H. polysperma</i> in submerged conditions is challenging due to the low CO<sub>2</sub> environment, increased resistance to gas diffusion, and bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>) being the dominant dissolved inorganic carbon source. The submerged leaves of <i>H. polysperma</i> have significantly higher rates of underwater photosynthesis compared with the terrestrial leaves. 4,4'-Diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS), an anion exchanger protein inhibitor, and ethoxyzolamide (EZ), an inhibitor of internal carbonic anhydrase, repressed underwater photosynthesis by the submerged leaves. These results suggested that <i>H. polysperma</i> acclimates to the submerged condition by using HCO<sub>3</sub> <b><sup>-</sup></b> for photosynthesis. <i>H. polysperma</i> transports HCO<sub>3</sub> <b><sup>-</sup></b> into the leaf by a DIDS-sensitive HCO<sub>3</sub> <b><sup>-</sup></b> transporter and converted to CO<sub>2</sub> by carbonic anhydrase. Additionally, proteome analysis revealed that submerged leaves accumulated fewer proteins associated with C4 photosynthesis compared with terrestrial leaves. This finding suggested that <i>H. polysperma</i> is capable of C4 and C3 photosynthesis in the terrestrial and submerged leaves, respectively. The ratio of phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in the submerged leaves was less than that in the terrestrial leaves. Upon anatomical observation, the terrestrial leaves exhibited a phenotype similar to the Kranz anatomy found among C4 plants; however, chloroplasts in the bundle sheath cells were not located adjacent to the vascular bundles, and the typical Kranz anatomy was absent in submerged leaves. These results suggest that <i>H. polysperma</i> performs proto-Kranz type photosynthesis in a terrestrial environment and shifts from a proto-Kranz type in terrestrial leaves to a HCO<sub>3</sub> <b><sup>-</sup></b> use photosynthesis in the submerged environments.
