MAIN CONCLUSION : Large-scale comparative phosphoprotein analysis in maize seedlings reveals a complicated molecular regulation mechanism at the phosphoproteomic level during de-etiolation. In the present study we report a phosphoproteomic study conducted on Zea mays etiolated leaves harvested at three time points during greening (etiolated seedlings and seedlings exposed to light for 6 or 12 h). We identified a total of 2483 phosphopeptides containing 2389 unambiguous phosphosites from 1339 proteins. The abundance of nearly 692 phosphorylated peptides containing 783 phosphosites was reproducible and profiled with high confidence among treatments. Comparisons with other large-scale phosphoproteomic studies revealed that 473 of the phosphosites are novel to this study. Of the 783 phosphosites identified, 171, 79, and 138 were identified in 0, 6, and 12 h samples, respectively, which suggest that regulation of phosphorylation plays important roles during maize seedling de-etiolation. Our experimental methods included enrichment of phosphoproteins, allowing the identification of a great number of low abundance proteins, such as transcription factors, protein kinases, and photoreceptors. Most of the identified phosphoproteins were involved in gene transcription, post-transcriptional regulation, or signal transduction, and only a few were involved in photosynthesis and carbon metabolism. It is noteworthy that tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium signaling pathways might play important roles during maize seedling de-etiolation. Taken together, we have elucidated a new level of complexity in light-induced reversible protein phosphorylation during maize seedling de-etiolation.
