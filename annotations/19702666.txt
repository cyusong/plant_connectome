['19702666', 'Plants are able to sense and respond to changes in the balance between carbon (C)  and nitrogen (N) metabolite availability, known as the C/N response. During the  transition to photoautotrophic growth following germination, growth of seedlings  is arrested if a high external C/N ratio is detected. To clarify the mechanisms  for C/N sensing and signaling during this transition period, we screened a large  collection of FOX transgenic plants, overexpressing full-length cDNAs, for  individuals able to continue post-germinative growth under severe C/N stress. One  line, cni1-D (carbon/nitrogen insensitive 1-dominant), was shown to have a  suppressed sensitivity to C/N conditions at both the physiological and molecular  level. The CNI1 cDNA encoded a predicted RING-type ubiquitin ligase previously  annotated as ATL31. Overexpression of ATL31 was confirmed to be responsible for  the cni1-D phenotype, and a knock-out of this gene resulted in hypersensitivity  to C/N conditions during post-germinative growth. The ATL31 protein was confirmed  to contain ubiquitin ligase activity using an in vitro assay system. Moreover,  removal of this ubiquitin ligase activity from the overexpressed protein resulted  in the loss of the mutant phenotype. Taken together, these data demonstrated that  CNI1/ATL31 activity is required for the plant C/N response during seedling growth  transition.', '2009 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04006.x', 'Yamaguchi']
