['24357600', "TAP46 is a protein phosphatase2A (PP2A)-associated protein that regulates PP2A  activity in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To study how PP2A is involved in  abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in plants, we studied the function of TAP46 in  ABA-regulated seed maturation and seedling development. Expression of TAP46  coincides with the action of ABA in developing seeds and during seed germination,  and the TAP46 transcript reaches to the highest level in mature seeds. Real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis indicates that external ABA can increase TAP46  transcript level transiently during seed germination. Overexpression of TAP46  increases plant sensitivity to ABA, while tap46 knockdown mutants are less  sensitive to ABA during seed germination, suggesting that TAP46 functions  positively in ABA signaling. Overexpression of TAP46 also leads to lower PP2A  activity, while tap46-1 knockdown mutant displays higher PP2A activity,  suggesting that TAP46 negatively regulates PP2A activity in Arabidopsis. Both  TAP46 and PP2A interact with the ABA-regulated transcription factor ABA  INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) in vivo, and TAP46's binding to ABI5 can stabilize ABI5.  Furthermore, TAP46's binding to the phosphorylated ABI5 may prevent PP2A or  PP2A-like protein phosphatases from removing the phosphate from ABI5, thereby  maintaining ABI5 in its active form. Overexpression of TAP46 and inhibition of  activities of PP2A or PP2A-like protein phosphatases can increase transcript  levels of several ABI5-regulated genes, suggesting that TAP46 is a positive  factor in the ABA-regulated gene expression in Arabidopsis.", '2014 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.233684', 'Zhang']
