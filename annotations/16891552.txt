Transitivity, the spread of RNA silencing along primary target sequences, leads to the degradation of secondary targets that have no sequence homology to the initial silencing trigger. We demonstrate that increasing the distance between direct and adjacent target sequences in a transgenic primary target delays the onset of silencing of a secondary target gene. Silencing can spread in a 3' to 5' direction over a distance of at least 500 nucleotides (nt), but this requires consistently more time compared to a distance of 98 nt or 250 nt. The efficiency and frequency of transitive silencing of an endogene depends on the length of its sequence homology with the primary target. With a length of 500 nt, efficient silencing can eventually be established in all plants, whereas lengths of 250 nt and 98 nt homology result in less efficient and less frequent suppression. These results suggest that amplification of secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is a time-requiring process that gradually expands the population of siRNAs until a steady-state level is reached. Moreover, the length of the sequence homology in the primary target providing secondary siRNAs determines whether this steady-state level readily exceeds the threshold necessary for efficient silencing.
