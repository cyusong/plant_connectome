['11429606', "Oscillations in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) are central  regulators of signal transduction cascades, although the roles of individual  [Ca2+]cyt oscillation parameters in regulating downstream physiological responses  remain largely unknown. In plants, guard cells integrate environmental and  endogenous signals to regulate the aperture of stomatal pores and [Ca2+]cyt  oscillations are a fundamental component of stomatal closure. Here we  systematically vary [Ca2+]cyt oscillation parameters in Arabidopsis guard cells  using a 'calcium clamp' and show that [Ca2+]cyt controls stomatal closure by two  mechanisms. Short-term 'calcium-reactive' closure occurred rapidly when [Ca2+]cyt  was elevated, whereas the degree of long-term steady-state closure was 'calcium  programmed' by [Ca2+]cyt oscillations within a defined range of frequency,  transient number, duration and amplitude. Furthermore, in guard cells of the gca2  mutant, [Ca2+]cyt oscillations induced by abscisic acid and extracellular calcium  had increased frequencies and reduced transient duration, and steady-state  stomatal closure was abolished. Experimentally imposing [Ca2+]cyt oscillations  with parameters that elicited closure in the wild type restored long-term closure  in gca2 stomata. These data show that a defined window of guard cell [Ca2+]cyt  oscillation parameters programs changes in steady-state stomatal aperture.", '2001 Jun 28', 'Nature', '10.1038/35082575', 'Schroeder']
