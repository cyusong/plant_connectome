Highly efficient genetic transformation technology is greatly beneficial for crop gene function analysis and precision breeding. However, the most commonly used genetic transformation technology for woody plants, mediated by <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>, is time-consuming and inefficient, which limits its utility for gene function analysis. In this study, a simple, universal, and highly efficient genetic transformation technology mediated by <i>A. rhizogenes</i> K599 is described. This technology can be applied to multiple citrus genotypes, and only 2-8 weeks were required for the entire workflow. Genome-editing experiments were simultaneously conducted using 11 plasmids targeting different genomic positions and all corresponding transformants with the target knocked out were obtained, indicating that <i>A. rhizogenes</i>-mediated genome editing was highly efficient. In addition, the technology is advantageous for investigation of specific genes (such as <i>ACD2</i>) for obtaining "hard-to-get" transgenic root tissue. Furthermore, <i>A. rhizogenes</i> can be used for direct viral vector inoculation on citrus bypassing the requirement for virion enrichment in tobacco, which facilitates virus-induced gene silencing and virus-mediated gene expression. In summary, we established a highly efficient genetic transformation technology bypassing tissue culture in citrus that can be used for genome editing, gene overexpression, and virus-mediated gene function analysis. We anticipate that by reducing the cost, required workload, experimental period, and other technical obstacles, this genetic transformation technology will be a valuable tool for routine investigation of endogenous and exogenous genes in citrus.
