All aerial epidermal cells in land plants are covered by the cuticle, an extracellular hydrophobic layer that provides protection against abiotic and biotic stresses and prevents organ fusion during development. Genetic and morphological analysis of the classic maize adherent1 (ad1) mutant was combined with genome-wide binding analysis of the maize MYB transcription factor FUSED LEAVES1 (FDL1), coupled with transcriptional profiling of fdl1 mutants. We show that AD1 encodes an epidermally-expressed 3-KETOACYL-CoA SYNTHASE (KCS) belonging to a functionally uncharacterized clade of KCS enzymes involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis. Wax analysis in ad1 mutants indicates that AD1 functions in the formation of very-long-chain wax components. We demonstrate that FDL1 directly binds to CCAACC core motifs present in AD1 regulatory regions to activate its expression. Over 2000 additional target genes of FDL1, including many involved in cuticle formation, drought response and cell wall organization, were also identified. Our results identify a regulatory module of cuticle biosynthesis in maize that is conserved across monocots and eudicots, and highlight previously undescribed factors in lipid metabolism, transport and signaling that coordinate organ development and cuticle formation.
