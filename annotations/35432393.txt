RNA transcripts form various secondary and tertiary structures that have a wide range of regulatory functions. Several methods have been developed to profile <i>in vivo</i> RNA secondary structure in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These methods, such as dimethyl sulfate (DMS) mutational profiling with high-throughput sequencing (DMS-MaPseq), couple small chemical-mediated RNA modifications with next-generation sequencing. DMS-MaPseq, a powerful method for genome-wide and target-specific RNA secondary structure profiling, has been applied in yeast, mammals, <i>Drosophila</i>, and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, but not in crops. Here, we used DMS-MaPseq to conduct a target-specific and genome-wide profile of <i>in vivo</i> RNA secondary structure in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The DMS treatment conditions were optimized for rice leaf and root tissues. To increase the sequencing depth and coverage of low-abundance transcripts in genome-wide DMS-MaPseq, we used streptavidin-biotin depletion to reduce the abundance of highly expressed chloroplast transcripts during library construction. The resulting target-specific and genome-wide rice DMS-MaPseq data were of high quality and reproducibility. Furthermore, we used DMS-MaPseq to profile the <i>in vivo</i> RNA secondary structure of an OsmiR399 target region located at 5'UTR of <i>OsPHO2</i>, which participates in rice phosphate homeostasis. An unfolded RNA structure downstream of miRNA target site was observed in predicted <i>in vivo</i> RNA secondary structure, reminiscence of the TAM (Target Adjacent nucleotide Motif) involved in mRNA structure-mediated regulation in miRNA cleavage. Our study optimized DMS-MaPseq for probing <i>in vivo</i> RNA secondary structure in rice, facilitating the study of RNA structure-mediated regulations in crops.
