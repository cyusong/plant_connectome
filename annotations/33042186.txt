Wax apple is one of the most popular tropical fruit but undergoes serious post-harvest decay during storage, transportation and marketing. Melatonin (MT) plays important roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. However, its function in post-harvest preservation of fruit remains largely unknown. In the present study, the physiological function and molecular mechanism of exogenous MT for post-harvest preservation were evaluated in wax apple fruit. Results showed that MT treatment remarkably reduced decay incidence and the accumulation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) but increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, suggesting that exogenous MT alleviates the post-harvest decay of wax apple by regulating the balance between ROS production and antioxidant system. Meanwhile, the gene expression was analyzed by transcriptome confirmed by quantitative PCR. This study provides insights into the regulatory mechanism and proper application strategies for post-harvest preservation of wax apple and other fruits though melatonin manipulation.

Melatonin: !alleviates! Post-harvest decay
Exogenous MT: !reduces! Decay incidence
Exogenous MT: !increases! Antioxidant enzyme activity
ROS: !produces! Excess reactive oxygen species
Antioxidant system: !balances! ROS production
