['15728190', 'Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) transfer proteins (PITPs) regulate signaling  interfaces between lipid metabolism and membrane trafficking. Herein, we  demonstrate that AtSfh1p, a member of a large and uncharacterized Arabidopsis  thaliana Sec14p-nodulin domain family, is a PITP that regulates a specific stage  in root hair development. AtSfh1p localizes along the root hair plasma membrane  and is enriched in discrete plasma membrane domains and in the root hair tip  cytoplasm. This localization pattern recapitulates that visualized for  PtdIns(4,5)P2 in developing root hairs. Gene ablation experiments show AtSfh1p  nullizygosity compromises polarized root hair expansion in a manner that  coincides with loss of tip-directed PtdIns(4,5)P2, dispersal of secretory  vesicles from the tip cytoplasm, loss of the tip f-actin network, and manifest  disorganization of the root hair microtubule cytoskeleton. Derangement of  tip-directed Ca2+ gradients is also apparent and results from isotropic influx of  Ca2+ from the extracellular milieu. We propose AtSfh1p regulates intracellular  and plasma membrane phosphoinositide polarity landmarks that focus membrane  trafficking, Ca2+ signaling, and cytoskeleton functions to the growing root hair  apex. We further suggest that Sec14p-nodulin domain proteins represent a family  of regulators of polarized membrane growth in plants.', '2005 Feb 28', 'J Cell Biol', '10.1083/jcb.200412074', 'Bankaitis']
