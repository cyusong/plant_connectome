Flowering Chinese cabbage (<i>Brassica campestris</i> L. ssp. <i>chinensis</i> var. <i>utilis</i> Tsen et Lee, 2n=20, AA) is a vegetable species in southern parts of China that faces high temperatures in the summer and winter seasons. While heat stress adversely impacts plant productivity and survival, the underlying molecular and biochemical causes are poorly understood. This study investigated the gene expression profiles of heat-sensitive (HS) '3T-6' and heat-tolerant (HT) 'Youlu-501' varieties of flowering Chinese cabbage in response to heat stress using RNA sequencing. Among the 37,958 genes expressed in leaves, 20,680 were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 1, 6, and 12 h, with 1,078 simultaneously expressed at all time points in both varieties. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified three clusters comprising 1,958, 556, and 591 down-regulated, up-regulated, and up- and/or down-regulated DEGs (3205 DEGs; 8.44%), which were significantly enriched in MAPK signaling, plant-pathogen interactions, plant hormone signal transduction, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathways and involved in stimulus, stress, growth, reproductive, and defense responses. Transcription factors, including MYB (12), NAC (13), WRKY (11), ERF (31), HSF (17), bHLH (16), and regulatory proteins such as PAL, CYP450, and photosystem II, played an essential role as effectors of homeostasis, kinases/phosphatases, and photosynthesis. Among 3205 DEGs, many previously reported genes underlying heat stress were also identified, e.g., <i>BraWRKY25, BraHSP70, BraHSPB27, BraCYP71A23, BraPYL9</i>, and <i>BraA05g032350.3C</i>. The genome-wide comparison of HS and HT provides a solid foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of heat tolerance in flowering Chinese cabbage.
