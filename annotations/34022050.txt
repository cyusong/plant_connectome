The photosynthetic capacity of leaves is dramatically influenced by nitrogen (N) availability in the soil, as CO2 concentration in chloroplasts and photosynthetic biochemical capacity are related to leaf N content. The relationship between mesophyll conductance (gm) and leaf N content was expected to be shaped by leaf anatomical traits. However, the increased gm in mature leaves achieved by N top-dressing is unlikely to be caused by changes in leaf anatomy. Here, we assessed the impacts of N supply on leaf anatomical, biochemical, and photosynthetic features, specifically, the dynamic responses of leaf anatomy, biochemistry, and photosynthesis to N top-dressing in tobacco. Plant performance was substantially affected by soil N status. In comparison with the leaves of plants subjected to low N treatment, leaves of plants with high N treatment photosynthesized significantly more, due to higher CO2 diffusion conductance and photosynthetic biochemical capacity. The high gm in high N-treated leaves apparently related to modifications in the leaf anatomy; however, the rapid response of gm to N top-dressing cannot be fully explained by leaf anatomical modifications.
