The goals of this work were to screen physiological and biochemical indexes to assess a set of <i>V. vinifera</i> germplasm resources, to compare evaluation methods for cold hardiness, and to establish a comprehensive method that can be used for more accurate screening for cold hardiness in <i>V. vinifera.</i> Four single methods were used to evaluate the cold hardiness of 20 germplasms resources and 18 physiological and biochemical indexes related to cold hardiness were determined. The LT<sub>50</sub> values determined by electrical conductivity (EL), 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining (TTC), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and recovery growth (RG) methods showed extremely significant positive correlation. Bound water content (BW), proline content (Pro), total soluble sugar content (TSS), malondialdehyde content (MDA), catalase content (CAT), and ascorbic acid content (ASA) exhibited significant correlation with LT<sub>50</sub> values measured by different evaluation methods. The comprehensive cold hardiness index calculated by principal component analysis (PCA) combined with subordinate function (SF) was negatively correlated with LT<sub>50</sub> values measured by different evaluation methods. Meili and Ecolly exhibited the highest cold hardiness, indicating their potential for use as parents for cold hardiness breeding. EL, DTA, TTC, and RG methods successfully distinguished cold hardiness among different <i>V. vinifera</i> germplasm lines. Measurements of BW, Pro, TSS, MDA, CAT, and ASA in dormant shoots also can be used as main physiological and biochemical indexes related to cold hardiness of <i>V. vinifera</i>. Comprehensive evaluation by PCA combined with SF can accurately screen cold hardiness in <i>V. vinifera</i>. This study provides a reference and accurate identification method for the selection of cold hardiness parents and the evaluation of cold hardiness of germplasm of <i>V. vinifera</i>.
