Phosphate (Pi) deficiency is a major factor limiting plant productivity worldwide. Land plants have evolved different strategies to cope with Pi deficiency. For instance, plants activate the so-called Pi starvation response (PSR) system, which is regulated by the transcription factor Phosphate Starvation Response1 (PHR1), to adjust plant growth and metabolic activity accordingly. Additionally, land plants can also establish mutualistic associations with soil microbes able to solubilize Pi from plant-inaccessible soil complexes and to transfer it to the host plant. A growing body of evidence indicates that PHR1 and the PSR system not only regulate the plant responses to Pi deficiency in an abiotic context, but they are also crucial for plants to properly interact with beneficial soil microbes able to provide them with soluble Pi. Recent evidence indicates that PHR1 and the PSR system contribute to shaping the plant-associated microbiota through the modulation of the plant immune system. The PSR and immune system outputs are tightly integrated by PHR1. Here, we review how plant host Pi status influences the establishment of the mutualistic association with soil microbes. We also highlight the role of PHR1 and the PSR system in shaping both the root microbiome and plant responses to Pi deficiency.
