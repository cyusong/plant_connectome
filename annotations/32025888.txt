MAIN CONCLUSION: miR477 acts as a negative regulator in tea plant immunity against Pseudopestalotiopsis infection by repressing the expression of its target gene PAL. MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated post-transcriptional regulation plays a fundamental role in various plant physiological processes, including responses to pathogens. Our previous research revealed that miR477 might be involved in the tea plant-Pseudopestalotiopsis interaction (data not shown). In the present study, the accumulation of miR477 significantly decreased in tea plants during Pseudopestalotiopsis species infection. Using miRNA and degradome data sets, the targeting of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) by miR477 was validated by 5' RLM-RACE. GUS assay showed that the expression of PAL was post-transcriptionally regulated by miR477 and silenced by mRNA cleavage. A negative correlation between the expression of miR477 and PAL was found in tea plants infected by the pathogen. The transgenic lines overexpressing Csn-miR477 exhibited increased susceptibility to Pseudopestalotiopsis species, which was associated with reduced expression of PAL during infection. The degree of severity of the leaf lesions and the results of trypan blue staining showed that the plants overexpressing Csn-miR477 exhibited more severe damage upon pathogen infection than wild-type plants. In addition, more H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, higher malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and less superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities were detected in the transgenic plants than in the wild-type plants after inoculation with Pseudopestalotiopsis species. Taken together, our results implied that Csn-miR477 might act as a negative regulator in pathogen-infected tea plants by inhibiting the expression of its target, PAL, and that Csn-miR477 is a candidate miRNA for improving the adaptation of tea plant to disease.
