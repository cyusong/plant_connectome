Flower color patterns play critical roles in plant-pollinator interactions and represent one of the most common adaptations during angiosperm evolution. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying flower color pattern formation are less understood in non-model organisms. The aim of this study was to identify genes involved in the formation of petal blotches in tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosa) through transcriptome profiling and functional experiments. We identified an R2R3-MYB gene, PsMYB12, representing a distinct R2R3-MYB subgroup, with a spatiotemporal expression pattern tightly associated with petal blotch development. We further demonstrated that PsMYB12 interacts with a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and a WD40 protein in a regulatory complex that directly activates PsCHS expression, which is also specific to the petal blotches. Together, these findings advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pigment pattern formation beyond model plants. They also benefit molecular breeding of tree peony cultivars with novel color patterns and promote germplasm innovation.
