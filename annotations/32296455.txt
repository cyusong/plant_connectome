['32296455', 'Leaf senescence is a programmed developmental process regulated by various  endogenous and exogenous factors. Here we report the characterization of the  senescence-regulating role of DEAR4 (AT4G36900) from the DREB1/CBF  (dehydration-responsive element binding protein 1/C-repeat binding factor) family  in Arabidopsis. The expression of DEAR4 is associated with leaf senescence and  can be induced by ABA, JA, darkness, drought and salt stress. Transgenic plants  over-expressing DEAR4 showed a dramatically enhanced leaf senescence phenotype  under normal and dark conditions while the dear4 knock-down mutant displayed  delayed senescence. DEAR4 over-expressing plants showed decreased seed  germination rate under ABA and salt stress conditions as well as decreased  drought tolerance, indicating that DEAR4 was involved in both senescence and  stress response processes. Furthermore, we found that DEAR4 protein displayed  transcriptional repressor activities in yeast cells. DEAR4 could directly repress  the expression of a subset of COLD-REGULATED (COR) and RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION  (RD) genes which have been shown to be involved in leaf longevity and stress  response. Also we found that DERA4 could induce the production of Reactive oxygen  species (ROS), the common signal of senescence and stress responses, which gives  us the clue that DEAR4 may play an integrative role in senescence and stress  response via regulating ROS production.', '2020', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2020.00367', 'Guo']
