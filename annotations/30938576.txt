Our study investigated disease resistance in the <i>Brassica napus</i>-<i>Leptosphaeria maculans</i> pathosystem using a combination of laser microdissection, dual RNA sequencing, and physiological validations of large-scale gene sets. The use of laser microdissection improved pathogen detection and identified putative <i>L. maculans</i> effectors and lytic enzymes operative during host colonization. Within 24 h of inoculation, we detected large shifts in gene activity in resistant cotyledons associated with jasmonic acid and calcium signaling pathways that accelerated the plant defense response. Sequencing data were validated through the direct quantification of endogenous jasmonic acid levels. Additionally, resistance against <i>L. maculans</i> was abolished when the calcium chelator EGTA was applied to the inoculation site, providing physiological evidence of the role of calcium in <i>B. napus</i> immunity against <i>L. maculans</i>. We integrated gene expression data with all available information on cis-regulatory elements and transcription factor binding affinities to better understand the gene regulatory networks underpinning plant resistance to hemibiotrophic pathogens. These in silico analyses point to early cellular reprogramming during host immunity that are coordinated by CAMTA, BZIP, and bHLH transcription factors. Together, we provide compelling genetic and physiological evidence into the programming of plant resistance against fungal pathogens.
