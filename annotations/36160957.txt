Melting permafrost mounds in subarctic palsa mires are thawing under climate warming and have become a substantial source of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. However, mechanistic insights into the permafrost thaw-induced N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in these unique habitats remain elusive. We demonstrated that N<sub>2</sub>O emission potential in palsa bogs was driven by the bacterial residents of two dominant <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses especially of <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> (SC) in the subarctic palsa bog, which responded to endogenous and exogenous <i>Sphagnum</i> factors such as secondary metabolites, nitrogen and carbon sources, temperature, and pH. SC's high N<sub>2</sub>O emission activity was linked with two classes of distinctive hyperactive N<sub>2</sub>O emitters, including <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. and <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> bacteria, whose hyperactive N<sub>2</sub>O emitting capability was characterized to be dominantly pH-responsive. As the <i>nosZ</i> gene-harboring emitter, <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. SC-H2 reached a high level of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions that increased significantly with increasing pH. For emitters lacking the <i>nosZ</i> gene, <i>an Enterobacteriaceae</i> bacterium SC-L1 was more adaptive to natural acidic conditions, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions also increased with pH. Our study revealed previously unknown hyperactive N<sub>2</sub>O emitters in <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> found in melting palsa mound environments, and provided novel insights into SC-associated N<sub>2</sub>O emissions.
