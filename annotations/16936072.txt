['16936072', 'Loss-of-function mutants of the Arabidopsis thaliana ACAULIS 5 (ACL5) gene, which  encodes spermine synthase, exhibit a severe dwarf phenotype. To elucidate the  ACL5-mediated regulatory pathways of stem internode elongation, we isolated four  suppressor of acaulis (sac) mutants that reverse the acl5 dwarf phenotype.  Because these mutants do not rescue the dwarfism of known phytohormone-related  mutants, the SAC genes appear to act specifically on the ACL5 pathways. We  identify the gene responsible for the dominant sac51-d mutant, which almost  completely suppresses the acl5 phenotype. sac51-d disrupts a short upstream open  reading frame (uORF) of SAC51, which encodes a bHLH-type transcription factor.  Our results indicate that premature termination of the uORF in sac51-d results in  an increase in its own transcript level, probably as a result of an increased  translation of the main ORF. We suggest a model in which ACL5 plays a role in the  translational activation of SAC51, which may lead to the expression of a subset  of genes required for stem elongation.', '2006 Sep', 'Development', '10.1242/dev.02535', 'Takahashi']
