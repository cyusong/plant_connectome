The establishment of galls and syncytia as feeding sites induced by root-knot and cyst nematodes, respectively, involves a progressive increase in nuclear and cellular size. Here we describe the functional characterization of endocycle activators CCS52A, CCS52B and a repressor of the endocycle, DEL1, during two types of nematode feeding site development in Arabidopsis thaliana. In situ hybridization analysis showed that expression of CCS52A1 and CCS52B was strongly induced in galls and syncytia and DEL1 was stably but weakly expressed throughout feeding site development. Down-regulation and over-expression of CCS52 and DEL1 in Arabidopsis drastically affected giant cell and syncytium growth, resulting in restrained nematode development, illustrating the need for mitotic activity and endo-reduplication for feeding site maturation. Exploiting the mechanism of endo-reduplication may be envisaged as a strategy to control plant-parasitic nematodes.
