A gene fis1 from flax (Linum usitatissimum), which is induced in mesophyll cells at the site of rust (Melampsora lini) infection, is also expressed in vascular tissue, particularly in floral structures of healthy plants. This paper reports that the promoter controlling this expression is contained within 282 bp 5' to the coding region and that fis1 gene induction is specifically by the rust pathogen and not by other fungal pathogens or by wounding. The fis1 gene has 73% homology with an Arabidopsis gene which encodes delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH) which is a part of the proline degradation pathway. Transgenic flax plants that either over-express fis1 or show reduced fis1 expression due to RNA-mediated gene silencing have an unaltered morphology. However, plants with reduced fis1 expression have markedly increased sensitivity to exogenous proline and show alteration in epidermal cell morphology, callose deposition and the production of hydrogen peroxide during proline-induced death. These lines, which show a biologically significant level of fis1 suppression, have an unaltered reaction to either virulent or avirulent rust infections, as do fis1 over-expression lines. These data indicate that the fis1 gene plays a role in proline metabolism and most likely encodes for a P5CDH enzyme. However, the precise role of fis1 and P5C catabolism in the development of rust disease remains unclear.
