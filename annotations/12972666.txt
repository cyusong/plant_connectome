['12972666', 'In addition to proton-pumping complex I, plant mitochondria contain several type  II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases in the electron transport chain. The extra enzymes  allow the nonenergy-conserving electron transfer from cytoplasmic and matrix  NAD(P)H to ubiquinone. We have investigated the type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenase  gene families in Arabidopsis. This model plant contains two and four genes  closely related to potato (Solanum tuberosum) genes nda1 and ndb1, respectively.  A novel homolog, termed ndc1, with a lower but significant similarity to potato  nda1 and ndb1, is also present. All genes are expressed in several organs of the  plant. Among the nda genes, expression of nda1, but not nda2, is dependent on  light and circadian regulation, suggesting separate roles in  photosynthesis-associated and other respiratory NADH oxidation. Genes from all  three gene families encode proteins exclusively targeted to mitochondria, as  revealed by expression of green fluorescent fusion proteins and by western  blotting of fractionated cells. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that ndc1  affiliates with cyanobacterial type II NADH dehydrogenase genes, suggesting that  this gene entered the eukaryotic cell via the chloroplast progenitor. The ndc1  should then have been transferred to the nucleus and acquired a signal for  mitochondrial targeting of the protein product. Although they are of different  origin, the nda, ndb, and ndc genes carry an identical intron position.', '2003 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.103.024208', 'Rasmusson']
