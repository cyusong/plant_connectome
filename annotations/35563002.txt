<i>Trifolium repens</i> (<i>T. repens</i>) can accumulate significant amounts of heavy metal ions, and has strong adaptability to wide environmental conditions, and relatively large biomass, which is considered a potential plant for phytoremediation. However, the molecular mechanisms of <i>T. repens</i> involved in Cd tolerance have not yet been studied in detail. This study was conducted to examine the integrative responses of <i>T. repens</i> exposed to a high-level CdCl<sub>2</sub> by investigating the physiological and transcriptomic analyses. The results suggested that <i>T. repens</i> seedlings had a high degree of tolerance to Cd treatment. The roots accumulated higher Cd concentration than leaves and were mainly distributed in the cell wall. The content of MDA, soluble protein, the relative electrolyte leakage, and three antioxidant enzymes (POD, SOD, and APX) was increased with the Cd treatment time increasing, but the CAT enzymes contents were decreased in roots. Furthermore, the transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) mainly enriched in the glutathione (GSH) metabolism pathway and the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in the roots. Overexpressed genes in the lignin biosynthesis in the roots might improve Cd accumulation in cell walls. Moreover, the DEGs were also enriched in photosynthesis in the leaves, transferase activity, oxidoreductase activity, and ABA signal transduction, which might also play roles in reducing Cd toxicity in the plants. All the above, clearly suggest that <i>T. repens</i> employ several different mechanisms to protect itself against Cd stress, while the cell wall biosynthesis and GSH metabolism could be considered the most important specific mechanisms for Cd retention in the roots of <i>T. repens</i>.
