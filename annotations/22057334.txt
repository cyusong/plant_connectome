WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) genes are plant specific transcription factors that serve as master switches controlling key developmental programs from embryo apical-basal asymmetric patterning to organizing stem cells and development of lateral organs. Recently, we reported the requirement of a WOX1/MAW-like gene, STENOFOLIA (STF), for blade outgrowth and leaf vascular patterning in Medicago truncatula and Nicotiana sylvestris. The stf mutant in Medicago produces narrow leaves where mediolateral outgrowth of the blade is severely curtailed while proximodistal growth and trifoliate identity remain unaffected. The lam1 mutant in N. sylvestris produces leaves devoid of blade tissue with just 1-2 layers of rudimentary strips and lacks stem elongation. stf and lam1 mutants have narrow petals and are female sterile due to defective ovule development. Morphological analysis of mutants and STF expression patterns suggest that STF regulates blade outgrowth mainly by controlling cell division in the margins of leaf primordium. Both the blade and flower phenotypes of lam1 can be complemented with WUS expressed under the STF promoter suggesting a conserved mechanism in stem cell maintenance and lateral organ development.
