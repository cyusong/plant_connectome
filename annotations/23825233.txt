The life cycle of a leaf can be characterized as consisting of different stages: from primordial leaf initiation in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to leaf senescence. Leaf development, from early leaf growth to senescence, is tightly controlled by plant development and the environment. Here, we primarily focus on summarizing current evidence indicating that photo-oxidative stress occurs at the two extremes of a leaf's lifespan. Some recent studies clearly indicate that--as happens in senescing leaves--emerging new leaves suffer from photo-oxidative stress, which suggests that oxidative stress plays a key role at both ends of the leaf life cycle. We discuss the causes and consequences of suffering from photo-oxidative stress during leaf development, paying attention to the particularities of this process at the two extremes of leaf development. Of particular importance is the current evidence showing mechanisms that maintain an adequate cellular reactive oxygen species/antioxidant (redox) balance that allows growth and prevents oxidative damage in young emerging leaves, while later on photo-oxidative stress induces cell death in senescing leaves. Also of interest is the fact that reductions in the efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry may not necessarily indicate photo-oxidative stress in emerging leaves. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of photoinhibition, photoprotection, and photo-oxidative stress at the two ends of the leaf life cycle: early leaf growth and leaf senescence.
