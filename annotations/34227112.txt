Parastagonospora nodorum is a fungal pathogen of wheat. As a necrotrophic specialist, it deploys effector proteins that target dominant host susceptibility genes to elicit programmed cell death (PCD). Here we identify and functionally validate the effector targeting the host susceptibility genes Snn2, Snn6 and Snn7. We utilized whole-genome sequencing, association mapping, gene-disrupted mutants, gain-of-function transformants, virulence assays, bioinformatics and quantitative PCR to characterize these interactions. A single proteinaceous effector, SnTox267, targeted Snn2, Snn6 and Snn7 to trigger PCD. Snn2 and Snn6 functioned cooperatively to trigger PCD in a light-dependent pathway, whereas Snn7-mediated PCD functioned in a light-independent pathway. Isolates harboring 20 SnTox267 protein isoforms quantitatively varied in virulence. The diversity and distribution of isoforms varied between populations, indicating adaptation to local selection pressures. SnTox267 deletion resulted in the upregulation of effector genes SnToxA, SnTox1 and SnTox3. We validated a novel effector operating in an inverse-gene-for-gene manner to target three genetically distinct host susceptibility genes and elicit PCD. The discovery of the complementary gene action of Snn2 and Snn6 indicates their potential function in a guard or decoy model. Additionally, differences in light dependency in the elicited pathways and upregulation of unlinked effectors sheds new light onto a complex fungal necrotroph-host interaction.
