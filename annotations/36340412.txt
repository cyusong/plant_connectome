Plants are often faced with an array of adverse environmental conditions and must respond appropriately to grow and develop. In angiosperms, the plant hormone ethylene is known to play a protective role in responses to abiotic stress. Here we investigated whether ethylene mediates resistance to abiotic stress in the liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, one of the most distant land plant relatives of angiosperms. Using existing <i>M. polymorpha</i> knockout mutants of Mp<i>ein3</i>, and Mp<i>ctr1</i>, two genes in the ethylene signaling pathway, we examined responses to heat, salinity, nutrient deficiency, and continuous far-red light. The Mp<i>ein3</i> and Mp<i>ctr1</i> mutants were previously shown to confer ethylene insensitivity and constitutive ethylene responses, respectively. Using mild or sub-lethal doses of each stress treatment, we found that Mp<i>ctr1</i> mutants displayed stress resilience similar to or greater than the wild type. In contrast, Mp<i>ein3</i> mutants showed less resilience than the wild type. Consistent with ethylene being a stress hormone, we demonstrated that ethylene production is enhanced by each stress treatment. These results suggest that ethylene plays a role in protecting against abiotic stress in <i>M. polymorpha</i>, and that ethylene has likely been conserved as a stress hormone since before the evolutionary divergence of bryophytes from the land plant lineage approximately 450 Ma.
