Cotton fiber elongation is a critical growth phase that affects final fiber length. Morphological analysis indicated an asynchronous fiber elongation pattern between two cotton varieties, J7-1 and J14-1. Through phosphoproteomic analysis, a total of 89 differentially-phosphorylated proteins (DPPs) were identified in elongating fibers between J7-1 and J14-1. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that these DPPs were mainly enriched in sucrose synthase activity, transferase activity, and UDP-glycosyltransferase activity. In J14-1, the phosphorylation level of GhSUS2, a key sucrose synthase in the sucrose metabolism pathway, was significantly higher than that in J7-1. We further revealed that GhSUS2 positively regulates fiber elongation, and GhSUS2-silenced transgenic cotton displayed the phenotype of 'short fibers' compared with the controls. During fiber development, the residue Ser11 in the GhSUS2 protein is phosphorylated by the Ca2+-dependent protein kinases GhCPK84 and GhCPK93. Phosphorylated GhSUS2 is localized in the cytoplasm, whereas unphosphorylated GhSUS2 is localized in the plasma membrane. Moreover, abscisic acid (ABA) could promote the transcription and translation of GhCPK84 and GhCPK93, thereby enhancing the phosphorylation of GhSUS2 to impede fiber elongation. Thus, our data demonstrates that GhSUS2 plays a positive role in fiber development, but its phosphorylation by GhCPK84 and GhCPK93 hinders fiber elongation of cotton.
