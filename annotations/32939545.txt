['32939545', 'Eukaryotic cells rely on the accuracy and efficiency of vesicular traffic. In  plants, disturbances in vesicular trafficking are well studied in quickly  dividing root meristem cells or polar growing root hairs and pollen tubes. The  development of the female gametophyte, a unique haploid reproductive structure  located in the ovule, has received far less attention in studies of vesicular  transport. Key molecules providing the specificity of vesicle formation and its  subsequent recognition and fusion with the acceptor membrane are Rab proteins.  Rabs are anchored to membranes by covalently linked geranylgeranyl group(s) that  are added by the Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (RGT) enzyme. Here we show that  Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in the gene encoding the beta-subunit of RGT  (rgtb1) exhibit severely disrupted female gametogenesis and this effect is of  sporophytic origin. Mutations in rgtb1 lead to internalization of the PIN1 and  PIN3 proteins from the basal membranes to vesicles in provascular cells of the  funiculus. Decreased transport of auxin out of the ovule is accompanied by auxin  accumulation in tissue surrounding the growing gametophyte. In addition, female  gametophyte development arrests at the uni- or binuclear stage in a significant  portion of the rgtb1 ovules. These observations suggest that communication  between the sporophyte and the developing female gametophyte relies on  Rab-dependent vesicular traffic of the PIN1 and PIN3 transporters and auxin  efflux out of the ovule.', '2021 Feb 2', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/eraa430', 'Gutkowska']
