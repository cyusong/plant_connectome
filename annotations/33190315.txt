Soybean (Glycine max) yields are threatened by multiple stresses including soil salinity. GmSALT3 (a cation-proton exchanger protein) confers net shoot exclusion for both Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> and improves salt tolerance of soybean; however, how the ER-localized GmSALT3 achieves this is unknown. Here, GmSALT3's function was investigated in heterologous systems and near isogenic lines that contained the full-length GmSALT3 (NIL-T; salt-tolerant) or a truncated transcript Gmsalt3 (NIL-S; salt-sensitive). GmSALT3 restored growth of K<sup>+</sup> -uptake-defective Escherichia coli and contributed towards net influx and accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> in Xenopus laevis oocytes, while Gmsalt3 was non-functional. Time-course analysis of NILs confirmed shoot Cl<sup>-</sup> exclusion occurs distinctly from Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion. Grafting showed that shoot Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion occurs via a root xylem-based mechanism; in contrast, NIL-T plants exhibited significantly greater Cl<sup>-</sup> content in both the stem xylem and phloem sap compared to NIL-S, indicating that shoot Cl<sup>-</sup> exclusion likely depends upon novel phloem-based Cl<sup>-</sup> recirculation. NIL-T shoots grafted on NIL-S roots contained low shoot Cl<sup>-</sup> , which confirmed that Cl<sup>-</sup> recirculation is dependent on the presence of GmSALT3 in shoots. Overall, these findings provide new insights on GmSALT3's impact on salinity tolerance and reveal a novel mechanism for shoot Cl<sup>-</sup> exclusion in plants.
