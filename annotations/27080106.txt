['27080106', 'Phosphorus is a macronutrient taken up by cells as inorganic phosphate (P(i)).  How cells sense cellular P(i) levels is poorly characterized. Here, we report  that SPX domains--which are found in eukaryotic phosphate transporters, signaling  proteins, and inorganic polyphosphate polymerases--provide a basic binding  surface for inositol polyphosphate signaling molecules (InsPs), the  concentrations of which change in response to P(i) availability. Substitutions of  critical binding surface residues impair InsP binding in vitro, inorganic  polyphosphate synthesis in yeast, and P(i) transport in Arabidopsis In plants,  InsPs trigger the association of SPX proteins with transcription factors to  regulate P(i) starvation responses. We propose that InsPs communicate cytosolic  P(i) levels to SPX domains and enable them to interact with a multitude of  proteins to regulate P(i) uptake, transport, and storage in fungi, plants, and  animals.', '2016 May 20', 'Science', '10.1126/science.aad9858', 'Mayer']
