Here we document phenotypic differences between serpentine and nonserpentine ecotypes of Collinsia sparsiflora, as well as patterns of selection in these contrasting soil habitats. We transplanted the two parental ecotypes and experimental F2 hybrids into six field sites, and collected morphological, phenological and fitness data on emergent plants. To focus on edaphically mediated selection, rather than on pollinator-mediated selection, we used pollinator-exclusion cages. Transplanted parentals of the two ecotypes showed genetic differentiation for floral traits, but not for phenological traits or cotyledon size. For the F2 hybrids growing on serpentine soils, there was significant directional selection on cotyledon size, flower size and flower shape. However, the pattern of selection did not differ significantly between serpentine and nonserpentine sites. Overall, we did not see evidence for divergent selection on the two soil types. We conclude that differences in floral traits between the ecotypes do not reflect adaptation to physical conditions associated with soil type, and that there are unmeasured traits that must be contributing to ecotypic differentiation.
