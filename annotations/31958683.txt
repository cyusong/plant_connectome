Drought stress is one of the most devastating abiotic stresses, compromising crop growth, reproductive success and yield. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis has been demonstrated to be beneficial in helping the plant to bear with water deficit. In plants, development and stress responses are largely regulated by a complex hormonal crosstalk. Auxins play significant roles in plant growth and development, in responses to different abiotic stresses or in the establishment and functioning of the AM symbiosis. Despite these important functions, the role of indole-3acetic acid (IAA) as a regulator of root water transport and stress response is not well understood. In this study, the effect of exogenous application of IAA on the regulation of root radial water transport in AM plants was analyzed under well-watered and drought stress conditions. Exogenous IAA application affected root hydraulic parameters, mainly osmotic root hydraulic conductivity (Lo), which was decreased in both AM and non-AM plants under water deficit conditions. Under drought, the relative apoplastic water flow was differentially regulated by IAA application in non-AM and AM plants. The effect of IAA on the internal cell component of root water conductivity suggests that aquaporins are involved in the IAA-dependent inhibition of this water pathway.
