As sessile organisms, plants need to respond to rapid changes in numerous environmental factors, mainly diurnal changes of light, temperature, and humidity. Maize is the world's most grown crop, and as a C4 plant it exhibits high photosynthesis capacity, reaching the highest rate of net photosynthesis at midday; that is, there is no "midday depression." Revealing the physiological responses to diurnal changes and underlying mechanisms will be of great significance for guiding maize improvement efforts. In this study, we collected maize leaf samples and analyzed the proteome and phosphoproteome at nine time points during a single day/night cycle, quantifying 7424 proteins and 5361 phosphosites. The new phosphosites identified in our study increased the total maize phosphoproteome coverage by 8.5%. Kinase-substrate network analysis indicated that 997 potential substrates were phosphorylated by 20 activated kinases. Through analysis of proteins with significant changes in abundance and phosphorylation, we found that the response to a heat stimulus involves a change in the abundance of numerous proteins. By contrast, the high light at noon and rapidly changing light conditions induced changes in the phosphorylation level of proteins involved in processes such as chloroplast movement, photosynthesis, and C4 pathways. Phosphorylation is involved in regulating the activity of large number of enzymes; for example, phosphorylation of S55 significantly enhanced the activity of maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase1 (ZmPEPCK1). Overall, the database of dynamic protein abundance and phosphorylation we have generated provides a resource for the improvement of C4 crop plants.
