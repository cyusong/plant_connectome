Auxin and gibberellins (GAs) overlap in the regulation of multiple aspects of plant development, such as root growth and organ expansion. This coincidence raises questions about whether these two hormones interact to regulate common targets and what type of interaction occurs in each case. Auxins induce GA biosynthesis in a range of plant species. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of the auxin regulation of expression of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes encoding GA 20-oxidases and GA 3-oxidases involved in GA biosynthesis, and GA 2-oxidases involved in GA inactivation. Our results show that auxin differentially up-regulates the expression of various genes involved in GA metabolism, in particular several AtGA20ox and AtGA2ox genes. Up-regulation occurred very quickly after auxin application; the response was mimicked by incubations with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and was blocked by treatments with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The effects of auxin treatment reflect endogenous regulation because equivalent changes in gene expression were observed in the auxin overproducer mutant yucca. The results suggest direct regulation of the expression of GA metabolism genes by Aux/IAA and ARF proteins. The physiological relevance of this regulation is supported by the observation that the phenotype of certain gain-of-function Aux/IAA alleles could be alleviated by GA application, which suggests that changes in GA metabolism mediate part of auxin action during development.
