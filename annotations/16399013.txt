A protocol was developed for plant regeneration from encapsulated shoot tips collected from in vitro proliferated shoots of Withania somnifera. The best gel composition was achieved using 3% sodium alginate and 75 mM CaCl2.2H2O. The maximum percentage response (87%) for conversion of encapsulated shoot tips into plantlets was achieved on MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/l IBA after 5 weeks of culture. The conversion of encapsulated shoot tips into plantlets also occurred when calcium alginate beads having entrapped propagules were directly sown in autoclaved soilrite moistened with 14-MS salts.
