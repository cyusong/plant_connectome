The generation of haploid plants accelerates the crop breeding process. One of the haploidization strategies is based on the genetic manipulation of endogenous centromere-specific histone 3 (CENH3). To extend the haploidization toolbox, we tested whether targeted in vivo degradation of CENH3 protein can be harnessed to generate haploids in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that a recombinant anti-GFP nanobody fused to either heterologous F-box (NSlmb) or SPOP/BTB ligase proteins can recognize maternally derived enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-tagged CENH3 in planta and make it accessible for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Outcrossing of the genomic CENH3-EYFP-complemented cenh3.1 mother with plants expressing the GFP-nanobody-targeted E3 ubiquitin ligase resulted in a haploid frequency of up to 7.6% in pooled F1 seeds. EYFP-CENH3 degradation occurred independently in embryo and endosperm cells. In reciprocal crosses, no haploid induction occurred. We propose that the uniparental degradation of EYFP-fused genomic CENH3 during early embryogenesis leads to a decrease in its level at centromeres and subsequently weakens the centromeres. The male-derived wild type CENH3 containing centromere outcompetes the CENH3-EYFP depleted centromere. Consequently, maternal chromosomes undergo elimination, resulting in haploids.
