AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 (ARF3), one of the auxin response factors family of transcription factors, is well characterized by its functions in polarity identification and organ patterning. We recently demonstrated that ARF3 plays important roles in floral meristem (FM) maintenance and termination by regulating cytokinin biosynthesis and signaling. However, the relationship of its multiple roles in differently developmental stage is still unclear. Here, we present data that ARF3 plays distinct roles during early flower development that are different from its roles in organ polarity determination and pattering. Thus, our findings shed light on the functional diversity of one specific transcription factor in plant development.
