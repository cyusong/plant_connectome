['11672433', 'The enzyme fructose-6-phosphate 2-kinase (F6P,2K;  6-phosphofructo-2-kinase)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (F26BPase) catalyses the  formation and degradation of the regulatory metabolite fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.  A cDNA encoding the bifunctional plant enzyme isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana  (AtF2KP) was expressed in yeast, and the substrate affinities and allosteric  properties of the affinity-purified enzyme were characterized. In addition to the  known regulators 3-phosphoglycerate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, fructose  6-phosphate and P(i), several metabolites were identified as important new  effectors. PP(i), phosphoenolpyruvate and 2-phosphoglycerate strongly inhibited  F6P,2K activity, whereas fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and 6-phosphogluconate  inhibited F26BPase activity. Furthermore, pyruvate was an activator of F6P,2K and  an inhibitor of F26BPase. Both kinase and phosphatase activities were rapidly  inactivated by mild heat treatment (42 degrees C, 10 min), but the presence of  phosphate protected both enzyme activities from inactivation. In addition to the  catalytic regions, the Arabidopsis enzyme comprises a 345-amino-acid N-terminus  of unknown function. The role of this region was examined by the expression of a  series of N-terminally truncated enzymes. The full-length and truncated enzymes  were analysed by gel-filtration chromatography. The full-length enzyme was eluted  as a homotetramer, whereas the truncated enzymes were eluted as monomers.  Deletion of the N-terminus decreased the kinase/phosphatase activity ratio by  4-fold, and decreased the affinity for the substrate fructose 6-phosphate. The  data show that the N-terminus is important both for subunit assembly and for  defining the kinetic properties of the enzyme.', '2001 Nov 1', 'Biochem J', '10.1042/0264-6021:3590591', 'Nielsen']
