['16262716', 'The Arabidopsis GATA transcription factor family has 30 members, the biological  function of most of which is poorly understood. Homozygous T-DNA insertion lines  for 23 of the 30 members were identified and analyzed. Genetic screening of the  insertion lines in defined growth conditions revealed one line with an altered  phenotype, while the other lines showed no obvious change. This line,  SALK_001778, has a T-DNA insertion in the second exon of At5g56860 which prevents  the expression of the GATA domain. Genetic analysis of the mutant demonstrated  that the phenotypic change is caused by a single gene effect and is recessive to  the wild-type allele. In wild-type plants, the expression of At5g56860 is  shoot-specific, occurs at an early stage of development and is inducible by  nitrate. Loss of expression of At5g56860 in the loss-of-function mutant plants  resulted in reduced chlorophyll levels. A transcript profiling experiment  revealed that a considerable proportion of genes downregulated in the  loss-of-function mutants are involved in carbon metabolism and At5g56860 is thus  designated GNC (GATA, nitrate-inducible, carbon metabolism-involved). gnc mutants  with no GNC expression are more sensitive to exogenous glucose, and two hexose  transporter genes, with a possible connection to glucose signaling, are  significantly downregulated, while GNC over-expressing transgenic plants  upregulate their expression and are less sensitive to exogenous glucose. These  observations suggest a function for GNC in regulating carbon and nitrogen  metabolism.', '2005 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02568.x', 'Rothstein']
