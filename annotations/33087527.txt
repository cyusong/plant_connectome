Aluminum (Al) is a primary constraint for crop production on acid soils, which make up more than 30% of the arable land in the world. Al resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is achieved by malate secretion mediated by the Al-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (AtALMT1) transporter. The C2H2-type transcription factor SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1) is essential and required for Al resistance, where it acts by inducing the expression of Al-resistance genes, including <i>AtALMT1</i> In this study, we report that STOP1 protein function is modified by SUMOylation. The SMALL UBIQUITIN-LIKE MODIFIER (SUMO) protease ESD4, but not other SUMO proteases, specifically interacts with and deSUMOylates STOP1. Mutation of <i>ESD4</i> increases the level of STOP1 SUMOylation and the expression of the STOP1-regulated gene <i>AtALMT1</i>, which contributes to the increased Al resistance in <i>esd4</i> The <i>esd4</i> mutation does not influence STOP1 protein abundance but increases the association of STOP1 with the <i>AtALMT1</i> promoter, which might explain the elevated expression of <i>AtALMT1</i> in <i>esd4</i> We demonstrate that STOP1 is mono-SUMOylated at K40, K212, or K395 sites, and blocking STOP1 SUMOylation reduces STOP1 stability and the expression of STOP1-regulated genes, leading to the reduced Al resistance. Our results thus reveal the involvement of SUMOylation in the regulation of STOP1 and Al resistance in Arabidopsis.
