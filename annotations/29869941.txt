The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) MoMkk1 governs the cell-wall integrity (CWI) pathway in rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. To understand the underlying mechanism, we have identified MoSsb1 as one of the MoMkk1-interacting proteins. MoSsb1 is a stress-seventy subfamily B (Ssb) protein homolog, sharing high amino acid sequence homology with the 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70s). Hsp70 are a family of conserved and ubiquitously expressed chaperones that regulate protein biogenesis by promoting protein folding, preventing protein aggregation, and controlling protein degradation. We found that MoSsb1 regulates the synthesis of nascent polypeptide chains and this regulation is achieved by being in complex with other members of Hsp70s MoSsz1 and 40-kDa Hsp40 MoZuo1. MoSsb1 is important for the growth, conidiation, and full virulence of the blast fungus and this role is also shared by MoSsz1 and MoZuo1. Importantly, MoSsb1, MoSsz1, and MoZuo1 are all involved in the regulation of the CWI MAPK pathway by modulating MoMkk1 biosynthesis. Our studies reveal novel insights into how MoSsb1, MoSsz1, and MoZuo1 affect CWI signaling that is involved in regulating growth, differentiation, and virulence of M. oryzae and highlight the conserved functional mechanisms of heat-shock proteins in pathogenic fungi.
