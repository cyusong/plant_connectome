The development of climate change resilient crops is necessary if we are to meet the challenge of feeding the growing world's population. We must be able to increase food production despite the projected decrease in arable land and unpredictable environmental conditions. This review summarizes the technological and conceptual advances that have the potential to transform plant breeding, help overcome the challenges of climate change, and initiate the next plant breeding revolution. Recent developments in genomics in combination with high-throughput and precision phenotyping facilitate the identification of genes controlling critical agronomic traits. The discovery of these genes can now be paired with genome editing techniques to rapidly develop climate change resilient crops, including plants with better biotic and abiotic stress tolerance and enhanced nutritional value. Utilizing the genetic potential of crop wild relatives (CWRs) enables the domestication of new species and the generation of synthetic polyploids. The high-quality crop plant genome assemblies and annotations provide new, exciting research targets, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and cis-regulatory regions. Metagenomic studies give insights into plant-microbiome interactions and guide selection of optimal soils for plant cultivation. Together, all these advances will allow breeders to produce improved, resilient crops in relatively short timeframes meeting the demands of the growing population and changing climate.
