Jasmonic acid and derivatives are oxylipin signaling compounds derived from linolenic acid. Jasmonates accumulate during natural and dark-induced senescence but the increase in these compounds is not essential for the initiation or progression of these senescence processes. Here we report that during natural and dark-induced senescence the increase in jasmonate levels does not trigger jasmonate signaling. Furthermore we provide evidence that jasmonate production might result from membrane turnover during dark-induced senescence.

Jasmonic acid: !accumulates during! natural and dark-induced senescence 
jasmonate levels: !do not trigger! jasmonate signaling 
membrane turnover: !results in! jasmonate production
