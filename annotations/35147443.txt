Rhizosphere-competent microbes often interact with plant roots and exhibit beneficial effects on plant performance. Numerous bacterial and fungal isolates are able to prime host plants for fast adaptive responses against pathogen attacks. Combined action of fungi and bacteria may lead to synergisms exceeding effects of single strains. Individual beneficial fungi and bacteria have been extensively studied in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, but little is known about their concerted actions in the Brassicaceae. Here, an in-vitro system with oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) was established. Roots of two different cultivars were inoculated with well-characterized fungal (<i>Trichoderma harzianum</i> OMG16) and bacterial (<i>Bacillus velezensis</i> FZB42) isolates alone or in combination. Microscopic analysis confirmed that OMG16 hyphae entered root hairs through root hair tips and formed distinct intracellular structures. Quantitative PCR revealed that root colonization of OMG16 increased up to 10-fold in the presence of FZB42. Relative transcript levels of the ethylene- and jasmonic acid-responsive genes <i>PDF1.2</i>, <i>ERF2</i>, and <i>AOC3</i> were recorded in leaves by quantitative reverse transcription PCR to measure induced systemic resistance in tissues distant from the roots. Combined action of OMG16 and FZB42 induced transcript abundances more efficiently than single inoculation. Importantly, microbial priming reduced <i>Verticillium longisporum</i> root infection in rapeseed by approximately 100-fold compared with nonprimed plants. Priming also led to faster and stronger systemic responses of the defense genes <i>PDF1.2</i>, <i>ERF2</i>, <i>AOC3</i>, and <i>VSP2</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).
