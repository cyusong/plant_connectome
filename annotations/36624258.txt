Doubled haploid technology can accelerate plant breeding and its two main steps are haploid induction and subsequent doubled haploid production from fertile haploid plants. Although haploid female fertility is present to some extent in plants, the lack of haploid male fertility is a bottleneck. Herein, we demonstrate that mutations in the parallel spindle genes are sufficient to restore haploid male fertility in Arabidopsis with no impact on haploid female fertility.

Mutations: !restore! Haploid male fertility 
Haploid female fertility: !present to some extent! in plants 
Parallel spindle genes: !sufficient to restore! Haploid male fertility 
Haploid male fertility: !lack of! a bottleneck
