Phytopathogens use secreted effector proteins to suppress host immunity and promote pathogen virulence, and there is increasing evidence that the host-pathogen interactome comprises a complex network. To identify novel interactors of the <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> effector HopZ1a, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen that identified a previously uncharacterized <i>Arabidopsis</i> protein that we designate HopZ1a interactor 1 (ZIN1). Additional analyses in yeast and in planta revealed that ZIN1 also interacts with several other <i>P. syringae</i> effectors. We show that an <i>Arabidopsis</i> loss-of-function <i>zin1</i> mutant is less susceptible to infection by certain strains of <i>P. syringae</i>, while overexpression of <i>ZIN1</i> results in enhanced susceptibility. Functionally, ZIN1 exhibits topoisomerase-like activity in vitro. Transcriptional profiling of wild-type and <i>zin1 Arabidopsis</i> plants inoculated with <i>P. syringae</i> indicated that while ZIN1 regulates a wide range of pathogen-responsive biological processes, the list of genes more highly expressed in <i>zin1</i> versus wild-type plants is particularly enriched for ribosomal protein genes. Altogether, these data illuminate ZIN1 as a potential susceptibility hub that interacts with multiple effectors to influence the outcome of plant-microbe interactions.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
