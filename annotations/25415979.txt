Coated vesicles provide a major mechanism for the transport of proteins through the endomembrane system of plants. Transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi involves vesicles with COPI and COPII coats, whereas clathrin is the predominant coat in endocytosis and post-Golgi trafficking. Sorting of cargo, coat assembly, budding, and fission are all complex and tightly regulated processes that involve many proteins. The mechanisms and responsible factors are largely conserved in eukaryotes, and increasing organismal complexity tends to be associated with a greater numbers of individual family members. Among the key factors is the class of ENTH/ANTH/VHS domain-containing proteins, which link membrane subdomains, clathrin, and other adapter proteins involved in early steps of clathrin coated vesicle formation. More than 30 Arabidopsis thaliana proteins contain this domain, but their generally low sequence conservation has made functional classification difficult. Reports from the last two years have greatly expanded our knowledge of these proteins and suggest that ENTH/ANTH/VHS domain proteins are involved in various instances of clathrin-related endomembrane trafficking in plants. This review aims to summarize these new findings and discuss the broader context of clathrin-dependent plant vesicular transport.
