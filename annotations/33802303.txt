Chloroplasts cannot develop normally without the coordinated action of various proteins and signaling connections between the nucleus and the chloroplast genome. Many questions regarding these processes remain unanswered. Here, we report a novel P-type pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) factor, named Albino Cotyledon Mutant1 (ACM1), which is encoded by a nuclear gene and involved in chloroplast development. Knock-down of <i>ACM1</i> transgenic plants displayed albino cotyledons but normal true leaves, while knock-out of the <i>ACM1</i> gene in seedlings was lethal. Fluorescent protein analysis showed that ACM1 was specifically localized within chloroplasts. PEP-dependent plastid transcript levels and splicing efficiency of several group II introns were seriously affected in cotyledons in the RNAi line. Furthermore, denaturing gel electrophoresis and Western blot experiments showed that the accumulation of chloroplast ribosomes was probably damaged. Collectively, our results indicate <i>ACM1</i> is indispensable in early chloroplast development in <i>Arabidopsis</i> cotyledons.
