['11812229', 'In plant and microorganisms, aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASDH) produces  the branch point intermediate between the lysine and threonine/methionine  pathways. In this study, we report the first cDNA cloning, purification, and  characterization of a plant ASDH. The Arabidopsis thaliana ASDH is an homodimeric  enzyme composed of subunits of 36 kDa. The plant enzyme exhibited a specific  activity of 26 micromol NADPH oxidized min(-1) mg(-1) of protein with a K(M)  value for NADPH of 92 microM. ASDH showed cooperative behavior for aspartyl  phosphate with a K(0.5) value of 37 microM.', '2002 Feb', 'Protein Expr Purif', '10.1006/prep.2001.1538', 'Dumas']
