['17796728', 'In order to investigate the functional significance of membrane lipid  unsaturation, we have isolated a series of mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana which  are deficient in particular membrane fatty acids. The first of these mutants  completely lacks Delta3-trans-hexadecenoate, an acyl group that until now has  been thought to play an important role in the structure or function of thylakoid  membranes in photosynthetic eukaryotes. The apparent absence of any marked  physiological effect of the mutation illustrates the potential of this approach  to the analysis of membrane structure and function.', '1985 Feb 15', 'Science', '10.1126/science.227.4688.763', 'Somerville']
