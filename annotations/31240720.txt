Given their sessile nature, plants continuously face unfavorable conditions throughout their life cycle, including water scarcity, extreme temperatures and soil pollution. Among all, metal(loid)s are one of the main classes of contaminants worldwide, posing a serious threat to plant growth and development. When in excess, metals which include both essential and non-essential elements, quickly become phytotoxic, inducing the occurrence of oxidative stress. In this way, in order to ensure food production and safety, attempts to enhance plant tolerance to metal(loid)s are urgently needed. Nitric oxide (NO) is recognized as a signaling molecule, highly involved in multiple physiological events, like the response of plants to abiotic stress. Thus, substantial efforts have been made to assess NO potential in alleviating metal-induced oxidative stress in plants. In this review, an updated overview of NO-mediated protection against metal toxicity is provided. After carefully reviewing NO biosynthetic pathways, focus was given to the interaction between NO and the redox homeostasis followed by photosynthetic performance of plants under metal excess.
