['11161063', 'Trehalase is ubiquitous in higher plants. So far, indications concerning its  function are scarce, although it has been implicated in the detoxification of  exogenous trehalose. A putative trehalase gene, T19F6.15, has been identified in  the genome sequencing effort in Arabidopsis. Here we show that this gene encodes  a functional trehalase when its cDNA is expressed in yeast, and that it is  expressed in various plant organs. Furthermore, we present results on the  distribution and activity of trehalase in Arabidopsis and we describe how  inhibition of trehalase by validamycin A affects the plants response to exogenous  trehalose (alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-[1, 1]-alpha-D-glucopyranoside). Trehalase  activity was highest in floral organs, particularly in the anthers (approximately  700 nkat g(-1) protein) and maturing siliques (approximately 250 nkat g(-1)  protein) and much lower in leaves, stems, and roots (less than 50 nkat g(-1)  protein). Inhibition of trehalase in vivo by validamycin A led to the  accumulation of an endogenous substance that had all the properties of trehalose,  and to a strong reduction in sucrose and starch contents in flowers, leaves, and  stems. Thus, trehalose appears to be an endogenous substance in Arabidopsis, and  trehalose and trehalase may play a role in regulating the carbohydrate allocation  in plants.', '2001 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.125.2.1086', 'Wiemken']
