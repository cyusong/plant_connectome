Upon sensing attack by pathogens and insect herbivores, plants release complex mixtures of volatile compounds. Here, we show that the infection of lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) plants with the non-host bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato led to the production of microbe-induced plant volatiles (MIPVs). Surprisingly, the bacterial type III secretion system, which injects effector proteins directly into the plant cytosol to subvert host functions, was found to prime both intra- and inter-specific defense responses in neighbouring wild tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants. Screening of each of 16 effectors using the Pseudomonas fluorescens effector-to-host analyser revealed that an effector, HopP1, was responsible for immune activation in receiver tobacco plants. Further study demonstrated that 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanone and 3-octanol are novel MIPVs emitted by the lima bean plant in a HopP1-dependent manner. Exposure to synthetic 1-octen-3-ol activated immunity in tobacco plants against a virulent pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. Our results show for the first time that a bacterial type III effector can trigger the emission of C8 plant volatiles that mediate defense priming via plant-plant interactions. These results provide novel insights into the role of airborne chemicals in bacterial pathogen-induced inter-specific plant-plant interactions.
