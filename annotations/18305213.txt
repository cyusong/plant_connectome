['18305213', 'Oxidative respiration produces adenosine triphosphate through the mitochondrial  electron transport system controlling the energy supply of plant cells. Here we  describe a mitochondrial pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domain protein, PPR40,  which provides a signaling link between mitochondrial electron transport and  regulation of stress and hormonal responses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana). Insertion mutations inactivating PPR40 result in semidwarf growth  habit and enhanced sensitivity to salt, abscisic acid, and oxidative stress.  Genetic complementation by overexpression of PPR40 complementary DNA restores the  ppr40 mutant phenotype to wild type. The PPR40 protein is localized in the  mitochondria and found in association with Complex III of the electron transport  system. In the ppr40-1 mutant the electron transport through Complex III is  strongly reduced, whereas Complex IV is functional, indicating that PPR40 is  important for the ubiqinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity of Complex III.  Enhanced stress sensitivity of the ppr40-1 mutant is accompanied by accumulation  of reactive oxygen species, enhanced lipid peroxidation, higher superoxide  dismutase activity, and altered activation of several stress-responsive genes  including the alternative oxidase AOX1d. These results suggest a close link  between regulation of oxidative respiration and environmental adaptation in  Arabidopsis.', '2008 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.107.111260', 'Szabados']
