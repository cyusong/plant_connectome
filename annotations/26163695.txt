Small peptides of the Arabidopsis GLV/RGF/CLEL family are involved in different developmental programmes, including meristem maintenance and gravitropic responses. In addition, our previous report suggested that they also participate in the formation of lateral roots. Specifically, GLV6 is transcribed during the first stages of primordium development and GLV6 overexpression results in a strong reduction of emerged lateral roots. To investigate the cause of this phenotype we analysed primordium development in gain-of-function (gof) mutants and found that GLV6 induces supernumerary pericycle divisions, hindering the formation of a dome-shaped primordium, a prerequisite for successful emergence. The GLV6 phenotype could be reproduced by ectopic expression of the gene only in xylem-pole pericycle cells. Furthermore, GLV6 seems to function at the very beginning of lateral root initiation because GLV6 excess-either gene overexpression or peptide treatment-disrupts the first asymmetric cell divisions required for proper primordium formation. Our results suggest that GLV6 acts during lateral root initiation controlling the patterning of the first pericycle divisions.
