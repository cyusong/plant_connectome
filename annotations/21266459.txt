Yellow stripe-like (YSL) family transporters, belonging to a novel subfamily of oligopeptide transporter (OPT), has been proposed to be involved in metal uptake and long-distance transport, but only a few of them have been functionally characterized so far. In the present study, we isolated an uncharacterized member of the YSL family, HvYSL5, in barley based on expressed sequence tag (EST) information. HvYSL5 shared 50% identity with HvYS1, a transporter for the ferric-mugineic acid complex, at the amino acid level. Promoter analysis showed that the HvYSL5 upstream sequence contains both iron deficiency response element 1 and 2 (IDE1 and 2). HvYSL5 was expressed in the roots and the expression was greatly induced by Fe deficiency, but not by deficiency of other metals including Zn, Cu and Mn. Spatial investigation showed that much higher expression of HvYSL5 was found in the mature zones of the roots, but not in the root tips. Furthermore, the expression showed a diurnal rhythm, being the highest in the morning, but with no expression in the afternoon. HvYSL5 was localized in all root cells, and subcellular localization analysis showed that HvYSL5 is likely to be localized in the vesicles. Knockdown of HvYSL5 did not result in any detectable phenotype changes. Although the exact role of HvYSL5 remains to be examined, our results suggest that it is involved in the transient storage of Fe or phytosiderophores.
