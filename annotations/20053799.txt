['20053799', 'Phospholipase A enzymes cleave phospho- and galactolipids to generate free fatty  acids and lysolipids that function in animal and plant hormone signaling. Here,  we describe three Arabidopsis patatin-related phospholipase A (pPLA) genes  AtPLAIVA, AtPLAIVB, and AtPLAIVC and their corresponding proteins.  Loss-of-function mutants reveal roles for these pPLAs in roots during normal  development and under phosphate deprivation. AtPLAIVA is expressed strongly and  exclusively in roots and AtplaIVA-null mutants have reduced lateral root  development, characteristic of an impaired auxin response. By contrast, AtPLAIVB  is expressed weakly in roots, cotyledons, and leaves but is transcriptionally  induced by auxin, although AtplaIVB mutants develop normally. AtPLAIVC is  expressed in the floral gynaecium and is induced by abscisic acid (ABA) or  phosphate deficiency in roots. While an AtplaIVC-1 loss-of-function mutant  displays ABA responsiveness, it exhibits an impaired response to phosphate  deficiency during root development. Recombinant AtPLA proteins hydrolyze  preferentially galactolipids and, less efficiently, phospholipids, although these  enzymes are not localized in chloroplasts. We find that AtPLAIVA and AtPLAIVB are  phosphorylated by calcium-dependent protein kinases in vitro and this enhances  their activities on phosphatidylcholine but not on phosphatidylglycerol. Taken  together, the data reveal novel functions of pPLAs in root development with  individual roles at the interface between phosphate deficiency and auxin  signaling.', '2010 May', 'Mol Plant', '10.1093/mp/ssp109', 'Scherer']
