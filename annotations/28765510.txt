During gravitropism, the directional signal of gravity is perceived by gravity-sensing cells called statocytes, leading to asymmetric distribution of auxin in the responding organs. To identify the genes involved in gravity signaling in statocytes, we performed transcriptome analyses of statocyte-deficient <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants and found two candidates from the LAZY1 family, <i>AtLAZY1</i>/<i>LAZY1-LIKE1</i> (<i>LZY1</i>) and <i>AtDRO3</i>/<i>AtNGR1</i>/<i>LZY2</i> We showed that <i>LZY1</i>, <i>LZY2</i>, and a paralog <i>AtDRO1/AtNGR2/LZY3</i> are redundantly involved in gravitropism of the inflorescence stem, hypocotyl, and root. Mutations of <i>LZY</i> genes affected early processes in gravity signal transduction without affecting amyloplast sedimentation. Statocyte-specific expression of <i>LZY</i> genes rescued the mutant phenotype, suggesting that <i>LZY</i> genes mediate gravity signaling in statocytes downstream of amyloplast displacement, leading to the generation of asymmetric auxin distribution in gravity-responding organs. We also found that <i>lzy</i> mutations reversed the growth angle of lateral branches and roots. Moreover, expression of the conserved C-terminal region of LZY proteins also reversed the growth direction of primary roots in the <i>lzy</i> mutant background. In lateral root tips of <i>lzy</i> multiple mutants, asymmetric distribution of PIN3 and auxin response were reversed, suggesting that <i>LZY</i> genes regulate the direction of polar auxin transport in response to gravity through the control of asymmetric PIN3 expression in the root cap columella.
