Peroxisomes are a class of simple organelles that play an important role in plant reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Experimental evidence reveals the involvement of ROS in programmed cell death (PCD) in plants. Plant PCD is crucial for the regulation of plant growth, development and environmental stress resistance. However, it is unclear whether the ROS originated from peroxisomes participated in cellular PCD. Enzymes involved in the peroxisomal ROS metabolic pathways are key mediators to figure out the relationship between peroxisome-derived ROS and PCD. Here, we summarize the peroxisomal ROS generation and scavenging pathways and explain how peroxisome-derived ROS participate in PCD based on recent progress in the functional study of enzymes related to peroxisomal ROS generation or scavenging. We aimed to elucidate the role of the peroxisomal ROS regulatory system in cellular PCD to show its potential in terms of accurate PCD regulation, which contribute to environmental stress resistance.
