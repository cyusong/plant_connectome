['17905899', 'Posttranslational modifications of proteins by small ubiquitin-like modifiers  (SUMOs) regulate protein degradation and localization, protein-protein  interaction, and transcriptional activity. SUMO E3 ligase functions are executed  by SIZ1/SIZ2 and Mms21 in yeast, the PIAS family members RanBP2, and Pc2 in  human. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains only one gene, SIZ1, that is  orthologous to the yeast SIZ1/SIZ2. Here, we show that Arabidopsis SIZ1 is  expressed in all plant tissues. Compared with the wild type, the null mutant  siz1-3 is smaller in stature because of reduced expression of genes involved in  brassinosteroid biosynthesis and signaling. Drought stress induces the  accumulation of SUMO-protein conjugates, which is in part dependent on SIZ1 but  not on abscisic acid (ABA). Mutant plants of siz1-3 have significantly lower  tolerance to drought stress. A genome-wide expression analysis identified  approximately 1700 Arabidopsis genes that are induced by drought, with SIZ1  mediating the expression of 300 of them by a pathway independent of DREB2A and  ABA. SIZ1-dependent, drought-responsive genes include those encoding enzymes of  the anthocyanin synthesis pathway and jasmonate response. From these results, we  conclude that SIZ1 regulates Arabidopsis growth and that this SUMO E3 ligase  plays a role in drought stress response likely through the regulation of gene  expression.', '2007 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.049981', 'Chua']
