Field and pot experiments were conducted to explore the response mechanism of endogenous hormones of potential storage root to phosphorus and its relationship with yield and appearance quality of sweetpotato using five different rates of phosphorus addition. Application of adequate amounts of phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub> treatment, 112 kg of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> in field experiment or 0.04 g of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> in pot experiment) improved the yield and the appearance quality of sweetpotato when compared to the control treatment. This observation can be attributed to the fact that P<sub>2</sub> treatment significantly increased the expression of <i>Ibkn1</i> and <i>APRT</i> genes and the concentration of ZR from 20 to 40 days after planting, but the results were the opposite at 10 days after planting. In addition, an increase in the expression of <i>SRD1</i>, <i>NIT4</i>, <i>IbMADS1</i>, and <i>OPR3</i> and the concentrations of IAA and JA from day 10 to day 40 after planting were observed. Furthermore, the expression of <i>GA3oX4</i> and the concentration of GA<sub>3</sub> decreased significantly from 20 to 30 days of planting and significantly increased after 40 days of planting. Moreover, a significant decrease in the expression of <i>AAO</i> and concentration of ABA was observed from 10 to 30 days after planting, and a significant increase was observed after 40 days of planting. The results show that P<sub>2</sub> treatment promoted root development, particularly significantly increased the number of roots and potential storage roots. P<sub>2</sub> treatment significantly increased the diameter, weight, and number of storage roots at 40 days after planting. Finally, proper phosphorus application (112 kg of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup>) increased the yield (enhanced from 18.99 to 25.93%) by increasing the number of storage roots per plant and improving the appearance quality by increasing the length/diameter ratio and uniformity of storage root weight.
