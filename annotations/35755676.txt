CCT transcription factors are involved in the regulation of photoperiod and abiotic stress in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice. It is not clear that how CCT gene family expand and regulate heading date in foxtail millet. In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of the CCT gene family in foxtail millet. Thirty-nine CCT genes were identified and divided into four subfamilies based on functional motifs. Analysis showed that dispersed duplication played a predominant role in the expansion of CCT genes during evolution. Nucleotide diversity analysis suggested that genes in <i>CONSTANS</i> (<i>COL</i>)-like, <i>CCT MOTIF FAMILY</i> (<i>CMF</i>)-like, and pseudoresponse response regulator (PRR)-like subfamilies were subjected to selection. Fifteen CCT genes were colocalized with previous heading date quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) signals. Transgenic plants were then employed to confirm that overexpression of the CCT gene <i>SiPRR37</i> delayed the heading date and increased plant height. Our study first investigated the characterization and expansion of the CCT family in foxtail millet and demonstrated the role of <i>SiPRR37</i>. These results lay a significant foundation for further research on the function of CCT genes and provide a cue for the regulation of heading date.
