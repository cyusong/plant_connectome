Reversible protein phosphorylation is a widespread post-translational modification fundamental for signaling across all domains of life. Tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation has recently emerged as being important for plant receptor kinase (RK)-mediated signaling, particularly during plant immunity. How Tyr phosphorylation regulates RK function is however largely unknown. Notably, the expansion of protein Tyr phosphatase and SH2 domain-containing protein families, which are the core of regulatory phospho-Tyr (pTyr) networks in choanozoans, did not occur in plants. Here, we summarize the current understanding of plant RK Tyr phosphorylation focusing on the critical role of a pTyr site ('VIa-Tyr') conserved in several plant RKs. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of metazoan-like pTyr signaling modules in plants based on atypical components with convergent biochemical functions.
