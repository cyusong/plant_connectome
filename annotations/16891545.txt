Genes encoding defense-related proteins have been used to alter the resistance of plants to pathogens and other environmental challenges, but no single fungal gene overexpression has produced broad-spectrum stress resistance in transgenic lines. We have generated transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) lines that overexpress the endochitinases CHIT33 and CHIT42 from the mycoparasitic fungus Trichoderma harzianum and have evaluated their tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress. Both CHIT33 and CHIT42, individually, conferred broad resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens, salinity, and heavy metals. Such broad-range protective effects came off with no obvious detrimental effect on the growth of tobacco plants.

Gene: !encodes! Defense-related proteins 
Gene: !overexpresses! CHIT33 and CHIT42 
CHIT33/CHIT42: !confer! Broad resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens, salinity, and heavy metals 
CHIT33/CHIT42: !produce! Broad-range protective effects with no detrimental effect on growth
