Centipedegrass [<i>Eremochloa ophiuroides</i> (Munro) Hack.] is a perennial warm-season grass that originated in China, and its speed of nodal rooting is important for lawn establishment. In our study, centipedegrass nodal rooting ability was limited by node aging. Transcriptome sequencing of nodal roots after 0, 2, 4, and 8 days of water culture was performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of root development. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of DEGs indicated that plant hormone signal transduction and transcription factors might play important roles in centipedegrass nodal root growth. Among them, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases participated in multiple hormone signal transduction pathways and interacted with transcription factors. Furthermore, an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase <i>EoSINAT5</i> overexpressed in rice resulted in longer roots and more numerous root tips, while knockout of <i>LOC_Os07g46560</i> (the homologous gene of <i>EoSINAT5</i> in rice) resulted in shorter roots and fewer root tips. These results indicated that <i>EoSINAT5</i> and its homologous gene are able to promote nodal root development. This research presents the transcriptomic analyses of centipedegrass nodal roots, and may contribute to elucidating the mechanism governing the development of nodal roots and facilitates the use of molecular breeding in improving rooting ability.
