Plant hemoglobins are ubiquitous molecules involved in several aspects of plant development and stress responses. Studies on the functional aspects of plant hemoglobins at the cellular level in these processes are limited, despite their ability to scavenge nitric oxide (NO), an important signal molecule interfering with hormone synthesis and sensitivity. This mini-review summarizes current knowledge on plant hemoglobins, analyzes their participation in plant pathogen interaction and embryogenesis and proposes a possible model centering on jasmonic acid (JA) as a downstream component of hemoglobin responses.
