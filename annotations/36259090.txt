During stem elongation, wheat (Triticum aestivum) increases its stem carbohydrate content before anthesis as a reserve for grain filling. Hydraulic functioning during this mobilization process is not well understood, and contradictory results exist on the direct effect of drought on carbohydrate mobilization. In a dedicated experiment, wheat plants were subjected to drought stress during carbohydrate mobilization. Measurements, important to better understand stem physiology, showed some unexpected patterns that could not be explained by our current knowledge on water transport. Traditional water flow and storage models failed to properly describe the drought response in wheat stems during carbohydrate mobilization. To explain the measured patterns, hypotheses were formulated and integrated in a dedicated model for wheat. The new mechanistic model simulates two hypothetical water storage compartments: one where water is quickly exchanged with the xylem and one that contains the carbohydrate storage. Water exchange between these compartments is turgor-driven. The model was able to simulate the measured increase in stored carbohydrate concentrations with a decrease in water content and stem diameter. Calibration of the model showed the importance of turgor-driven apoplastic water flow during carbohydrate mobilization. This resulted in an increase in stem hydraulic capacitance, which became more important under drought stress.
