['16005292', 'Stomata, dynamic pores found on the surfaces of plant leaves, control water loss  from the plant and regulate the uptake of CO(2) for photosynthesis. Stomatal  aperture is controlled by the two guard cells that surround the stomatal pore.  When the two guard cells are fully turgid, the pore gapes open, whereas turgor  loss results in stomatal closure. In order to set the most appropriate stomatal  aperture for the prevailing environmental conditions, guard cells respond to  multiple internal and external signals. Although much is known about guard-cell  signaling pathways, rather little is known about how changes in gene expression  are involved in the control of stomatal aperture. We show here that AtMYB61  (At1g09540), a gene encoding a member of the Arabidopsis thaliana R2R3-MYB family  of transcription factors, is specifically expressed in guard cells in a manner  consistent with involvement in the control of stomatal aperture. Gain-of-function  and loss-of-function mutant analyses reveal that AtMYB61 expression is both  sufficient and necessary to bring about reductions in stomatal aperture with  consequent effects on gas exchange. Taken together, our data provide evidence  that AtMYB61 encodes the first transcription factor implicated in the closure of  stomata.', '2005 Jul 12', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.041', 'Campbell']
