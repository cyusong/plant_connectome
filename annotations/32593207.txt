Globally, fungal pathogens cause enormous crop losses and current control practices are not always effective, economical or environmentally sustainable. Tools enabling genetic management of wild pathogen populations could potentially solve many problems associated with plant diseases. A natural gene drive from a heterologous species can be used in the globally important cereal pathogen Fusarium graminearum to remove pathogenic traits from contained populations of the fungus. The gene drive element became fixed in a freely crossing population in only three generations. Repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), a natural genome defence mechanism in fungi that causes C to T mutations during meiosis in highly similar sequences, may be useful to recall the gene drive following release, should a failsafe mechanism be required. We propose that gene drive technology is a potential tool to control plant pathogens once its efficacy is demonstrated under natural settings.
