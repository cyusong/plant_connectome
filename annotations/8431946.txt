['8431946', 'We isolated a recessive Arabidopsis mutant, ctr1, that constitutively exhibits  seedling and adult phenotypes observed in plants treated with the plant hormone  ethylene. The ctr1 adult morphology can be phenocopied by treatment of wild-type  plants with exogenous ethylene and is due, at least in part, to inhibition of  cell elongation. Seedlings and adult ctr1 plants show constitutive expression of  ethylene-regulated genes. The epistasis of ctr1 and other ethylene response  mutants has defined the position of CTR1 in the ethylene signal transduction  pathway. The CTR1 gene has been cloned, and the DNA sequences of four mutant  alleles were determined. The gene encodes a putative serine/threonine protein  kinase that is most closely related to the Raf protein kinase family.', '1993 Feb 12', 'Cell', '10.1016/0092-8674(93)90119-b', 'Ecker']
