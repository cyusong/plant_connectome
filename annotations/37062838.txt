Understanding the stoichiometric characteristics and nutrient allocation strategies of dominant tree species in montane forest systems can provide a basis for decision-making in relation to montane system management. Therefore, according to precipitation and temperature gradients, we selected three typical areas in the Qilian Mountains on the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to analyse the spatial relations of plant-soil stoichiometric characteristics and nutrient allocation strategies of plant tissues for Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) along different environmental gradients. 1) The plant and soil stoichiometric characteristics had similar spatial patterns. The C content of plants and soils tended to decrease with increasing latitude, and the N and P contents and the N:P ratio tended to increase with increasing latitude. 2) The stoichiometric characteristics of the plant tissues also interacted with each other and showed synergistic trade-offs. Nutrient allocation in the eastern section of the Qilian Mountains was similar to that in the western section, while more N and P in the plant stems were allocated to maintain plant growth in the relatively arid western Sect. 3) The nutrient allocation strategies in the plant tissues were mainly regulated by soil and climate. Information on plant-soil stoichiometric characteristics along different gradients can help us better understand the nutrient patterns and dynamics of forest ecosystems under arid and semiarid conditions at a wide geographic scale from the perspective of plant nutrient partitioning.
