The inhibition of fructan accumulation by phosphate was investigated in warm-grown and cold-treated barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants. Detached leaves were incubated in water or phosphate for 24 h under lighting or in darkness. Fructosyltransferase, sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) activities were subsequently analysed, as well as the content of carbohydrates, hexose-phosphates, phosphate, amino acids and protein. In warm-grown leaves, phosphate decreased fructan accumulation and total carbon in carbohydrates and did not affect protein content. Phosphate increased hexose-phosphates, phosphate and amino acids. Fructosyltransferase and FBPase activities were not affected by phosphate feeding, while SPS activity was inhibited by phosphate in incubations in both light and darkness. In cold-treated leaves, which before incubation had higher SPS activities than warm-grown leaves, phosphate had no inhibitory effect on fructan accumulation, carbohydrate content or total C in carbohydrates. The activities of SPS and FBPase were unaffected by phosphate. The results indicate that phosphate decreases fructan accumulation through an inhibition of SPS whenever this activity is not high before a rise in phosphate content.
