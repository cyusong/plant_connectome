Peach (<i>Prunus persica</i> L. Batsch) trees grow vigorously and are subject to intense pruning during orchard cultivation. Reducing the levels of endogenous gibberellins (GAs) represents an effective method for controlling branch growth. Gibberellin 2-oxidases (GA2oxs) deactivate bioactive GAs, but little is known about the GA2ox gene family in peach. In this study, we identified seven <i>PpGA2ox</i> genes in the peach genome, which were clustered into three subgroups: C<sub>19</sub>-GA2ox-I, C<sub>19</sub>-GA2ox-II, and C<sub>20</sub>-GA2ox-I. Overexpressing representative genes from the three subgroups, <i>PpGA2ox-1</i>, <i>PpGA2ox-5</i>, and <i>PpGA2ox-2</i>, in tobacco resulted in dwarf plants with shorter stems and smaller leaves than the wild type. An analysis of the GA metabolic profiles of the transgenic plants showed that PpGA2ox-5 (a member of subgroup C<sub>19</sub>-GA2ox-II) is simultaneously active against both C<sub>19</sub>-GAs and C<sub>20</sub>-GAs,which implied that C<sub>19</sub>-GA2ox-II enzymes represent intermediates of C<sub>19</sub>-GA2oxs and C<sub>20</sub>-GA2oxs. Exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> treatment of shoot tips activated the expression of all seven <i>PpGA2ox</i> genes, with different response times: the <i>C</i> <sub>19</sub>-<i>GA2ox</i> genes were transcriptionally activated more rapidly than the <i>C<sub>20</sub>-GA2ox</i> genes. GA metabolic profile analysis suggested that C<sub>20</sub>-GA2ox depletes GA levels more broadly than C<sub>19</sub>-GA2ox. These results suggest that the <i>PpGA2ox</i> gene family is responsible for fine-tuning endogenous GA levels in peach. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for appropriately controlling the vigorous growth of peach trees.
