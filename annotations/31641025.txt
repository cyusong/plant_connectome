DNA binding-with-one-finger (Dof) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors closely associated with a variety of physiological processes. Here, we show that the Dof protein family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) functions in leaf senescence. Disruption of <i>Dof2</i> <i>1</i>, a jasmonate (JA)-inducible gene, led to a marked reduction in promotion of leaf senescence and inhibition of root development as well as dark-induced and age-dependent leaf senescence, while overexpression of <i>Dof2</i> <i>1</i> promoted these processes. Additionally, the <i>dof2</i> <i>1</i> knockout mutant showed almost no change in the transcriptome in the absence of JA; in the presence of JA, expression of many senescence-associated genes, including <i>MYC2</i>, which encodes a central regulator of JA responses, was induced to a lesser extent in the <i>dof2</i> <i>1</i> mutant than in the wild type. Furthermore, direct activation of the <i>MYC2</i> promoter by Dof2.1, along with the results of epistasis analysis, indicated that Dof2.1 enhances leaf senescence mainly by promoting <i>MYC2</i> expression. Interestingly, MYC2 was also identified as a transcriptional activator responsible for JA-inducible expression of <i>Dof2</i> <i>1</i> Based on these results, we propose that Dof2.1 acts as an enhancer of JA-induced leaf senescence through the MYC2-Dof2.1-MYC2 feedforward transcriptional loop.
