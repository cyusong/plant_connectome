['16753566', 'The cytokinin class of plant hormones plays key roles in regulating diverse  developmental and physiological processes. Arabidopsis perceives cytokinins with  three related and partially redundant receptor histidine kinases (HKs): CRE1 (the  same protein as WOL and AHK4), AHK2, and AHK3 (CRE-family receptors). It is  suggested that binding of cytokinins induces autophosphorylation of these HKs and  subsequent transfer of the phosphoryl group to a histidine phosphotransfer  protein (HPt) and then to a response regulator (RR), ultimately regulating  downstream signaling events. Here we demonstrate that, in vitro and in a yeast  system, CRE1 is not only a kinase that phosphorylates HPts in the presence of  cytokinin but is also a phosphatase that dephosphorylates HPts in the absence of  cytokinin. To explore the roles of these activities in planta, we replaced CRE1  with mutant versions of the gene or with AHK2. Replacing CRE1 with CRE1(T278I),  which lacks cytokinin binding activity and is locked in the phosphatase form,  decreased cytokinin sensitivity. Conversely, replacing CRE1 with AHK2, which  favors kinase activity, increased cytokinin sensitivity. These results indicate  that in the presence of cytokinins, cytokinin receptors feed phosphate to  phosphorelay-integrating HPt proteins. In the absence of cytokinins, CRE1 removes  phosphate from HPt proteins, decreasing the system phosphoload.', '2006 Jun 6', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2006.04.030', 'Kakimoto']
