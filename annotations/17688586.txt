Long-distance virus transport takes place through the vascular system and is dependent on the movement of photoassimilates. Here, patterns of symptom development, virus movement and gene expression were analysed in Arabidopsis following inoculation with Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) on a single leaf. Virus accumulation and expression of markers for the salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene/jasmonate (Et/JA) defence pathways, PR-1 and PDF1.2, were analysed on a leaf-by-leaf basis by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Virus spread followed a strictly defined pattern identical to that of a source-sink relationship. This was exploited to study differences between local and systemic defence responses in a developmental and spatial manner. In infected plants, PR-1 transcripts accumulated primarily but not exclusively in leaves with a direct vascular connection to the inoculated leaf. Abundances fell significantly as virus accumulated. By contrast, PDF1.2 transcripts were significantly lower than in controls in all leaves at early stages of infection, but recovered as virus accumulated. Virus and PR-1 transcript abundances are negatively correlated, and SA- and Et/JA-mediated signalling of gene expression occurs independently of the presence of virus. Although SA-dependent signalling responses were mainly linked to the orthostichy, Et/JA-dependent responses were independent of vascular connections.
