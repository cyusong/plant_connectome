['15976272', 'Pathogen recognition by the plant immune system is governed by structurally  related, polymorphic products of disease resistance (R) genes. RAR1 and/or SGT1b  mediate the function of many R proteins. RAR1 controls preactivation R protein  accumulation by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that Arabidopsis SGT1b has  two distinct, genetically separable functions in the plant immune system: SGT1b  antagonizes RAR1 to negatively regulate R protein accumulation before infection,  and SGT1b has a RAR1-independent function that regulates programmed cell death  during infection. The balanced activities of RAR1 and SGT1, in concert with  cytosolic HSP90, modulate preactivation R protein accumulation and signaling  competence.', '2005 Aug 5', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1109977', 'Dangl']
