Mimicking photosynthesis in generating chemical fuels from sunlight is a promising strategy to alleviate society's demand for fossil fuels. However, this approach involves a number of challenges that must be overcome before this concept can emerge as a viable solution to society's energy demand. Particularly in artificial photosynthesis, the catalytic chemistry that converts energy in the form of electricity into carbon-based fuels and chemicals has yet to be developed. Here, we describe the foundational work and future prospects of an emerging and promising class of materials: metal- and covalent-organic frameworks (MOFs and COFs). Within this context, these porous and tuneable framework materials have achieved initial success in converting abundant feedstocks (H<sub>2</sub> O and CO<sub>2</sub> ) into chemicals and fuels. In this review, we first highlight key achievements in this direction. We then follow with a perspective on precisely how MOFs and COFs can perform in ways not possible with conventional molecular or heterogeneous catalysts. We conclude with a view on how spectroscopically probing MOF and COF catalysis can be used to elucidate reaction mechanisms and material dynamics throughout the course of reaction.
