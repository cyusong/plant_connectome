Anthocyanin biosynthesis is induced by low temperatures in a number of plants. However, in peach (cv Zhonghuashoutao), anthocyanin accumulation was observed in fruit stored at 16°C but not at or below 12°C. Fruit stored at 16°C showed elevated transcript levels of genes encoding anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes, the transport protein glutathione S-transferase and key transcription factors. Higher transcript levels of PpPAL1/2, PpC4H, Pp4CL4/5/8, PpF3H, PpF3'H, PpDFR1/2/3 and PpANS, as well as transcription factor gene PpbHLH3, were associated with lower methylation levels in the promoter of these genes. The DNA methylation level was further highly correlated with the expression of the DNA methyltransferase genes and DNA demethylase genes. The application of DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine induced anthocyanin accumulation in peach flesh, further implicating a critical role for DNA demethylation in regulating anthocyanin accumulation in peach flesh. Our data reveal that temperature-dependent DNA demethylation is a key factor to the post-harvest temperature-dependent anthocyanin accumulation in peach flesh.
