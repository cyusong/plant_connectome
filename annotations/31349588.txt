Nitrogen (N) is one of the indispensable factors in rice growth and development. China holds a premier position in the production of rice and at the same time also faces higher N fertilizer costs along with serious damage to the environment. A better solution is much needed to address these issues, without disrupting the production of rice as an important cereal, while minimizing all the deleterious effects on the environment. Two isogenic lines Kitaake (WT) and its genetically modified line CIPK2 (RC), overexpressing the gene for Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase 2 (Os<i>CIPK2</i>) with better nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), were compared for their growth and development under low versus normal levels of N. NUE is a complex trait mainly related to a plant's efficiency in extraction, assimilation, and recycling of N from soil. The microbial population was analyzed using high-throughput Illumina Miseq 16S rRNA sequencing and found that RC with <i>CIPK2,</i> specifically expressed in rice root, not only performed better without nitrogen fertilizer (LN) but also increased the diversity of bacterial communities in rice rhizosphere compartments (rhizosphere, rhizoplane, and endosphere). The relative abundance of beneficial bacteria phyla increased, which are known to promote the circulation and transformation of N in rhizosphere soil. To further explore the potential of RC regarding better performance under LN, the ion fluxes in root apical were detected by non-invasive micro-test technique (NMT). We found that RC can absorb more Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> under LN as compared to WT. Finally, compared to WT, RC plants exhibited better growth of root and shoot, and increased yield and N uptake under LN, whereas there was no significant difference in the growth of two rice lines under normal nitrogen (NN) treatment. We are able to get preliminary results, dealing with the <i>OsCIPK2</i> overexpressed rice line, by studying the rice molecular, physiological, and chemical parameters related to NUE. The results laid the foundation for further research on N absorption and utilization in rice from the soil and the interaction with microbial communities.
