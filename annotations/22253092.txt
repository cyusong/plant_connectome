Histone acetylation ranks with DNA methylation as one of major epigenetic modifications in eukaryotes. Deacetylation of histone N-terminal tails is intimately correlated with gene silencing and heterochromatin formation. In Arabidopsis, histone deacetylase 6 (HDA6) is a well-studied histone deacetylase that functions in gene silencing. Recently, it has been reported that HDA6 cooperates with DNA methylation on its direct target locus in the gene silencing mechanism. HDA6 has the multifaceted role in regulation of genome maintenance, development and environmental stress responses in plants. Elucidation of HDA6 function provides important information for understanding of epigenetic regulation in plants. In this review, we highlight recent progress in elucidating the HDA6-mediated gene silencing mechanisms and deciphering the biological function of HDA6.
