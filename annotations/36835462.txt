Plant cell walls are essential structures for plant growth and development as well as plant adaptation to environmental stresses. Thus, plants have evolved signaling mechanisms to monitor the changes in the cell wall structure, triggering compensatory changes to sustain cell wall integrity (CWI). CWI signaling can be initiated in response to environmental and developmental signals. However, while environmental stress-associated CWI signaling has been extensively studied and reviewed, less attention has been paid to CWI signaling in relation to plant growth and development under normal conditions. Fleshy fruit development and ripening is a unique process in which dramatic alternations occur in cell wall architecture. Emerging evidence suggests that CWI signaling plays a pivotal role in fruit ripening. In this review, we summarize and discuss the CWI signaling in relation to fruit ripening, which will include cell wall fragment signaling, calcium signaling, and NO signaling, as well as Receptor-Like Protein Kinase (RLKs) signaling with an emphasis on the signaling of FERONIA and THESEUS, two members of RLKs that may act as potential CWI sensors in the modulation of hormonal signal origination and transduction in fruit development and ripening.
