Chinese goldthread (Coptis chinensis Franch.), a member of the Ranunculales, represents an important early-diverging eudicot lineage with diverse medicinal applications. Here, we present a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly and annotation of C. chinensis. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses reveal the phylogenetic placement of this species and identify a single round of ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) shared by the Ranunculaceae. We characterize genes involved in the biosynthesis of protoberberine-type alkaloids in C. chinensis. In particular, local genomic tandem duplications contribute to member amplification of a Ranunculales clade-specific gene family of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 719. The functional versatility of a key CYP719 gene that encodes the (S)-canadine synthase enzyme involved in the berberine biosynthesis pathway may play critical roles in the diversification of other berberine-related alkaloids in C. chinensis. Our study provides insights into the genomic landscape of early-diverging eudicots and provides a valuable model genome for genetic and applied studies of Ranunculales.
