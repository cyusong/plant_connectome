Salt tolerance quantitative trait loci analysis of rice has revealed that the SKC1 locus, which is involved in a higher K<sup>+</sup> /Na<sup>+</sup> ratio in shoots, corresponds to the OsHKT1;5 gene encoding a Na<sup>+</sup> -selective transporter. However, physiological roles of OsHKT1;5 in rice exposed to salt stress remain elusive, and no OsHKT1;5 gene disruption mutants have been characterized to date. In this study, we dissected two independent T-DNA insertional OsHKT1;5 mutants. Measurements of ion contents in tissues and <sup>22</sup> Na<sup>+</sup> tracer imaging experiments showed that loss-of-function of OsHKT1;5 in salt-stressed rice roots triggers massive Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in shoots. Salt stress-induced increases in the OsHKT1;5 transcript were observed in roots and basal stems, including basal nodes. Immuno-staining using an anti-OsHKT1;5 peptide antibody indicated that OsHKT1;5 is localized in cells adjacent to the xylem in roots. Additionally, direct introduction of <sup>22</sup> Na<sup>+</sup> tracer to leaf sheaths also demonstrated the involvement of OsHKT1;5 in xylem Na<sup>+</sup> unloading in leaf sheaths. Furthermore, OsHKT1;5 was indicated to be present in the plasma membrane and found to localize also in the phloem of diffuse vascular bundles in basal nodes. Together with the characteristic <sup>22</sup> Na<sup>+</sup> allocation in the blade of the developing immature leaf in the mutants, these results suggest a novel function of OsHKT1;5 in mediating Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion in the phloem to prevent Na<sup>+</sup> transfer to young leaf blades. Our findings further demonstrate that the function of OsHKT1;5 is crucial over growth stages of rice, including the protection of the next generation seeds as well as of vital leaf blades under salt stress.
