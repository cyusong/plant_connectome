Calcium acts as a signal and transmits information in all eukaryotes. Encoding machinery consisting of calcium channels, stores, buffers, and pumps can generate a variety of calcium transients in response to external stimuli, thus shaping the calcium signature. Mechanisms for the transmission of calcium signals have been described, and a large repertoire of calcium binding proteins exist that can decode calcium signatures into specific responses. Whilst straightforward as a concept, mysteries remain as to exactly how such information processing is biochemically implemented. Novel developments in imaging technology and genetically encoded sensors (such as calcium indicators), in particular for multi-signal detection, are delivering exciting new insights into intra- and intercellular calcium signaling. Here, we review recent advances in characterizing the encoding, transmission, and decoding mechanisms, with a focus on long-distance calcium signaling. We present technological advances and computational frameworks for studying the specificity of calcium signaling, highlight current gaps in our understanding and propose techniques and approaches for unravelling the underlying mechanisms.
