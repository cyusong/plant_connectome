Exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) has been extensively used to study jasmonate-dependent signaling events triggered by biotic stresses. MeJA application leads to complex jasmonate-dependent physiological responses, including changes in stomatal openness and induction of emissions of a multitude of volatile compounds. Whether the alterations in stomatal conductance and emissions of MeJA-induced volatiles are quantitatively associated with MeJA dose, and whether the induced volatile emissions are regulated by modifications in stomatal conductance had been poorly known until recently. Our latest studies highlighted a biphasic kinetics of jasmonate-dependent volatile emissions induced by MeJA treatment in the model species cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i>), indicating induction of an immediate stress response and subsequent gene-expression level response. Both the immediate and delayed responses were MeJA dose-dependent. The studies further demonstrated that stomata modulated the kinetics of emissions of water-soluble volatiles in a MeJA dose-dependent manner. These studies contribute to understanding of plant short- and long-term responses to different biotic stress severities as simulated by treatments with a range of MeJA doses corresponding to mild to acute stress.
