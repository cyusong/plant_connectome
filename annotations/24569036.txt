Light and temperature are arguably two of the most important signals regulating the growth and development of plants. In addition to their direct energetic effects on plant growth, light and temperature provide vital immediate and predictive cues for plants to ensure optimal development both spatially and temporally. While the majority of research to date has focused on the contribution of either light or temperature signals in isolation, it is becoming apparent that an understanding of how the two interact is essential to appreciate fully the complex and elegant ways in which plants utilize these environmental cues. This review will outline the diverse mechanisms by which light and temperature signals are integrated and will consider why such interconnected systems (as opposed to entirely separate light and temperature pathways) may be evolutionarily favourable.
