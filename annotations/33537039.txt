The salt overly sensitive (SOS) signal transduction pathway is one of the most highly studied salt tolerance pathways in plants. However, the molecular mechanism of the salt stress response in <i>Tamarix hispida</i> has remained largely unclear. In this study, five <i>SOS</i> genes (<i>ThSOS1</i>-<i>ThSOS5</i>) from <i>T. hispida</i> were cloned and characterized. The expression levels of most <i>ThSOS</i> genes significantly changed after NaCl, PEG<sub>6000</sub>, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment in at least one organ. Notably, the expression of <i>ThSOS3</i> was significantly downregulated after 6 h under salt stress. To further analyze <i>ThSOS3</i> function, <i>ThSOS3</i> overexpression and RNAi-mediated silencing were performed using a transient transformation system. Compared with controls, <i>ThSOS3</i>-overexpressing transgenic <i>T. hispida</i> plants exhibited greater reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging capability and antioxidant enzyme activity, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels, and lower electrolyte leakage rates under salt stress. Similar results were obtained for physiological parameters in transgenic Arabidopsis, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA accumulation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activity, and electrolyte leakage. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing <i>ThSOS3</i> displayed increased root growth and fresh weight gain under salt stress. Together, these data suggest that overexpression of <i>ThSOS3</i> confers salt stress tolerance on plants by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, improving ROS-scavenging capability, and decreasing the MDA content and lipid peroxidation of cell membranes. These results suggest that <i>ThSOS3</i> might play an important physiological role in salt tolerance in transgenic <i>T. hispida</i> plants. This study provides a foundation for further elucidation of salt tolerance mechanisms involving <i>ThSOS</i>s in <i>T. hispida</i>.
