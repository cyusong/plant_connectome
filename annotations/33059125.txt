Wild relatives of crops are often rich in genetic resources and provide great possibilities for crop improvement. Ipomoea pes-caprae is one of the wild relatives of sweet potato and has high salt tolerance. Transcriptomes in the treatment and control groups at various times were sequenced to identify salt tolerance genes and salt response pathways. A total of 40,525 genes were obtained, of which 2478 and 3334 were differentially expressed in the roots and leaves of I. pes-caprae under salt stress, respectively. Identification of candidate genes revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway of plants and plant hormone signal transduction participates in the salt signal of I. pes-caprae under salt stress. Homology to ABI2 (HAB2) and Clade A protein phosphatases type 2C (HAI1), which encode two protein phosphatases 2C (PP2C) in the abscisic acid (ABA) signal pathway, were continuously up-regulated upon salt stress, indicating their key role in the salt signal transduction pathway of I. pes-caprae. The expression of EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 (EBF1) in the ethylene signaling pathway was also up-regulated, revealing that the salt tolerance of I. pes-caprae was related to the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study provides insights into the mechanism of salt-tolerant plants and the mining of salt-tolerant genes in sweet potato for the innovation of germplasm resources.
