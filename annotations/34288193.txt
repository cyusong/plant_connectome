Thioredoxins (TRXs) are well-known redox signalling players, which carry out post-translational modifications in target proteins. Chloroplast TRXs are divided into different types and have central roles in light energy uptake and the regulation of primary metabolism. The isoforms TRX m1, m2, and m4 from Arabidopsis thaliana are considered functionally related. Knowing their key position in the hub of plant metabolism, we hypothesized that the impairment of the TRX m signalling would not only have harmful consequences on chloroplast metabolism but also at different levels of plant development. To uncover the physiological and developmental processes that depend on TRX m signalling, we carried out a comprehensive study of Arabidopsis single, double, and triple mutants defective in the TRX m1, m2, and m4 proteins. As light and redox signalling are closely linked, we investigated the response to high light (HL) of the plants that are gradually compromised in TRX m signalling. We provide experimental evidence relating the lack of TRX m and the appearance of novel phenotypic features concerning mesophyll structure, stomata biogenesis, and stomatal conductance. We also report new data indicating that the isoforms of TRX m fine-tune the response to HL, including the accumulation of the protective pigment anthocyanin. These results reveal novel signalling functions for the TRX m and underline their importance for plant growth and fulfilment of the acclimation/response to HL conditions.
