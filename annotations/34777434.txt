Glyphosate-resistant crops developed by the <i>CP4-EPSPS</i> gene from <i>Agrobacterium</i> have been planted on a massive scale globally, which benefits from the high efficiency and broad spectrum of glyphosate in weed control. Some glyphosate-resistant (GR) genes from microbes have been reported, which might raise biosafety concerns. Most of them were obtained through a hygromycin-<i>HPT</i> transformation system. Here we reported the plant source with 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene from goosegrass endowed rice with high resistance to glyphosate. The integrations and inheritability of the transgenes in the rice genome were investigated within two generations. The <i>EiEPSPS</i> transgenic plants displayed similar growth and development to wild type under no glyphosate selection pressure but better reproductive performance under lower glyphosate selection pressure. Furthermore, we reconstructed a binary vector pCEiEPSPS and established the whole stage glyphosate selection using the vector. The Glyphosate-pCEiEPSPS selection system showed a significantly higher transformation efficiency compared with the hygromycin-<i>HPT</i> transformation system. Our results provided a promising alternative gene resource to the development of GR plants and also extended the plant transformation toolbox.
