Abiotic stress is one of the main threats affecting crop growth and production. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underpin plant responses against environmental insults will be crucial to help guide the rational design of crop plants to counter these challenges. A key feature during abiotic stress is the production of nitric oxide (NO), an important concentration dependent, redox-related signalling molecule. NO can directly or indirectly interact with a wide range of targets leading to the modulation of protein function and the reprogramming of gene expression. The transfer of NO bioactivity can occur through a variety of potential mechanisms but chief among these is S-nitrosylation, a prototypic, redox-based, post-translational modification. However, little is known about this pivotal molecular amendment in the regulation of abiotic stress signalling. Here, we describe the emerging knowledge concerning the function of NO and S-nitrosylation during plant responses to abiotic stress.
