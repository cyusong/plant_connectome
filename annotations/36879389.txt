Methylglyoxal (MG), a toxic compound produced as a byproduct of several cellular processes, such as respiration and photosynthesis, is well known for its deleterious effects, mainly through glycation of proteins during plant stress responses. However, very little is known about its impact on fruit ripening. Here, we found that MG levels are maintained at high levels in green tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruits and decline during fruit ripening despite a respiratory burst during this transition. We demonstrate that this decline is mainly mediated through a glutathione-dependent MG detoxification pathway and primarily catalyzed by a glyoxalase I enzyme encoded by the SlGLYI4 gene. SlGLYI4 is a direct target of the MADS-box transcription factor RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN), and its expression is induced during fruit ripening. Silencing of SlGLYI4 leads to drastic MG overaccumulation at ripening stages of transgenic fruits and interferes with the ripening process. MG most likely glycates and inhibits key enzymes such as methionine synthase and S-adenosyl methionine synthase in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, thereby indirectly affecting fruit pigmentation and cell wall metabolism. MG overaccumulation in fruits of several non-ripening or ripening-inhibited tomato mutants suggests that the tightly regulated MG detoxification process is crucial for normal ripening progression. Our results underpin a SlGLYI4-mediated regulatory mechanism by which MG detoxification controls fruit ripening in tomato.
