Genetic mutations provide the heritable material for plant adaptation to their environments. At the same time, the environment can affect the mutation rate across plant genomes. However, the extent to which environmental plasticity in mutation rates can facilitate or hinder adaptation remains a longstanding and unresolved question. Emerging discoveries of mechanisms affecting mutation rate variability provide opportunities to consider this question in a new light. Links between chromatin states, transposable elements, and DNA repair suggest cases of adaptive mutation rate plasticity could occur. Yet, numerous evolutionary and biological forces are expected to limit the impact of any such mutation rate plasticity on adaptive evolution. Persistent uncertainty about the significance of mutation rate plasticity on adaptation motivates new experimental and theoretical research relevant to understanding plant responses in changing environments.
