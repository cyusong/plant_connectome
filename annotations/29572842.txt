Wood biosynthesis defines the chemical and structural properties of wood. The metabolic pathways that produce the precursors of wood cell wall polymers have a central role in defining wood properties. To make rational design of wood properties feasible, we need not only to understand the cell wall biosynthetic machinery, but also how sucrose transport and metabolism in developing wood connect to cell wall biosynthesis and how they respond to genetic and environmental cues. Here, we review the current understanding of the sucrose transport and primary metabolism pathways leading to the precursors of cell wall biosynthesis in woody plant tissues. We present both old, persistent questions and new emerging themes with a focus on wood formation in trees and draw upon evidence from the xylem tissues of herbaceous plants when it is relevant.
