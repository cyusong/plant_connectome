['26314500', 'YUCCA (YUC) proteins constitute a family of flavin monooxygenases (FMOs), with an  important role in auxin (IAA) biosynthesis. Here we report that Arabidopsis  plants overexpressing YUC6 display enhanced IAA-related phenotypes and exhibit  improved drought stress tolerance, low rate of water loss and controlled ROS  accumulation under drought and oxidative stresses. Co-overexpression of an  IAA-conjugating enzyme reduces IAA levels but drought stress tolerance is  unaffected, indicating that the stress-related phenotype is not based on IAA  overproduction. YUC6 contains a previously unrecognized FAD- and NADPH-dependent  thiol-reductase activity (TR) that overlaps with the FMO domain involved in IAA  biosynthesis. Mutation of a conserved cysteine residue (Cys-85) preserves FMO but  suppresses TR activity and stress tolerance, whereas mutating the FAD- and  NADPH-binding sites, that are common to TR and FMO domains, abolishes all  outputs. We provide a paradigm for a single protein playing a dual role,  regulating plant development and conveying stress defence responses.', '2015 Aug 28', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms9041', 'Yun']
