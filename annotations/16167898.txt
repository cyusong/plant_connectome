['16167898', 'The DELLA proteins GAI, RGA, RGL1 and RGL2 in Arabidopsis are plant growth  repressors, repressing diverse developmental processes. Studies have shown that  gibberellin (GA) attenuates the repressive function of DELLA proteins by  triggering their degradation via the proteasome pathway. However, it is not known  if GA-induced protein degradation is the only pathway for regulating the  bioactivity of DELLA proteins. We show here that tobacco BY2 cells represent a  suitable system for studying GA signaling. RGL2 exists in a phosphorylated form  in BY2 cells. RGL2 undergoes GA-induced degradation, and this process is blocked  by proteasome inhibitors and serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors; however,  serine/threonine kinase inhibitors had no detectable effect, suggesting that  dephosphorylation of serine/threonine is probably a prerequisite for degradation  of RGL2 via the proteasome pathway. Site-directed substitution of all 17  conserved serine and threonine residues showed that six mutants (RGL2(S441D,  RGL2(S542D), RGL2(T271E), RGL2(T319E), RGL2(T411E) and RGL2(T535E)) mimicking the  status of constitutive phosphorylation are resistant to GA-induced degradation.  This suggests that these sites are potential phosphorylation sites. A functional  assay based on the expression of GA 20-oxidase revealed that RGL2(T271E) is  probably a null mutant, RGL2(S441D), RGL2(S542D), RGL2(T319E) and RGL2(T411E)  only retained about 4-17% of the activity of the wild type RGL2, whereas  RGL2(T535E) retained about 66% of the activity of the wild type RGL2. However,  expression of GA 20-oxidase in BY2 cells expressing these mutant proteins is  still responsive to GA, suggesting that the stabilization of RGL2 protein is not  the only pathway for regulating its bioactivity.', '2005 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02512.x', 'Peng']
