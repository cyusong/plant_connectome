The CRISPR/Cas9 technology shows potential to improve crop breeding efficiency and antiviral defense. The interest in DNA editing in crops has grown due to the possibility of increasing the resistance of different plants to many viruses. Our aim was to create an elite disease-resistant local barley cultivar using CRISPR/Cas9 biotechnology. For this purpose, we used CRISPR/Cas 9-eIF4E with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) barley gene to edit the genomes of five local Kazakhstan barley cultivars. After identifying the single guide RNA (sgRNA) target sequences, they were synthesized and cloned into the CRISPR-plant vector before being introduced into barley cells via our own patented Agrobacterium germ-line transformation technique. Barley plants eIF4E-modified were successfully obtained and were resistant to virus infection. Based on our research, the CRISPR/Cas9 system for plant genome editing could be a prospect for applying this breakthrough biotechnology in barley breeding.
