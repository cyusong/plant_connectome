['18337510', 'Many aspects of plant development, including patterning and tropisms, are largely  dependent on the asymmetric distribution of the plant signaling molecule auxin.  Auxin transport inhibitors (ATIs), which interfere with directional auxin  transport, have been essential tools in formulating this concept. However,  despite the use of ATIs in plant research for many decades, the mechanism of ATI  action has remained largely elusive. Using real-time live-cell microscopy, we  show here that prominent ATIs such as 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) and  2-(1-pyrenoyl) benzoic acid (PBA) inhibit vesicle trafficking in plant, yeast,  and mammalian cells. Effects on micropinocytosis, rab5-labeled endosomal motility  at the periphery of HeLa cells and on fibroblast mobility indicate that ATIs  influence actin cytoskeleton. Visualization of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in  plants, yeast, and mammalian cells show that ATIs stabilize actin. Conversely,  stabilizing actin by chemical or genetic means interferes with endocytosis,  vesicle motility, auxin transport, and plant development, including auxin  transport-dependent processes. Our results show that a class of ATIs act as actin  stabilizers and advocate that actin-dependent trafficking of auxin transport  components participates in the mechanism of auxin transport. These studies also  provide an example of how the common eukaryotic process of actin-based vesicle  motility can fulfill a plant-specific physiological role.', '2008 Mar 18', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0711414105', 'Friml']
