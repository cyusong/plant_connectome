Fertilization constitutes a critical step in the plant life cycle during which the gamete genomes undergo chromatin dynamics in preparation for embryogenesis. In mammals, parental chromatin is extensively reprogrammed through the global erasure of DNA methylation. However, in flowering plants it remains unclear whether and how DNA methylation is remodeled in gametes and after fertilization in the zygote. In this study, we characterize DNA methylation patterns and investigate the function of DNA glycosylases in rice eggs, sperm, and unicellular zygotes and during embryogenesis. We found that DNA methylation is locally reconfigured after fertilization and is intensified during embryogenesis. Genetic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic analysis revealed that three rice DNA glycosylases, DNG702, DNG701, and DNG704, demethylate DNA at distinct genomic regions in the gametes and the zygote, and are required for zygotic gene expression and development. Collectively, these results indicate that active DNA demethylation takes place in the gametes and the zygote to locally remodel DNA methylation, which is critical for egg and zygote gene expression and reproduction in rice.
