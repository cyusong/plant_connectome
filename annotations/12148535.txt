['12148535', 'In higher organisms such as mammals and plants, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)  are repaired preferentially by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) rather than by  homologous recombination. The NHEJ pathway is mediated by Ku, a heterodimer of  approximately 70 and 80 kDa subunits, which contributes to various aspects of the  metabolism of DNA ends in eukaryotic cells. On the basis of their predicted  sequence similarity to human Ku70 and Ku80, cDNAs encoding the first plant  homologues of these proteins (AtKu70 and AtKu80, respectively) have now been  isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana. AtKu70 and AtKu80 share 28.6 and 22.5% amino  acid sequence identity with human Ku70 and Ku80, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid  analysis demonstrated that AtKu70 and AtKu80 form a heterodimer, and  electrophoretic mobility-shift assays revealed that this heterodimer binds to  double-stranded telomeric and non-telomeric DNA sequences, but not to  single-stranded DNA. The AtKu heterodimer also possesses single-stranded  DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase activities. Reverse  transcription and the polymerase chain reaction revealed that AtKu70 and AtKu80  genes are expressed widely but at low levels in plant tissues. The expression of  these two genes in cultured cells was markedly increased in response to the  generation of DSBs by bleomycin or methylmethane sulfonate. These results suggest  that the evolutionarily conserved Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer functions in DSB repair  by the NHEJ pathway in A. thaliana.', '2002 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2002.01258.x', 'Takahashi']
