Plants require an endogenous regulatory network and mechanism to cope with diurnal environmental changes and compensate for their sessile nature. Plants use the circadian clock to anticipate diurnal changes. Circadian rhythm predicts a 24-h cycle with 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness in response to abiotic and biotic factors as well as the appropriate temperature. For a plant's fitness, proper growth, and development, these rhythms synchronize the diurnal photoperiodic changes. Input pathway, central oscillator, and output pathway are the three components that make up the endogenous clock. There are also transcriptional and translational feedback loops (TTFLs) in the clock, which are dependent on the results of gene expression. Several physiological processes, such as stress acclimatization, hormone signaling, morphogenesis, carbon metabolism, and defense response, are currently being investigated for their interactions with the circadian clock using phenotypic, genomic, and metabolic studies. This review examines the role of circadian rhythms in the regulation of plant metabolic pathways, such as photosynthesis and carbon metabolism, as well as developmental and degenerative processes, such as flowering and senescence. Furthermore, we summarized signaling pathways related to circadian rhythms, such as defense response and gene regulatory pathways.
