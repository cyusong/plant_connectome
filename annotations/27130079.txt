SKIP is a conserved protein from yeasts to plants and humans. In plant cells, SKIP is a bifunctional regulator that works in the nucleus as a splicing factor by integrating into the spliceosome and as a transcriptional activator by interacting with the Paf1 complex. In this study, we identified two nuclear localization signals in SKIP and confirmed that each is sufficient to target SKIP to the nucleus. The SNW domain of SKIP is required for both its function as a splicing factor by promoting integration into the spliceosome in response to stress, and its function as a transcriptional activator by controlling its interaction with the Paf1 complex to participate in flowering. Truncated proteins that included the SNW domain and the N- or C-terminus of SKIP were still able to carry out the functions of the full-length protein in gene splicing and transcriptional activation in Arabidopsis. In addition, we found that SKIP undergoes 26S proteasome-mediated degradation, and that the C-terminus of SKIP is required to maintain the stability of the protein in plant cells. Together, our findings demonstrate the structural domain organization of SKIP and reveal the core domains and motifs underlying SKIP function in plants.
