['16098971', 'We report a time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy characterization of  photosystem I (PSI) particles prepared from Arabidopsis lines with knock-out  mutations against the peripheral antenna proteins of Lhca1 or Lhca4. The first  mutant retains Lhca2 and Lhca3 while the second retains one other  light-harvesting protein of photosystem I (Lhca) protein, probably Lhca5. The  results indicate that Lhca2/3 and Lhca1/4 each provides about equally effective  energy transfer routes to the PSI core complex, and that Lhca5 provides a less  effective energy transfer route. We suggest that the specific location of each  Lhca protein within the PSI-LHCI supercomplex is more important than the presence  of so-called red chlorophylls in the Lhca proteins.', '2005 Aug 29', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2005.06.091', 'Dekker']
