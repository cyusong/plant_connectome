Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) causes rhizomania disease in sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>), which is controlled since more than two decades by cultivars harboring the <i>Rz1</i> resistance gene. The development of resistance-breaking strains has been favored by a high selection pressure on the soil-borne virus population. Resistance-breaking is associated with mutations at amino acid positions 67-70 (tetrad) in the RNA3 encoded pathogenicity factor P25 and the presence of an additional RNA component (RNA5). However, natural BNYVV populations are highly diverse making investigations on the resistance-breaking mechanism rather difficult. Therefore, we applied a reverse genetic system for BNYVV (A type) to study <i>Rz1</i> resistance-breaking by direct agroinoculation of sugar beet seedlings. The bioassay allowed a clear discrimination between susceptible and <i>Rz1</i> resistant plants already four weeks after infection, and resistance-breaking was independent of the sugar beet <i>Rz1</i> genotype. A comprehensive screen of natural tetrads for resistance-breaking revealed several new mutations allowing BNYVV to overcome <i>Rz1</i>. The supplementation of an additional RNA5 encoding the pathogenicity factor P26 allowed virus accumulation in the <i>Rz1</i> genotype independent of the P25 tetrad. This suggests the presence of two distinct resistance-breaking mechanisms allowing BNYVV to overcome <i>Rz1</i>. Finally, we showed that the resistance-breaking effect of the tetrad and the RNA5 is specific to <i>Rz1</i> and has no effect on the stability of the second resistance gene <i>Rz2</i>. Consequently, double resistant cultivars (<i>Rz1</i>+<i>Rz2</i>) should provide effective control of <i>Rz1</i> resistance-breaking strains. Our study highlights the flexibility of the viral genome allowing BNYVV to overcome host resistance, which underlines the need for a continuous search for alternative resistance genes.
