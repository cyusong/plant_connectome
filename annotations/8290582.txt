['8290582', 'We used 5-azido-[7-3H]indole-3-acetic acid (5-azido-[7-3H]IAA), a photoaffinity  analogue of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), to search for  auxin-binding proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana membranes. We identified an  auxin-binding protein with a molecular mass of 24 kDa (Atpm24) in microsomes as  well as in plasma membrane vesicles. Atpm24 was solubilized by 1% Triton X-100  and partially purified. A cDNA clone (Atpm24.1) corresponding to Atpm24 was  isolated. The amino acid sequence predicted from the Atpm24.1 cDNA contains 212  amino acid residues with a relative molecular mass of 24,128 Da. Data base  searches revealed that the predicted protein has homology to glutathione  S-transferases (GSTs; EC 2.5.1.18). When Atpm24.1 was expressed in Escherichia  coli, we found a high level of GST activity in the bacterial extracts. We have  analyzed the substrate specificity of this protein and found that cumene  hydroperoxide and trans-stilbene oxide but not trans-cinnamic acid or IAA-CoA  were substrates. A role for this GST in physiological processes of plants is  discussed.', '1994 Jan 18', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.91.2.689', 'Palme']
