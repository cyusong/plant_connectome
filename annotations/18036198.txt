Re-activation of cell division after fertilization involves the specific regulation of a set of genes. To identify genes involved in the gametophytic to sporophytic transition, we screened Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion lines for early seed abortion at the zygote (zeus) or one-cell embryo stages (cyclops), and characterized a sporophytic zygote-lethal mutation, zeus1. ZEUS1 encodes a thymidylate kinase (AtTMPK) that synthesizes dTDP and is involved in the regulation of DNA replication. Unlike in yeast and animals, the single AtTMPK gene is capable of producing two proteins by alternative splicing; the longer isoform is targeted to the mitochondria, the shorter to the cytosol. Transcription of AtTMPK is activated during the G(1)/S-phase transition of the cell cycle, similarly to yeast and mammalian orthologues. In AtTMPK:GUS plants, the reporter gene was preferentially expressed in cells undergoing division, but was not detected during the male and female gametophytic mitoses. GUS expression was observed in mature embryo sacs prior to fertilization, and this expression may indicate the time of synchronization of the gamete cell-cycle phases. Identification of ZEU1 emphasizes the importance of control of the metabolism of DNA in the regulation of the G(1)/S-phase transition at fertilization.
