Photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in plants is limited by the inefficiency of the CO<sub>2</sub>-assimilating enzyme Rubisco. In most eukaryotic algae, Rubisco aggregates within a microcompartment known as the pyrenoid, in association with a CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism that improves photosynthetic operating efficiency under conditions of low inorganic carbon. Recent work has shown that the pyrenoid matrix is a phase-separated, liquid-like condensate. In the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, condensation is mediated by two components: Rubisco and the linker protein EPYC1 (Essential Pyrenoid Component 1). Here, we show that expression of mature EPYC1 and a plant-algal hybrid Rubisco leads to spontaneous condensation of Rubisco into a single phase-separated compartment in Arabidopsis chloroplasts, with liquid-like properties similar to a pyrenoid matrix. This work represents a significant initial step towards enhancing photosynthesis in higher plants by introducing an algal CO<sub>2</sub>-concentrating mechanism, which is predicted to significantly increase the efficiency of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake.
