Naturally occurring mutants whose phenotype recapitulates the changes that distinguish closely related species are of special interest from the evolutionary point of view. They can give a key about the genetic control of the changes that led to speciation. In this study, we described <i>lepidium-like</i> (<i>lel</i>), a naturally occurring variety of an allotetraploid species <i>Capsella bursa-pastoris</i> that is characterized by the typical loss of all four petals. In some cases, one or two basal flowers in the raceme had one or two small petals. The number and structure of other floral organs are not affected. Our study of flower development in the mutant showed that once initiated, petals either cease further development and cannot be traced in anthetic flowers or sometimes develop to various degrees. <i>lel</i> plants showed an earlier beginning of floral organ initiation and delayed petal initiation compared to the wild-type plants. <i>lel</i> phenotype has a wide geographical distribution, being found at the northern extremity of the species range as well as in the central part. The genetic analysis of inheritance demonstrated that <i>lel</i> phenotype is controlled by two independent loci. While the flower in the family Cruciferae generally has a very stable structure (i.e., four sepals, four petals, six stamens, and two carpels), several deviations from this ground plan are known, in particular in the genus <i>Lepidium</i>, <i>C. bursa-pastoris</i> is an emerging model for the study of polyploidy (which is also very widespread in Cruciferae); the identification and characterization of the apetalous mutant lays a foundation for further research of morphological evolution in polyploids.
