['9765550', 'A number of environmental stresses can lead to enhanced production of superoxide  within plant tissues, and plants are believed to rely on the enzyme superoxide  dismutase (SOD) to detoxify this reactive oxygen species. We have identified  seven cDNAs and genes for SOD in Arabidopsis. These consist of three CuZnSODs  (CSD1, CSD2, and CSD3), three FeSODs (FSD1, FSD2, and FSD3), and one MnSOD  (MSD1). The chromosomal location of these seven SOD genes has been established.  To study this enzyme family, antibodies were generated against five proteins:  CSD1, CSD2, CSD3, FSD1, and MSD1. Using these antisera and  nondenaturing-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis enzyme assays, we identified  protein and activity for two CuZnSODs and for FeSOD and MnSOD in Arabidopsis  rosette tissue. Additionally, subcellular fractionation studies revealed the  presence of CSD2 and FeSOD protein within Arabidopsis chloroplasts. The seven SOD  mRNAs and the four proteins identified were differentially regulated in response  to various light regimes, ozone fumigation, and ultraviolet-B irradiation. To our  knowledge, this is the first report of a large-scale analysis of the regulation  of multiple SOD proteins in a plant species.', '1998 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.118.2.637', 'Last']
