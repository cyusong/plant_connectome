Flower opening and closure are traits of reproductive importance in all angiosperms because they determine the success of self- and cross-pollination. The temporal nature of this phenotype rendered it a difficult target for genetic studies. Cultivated and wild lettuce, Lactuca spp., have composite inflorescences that open only once. An L. serriola×L. sativa F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population differed markedly for daily floral opening time. This population was used to map the genetic determinants of this trait; the floral opening time of 236 RILs was scored using time-course image series obtained by drone-based phenotyping on two occasions. Floral pixels were identified from the images using a support vector machine with an accuracy >99%. A Bayesian inference method was developed to extract the peak floral opening time for individual genotypes from the time-stamped image data. Two independent quantitative trait loci (QTLs; Daily Floral Opening 2.1 and qDFO8.1) explaining >30% of the phenotypic variation in floral opening time were discovered. Candidate genes with non-synonymous polymorphisms in coding sequences were identified within the QTLs. This study demonstrates the power of combining remote sensing, machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and genome-wide marker data for studying the genetics of recalcitrant phenotypes.
