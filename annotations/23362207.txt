['23362207', 'The seed maturation genes are specifically and highly expressed during late  embryogenesis. In this work, yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence  complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that HISTONE  DEACETYLASE19 (HDA19) interacted with the HIGH-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF  SUGAR-INDUCIBLE GENE2-LIKE1 (HSL1), and the zinc-finger CW [conserved Cys (C) and  Trp (W) residues] domain of HSL1 was responsible for the interaction.  Furthermore, we found that mutations in HDA19 resulted in the ectopic expression  of seed maturation genes in seedlings, which was associated with increased levels  of gene activation marks, such as Histone H3 acetylation (H3ac), Histone H4  acetylation (H4ac), and Histone H3 Lys 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3), but decreased  levels of the gene repression mark Histone H3 Lys 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3)  in the promoter and/or coding regions. In addition, elevated transcription of  certain seed maturation genes was also found in the hsl1 mutant seedlings, which  was also accompanied by the enrichment of gene activation marks but decreased  levels of the gene repression mark. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed  that HDA19 could directly bind to the chromatin of the seed maturation genes.  These results suggest that HDA19 and HSL1 may act together to repress seed  maturation gene expression during germination. Further genetic analyses revealed  that the homozygous hsl1 hda19 double mutants are embryonic lethal, suggesting  that HDA19 and HSL1 may play a vital role during embryogenesis.', '2013 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.096313', 'Huang']
