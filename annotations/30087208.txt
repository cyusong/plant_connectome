['30087208', 'Postgerminative mobilization of neutral lipids stored in seed lipid droplets  (LDs) is preceded by the degradation of oleosins, the major structural LD  proteins that stabilize LDs in dry seeds. We previously showed that Arabidopsis  thaliana oleosins are marked for degradation by ubiquitination and are extracted  from LDs before proteolysis. However, the mechanisms underlying the dislocation  of these LD-anchored proteins from the LD monolayer are yet unknown. Here, we  report that PUX10, a member of the plant UBX-domain containing (PUX) protein  family, is an integral LD protein that associates with a subpopulation of LDs  during seed germination. In pux10 mutant seedlings, PUX10 deficiency impaired the  degradation of ubiquitinated oleosins and prevented the extraction of  ubiquitinated oleosins from LDs. We also showed that PUX10 interacts with  ubiquitin and CDC48A, the AAA ATPase Cell Division Cycle 48, through its UBA and  UBX domains, respectively. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that  PUX10 is an adaptor recruiting CDC48A to ubiquitinated oleosins, thus  facilitating the dislocation of oleosins from LDs by the segregase activity of  CDC48A. We propose that PUX10 and CDC48A are core components of a LD-associated  degradation machinery, which we named the LD-associated degradation system.  Importantly, PUX10 is also the first determinant of a LD subpopulation described  in plants, suggesting functional differentiation of LDs in Arabidopsis seedlings.', '2018 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.18.00275', 'ORCID:']
