Numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of silicon (Si) for plant growth, particularly under stress conditions, and hence a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of its uptake, subsequent transport, and accumulation in different tissues is important. Here, we provide a thorough review of our current knowledge of how plants benefit from Si supplementation. The molecular mechanisms involved in Si transport are discussed and we highlight gaps in our knowledge, particularly with regards to xylem unloading and transport into heavily silicified cells. Silicification of tissues such as sclerenchyma, fibers, storage tissues, the epidermis, and vascular tissues are described. Silicon deposition in different cell types, tissues, and intercellular spaces that affect morphological and physiological properties associated with enhanced plant resilience under various biotic and abiotic stresses are addressed in detail. Most Si-derived benefits are the result of interference in physiological processes, modulation of stress responses, and biochemical interactions. A better understanding of the versatile roles of Si in plants requires more detailed knowledge of the specific mechanisms involved in its deposition in different tissues, at different developmental stages, and under different environmental conditions.
