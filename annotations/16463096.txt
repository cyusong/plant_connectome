['16463096', 'Homeodomain proteins are key regulators of patterning during the development of  animal and plant body plans. Knotted1-like TALE homeodomain proteins have been  found to play important roles in the development of the Arabidopsis shoot apical  meristem and are part of a complex regulatory network of protein interactions. We  have investigated the possible role of the knotted1-like genes KNAT1, KNAT3,  KNAT4, and KNAT5 in Arabidopsis root development. Root growth is indeterminate,  and the organ shows distinct zones of cell proliferation, elongation and  differentiation along its longitudinal axis. Here we show that KNAT1, KNAT3,  KNAT4 and KNAT5 show cell type specific expression patterns in the Arabidopsis  root. Moreover, they are expressed in different spatially restricted patterns  along the longitudinal root axis and in lateral root primordia. Hormones play an  important role in maintenance of root growth, and we have studied their effect on  KNAT gene expression. We show that KNAT3 expression is repressed by moderate  levels of cytokinin. In addition, we show that the subcellular localization of  KNAT3 and KNAT4 is regulated, indicating post-translational control of the  activities of these transcription factors. The regulated expression of KNAT1,  KNAT3, KNAT4 and KNAT5 within the Arabidopsis root suggests a role for these  genes in root development. Our data provide the first systematic survey of KNAT  gene expression in the Arabidopsis root.', '2006 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-005-1673-9', 'Haseloff']
