Ethylene is a gaseous hormone with a well-established role in the regulation of plant growth and development. However, its role in the modulation of carbon assimilation and central metabolism remains unclear. Here, we investigated the morphophysiological and biochemical responses of tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) following the application of ethylene in the form of ethephon (CEPA - 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid), forcing the classical triple response phenotype. CEPA-treated plants were characterized by growth inhibition, as revealed by significant reductions in both shoot and root dry weights, coupled with a reduced number of leaves and lower specific leaf area. Growth inhibition was associated with a reduction in carbon assimilation due to both lower photosynthesis rates and stomatal conductance, coupled with impairments in carbohydrate turnover. Furthermore, exogenous ethylene led to the accumulation of cell wall compounds (i.e., cellulose and lignin) and phenolics, indicating that exposure to exogenous ethylene also led to changes in specialized metabolism. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that exogenous ethylene disrupts plant growth and leaf structure by affecting both central and specialized metabolism, especially that involved in carbohydrate turnover and cell wall biosynthesis, ultimately leading to metabolic responses that mimic stress situations.
