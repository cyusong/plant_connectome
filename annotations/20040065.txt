Although reports on a gene for 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase (ACO1) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) suggest that high levels of its transcript are associated with internode elongation of deep-water rice during submergence, the role of ACO1 in rice development is largely unknown. The tissue-specificity of ACO1 expression indicated that its transcript significantly accumulated in lower parts of elongating internodes at the heading stage. Histochemical analysis and in situ hybridization showed that the ACO1 expression was localized in the basal parts of leaf sheaths immediately above nodes or the lower parts of elongating internodes. To further examine the role of ACO1, ACO1-deficient (aco1) and overexpressing (ACO1-OX) mutants were characterized. The total length of the elongated internodes of aco1 mutants was slightly shorter than that of wild-type plants and that of ACO1-OX mutants was longer. Interestingly, expression of the ACC synthase gene ACS1 and ethylene signalling gene OsEIN2 was up-regulated in the aco1 mutants. This study suggests that the ACO1 has a little effect on internode elongation at the heading stage, and that up-regulation of the ACS1 and OsEIN2 expression may attenuate inhibition of internode elongation.
