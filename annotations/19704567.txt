Root-knot nematodes are plant parasitic worms that establish and maintain an intimate relationship with their host plants. RKN induce the redifferentiation of root cells into multinucleate and hypertrophied giant cells essential for nematode growth and reproduction. Major rearrangements of the cytoskeleton occur during giant cell formation. We characterized the first plant candidate genes implicated in giant cell actin and microtubule cytoskeleton reorganization. We showed previously that formins may regulate giant cell isotropic growth by controlling the assembly of actin cables. Recently we demonstrated that a Microtubule-Associated Protein, MAP65-3, is essential for giant cell development. In the absence of functional MAP65-3, giant cells started to develop but failed to fully differentiate and were eventually destroyed. In developing giant cells, MAP65-3 was associated with a novel kind of cell plate-the giant cell mini cell plate-that separates daughter nuclei. Despite karyokinesis occurs without cell division in giant cell, we demonstrated that cytokinesis is initiated and required for successful pathogen growth and development.
