Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are identified in many crops for their response and role in adaptation to various abiotic stresses, such as drought, salinity, and temperature. The <i>LEA</i> genes have been studied systematically in several crops but not in <i>Vigna</i> crops. In this study, we reported the first comprehensive analysis of the <i>LEA</i> gene family in three legume species, namely, mung bean (<i>Vigna radiata</i>), adzuki bean (<i>Vigna angularis</i>), and cowpea (<i>Vigna unguiculata</i>), and the cross-species expression of <i>VrLEA</i> genes in a wild tetraploid species, <i>Vigna glabrescens</i>. A total of 201 <i>LEA</i> genes from three <i>Vigna</i> crops were identified harboring the LEA conserved motif. Among these 55, 64, and 82 <i>LEA</i> genes were identified in mung bean, adzuki bean, and cowpea genomes, respectively. These <i>LEA</i> genes were grouped into eight different classes. Our analysis revealed that the cowpea genome comprised all eight classes of <i>LEA</i> genes, whereas the LEA-6 class was absent in the mung bean genome. Similarly, LEA-5 and LEA-6 were absent in the adzuki bean genome. The analysis of <i>LEA</i> genes provides an insight into their structural and functional diversity in the <i>Vigna</i> genome. The genes, such as <i>VrLEA-2</i>, <i>VrLEA-40</i>, <i>VrLEA-47</i>, and <i>VrLEA-55</i>, were significantly upregulated in the heat-tolerant genotype under stress conditions indicating the basis of heat tolerance. The successful amplification and expression of <i>VrLEA</i> genes in <i>V. glabrescens</i> indicated the utility of the developed markers in mung bean improvement. The results of this study increase our understanding of <i>LEA</i> genes and provide robust candidate genes for future functional investigations and a basis for improving heat stress tolerance in <i>Vigna</i> crops.
