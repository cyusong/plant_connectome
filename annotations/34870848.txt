Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous oceanographic features that influence the metabolism and community structure of Synechococcus. However, the metabolic adaptations of this genus to eddy-associated environmental changes have rarely been studied. We recovered two high-quality Synechococcus metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from eddies in the South China Sea and compared their metabolic variations using metatranscriptomic samples obtained at the same time. The two MAGs (syn-bin1 and syn-bin2) are affiliated with marine Synechococcus subclusters 5.2 (S5.2) and 5.3 (S5.3), respectively. The former exhibited a higher abundance at the surface layer, whereas the latter was more abundant in the deep euphotic layer. Further analysis indicated that syn-bin1 had a strong ability to utilize organic nutrients, which could help it to thrive in the nutrient-deprived surface water. By contrast, syn-bin2 had the genetic potential to perform chromatic acclimation, which could allow it to capture green or blue light at different depths. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis showed that syn-bin2 upregulated genes involved in the synthesis of C4 acids, photosystem II proteins, and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msubsup><mtext>HCO</mtext><mn>3</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup></math> transporters in the deep euphotic layer, which might contribute to its predominance in low-light environments. Overall, this study expands our understanding of oceanic S5.2 and S5.3 Synechococcus by revealing their metabolic adaptations to mesoscale eddies.
