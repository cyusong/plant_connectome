As an oligotrophic specialist, Prochlorococcus spp. has streamlined its genome and metabolism including the CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM), which serves to elevate the CO2 concentration around Rubisco. The genomes of Prochlorococcus spp. indicate that they have a simple CCM composed of one or two HCO3(-) pumps and a carboxysome, but its functionality has not been examined. Here, we show that the CCM of Prochlorococcus spp. is effective and efficient, transporting only two molecules of HCO3(-) per molecule of CO2 fixed. A mechanistic, numerical model with a structure based on the CCM components present in the genome is able to match data on photosynthesis, CO2 efflux, and the intracellular inorganic carbon pool. The model requires the carboxysome shell to be a major barrier to CO2 efflux and shows that excess Rubisco capacity is critical to attaining a high-affinity CCM without CO2 recovery mechanisms or high-affinity HCO3(-) transporters. No differences in CCM physiology or gene expression were observed when Prochlorococcus spp. was fully acclimated to high-CO2 (1,000 µL L(-1)) or low-CO2 (150 µL L(-1)) conditions. Prochlorococcus spp. CCM components in the Global Ocean Survey metagenomes were very similar to those in the genomes of cultivated strains, indicating that the CCM in environmental populations is similar to that of cultured representatives.
