A purple acid phosphatase, GmPAP2.1, from the soybean (Glycine max) cultivar L29 may function as a resistance factor acting against specific strains of Soybean mosaic virus (SMV). In this study, we found that overexpression of GmPAP2.1 from L29 conferred SMV resistance to a susceptible cultivar, Lee 74. We determined that GmPAP2.1 interacted with the SMV protein P1 in the chloroplasts, resulting in the up-regulation of the ICS1 gene, which in turn promoted the pathogen-induced salicylic acid (SA) pathway. SA accumulation was elevated in response to the co-expression of GmPAP2.1 and SMV, while transient knockdown of endogenous SA-related genes resulted in systemic infection by SMV strain G5H, suggesting that GmPAP2.1-derived resistance depended on the SA-pathway for the activation of a defense response. Our findings thus suggest that GmPAP2.1 purple acid phosphatase of soybean cultivar L29 functions as an SA-pathway-dependent resistance factor acting against SMV.
