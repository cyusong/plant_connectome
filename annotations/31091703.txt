Zika virus (ZIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV) are mosquito-borne viruses of the <i>Flavivirus</i> genus that could cause congenital microcephaly and hemorrhage, respectively, in humans, and thus present a risk to global public health. A preventive vaccine against ZIKV remains unavailable, and no specific antiviral drugs against ZIKV and DENV are licensed. Medicinal plants may be a source of natural antiviral drugs which mostly target viral entry. In this study, we evaluate the antiviral activity of <i>Doratoxylum apetalum</i>, an indigenous medicinal plant from the Mascarene Islands, against ZIKV and DENV infection. Our data indicated that <i>D. apetalum</i> exhibited potent antiviral activity against a contemporary epidemic strain of ZIKV and clinical isolates of four DENV serotypes at non-cytotoxic concentrations in human cells. Time-of-drug-addition assays revealed that <i>D. apetalum</i> extract acts on ZIKV entry by preventing the internalisation of virus particles into the host cells. Our data suggest that <i>D. apetalum</i>-mediated ZIKV inhibition relates to virus particle inactivation. We suggest that <i>D. apetalum</i> could be a promising natural source for the development of potential antivirals against medically important flaviviruses.
