Fertilization of woody plants plays a central role in agriculture and forestry, but little is known about how plant water relations are thereby affected. Here we investigated the impact of fertilization on tree hydraulics, and xylem and pit anatomy in the high-yield apple cultivars Golden and Red Delicious. In fertilized trees of Golden Delicious, specific hydraulic conductivity of branch xylem, hydraulic conductance of the root system, and maximum stomatal conductance increased considerably. In Red Delicious, differences between fertilized and control trees were less pronounced. In both cultivars, xylem embolism resistance of fertilized trees was significantly lower and stomatal closure occurred at lower water potentials. Furthermore, water potential at turgor loss point and osmotic potential at full saturation were higher and cell wall elasticity was lower in fertilized plants, suggesting reduced drought tolerance of leaves. Anatomical differences were observed regarding conduit diameters, cell wall reinforcement, pit membrane thickness, pit chamber depth, and stomatal pore length, with more pronounced differences in Golden Delicious. The findings reveal altered hydraulic behaviour in both apple cultivars upon fertilization. The increased vulnerability to hydraulic failure might pose a considerable risk for apple productivity under a changing climate, which should be considered for future cultivation and management practices.
