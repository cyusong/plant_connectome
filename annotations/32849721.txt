<i>Aegilops tauschii</i> Coss is one of the most hazardous weeds that severely infests wheat fields in China. The tillering ability of <i>Ae. tauschii</i> strongly affects the occurrence and spread by influencing its seed output. In this study, <i>Ae. tauschii</i> was sown at low plant density (LPD) and high plant density (HPD) to investigate the effect of plant density on tiller bud outgrowth and its potential regulators using RNA-Seq. Additionally, the chlorophyll content and photosynthesis, soluble sugar and phytohormone levels were also determined at different plant densities. The results showed that an increased plant density significantly inhibited the elongation of tiller buds in the axil of the first leaf at 15 days after planting, with 7.69 mm at LPD and 1.69 mm at HPD. A total of seven putative tiller-related genes were selected and validated using quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, chlorophyll levels, photosynthetic efficiency, and soluble sugar contents were distinctly inhibited by HPD in <i>Ae. tauschii</i>, which may be responsible for the restriction of tiller bud growth. In addition, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were markedly enriched in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellin metabolism and signaling. Accordingly, the levels of ABA and gibberellin A3 in <i>Ae. tauschii</i> were strikingly higher at HPD compared with those at LPD, yet the reverse tendency was observed for IAA. Undoubtedly, such results will be highly beneficial for illuminating the underlying regulators of the <i>Ae. tauschii</i> tillering response to plant density and may provide new ideas for the control of this weed in the future.
