Grapevine trunk diseases have devastating consequences on vineyards worldwide. European wild grapevines (Vitis vinifera subs. sylvestris) from the last viable population in Germany along the Rhine river showed variable degrees of resistance against Neofusicoccum parvum (strain Bt-67), a fungus associated with Botryosphaeriaceae-related dieback. Representative genotypes from different subclades of this population were mapped with respect to their ability to induce wood necrosis, as well as their defence responses in a controlled inoculation system. The difference in colonization patterns could be confirmed by cryo-scanning electron microscopy, while there was no relationship between vessel diameter and infection success. Resistant lines accumulated more stilbenes, that were in addition significantly partitioned to nonglycosylated viniferin trimers. By contrast, the susceptible genotypes accumulated less stilbenes with a significantly higher proportion of glycosylated piceid. We suggest a model in which in the resistant genotypes phenylpropanoid metabolism is channelled rapidly and specifically to the bioactive stilbenes. Our study specifies a resistant chemotype against grapevines trunk diseases and paves a way to breed for resistance against grapevine Botryosphaeriaceae-related dieback.
