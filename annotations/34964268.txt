Target of rapamycin (TOR) is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase that functions as a central signaling hub to integrate diverse internal and external cues to precisely orchestrate cellular and organismal physiology. During evolution, TOR both maintains the highly conserved TOR complex compositions, and cellular and molecular functions, but also evolves distinctive roles and strategies to modulate cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, survival, and stress responses in eukaryotes. Here, we review recent discoveries on the plant TOR signaling network. We present an overview of plant TOR complexes, analyze the signaling landscape of the plant TOR signaling network from the upstream signals that regulate plant TOR activation to the downstream effectors involved in various biological processes, and compare their conservation and specificities within different biological contexts. Finally, we summarize the impact of dysregulation of TOR signaling on every stage of plant growth and development, from embryogenesis and seedling growth, to flowering and senescence.
