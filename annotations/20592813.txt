The developmental response of the Arabidopsis root system to low phosphorus (P) availability involves the reduction in primary root elongation accompanied by the formation of numerous lateral roots. We studied the roles of selected redox metabolites, namely, radical oxygen species (ROS) and ascorbic acid (ASC) in the regulation of root system architecture by different P availability. Rapidly growing roots of plants grown on P-sufficient medium synthesize ROS in root elongation zone and quiescent centre. We have demonstrated that the arrest of root elongation at low P medium coincides with the disappearance of ROS from the elongation zone. P-starvation resulted in a decrease in ascorbic acid level in roots. This correlated with a decrease in cell division activity. On the other hand, feeding P-deficient plants with ASC, stimulated mitotic activity in the primary root meristem and partly reversed the inhibition of root growth imposed by low P conditions. In this paper, we discuss the idea of the involvement of redox agents in the regulation of root system architecture under low P availability.
