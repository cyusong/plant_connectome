Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key signaling molecule that mediates plant response to stress. Increasing evidence indicates that ABA also regulates many aspects of plant development, such as seed germination, leaf development, and ripening. ABA metabolism, including ABA biosynthesis and degradation, is an essential aspect of ABA response in plants. In this study, we identified four cytochrome P450 genes (<i>CaCYP707A1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>3</i>, and <i>4</i>) that mediate ABA hydroxylation, which is required for ABA degradation in <i>Capsicum annuum</i>. We observed that CaCYP707A-mediated ABA hydroxylation promotes ABA degradation, leading to low levels of ABA and a dehydration phenotype in <i>35S:CaCYP707A</i> plants. Importantly, seed formation was strongly inhibited in <i>35S:CaCYP707A</i> plants, and a cross-pollination test suggested that the defect in seed formation is caused by improper pollen development. Phenotypic analysis showed that pollen maturation is suppressed in <i>35S:CaCYP707A1</i> plants. Consequently, most <i>35S:CaCYP707A1</i> pollen grains degenerated, unlike non-transgenic (NT) pollen, which developed into mature pollen grains. Together our results indicate that CaCYP707A mediates ABA hydroxylation and thereby influences pollen development, helping to elucidate the mechanism underlying ABA-regulated pollen development.
