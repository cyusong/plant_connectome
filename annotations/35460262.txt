Photosynthetic organisms adapt to a variety of light conditions. Codium fragile, a macrosiphonous green alga, binds a unique carbonyl carotenoid, siphonaxanthin, to its major photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, allowing it to utilize dim blue-green light for photosynthesis. Here, we describe the absolute chemical structure of a novel siphonaxanthin biosynthetic precursor, 19-deoxysiphonaxanthin, that accumulates specifically in the photosynthetic antenna only when cultivated under blue-green light. The action spectra of pigment accumulation suggest that siphonaxanthin biosynthesis is regulated by a specific wavelength profile. The results provide clues to a new acclimation mechanism to withstand hours of intense light at low tide and why siphonous algae have been growing invasively on the world's coasts for more than a century.
