['19589071', 'Some receptor-like kinases (RLK) control plant development while others regulate  immunity. The Arabidopsis ERECTA (ER) RLK regulates both biological processes. To  discover specific components of ER-mediated immunity, a genetic screen was  conducted to identify suppressors of erecta (ser) susceptibility to  Plectosphaerella cucumerina fungus. The ser1 and ser2 mutations restored disease  resistance to this pathogen to wild-type levels in the er-1 background but failed  to suppress er-associated developmental phenotypes. The deposition of callose  upon P. cucumerina inoculation, which was impaired in the er-1 plants, was also  restored to near wild-type levels in the ser er-1 mutants. Analyses of er cell  walls revealed that total neutral sugars were reduced and uronic acids increased  relative to those of wild-type walls. Interestingly, in the ser er-1 walls,  neutral sugars were elevated and uronic acids were reduced relative to both er-1  and wild-type plants. The cell-wall changes found in er-1 and the ser er-1  mutants are unlikely to contribute to their developmental alterations. However,  they may influence disease resistance, as a positive correlation was found  between uronic acids content and resistance to P. cucumerina. We propose a  specific function for ER in regulating cell wall-mediated disease resistance that  is distinct from its role in development.', '2009 Aug', 'Mol Plant Microbe Interact', '10.1094/MPMI-22-8-0953', 'Molina']
