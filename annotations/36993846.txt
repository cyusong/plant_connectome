In the Tibetan Plateau grassland ecosystems, nitrogen (N) availability is rising dramatically; however, the influence of higher N on the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) might impact on plant competitive interactions. Therefore, understanding the part played by AMF in the competition between <i>Vicia faba</i> and <i>Brassica napus</i> and its dependence on the N-addition status is necessary. To address this, a glasshouse experiment was conducted to examine whether the grassland AMF community's inocula (AMF and NAMF) and N-addition levels (N-0 and N-15) alter plant competition between <i>V. faba</i> and <i>B. napus</i>. Two harvests took day 45 (1<sup>st</sup> harvest) and day 90 (2<sup>nd</sup> harvest), respectively. The findings showed that compared to <i>B. napus</i>, AMF inoculation significantly improved the competitive potential of the <i>V. faba</i>. In the occurrence of AMF, <i>V. faba</i> was the strongest competitor being facilitated by <i>B. napus</i> in both harvests. While under N-15, AMF significantly enhanced tissue N:P ratio in <i>B. napus</i> mixed-culture at 1<sup>st</sup> harvest, the opposite trend was observed in 2<sup>nd</sup> harvest. The mycorrhizal growth dependency slightly negatively affected mixed-culture compared to monoculture under both N-addition treatments. The aggressivity index of AMF plants was higher than NAMF plants with both N-addition and harvests. Our observation highlights that mycorrhizal associations might facilitate host plant species in mixed-culture with non-host plant species. Additionally, interacting with N-addition, AMF could impact the competitive ability of the host plant not only directly but also indirectly, thereby changing the growth and nutrient uptake of competing plant species.
