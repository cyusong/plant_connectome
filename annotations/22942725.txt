Abiotic stresses such as extremes of temperature and pH, high salinity and drought, comprise some of the major factors causing extensive losses to crop production worldwide. Understanding how plants respond and adapt at cellular and molecular levels to continuous environmental changes is a pre-requisite for the generation of resistant or tolerant plants to abiotic stresses. In this review we aimed to present the recent advances on mechanisms of downstream plant responses to abiotic stresses and the use of stress-related genes in the development of genetically engineered crops.

Abiotic stress: !affects! Crop production
Plants: !respond to! Environmental changes
Downstream plant responses: !regulated by! Stress-related genes
Genetically engineered crops: !developed using! Stress-related genes
