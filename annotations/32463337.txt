Membrane lipids change drastically in plants when they suffered from hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) stress. Overall, hypoxia stress lowers the contents of total lipids, inhabits lipid biosynthesis, and stimulates lipid degradation, leading to the accumulation of free fatty acids. Lipid alterations include changes in the contents of lipid classes, the extent of saturation, and the length of acyl chains. But the detail and systematic studies about lipid changes, as well as the function mechanism in hypoxia stress are poorly understood. Here, the major unanswered questions and suggestions on the study of the function of lipid in hypoxia stress were provided.

Hypoxia Stress: !lowers! Total Lipids 
Hypoxia Stress: !inhibits! Lipid Biosynthesis 
Hypoxia Stress: !stimulates! Lipid Degradation 
Lipid Alterations: !include changes in! Contents of Lipid Classes 
Lipid Alterations: !include changes in! Extent of Saturation 
Lipid Alterations: !include changes in! Length of Acyl Chains
