['36036886', 'Seed dormancy is an adaptive trait that enables plants to survive adverse  conditions and restart growth in a season and location suitable for vegetative  and reproductive growth. Control of seed dormancy is also important for crop  production and food quality because it can help induce uniform germination and  prevent preharvest sprouting. Rice preharvest sprouting quantitative trait locus  analysis has identified Seed dormancy 4 (Sdr4) as a positive regulator of  dormancy development. Here, we analyzed the loss-of-function mutant of the  Arabidopsis ortholog, Sdr4 Like1 (SFL1), and found that the sfl1-1 seeds showed  precocious germination at the mid- to late-maturation stage similar to rice sdr4  mutant, but converted to become more dormant than the wild type during maturation  drying. Coordinated with the dormancy levels, expression levels of the seed  maturation and dormancy master regulator genes, ABI3, FUS3, and DOG1 in sfl1-1  seeds were lower than in wild type at early- and mid-maturation stages, but  higher at the late-maturation stage. In addition to the seed dormancy phenotype,  sfl1-1 seedlings showed a growth arrest phenotype and heterochronic expression of  LAFL (LEC1, ABI3, FUS3, LEC2) and DOG1 in the seedlings. These data suggest that  SFL1 is a positive regulator of initiation and termination of the seed dormancy  program. We also found genetic interaction between SFL1 and the SFL2, SFL3, and  SFL4 paralogs of SFL1, which impacts on the timing of the phase transition from  embryo maturation to seedling growth.', '2022 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.15959', 'ORCID:']
