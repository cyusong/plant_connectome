Salt stress is one of the most devastating environmental factors threatening soybean growth and yield. However, the molecular link between salt stress and epigenetics has not been well-elucidated in soybean. In this study, from the wild soybean cDNA library, we isolated a GsSnRK1 kinase interacting protein (GsMSTY1) which is phylogenetically homologous with histone acetyltransferase MYST family with unknown function. <i>GsMSTY1</i> gene is dominantly expressed in wild soybean roots and is highly responsive to abiotic stresses. GsMYST1 was able to be phosphorylated at the Ser44 site by GsSnRK1 and demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> acetyltransferase activity in transgenic soybean roots revealed by an anti-H4ace antibody. A transcription factor protein GsNAC83 was identified to interact with both GsMYST1 and GsSnRK1, and GsNAC83 could recruit the GsMYST1-GsSnRK1 module to <i>COR15B</i> gene promoter determined by ChIP-qPCR assay. To dissect the molecular functions of this ternary complex, we treated the transgenic soybean roots with salt stress and found that the stress could activate GsSnRK1, and the activated GsSnRK1 subsequently phosphorylated GsMYST1 to enhance its acetyltransferase activity which may epigenetically promote the target gene expression. To explore the physiological functions, we coexpressed <i>GsSnRK1</i> and <i>GsMYST1</i> genes in soybean hairy roots and found that only <i>GsSnRK1</i>(wt)/<i>GsMYST1</i>(wt) but not the mutant genes could promote soybean resistance to salt stress, implicating that phosphorylation of GsMYST1 is required for it to acetylate histone H4 on the target genes to upregulate expression of the stress-related genes. Our data shed new light on the functions of the GsSnRK1-GsMYST1-GsNAC83 module and its regulatory mechanism on plant tolerance to abiotic stresses.
