Two salt hypersensitive mutants she1 and she2 were identified through genetic screening. SHE1 encodes a cellulose synthase CESA6 while SHE2 encodes a cellulose synthase-interactive protein CSI1. Both of them are involved in cellulose deposition. Our results demonstrated that the sustained cellulose synthesis is important for salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.

she1: !encodes! cellulose synthase CESA6
she2: !encodes! cellulose synthase-interactive protein CSI1
she1/she2: !involved in! cellulose deposition
cellulose synthesis: !important for! salt stress tolerance
