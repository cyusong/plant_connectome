['23250625', "Small Auxin Up RNA genes (SAURs) are early auxin-responsive genes, but whether  any of them are involved in leaf senescence is not known. Auxin, on the other  hand, has been shown to have a role in leaf senescence. Some of the external  application experiments indicated that auxin can inhibit leaf senescence, whereas  other experiments indicated that auxin can promote leaf senescence. Here, we  report the identification and characterization of an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) leaf senescence-associated gene named SAG201, which is highly  up-regulated during leaf senescence and can be induced by 1-naphthaleneacetic  acid, a synthetic auxin. It encodes a functionally uncharacterized SAUR that has  been annotated as SAUR36. Leaf senescence in transfer DNA insertion saur36  knockout lines was delayed as revealed by analyses of chlorophyll content,  F(v)/F(m) ratio (a parameter for photosystem II activity), ion leakage, and the  expression of leaf senescence marker genes. In contrast, transgenic Arabidopsis  plants overexpressing SAUR36 (without its 3' untranslated region [UTR]) displayed  an early leaf senescence phenotype. However, plants overexpressing SAUR36 with  its 3' UTR were normal and did not exhibit the early-senescence phenotype. These  data suggest that SAUR36 is a positive regulator of leaf senescence and may  mediate auxin-induced leaf senescence and that the 3' UTR containing a highly  conserved downstream destabilizes the SAUR36 transcripts in young leaves.", '2013 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.112.212787', 'Gan']
