In Trifolium repens the rate of outgrowth of an axillary bud was closely correlated with its duration of exposure to a nearby nodal root. The dose-dependent nature of this relationship, over 0-22 d, is consistent with the concept that axillary buds are cumulatively activated by a root signal (RS) such that the longer they receive the signal the higher is their level of activation and hence their rate of outgrowth. Furthermore, the activation level attained by a bud was subsequently retained following the excision of the nodal root providing the source of its activation: its rate of growth 3-6 weeks after root excision still reflected the initial level of activation of the bud. Thus, once activated, a bud required relatively little RS to maintain its rate of outgrowth, implying that activation involves the establishment of an autonomous control mechanism within the bud itself. This provides an explanation of how a strongly activated apical bud can continue growth at relatively low RS levels when it is distanced from its nearest root system, while at the same time the prevailing low RS environment leads to weak activation of the axillary buds emerging from it.

Root signal: !activates! Axillary bud
Axillary bud: !maintains! Activation level
Root signal: !leads to! Weak activation
