['7919990', 'Leaf plastids of the Arabidopsis pale cress (pac) mutant do not develop beyond  the initial stages of differentiation from proplastids or etioplasts and contain  only low levels of chlorophylls and carotenoids. Early in development, the  epidermis and mesophyll of pac leaves resemble those of wild-type plants. In  later stages, mutant leaves have enlarged intercellular spaces, and the palisade  layer of the mesophyll can no longer be distinguished. To study the molecular  basis of this phenotype, we cloned PAC and determined that this gene is regulated  by light and has the capacity to encode an acidic, predominantly alpha-helical  protein. The PAC gene appears to be a novel component of a light-induced  regulatory network that controls the development of leaves and chloroplasts.', '1994 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.6.9.1253', 'Scolnik']
