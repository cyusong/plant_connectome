Natural products used for their health-promoting properties have accompanied the evolution of humanity. Nowadays, as an effort to scientifically validate the health-promoting effects described by traditional medicine, an ever-growing number of bioactivities are being described for natural products and the phytochemicals that constitute them. Among them, medicinal plants and more specifically the <i>Thymus</i> genus spp., arise as products already present in the diet and with high acceptance, that are a source of phytochemicals with high pharmacological value. Phenolic acids, flavonoid glycoside derivatives, and terpenoids from <i>Thymus</i> spp. have been described for their ability to modulate cell death and survival pathways, much-valued bioactivities in the pharmaceutical industry, that continually sought-after new formulations to prevent undesired cell death or to control cell proliferation. Among these, wound treatment, protection from endogenous/exogenous toxic molecules, or the induction of selective cell death, such as the search for new anti-tumoral agents, arise as main objectives. This review summarizes and discusses studies on <i>Thymus</i> spp., as well as on compounds present in their extracts, with regard to their health-promoting effects involving the modulation of cell death or survival signaling pathways. In addition, studies regarding the main bioactive molecules and their cellular molecular targets were also reviewed. Concerning cell survival and proliferation, <i>Thymus</i> spp. present themselves as an option for new formulations designed for wound healing and protection against chemicals-induced toxicity. However, <i>Thymus</i> spp. extracts and some of their compounds regulate cell death, presenting anti-tumoral activity. Therefore <i>Thymus</i> spp. is a rich source of compounds with nutraceutical and pharmaceutical value.
