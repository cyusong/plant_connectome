Translocator proteins (TSPO) are conserved membrane proteins extensively studied in mammals, but their function is still unclear. Angiosperm TSPO are transiently induced by abiotic stresses in vegetative tissues. We showed previously that constitutive expression of the Arabidopsis TSPO (AtTSPO) could be detrimental to the cell. Degradation of AtTSPO requires an active autophagy pathway. We show here that genetic modifications of TSPO expression in plant and yeast cells reduce the levels of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LD). Transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing AtTSPO contain less LD as compared with wild type (WT). LD levels were increased in Arabidopsis AtTSPO knockout (KO) seedlings. Deletion of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe TSPO resulted in an increase in LD level in the cell. As compared with the WT, the mutant strain was more sensitive to cerulenin, an inhibitor of fatty acids and sterol biosynthesis. We found that in contrast with seedlings, overexpression of AtTSPO (OE) resulted in an up to 50% increase in seeds fatty acids as compared with WT. A time course experiment revealed that after 4 days of seed imbibition, the levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) was still higher in the OE seeds as compared with WT or KO seeds. However, the de novo synthesis of phospholipids and TAG after 24 h of imbibition was substantially reduced in OE seeds as compared with WT or KO seeds. Our findings support a plant TSPO role in energy homeostasis in a tissue-specific manner, enhancing fatty acids and LD accumulation in mature seeds and limiting LD levels in seedlings.
