Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth. The roots are the main organ for nutrient and water absorption in plants, and they adapt to low-P soils by altering their architecture for enhancing absorption of inorganic phosphate (Pi). This review summarizes the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental responses of roots to Pi starvation, including the primary root, lateral root, root hair, and root growth angle, in the dicot model plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and the monocot model plant rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The importance of different root traits and genes for breeding P-efficient roots in rice varieties for Pi-deficient soils are also discussed, which we hope will benefit the genetic improvement of Pi uptake, Pi-use efficiency, and crop yields.
