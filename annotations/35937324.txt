The impact of global warming on transpiration and photosynthesis would compromise plant fitness, impacting on crop yields and ecosystem functioning. In this frame, we explored the performance of a set of Arabidopsis mutants carrying partial or total loss-of-function alleles of stomatal development genes and displaying distinct stomatal abundances. Using microscopy and non-invasive imaging techniques on this genotype collection, we examined anatomical leaf and stomatal traits, plant growth and development, and physiological performance at optimal (22°C) and supra-optimal (30°C) temperatures. All genotypes showed thermomorphogenetic responses but no signs of heat stress. Data analysis singled out an extremely low stomatal abundance mutant, <i>spch-5</i>. At 22°C, <i>spch-5</i> had lower transpiration and warmer leaves than the wild type. However, at 30°C, this mutant developed larger stomata and thinner leaves, paralleled by a notable cooling capacity, similar to that of the wild type. Despite their low stomatal density (SD), <i>spch-5</i> plants grown at 30°C showed no photosynthesis or growth penalties. The behavior of <i>spch-5</i> at supra-optimal temperature exemplifies how the effect of very low stomatal numbers can be counteracted by a combination of larger stomata and thinner leaves. Furthermore, it provides a novel strategy for coping with high growth temperatures.
