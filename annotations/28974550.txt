['28974550', 'Plant cell separation and expansion require pectin degradation by endogenous  pectinases such as polygalacturonases, few of which have been functionally  characterized. Stomata are a unique system to study both processes because  stomatal maturation involves limited separation between sister guard cells and  stomatal responses require reversible guard cell elongation and contraction.  However, the molecular mechanisms for how stomatal pores form and how guard cell  walls facilitate dynamic stomatal responses remain poorly understood. We  characterized POLYGALACTURONASE INVOLVED IN EXPANSION3 (PGX3), which is expressed  in expanding tissues and guard cells. PGX3-GFP localizes to the cell wall and is  enriched at sites of stomatal pore initiation in cotyledons. In seedlings,  ablating or overexpressing PGX3 affects both cotyledon shape and the spacing and  pore dimensions of developing stomata. In adult plants, PGX3 affects rosette  size. Although stomata in true leaves display normal density and morphology when  PGX3 expression is altered, loss of PGX3 prevents smooth stomatal closure, and  overexpression of PGX3 accelerates stomatal opening. These phenotypes correspond  with changes in pectin molecular mass and abundance that can affect wall  mechanics. Together, these results demonstrate that PGX3-mediated pectin  degradation affects stomatal development in cotyledons, promotes rosette  expansion, and modulates guard cell mechanics in adult plants.', '2017 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.17.00568', 'ORCID:']
