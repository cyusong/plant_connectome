<i>Lycium</i> species (goji), belonging to Solanaceae, are widely spread in the arid to semiarid environments of Eurasia, Africa, North and South America, among which most species have affinal drug and diet functions, resulting in their potential to be a superior healthy food. However, compared with other crop species, scientific research on breeding <i>Lycium</i> species lags behind. This review systematically introduces the present germplasm resources, cytological examination and molecular-assisted breeding progress in <i>Lycium</i> species. Introduction of the distribution of <i>Lycium</i> species around the world could facilitate germplasm collection for breeding. Karyotypes of different species could provide a feasibility analysis of fertility between species. The introduction of mapping technology has discussed strategies for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in <i>Lycium</i> species according to different kinds of traits. Moreover, to extend the number of traits and standardize the protocols of trait detection, we also provide 1,145 potential traits (275 agronomic and 870 metabolic) in different organs based on different reference studies on <i>Lycium</i>, tomato and other Solanaceae species. Finally, perspectives on goji breeding research are discussed and concluded. This review will provide breeders with new insights into breeding <i>Lycium</i> species.
