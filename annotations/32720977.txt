Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major abiotic stress that restricts crop production in acid soils. Plants have evolved internal and external mechanisms of tolerance, and among them it is well known that AtSTOP1 and OsART1 are key transcription factors involved in tolerance through regulation of multiple downstream genes. Here, we identified the closest homolog of these two proteins in barley, namely HvATF1, Al-tolerance Transcription Factor 1, and determined its potential function in Al stress. HvATF1 is expressed in the nucleus, and functions in transcriptional activation. The transcription of HvATF1 was found to be constitutive in different tissues, and was little affected by Al stress. Knockdown of HvATF1 by RNAi resulted in increased Al sensitivity. Transcriptomics analysis identified 64 differently expressed genes in the RNAi lines compared to the wild-type, and these were considered as candidate downstream genes regulated by HvATF1. This study provides insights into the different molecular mechanisms of Al tolerance in barley and other plants.
