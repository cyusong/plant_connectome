In plants, the extracellular space (apoplast) is one of the main places where exchange of molecules occurs between cells. Not only is this compartment involved in the storage of multiple metabolites and ions, including calcium and protons, but it also plays a role in the transmission of signaling molecules for cell-to-cell communication. It has recently been shown multiple times that these two aspects are linked and can influence each other. In particular, apoplast pH was shown as a primary regulator of auxin (IAA) transport in Arabidopsis thaliana. To prove the role of apoplastic pH, we have developed a protocol for apoplastic fluid extraction from Arabidopsis leaves, followed by pH determination using the 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (HPTS) fluorescent dye. This technique successfully allows one to monitor apoplastic pH variations among different plant lines and to link changes in apoplastic pH to cellular responses in the plant.
