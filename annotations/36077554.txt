Plants frequently experience hypoxia due to flooding caused by intensive rainfall or irrigation, when they are partially or completely submerged under a layer of water. In the latter case, some resistant plants implement a hypoxia avoidance strategy by accelerating shoot elongation, which allows lifting their leaves above the water surface. This strategy is achieved due to increased water uptake by shoot cells through water channels (aquaporins, AQPs). It remains a puzzle how an increased flow of water through aquaporins into the cells of submerged shoots can be achieved, while it is well known that hypoxia inhibits the activity of aquaporins. In this review, we summarize the literature data on the mechanisms that are likely to compensate for the decline in aquaporin activity under hypoxic conditions, providing increased water entry into cells and accelerated shoot elongation. These mechanisms include changes in the expression of genes encoding aquaporins, as well as processes that occur at the post-transcriptional level. We also discuss the involvement of hormones, whose concentration changes in submerged plants, in the control of aquaporin activity.
