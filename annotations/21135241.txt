['21135241', 'Stems of dicotyledonous plants consist of an outer epidermis, a cortex, a ring of  secondarily thickened vascular bundles and interfascicular cells, and inner pith  parenchyma cells with thin primary walls. It is unclear how the different cell  layers attain and retain their identities. Here, we show that WRKY transcription  factors are in part responsible for the parenchymatous nature of the pith cells  in dicotyledonous plants. We isolated mutants of Medicago truncatula and  Arabidopsis thaliana with secondary cell wall thickening in pith cells associated  with ectopic deposition of lignin, xylan, and cellulose, leading to an  approximately 50%  increase in biomass density in stem tissue of the Arabidopsis mutants. The  mutations are caused by disruption of stem-expressed WRKY transcription factor  (TF) genes, which consequently up-regulate downstream genes encoding the NAM,  ATAF1/2, and CUC2 (NAC) and CCCH type (C3H) zinc finger TFs that activate  secondary wall synthesis. Direct binding of WRKY to the NAC gene promoter and  repression of three downstream TFs were confirmed by in vitro assays and in  planta transgenic experiments. Secondary wall-bearing cells form lignocellulosic  biomass that is the source for second generation biofuel production. The  discovery of negative regulators of secondary wall formation in pith opens up the  possibility of significantly increasing the mass of fermentable cell wall  components in bioenergy crops.', '2010 Dec 21', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1016436107', 'Dixon']
