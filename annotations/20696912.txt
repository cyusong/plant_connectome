The hypersensitive response (HR), characterized by a rapid and localized cell death at the inoculation site, is one of the most efficient resistance reactions to pathogen attack in plants. The transcription factor AtMYB30 was identified as a positive regulator of the HR and resistance responses during interactions between Arabidopsis and bacteria. Here, we show that AtMYB30 and the secreted phospholipase AtsPLA(2)-alpha physically interact in vivo, following the AtMYB30-mediated specific relocalization of AtsPLA(2)-alpha from cytoplasmic vesicles to the plant cell nucleus. This protein interaction leads to repression of AtMYB30 transcriptional activity and negative regulation of plant HR. Moreover, Atspla(2)-alpha mutant plants are more resistant to bacterial inoculation, whereas AtsPLA(2)-alpha overexpression leads to decreased resistance, confirming that AtsPLA(2)-alpha is a negative regulator of AtMYB30-mediated defense. These data underline the importance of cellular dynamics and, particularly, protein translocation to the nucleus, for defense-associated gene regulation in plants.
