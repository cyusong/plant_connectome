['9565033', 'Phototropism-bending towards the light-is one of the best known plant tropic  responses. Despite being reported by Darwin and others over a century ago to be  specifically under the control of blue light, the photoreceptors mediating  phototropism have remained unknown. We have characterized a blue-light  photoreceptor from Arabidopsis, named CRY1 for cryptochrome 1; this photoreceptor  is a flavoprotein that mediates numerous blue-light-dependent responses. In  Arabidopsis, HY4 (the gene encoding CRY1) is a member of a small gene family that  also encodes a related photoreceptor, CRY2, which shares considerable functional  overlap with CRY1. Here we report that mutant plants lacking both the CRY1 and  the CRY2 blue-light photoreceptors are deficient in the phototropic response.  Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing CRY1 or CRY2 show enhanced  phototropic curvature. We conclude that cryptochrome is one of the photoreceptors  mediating phototropism in plants.', '1998 Apr 16', 'Nature', '10.1038/33701', 'Cashmore']
