<i>Brassica oleracea</i> is an important species due to its high economic and nutritional value. Moreover, it is an ideal model for studies of morphology and genome evolution. In the genomic era, with massive "omics" data being generated, a high-efficiency platform is crucial to deepen our understanding of this important species. In this study, we developed the <i>B. oleracea</i> Genome Database (BoGDB) to consolidate genome, transcriptome, and metabolome data of <i>B. oleracea</i> cultivars, providing the first cross-omics platform for <i>B. oleracea</i>. In order to make full use of the multi-omics data, BoGDB integrates multiple functional modules, including "Gene Search," "Heatmap," "Genome Browser," "Genome," "Tools," "Metabolic," and "Variation," which provides a user-friendly platform for genomic and genetic research and molecular design breeding of <i>B. oleracea</i> crops. In addition, BoGDB will continue to collect new genomic data of <i>B. oleracea</i> and integrate them into BoGDB when higher-quality genomic data are released.
