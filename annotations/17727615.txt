['17727615', 'ABCG11/WBC11, an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter from Arabidopsis  thaliana, is a key component of the export pathway for cuticular lipids.  Arabidopsis wbc11 T-DNA insertional knock-out mutants exhibited lipidic  inclusions inside epidermal cells similar to the previously characterized wax  transporter mutant cer5, with a similar strong reduction in the alkanes of  surface waxes. Moreover, the wbc11 knock-out mutants also showed defects not  present in cer5, including post-genital organ fusions, stunted growth and a  reduction in cutin load on the plant surface. A mutant line previously isolated  in a forward genetics screen, called permeable leaves 1 (pel1), was identified as  an allele of ABCG11/WBC11. The double knock-out wbc11 cer5 exhibited the same  morphological and biochemical phenotypes as the wbc11 knock-out. A YFP-WBC11  fusion protein rescued a T-DNA knock-out mutant and was localized to the plasma  membrane. These results show that WBC11 functions in secretion of surface waxes,  possibly by interacting with CER5. However, unlike ABCG12/CER5, ABCG11/WBC11 is  important to the normal process of cutin formation.', '2007 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03252.x', 'Samuels']
