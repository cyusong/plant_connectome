['10093894', 'Although endoreduplication is common in plants, little is known about the  mechanisms regulating this process. Here, we report the patterns of  endoreduplication at the cellular level in the shoot apex of Arabidopsis thaliana  L. Heynh. plants grown under short-day conditions. We show that polyploidy is  developmentally established in the pith, maturing leaves, and stipules. To  investigate the role of the cell cycle genes CDC2aAt, CDC2bAt, CYCB1;1, and  CKS1At in the process of endoreduplication, in-situ hybridizations were performed  on the vegetative shoot apices. Expression of CDC2aAt, CDC2bAt, and CYCB1;1 was  restricted to mitotically dividing cells. In contrast, CKS1At expression was  present in both mitotic and endoreduplicating tissues. Our data indicate that  CDC2aAt, CDC2bAt, and CYCB1;1 only operate during mitotic divisions, whereas  CKS1At may play a role in both the mitotic and endoreduplication cycle.', '1999 Feb', 'Planta', '10.1007/s004250050509', 'Inze']
