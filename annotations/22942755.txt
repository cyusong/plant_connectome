Plants are constantly exposed to microbes, for this reason they have evolved sophisticated strategies to perceive and identify biotic interactions. Thus, plants have large collections of so-called resistance (R) proteins that recognize specific microbe factors as signals of invasion. One of these proteins is codified by the Arabidopsis thaliana HR4 gene in the Col-0 ecotype that is homologous to RPW8 genes present in the Ms-0 ecotype. In this study, we investigated the expression patterns of the HR4 gene in Arabidopsis seedlings interacting with the beneficial fungus Trichoderma atroviride. We observed the induction of the HR4 gene mainly at 96 hpi when the fungus interaction was established. Furthermore, we found that the HR4 gene was differentially regulated in interactions with the beneficial bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and the pathogenic bacterium P. syringae. When hormone treatments were applied to A. thaliana (Col-0), each hormone treatment induced changes in HR4 gene expression. On the other hand, the expression of the RPW8.1 and RPW8.2 genes of Arabidopsis ecotype Ms-0 in interaction with T. atroviride was assessed. Interestingly, these genes are interaction-responsive; in particular, the RPW8.1 gene shows a very high level of expression in the later stages of interaction. These results indicate that HR4 and RPW8 genes could play a role in the establishment of Arabidopsis interactions with beneficial microbes.
