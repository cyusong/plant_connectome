To increase the potentiality of crop production for future food security, new technologies for plant breeding are required, including genome editing technology-being one of the most promising. Genome editing with the CRISPR/Cas system has attracted researchers in the last decade as a safer and easier tool for genome editing in a variety of living organisms including rice. Genome editing has transformed agriculture by reducing biotic and abiotic stresses and increasing yield. Recently, genome editing technologies have been developed quickly in order to avoid the challenges that genetically modified crops face. Developing transgenic-free edited plants without introducing foreign DNA has received regulatory approval in a number of countries. Several ongoing efforts from various countries are rapidly expanding to adopt the innovations. This review covers the mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas9, comparisons of CRISPR/Cas9 with other gene-editing technologies-including newly emerged Cas variants-and focuses on CRISPR/Cas9-targeted genes for rice crop improvement. We have further highlighted CRISPR/Cas9 vector construction model design and different bioinformatics tools for target site selection.
