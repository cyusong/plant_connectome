Soybeans are an important economic crop. As the most widely used growth regulator globally, the molecular mechanism of mepiquat chloride (DPC) in soybean remains unknown. In this study, RNA sequencing technology combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry were used to analyze the changes in the leaf transcriptome and metabolomics of soybean leaves at the seedling stage under DPC stress. The results showed that differentially expressed genes related to photosynthesis and cell wall synthesis were significantly downregulated at the transcriptional level. In addition, the syntheses of gibberellin, zeatin, brassinolide, and other plant hormones were inhibited in the signal transduction pathway of plant hormones, thereby inhibiting plant growth. In contrast, at the metabolic level, the expression levels of flavonoid differential metabolites were significantly increased, and the proportions of flavonoids in the two varieties were 61.5 and 66%, respectively. The combined analysis of transcriptome and metabolomics showed that the differential expressed genes and metabolites were mainly enriched in the isoflavonoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Principally, DPC inhibited plant growth but improved drought resistance. Our study is the first to report the molecular mechanism of DPC regulation in soybean, providing useful insights into the rational application of DPC in soybean.
