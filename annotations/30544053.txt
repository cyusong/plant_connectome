Fern spores and seeds initiate germination with fast water uptake, followed by a stationary phase with no appreciable water uptake and biochemical and metabolic processes that precede germination. After that, seed, germination is avoided by dehydration, as part of the priming treatments. After dehydration, seeds maintain their metabolic advances (hydration memory). As a result, rehydrated seeds germinate rapidly. We hypothesized that, as seeds, fern spores may be capable of developing hydration memory. To assess priming, spores of six fern species were exposed to: four or eight days of hydration in water (hydro-priming) or in a soil matrix (matrix-priming); or 1 month of hydration in the soil of the collection site (natural-priming). At the end of the treatments, the spores were dehydrated in the dark and germinated under laboratory conditions. Germination was evaluated using lag-time, germination rate and germination percentage. Priming treatments shortened lag time and/or increased germination rate or germination percentage in relation to the controls. Matrix-priming (8 days) reduced the spore germination percentage in three species. Our results provide evidence that fern spores possess a hydration memory that probably evolved in the soil bank and suggests that hydration-dehydration cycles within the natural soil might provide advantages for successful germination.
