Bertrand <i>et al</i> question our interpretation about warming effects on the thermophilization in forest plant communities and propose an alternative way to analyze climatic debt. We show that microclimate warming is a better predictor than macroclimate warming for studying forest plant community responses to warming. Their additional analyses do not affect or change our interpretations and conclusions.

microclimate: !better predictor than! macroclimate
Bertrand <i>et al</i>: !question! interpretation
forest plant community: !responds to! warming
microclimate: !affects! forest plant community
