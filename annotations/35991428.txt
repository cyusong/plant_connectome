The plant-specific SHORT INTERNODES/STYLISH (SHI/STY) proteins belong to a family of transcription factors that are involved in the formation and development of early lateral roots. However, the molecular evolution of this family is rarely reported. Here, a total of 195 <i>SHI/STY</i> genes were identified in 21 terrestrial plants, and the <i>Brassica</i> species is the focus of our research. Their physicochemical properties, chromosome location and duplication, motif distribution, exon-intron structures, genetic evolution, and expression patterns were systematically analyzed. These genes are divided into four clades (Clade 1/2/3/4) based on phylogenetic analysis. Motif distribution and gene structure are similar in each clade. SHI/STY proteins are localized in the nucleus by the prediction of subcellular localization. Collinearity analysis indicates that the <i>SHI/STYs</i> are relatively conserved in evolution. Whole-genome duplication is the main factor for their expansion. <i>SHI/STYs</i> have undergone intense purifying selection, but several positive selection sites are also identified. Most promoters of <i>SHI/STY</i> genes contain different types of <i>cis</i>-elements, such as light, stress, and hormone-responsive elements, suggesting that they may be involved in many biological processes. Protein-protein interaction predicted some important SHI/STY interacting proteins, such as LPAT4, MBOATs, PPR, and UBQ3. In addition, the RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis were studied in detail in rape. As a result, <i>SHI/STYs</i> are highly expressed in root and bud, and can be affected by <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>, drought, cold, and heat stresses. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses indicates that expression levels of <i>BnSHI/STYs</i> are significantly altered in different treatments (cold, salt, drought, IAA, auxin; ABA, abscisic acid; 6-BA, cytokinin). It provides a new understanding of the evolution and expansion of the <i>SHI/STY</i> family in land plants and lays a foundation for further research on their functions.
