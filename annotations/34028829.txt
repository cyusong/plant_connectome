The ability to fix nitrogen may confer a competitive advantage or disadvantage to symbiotic nitrogen-fixing plants depending on the availability of soil nitrogen and energy to fuel fixation. Understanding these costs and benefits of nitrogen fixation is critical to predicting ecosystem dynamics and nutrient cycling. We grew inoculated (with symbiotic bacteria) and uninoculated seedlings of Pentaclethra macroloba (a nitrogen-fixing tree species) both in isolation and with Virola koschnyi (a nonfixing species) under gradients of light and soil nitrogen to assess how the ability to fix nitrogen and fixation activity affect growth, biomass allocation, and responses to neighboring plants. Inoculation itself did not provide a growth advantage to nitrogen fixers, regardless of nitrogen limitation status. Higher nitrogen fixation rates increased biomass growth similarly for nitrogen-limited and nitrogen-saturated fixers. Nodule production was offset by reduced fine-root biomass for inoculated nitrogen fixers, resulting in no change in total belowground allocation associated with nitrogen fixation. Under nitrogen-limited conditions, inoculated nitrogen fixers partially downregulated fixation in the presence of a nonfixing neighbor. These results suggest that nitrogen fixation can provide a growth advantage, even under nitrogen-saturated conditions, and that nitrogen fixers may reduce fixation rates to minimize facilitation of neighbors.

Inoculation: !does not provide! growth advantage
Nitrogen fixation: !increases! biomass growth
Nodule production: !offset by! reduced fine-root biomass
Nitrogen fixers: !downregulate! fixation in presence of nonfixing neighbor
