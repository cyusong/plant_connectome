An understanding of flower and panicle development is crucial for improving yield and quality in majority of grass crops. In this study, we used mapping-based cloning to identify <i>MULTI</i>-<i>FLORET SPIKELET2</i> (<i>MFS2</i>), which encodes a MYB transcription factor and regulates flower and spikelet development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). In the <i>mfs2</i> mutant, specification of palea identity was severely disturbed and showed degradation or transformation into a lemma-like organ, and the number of all floral organs was increased to varying degrees. Due to the increase in the number of floral organs and development of extra transformed palea/marginal region of the palea-like organs, some <i>mfs2</i> spikelets had a tendency to produce two florets. These defects implied that the <i>mfs2</i> mutation caused abnormal specification of palea identity and partial loss of spikelet determination. We confirm that <i>MFS2</i> is a transcriptional repressor that shows strong repression activity by means of two typical ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic motifs, one of which locates at the C terminus and is capable of interaction with three rice TOPLESS and TOPLESS-related proteins. The results indicate that <i>MFS2</i> acts as a repressor that regulates floral organ identities and spikelet meristem determinacy in rice by forming a repression complex with rice TOPLESS and TOPLESS-related proteins.
