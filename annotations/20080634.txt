['20080634', 'Nuclear fusion is an essential process in the sexual reproduction of animals and  plants. In flowering plants, nuclear fusion occurs three times: once during  female gametogenesis, when the two polar nuclei fuse to produce the diploid  central cell nucleus, and twice during double fertilization. The yeast Ig binding  protein (BiP) is a molecular chaperone Hsp70 in the endoplasmic reticulum that  regulates nuclear membrane fusion during mating. Here we report that in  Arabidopsis thaliana, BiP is involved in the fusion of polar nuclei during female  gametophyte development. BiP-deficient mature female gametophytes contain two  unfused polar nuclei, in spite of their close contact. This indicates a  surprising conservation of BiP function in nuclear fusion between plants and  yeasts. We also found that endosperm nuclear division becomes aberrant after  fertilization of the BiP-deficient female gametophytes with wild-type pollen.  This is experimental evidence for the importance of fusion of the polar nuclei in  the proliferation of endosperm nuclei.', '2010 Jan 26', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0905795107', 'Nishikawa']
