Here we present the results of in vitro and in vivo studies of the influence of Mn²+ and Cu²+ on the peroxidative and oxidative catalytic functions of class III peroxidase. Complex peroxidase catalysis by intermediates generated in the reaction was analyzed by utilizing the activating effect of Mn²+ and the inhibitory effect of Cu²+ on the oxidative reaction in vitro. p-Coumaric acid was used as an enzyme substrate in the peroxidative reaction and as a cofactor in the oxidative reaction. In order to correlate the observed in vitro effects with the in vivo situation, we exposed maize plants to excess concentrations of Mn²+ and Cu²+ in the hydroponic solutions. Copper severely arrested plant growth, while manganese exerted no significant effect. The effects on peroxidase activity and isoforms profile of root soluble and cell wall bound fractions were studied. Inhibition of the peroxidase oxidative function by copper was reversible, localized in the cell wall, and accompanied by disappearance of some and appearance of new cationic isoforms. Copper-mediated changes were suppressed by the presence of manganese, although Mn²+ treatment per se did not affect the activity of the peroxidase enzyme. The results on the peroxidase activity in maize roots grown with excess Mn²+ and Cu²+ point to the coupling between the oxidative cycle, root growth and different peroxidase isoforms.
