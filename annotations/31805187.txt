Sucrose synthase (SuSy) is one of two enzyme families capable of catalyzing the first degradative step in sucrose utilization. Several earlier studies examining SuSy mutants in Arabidopsis failed to identify obvious phenotypic abnormalities compared with wild-type plants in normal growth environments, and as such a functional role for SuSy in the previously proposed cellulose biosynthetic process remains unclear. Our study systematically evaluated the precise subcellular localization of all six isoforms of Arabidopsis SuSy via live-cell imaging. We showed that yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-labeled SuSy1 and SuSy4 were expressed exclusively in phloem companion cells, and the sus1/sus4 double mutant accumulated sucrose under hypoxic conditions. SuSy5 and SuSy6 were found to be parietally localized in sieve elements and restricted only to the cytoplasm. SuSy2 was present in the endosperm and embryo of developing seeds, and SuSy3 was localized to the embryo and leaf stomata. No single isoform of SuSy was detected in developing xylem tissue of elongating stem, the primary site of cellulose deposition in plants. SuSy1 and SuSy4 were also undetectable in the protoxylem tracheary elements, which were induced by the vascular-related transcription factor VND7 during secondary cell wall formation. These findings implicate SuSy in the biological events related to sucrose translocation in phloem.
