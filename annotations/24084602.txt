Seed dormancy is an important trait in wheat (Trticum aestivum L.) and it can be released by germination-stimulating treatments such as after-ripening. Previously, we identified proteins specifically associated with after-ripening mediated developmental switches of wheat seeds from the state of dormancy to germination. Here, we report seed proteins that exhibited imbibition induced co-regulation in both dormant and after-ripened seeds of wheat, suggesting that the expression of these specific proteins/protein isoforms is not associated with the maintenance or release of seed dormancy in wheat.
