Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are vital components of the translation control system that regulates plant development and reproduction. The biological function of sly-miR156 was investigated by over-expression in tomato plants. Transgenic tomato plants exhibited a drastically altered phenotype, with reduced height, smaller but more numerous leaves, and smaller fruit. The inflorescence structure of sly-miR156 over-expressing plants phenocopied the sft mutant. The putative targets of sly-miR156 were identified by data base search and included six SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN (SBP)-box transcription factor genes. Their expression patterns were then determined in 35S-miR156a and wild type tomato plants. These target genes, as well as the tomato FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) ortholog SFT, were significantly down-regulated in sly-miR156 over-expressing plants. These studies reveal novel phenotypes regulated by miR156.
