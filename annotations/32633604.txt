Halo blight disease of beans is caused by a gram-negative bacterium, <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>phaseolicola</i>. The disease is prevalent in South America and Africa and causes crop loss for indigent people who rely on beans as a primary source of daily nutrition. In susceptible beans, <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>phaseolicola</i> causes water-soaking at the site of infection and produces phaseolotoxin, an inhibitor of bean arginine biosynthesis. In resistant beans, <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>phaseolicola</i> triggers a hypersensitive response that limits the spread of infection. Here, we used high-throughput mass spectrometry to interrogate the responses to two different <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>phaseolicola</i> isolates on a single line of common bean, <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> PI G19833, with a reference genome sequence. We obtained quantitative information for 4,135 bean proteins. A subset of 160 proteins with similar accumulation changes during both susceptible and resistant reactions included salicylic acid responders EDS1 and NDR1, ethylene and jasmonic acid biosynthesis enzymes, and proteins enabling vesicle secretion. These proteins revealed the activation of a basal defense involving hormonal responses and the mobilization of extracellular proteins. A subset of 29 proteins specific to hypersensitive immunity included SOBIR1, a G-type lectin receptor-like kinase, and enzymes needed for glucoside and phytoalexin production. Virus-induced gene silencing revealed that the G-type lectin receptor-like kinase suppresses bacterial infection. Together, the results define the proteomics of disease resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>phaseolicola</i> in beans and support a model whereby the induction of hypersensitive immunity reinstates defenses targeted by <i>P. syringae</i> pv. <i>phaseolicola</i>.
