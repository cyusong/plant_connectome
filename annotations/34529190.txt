A maize receptor kinase controls defense response to fungal pathogens by regulating jasmonic acid and antimicrobial phytoalexin production. Plants use a range of pattern recognition receptors to detect and respond to biotic threats. Some of these receptors contain leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains that recognize microbial proteins or peptides. Maize (Zea mays) has 226 LRR-receptor like kinases, making it challenging to identify those important for pathogen recognition. In this study, co-expression analysis with genes for jasmonic acid and phytoalexin biosynthesis was used to identify a fungal induced-receptor like protein kinase (FI-RLPK) likely involved in the response to fungal pathogens. Loss-of-function mutants in fi-rlpk displayed enhanced susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus and reduced accumulation of jasmonic acid and the anti-microbial phytoalexins -kauralexins and zealexins- in infected tissues. In contrast, fi-rlpk mutants displayed increased resistance to stem inoculation with the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum. These data indicate that FI-RLPK is important for fungal recognition and activation of defenses, and that F. graminearum may be able to exploit FI-RLPK function to increase its virulence.
