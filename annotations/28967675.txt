Lesion mimic mutants are valuable to unravel the mechanisms governing the programmed cell death (PCD) process. Uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose-glucose (UDPG) functions as a signaling molecule activating multiple pathways in animals, but little is known about its function in plants. Two novel allelic mutants of spl29 with typical PCD characters and reduced pollen viability were obtained by ethane methyl sulfonate mutagenesis in rice cv Kitaake. The enzymatic analyses showed that UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1) irreversibly catalyzed the decomposition of UDPG. Its activity was severely destroyed and caused excessive UDPG accumulation, with the lesion occurrence associated with the enhanced caspase-like activities in spl29-2. At the transcriptional level, several key genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response were abnormally expressed. Moreover, exogenous UDPG could aggravate lesion initiation and development in spl29-2. Importantly, exogenous UDPG and its derivative UDP-N-acetylglucosamine could induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and lesion mimics in Kitaake seedlings. These results suggest that the excessive accumulation of UDPG, caused by the mutation of UAP1, was a key biochemical event resulting in the lesion mimics in spl29-2. Thus, our findings revealed that UDPG might be an important component involved in ROS accumulation, PCD execution and lesion mimicking in rice, which also provided new clues for investigating the connection between sugar metabolism and PCD process.
