The patterning of adaxial-abaxial tissues plays a vital role in the morphology of lateral organs, which is maintained by antagonism between the genes that specify adaxial and abaxial tissue identity. The homeo-domain leucine zipper class III (HD-ZIP III) family genes regulate adaxial identity; however, little information is known about the physical interactions or transcriptionally regulated downstream genes of HD-ZIP III. In this study, we identified a dominant rice mutant, lateral floret 1 (lf1), which has defects in lateral organ polarity. LF1 encodes the HD-ZIP III transcription factor, which expressed in the adaxial area of lateral organs. LF1 can activate directly the expression of LITTLE ZIPPER family gene OsZPR4 and HD-ZIP II family gene OsHOX1, and OsZPR4 and OsHOX1 respectively interact with LF1 to form a heterodimer to repress the transcriptional activity of LF1. LF1 influences indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content by directly regulating the expression of OsYUCCA6. Therefore, LF1 forms negative feedback loops between OsZPR4 and OsHOX1 to affect IAA content, leading to the regulation of lateral organs polarity development. These results reveal the cross-talk among HD-ZIP III, LITTLE ZIPPER, and HD-ZIP II proteins and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the polarity development of lateral organs.
