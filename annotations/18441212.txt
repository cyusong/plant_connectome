['18441212', 'To cope with water stress, plants must be able to effectively sense, respond to,  and adapt to changes in water availability. The Arabidopsis thaliana plasma  membrane His kinase ATHK1 has been suggested to act as an osmosensor that detects  water stress and initiates downstream responses. Here, we provide direct genetic  evidence that ATHK1 not only is involved in the water stress response during  early vegetative stages of plant growth but also plays a unique role in the  regulation of desiccation processes during seed formation. To more  comprehensively identify genes involved in the downstream pathways affected by  the ATHK1-mediated response to water stress, we created a large-scale summary of  expression data, termed the AtMegaCluster. In the AtMegaCluster, hierarchical  clustering techniques were used to compare whole-genome expression levels in  athk1 mutants with the expression levels reported in publicly available data sets  of Arabidopsis tissues grown under a wide variety of conditions. These  experiments revealed that ATHK1 is cotranscriptionally regulated with several  Arabidopsis response regulators, together with two proteins containing novel  sequences. Since overexpression of ATHK1 results in increased water stress  tolerance, our observations suggest a new top-down route to increasing drought  resistance via receptor-mediated increases in sensing water status, rather than  through genetically engineered changes in downstream transcription factors or  specific osmolytes.', '2008 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.055871', 'Sussman']
