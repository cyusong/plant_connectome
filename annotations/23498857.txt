['23498857', 'Proper root growth is crucial for anchorage, exploration, and exploitation of the  soil substrate. Root growth is highly sensitive to a variety of environmental  cues, among them water and nutrient availability have a great impact on root  development. Phosphorus (P) availability is one of the most limiting nutrients  that affect plant growth and development under natural and agricultural  environments. Root growth in the direction of the long axis proceeds from the  root tip and requires the coordinated activities of cell proliferation, cell  elongation and cell differentiation. Here we report a novel gene, APSR1 (Altered  Phosphate Starvation Response1), involved in root meristem maintenance. The loss  of function mutant apsr1-1 showed a reduction in primary root length and root  apical meristem size, short differentiated epidermal cells and long root hairs.  Expression of APSR1 gene decreases in response to phosphate starvation and  apsr1-1 did not show the typical progressive decrease of undifferentiated cells  at root tip when grown under P limiting conditions. Interestingly, APSR1  expression pattern overlaps with root zones of auxin accumulation. Furthermore,  apsr1-1 showed a clear decrease in the level of the auxin transporter PIN7. These  data suggest that APSR1 is required for the coordination of cell processes  necessary for correct root growth in response to phosphate starvation conceivably  by direct or indirect modulation of PIN7. We also propose, based on its nuclear  localization and structure, that APSR1 may potentially be a member of a novel  group of transcription factors.', '2013 May', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2012.12.015', 'Herrera-Estrella']
