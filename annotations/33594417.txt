Intraorganellar proteases and cytoplasmic proteolytic systems such as autophagy orchestrate the degradation of organellar proteins to ensure organelle homeostasis in eukaryotic cells. The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an ideal unicellular model organism for elucidating the mechanisms maintaining proteostasis in chloroplasts. However, the autophagic pathways targeting the photosynthetic organelles of these algae have not been clearly elucidated. Here, we explored the role of autophagy in chloroplast protein degradation in Chlamydomonas cells. We labeled the chloroplast protein Rubisco small subunit (RBCS) with the yellow fluorescent protein Venus in a Chlamydomonas strain in which expression of the chloroplast gene clpP1, encoding a major catalytic subunit of the chloroplast Clp protease, can be conditionally repressed to selectively perturb chloroplast protein homeostasis. We observed transport of both nucleus-encoded RBCS-Venus fusion protein and chloroplast-encoded Rubisco large subunit (rbcL) from the chloroplast to the vacuoles in response to chloroplast proteotoxic stress induced by clpP1 inhibition. This process was retarded by the addition of autophagy inhibitors. Biochemical detection of lytic cleavage of RBCS-Venus supported the notion that Rubisco is degraded in the vacuoles via autophagy. Electron microscopy revealed vacuolar accumulation of autophagic vesicles and exposed their ultrastructure during repression of clpP1 expression. Treatment with an autophagy activator also induced chloroplast autophagy. These results indicate that autophagy contributes to chloroplast protein degradation in Chlamydomonas cells.
