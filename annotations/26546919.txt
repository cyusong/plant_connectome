CDPK kinases are a unique class of calcium sensor/responders that regulate many growth and developmental processes as well as stress responses of plants. PnCDPK1 kinase from Pharbitis nil is regulated by light and contributes to seed germination, seedling growth and flower formation. Following an earlier work in which we identified the PnCDPK1 coding sequence and a 330bp long 3'UTR (untranslated region), we present for the first time the genomic organization of PnCDPK1, including intron analysis and the gene copy number designation. We completed the research by identifying the 5'-flanking region of PnCDPK1 and analyzed it in silico, which led to the discovery of several cis-regulatory elements involved in light regulation, embryogenesis and seed development. The functional analysis of P. nil CDPK showed characterization of the PnCDPK1 transcript and PnCDPK protein level during seed formation and fruit maturation. The greatest amount of PnCDPK1 mRNA was present in the last stages of seed maturation. Moreover, two PnCDPK proteins of different molecular masses were discovered during fruit development, showing various protein accumulation and activity profile. The 56kDa protein dominated in the early stages of fruit development, whereas the smaller protein (52kDa) was prominent in the latter stages.
