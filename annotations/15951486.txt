The effects of suppressing deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) have been examined in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv UCT5). DHS mediates the first of two sequential enzymatic reactions that activate eukaryotic translation initiation factor-5A (eIF-5A) by converting a conserved Lys to the unusual amino acid, deoxyhypusine. DHS protein levels were suppressed in transgenic plants by expressing the 3'-untranslated region of tomato DHS under regulation of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter. Fruit from the transgenic plants ripened normally, but exhibited delayed postharvest softening and senescence that correlated with suppression of DHS protein levels. Northern-blot analysis indicated that all four gene family members of tomato eIF-5A are expressed in fruit, and that three are up-regulated in parallel with enhancement of DHS mRNA as the fruit begin to senesce and soften. Transgenic plants in which DHS was more strongly suppressed were male sterile, did not produce fruit, and had larger, thicker leaves with enhanced levels of chlorophyll. The activity of PSII was 2 to 3 times higher in these transgenic leaves than in corresponding leaves of wild-type plants, and there was also enhanced deposition of starch in the stems. The data collectively indicate that suppression of DHS has pleiotropic effects on growth and development of tomato. This may, in turn, reflect the fact that there is a single DHS gene in tomato and that its cognate protein is involved in the activation of four distinct isoforms of eIF-5A.
