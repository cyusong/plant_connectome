Jasmonate (JA) signaling plays an important role in regulating both plant defense and development. We have recently reported that the phytochrome and flowering time1 (PFT1) gene, which encodes the mediator25 subunit of the plant Mediator complex, is a key regulator of JA regulated transcription. We showed that the pft1 mutant had attenuated expression of a wide range of JA responsive genes and altered resistance to fungal pathogens. Here we examine the position of PFT1/MED25 within the JA pathway and discuss its role in "mediating" the JA response.

PFT1: !regulates! JA responsive genes
PFT1: !alters! resistance to fungal pathogens
PFT1: !mediates! JA response
