Trans-zeatin is a kind of cytokinins that plays a crucial role in plant growth and development. The master trans-zeatin O-glucosyltransferase of Arabidopsis thaliana, UGT85A1, has been previously identified through biochemical approach. To determine the in planta role of UGT85A1 gene, the characterization of transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing UGT85A1 was carried out. Under normal conditions, transgenic Arabidopsis did not display clearly altered phenotypes. A remarkable alteration is that the accumulation level of the trans-zeatin O-glucosides was significantly increased in UGT85A1 overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis, while other forms of cytokinins kept the similar concentrations compared to the wild type. When treated with exogenously applied trans-zeatin, UGT85A1 overexpressing Arabidopsis showed much less sensitivity to trans-zeatin in primary root elongation and lateral root formation. Meanwhile, the chlorophyll content of detached leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis was much lower than wild type. Studies of spatial-temporal expression patterns showed that UGT85A1 was mainly expressed in the early seedlings and developing seeds. Analysis of subcellular localization suggested that UGT85A1 was localized to cytoplasm and nucleus. Taken together, our data suggest that overexpression of Arabidopsis glucosyltransferase UGT85A1 influences trans-zeatin homeostasis and trans-zeatin responses likely through O-glucosylation in planta.
