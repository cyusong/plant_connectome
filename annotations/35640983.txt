Spikelets are highly specialized and short-lived branches and function as a constitutional unit of the complex grass inflorescences. A series of genetic, genomic, and developmental studies across different clades of the family have called for and permitted a synthesis on the regulation and evolution of spikelets, and hence inflorescence diversity. Here, we have revisited the identity specification of a spikelet, focusing on the diagnostic features of a spikelet from morphological, developmental, and molecular perspectives. Particularly, recent studies on a collection of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum spp.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.) mutants have highlighted a set of transcription factors that are important in the control of spikelet identity and the patterning of floral parts of a spikelet. In addition, we have endeavored to clarify some puzzling issues on the (in)determinacy and modifications of spikelets over the course of evolution. Meanwhile, genomes of two sister taxa of the remaining grass species have again demonstrated the importance of genome duplication and subsequent gene losses on the evolution of spikelets. Accordingly, we argue that changes in the orthologs of spikelet-related genes could be critical for the development and evolution of the spikelet, an evolutionary innovation in the grass family. Likewise, the conceptual discussions on the regulation of a fundamental unit of compound inflorescences could be translated into other organismal groups where compound structures are similarly formed, permitting a comparative perspective on the control of biological complexity.
