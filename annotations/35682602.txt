RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) form complex interactions with RNA to regulate the cell's activities including cell development and disease resistance. RNA-binding proteome (RBPome) aims to profile and characterize the RNAs and proteins that interact with each other to carry out biological functions. Generally, RNA-centric and protein-centric ribonomic approaches have been successfully developed to profile RBPome in different organisms including plants and animals. Further, more and more novel methods that were firstly devised and applied in mammalians have shown great potential to unravel RBPome in plants such as RNA-interactome capture (RIC) and orthogonal organic phase separation (OOPS). Despise the development of various robust and state-of-the-art ribonomics techniques, genome-wide RBP identifications and characterizations in plants are relatively fewer than those in other eukaryotes, indicating that ribonomics techniques have great opportunities in unraveling and characterizing the RNA-protein interactions in plant species. Here, we review all the available approaches for analyzing RBPs in living organisms. Additionally, we summarize the transcriptome-wide approaches to characterize both the coding and non-coding RBPs in plants and the promising use of RBPome for booming agriculture.
