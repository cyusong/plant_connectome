Identification of interacting proteins will help to investigate further the relationship between CPSAR1 and the vesicle transport system or the ribosomes. Thus, we adopted a bioinformatic approach, using the publicly available Arabidopsis thaliana trans-factor and cis-element prediction database, ATTED-II (http://atted.jp/), to identify putative protein interactors. The proteins directly linked to CPSAR1 were almost exclusively nucleus encoded and several were involved in protein synthesis of which three were thylakoid localized. The list of putative interacting proteins does not exclude any of the previous proposed actions of CPSAR1 but encourage more detailed examination of the role of CPSAR1.
