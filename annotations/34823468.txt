Sucrose (Suc) hydrolysis is directly associated with plants tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. Invertase (INV) enzymes irreversibly catalyze Suc degradation to produce glucose (Glc) and fructose (Frc). However, genome-wide identification and function of individual members of the INV gene family in Poncirus trifoliata or its Citrus relatives in response to abiotic stresses are not fully understood. In this report, fourteen non-redundant PtrINV family members were identified in P. trifoliata including seven alkaline/neutral INV genes (PtrA/NINV1-7), two vacuolar INV genes (PtrVINV1-2), and five cell wall INV isoforms (PtrCWINV1-5). A comprehensive analysis based on the biochemical characteristics, the chromosomal location, the exon-intron structures and the evolutionary relationships demonstrated the conservation and the divergence of PtrINVs. In addition, expression analysis of INV genes during several abiotic stresses in various tissues indicated the central role of A/NINV7 among INV family members in response to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that high accumulation of Suc, Glc, Frc and total sugar contents were directly correlated with the elevated activities of soluble INV enzymes in the cold-tolerant P. trifoliata, C. ichangensis and C. sinensis, demonstrating the potential role of soluble INV enzymes for the cold tolerance of Citrus. This work offered a framework for understanding the physiological role of INV genes and laid a foundation for future functional studies of these genes in response to abiotic stresses.
