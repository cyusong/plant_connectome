Analyses of the function of Arabidopsis Calmodulin7 (CAM7) in concert with multiple regulatory proteins involved in various signal transduction processes. Calmodulin (CaM) plays various regulatory roles in multiple signaling pathways in eukaryotes. Arabidopsis CALMODULIN 7 (CAM7) is a unique member of the CAM family that works as a transcription factor in light signaling pathways. CAM7 works in concert with CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5, and plays an important role in seedling development. Further, it is involved in the regulation of the activity of various Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated channels such as cyclic nucleotide gated channel 6 (CNGC6), CNGC14 and auto-inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase 8. Recent studies further indicate that CAM7 is also an integral part of multiple signaling pathways including hormone, immunity and stress. Here, we review the recent advances in understanding the multifaceted role of CAM7. We highlight the open-ended questions, and also discuss the diverse aspects of CAM7 characterization that need to be addressed for comprehensive understanding of its cellular functions.
