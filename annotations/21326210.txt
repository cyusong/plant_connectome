['21326210', 'Programmed cell death (PCD) has a key role in defence and development of all  multicellular organisms. In plants, there is a large gap in our knowledge of the  molecular machinery involved at the various stages of PCD, especially the early  steps. Here, we identify kiss of death (KOD) encoding a 25-amino-acid peptide  that activates a PCD pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. Two mutant alleles of KOD  exhibited a reduced PCD of the suspensor, a single file of cells that support  embryo development, and a reduced PCD of root hairs after a 55 degrees C heat shock. KOD  expression was found to be inducible by biotic and abiotic stresses. Furthermore,  KOD expression was sufficient to cause death in leaves or seedlings and to  activate caspase-like activities. In addition, KOD-induced PCD required light in  leaves and was repressed by the PCD-suppressor genes AtBax inhibitor 1 and p35.  KOD expression resulted in depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, placing  KOD above mitochondria dysfunction, an early step in plant PCD. A KODColon, two colonsGFP fusion,  however, localized in the cytosol of cells and not mitochondria.', '2011 Mar 16', 'EMBO J', '10.1038/emboj.2011.14', 'Gallois']
