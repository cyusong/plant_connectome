The wheat dough quality is of great significance for the end-use of flour. Some genes have been cloned for controlling the protein fractions, grain protein content, starch synthase, grain hardness, etc. Using a unigene map of the recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for "TN 18 × LM 6," we mapped a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for dough stability time (ST) and SDS-sedimentation values (SV) on chromosome 6A (<i>QSt/Sv-6A-2851</i>). The peak position of the QTL covered two candidate unigenes, and we speculated that <i>TraesCS6A02G077000</i> (a xylanase inhibitor protein) was the primary candidate gene (named the <i>TaXip</i> gene). The target loci containing the three homologous genes <i>TaXip-6A</i>, <i>TaXip-6B</i>, and <i>TaXip-6D</i> were edited in the variety "Fielder" by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9). Two mutant types in the T<sub>2:3</sub> generation were obtained (<i>aaBBDD</i> and <i>AAbbdd</i>) with about 120 plants per type. The SVs of <i>aaBBDD</i>, <i>AAbbdd</i>, and WT were 31.77, 27.30, and 20.08 ml, respectively. The SVs of the <i>aaBBDD</i> and <i>AAbbdd</i> were all significantly higher than those of the wild type (WT), and the <i>aaBBDD</i> was significantly higher than the <i>AAbbdd</i>. The STs of <i>aaBBDD</i>, <i>AAbbdd</i>, and WT were 2.60, 2.24, and 2.25 min, respectively. The ST for the <i>aaBBDD</i> was significantly higher than that for WT and was not significantly different between WT and <i>AAbbdd</i>. The above results indicated that XIP <i>in vivo</i> can significantly affect wheat dough quality. The selection of <i>TaXip</i> gene should be a new strategy for developing high-quality varieties in wheat breeding programs.
