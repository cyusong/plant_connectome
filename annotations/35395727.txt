1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid (ACC) is the immediate precursor of the plant hormone ethylene. However, recent studies have suggested that ACC also acts as a signaling molecule to regulate development and growth independently from ethylene biosynthesis. In red algae, ACC stimulates the switch from a vegetative to a sexual reproductive phase. However, despite evidence that ACC signaling in plants and algae is widespread, the mechanistic basis of the ACC signaling pathway remains unknown. We demonstrate that exogenous ACC increased the activity of phospholipase D (PLD) and induced the accumulation of PLD transcripts in the marine red alga Neopyropia yezoensis. The product of PLD, the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA), also increased in response to ACC. Furthermore, the pharmacological inhibition of PLD by 1-butanol blocked ACC-induced spermatangia and carpospore production, but the inactive isomer t-butanol did not. In addition, 1-butanol prevented ACC-induced growth inhibition and inhibited transcript accumulation of genes upregulated by ACC, including extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes, and alleviated the transcriptional decrease of genes downregulated by ACC, including photosynthesis-related genes. These results indicate that PLD is a positive regulator of sexual cell differentiation and a negative regulator of growth. This study demonstrates that PLD and its product, PA, are components of ACC signaling during sexual reproduction in N. yezoensis.
