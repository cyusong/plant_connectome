['16648367', 'Imprinted genes are expressed predominantly from either their paternal or their  maternal allele. To date, all imprinted genes identified in plants are expressed  in the endosperm. In Arabidopsis thaliana, maternal imprinting has been clearly  demonstrated for the Polycomb group gene MEDEA (MEA) and for FWA. Direct repeats  upstream of FWA are subject to DNA methylation. However, it is still not clear to  what extent similar cis-acting elements may be part of a conserved molecular  mechanism controlling maternally imprinted genes. In this work, we show that the  Polycomb group gene FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2) is imprinted.  Maintenance of FIS2 imprinting depends on DNA methylation, whereas loss of DNA  methylation does not affect MEA imprinting. DNA methylation targets a small  region upstream of FIS2 distinct from the target of DNA methylation associated  with FWA. We show that FWA and FIS2 imprinting requires the maintenance of DNA  methylation throughout the plant life cycle, including male gametogenesis and  endosperm development. Our data thus demonstrate that parental genomic imprinting  in plants depends on diverse cis-elements and mechanisms dependent or independent  of DNA methylation. We propose that imprinting has evolved under constraints  linked to the evolution of plant reproduction and not by the selection of a  specific molecular mechanism.', '2006 Jun', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.106.041178', 'Berger']
