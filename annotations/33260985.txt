The adaptation strategies of halophytic seaside barley <i>Hordeum marinum</i> to high salinity and osmotic stress were investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, as well as ionomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic approaches. When compared with cultivated barley, seaside barley exhibited a better plant growth rate, higher relative plant water content, lower osmotic pressure, and sustained photosynthetic activity under high salinity, but not under osmotic stress. As seaside barley is capable of controlling Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations in leaves at high salinity, the roots appear to play the central role in salinity adaptation, ensured by the development of thinner and likely lignified roots, as well as fine-tuning of membrane transport for effective management of restriction of ion entry and sequestration, accumulation of osmolytes, and minimization of energy costs. By contrast, more resources and energy are required to overcome the consequences of osmotic stress, particularly the severity of reactive oxygen species production and nutritional disbalance which affect plant growth. Our results have identified specific mechanisms for adaptation to salinity in seaside barley which differ from those activated in response to osmotic stress. Increased knowledge around salt tolerance in halophytic wild relatives will provide a basis for improved breeding of salt-tolerant crops.
