Daylight UV-B (UV-B) radiation (280-315 nm) is, because of its photochemical effects and potential destructive impact, an important environmental factor for plants. After decades of fruitless attempts, a receptor molecule, UVR8, for sensing of ambient UV-B radiation by plants has been characterized, and the initial steps in signal transduction have been identified. There are, however, other signaling pathways, and there are apparent contradictions in the literature. There is still much to find out about the complex signaling network in plants for processing of information about the daylight surrounding them.
