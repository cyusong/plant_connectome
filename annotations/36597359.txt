RNA quality control nonsense-mediated decay is involved in viral restriction in both plants and animals. However, it is not known whether two other RNA quality control pathways, nonstop decay and no-go decay, are capable of restricting viruses in plants. Here, we show that the evolutionarily conserved Pelota-Hbs1 complex negatively regulates infection of plant viruses in the family Potyviridae (termed potyvirids), the largest group of plant RNA viruses that accounts for more than half of the viral crop damage worldwide. Pelota enables the recognition of the functional G<sub>1-2</sub>A<sub>6-7</sub> motif in the P3 cistron, which is conserved in almost all potyvirids. This allows Pelota to target the virus and act as a viral restriction factor. Furthermore, Pelota interacts with the SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme SCE1 and is SUMOylated in planta. Blocking Pelota SUMOylation disrupts the ability to recruit Hbs1 and inhibits viral RNA degradation. These findings reveal the functional importance of Pelota SUMOylation during the infection of potyvirids in plants.
