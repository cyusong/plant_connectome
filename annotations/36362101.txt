Nitrogen (N) is a major limiting factor for plant growth and crop production. The use of N fertilizer in forestry production is increasing each year, but the loss is substantial. Mastering the regulatory mechanisms of N uptake and transport is a key way to improve plant nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). However, this has rarely been studied in pecans. In this study, 10 AMT and 69 NRT gene family members were identified and systematically analyzed from the whole pecan genome using a bioinformatics approach, and the expression patterns of <i>AMT</i> and <i>NRT</i> genes and the uptake characteristics of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in pecan were analyzed by aeroponic cultivation at varying NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ratios (0/0, 0/100,25/75, 50/50, 75/25,100/0 as CK, T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5). The results showed that gene duplication was the main reason for the amplification of the <i>AMT</i> and <i>NRT</i> gene families in pecan, both of which experienced purifying selection. Based on qRT-PCR results, <i>CiAMTs</i> were primarily expressed in roots, and <i>CiNRTs</i> were majorly expressed in leaves, which were consistent with the distribution of pecan NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in the organs. The expression levels of <i>CiAMTs</i> and <i>CiNRTs</i> were mainly significantly upregulated under N deficiency and T4 treatment. Meanwhile, T4 treatment significantly increased the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations as well as the Vmax and Km values of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in pecans, and Vmax/Km indicated that pecan seedlings preferred to absorb NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. In summary, considering the single N source of T5, we suggested that the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>/NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ratio of 75:25 was more beneficial to improve the NUE of pecan, thus increasing pecan yield, which provides a theoretical basis for promoting the scale development of pecan and provides a basis for further identification of the functions of <i>AMT</i> and <i>NRT</i> genes in the N uptake and transport process of pecan.
