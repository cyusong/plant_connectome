['25846821', "The structure and function of photosystem II (PSII) are highly susceptible to  photo-oxidative damage induced by high-fluence or fluctuating light. However,  many of the mechanistic details of how PSII homeostasis is maintained under  photoinhibitory light remain to be determined. We describe an analysis of the  Arabidopsis thaliana gene At5g07020, which encodes an unannotated integral  thylakoid membrane protein. Loss of the protein causes altered PSII function  under high-irradiance light, and hence it is named 'Maintenance of PSII under  High light 1' (MPH1). The MPH1 protein co-purifies with PSII core complexes and  co-immunoprecipitates core proteins. Consistent with a role in PSII structure,  PSII complexes (supercomplexes, dimers and monomers) of the mph1 mutant are less  stable in plants subjected to photoinhibitory light. Accumulation of PSII core  proteins is compromised under these conditions in the presence of translational  inhibitors. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the mutant has enhanced  PSII protein damage rather than defective repair. These data are consistent with  the distribution of the MPH1 protein in grana and stroma thylakoids, and its  interaction with PSII core complexes. Taken together, these results strongly  suggest a role for MPH1 in the protection and/or stabilization of PSII under  high-light stress in land plants.", '2015 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12845', 'Last']
