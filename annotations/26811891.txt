The resistance encountered by a seedling as it pushes through the soil causes inhibition of stem elongation and stimulates stem thickening, facilitating soil penetration. A new study demonstrates that two proteolytic pathways work in double-negative fashion - one targeting the other - to protect transcription factors central to this response.

Transcription factor: !central to! stem elongation response
Proteolytic pathway: !targets! other proteolytic pathway
Proteolytic pathway: !protects! transcription factor
