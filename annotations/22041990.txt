The ectopic expression of FOREVER YOUNG FLOWER (FYF), a MADS box gene in Arabidopsis, caused significant delay of senescence and a deficiency of abscission in flowers of transgenic Arabidopsis. It was proposed that the function of the FYF gene was related to the regulation of senescence and abscission. This hypothesis was further supported by one line of evidence reported in this study. The evidence is the similar delay of flower senescence and abscission observed in transgenic Arabidopsis ectopically expressing OnFYF, an FYF homolog from the Oncidium orchid, a monocot. This data suggested that the function of FYF homologs in regulating flower senescence and abscission was highly conserved in both dicot and monocot plants.
