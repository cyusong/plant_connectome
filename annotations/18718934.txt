Despite the importance of extracellular events in cell wall organization and biogenesis, the mechanisms and related factors are largely unknown. We isolated an allele of the shaven3 (shv3) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which exhibits ruptured root hair cells during tip growth. SHV3 encodes a novel protein with two tandemly repeated glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase-like domains and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, and several of its paralogs are found in Arabidopsis. Here, we report the detailed characterization of mutants of SHV3 and one of its paralogs, SVL1. The shv3 and svl1 double mutant exhibited additional defects, including swollen guard cells, aberrant expansion of the hypocotyl epidermis and ectopic lignin deposits, suggesting decreased rigidity of the cell wall. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and measurement of the cell wall components indicated an altered cellulose content and pectin modification with cross-linking in the double mutant. Furthermore, we found that the ruptured root hair phenotype of shv3 was suppressed by increasing the amount of borate, which is supposed to be involved in pectic polysaccharide cross-linking, in the medium. These findings indicate that SHV3 and its paralogs are novel important factors involved in primary cell wall organization.
