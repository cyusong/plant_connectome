Molecular mimicry is one of the evolutionary strategies that parasites use to manipulate the host metabolism and perform an effective infection. This phenomenon has been observed in several animal and plant pathosystems. Despite the relevance of this mechanism in pathogenesis, little is known about it in fungus-plant interactions. For that reason, we performed an in silico method to select plausible mimicry candidates for the <i>Ustilago maydis</i>-maize interaction. Our methodology used a tripartite sequence comparison between the parasite, the host, and nonparasitic organisms' genomes. Furthermore, we used RNA sequencing information to identify gene coexpression, and we determined subcellular localization to detect potential cases of colocalization in the imitator-imitated pairs. With these approximations, we found a putative extracellular formin in <i>U. maydis</i> with the potential to rearrange the host cell cytoskeleton. In parallel, we detected at least two maize genes involved in the cytoskeleton rearrangement differentially expressed under <i>U. maydis</i> infection; thus, this find increases the expectation for the potential mimicry role of the fungal protein. The use of several sources of data led us to develop a strict and replicable in silico methodology to detect molecular mimicry in pathosystems with enough information available. Furthermore, this is the first time that a genomewide search has been performed to detect molecular mimicry in a <i>U. maydis</i>-maize system. Additionally, to allow the reproducibility of this experiment and the use of this pipeline, we created a Web server called Molecular Mimicry Finder.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
