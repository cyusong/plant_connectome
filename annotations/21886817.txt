['21886817', 'Protein superfamilies can exhibit considerable diversification of function among  their members in various organisms. The DJ-1 superfamily is composed of proteins  that are principally involved in stress response and are widely distributed in  all kingdoms of life. The model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains  three close homologs of animal DJ-1, all of which are tandem duplications of the  DJ-1 domain. Consequently, the plant DJ-1 homologs are likely pseudo-dimeric  proteins composed of a single polypeptide chain. We report that one A. thaliana  DJ-1 homolog (AtDJ1C) is the first DJ-1 homolog in any organism that is required  for viability. Homozygous disruption of the AtDJ1C gene results in non-viable,  albino seedlings that can be complemented by expression of wild-type or  epitope-tagged AtDJ1C. The plastids from these dj1c plants lack thylakoid  membranes and granal stacks, indicating that AtDJ1C is required for proper  chloroplast development. AtDJ1C is expressed early in leaf development when  chloroplasts mature, but is downregulated in older tissue, consistent with a  proposed role in plastid development. In addition to its plant-specific function,  AtDJ1C is an atypical member of the DJ-1 superfamily that lacks a conserved  cysteine residue that is required for the functions of most other superfamily  members. The essential role for AtDJ1C in chloroplast maturation expands the  known functional diversity of the DJ-1 superfamily and provides the first  evidence of a role for specialized DJ-1-like proteins in eukaryotic development.', '2011', 'PLoS One', '10.1371/journal.pone.0023731', 'Stone']
