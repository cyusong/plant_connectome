['18557833', 'The function of a putative xyloglucan xylosyltransferase from Arabidopsis  thaliana (At1g74380; XXT5) was studied. The XXT5 gene is expressed in all plant  tissues, with higher levels of expression in roots, stems and cauline leaves. A  T-DNA insertion in the XXT5 gene generates a readily visible root hair phenotype  (root hairs are shorter and form bubble-like extrusions at the tip), and also  causes the alteration of the main root cellular morphology. Biochemical  characterization of cell wall polysaccharides isolated from xxt5 mutant seedlings  demonstrated decreased xyloglucan quantity and reduced glucan backbone  substitution with xylosyl residues. Immunohistochemical analyses of xxt5 plants  revealed a selective decrease in some xyloglucan epitopes, whereas the  distribution patterns of epitopes characteristic for other cell wall  polysaccharides remained undisturbed. Transformation of xxt5 plants with a  35S::HA-XXT5 construct resulted in complementation of the morphological,  biochemical and immunological phenotypes, restoring xyloglucan content and  composition to wild-type levels. These data provide evidence that XXT5 is a  xyloglucan alpha-1,6-xylosyltransferase, and functions in the biosynthesis of  xyloglucan.', '2008 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03580.x', 'Raikhel']
