Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are an important class of non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) that have been shown to regulate gene expression. Using strand-specific RNA sequencing, 36,317 NAT pairs were identified, and 5,536 were specifically expressed under heat stress. We found distinct expression patterns between vegetative and reproductive tissues for both coding genes and genes encoding NATs. Genes for heat-responsive NATs are associated with relatively high levels of H3K4me3 and low levels of H3K27me2/3. On the other hand, small RNAs are significantly enriched in sequence overlapping regions of NAT pairs, and a large number of heat-responsive NATs pairs serve as potential precursors of nat-siRNAs. Collectively, our results suggest epigenetic modifications and small RNAs play important roles in the regulation of NAT expression, and highlight the potential significance of heat-inducible NATs.
