['16621844', 'To elucidate the mechanism of cellulose synthesis, we isolated a mutant of  Arabidopsis (changed sensitivity to cellulose synthesis inhibitors 1, css1) that  showed changed sensitivity to cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor. The analysis of  phenotypes indicated that the css1 mutation influenced various fundamental  metabolic pathways including amino acid metabolism, triacylglycerol degradation  and polysaccharide synthesis (cellulose and starch) during the early stage of  plant growth. Unexpectedly, the map-based cloning of the gene responsible for the  css1 mutation identified a protein (At-nMat1a) that was assumed to be a splicing  factor of the mitochondrial group II intron. In accordance with this result, this  mutant exhibited improper splicing of the mitochondrial NAD4 transcript. We  noticed that the phenotypes of the css1 mutant are similar to the responses to  anoxia that hinders mitochondrial aerobic respiration. It seems that the defect  in the function of mitochondria influences various aspects of fundamental  cellular metabolism including cellulose synthesis. Our results suggested that  sucrose synthase (SuSy), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cellulose,  plays key roles in the connection between mitochondria and cellulose synthesis.  The isolation of the css1 mutant also provides a useful resource in the study of  post-transcriptional gene regulation in mitochondria.', '2006 Jun', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcj051', 'Sakurai']
