Self-incompatibility (SI) protects plants from inbreeding depression due to self-pollination and promotes the outcrossing process to maintain a high degree of heterozygosity during evolution. <i>Corylus</i> is an important woody oil and nut species that shows sporophytic SI (SSI). Yet the molecular mechanism of SI in <i>Corylus</i> remains largely unknown. Here we conducted self- ("<i>Dawei"</i> × "<i>Dawei"</i>) and cross-pollination ("<i>Dawei"</i> × "<i>Liaozhen No. 7"</i>) experiments and then performed an RNA-Seq analysis to investigate the mechanism of pollen-stigma interactions and identify those genes that may be responsible for SSI in <i>Corylus</i>. We uncovered 19,163 up- and 13,314 downregulated genes from the comparison of different pollination treatments. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, and MAPK signaling pathway-plant. We found many notable genes potentially involved in pollen-stigma interactions and SSI mechanisms, including genes encoding receptor-like protein kinases (RLK), calcium-related genes, disease-resistance genes, and WRKY transcription factors. Four upregulated and five downregulated DEGs were consistently identified in those comparison groups involving self-incompatible pollination, suggesting they had important roles in pollen-pistil interactions. We further identified the <i>S</i>-locus region of the <i>Corylus heterophylla</i> genome based on molecular marker location. This predicted <i>S</i>-locus contains 38 genes, of which 8 share the same functional annotation as the <i>S</i>-locus genes of <i>Corylus avellana</i>: two PIX7 homologous genes (EVM0002129 and EVM0025536), three MIK2 homologous genes (EVM0002422, EVM0005666, and EVM0009820), one aldose 1-epimerase (EVM0002095), one 3-dehydroquinate synthase II (EVM0021283), and one At3g28850 homologous gene (EVM0016149). By characterizing the pistil process during the early postpollination phase <i>via</i> transcriptomic analysis, this study provides new knowledge and lays the foundation for subsequent analyses of pollen-pistil interactions.
