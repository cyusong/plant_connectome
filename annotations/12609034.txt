['12609034', 'Arabidopsis encodes at least eight actin-related proteins (ARPs) most of which  have orthologs in other distant organisms. To gain insight into the role of ARPs  in plants, we have examined the spatial expression and subcellular distribution  of two highly divergent Arabidopsis ARPs, AtARP4 and AtARP7. AtARP4 is a homolog  of human BAF53 and yeast Arp4, and AtARP7 is a novel, ancient and plant-specific  actin-related protein that is not distinctly related to any known ARPs from other  kingdoms. Analysis of both these proteins with AtARP4- and AtARP7-specific  antibodies revealed that they were most abundant in young meristematic and floral  tissues, but were expressed constitutively in all organs and cell types  irrespective of their developmental stage. Immunofluorescence studies showed that  both AtARP4 and AtARP7 were localized predominantly to the nucleus during  interphase. In mitotic cells lacking a nuclear envelope (e.g. metaphase,  anaphase, and early telophase stages), these ARPs were excluded from the  condensed chromosomes and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, a  putative Arabidopsis histone H2B protein remained associated with the interphase  nuclei as well as chromosomes throughout the cell cycle. Based on our results and  data on the yeast ortholog of AtARP4, these two nuclear plant ARPs may be  involved in the modulation of chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation  mainly in interphase cells.', '2003 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01691.x', 'Meagher']
