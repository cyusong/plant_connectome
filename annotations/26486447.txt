['26486447', 'The Arabidopsis thaliana GLABRA2 (GL2) gene encodes a transcription factor  involved in the cell differentiation of various epidermal tissues. During root  hair pattern formation, GL2 suppresses root hair development in non-hair cells,  acting as a node between the gene regulatory networks for cell fate determination  and cell differentiation. Despite the importance of GL2 function, its molecular  basis remains obscure because the GL2 target genes leading to the network for  cell differentiation are unknown. We identified five basic helix-loop-helix  (bHLH) transcription factor genes (ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE6 [RHD6], RHD6-LIKE1  [RSL1], RSL2, Lj-RHL1-LIKE1 [LRL1], and LRL2) as GL2 direct targets using  transcriptional and posttranslational induction systems. Chromatin  immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed GL2 binding to upstream regions of these  genes in planta. Reporter gene analyses showed that these genes are expressed in  various stages of root hair development and are suppressed by GL2 in non-hair  cells. GL2 promoter-driven GFP fusions of LRL1 and LRL2, but not those of the  other bHLH proteins, conferred root hair development on non-hair cells. These  results indicate that GL2 directly suppresses bHLH genes with diverse functions  in root hair development.', '2015 Oct', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.15.00607', 'Aoyama']
