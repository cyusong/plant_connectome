Tropical forests are experiencing unprecedented high-temperature conditions due to climate change that could limit their photosynthetic functions. We studied the high-temperature sensitivity of photosynthesis in a rainforest site in southern Amazonia, where some of the highest temperatures and most rapid warming in the Tropics have been recorded. The quantum yield (F<sub>v</sub> /F<sub>m</sub> ) of photosystem II was measured in seven dominant tree species using leaf discs exposed to varying levels of heat stress. T<sub>50</sub> was calculated as the temperature at which F<sub>v</sub> /F<sub>m</sub> was half the maximum value. T<sub>5</sub> is defined as the breakpoint temperature, at which F<sub>v</sub> /F<sub>m</sub> decline was initiated. Leaf thermotolerance in the rapidly warming southern Amazonia was the highest recorded for forest tree species globally. T<sub>50</sub> and T<sub>5</sub> varied between species, with one mid-storey species, Amaioua guianensis, exhibiting particularly high T<sub>50</sub> and T<sub>5</sub> values. While the T<sub>50</sub> values of the species sampled were several degrees above the maximum air temperatures experienced in southern Amazonia, the T<sub>5</sub> values of several species are now exceeded under present-day maximum air temperatures.
