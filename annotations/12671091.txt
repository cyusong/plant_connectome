['12671091', 'The 26S proteasome is an essential protease complex responsible for removing most  short-lived intracellular proteins, especially those modified with polyubiquitin  chains. We show here that an Arabidopsis mutant expressing an altered RPN10  subunit exhibited a pleiotropic phenotype consistent with specific changes in 26S  proteasome function. rpn10-1 plants displayed reduced seed germination, growth  rate, stamen number, genetic transmission through the male gamete, and  hormone-induced cell division, which can be explained partially by a constitutive  downregulation of the key cell cycle gene CDKA;1. rpn10-1 also was more sensitive  to abscisic acid (ABA), salt, and sucrose stress and to DNA-damaging agents and  had decreased sensitivity to cytokinin and auxin. Most of the phenotypes can be  explained by a hypersensitivity to ABA, which is reflected at the molecular level  by the selective stabilization of the short-lived ABA-signaling protein ABI5.  Collectively, these results indicate that RPN10 affects a number of regulatory  processes in Arabidopsis likely by directing specific proteins to the 26S  proteasome for degradation. A particularly important role may be in regulating  the responses to signals promulgated by ABA.', '2003 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.009217', 'Vierstra']
