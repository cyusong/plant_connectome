The molecular mechanism governing the response of plants to salinity stress, one of the most significant limiting factors for agriculture worldwide, has just started to be revealed. Here, we report AtSZF1 and AtSZF2, two closely related CCCH-type zinc finger proteins, involved in salt stress responses in Arabidopsis. The expression of AtSZF1 and AtSZF2 is quickly and transiently induced by NaCl treatment. Mutants disrupted in the expression of AtSZF1 or AtSZF2 exhibit increased expression of a group of salt stress-responsive genes in response to high salt. Significantly, the atszf1-1/atszf2-1 double mutant displays more sensitive responses to salt stress than the atszf1-1 or atszf2-1 single mutants and wild-type plants. On the other hand, transgenic plants overexpressing AtSZF1 show reduced induction of salt stress-responsive genes and are more tolerant to salt stress. We also showed that AtSZF1 is localized in the nucleus. Taken together, these results demonstrated that AtSZF1 and AtSZF2 negatively regulate the expression of salt-responsive genes and play important roles in modulating the tolerance of Arabidopsis plants to salt stress.
