Volatile compounds play important roles in rhizosphere biological communications and interactions. The emission of plant and microbial volatiles is a dynamic phenomenon that is affected by several endogenous and exogenous signals. Diffusion of volatiles can be limited by their adsorption, degradation, and dissolution under specific environmental conditions. Therefore, rhizosphere volatiles need to be investigated on a micro and spatiotemporal scale. Plant and microbial volatiles can expand and specialize the rhizobacterial niche not only by improving the root system architecture such that it serves as a nutrient-rich shelter, but also by inhibiting or promoting the growth, chemotaxis, survival, and robustness of neighboring organisms. Root volatiles play an important role in engineering the belowground microbiome by shaping the microbial community structure and recruiting beneficial microbes. Microbial volatiles are appropriate candidates for improving plant growth and health during environmental challenges and climate change. However, some technical and experimental challenges limit the non-destructive monitoring of volatile emissions in the rhizosphere in real-time. In this review, we attempt to clarify the volatile-mediated intra- and inter-kingdom communications in the rhizosphere, and propose improvements in experimental design for future research.
