In Arabidopsis, the floral meristem is essential for the production of floral organs. The floral meristem is initially maintained to contribute cells for floral organ formation. However, this stem cell activity needs be completely terminated at a certain floral developmental stage to ensure the proper development of floral reproductive organs. Here, we have reviewed recent findings on the complex regulation of floral meristem activities, which involve signaling cascades, transcriptional regulation, epigenetic mechanisms and hormonal control for floral meristem determinacy in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.

Signaling cascades: !regulate! floral meristem activity 
Transcriptional regulation: !controls! floral meristem determinacy 
Epigenetic mechanisms: !influence! floral meristem activity 
Hormonal control: !affects! floral meristem determinacy
