The perception and response of pollen tubes to the female guidance signals are crucial for directional pollen tube growth inside female tissues, which leads to successful reproduction. In pursuing the mechanisms underlying this biological process, we identified the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) abnormal pollen tube guidance1 (aptg1) mutant, whose pollen tubes showed compromised micropylar guidance. In addition to its male defect, the aptg1 mutant showed embryo lethality. APTG1 encodes a putative mannosyltransferase homolog to human PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL GLYCAN ANCHOR BIOSYNTHESIS B and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL10 (GPI10), both of which are involved in the biosynthesis of GPI anchors. We found that APTG1 was expressed in most plant tissues, including mature pollen, pollen tubes, mature embryo sacs, and developing embryos. By fluorescence colabeling, we showed that APTG1 was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where GPI anchors are synthesized. Disruption of APTG1 affected the localization of COBRA-LIKE10, a GPI-anchored protein important for pollen tube growth and guidance. The results shown here demonstrate that APTG1 is involved in both vegetative and reproductive development in Arabidopsis, likely through processing and proper targeting of GPI-anchored proteins.
