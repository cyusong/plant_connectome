The rice variety 'Swarna' is highly popular in the eastern region of India. The farmers of eastern India cultivate mainly rainfed rice and face the adverse effects of climate change very frequently. Rice production in this region is not stable. Swarna variety is highly susceptible to bacterial blight (BB) disease and flash floods, which cause a heavy reduction in the yield. Transfer of five target genes/QTLs was targeted into the variety, Swarna by adopting marker-assisted backcross breeding approach. Direct markers for <i>Sub1A, OsSPL14</i>, and <i>SCM2</i> QTLs and closely linked markers for <i>xa5</i> and <i>Xa21</i> BB resistance genes were screened in the backcross progenies. Swarna-Sub1, CR Dhan 800, and Swarna-Habataki near-isogenic lines (NILs) were used as donor parents in the breeding program. True multiple F<sub>1</sub> plants were identified for backcrossing, and 796 BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub> seeds were generated. Foreground selection detected all the five target genes in six progenies in BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub> generation. The progeny containing all the target genes and more similar with the recipient parent was backcrossed, and a total of 446 BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub> seeds were produced. Foreground screening detected four BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub> plants carrying the five target genes. A total of 2,145 BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> seeds were obtained from the best BC<sub>2</sub>F<sub>1</sub> progeny. Screening of the progenies resulted in one plant with all five desirable genes, three plants with four, and another three progenies carrying three genes in homozygous conditions. The pyramided lines showed higher BB resistance and submergence tolerance than the recipient parent, Swarna. Culm strength of the pyramided lines showed higher breaking force than the recipient parent, Swarna. The pyramided line, SSBY-16-68-69 yielded the highest grain yield of 7.52 t/ha followed by the lines SSBY-16-68-511 (7.34 t/ha) and SSBY-16-68-1633 (7.02 t/ha). The best-pyramided line showed a yield advantage of 18% over the recipient parent and 6.8% over the yield component donor parent. Seven pyramided lines showed higher yield than the recipient parent, while five lines were better yielders than the yield component donor parent. The pyramided line SSBY-16-68-69 produced 365 grains/panicle, while the recipient had 152. The main morphologic and grain quality features of the recipient parent were retained in the pyramided lines.
