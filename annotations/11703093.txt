['11703093', 'Recently we identified novel plant Ser/Thr phosphatases, termed PP7, which belong  to the PPP family and have no known close homologs in other kingdoms. We now  addressed the intracellular location of Arabidopsis thaliana PP7 using GFP  fusions and confocal laser scanning microscopy. PP7. GFP fusion was expressed  transiently or stably in Nicotiana benthamiana. PP7. GFP was found to be a  predominantly nuclear protein. Effects of cytoskeleton-disrupting drugs indicate  that cytoskeleton may be required for efficient PP7. GFP delivery to the nucleus.  Deletion of a potential nuclear localization signal in the first insert in the  catalytic domain, as well as exposure to the dark, cold, high salinity and  abscisic acid failed to prevent nuclear localization of PP7. GFP. Deletion of the  44 C-terminal amino acids resulted in a fusion protein located exclusively in the  cytoplasm. The results suggest a possible similarity of the nuclear targeting  signals in PP7 and the PP5/PPT subfamily.', '2001 Nov', 'Mol Cell Biol Res Commun', '10.1006/mcbr.2001.0302', 'Kutuzov']
