Recent advances in biotechnology have helped increase tissue transformation efficiency and the frequency and specificity of gene editing to an extent that introducing allelic variants directly in elite varieties has become possible. In comparison to the conventional approach of crossing an elite recipient line with an exotic donor parent to introduce the trait of interest followed by repeated backcrossing, direct introduction of major-effect allelic variants into elite varieties saves time and resources, and eliminates yield drag resulting from the residual donor genes at the end of backcrossing.
