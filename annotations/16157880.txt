['16157880', 'Degradation of the most abundant membrane protein on earth, the light-harvesting  complex of Photosystem II (LHC II), is highly regulated under various  environmental conditions, e.g., light stress, to prevent photochemical damage to  the reaction center. We identified the LHC II degrading protease in Arabidopsis  thaliana as a Zn(2+)-dependent metalloprotease, activated by the removal of  unknown extrinsic factors, similar to the proteolytic activity directed against  Lhcb3 in barley. By using a reversed genetic approach, the chloroplast-targeted  protease FtsH6 was identified as being responsible for the degradation. T-DNA KO  A. thaliana mutants, lacking ftsH6, were unable to degrade either Lhcb3 during  dark-induced senescence or Lhcb1 and Lhcb3 during highlight acclimation. The A.  thaliana ftsH6 gene has a clear orthologue in the genome of Populus trichocarpa.  It is likely that FtsH6 is a general LHC II protease and that FtsH6-dependent LHC  II proteolysis is a feature of all higher plants.', '2005 Sep 20', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0503472102', 'Funk']
