['15063185', 'The development of trichomes and root hairs in Arabidopsis provide useful models  for the study of cell fate determination in plants. A common network of putative  transcriptional regulators, including the small MYB proteins TRIPTYCHON (TRY) and  CAPRICE (CPC), is known to influence the patterning of both cell types. Here, we  used an activation tagging strategy to identify a new regulator, ENHANCER OF TRY  AND CPC 1 (ETC1). The ETC1 sequence is similar to TRY and CPC, and ETC1  overexpression causes a reduction in trichome formation and excessive root hair  production. The etc1 single mutant has no significant phenotype, but it enhances  the effect of cpc and try on trichome and root hair development, which shows that  ETC1 function is partially redundant with TRY and CPC. In addition, the etc1 try  cpc triple mutant has novel phenotypes, revealing previously unrecognized roles  for these regulators in epidermis development. An ETC1 promoter-reporter gene  fusion is expressed in the developing trichome and non-hair cells, similar to the  expression of TRY and CPC. These results suggest that ETC1, TRY, and CPC act in  concert to repress the trichome cell fate in the shoot epidermis and the non-hair  cell fate in the root epidermis.', '2004 Apr 15', 'Dev Biol', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2003.12.037', 'Schiefelbein']
