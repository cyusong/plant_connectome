['23192225', 'In plants, the trans-Golgi network and early endosomes (TGN/EE) function as the  central junction for major endomembrane trafficking events, including endocytosis  and secretion. Here, we demonstrate that the KEEP ON GOING (KEG) protein of  Arabidopsis thaliana localizes to the TGN/EE and plays an essential role in  multiple intracellular trafficking processes. Loss-of-function keg mutants  exhibited severe defects in cell expansion, which correlated with defects in  vacuole morphology. Confocal microscopy revealed that KEG is required for  targeting of plasma membrane proteins to the vacuole. This targeting process  appeared to be blocked at the step of multivesicular body (MVB) fusion with the  vacuolar membrane as the MVB-associated small GTPase ARA6 was also blocked in  vacuolar delivery. In addition, loss of KEG function blocked secretion of  apoplastic defense proteins, indicating that KEG plays a role in plant immunity.  Significantly, KEG was degraded specifically in cells infected by the fungus  Golovinomyces cichoracearum, suggesting that this pathogen may target KEG to  manipulate the host secretory system as a virulence strategy. Taking these  results together, we conclude that KEG is a key component of TGN/EE that  regulates multiple post-Golgi trafficking events in plants, including vacuole  biogenesis, targeting of membrane-associated proteins to the vacuole, and  secretion of apoplastic proteins.', '2012 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.112.105254', 'Innes']
