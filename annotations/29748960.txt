Blue light triggers the opening of stomata in the morning to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and water loss through transpiration. During the day, plants may experience periodic drought and accumulate abscisic acid (ABA). ABA antagonizes blue light signalling through phosphatidic acid and reduces stomatal aperture. This study reveals a molecular mechanism by which two light signalling proteins interact to repress ABA signalling in the control of stomatal aperture. A hypersensitive to red and blue 2 (hrb2) mutant has a defective ATP-dependent chromatin-remodelling factor, PKL, in the chromodomain/helicase/DNA binding family. HRB2 enhances the light-induced expression of a B-box transcription factor gene, BBX21. BBX21 binds a T/G box in the ABI5 promoter and recruits HRB2 to modulate the chromatin structure at the ABI5 locus. Mutation in either HRB2 or BBX21 led to reduced water loss and ABA hypersensitivity. This hypersensitivity to ABA was well explained by the enhanced expression of the ABA signalling gene ABI5 in both mutants. Indeed, stomatal aperture was significantly reduced by ABI5 overexpression in the absence or presence of ABA under monochromatic light conditions. Overall, we present a regulatory loop in which two light signalling proteins repress ABA signalling to sustain gas exchange when plants experience periodic drought.
