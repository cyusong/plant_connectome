['25182467', 'One week after partial incision of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems, the repair  process in damaged tissue includes pith cell proliferation. Auxin is a key factor  driving this process, and ANAC071, a transcription factor gene, is upregulated in  the distal region of the incised stem. Here we show that XTH20 and the closely  related XTH19, members of xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases family  catalyzing molecular grafting and/or hydrolysis of cell wall xyloglucans, were  also upregulated in the distal part of the incised stem, similar to ANAC071.  XTH19 was expressed in the proximal incision region after 3 days or after auxin  application to the decapitated stem. Horizontal positioning of the plant with the  incised side up resulted in decreased ProDR 5 :GUS, ANAC071, XTH20, and XTH19  expression and reduced pith cell proliferation. In incised stems of Pro35S  :ANAC071-SRDX plants, expression of XTH20 and XTH19 was substantially and  moderately decreased, respectively. XTH20 and XTH19 expression and pith cell  proliferation were suppressed in anac071 plants and were increased in Pro35S  :ANAC071 plants. Pith cell proliferation was also inhibited in the xth20xth19  double mutant. Furthermore, ANAC071 bound to the XTH20 and XTH19 promoters to  induce their expression. This study revealed XTH20 and XTH19 induction by auxin  via ANAC071 in the distal part of an incised stem and their involvement in cell  proliferation in the tissue reunion process.', '2014 Nov', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12654', 'Satoh']
