Etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, lacking a functional prephenate dehydratase1 gene (PD1), also lack the ability to synthesize phenylalanine (Phe) and, as a consequence, phenylpropanoid pigments. We find that low doses of ultraviolet (UV)-C (254 nm) are lethal and low doses of UV-B cause severe damage to etiolated pd1 mutants, but not to wild-type (wt) seedlings. Furthermore, exposure to UV-C is lethal to etiolated gcr1 (encoding a putative G protein-coupled receptor in Arabidopsis) mutants and gpa1 (encoding the sole G protein alpha subunit in Arabidopsis) mutants. Addition of Phe to growth media restores wt levels of UV resistance to pd1 mutants. The data indicate that the Arabidopsis G protein-signalling pathway is critical to providing protection from UV, and does so via the activation of PD1, resulting in the synthesis of Phe. Cotyledons of etiolated pd1 mutants have proplastids (compared with etioplasts in wt), less cuticular wax and fewer long-chain fatty acids. Phe-derived pigments do not collect in the epidermal cells of pd1 mutants when seedlings are treated with UV, particularly at the cotyledon tip. Addition of Phe to the growth media restores a wt phenotype to pd1 mutants.
