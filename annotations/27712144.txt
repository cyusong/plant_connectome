The RNA-binding chaperone Hfq plays critical roles in the establishment and functionality of the symbiosis between Sinorhizobium meliloti and its legume hosts. A mutation in hfq reduces symbiotic efficiency resulting in a Fix<sup>-</sup> phenotype, characterized by the inability of the bacterium to fix nitrogen. At least in part, this is due to the ability of Hfq to regulate the fixLJ operon, which encodes a sensor kinase-response regulator pair that controls expression of the nitrogenase genes. The ability of Hfq to bind fixLJ in vitro and in planta was demonstrated with gel shift and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Two (ARN)<sub>2</sub> motifs in the fixLJ message were the likely sites through which Hfq exerted its posttranscriptional control. Consistent with the regulatory effects of Hfq, downstream genes controlled by FixLJ (such as nifK, noeB) were also subject to Hfq regulation in planta.
