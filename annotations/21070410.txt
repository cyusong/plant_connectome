['21070410', 'Transcriptome analysis using the Affymetrix ATH1 platform has been completed on  purified trichomes from the gl3-sst mutant. These trichomes display immature  features, such as glassy cell walls and blunted branches. The gl3-sst trichome  transcriptome was greatly enriched for genes involved in lipid biosynthesis,  including those mediating the synthesis of fatty acids and wax. In addition,  gl3-sst trichomes displayed reduced expression of the R3 MYBs TRY and CPC, which  normally function to limit trichome development. The expression of the MIXTA-like  MYB gene NOK was elevated. Members of the MIXTA-like family promote conical cell  outgrowth, and in some cases, trichome initiation in diverse plant species. In  contrast, NOK limits trichome outgrowth in wild-type Arabidopsis plants. Similar  to other MIXTA-like genes, NOK was required for the expansion of gl3-sst  trichomes, as the gl3-sst nok double mutant trichomes were greatly reduced in  size. Expression of NOK in nok mutants reduced branch formation, whereas in  gl3-sst nok, NOK expression promoted trichome cell outgrowth, illustrating duel  roles for NOK in both promoting and limiting trichome development. MIXTA-like  genes from phylogenetically diverse plant species could substitute for NOK in  both nok and gl3-sst nok backgrounds. These findings suggest that certain aspects  of NOK and MIXTA-like gene function have been conserved.', '2010 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04329.x', 'Marks']
