Under saline conditions, an optimal cell water balance, possibly mediated by aquaporins, is important to maintain the whole-plant water status. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of boric acid in the soil solution can be observed in saline soils. In this work, the interaction between salinity and excess boron with respect to the root hydraulic conductance (L(0)), abundance of aquaporins (ZmPIP1 and ZmPIP2), ATPase activity and root sap nutrient content, in the highly boron- and salt-tolerant Zea mays L. cv. amylacea, was evaluated. A downregulation of root ZmPIP1 and ZmPIP2 aquaporin contents were observed in NaCl-treated plants in agreement with the L(0) measurements. However, in the H3BO3-treated plants differences in the ZmPIP1 and ZmPIP2 abundance were observed. The ATPase activity was related directly to the amount of ATPase protein and Na+ concentration in the roots, for which an increase in NaCl- and H3BO3+ NaCl-treated plants was observed with respect to untreated and H3BO3-treated plants. Although nutrient imbalance may result from the effect of salinity or H3BO3 alone, an ameliorative effect was observed when both treatments were applied together. In conclusion, our results suggest that under salt stress, the activity of specific membrane components can be influenced directly by boric acid, regulating the functions of certain aquaporin isoforms and ATPase as possible components of the salinity tolerance mechanism.
