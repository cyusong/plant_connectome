Humans are currently facing the problem of how to ensure that there is enough food to feed all of the world's population. Ensuring that the food supply is sufficient will likely require the modification of crop genomes to improve their agronomic traits. The development of engineered sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) paved the way for targeted gene editing in organisms, including plants. SSNs generate a double-strand break (DSB) at the target DNA site in a sequence-specific manner. These DSBs are predominantly repaired via error-prone non-homologous end joining and are only rarely repaired via error-free homology-directed repair if an appropriate donor template is provided. Gene targeting (GT), i.e. the integration or replacement of a particular sequence, can be achieved with combinations of SSNs and repair donor templates. Although its efficiency is extremely low, GT has been achieved in some higher plants. Here, we provide an overview of SSN-facilitated GT in higher plants and discuss the potential of GT as a powerful tool for generating crop plants with desirable features.

SSN: !generates! DSB 
DSB: !repaired by! non-homologous end joining 
non-homologous end joining: !rarely repaired by! homology-directed repair 
homology-directed repair: !achieves! gene targeting 
gene targeting: !generates! crop plants with desirable features
