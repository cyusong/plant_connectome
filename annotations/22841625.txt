MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein coding regulatory RNAs released after the cleavage of a primary transcript. A computational homology search of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available in public databases allowed the identification of 20 conserved miRNAs belonging to 13 different families in flax (Linum usitatissimum). Most of the miRNAs were 21 nucleotides-long and carried a uracil at the 5' end. They originated from precursor transcripts that vary greatly in length. A single precursor containing 2 different stem-loop structures, each one carrying a member of the miR398 family, was identified for the first time in plants. qRT-PCR analyses of 4 selected miRNAs indicated that all were differentially expressed in flax tissues. The 20 miRNAs could potentially regulate 112 different targets including genes involved in cell wall metabolism. Analyses of pri-miRNA and potential gene expression profiles in a publically available microarray data set allowed the identification of a number of highly opposite pri-miRNA/target gene profiles potentially involved in regulating plantacyanin levels, F-box mediated signalling processes, protein metabolism and ion homeostasis, as well as 6 unknown processes.
