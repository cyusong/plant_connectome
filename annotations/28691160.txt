The diverse pigmentation patterns of flower corollas probably result from pollinator-mediated selection. Previous studies demonstrated that R2R3-MYB factors may have been recruited in the regulation of corolla pigmentation. However, how R2R3-MYBs became so diverse in their regulation of different pigmentation patterns remains unclear. Here, we studied a Lamiales species, Torenia fournieri, which has elaborate zygomorphic flowers with dorsal-ventral asymmetries in corolla pigmentation. We found recent gene duplication events in CYCLOIDEA-like (CYC-like) and RADIALIS-like (RAD-like) genes, and functionally analyzed three dorsal-specific expression factors: TfCYC1, TfCYC2, and TfRAD1. We found that the CYC-RAD module coordinates petal shape and corolla pigmentation, as ectopic expression of TfCYC2 or TfRAD1 disrupted the asymmetric corolla pigmentation pattern and produced strongly dorsalized flowers. Dorsal petal identity was lost when TfCYC2 was down-regulated or when TfRAD1 was knocked out. In T. fournieri, the diversified CYC and RAD genes have evolved regulatory loops, and TfCYC2 binds directly to the regulatory regions of an R2R3-MYB factor gene, TfMYB1, which might lead to its asymmetric expression and ultimately establish the asymmetric pigmentation pattern. These findings support the existence of a regulatory module that integrates dorsal-ventral patterning and asymmetric corolla pigmentation in T. fournieri.
