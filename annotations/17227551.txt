['17227551', 'We have developed a novel gain-of-function system that we have named the FOX  hunting system (Full-length cDNA Over-eXpressing gene hunting system). We used  normalized full-length cDNA and introduced each cDNA into Arabidopsis by in  planta transformation. About 10 000 independent full-length Arabidopsis cDNAs  were expressed independently under the CaMV 35S promoter in Arabidopsis. Each  transgenic Arabidopsis contained on average 2.6 cDNA clones and was monitored  under various categories such as morphological changes, fertility and leaf color.  We found 1487 possible morphological mutants from 15 547 transformants. When 115  pale green T(1) mutants were analyzed, 59 lines represented the mutant phenotypes  in more than 50% of the T(2) progeny. Characterization of two leaf color mutants  revealed the significance of this approach. We also document mutants from several  categories and their corresponding full-length cDNAs.', '2006 Dec', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02924.x', 'Matsui']
