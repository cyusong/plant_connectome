Mature Nicotiana benthamiana shows stable resistance to the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Induction of phytoalexin (capsidiol) production is essential for the resistance, which is upregulated via a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (NbMEK2-WIPK/SIPK) followed by ethylene signaling. In this study, NbNup75 (encodes a nuclear pore protein Nucleoporin75) was identified as an essential gene for resistance of N. benthamiana to P. infestans. In NbNup75-silenced plants, initial events of elicitor-induced responses such as phosphorylation of MAPK and expression of defense-related genes were not affected, whereas induction of later defense responses such as capsidiol production and cell death induction was suppressed or delayed. Ethylene production induced by either INF1 or NbMEK2 was reduced in NbNup75-silenced plants, whereas the expression of NbEAS (a gene for capsidiol biosynthesis) induced by ethylene was not affected, indicating that Nup75 is required for the induction of ethylene production but not for ethylene signaling. Given that nuclear accumulation of polyA RNA was increased in NbNup75-silenced plants, efficient export of mRNA from nuclei via nuclear pores would be important for the timely upregulation of defense responses. Collectively, Nup75 is involved in the induction of a later stage of defense responses, including the ethylene-mediated production of phytoalexin for the resistance of N. benthamiana to P. infestans.
