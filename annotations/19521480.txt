Exocytosis molecular mechanisms in plant cells are not fully understood. The full characterization of molecular determinants, such as SNAREs, for the specificity in vesicles delivery to the plasma membrane should shed some light on these mechanisms. Nicotiana tabacum Syntaxin 1 (NtSyr1 or SYP121) is a SNARE protein required for ABA control of ion channels and appears involved in the exocytosis of exogenous markers.NtSyr1 is mainly localized on the plasma membrane, but when over expressed the protein also appears on endomembranes. Since NtSyr1 is a tail-anchored protein inserted into the target membrane post-translationally, it is not clear whether its initial anchoring site is the ER or the plasma membrane.In this study, we investigated the sorting events of NtSyr1 in vivo using its full-length cDNA or its C-terminal domain, fused to a GFP tag and transiently expressed in protoplasts or in the leaves of Nicotiana tabacum cv. SR1. Five chimeras were produced of which two were useful to investigate the protein sorting within the endomembrane system. One (GFP-H3M) had a dominant negative effect on exocytosis; the other one (SP1-GFP) resulted in a slow targeting to the same localization of the full-length chimera (GFP-SP1). The insertion of signal peptides on SP1-GFP further characterized the insertion site for this protein. Our data indicates that NtSyr1 is firstly anchored on ER membrane and then sorted to plasma membrane.
