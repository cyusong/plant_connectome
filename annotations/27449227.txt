Deployment of the root system is highly sensitive to the levels and spatial distribution of nutrients like nitrogen. However, the genetic determinants of these sensing and deployment mechanisms are still poorly understood. Previously, using system approaches based on temporal changes in root transcriptome in relation to low nitrogen (LN), we have been able to identify a module that activates root production in poplar in response to LN conditions. Here, using comparative, gene ontology and expression analyses, we provide further evidence that the genes in this module are indeed involved in regulation of root development under LN. Better understanding of these modules will enable approaches for breeding for better nitrogen use efficiency through development of a more sensitive and plastic root system.

Nitrogen: !affects! Root system deployment
Genes: !regulate! Root development under low nitrogen conditions
