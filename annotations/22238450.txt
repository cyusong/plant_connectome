I selected my favourite image from a paper by Professor Friedrich Laibach, the founder of Arabidopsis research. His paper from 1951 is the first paper dealing with natural variation for flowering time in this species, a topic many scientists including myself, have followed up and has resulted in large steps forward in our understanding of flowering time regulation. How this topic came to be of interest in my laboratory in Wageningen is described in this short overview.
