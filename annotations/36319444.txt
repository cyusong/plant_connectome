Boron (B) is a required micronutrient that is crucial for the growth and development of vascular plants. A deficiency in B is generally regarded as a limiting factor affecting agricultural production in many parts of the world. Boron is involved in the metabolism of plant lignin and additionally, B deficiency can lead to the excessive accumulation of lignin in plant leaves/roots, resulting in corking symptoms and inhibited growth. However, the effect of B on lignin biosynthesis is not as well characterized as the specific function of B in the cell wall. In this article, recent studies on the regulation of lignin biosynthesis in plants under low-B stress conditions are reviewed. Moreover, the following possible mechanisms underlying the lignin synthesis promoted by B deficiency are discussed: (1) the accumulation of phenolic substances during B deficiency directly enhances lignin synthesis; (2) excess H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> has a dual function to the enhancement of lignin under boron deficiency conditions, serving as a substrate and a signaling molecule; and (3) B deficiency regulates lignin synthesis through the expression of genes encoding transcription factors such as MYBs. Finally, future studies regarding physiology, molecules, and transcriptional regulation may reveal the mechanism(s) mediating the relationship between lignin synthesis and B deficiency. This review provides new insights and important references for future research and the enhancement of plant B nutrition.
