Soil salinity affects various aspects of plant growth and development including flowering. Usually, plants show a delayed flowering phenotype under high salinity conditions, whereas some plants will risk their life to continue to grow, thereby escaping serious salt stress to achieve reproductive success. However, the molecular mechanisms of the escape strategies are not clear yet. In this work, we report that the transcription factor WRKY71 helps escape salt stress in Arabidopsis. The expression of the WRKY71 wild-type (WT) allele was salinity inducible. Compared with Col-0, high salt stress caused only a marginal delay in the flowering time of the activation-tagged mutant WRKY71-1D. However, flowering in the RNA interference (RNAi)-based multiple WRKY knock-out mutant (w71w8 + 28RNAi) was dramatically later than in the WT under high salinity conditions. Meanwhile, expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and LEAFY (LFY) was greater in WRKY71-1D than in the WT, and lower in w71w8 + 28RNAi under salinity-stressed conditions. The suggestion is that WRKY71 activity hastens flowering, thereby providing a means for the plant to complete its life cycle in the presence of salt stress.
