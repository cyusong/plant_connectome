Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase (PEPc) catalyzes the first committed step of C4 photosynthesis generating oxaloacetate from bicarbonate (HCO3-) and PEP. It is hypothesized that PEPc affinity for HCO3- has undergone selective pressure for a lower KHCO3 (Km for HCO3-) to increase the carbon flux entering the C4 cycle, particularly during conditions that limit CO2 availability. However, the decrease in KHCO3 has been hypothesized to cause an unavoidable increase in KPEP (Km for PEP). Therefore, the amino acid residue S774 in the C4 enzyme, which has been shown to increase KPEP, should lead to a decrease in KHCO3. Several studies reported the effect S774 has on KPEP; however, the influence of this amino acid substitution on KHCO3 has not been tested. To test these hypotheses, membrane-inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) was used to measure the KHCO3 of the photosynthetic PEPc from the C4Flaveria trinervia and the non-photosynthetic PEPc from the C3F. pringlei. The cDNAs for these enzymes were overexpressed and purified from the PEPc-less PCR1 Escherichia coli strain. Our work in comparison with previous reports suggests that KHCO3 and KPEP are linked by specific amino acids, such as S774; however, these kinetic parameters respond differently to the tested allosteric regulators, malate and glucose-6-phosphate.
