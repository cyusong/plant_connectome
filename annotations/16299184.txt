Sugar-induced anthocyanin accumulation has been observed in many plant species. We observed that sucrose (Suc) is the most effective inducer of anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings. Other sugars and osmotic controls are either less effective or ineffective. Analysis of Suc-induced anthocyanin accumulation in 43 Arabidopsis accessions shows that considerable natural variation exists for this trait. The Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) accession essentially does not respond to Suc, whereas Landsberg erecta is an intermediate responder. The existing Landsberg erecta/Cvi recombinant inbred line population was used in a quantitative trait loci analysis for Suc-induced anthocyanin accumulation (SIAA). A total of four quantitative trait loci for SIAA were identified in this way. The locus with the largest contribution to the trait, SIAA1, was fine mapped and using a candidate gene approach, it was shown that the MYB75/PAP1 gene encodes SIAA1. Genetic complementation studies and analysis of a laboratory-generated knockout mutation in this gene confirmed this conclusion. Suc, in a concentration-dependent way, induces MYB75/PAP1 mRNA accumulation. Moreover, MYB75/PAP1 is essential for the Suc-mediated expression of the dihydroflavonol reductase gene. The SIAA1 locus in Cvi probably is a weak or loss-of-function MYB75/PAP1 allele. The C24 accession similarly shows a very weak response to Suc-induced anthocyanin accumulation encoded by the same locus. Sequence analysis showed that the Cvi and C24 accessions harbor mutations both inside and downstream of the DNA-binding domain of the MYB75/PAP1 protein, which most likely result in loss of activity.

Suc: !induces! MYB75/PAP1 mRNA
MYB75/PAP1: !encodes! SIAA1
Cvi: !harbors! weak/loss-of-function MYB75/PAP1 allele
C24: !harbors! mutations in DNA-binding domain of MYB75/PAP1
