Two novel nuclear genes, OsSIG5 and OsSIG6, encoding potential plastid sigma factors of RNA polymerase (RNAP) were identified in Oryza sativa. The deduced amino acid sequences contain conserved regions, regions 1.2-4.2, and a novel region A/B at the N-terminus. Tissue-specific and light-responsive transcripts of OsSIG5 and OsSIG6 were observed. The N-terminal region of OsSig5 conferred import of green fluorescent protein into the chloroplast. Specific transcripts of rice psbA were synthesized in vitro by reconstituted OsSig5-RNAP holoenzymes. These results indicated that OsSig5 is a plastid sigma factor. This is the first report of the Sig5-type sigma factor in crops.
