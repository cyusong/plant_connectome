The regeneration and stability of the NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR, EC 1.3.1.33) enzyme complexes were studied in bleached epicotyls of 9-day-old dark-germinated pea (Pisum sativum L. cv. Zsuzsi) seedlings. Middle segments were illuminated with 1300 micromol m(-2) s(-1) photon flux density (PFD) white light and subsequently incubated in total darkness for 4-24 h at 24 degrees C. Almost the full amount of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) was degraded after 60 min illumination. The preferential regeneration of the 655 nm emitting Pchlide form was observed after 4 h dark incubation; the accumulation of the short-wavelength Pchlide form-dominating in epicotyls of dark-grown seedling-required 18-24 h dark. The Pchlide content of bleached samples was around 2.5% of that of the etiolated samples; after 4 h of dark incubation this value increased to 4-7%. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot showed that the amount of the POR protein decreased to about 50% during bleaching; after 4 h regeneration it reached almost the same level as that of dark-grown samples. We concluded that much more POR protein compared with Pchlide pigment remained stable during bleaching and the non-destroyed POR units were able to form preferentially oligomers during the dark-regeneration which could collect de novo synthesized Pchlide into 655 nm emitting complexes. These data indicate the high stability of the POR protein in pea epicotyls and the importance of the molecular environment in stimulating the aggregation of POR units.
