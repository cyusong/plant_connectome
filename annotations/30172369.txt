['30172369', 'Wound-induced polypeptides (WIPs) are a novel class of polypeptides with the  length less than 100 amino acids. Our previous research has identified a number  of WIP genes in soybean (Glycine max) root nodules. However, functions of WIPs in  planta remains largely unknown. Here, we identified five WIP-encoding genes,  AtWIP1-5, in Arabidopsis. Among them, AtWIP1 and -2 are ubiquitously expressed in  a partially overlapping pattern as revealed by both qRT-PCR and promoter:GUS  assays. Subcellular localization analyses reveal that both AtWIP1 and -2 are  localized at the plasma membrane while AtWIP1 shows a punctate distribution  pattern. AtWIP1, -2 are transcriptionally induced by flg22 treatment, but  repressed by effector(s) of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000).  Heterologous overexpression of GmWIP genes enhances resistance of Arabidopsis to  Pst DC3000 at the cost of growth inhibition. Moreover, overexpression of GmWIP  genes promotes pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) evidenced by increased  expressions of flg22-inducible genes and enhanced seedling growth inhibition  under flg22 treatment. Taken together, our results indicate that WIPs positively  regulate plant resistance against Pst DC3000 by enhancing PTI responses.', '2018 Sep 26', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.08.147', 'Luo']
