['16214903', 'The synergid cells of the female gametophyte play a role in many steps of the  angiosperm fertilization process, including guidance of pollen tube growth to the  female gametophyte. However, the mechanisms by which the synergid cells become  specified and develop their unique features during female gametophyte development  are not understood. We identified MYB98 in a screen for Arabidopsis thaliana  genes expressed in the female gametophyte. MYB98 is a member of the R2R3-MYB gene  family, the members of which likely encode transcription factors. In the context  of the ovule, MYB98 is expressed exclusively in the synergid cells, and mutations  in this gene affect the female gametophyte specifically. myb98 female  gametophytes are affected in two unique features of the synergid cell, pollen  tube guidance and the filiform apparatus, but are otherwise normal. MYB98 also is  expressed in trichomes and endosperm. Homozygous myb98 mutants exhibit no  sporophytic defects, including trichome and endosperm defects. Together, these  data suggest that MYB98 controls the development of specific features within the  synergid cell during female gametophyte development.', '2005 Nov', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.034603', 'Drews']
