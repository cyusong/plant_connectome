Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450) participate in the catalytic conversion of biological compounds in a plethora of metabolic pathways, such as the biosynthesis of alkaloids, terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and hormones in plants. Plants utilize these metabolites for growth and defense against biotic and abiotic stress. In this study, we identified 346 P450 (GmP450) enzymes encoded by 317 genes in soybean where 26 <i>GmP450</i> genes produced splice variants. The genome-wide comparison of both A-type and non-A-type GmP450s for their motifs composition, gene structure, tissue-specific expression, and their chromosomal distribution were determined. Even though conserved P450 signature motifs were found in all GmP450 families, larger variation within a specific motif was observed in the non-A-type GmP450s as compared with the A-type. Here, we report that the length of variable region between two conserved motifs is exact in the members of the same family in majority of the A-type GmP450. Analyses of the transcriptomic datasets from soybean-<i>Phytophthora sojae</i> interaction studies, quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with <i>P. sojae</i> resistance, and co-expression analysis identified some GmP450s that may be, in part, play an important role in partial resistance against <i>P. sojae.</i> The findings of our CYPome study provides novel insights into the functions of GmP450s and their involvements in metabolic pathways in soybean. Further experiments will elucidate their roles in general and legume-specific function.
