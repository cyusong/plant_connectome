Amino acid concentration and composition in xylem and phloem sap and in plant tissues are good markers of plant performance and general plant nitrogen (N)-supply. Here, we tested if amino acid pools in Eucalyptus regnans, growing in southeastern Australia were increased by understory acacias in 70-yr-old stands, and if xylem N-transport of temperate Acacia spp. differs from their tropical counterparts. We analysed amino-N concentrations and composition in foliage, xylem and phloem. In a novel approach we coupled amino-N concentrations of xylem with long-term sap flow measurements to calculate total stand N-transport. Xylem N-transport of E. regnans is largely based on amino compounds of the glutamate group (more than 90%). By contrast, Acacia spp. transport mainly aspartate group amino acids in xylem (up to 80%). Amino compound diversity and concentration in tissues and xylem and phloem sap were universally greater in acacias compared to eucalypts. Acacias investigated here can be classified as 'amide transporters'. We conclude that N-status and growth potential of aging E. regnans forest is not enhanced by a contribution of N from understory acacias, and that xylem N-transport in temperate Acacia spp. differs from acacias located in the tropics.

E. regnans: !transports! Glutamate group amino acids
Acacia spp.: !transports! Aspartate group amino acids
E. regnans: !has lower! Amino compound diversity and concentration
Acacia spp.: !has higher! Amino compound diversity and concentration
