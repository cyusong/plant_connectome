Seedling emergence in monocots depends mainly on mesocotyl elongation, requiring coordination between developmental signals and environmental stimuli. Strigolactones (SLs) and karrikins are butenolide compounds that regulate various developmental processes; both are able to negatively regulate rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) mesocotyl elongation in the dark. Here, we report that a karrikin signaling complex, DWARF14-LIKE (D14L)-DWARF3 (D3)-<i>O. sativa</i> SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (OsSMAX1) mediates the regulation of rice mesocotyl elongation in the dark. We demonstrate that D14L recognizes the karrikin signal and recruits the SCF<sup>D3</sup> ubiquitin ligase for the ubiquitination and degradation of OsSMAX1, mirroring the SL-induced and D14- and D3-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of D53. Overexpression of <i>OsSMAX1</i> promoted mesocotyl elongation in the dark, whereas knockout of <i>OsSMAX1</i> suppressed the elongated-mesocotyl phenotypes of <i>d14l</i> and <i>d3</i> OsSMAX1 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINs, regulating downstream gene expression. Moreover, we showed that the GR24 enantiomers GR24<sup>5DS</sup> and GR24 <sup><i>ent-</i>5DS</sup> specifically inhibit mesocotyl elongation and regulate downstream gene expression in a D14- and D14L-dependent manner, respectively. Our work revealed that karrikin and SL signaling play parallel and additive roles in modulating downstream gene expression and negatively regulating mesocotyl elongation in the dark.
