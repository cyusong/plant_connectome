['19395683', 'The specification of cell fates during development requires precise regulatory  mechanisms to ensure robust cell type patterns. Theoretical models of pattern  formation suggest that a combination of negative and positive feedback mechanisms  are necessary for efficient specification of distinct fates in a field of  differentiating cells. Here, we examine the role of the R2R3-MYB transcription  factor gene, AtMYB23 (MYB23), in the establishment of the root epidermal cell  type pattern in Arabidopsis thaliana. MYB23 is closely related to, and is  positively regulated by, the WEREWOLF (WER) MYB gene during root epidermis  development. Furthermore, MYB23 is able to substitute for the function of WER and  to induce its own expression when controlled by WER regulatory sequences. We also  show that the MYB23 protein binds to its own promoter, suggesting a MYB23  positive feedback loop. The localization of MYB23 transcripts and MYB23-green  fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein, as well as the effect of a chimeric  MYB23-SRDX repressor construct, links MYB23 function to the developing non-hair  cell type. Using mutational analyses, we find that MYB23 is necessary for precise  establishment of the root epidermal pattern, particularly under conditions that  compromise the cell specification process. These results suggest that MYB23  participates in a positive feedback loop to reinforce cell fate decisions and  ensure robust establishment of the cell type pattern in the Arabidopsis root  epidermis.', '2009 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.063180', 'Schiefelbein']
