Root hairs are tubular outgrowths specifically differentiated from epidermal cells in a differentiation zone. The formation of root hairs greatly increases the surface area of a root and maximizes its ability to absorb water and inorganic nutrients essential for plant growth and development. Root hair development is strictly regulated by intracellular and intercellular signal communications. Cell surface-localized receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) have been shown to be important components in these cellular processes. In this review, the functions of a number of key RLKs in regulating Arabidopsis root hair development are discussed, especially those involved in root epidermal cell fate determination and root hair tip growth.

RLK: !regulates! Root hair development
RLK: !determines! Root epidermal cell fate
RLK: !controls! Root hair tip growth
