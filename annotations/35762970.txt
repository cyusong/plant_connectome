Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important crops worldwide. Heading date is a vital agronomic trait that influences rice yield and adaption to local conditions. Hd3a, a proposed florigen that primarily functions under short-day (SD) conditions, is a mobile flowering signal that promotes the floral transition in rice. Nonetheless, how Hd3a is transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) under SDs remains elusive. Here, we report that FT-INTERACTING PROTEIN9 (OsFTIP9) specifically regulates rice flowering time under SDs by facilitating Hd3a transport from companion cells (CCs) to sieve elements (SEs). Furthermore, we show that the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein OsTPR075 interacts with both OsFTIP9 and OsFTIP1 and strengthens their respective interactions with Hd3a and the florigen RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (RFT1). This in turn affects the trafficking of Hd3a and RFT1 to the SAM, thus regulating flowering time under SDs and long-day conditions, respectively. Our findings suggest that florigen transport in rice is mediated by different OsFTIPs under different photoperiods and those interactions between OsTPR075 and OsFTIPs are essential for mediating florigen movement from leaves to the SAM.
