In an alternative pathway to acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)-mediated triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis from diacylglycerol, phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT) utilizes not acyl-CoA but an acyl group from sn-2 position of a phospholipid, to form TAG. The enzyme's activity <i>in vitro</i> matches DGAT's in a number of plant species, however its main function in plants (especially in vegetative tissue) is debatable. In the presented study, we cultivated <i>PDAT1</i>-overexpressing, <i>pdat1</i> knockout and wild-type lines of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> through their whole lifecycle. <i>PDAT1</i> overexpression prolonged Arabidopsis lifespan in comparison to wild-type plants, whereas knocking out <i>pdat1</i> accelerated the plant's senescence. After subjecting the 3-week old seedlings of the studied lines (grown <i>in vitro</i>) to 2-h heat stress (40°C) and then growing them for one more week in standard conditions, the difference in weight between wild-type and <i>PDAT</i>1-overexpressing lines increased in comparison to the difference between plants grown only in optimal conditions. In another experiment all lines exposed to 2-week cold stress experienced loss of pigment, except for <i>PDAT</i>1-overexpressing lines, which green rosettes additionally weighed 4 times more than wild-type. Our results indicate that plants depleted of <i>PDAT1</i> are more susceptible to cold exposure, while <i>PDAT1</i> overexpression grants plants a certain heat and cold resilience. Since it was shown, that lysophospholipids may be intertwined with stress response, we decided to also conduct <i>in vitro</i> assays of acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) and acylCoA:lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase (LPEAT) activity in microsomal fractions from the <i>PDAT1</i>-overexpressing Arabidopsis lines in standard conditions. The results show significant increase in LPEAT and LPCAT activity in comparison to wild-type plants. <i>PDAT1</i>-overexpressing lines' rosettes also present twice as high expression of <i>LPCAT2</i> in comparison to control. The presented study shows how much heightened expression of <i>PDAT1</i> augments plant condition after stress and extends its lifespan.
