Fluorescence-based protein-protein interaction techniques are vital tools for understanding in vivo cellular functions on a mechanistic level. However, only under the condition of highly efficient (co)transformation and accumulation can techniques such as Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) realize their potential for providing highly accurate and quantitative interaction data. FRET as a fluorescence-based method unifies several advantages, such as measuring in an in vivo environment, real-time context, and the ability to include transient interactions as well as detecting the mere proximity of proteins. Here, we introduce a novel vector set that incorporates the benefit of the recombination-based 2in1 cloning system with the latest state-of-the-art fluorescent proteins for optimal coaccumulation and FRET output studies. We demonstrate its utility across a range of methods. Merging the 2in1 cloning system with new-generation FRET fluorophore pairs allows for enhanced detection, speeds up the preparation of clones, and enables colocalization studies and the identification of meaningful protein-protein interactions in vivo.
