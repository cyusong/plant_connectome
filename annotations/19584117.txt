Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) is viewed as a versatile scaffold protein in mammals. The protein sequence of RACK1 is highly conserved in eukaryotes. However, the function of RACK1 in plants remains poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggested that RACK1 may be involved in hormone responses, but the precise role of RACK1 in any hormone signalling pathway remains elusive. Molecular and genetic evidence that Arabidopsis RACK1 is a negative regulator of ABA responses is provided here. It is shown that three RACK1 genes act redundantly to regulate ABA responses in seed germination, cotyledon greening and root growth, because rack1a single and double mutants are hypersensitive to ABA in each of these processes. On the other hand, plants overexpressing RACK1A displayed ABA insensitivity. Consistent with their proposed roles in seed germination and early seedling development, all three RACK1 genes were expressed in imbibed, germinating and germinated seeds. It was found that the ABA-responsive marker genes, RD29B and RAB18, were up-regulated in rack1a mutants. Furthermore, the expression of all three RACK1 genes themselves was down-regulated by ABA. Consistent with the view that RACK1 negatively regulates ABA responses, rack1a mutants lose water significantly more slowly from the rosettes and are hypersensitive to high concentrations of NaCl during seed germination. In addition, the expression of some putative RACK1-interacting, ABA-, or abiotic stress-regulated genes was mis-regulated in rack1a rack1b double mutants in response to ABA. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence that RACK1 is a critical, negative regulator of ABA responses.
