['19876748', 'The ROF2 (FKBP65) is a heat stress protein which belongs to the FK506 Binding  Protein (FKBP) family. It is homologous to ROF1 (FKBP62) which was recently shown  to be involved in long term acquired thermotolerance by its interaction with  HSP90.1 and modulation of the heat shock transcription factor HsfA2. In this  study, we have demonstrated that ROF2 participates in long term acquired  thermolerance, its mode of action being different from ROF1. In the absence of  ROF2, the small heat shock proteins were highly expressed and the plants were  resistant to heat stress, opposite to the effect observed in the absence of ROF1.  It was further demonstrated that ROF2 transcription is modulated by HsfA2 which  is also essential for keeping high levels of ROF2 during recovery from heat  stress. ROF2 localization to the nucleus was observed several hours after heat  stress exposure and its translocation to the nucleus was independent from the  presence of HSP90.1 or HsfA2. ROF2 has been shown to interact with ROF1, to form  heterodimers and it is suggested that via this interaction it can join the  complex ROF1-HSP90.1- HsfA2. Transient expression of ROF2 together with ROF1  repressed transcription of small HSPs. A model describing the mode of action of  ROF2 as a heat stress modulator which functions in negative feedback regulation  of HsfA2 is proposed.', '2010 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-009-9561-3', 'Breiman']
