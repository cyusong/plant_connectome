The photoreceptors of red light (phytochromes) and blue light (cryptochromes) impact plant growth and metabolism. However, their action has been barely studied, especially in coniferous plants. Therefore, the influence of blue (maximum 450 nm), red (maximum 660 nm), white light (maxima 450 nm + 575 nm), far-red light (maximum 730 nm), white fluorescent light and dark on seed germination, growth, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, as well as the transcript levels of genes involved in reception, photosynthesis, light and hormonal signaling of Scots pine plantlets, was investigated. The highest values of dry weight, root length and photosynthetic pigment contents were characteristic of 9-day-old plantlets grown under red light, whereas in the dark plantlet length, seed vigor, seed germination, dry weight and pigment contents were decreased. Under blue and white lights, the main studied morphological parameters were decreased or close to red light. The cotyledons were undeveloped under dark conditions, likely due to the reduced content of photosynthetic pigments, which agrees with the low transcript levels of genes encoding protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (<i>PORA</i>) and phytoene synthase (<i>PSY</i>). The transcript levels of a number of genes involved in phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling, such as <i>GA3ox</i>, <i>RRa</i>, <i>KAO</i> and <i>JazA</i>, were enhanced under red light, unlike under dark conditions. We suggest that the observed phenomena of red light are the most important for the germination of the plantlets and may be based on earlier and enhanced expression of auxin, cytokinin, gibberellin and jasmonate signaling genes activated by corresponding photoreceptors. The obtained results may help to improve reforestation technology; however, this problem needs further study.
