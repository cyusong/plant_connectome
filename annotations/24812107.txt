Plant immunity is activated through complex and cross-talking transduction pathways that include a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation cascade. Here, we have investigated the role in immunity of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene subfamily that encodes the mitogen-activated protein triple kinases indicated as ARABIDOPSIS NUCLEUS- AND PHRAGMOPLAST-LOCALIZED KINASE1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE1 (ANP1), ANP2, and ANP3. For this study, we used representative danger signals (elicitors) belonging to the classes of the damage- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, i.e. oligogalacturonides, linear fragments derived from the plant cell wall homogalacturonan, and the peptide elf18 derived from the bacterial elongation factor thermo-unstable. Analyses of single and double as well as conditional triple mutants show that ANPs are required for elicitor-triggered defense responses and protection against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. Notably, ANPs are also required for both the elicitor-induced oxidative burst and the transduction of the hydrogen peroxide signal but not for the inhibition of auxin-induced gene expression, indicating that this response can be uncoupled from the activation of defense responses. Our findings point to ANPs as key transduction elements that coordinate damage- and pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and orchestrate reactive oxygen species accumulation and signaling.
