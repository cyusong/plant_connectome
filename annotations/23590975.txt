['23590975', 'Plants make coenzyme A (CoA) in the cytoplasm but use it for reactions in  mitochondria, chloroplasts, and peroxisomes, implying that these organelles have  CoA transporters. A plant peroxisomal CoA transporter is already known, but plant  mitochondrial or chloroplastic CoA transporters are not. Mitochondrial CoA  transporters belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family, however, have been  identified in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Leu-5p) and mammals (SLC25A42).  Comparative genomic analysis indicated that angiosperms have two distinct  homologs of these mitochondrial CoA transporters, whereas nonflowering plants  have only one. The homologs from maize (Zea mays; GRMZM2G161299 and  GRMZM2G420119) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; At1g14560 and At4g26180)  all complemented the growth defect of the yeast leu5Delta mitochondrial CoA carrier  mutant and substantially restored its mitochondrial CoA level, confirming that  these proteins have CoA transport activity. Dual-import assays with purified pea  (Pisum sativum) mitochondria and chloroplasts, and subcellular localization of  green fluorescent protein fusions in transiently transformed tobacco (Nicotiana  tabacum) Bright Yellow-2 cells, showed that the maize and Arabidopsis proteins  are targeted to mitochondria. Consistent with the ubiquitous importance of CoA,  the maize and Arabidopsis mitochondrial CoA transporter genes are expressed at  similar levels throughout the plant. These data show that representatives of both  monocotyledons and eudicotyledons have twin, mitochondrially located  mitochondrial carrier family carriers for CoA. The highly conserved nature of  these carriers makes possible their reliable annotation in other angiosperm  genomes.', '2013 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.218081', 'Hanson']
