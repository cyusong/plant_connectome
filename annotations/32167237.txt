Trehalose plays important roles in plant growth and stress responses and is synthesized from trehalose-6-phosphate by trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). Here, we show that trehalose and abscisic acid (ABA) have synergistic effects on root growth and stomatal closure. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains ten genes encoding TPPs and the expression level of one, TPPE, and trehalose contents increased in response to ABA. In the presence of ABA, the ABA-responsive transcription factor ABA RESPONSE ELEMENT BINDING FACTOR2 (ABF2) directly binds to the TPPE promoter to activate its expression. Genetic analysis revealed that TPPE acts downstream of ABF2, which is supported by the findings that TPPE expression and trehalose content are reduced in the abf2 mutant and that a mutation in TPPE abolished the ABA-sensitive root elongation phenotype of 35S:ABF2 plants. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in response to ABA failed to occur in tppe mutant plants, suggesting that TPPE is involved in ABA-controlled root elongation and stomatal movement by inducing ROS accumulation. This study uncovers a new branch of the ABA signaling pathway and provides a molecular basis for the role of trehalose in plant responses to abiotic stress.
