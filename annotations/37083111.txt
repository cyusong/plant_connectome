Zinc (Zn) is an important element in plants, but over-accumulation of Zn is harmful. The phytohormone brassinosteroids (BRs) play a key role in regulating plant growth, development, and response to stress. However, the role of BRs in watermelon (<i>Citrullus lanatus</i> L.) under Zn stress, one of the most important horticultural crops, remains largely unknown. In this study, we revealed that 24-epibrassinolide (EBR), a bioactive BR enhanced Zn tolerance in watermelon plants, which was related to the EBR-induced increase in the fresh weight, chlorophyll content, and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and decrease in the content of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), malondialdehyde (MDA), and Zn in watermelon leaves. Through RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq), 350 different expressed genes (DEG) were found to be involved in the response to Zn stress after EBR treatment, including 175 up-regulated DEGs and 175 down-regulated DEGs. The up-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in 'phenylpropanoid biosynthesis' pathway (map00940) using KEGG enrichment analysis. The gene expression levels of <i>PAL</i>, <i>4CL</i>, <i>CCR</i>, and <i>CCoAOMT</i>, key genes involved in phenylpropanoid pathway, were significantly induced after EBR treatment. In addition, compared with Zn stress alone, EBR treatment significantly promoted the activities of PAL, 4CL, and POD by 30.90%, 20.69%, and 47.28%, respectively, and increased the content of total phenolic compounds, total flavonoids, and lignin by 23.02%, 40.37%, and 29.26%, respectively. The present research indicates that EBR plays an active role in strengthening Zn tolerance, thus providing new insights into the mechanism of BRs enhancing heavy metal tolerance.
