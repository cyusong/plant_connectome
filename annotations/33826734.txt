Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential element for plant growth and is utilized by several key enzymes in biological redox processes. Rice assimilates molybdate ions via OsMOT1;1, a transporter with a high affinity for molybdate. However, other systems involved in the molecular transport of molybdate in rice remain unclear. Here, we characterized OsMOT1;2, which shares amino acid sequence similarity with AtMOT1;2 and functions in vacuolar molybdate export. We isolated a rice mutant harboring a complete deletion of OsMOT1;2. This mutant exhibited a significantly lower grain Mo concentration than the wild type (WT), but its growth was not inhibited. The Mo concentration in grains was restored by the introduction of WT OsMOT1;2. The OsMOT1;2-GFP protein was localized to the vacuolar membrane when transiently expressed in rice protoplasts. At the reproductive growth stage of the WT plant, OsMOT1;2 was highly expressed in the 2nd and lower leaf blades and nodes. The deletion of OsMOT1;2 impaired interorgan Mo allocation in aerial parts: relative to the WT, the mutant exhibited decreased Mo levels in the 1st and 2nd leaf blades and grains but increased Mo levels in the 2nd and lower leaf sheaths, nodes and internodes. When the seedlings were exposed to a solution with a high KNO3 concentration in the absence of Mo, the mutant exhibited significantly lower nitrate reductase activity in the shoots than the WT. Our results suggest that OsMOT1;2 plays an essential role in interorgan Mo distribution and molybdoenzyme activity in rice.
