The vast majority of flowering plants rely solely on insects for pollination. A number of pathogens have evolved mechanisms to exploit these close associations and use pollinators as vectors of infective propagules. Factors that affect pollinator movements and successful pollination may in turn also influence successful transmission of fungal spores. Here we investigate the effect of host density and the frequency of diseased Oxalis lanata individuals infected by the anther-smut fungus, Thecaphora capensis, on the likelihood of receiving pollen and fungal spores. Specifically, we determined the numbers of spores and pollen grains deposited on stigmatic surfaces of selected flowers under natural and standardized conditions where host density and disease frequency varied. The effect of host flower density and diseased flower frequency on pollen and spore transfer was variable under natural conditions and these factors interacted significantly. However, an increase in host density and disease frequency significantly influenced pollen and spore deposits under standardized conditions. The effect of host density was, however, not linear and an optimal flower density for pollen and fungal spore transmission was found. Similar to other systems of vector-borne disease, the transmission of anther-smut of Oxalis lanata is more frequency-dependent than density-dependent. This study represents a first step towards understanding the disease transmission process of T. capensis on Oxalis and lays the foundation for future comparative studies between this and other systems to develop and test general hypotheses of disease dynamics in vector-borne disease transmission systems.
