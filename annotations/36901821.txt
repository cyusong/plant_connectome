Regeneration refers to the process by which organisms repair and replace lost tissues and organs. Regeneration is widespread in plants and animals; however, the regeneration capabilities of different species vary greatly. Stem cells form the basis for animal and plant regeneration. The essential developmental processes of animals and plants involve totipotent stem cells (fertilized eggs), which develop into pluripotent stem cells and unipotent stem cells. Stem cells and their metabolites are widely used in agriculture, animal husbandry, environmental protection, and regenerative medicine. In this review, we discuss the similarities and differences in animal and plant tissue regeneration, as well as the signaling pathways and key genes involved in the regulation of regeneration, to provide ideas for practical applications in agriculture and human organ regeneration and to expand the application of regeneration technology in the future.
