MAIN CONCLUSION : A RhoA-derived peptide fused to carrier molecules from plants showed enhanced biological activity of in vitro assays against respiratory syncytial virus compared to the RhoA peptide alone or the synthetic RhoA peptide. A RhoA-derived peptide has been reported for over a decade as a potential inhibitor of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection both in vitro and in vivo and is anticipated to be a promising alternative to monoclonal antibody-based therapy against RSV infection. However, there are several challenges to furthering development of this antiviral peptide, including improvement in the peptide’s bioavailability, development of an efficient delivery system and identification of a cost-effective production platform. In this study, we have engineered a RhoA peptide as a genetic fusion to two carrier molecules, either lichenase (LicKM) or the coat protein (CP) of Alfalfa mosaic virus. These constructs were introduced into Nicotiana benthamiana plants using a tobacco mosaic virus-based expression vector and targets purified. The results demonstrated that the RhoA peptide fusion proteins were efficiently expressed in N. benthamiana plants, and that two of the resulting fusion proteins, RhoA-LicKM and RhoA2-FL-d25CP, inhibited RSV growth in vitro by 50 and 80 %, respectively. These data indicate the feasibility of transient expression of this biologically active antiviral RhoA peptide in plants and the advantage of using a carrier molecule to enhance target expression and efficacy.
