Improved soybean cultivars have been adapted to grow at a wide range of latitudes, enabling expansion of cultivation worldwide. However, the genetic basis of this broad adaptation is still not clear. Here, we report the identification of GmPRR3b as a major flowering time regulatory gene that has been selected during domestication and genetic improvement for geographic expansion. Through a genome-wide association study of a diverse soybean landrace panel consisting of 279 accessions, we identified 16 candidate quantitative loci associated with flowering time and maturity time. The strongest signal resides in the known flowering gene E2, verifying the effectiveness of our approach. We detected strong signals associated with both flowering and maturity time in a genomic region containing GmPRR3b. Haplotype analysis revealed that GmPRR3b<sup>H6</sup> is the major form of GmPRR3b that has been utilized during recent breeding of modern cultivars. mRNA profiling analysis showed that GmPRR3b<sup>H6</sup> displays rhythmic and photoperiod-dependent expression and is preferentially induced under long-day conditions. Overexpression of GmPRR3b<sup>H6</sup> increased main stem node number and yield, while knockout of GmPRR3b<sup>H6</sup> using CRISPR/Cas9 technology delayed growth and the floral transition. GmPRR3b<sup>H6</sup> appears to act as a transcriptional repressor of multiple predicted circadian clock genes, including GmCCA1a, which directly upregulates J/GmELF3a to modulate flowering time. The causal SNP (Chr12:5520945) likely endows GmPRR3b<sup>H6</sup> a moderate but appropriate level of activity, leading to early flowering and vigorous growth traits preferentially selected during broad adaptation of landraces and improvement of cultivars.
