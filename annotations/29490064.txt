['29490064', 'Regulation of protein function by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is an  important mechanism in many cellular events. The phototropin blue-light  photoreceptors, plant-specific AGCVIII kinases, are essential for phototropic  responses. Members of the D6 PROTEIN KINASE (D6PK) family, representing a  subfamily of the AGCVIII kinases, also contribute to phototropic responses,  suggesting that possibly further AGCVIII kinases may potentially control  phototropism. The present study investigates the functional roles of Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) AGCVIII kinases in hypocotyl phototropism. We demonstrate  that D6PK family kinases are not only required for the second but also for the  first positive phototropism. In addition, we find that a previously  uncharacterized AGCVIII protein, AGC1-12, is involved in the first positive  phototropism and gravitropism. AGC1-12 phosphorylates serine residues in the  cytoplasmic loop of PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) and shares phosphosite preferences with  D6PK. Our work strongly suggests that the D6PK family and AGC1-12 are critical  components for both hypocotyl phototropism and gravitropism, and that these  kinases control tropic responses mainly through regulation of PIN-mediated auxin  transport by protein phosphorylation.', '2018 May 1', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcy048', 'Sakai']
