Although light is essential for photosynthesis, excess light can damage the photosynthetic apparatus and deregulate other cellular processes. Thus, protective integrated regulatory responses that can dissipate excess of absorbed light energy and simultaneously optimize photosynthesis and other cellular processes under variable light conditions can prove highly adaptive. Here, we show that the local and systemic responses to an excess light episode are associated with photoelectrophysiological signaling (PEPS) as well as with changes in nonphotochemical quenching and reactive oxygen species levels. During an excess light incident, PEPS is induced by quantum redox changes in photosystem II and in its proximity and/or by changes in glutathione metabolism in chloroplasts. PEPS is transduced, at least in part, by bundle sheath cells and is light wavelength specific. PEPS systemic propagation speed and action potential are dependent on ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE2 function. Excess light episodes are physiologically memorized in leaves, and the cellular light memory effect is specific for an excess of blue (450 nm) and red (650 nm) light of similar energy. It is concluded that plants possess a complex and dynamic light training and memory system that involves quantum redox, reactive oxygen species, hormonal, and PEPS signaling and is used to optimize light acclimation and immune defenses.
