We have identified new potential regulators of xylem cell-type determination and cellular proliferation in cassava and studied their expression in roots. Results are highly relevant for cassava biotechnology. Cassava's root system is composed of two types of root that coexist in every individual: the fibrous and the storage roots. Whether a root becomes fibrous or storage depends on the xylem cell types that it develops: fibrous roots develop xylem fibres and vessels while storage roots develop parenchyma xylem, the starch-storing tissue. A crucial question in cassava root development is how the specific xylem cell types differentiate and proliferate in the fibrous and storage roots. Using phylogenetic, protein sequence and synteny analyses we identified (1) MeVND6, MeVND7.1, MeVND7.2, MeNST3.1 and MeNST3.2 as the potential cassava orthologues of the Arabidopsis regulators of xylem cell type determination AtVND6, AtVND7 and AtNST3; and (2) MeWOX4.1 and MeWOX4.2 as the potential cassava orthologues of the Arabidopsis cambium regulator AtWOX4. Fibrous and storage roots were anatomically characterised and tested for the expression of the identified genes. Results revealed that (1) MeVND7.1 and MeVND7.2 are expressed in the fibrous but not in the storage roots; (2) MeVND6 shows low expression in both root types; (3) MeNST3.1 is not expressed in the fibrous or storage roots, while MeNST3.2 is highly expressed in both root-types and (4) MeWOX4.1 and, to a higher level, MeWOX4.2 are expressed in both the fibrous and storage roots. Results open new avenues for research in cassava root development and for food security-oriented biotechnology programmes.
