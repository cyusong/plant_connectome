Fusarium head blight (FHB) causes significant grain yield and quality reductions in wheat and barley. Most wheat varieties are incapable of preventing FHB spread through the rachis, but disease is typically limited to individually infected spikelets in barley. We point-inoculated wheat lines possessing barley chromosome introgressions to test whether FHB resistance could be observed in a wheat genetic background. The most striking differential was between 4H(4D) substitution and 4H addition lines. The 4H addition line was similarly susceptible to the wheat parent, but the 4H(4D) substitution line was highly resistant, which suggests that there is an FHB susceptibility factor on wheat chromosome 4D. Point inoculation of Chinese Spring 4D ditelosomic lines demonstrated that removing 4DS results in high FHB resistance. We genotyped four Chinese Spring 4DS terminal deletion lines to better characterize the deletions in each line. FHB phenotyping indicated that lines del4DS-2 and del4DS-4, containing smaller deletions, were susceptible and had retained the susceptibility factor. Lines del4DS-3 and del4DS-1 contain larger deletions and were both significantly more resistant, and hence had presumably lost the susceptibility factor. Combining the genotyping and phenotyping results allowed us to refine the susceptibility factor to a 31.7 Mbp interval on 4DS.
