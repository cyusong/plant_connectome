['9085581', 'Cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-diacylglycerol synthase (cytidine  triphosphate:phosphatidate cytihyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.41) catalyzes the  formation of CDP-diacylglycerol, which is the precursor of phosphatidylinositol,  phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin. We report the first cloning, to our  knowledge, of two plant cDNAs, StCDS1 and AtCDS1, coding for CDP-diacylglycerol  synthase from potato (Solanum tuberosum) and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively.  The two proteins belong to the eukaryotic type of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase and  contain eight predicted transmembrane-spanning domains. We analyzed gene  expression in shoot and root tissues of potato plants and demonstrated enzyme  activity by expression of N-terminally truncated, recombinant StCDS1 in  Escherichia coli.', '1997 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.113.3.997', 'Muller-Rober']
