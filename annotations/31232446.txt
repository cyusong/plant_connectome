Pyrabactin resistance 1 (PYR1)/PYR1-like (PYL) abscisic acid (ABA) receptors have been proved to be recruited in the plasma membrane (PM). In order to explain the roles of PYR/PYLs in the PM, PYL4 was used as bait to screen the PM-localized leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase family, and five members were found directly interacting with PYL4. Loss of function by T-DNA insertion in C-terminally encoded peptide receptor 2 (CEPR2) together with phloem intercalated with xylem (PXY) and PXY-Like 2 (PXL2) led to ABA hypersensitivity, while CEPR2 overexpression led to ABA insensitivity compared with the wild type, indicating the redundant and negative roles of CEPR2, PXY, and PXL2 in ABA signaling. The PYL4 proteins were strongly accumulated in cepr2/pxy/pxl2 compared with the wild type. Furthermore, higher phosphorylation levels accompanied by lower protein levels of PYL4 in CEPR2 overexpression lines were observed, indicating the requirement of phosphorylation of PYLs for degradation. Subsequently, MS and in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that CEPR2 phosphorylated PYL4 at Ser54, while this phosphorylation was diminished or even eliminated in the presence of ABA. Taken together, CEPR2 promotes the phosphorylation and degradation of PYLs in unstressed conditions, whereas ABA represses this process to initiate ABA response during times of stress.
