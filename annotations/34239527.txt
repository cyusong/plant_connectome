Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the two predominant mineral elements, which are not only essential for plant growth and development in general but also play a key role in symbiotic N fixation in legumes. Legume plants have evolved complex signaling networks to respond to both external and internal levels of these macronutrients to optimize symbiotic N fixation in nodules. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup>) are the two major forms of P and N elements utilized by plants, respectively. Pi starvation and NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> application both reduce symbiotic N fixation <i>via</i> similar changes in the nodule gene expression and invoke local and long-distance, systemic responses, of which N-compound feedback regulation of rhizobial nitrogenase activity appears to operate under both conditions. Most of the N and P signaling and transport processes have been investigated in model organisms, such as <i>Medicago truncatula</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Oryza sativa</i>, etc. We attempted to discuss some of these processes wherever appropriate, to serve as references for a better understanding of the N and P signaling and transport during symbiosis.
