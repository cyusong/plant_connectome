In bacteria, FtsZ proteins form a Z ring that is the initial step preceding septal fission. FtsZ proteins enable the division of mitochondria in early eukaryotes and are present in some kingdoms but have been lost in animals, fungi, and plants. Here, we have identified two <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> ortholog genes of <i>Escherichia coli</i> FtsZs, designated <i>PcFtsZ</i>1 and <i>PcFtsZ</i>2. Overexpression of <i>PcFtsZ</i>2 in <i>E. coli</i> fully complemented the overexpression phenotype of <i>EcFtsZ</i>. In contrast, overexpression of <i>PcFtsZ</i>1 in <i>E. coli</i> had minimal impact on cell division and separation. Thus, we focused on evaluating the impact of altered expression of <i>PcFtsZ</i>2 in <i>P. capsici</i>, as it exhibited the strongest phenotype. <i>PcFtsZ</i>2 was expressed at the highest levels in mycelia, sporangia, and germinating cysts, as well as in late infection. <i>PcFtsZ</i>2 mis-expression lines showed aberrant asexual growth and development of <i>P. capsici</i>. Alterations in the expression of <i>PcFtsZ</i>2 changed the distribution of mitochondria in hyphae and sporangia and, also, affected the number, size, and shape of actin plaques. Silencing of <i>PcFtsZ</i>2 restrained growth and development of invasive structures, especially cysts and sporangia, substantially inhibiting the ability of transformants to cause blight lesions. In overexpressed transformant lines, cyst and sporangial germination rates were only half that of controls, but hyphal growth from direct germination of sporangia was more rapid than controls. These transformant lines were only slightly impaired in virulence relative to controls. This study emphasizes the essential role of the evolutionarily conserved FtsZ2 proteins in affecting cytoskeleton dynamics.
