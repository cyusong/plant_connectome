['19833761', 'Plants have developed their own defense strategies because they have no immune  cells. A common plant defense strategy involves programmed cell death (PCD) at  the infection site, but how the PCD-associated cell-autonomous immunity is  executed in plants is not fully understood. Here we provide a novel mechanism  underlying cell-autonomous immunity, which involves the fusion of membranes of a  large central vacuole with the plasma membrane, resulting in the discharge of  vacuolar antibacterial proteins to the outside of the cells, where bacteria  proliferate. The extracellular fluid that was discharged from the vacuoles of  infected leaves had both antibacterial activity and cell death-inducing activity.  We found that a defect in proteasome function abolished the membrane fusion  associated with both disease resistance and PCD in response to avirulent  bacterial strains but not to a virulent strain. Furthermore, RNAi plants with a  defective proteasome subunit PBA1 have reduced DEVDase activity, which is an  activity associated with caspase-3, one of the executors of animal apoptosis. The  plant counterpart of caspase-3 has not yet been identified. Our results suggest  that PBA1 acts as a plant caspase-3-like enzyme. Thus, this novel defense  strategy through proteasome-regulating membrane fusion of the vacuolar and plasma  membranes provides plants with a mechanism for attacking intercellular bacterial  pathogens.', '2009 Nov 1', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1825209', 'Hara-Nishimura']
