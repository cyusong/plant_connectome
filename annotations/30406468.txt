Picea wilsonii transcription factor PwNAC2 enhanced plant tolerance to salt and drought stress through multiple signaling pathway and interacted with PwRFCP1 to participate in flowering regulation. NAC is one of the largest transcription factor families in plants, however, its role is not yet fully understood. Here, we identified a transcription factor PwNAC2 in Picea wilsonii, which localized in nucleus with transcriptional activity in C-terminal region and can form homodimer by itself. Expression analysis by real-time PCR showed that PwNAC2 was induced by multiple abiotic stresses and phytohormones stimuli. PwRFCP1 (Resemble-FCA-contain-PAT1 domain), an interaction protein of PwNAC2 was screened via yeast two hybrid. Luciferase complementation assay confirmed the interaction in vivo and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay showed the interaction in nucleus. PwNAC2 overexpression retarded Arabidopsis hypocotyls growth which is closely related to light, whereas promotion of hypocotyls growth by PwRFCP1 is independent on light. Under drought or salt treatment, overexpression of PwNAC2 in Arabidopsis showed more vigorous seed germination and significant tolerance for seedlings by ROS scavenging, reducing of membrane damage, slower water loss and increased stomatal closure. ABA or CBF-pathway marker genes were substantially higher in PwNAC2 transgenic Arabidopsis. Overexpression of PwRFCP1 promotes flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis, whereas PwNAC2 delayed flowering by altering the expression of FT, SOC1 and FLC. In addtioin, PwRFCP1 overexpression plants showed no higher tolerance to stress treatment than Col-0. Collectively, our results indicate that PwNAC2 enhanced plant tolerance to abiotic stress through multiple signaling pathways and participated in PwRFCP1-regulated flowering time.
