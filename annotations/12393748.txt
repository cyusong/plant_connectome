['12393748', "Using a specific recombination assay, we show in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana  that AtRad1 protein plays a role in the removal of non-homologous tails in  homologous recombination. Recombination in the presence of non-homologous  overhangs is reduced 11-fold in the atrad1 mutant compared with the wild-type  plants. AtRad1p is the A. thaliana homologue of the human Xpf and Saccharomyces  cerevisiae Rad1 proteins. Rad1p is a subunit of the Rad1p/Rad10p  structure-specific endonuclease that acts in nucleotide excision repair and  inter-strand crosslink repair. This endonuclease also plays a role in mitotic  recombination to remove non-homologous, 3'-ended overhangs from recombination  intermediates. The Arabidopsis atrad1 mutant (uvh1), unlike rad1 mutants known  from other eukaryotes, is hypersensitive to ionizing radiation. This last  observation may indicate a more important role for the Rad1/Rad10 endonuclease in  recombination in plants. This is the first direct demonstration of the  involvement of AtRad1p in homologous recombination in plants.", '2002 Nov', 'EMBO Rep', '10.1093/embo-reports/kvf211', 'White']
