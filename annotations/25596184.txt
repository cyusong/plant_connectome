['25596184', 'The extension of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) for the synthesis of  specialized apoplastic lipids requires unique biochemical machinery. Condensing  enzymes catalyze the first reaction in fatty acid elongation and determine the  chain length of fatty acids accepted and produced by the fatty acid elongation  complex. Although necessary for the elongation of all VLCFAs, known condensing  enzymes cannot efficiently synthesize VLCFAs longer than 28 carbons, despite the  prevalence of C28 to C34 acyl lipids in cuticular wax and the pollen coat. The  eceriferum2 (cer2) mutant of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was previously  shown to have a specific deficiency in cuticular waxes longer than 28 carbons,  and heterologous expression of CER2 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)  demonstrated that it can modify the acyl chain length produced by a condensing  enzyme from 28 to 30 carbon atoms. Here, we report the physiological functions  and biochemical specificities of the CER2 homologs CER2-LIKE1 and CER2-LIKE2 by  mutant analysis and heterologous expression in yeast. We demonstrate that all  three CER2-LIKEs function with the same small subset of condensing enzymes, and  that they have different effects on the substrate specificity of the same  condensing enzyme. Finally, we show that the changes in acyl chain length caused  by each CER2-LIKE protein are of substantial importance for cuticle formation and  pollen coat function.', '2015 Mar', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.253195', 'Joubes']
