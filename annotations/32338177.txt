Anthocyanins are considered health-promoting phytonutrients; however, anthocyanins strictly occurr in the fruit peel of purple tomato cultivars, making the total anthocyanin content limited per tomato fruit. In this study, we performed a transcriptome analysis between the fruit peel and flesh of a purple tomato cultivar 'Indigo Rose' at both the mature green stage and breaking stage. In total, 1,945 differently expressed genes, including 165 transcription factors, were detected between the fruit peel and flesh, both at and after the mature green stage. We further analyzed the transcription of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes and the regulatory genes composing the MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) complex between the fruit peel and flesh at both development stages. In addition, several light-sensing genes and other transcription factor genes, including BBX family genes and WRKY genes, showed different expression patterns between the fruit peel and flesh. These findings deepen our understanding of anthocyanin biosynthesis in tomato fruit peels and facilitate the identification of genes limiting the anthocyanin biosynthesis in tomato fruit flesh.
