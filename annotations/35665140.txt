Plants defend themselves against ecological stresses including drought. Therefore, they adopt various strategies to cope with stress, such as seepage and drought tolerance mechanisms, which allow plant development under drought conditions. There is evidence that microbes play a role in plant drought tolerance. In this study, we presented a review of the literature describing the initiation of drought tolerance mediated by plant inoculation with fungi, bacteria, viruses, and several bacterial elements, as well as the plant transduction pathways identified <i>via</i> archetypal functional or morphological annotations and contemporary "omics" technologies. Overall, microbial associations play a potential role in mediating plant protection responses to drought, which is an important factor for agricultural manufacturing systems that are affected by fluctuating climate.
