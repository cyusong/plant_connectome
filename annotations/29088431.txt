Until now, specific inhibitors of sucrose carriers were not available. This led us to study the properties of the recently synthesized D-glucose-fenpiclonil conjugate (D-GFC). This large amphiphilic glucoside exhibited an extremely low phloem systemicity in contrast to L-amino acid-fenpiclonil conjugates. Using Ricinus seedlings, the effect of D-GFC on 0.5 mM [14C]sucrose (Suc), 3-O-[3H]methylglucose, and [3H]glutamine uptake by cotyledon tissues was compared with that of p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (PCMBS). D-GFC dramatically inhibited H+-Suc symport at the same concentrations as PCMBS (0.5 and 1 mM), but in contrast to the thiol reagent, it did not affect 3-O-methylglucose and glutamine transport, nor the acidification of the incubation medium by cotyledon tissues. Similarly, 0.5 mM D-GFC inhibited active Suc uptake by Vicia faba leaf tissues and by Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with AtSUC2, a gene involved in Suc phloem loading in Arabidopsis, by approximately 80%. The data indicated that D-GFC was a potent inhibitor of Suc uptake from the endosperm and of Suc phloem loading. It is the first chemical known to exhibit such specificity, at least in Ricinus, and this property permitted the quantification of the two routes involved in phloem loading of endogenous sugars after endosperm removal.
