The transmission of mobile wound signals along the phloem pathway is essential to the activation of wound-induced systemic response/resistance, which requires an upsurge of jasmonic acid (JA) in the distal undamaged leaves. Among these mobile signals, the electrical signal mediated by the glutamate-dependent activation of several clade three GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR3) proteins is involved in the stimulation of JA production in distal leaves. However, whether JA acts as a mobile wound signal and, if so, how it is transmitted and interacts with the electrical signal remain unclear. Here, we show that JA was translocated from the local to distal leaves in Arabidopsis, and this process was predominantly regulated by two phloem-expressed and plasma membrane-localized jasmonate transporters, AtJAT3 and AtJAT4. In addition to the cooperation between AtJAT3/4 and GLR3.3 in the regulation of long-distance JA translocation, our findings indicate that importer-mediated cell-cell JA transport is important for driving the loading and translocation of JA in the phloem pathway in a self-propagating manner.
