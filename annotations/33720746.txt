The soilborne oomycete <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> is the most destructive pathogen of vegetable crops and is responsible for substantial economic losses worldwide. Here, we present an improved genome assembly of <i>P. capsici</i> generated by Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing (for de novo assembly) and Illumina short-read sequencing (for polishing). The genome of <i>P. capsici</i> is 100.5 Mb in length (GC content = 50.8%) and contains 26,069 predicted protein-coding genes. The whole genome of <i>P. capsici</i> is assembled into 194 scaffolds, 90% of which are larger than 300 kb. The N<sub>50</sub> scaffold length and maximum scaffold length are 1.0 and 4.1 Mb, respectively. The whole-genome sequence of <i>P. capsici</i> will broaden our knowledge of this pathogen and enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of its pathogenicity, which will facilitate the development of effective management strategies.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
