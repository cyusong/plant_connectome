The formation of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) at the beginning of the pathway is the rate limiting step of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and target of multiple timely and spatially organized control mechanisms. Recent discovery of a glutamyl-tRNA reductase-binding protein (GluTRBP), reveals a new insight in the topology of regulation of plant ALA biosynthesis.

GluTRBP: !binds to! glutamyl-tRNA reductase 
ALA biosynthesis: !regulated by! GluTRBP 
ALA biosynthesis: !rate-limited by! formation of 5-aminolevulinic acid
