The establishment of the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, termed the root-nodule symbiosis (RNS), requires elaborate interactions at the molecular level. The host plant-derived transcription factor NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) is known to be crucial for RNS, regulating associated processes such as alteration of root hair morphology, infection thread formation, and cell division during nodulation. This emphasizes the importance of the precise spatiotemporal regulation of <i>NIN</i> expression for the establishment of RNS; however, the detailed role of <i>NIN</i> promoter sequences in this process remains unclear. The <i>daphne</i> mutant, a <i>nin</i> mutant allele containing a chromosomal translocation approximately 7 kb upstream of the start codon, does not form nodules but does form infection threads, indicating that the region within 7 kb of the <i>NIN</i> start codon contributes to <i>NIN</i> expression during infection thread formation. CYCLOPS binds to a CYCLOPS response element (<i>CYC-RE</i>) in the <i>NIN</i> promoter, and <i>cyclops</i> mutants are defective in infection thread formation. Here, we performed complementation analysis in <i>nin</i> mutants, using various truncated forms of the <i>NIN</i> promoter, and found that the <i>CYC-RE</i> is important for infection thread formation. Additionally, the <i>CYC-RE</i> deletion mutant, generated through CRISPR/Cas9 technology, displayed a significant reduction in infection thread formation, indicating that the <i>CYC-RE</i> is important for the fine-tuning of <i>NIN</i> expression during this process. However, the fact that infection thread formation is not completely abolished in the <i>CYC-RE</i> deletion mutant suggests that <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> factors other than CYCLOPS and the <i>CYC-RE</i> may cooperatively regulate <i>NIN</i> expression for the induction of infection thread formation.
