Of the different groups of soil microorganisms, pseudomonads are one of the important class, playing various roles in the plants growth and development. Although they have been reported to inflict both beneficial and harmful effect on plants, they act through various mechanisms. Among the different mechanisms, cyanogenesis is one of the important factors used by pseudomonads to cause positive and less studied negative effects in the rhizosphere. By employing a bioassay driven approach, we dissected the direct effect of pseudomonad cyanogenesis on host plants and also its indirect effect through the inhibition of beneficial biofilm formation by B. subtilis. This study may further our understanding on the multi-tropic rhizospheric interactions mediated by rhizospheric pseudomonads.
