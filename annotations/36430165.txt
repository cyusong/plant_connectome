We used the NanoLuc luciferase bioluminescent reporter system to detect turnip yellows virus (TuYV) in infected plants. For this, TuYV was genetically tagged by replacing the C-terminal part of the RT protein with full-length NanoLuc (TuYV-NL) or with the N-terminal domain of split NanoLuc (TuYV-N65-NL). Wild-type and recombinant viruses were agro-infiltrated in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, <i>Montia perfoliata</i>, and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. ELISA confirmed systemic infection and similar accumulation of the recombinant viruses in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and <i>M. perfoliata</i> but reduced systemic infection and lower accumulation in <i>A. thaliana</i>. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the recombinant sequences were stable in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and <i>M. perfoliata</i> but not in <i>A. thaliana</i>. Bioluminescence imaging detected TuYV-NL in inoculated and systemically infected leaves. For the detection of split NanoLuc, we constructed transgenic <i>N. benthamiana</i> plants expressing the C-terminal domain of split NanoLuc. Bioluminescence imaging of these plants after agro-infiltration with TuYV-N65-NL allowed the detection of the virus in systemically infected leaves. Taken together, our results show that NanoLuc luciferase can be used to monitor infection with TuYV.
