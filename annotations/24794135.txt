Although magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) is the most abundant divalent cation in plant cells, little is known about the mechanism of Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake by plant roots. Here, we report a key function of Magnesium Transport6 (MGT6)/Mitochondrial RNA Splicing2-4 in Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake and low-Mg<sup>2+</sup> tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. MGT6 is expressed mainly in plant aerial tissues when Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels are high in the soil or growth medium. Its expression is highly induced in the roots during Mg<sup>2+</sup> deficiency, suggesting a role for MGT6 in response to the low-Mg<sup>2+</sup> status in roots. Silencing of MGT6 in transgenic plants by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in growth retardation under the low-Mg<sup>2+</sup> condition, and the phenotype was restored to normal growth after RNAi plants were transferred to Mg<sup>2+</sup>-sufficient medium. RNAi plants contained lower levels of Mg<sup>2+</sup> compared with wild-type plants under low Mg<sup>2+</sup> but not under Mg<sup>2+</sup>-sufficient conditions. Further analysis indicated that MGT6 was localized in the plasma membrane and played a key role in Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake by roots under Mg<sup>2+</sup> limitation. We conclude that MGT6 mediates Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake in roots and is required for plant adaptation to a low-Mg<sup>2+</sup> environment.
