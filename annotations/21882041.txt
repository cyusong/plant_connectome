The heterocystous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 displayed two superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, namely FeSOD and MnSOD. Prolonged exposure of Anabaena PCC7120 cells to methyl viologen mediated oxidative stress resulted in loss of both SOD activities and induced cell lysis. The two SOD proteins were individually overexpressed constitutively in Anabaena PCC7120, by genetic manipulation. Under nitrogen-fixing conditions, overexpression of MnSOD (sodA) enhanced oxidative stress tolerance, while FeSOD (sodB) overexpression was detrimental. Under nitrogen supplemented conditions, overexpression of either SOD protein, especially FeSOD, conferred significant tolerance against oxidative stress. The results demonstrate a nitrogen status-dependent protective role of individual superoxide dismutases in Anabaena PCC7120 during oxidative stress.

Methyl viologen: !induces! Cell lysis
FeSOD: !enhances! Oxidative stress tolerance
MnSOD: !enhances! Oxidative stress tolerance
