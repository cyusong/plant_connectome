<i>Vitis adenoclada</i> is a wild grape unique to China. It exhibits well resistance to heat, humidity, fungal disease, drought, and soil infertility. Here, we report the high-quality, chromosome-level genome assembly of GH6 (<i>V. adenoclada</i>). The 498.27 Mb genome contained 221.78 Mb of transposable elements, 28,660 protein-coding genes, and 481.44 Mb of sequences associated with 19 chromosomes. GH6 shares a common ancestor with PN40024 (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) from approximately 4.26-9.01 million years ago, whose divergence occurred later than <i>Vitis rotundifolia</i> and <i>Vitis riparia</i>. Widely-targeted metabolome and transcriptome analysis revealed that the profiles and metabolism of phenolic compounds in <i>V. adenoclada</i> varieties significantly were differed from other grape varieties. Specifically, <i>V. adenoclada</i> varieties were rich in phenolic acids and flavonols, whereas the flavan-3-ol and anthocyanin content was lower compared with other varieties that have <i>V. vinifera</i> consanguinity in this study. In addition, ferulic acid and stilbenes content were associated with higher expressions of COMT and STSs in <i>V. adenoclada</i> varieties. Furthermore, MYB2, MYB73-1, and MYB73-2 were presumably responsible for the high expression level of COMT in <i>V. adenoclada</i> berries. MYB12 (MYBF1) was positively correlated with PAL, CHS, FLS and UFGT.Meanwhile, MYB4 and MYBC2-L1 may inhibit the synthesis of flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins in two <i>V. adenoclada</i> varieties (YN2 and GH6). The publication of the <i>V. adenoclada</i> grape genome provides a molecular foundation for further revealing its flavor and quality characteristics, is also important for identifying favorable genes of the East Asian species for future breeding.
