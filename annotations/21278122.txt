['21278122', 'Control of energy homeostasis is crucial for plant survival, particularly under  biotic or abiotic stress conditions. Energy deprivation induces dramatic  reprogramming of transcription, facilitating metabolic adjustment. An in-depth  knowledge of the corresponding regulatory networks would provide opportunities  for the development of biotechnological strategies. Low energy stress activates  the Arabidopsis thaliana group S1 basic leucine zipper transcription factors  bZIP1 and bZIP53 by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms.  Gain-of-function approaches define these bZIPs as crucial transcriptional  regulators in Pro, Asn, and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Whereas  chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses confirm the direct binding of bZIP1 and  bZIP53 to promoters of key metabolic genes, such as ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE1 and  PROLINE DEHYDROGENASE, the G-box, C-box, or ACT motifs (ACTCAT) have been defined  as regulatory cis-elements in the starvation response. bZIP1 and bZIP53 were  shown to specifically heterodimerize with group C bZIPs. Although single  loss-of-function mutants did not affect starvation-induced transcription,  quadruple mutants of group S1 and C bZIPs displayed a significant impairment. We  therefore propose that bZIP1 and bZIP53 transduce low energy signals by  heterodimerization with members of the partially redundant C/S1 bZIP factor  network to reprogram primary metabolism in the starvation response.', '2011 Jan', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.075390', 'Droge-Laser']
