Plant cells are surrounded by a cell wall that provides shape and physically limits cell expansion. To sense the environment and status of cell wall structures, plants have evolved cell wall integrity-sensing mechanisms that involve a number of receptors at the plasma membrane. These receptors can bind cell wall components and/or hormones to coordinate processes in the cell wall and the cytoplasm. This review focuses on the role of leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) during cell wall development. LRXs are chimeric proteins that insolubilize in the cell wall and form protein-protein interaction platforms. LRXs bind RALF peptide hormones that modify cell wall expansion and also directly interact with the transmembrane receptor FERONIA, which is involved in cell growth regulation. LRX proteins, therefore, also represent a link between the cell wall and plasma membrane, perceiving extracellular signals and indirectly relaying this information to the cytoplasm.
