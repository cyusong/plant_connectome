['12225668', 'The biogenesis of microtubules comprises several steps, including the correct  folding of alpha- and beta-tubulin and heterodimer formation. In vitro studies  and the genetic analysis in yeast revealed that, after translation, alpha- and  beta-tubulin are processed by several chaperonins and microtubule-folding  cofactors (TFCs) to produce assembly-competent alpha-/beta-tubulin heterodimers.  One of the TFCs, TFC-C, does not exist in yeast, and a potential function of  TFC-C is thus based only on the biochemical analysis. In this study and in a very  recently published study by Steinborn and coworkers, the analysis of the  Arabidopsis porcino (por) mutant has shown that TFC-C is important for  microtubule function in vivo. The predicted POR protein shares weak amino acid  similarity with the human TFC-C (hTFC-C). Our finding that hTFC-C under the  control of the ubiquitously expressed 35S promoter can rescue the por mutant  phenotype shows that the POR gene encodes the Arabidopsis ortholog of hTFC-C. The  analysis of plants carrying a GFP:POR fusion construct showed that POR protein is  localized in the cytoplasm and is not associated with microtubules. While, in por  mutants, microtubule density was indistinguishable from wild-type, their  organization was affected.', '2002 Sep 3', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/s0960-9822(02)01109-0', 'Hulskamp']
