['15659627', 'To understand how the direction of root growth changes in response to obstacles,  light, and gravity, we characterized an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, wavy growth  2 (wav2), whose roots show a short-pitch pattern of wavy growth on inclined agar  medium. The roots of the wav2 mutant bent with larger curvature than those of the  wild-type seedlings in wavy growth and in gravitropic and phototropic responses.  The cell file rotations of the root epidermis of wav2-1 in the wavy growth  pattern were enhanced in both right-handed and left-handed rotations. WAV2  encodes a protein belonging to the BUD EMERGENCE 46 family with a transmembrane  domain at the N terminus and an alpha/beta-hydrolase domain at the C terminus.  Expression analyses showed that mRNA of WAV2 was expressed strongly in adult  plant roots and seedlings, especially in the root tip, the cell elongation zone,  and the stele. Our results suggest that WAV2 is not involved in sensing  environmental stimuli but that it negatively regulates stimulus-induced root  bending through inhibition of root tip rotation.', '2005 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.028530', 'Sakai']
