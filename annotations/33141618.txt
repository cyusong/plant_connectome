<i>Podosphaera xanthii</i> is the main causal agent of powdery mildew in cucurbits and, arguably, the most important fungal pathogen of cucurbit crops. Here, we present the first reference genome assembly for <i>P. xanthii</i>. We performed a hybrid genome assembly, using reads from Illumina NextSeq550 and PacBio Sequel S3. The short and long reads were assembled into 1,727 scaffolds with an N<sub>50</sub> size of 163,173 bp, resulting in a 142-Mb genome size. The combination of homology-based and <i>ab initio</i> predictions allowed the prediction of 14,911 complete genes. Repetitive sequences comprised 76.2% of the genome. Our <i>P. xanthii</i> genome assembly improves considerably the molecular resources for research on <i>P. xanthii</i>-cucurbit interactions and provides new opportunities for further genomics, transcriptomics, and evolutionary studies in powdery mildew fungi.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
