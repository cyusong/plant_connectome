Roses are highly valued as cut flowers worldwide but have limited vase life. Peduncle bending "bent neck" or "necking" is a major cause of reduced vase life, especially in some cultivars. Necking is thought to be caused by either an air embolism or accumulation of microorganisms at or within the stem end, blocking the xylem vessels and preventing water uptake. However, the underlying mechanisms of necking are poorly understood. Here, RNAseq analysis was applied to compare gene expression across three stages of peduncle necking (straight, <90°, and >90°), in the necking-susceptible <i>Rosa hybrida</i> cultivar H30. Most gene expression change was later in bending and there was, overall, more downregulation than upregulation of gene expression during necking. Photosynthetic, starch, and lignin biosynthesis genes were all downregulated, while genes associated with galactose metabolism, producing raffinose and trehalose that are both related to osmoprotection, were upregulated. Genes associated with starch breakdown, autophagy, and senescence were also upregulated, as were most of the NAC and WRKY transcription factors, involved in stress and senescence regulation. Microscopy showed a cellular collapse in the peduncle. These data support a possible mechanism, whereby a reduction in water transport leads to a cellular collapse in the peduncle, accompanied by upregulation of senescence and drought responses.
