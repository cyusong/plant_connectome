Posttranslational histone modifications and the dynamics of histone variant H2A.Z are key mechanisms underlying the floral transition. In yeast, SWR1-C and NuA4-C mediate the deposition of H2A.Z and the acetylation of histone H4, H2A and H2A.Z, respectively. Yaf9 is a subunit shared by both chromatin-remodeling complexes. The significance of the two Arabidopsis YAF9 homologues, YAF9A and YAF9B, is unknown. To get an insight into the role of Arabidopsis YAF9 proteins in plant developmental responses, we followed physiological, genetic, genomic, epigenetic, proteomics and cell biology approaches. Our data revealed that YAF9A and YAF9B are histone H3 readers with unequally redundant functions. Double mutant yaf9a yaf9b plants display pleiotropic developmental phenotypic alterations as well as misregulation of a wide variety of genes. We demonstrated that YAF9 proteins regulate flowering time by both FLC-dependent and independent mechanisms that work in parallel with SWR1-C. Interestingly, we show that YAF9A binds FLC chromatin and that YAF9 proteins regulate FLC expression by modulating the acetylation levels of H2A.Z and H4 but not H2A.Z deposition. Our work highlights the key role exerted by YAF9 homologues in the posttranslational modification of canonical histones and variants that regulate gene expression in plants to control development.
