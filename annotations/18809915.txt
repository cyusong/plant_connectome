['18809915', 'Abscission is a developmental program that results in the active shedding of  infected or nonfunctional organs from a plant body. Here, we establish a  signaling pathway that controls abscission in Arabidopsis thaliana from ligand,  to receptors, to downstream effectors. Loss of function mutations in  Inflorescence Deficient in Abscission (IDA), which encodes a predicted secreted  small protein, the receptor-like protein kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA-like 2  (HSL2), the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase 4 (MKK4) and MKK5, and a  dominant-negative form of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 6 (MPK6) in a mpk3  mutant background all have abscission-defective phenotypes. Conversely,  expression of constitutively active MKKs rescues the abscission-defective  phenotype of hae hsl2 and ida plants. Additionally, in hae hsl2 and ida plants,  MAP kinase activity is reduced in the receptacle, the part of the stem that holds  the floral organs. Plants overexpressing IDA in a hae hsl2 background have  abscission defects, indicating HAE and HSL2 are epistatic to IDA. Taken together,  these results suggest that the sequential action of IDA, HAE and HSL2, and a MAP  kinase cascade regulates the programmed separation of cells in the abscission  zone.', '2008 Oct 7', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0805539105', 'Walker']
