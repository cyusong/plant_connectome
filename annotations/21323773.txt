['21323773', 'Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GDPD), which hydrolyzes  glycerophosphodiesters into sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) and the corresponding  alcohols, plays an important role in various physiological processes in both  prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, little is known about the physiological  significance of GDPD in plants. Here, we characterized the Arabidopsis GDPD  family that can be classified into canonical GDPD (AtGDPD1-6) and GDPD-like  (AtGDPDL1-7) subfamilies. In vitro analysis of enzymatic activities showed that  AtGDPD1 and AtGDPDL1 hydrolyzed glycerolphosphoglycerol, glycerophosphocholine  and glycerophosphoethanolamine, but the maximum activity of AtGDPD1 was much  higher than that of AtGDPDL1 under our assay conditions. Analyses of gene  expression patterns revealed that all AtGDPD genes except for AtGDPD4 were  transcriptionally active in flowers and siliques. In addition, the gene family  displayed overlapping and yet distinguishable patterns of expression in roots,  leaves and stems, indicating functional redundancy as well as specificity of GDPD  genes. AtGDPDs but not AtGDPDLs are up-regulated by inorganic phosphate (P(i) )  starvation. Loss-of-function of the plastid-localized AtGDPD1 leads to a  significant decrease in GDPD activity, G-3-P content, P(i) content and seedling  growth rate only under P(i) starvation compared with the wild type (WT). However,  membrane lipid compositions in the P(i) -deprived seedlings remain unaltered  between the AtGDPD1 knockout mutant and WT. Thus, we suggest that the  GDPD-mediated lipid metabolic pathway may be involved in release of P(i) from  phospholipids during P(i) starvation.', '2011 Jun', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04538.x', 'Huang']
