Drought is the most prominent threat to global agricultural production. The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family is related to the response to a series of abiotic stress. In this case, apple calli and the seedlings of MdbZIP74-RNAi transgenic lines were obtained. Under osmotic stress and moderate drought conditions, the content of malondialdehyde, relative water content and other stress-related assays were measured. MdbZIP74 was found to negatively regulate the osmotic tolerance of apple callus. The growth of MdbZIP74-RNAi calli enhanced resistance without significant production loss. The silencing of MdbZIP74 contributes to redox balance and the adaptability of apple seedlings to moderate drought conditions. Four related differentially expressed genes in the biosynthesis of cytokinin and catabolic pathway were identified through a transcriptome analysis of MdbZIP74-RNAi seedlings under moderate drought conditions. MdLOG8 was further identified as the target of MdbZIP74 involved in the drought adaptability of apple plants using a dual experiment. Further confirmation showed MdLOG8 was maintained in the MdbZIP74-RNAi seedlings presumably acting as the growth regulator to enhance drought adaptability. It was concluded that the correct regulation of cytokinin level under moderate drought conditions maintains the redox balance and avoids the situation of plants surviving with the minimal resources.
