Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a ubiquitous coenzyme, is required for many physiological reactions and processes. However, it remains largely unknown how NAD affects plant response to salt stress. We isolated a salt-sensitive mutant named hypersensitive to salt stress (hss) from an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutation population. A point mutation was identified by MutMap in the encoding region of Quinolinate Synthase (QS) gene required for the de novo synthesis of NAD. This point mutation caused a substitution of amino acid in the highly-conserved NadA domain of QS, resulting in an impairment of NAD biosynthesis in the mutant. Molecular and chemical complementation have restored the response of the hss mutant to salt stress, indicating that the decreased NAD contents in the mutant were responsible for its hypersensitivity to salt stress. Furthermore, the endogenous levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and proline were also reduced in stress-treated hss mutant. The application of ABA or proline could alleviate stress-induced oxidative damage of the mutant and partially rescue its hypersensitivity to salt stress, but not affect NAD concentration. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the NadA domain of QS is important for NAD biosynthesis, and NAD participates in plant response to salt stress by affecting stress-induced accumulation of ABA and proline.

QS: !synthesizes! NAD
NAD: !affects! Plant response to salt stress
hss: !has! Point mutation in QS gene
NAD: !enhances! ABA and proline accumulation
ABA/proline: !alleviate! Oxidative damage of hss mutant
