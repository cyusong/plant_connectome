['16527743', 'Fertilization in flowering plants initiates the development of the embryo and  endosperm, which nurtures the embryo. A few genes subjected to imprinting are  expressed in endosperm from their maternal allele, while their paternal allele  remains silenced. Imprinting of the FWA gene involves DNA methylation. Mechanisms  controlling imprinting of the Polycomb group (Pc-G) gene MEDEA (MEA) are not yet  fully understood. Here we report that MEA imprinting is regulated by histone  methylation. This epigenetic chromatin modification is mediated by several Pc-G  activities during the entire plant life cycle. We show that Pc-G complexes  maintain MEA transcription silenced throughout vegetative life and male  gametogenesis. In endosperm, the maternal allele of MEA encodes an essential  component of a Pc-G complex, which maintains silencing of the paternal MEA  allele. Hence, we conclude that a feedback loop controls MEA imprinting. This  feedback loop ensures a complete maternal control of MEA expression from both  parental alleles and might have provided a template for evolution of imprinting  in plants.', '2006 Mar 7', 'Curr Biol', '10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.020', 'Berger']
