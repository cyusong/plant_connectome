Plant transformation technology is frequently the rate-limiting step in gene function analysis in non-model plants. An important tool for root biologists is the Agrobacterium rhizogenes-derived composite plant, which has made possible genetic analyses in a wide variety of transformation recalcitrant dicotyledonous plants. The novel, rapid and inexpensive ex vitro method for producing composite plants described in this report represents a significant advance over existing composite plant induction protocols, which rely on expensive and time-consuming in vitro conditions. The utility of the new system is validated by expression and RNAi silencing of GFP in transgenic roots of composite plants, and is bolstered further by experimental disruption, via RNAi silencing, of endogenous plant resistance to the plant parasitic nematode Meloidogyne incognita in transgenic roots of Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Motelle composite plants. Critical parameters of the method are described and discussed herein.
