['26648949', 'Maintenance and precise regulation of sister chromatid cohesion is essential for  faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Cohesin cofactors  contribute to cohesin dynamics and interact with cohesin complexes during cell  cycle. One of these, PDS5, also known as SPO76, is essential during mitosis and  meiosis in several organisms and also plays a role in DNA repair. In yeast, the  complex Wapl-Pds5 controls cohesion maintenance and colocalizes with cohesin  complexes into chromosomes. In Arabidopsis, AtWAPL proteins are essential during  meiosis, however, the role of AtPDS5 remains to be ascertained. Here we have  isolated mutants for each of the five AtPDS5 genes (A-E) and obtained, after  different crosses between them, double, triple, and even quadruple mutants  (Atpds5a Atpds5b Atpds5c Atpds5e). Depletion of AtPDS5 proteins has a weak impact  on meiosis, but leads to severe effects on development, fertility, somatic  homologous recombination (HR) and DNA repair. Furthermore, this cohesin cofactor  could be important for the function of the AtSMC5/AtSMC6 complex. Contrarily to  its function in other species, our results suggest that AtPDS5 is dispensable  during the meiotic division of Arabidopsis, although it plays an important role  in DNA repair by HR.', '2015', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2015.01034', 'Santos']
