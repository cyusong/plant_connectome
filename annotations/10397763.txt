['10397763', 'Membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells relies on recognition between v-SNAREs on  transport vesicles and t-SNAREs on target membranes. Here we report the  identification of AtVTI1a and AtVTI1b, two Arabidopsis homologues of the yeast  v-SNARE Vti1p, which is required for multiple transport steps in yeast. AtVTI1a  and AtVTI1b share 60% amino acid identity with one another and are 32 and 30%  identical to the yeast protein, respectively. By suppressing defects found in  specific strains of yeast vti1 temperature-sensitive mutants, we show that  AtVTI1a can substitute for Vti1p in Golgi-to-prevacuolar compartment (PVC)  transport, whereas AtVTI1b substitutes in two alternative pathways: the vacuolar  import of alkaline phosphatase and the so-called cytosol-to-vacuole pathway used  by aminopeptidase I. Both AtVTI1a and AtVTI1b are expressed in all major organs  of Arabidopsis. Using subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy, we  show that AtVTI1a colocalizes with the putative vacuolar cargo receptor AtELP on  the trans-Golgi network and the PVC. AtVTI1a also colocalizes with the t-SNARE  AtPEP12p to the PVC. In addition, AtVTI1a and AtPEP12p can be  coimmunoprecipitated from plant cell extracts. We propose that AtVTI1a functions  as a v-SNARE responsible for targeting AtELP-containing vesicles from the  trans-Golgi network to the PVC, and that AtVTI1b is involved in a different  membrane transport process.', '1999 Jul', 'Mol Biol Cell', '10.1091/mbc.10.7.2251', 'Raikhel']
