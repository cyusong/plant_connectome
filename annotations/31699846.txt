Many seeds are green during development, and light has been shown to play a role in the efficiency with which maternally supplied substrates are converted into storage compounds. However, the effects of light on the fluxes through central metabolism that determine this efficiency are poorly understood. Here, we used metabolic flux analysis to determine the effects of light on central metabolism in developing embryos of false flax (<i>Camelina sativa</i>). Metabolic efficiency in <i>C. sativa</i> is of interest because, despite its growing importance as a model oilseed and engineering target and its potential as a biofuel crop, its yields are lower than other major oilseed species. Culture conditions under which steady-state growth and composition of developing embryos match those in planta were used to quantify substrate uptake and respiration rates. The carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) was 21% ± 3% in the dark and 42% ± 4% under high light. Under physiological illumination, the CCE (32% ± 2%) was substantially lower than in green and nongreen oilseeds studied previously. <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>C isotopic labeling experiments were used together with computer-aided modeling to map fluxes through central metabolism. Fluxes through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) were the principal source of CO<sub>2</sub> production and strongly negatively correlated with CCE across light levels. OPPP fluxes were greatly in excess of demand for NAD(P)H for biosynthesis and larger than those measured in other systems. Excess reductant appears to be dissipated via cyanide-insensitive respiration. OPPP enzymes therefore represent a potential target for increasing efficiency and yield in <i>C. sativa</i>.
