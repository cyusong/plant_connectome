It has been suggested that flowers of some angiosperms mimic vertebrate faeces (dung) in order to exploit insect pollinators that utilize faeces as a source of food and/or oviposition sites. We investigated a potential case of mimicry in Wurmbea elatior (Colchicaceae), a lily that exhibits a faecal odour and pattern of dark spots on the corolla. We found that W. elatior is pollinated by a broad assemblage of coprophagous flies and is dependent on pollinator visits for seed production. The flowers emit volatiles that are characteristic of vertebrate faeces, and three of these compounds - skatole, indole, and an unidentified compound - elicited electrophysiological antennal responses from flies. Artificial flowers laced with indole and skatole or skatole alone attracted the same assemblage of flies as was recorded on flowers of W. elatior. Spotted artificial flowers attracted twice as many flies as did those lacking spots. Experimental addition of indole and skatole to flowers of Wurmbea kraussii, a congener with unscented flowers pollinated by hoverflies, induced a shift to an insect visitor assemblage dominated by coprophagous flies. This study clarifies the roles of volatile emissions (particularly skatole) and visual signals in floral dung mimicry.
