Conclusion 729 Acknowledgements 729 References 729 SUMMARY: Long-term persistent seed banking is a common temporal bet-hedging strategy in plants to adapt to unpredictable environments. The population genomics perspective developed in this article suggests that seed banking determines plant nucleotide diversity by decreasing the rate of genetic drift and the effect of linked selection while increasing mutational input. As a result, persistent seed banks are important factors determining the magnitude of the discrepancy between the census size of the above-ground plant population and its genetic diversity, an effect known as the Lewontin paradox. The theoretical population genetics predictions presented here can be tested by combining genome-wide polymorphism data with ecological studies of dormancy.
