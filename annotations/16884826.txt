In order to assess whether exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA) through the rooting medium could modulate the photosynthetic capacity of two wheat cultivars differing in salinity tolerance, a hydroponic experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions. Seeds of a salt tolerant (S-24) and a moderately salt sensitive (MH-97) cultivar were germinated at 0 or 150 mM NaCl in Hoagland's nutrient solution containing different levels of salicylic acid (SA) (0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 mM) for 7d. Seven-day old wheat seedlings were transferred to hydroponics and grown at 0, or 150 mM NaCl for for further 30 d. Different levels of salicylic acid (SA) were also maintained in the solution culture. After 30 d, four plants out of six were harvested and the remaining plants were left for the estimation of yield attributes Salt stress reduced the growth and grain yield of both cultivars. However, cv. S-24 performed better than MH-97 under salt stress with respect to leaf area, and grain yield. Exogenous application of SA promoted growth and yield, and counteracted the salt stress-induced growth inhibition of salt tolerant S-24, whereas for MH-97 there was no improvement in growth or grain yield with SA application. Of the varying SA levels used, the most effective levels for promoting growth and grain yield were 0.75 and 0.25 mM under normal and saline conditions, respectively. The improvement in growth and grain yield of S-24 due to SA application was associated with improved photosynthetic capacity. Changes in photosynthetic rate due to SA application were not due to stomatal limitations, but were associated with metabolic factors, other than photosynthetic pigments and leaf carotenoids.
