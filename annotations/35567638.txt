More methylation changes occur in late interval than in early interval of wheat seed development with protein and the starch synthesis-related pathway enriched in the later stages. Wheat seed development is a critical process to determining wheat yield and quality, which is controlled by genetics, epigenetics and environments. The N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification is a reversible and dynamic process and plays regulatory role in plant development and stress responses. To better understand the role of m<sup>6</sup>A in wheat grain development, we characterized the m<sup>6</sup>A modification at 10 day post-anthesis (DPA), 20 DPA and 30 DPA in wheat grain development. m<sup>6</sup>A-seq identified 30,615, 30,326, 27,676 high confidence m<sup>6</sup>A peaks from the 10DPA, 20DPA, and 30DPA, respectively, and enriched at 3'UTR. There were 29,964, 29,542 and 26,834 unique peaks identified in AN0942_10d, AN0942_20d and AN0942_30d. One hundred and forty-two genes were methylated by m<sup>6</sup>A throughout seed development, 940 genes methylated in early grain development (AN0942_20d vs AN0942_10d), 1542 genes in late grain development (AN0942_30d vs AN0942_20d), and 1190 genes between early and late development stage (AN0942_30d vs AN0942_10d). KEGG enrichment analysis found that protein-related pathways and the starch synthesis-related pathway were significantly enriched in the later stages of seed development. Our results provide novel knowledge on m<sup>6</sup>A dynamic changes and its roles in wheat grain development.
