Isoflavans and pterocarpans are the major biosynthetically connected phytoalexins in legumes. A search of the expressed sequence tag library of a model legume Lotus japonicus, which produces an (-)-isoflavan, for homologs of phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase catalyzing the reductive cleavage of dihydrofurans, yielded seven full-length cDNAs, and the encoded proteins were analyzed in vitro. Four of them cleaved the dihydrofuran of a pterocarpan medicarpin to yield an isoflavan (-)-vestitol and were designated pterocarpan reductase (PTR). Two PTRs displayed enantiospecificity to (-)-medicarpin, representing genuine L. japonicus PTRs, while the other two lacked enantiospecificity and were presumed to be evolutionarily primitive types.
