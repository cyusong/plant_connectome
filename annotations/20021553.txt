Gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) are two types of phytohormones that play important roles during stamen development. For example, Arabidopsis plants deficient in either of GA or JA develop short stamens. An apparent question to ask is whether GA action and JA action during stamen filament development are independent of each other or are in a hierarchy. Recent studies showed that GA modulates the expression of genes essential for JA biosynthesis to promote JA production and high levels of JA will induce the expression of three MYB genes MYB21, MYB24 and MYB57. These three MYB genes are crucial factors for the normal development of stamen filament in Arabidopsis.
