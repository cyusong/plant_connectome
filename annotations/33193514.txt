In crosses between genetically divergent parents, traits such as weakness and sterility often segregate in later generations. This hybrid breakdown functions as a reproductive barrier and reduces selection efficiency in crossbreeding. Here, I provide an overview of hybrid breakdown in rice crosses and discuss ways to avoid and mitigate the effects of hybrid breakdown on rice crossbreeding, including genomics-assisted breeding.

Gene: !affects! Hybrid breakdown
Gene: !localizes to! Rice crosses
Gene: !interacts with! Genomics-assisted breeding
Gene: !enhances! Selection efficiency
Gene: !represses! Reproductive barrier
Gene: !synthesizes! Weakness and sterility
