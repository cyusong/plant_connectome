Despite generating an obvious mutant phenotype, whether the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient regulation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutation influences cyclic electron transport (CET) around PSI is a topic of debate. Results of electrochromic shift analysis show that proton conductivity across the thylakoid membrane (<i>g</i> <sub>H</sub> <sup>+</sup>) in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant is enhanced at high light intensity. Given this observation, PGR5 was proposed to regulate ATP synthase activity rather than mediating CET. The originally reported <i>pgr5</i> phenotype reflects a smaller proton motive force (pmf) and could be explained by this H<sup>+</sup> leakage model. In this study, we genetically reexamined the high-<i>g</i> <sub>H</sub> <sup>+</sup> phenotype of the <i>pgr5</i> mutant. Transgenic lines in which flavodiiron protein-dependent pseudo-CET replaced PGR5-dependent CET had wild-type levels of <i>g</i> <sub>H</sub> <sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the high-<i>g</i> <sub>H</sub> <sup>+</sup> phenotype in <i>pgr5</i> plants is caused secondarily by the low pmf. The <i>pgr1</i> mutant shows a similar reduction in pmf because of enhanced sensitivity of its cytochrome <i>b</i> <sub>6</sub> <i>f</i> complex to lumenal acidification. In contrast to the <i>pgr5</i> mutant, <i>g</i> <sub>H</sub> <sup>+</sup> was lower in the <i>pgr1</i> mutant than in the wild type. In the <i>pgr1 pgr5</i> double mutants, <i>g</i> <sub>H</sub> <sup>+</sup> was intermediate to <i>g</i> <sub>H</sub> <sup>+</sup> values of the respective single mutants. It is unlikely that <i>g</i> <sub>H</sub> <sup>+</sup> is upregulated simply in response to a low pmf. We did not observe uncoupling of the thylakoid membrane in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant upon monitoring the quenching of 9-aminoacridine fluorescence. We conclude that the <i>g</i> <sub>H</sub> <sup>+</sup> parameter may be influenced by other factors not related to the H<sup>+</sup> leakage through ATP synthase. It is unlikely that the <i>pgr5</i> mutant leaks protons from the thylakoid membrane.
