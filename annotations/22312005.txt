['22312005', 'Many membrane proteins are involved in the transport of nutrients in plants.  While the import of amino acids into plant cells is, in principle, well  understood, their export has been insufficiently described. Here, we present the  identification and characterization of the membrane protein Siliques Are Red1  (SIAR1) from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that is able to translocate amino  acids bidirectionally into as well as out of the cell. Analyses in yeast and  oocytes suggest a SIAR1-mediated export of amino acids. In Arabidopsis, SIAR1  localizes to the plasma membrane and is expressed in the vascular tissue, in the  pericycle, in stamen, and in the chalazal seed coat of ovules and developing  seeds. Mutant alleles of SIAR1 accumulate anthocyanins as a symptom of reduced  amino acid content in the early stages of silique development. Our data  demonstrate that the SIAR1-mediated export of amino acids plays an important role  in organic nitrogen allocation and particularly in amino acid homeostasis in  developing siliques.', '2012 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.192583', 'Koch']
