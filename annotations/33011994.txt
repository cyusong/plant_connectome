CONSTANS-LIKE (COL) family members are commonly implicated in light signal transduction during early photomorphogenesis. However, some of their functions remain unclear. Here, we propose a role for COL13 in hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that COL13 RNA accumulates at high levels in hypocotyls and that a disruption in the COL13 function via a T-DNA insertion or RNAi led to the formation of longer hypocotyls of Arabidopsis seedlings under red light. On the contrary, overexpression of COL13 resulted in the formation of shorter hypocotyls. Using various genetic, genomic, and biochemical assays, we proved that another COL protein, COL3, directly binds to the promoter of COL13, and the promoter region of COL3 was targeted by the transcription factor LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), to form an HY5-COL3-COL13 regulatory chain for regulating hypocotyl elongation under red light. Additionally, further study demonstrated that COL13 interacts with COL3, and COL13 promotes the interaction between COL3 and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1), suggesting a possible COP1-dependent COL3-COL13 feedback pathway. Our results provide new information regarding the gene network in mediating hypocotyl elongation.
