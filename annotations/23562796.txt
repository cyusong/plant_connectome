['23562796', 'The TCP class of genes is found only in plants and is represented by the first  three identified genes: teosinte branched 1, cycloidea and pcf. Members belonging  to this class are important regulators of plant growth, development and control  multiple traits in diverse plant species, including flower and petal asymmetry,  plant architecture, leaf morphogenesis and senescence, embryo growth and  circadian rhythm. Here we described a member of the TCP-P subfamily called  AtTCP23. Using qRT-PCR we present evidence that AtTCP23 is ubiquitously express  in all organs examined. To ascertain AtTCP23 localization, we fused GFP at the  C-terminal position and analyzed stable expression by confocal microscopy.  Transgenic lines harboring the full-length protein (OxTCP23:GFP) seems to  accumulate GFP in the nucleus. In order to analyze AtTCP23 function, we obtained  a T-DNA insertional line and developed AtTCP23 over-expression (OxTCP23) lines.  Phenotypic analysis indicates that tcp23-1 knockout line has an early-flowering  phenotype while overexpression lines (OxTCP23 and OxTCP23:eGFP) presents opposite  phenotype. Besides that those lines have leaf morphology alteration, pale leaf  borders and smaller roots. Thus we propose in this study that AtTCP23 may be  involved in flowering time control and plant development.', '2013 Jun', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.03.009', 'Sachetto-Martins']
