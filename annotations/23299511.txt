miRNAs are endogenous approx 22 nucleotide RNA which mediates transcriptional or Post-transcriptional gene regulation and play a critical role in diverse aspects of plant development. miRNA identification in wet lab have various constraints, it is time consuming and expensive. It also faces the limitation of identifying miRNAs expressed at specific time and/or at special conditions. Due to the nature of strong conservation of miRNA in plant species, the use of comparative genomics approach for expressed sequence tags (ESTs), Genome Survey Sequence (GSS) and structural feature criteria filter has paved the way toward the identification of conserved miRNAs from the plant species whose genomes are not yet available in public domain. To identify the novel miRNA from Jatropha curcas, a total of 46862 EST sequences and 1569 GSS were searched for homology to previously known viridiplantae 2502 mature miRNA. After predicting the RNA secondary structure, 24 new potential miRNA were identified in J. curcas. Using the newly identified miRNA sequences, a total of 78 potential target genes were identified for 3 miRNA families. Most of the miRNA targeted genes were predicted to encode transcription factors that regulate cell growth and development, signaling, and metabolism. These findings considerably broaden the scope of understanding the functions of miRNA in J. curcas.
