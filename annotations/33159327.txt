Opening of stomata in plants with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is mainly shifted to the night period when atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is fixed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and stored as malic acid in the vacuole. As such, CAM plants ameliorate transpirational water losses and display substantially higher water-use efficiency compared with C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants. In the past decade significant technical advances have allowed an unprecedented exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes and metabolomes of CAM plants and efforts are ongoing to engineer the CAM pathway in C<sub>3</sub> plants. Whilst research efforts have traditionally focused on nocturnal carboxylation, less information is known regarding the drivers behind diurnal malate remobilisation from the vacuole that liberates CO<sub>2</sub> to be fixed by RuBisCo behind closed stomata. To shed more light on this process, we provide a stoichiometric analysis to identify potentially rate-limiting steps underpinning diurnal malate mobilisation and help direct future research efforts. Within this remit we address three key questions: Q1 Does light-dependent assimilation of CO<sub>2</sub> via RuBisCo dictate the rate of malate mobilisation? Q2: Do the enzymes responsible for malate decarboxylation limit daytime mobilisation from the vacuole? Q3: Does malate efflux from the vacuole set the pace of decarboxylation?
