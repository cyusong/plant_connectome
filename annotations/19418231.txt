We analyzed the response of rice to Magnaporthe oryzae infection using two mutant strains deficient in Mgb1 and Mst12, which are essential for the development of appresoria and penetration pegs. Both mutants induced the much lower levels of accumulation of phytoalexins than wild-type, suggesting that the massive production of phytoalexins requires the fungal invasion of rice cells. Intense accumulation of H2O2 in a single whole cell also required fungal penetration. Microarray analysis of rice gene expression revealed mutant-specific gene expression, indicating that signal exchange between rice and M. oryzae commence before fungal penetration of the rice cell. In situ detection of mRNAs for peroxidase and beta-1,3-glucanase showed that expression of these genes also occurs after penetration as observed for phytoalexin production.
