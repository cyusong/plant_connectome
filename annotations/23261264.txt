We here report characterization of a grape (Vitis vinifera) acyl-CoA-binding protein (VvACBP). Expression of VvACBP was detected in grape leaves exposed to tunicamycin-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as well as cold and heat shock treatments. In tendrils and peduncles, however, high-temperature treatment induced BiP (luminal binding protein) expression, a marker of ER stress in berry skin, but not VvACBP expression. We hypothesize that VvACBP may be sorted to the periphery of plant cells. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants, expressing VvACBP, exhibited slowed-down floral transition. The gene expression of proteins related to the photoperiodic pathway, CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1), was down-regulated in transgenic seedlings. These results underscore the possibility that VvACBP may affect the regulation of floral transition in Arabidopsis by suppressing the photoperiodic pathway. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants also exhibited morphological changes such as thicker inflorescences and rosette leaves. In addition, the rosette leaves of the transgenic plants had higher anthocyanin, total phenol, and chlorophyll contents than those of the control plants. Finally, the transgenic plants showed disease resistance to Pseudomonas syringae and Colletotrichum higginsianum, suggesting that VvACBP may also enhance disease resistance in grapevine.
