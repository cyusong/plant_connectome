Chromosomal inversions occur in natural populations of many species, and may underlie reproductive isolation and local adaptation. Traditional methods of inversion discovery are labor-intensive and lack sensitivity. Here, we report the use of three-dimensional contact probabilities between genomic loci as assayed by chromosome-conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C) to detect multi-megabase polymorphic inversions in four barley genotypes. Inversions are validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and Bionano optical mapping. We propose Hi-C as a generally applicable method for inversion discovery in natural populations.
