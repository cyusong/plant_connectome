['35831297', 'The conversion of light energy to chemical energy by photosynthesis requires the  concerted action of large protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane. Recent  work has provided fundamental insights into the three-dimensional structure of  these complexes, but how they are assembled from hundreds of parts remains poorly  understood. Particularly little is known about the biogenesis of the cytochrome  b(6)f complex (Cytb(6)f), the redox-coupling complex that interconnects the two  photosystems. Here we report the identification of a factor that guides the  assembly of Cytb(6)f in thylakoids of chloroplasts. The protein,  DE-ETIOLATION-INDUCED PROTEIN 1 (DEIP1), resides in the thylakoid membrane and is  essential for photoautotrophic growth. Knock-out mutants show a specific loss of  Cytb(6)f, and are defective in complex assembly. We demonstrate that DEIP1  interacts with the two cytochrome subunits of the complex, PetA and PetB, and  mediates the assembly of intermediates in Cytb(6)f biogenesis. The identification  of DEIP1 provides an entry point into the study of the assembly pathway of a  crucial complex in photosynthetic electron transfer.', '2022 Jul 13', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/s41467-022-31758-7', 'ORCID:']
