Plant roots acquire nitrogen predominantly as ammonium and nitrate, which besides serving as nutrients, also have signaling roles. Re-addition of nitrate to starved plants rapidly re-programs the metabolism and gene expression, but the earliest responses to nitrogen deprivation are unknown. Here, the early transcriptional and (phospho)proteomic responses of roots to nitrate or ammonium deprivation were analyzed. The rapid transcriptional repression of known nitrate-induced genes proceeded the tissue NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration drop, with the transcription factor genes LBD37/38 and HRS1/HHO1 among those with earliest significant change. Similar rapid transcriptional repression occurred in loss-of-function mutants of the nitrate response factor NLP7 and some transcripts were stabilized by nitrate. In contrast, an early transcriptional response to ammonium deprivation was almost completely absent. However, ammonium deprivation induced a rapid and transient perturbation of the proteome and a differential phosphorylation pattern in proteins involved in adjusting the pH and cation homeostasis, plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup> , NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> and water fluxes. Fewer differential phosphorylation patterns in transporters, kinases and other proteins occurred with nitrate deprivation. The deprivation responses were not just opposite to the re-supply responses, but identified NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deprivation-induced mRNA decay and signaling candidates potentially reporting the external nitrate status to the cell.
