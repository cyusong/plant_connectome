Gibberellic acid (GA) promotes seed germination, elongation growth, and flowering time in plants. GA responses are repressed by DELLA proteins, which contain an N-terminal DELLA domain essential for GA-dependent proteasomal degradation of DELLA repressors. Mutations of or within the DELLA domain of DELLA repressors have been described for species including Arabidopsis thaliana, wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays), and barley (Hordeum vulgare), and we show that these mutations confer GA insensitivity when introduced into the Arabidopsis GA INSENSITIVE (GAI) DELLA repressor. We also demonstrate that Arabidopsis mutants lacking the three GA INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) GA receptor genes are GA insensitive with respect to GA-promoted growth responses, GA-promoted DELLA repressor degradation, and GA-regulated gene expression. Our genetic interaction studies indicate that GAI and its close homolog REPRESSOR OF ga1-3 are the major growth repressors in a GA receptor mutant background. We further demonstrate that the GA insensitivity of the GAI DELLA domain mutants is explained in all cases by the inability of the mutant proteins to interact with the GID1A GA receptor. Since we found that the GAI DELLA domain alone can mediate GA-dependent GID1A interactions, we propose that the DELLA domain functions as a receiver domain for activated GA receptors.
