Anthocyanin is a vital indicator for both fruit nutritional and commercial value. Anthocyanin accumulation is a surprisingly complicated process mediated by multiple networks associated with genetic, developmental, hormonal, and environmental factors. Transcriptional regulation along with epigenetic regulation constitutes the dominant molecular framework for anthocyanin biosynthesis. Here, we focus on current knowledge on regulatory mechanisms of anthocyanin accumulation, with emphasis on the latest progress in transcriptional and epigenetic regulation and the crosstalk between various signaling pathways. We present an emerging picture of how various internal and external stimuli control anthocyanin biosynthesis. Additionally, we discuss the synergistic or antagonistic effect of developmental, hormonal and environmental cues on anthocyanin accumulation in fruit.
