Vacuole H(+)-ATPases (VHAs) are plant proton pumps, which play a crucial role in plant growth and stress tolerance. In the present study, we demonstrated that the apple vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit A (MdVHA-A) is highly conserved with subunit A of VHA (VHA-A) proteins from other plant species. MdVHA-A was expressed in vegetative and reproductive organs. In apple in vitro shoot cultures, expression was induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated osmotic stress. We further verified that over-expression of MdVHA-A conferred transgenic tobacco seedlings with enhanced vacuole H+-ATPase (VHA) activity and improved drought tolerance. The enhanced PEG-mimic drought response of transgenic tobacco seedlings was related to an extended lateral root system (dependent on auxin translocation) and more efficient osmotic adjustment. Our results indicate that MdVHA-A is a candidate gene for improving drought tolerance in plants.
