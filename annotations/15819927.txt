Adaptation of Spirogyra insignis (Chlorophyceae) to growth and survival in an extreme natural environment (sulphureous waters from La Hedionda Spa, S. Spain) was analysed by using an experimental model. Photosynthesis and growth of the alga were inhibited when it was cultured in La Hedionda Spa waters (LHW), but after further incubation for several weeks, the culture survived due to the growth of a variant that was resistant to LHW. A Luria-Delbruck fluctuation analysis was carried out to distinguish between resistant filaments arising from rare spontaneous mutations and resistant filaments arising from other mechanisms of adaptation. It was demonstrated that the resistant filaments arose randomly by rare spontaneous mutations before the addition of LHW (preselective mutations). The rate of spontaneous mutation from sensitivity to resistance was 2.7 x 10(-7) mutants per cell division. Since LHW(resistant) mutants have a diminished growth rate, they are maintained in nonsulphureous natural waters as the result of a balance between new resistants arising from spontaneous mutation and resistants eliminated by natural selection. Thus, recurrence of rare spontaneous preselective mutations ensures the survival of the alga in sulphureous waters.
