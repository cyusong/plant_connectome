NF-YCs are important transcription factors with diverse functions in the plant kingdoms including seed development. <i>NF-YC8</i>, <i>9</i>, <i>10</i>, <i>11</i> and <i>12</i> are close homologs with similar seed-specific expression patterns. Despite the fact that some of the <i>NF-YCs</i> are functionally known; their biological roles have not been systematically explored yet, given the potential functional redundancy. In this study, we generated pentuple mutant <i>pnfyc</i> of <i>NF-YC8-12</i> and revealed their functions in the regulation of grain quality and seed germination. <i>pnfyc</i> grains displayed significantly more chalkiness with abnormal starch granule packaging. <i>pnfyc</i> seed germination and post-germination growth are much slower than the wild-type NIP, largely owing to the GA-deficiency as exogenous GA was able to fully recover the germination phenotype. The RNA-seq experiment identified a total of 469 differentially expressed genes, and several GA-, ABA- and grain quality control-related genes might be transcriptionally regulated by the five NF-YCs, as revealed by qRT-PCR analysis. The results demonstrated the redundant functions of <i>NF-YC8-12</i> in regulating GA pathways that underpin rice grain quality and seed germination, and shed a novel light on the functions of the seed-specific <i>NF-YCs</i>.
