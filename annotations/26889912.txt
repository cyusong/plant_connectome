['26889912', 'Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) in plants contains  an extra domain that is made up from proteins homologous to prokaryotic  gamma-carbonic anhydrases (gammaCA). This domain has been suggested to participate in  complex I assembly or to support transport of mitochondrial CO2 to the  chloroplast. Here, we generated mutants lacking CA1 and CA2 - two out of three CA  proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. Double mutants were characterized at the  developmental and physiological levels. Furthermore, the composition and activity  of the mETC were determined, and mutated CA versions were used for  complementation assays. Embryo development of double mutants was strongly delayed  and seed development stopped before maturation. Mutant plants could only be  rescued on sucrose media, showed severe stress symptoms and never produced viable  seeds. By contrast, callus cultures were only slightly affected in growth.  Complex I was undetectable in the double mutants, but complex II and complex IV  were upregulated concomitant with increased oxygen consumption in mitochondrial  respiration. Ectopic expression of inactive CA variants was sufficient to  complement the mutant phenotype. Data indicate that CA proteins are structurally  required for complex I assembly and that reproductive development is dependent on  the presence of complex I.', '2016 Jul', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/nph.13886', 'Peterhansel']
