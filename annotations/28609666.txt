It is generally known that cyclic GMP widespread in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, is involved in essential cellular processes and stress signal transduction. However, in contrast to animals the knowledge about plant guanylyl cyclases (GCs) which catalyze the formation of cGMP from GTP is still quite obscure. Recent studies of plant GCs are focused on identification and functional analysis of a new family of membrane proteins called "moonlighting kinases with GC activity" with guanylyl cyclase catalytic center encapsulated within intracellular kinase domain. Here we report identification and characterization of plasma membrane receptor of peptide signaling molecules - HpPepR1 in Hippeastrum hybridum. Both bioinformatic analysis of amimo acid sequence and in vitro studies revealed that the protein can act as guanylyl cyclase. The predicted amino acid sequence contains highly conserved 14 aa-long search motif in the catalytic center of GCs from lower and higher eukaryotes. Here, we provide experimental evidence to show that the intracellular domain of HpPepR1 can generate cGMP in vitro. Moreover, it was shown that the accumulation of HpPepR1 transcript was sharply increased after Peyronellaea curtisii (=Phoma narcissi) fungal infection, whereas mechanical wounding has no influence on expression profile of studied gene. These results may indicate the participation of cGMP-dependent pathway in rapid, alarm plant reactions induced by pathogen infection.
