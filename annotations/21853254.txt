['21853254', 'The regulation of cell specification in plants is particularly important in  vascular development. The vascular system is comprised two differentiated tissue  types, the xylem and phloem, which form conductive elements for the transport of  water, nutrients and signaling molecules. A meristematic layer, the procambium,  is located between these two differentiated cell types and divides to initiate  vascular growth. We report the identification of a receptor-like kinase (RLK)  that is expressed in the vasculature. Histochemical analyses of mutants in this  kinase display an aberrant accumulation of highly lignified cells, typical of  xylem or fiber cells, within the phloem. In addition, phloem cells are sometimes  located adjacent to xylem cells in these mutants. We, therefore, named this RLK  XYLEM INTERMIXED WITH PHLOEM 1 (XIP1). Analyses of longitudinal profiles of xip1  mutant stems show malformed cell files, indicating defects in oriented cell  divisions or cell morphology. We propose that XIP1 prevents ectopic lignification  in phloem cells and is necessary to maintain the organization of cell files or  cell morphology in conductive elements.', '2012 Jan', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-011-1489-6', 'Tax']
