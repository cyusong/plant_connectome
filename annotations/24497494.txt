['24497494', 'RNA editing is a posttranscriptional process that covalently alters the sequence  of RNA molecules and plays important biological roles in both animals and land  plants. In flowering plants, RNA editing converts specific cytidine residues to  uridine in both plastid and mitochondrial transcripts. Previous studies  identified pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif-containing proteins as  site-specific recognition factors for cytidine targets in RNA sequences. However,  the regulatory mechanism underlying RNA editing was largely unknown. Here, we  report that protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase 1 (PPO1), an enzyme that catalyzes  protoporphyrinogen IX into protoporphyrin IX in the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic  pathway, plays an unexpected role in editing multiple sites of plastid RNA  transcripts, most of which encode subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase-like complex  (NDH), in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified multiple  organellar RNA editing factors (MORFs), including MORF2, MORF8, and MORF9, that  interact with PPO1. We found that two conserved motifs within the 22-aa region at  the N terminus of PPO1 are essential for its interaction with MORFs, its RNA  editing function, and subsequently, its effect on NDH activity. However,  transgenic plants lacking key domains for the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic activity  of PPO1 exhibit normal RNA editing. Furthermore, MORF2 and MORF9 interact with  three PPRs or related proteins required for editing of ndhB and ndhD sites. These  results reveal that the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic enzyme PPO1 is required for  plastid RNA editing, acting as a regulator that promotes the stability of MORF  proteins through physical interaction.', '2014 Feb 4', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1316183111', 'Lin']
