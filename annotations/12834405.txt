['12834405', 'Cryptochromes (CRYs) are blue/UV-A photoreceptors related to the DNA repair  enzyme DNA photolyase. They have been found in plants, animals and most recently  in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. Closely related to the Synechocystis  cryptochrome is the Arabidopsis gene At5g24850. Here, we show that the encoded  protein of At5g24850 binds flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). It has no  photolyase activity, and is likely to function as a photoreceptor. We have named  it At-cry3 to distinguish it from the other Arbabidopsis cryptochrome homologues  At-cry1 and At-cry2. At-cry3 carries an N-terminal sequence, which mediates  import into chloroplasts and mitochondria. Furthermore, we show that At-cry3  binds DNA. DNA binding was also demonstrated for the Synechocystis cryptochrome,  indicating that both photoreceptors could have similar modes of action. Based on  the finding of a new cryptochrome class in bacteria and plants, it has been  suggested that cryptochromes evolved before the divergence of eukaryotes and  prokaryotes. However, our phylogenetic analyses are also consistent with an  alternative explanation that the presence of cryptochromes in the plant nuclear  genome is the result of dual horizontal gene transfer. That is, CRY1 and CRY2  genes may originate from an endosymbiotic ancestor of modern-day  alpha-proteobacteria, while the CRY3 gene may originate from an endosymbiotic  ancestor of modern-day cyanobacteria.', '2003 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2003.01787.x', 'Batschauer']
