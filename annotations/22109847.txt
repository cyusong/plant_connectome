['22109847', 'Auxin regulates diverse molecular and physiological events at the cellular and  organismal levels during plant growth and development in response to  environmental stimuli. It acts either through distinct signaling pathways or in  concert with other growth hormones. Its biological functions are adjusted by  modulating biosynthesis, conjugate formation, and polar transport and  distribution. Several tryptophan-dependent and -independent auxin biosynthetic  pathways have been proposed. Recent studies have shown that a few flavin  monooxygenase enzymes contribute to the tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis.  Here, we show that activation of a flavin monooxygenase gene YUCCA7 (YUC7), which  belongs to the tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthetic pathway, enhances drought  resistance. An Arabidopsis activation-tagged mutant yuc7-1D exhibited phenotypic  changes similar to those observed in auxin-overproducing mutants, such as tall,  slender stems and curled, narrow leaves. Accordingly, endogenous levels of total  auxin were elevated in the mutant. The YUC7 gene was induced by drought,  primarily in the roots, in an abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent manner. The yuc7-1D  mutant was resistant to drought, and drought-responsive genes, such as RESPONSIVE  TO DESSICATION 29A (RD29A) and COLD-REGULATED 15A (COR15A), were up-regulated in  the mutant. Interestingly, whereas stomatal aperture and production of  osmoprotectants were not discernibly altered, lateral root growth was  significantly promoted in the yuc7-1D mutant when grown under drought conditions.  These observations support that elevation of auxin levels in the roots enhances  drought resistance possibly by promoting root growth.', '2012 May', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-011-1552-3', 'Park']
