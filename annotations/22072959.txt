['22072959', 'EDS1, PAD4, and SAG101 are common regulators of plant immunity against many  pathogens. EDS1 interacts with both PAD4 and SAG101 but direct interaction  between PAD4 and SAG101 has not been detected, leading to the suggestion that the  EDS1-PAD4 and EDS1-SAG101 complexes are distinct. We show that EDS1, PAD4, and  SAG101 are present in a single complex in planta. While this complex is  preferentially nuclear localized, it can be redirected to the cytoplasm in the  presence of an extranuclear form of EDS1. PAD4 and SAG101 can in turn, regulate  the subcellular localization of EDS1. We also show that the Arabidopsis genome  encodes two functionally redundant isoforms of EDS1, either of which can form  ternary complexes with PAD4 and SAG101. Simultaneous mutations in both EDS1  isoforms are essential to abrogate resistance (R) protein-mediated defense  against turnip crinkle virus (TCV) as well as avrRps4 expressing Pseudomonas  syringae. Interestingly, unlike its function as a PAD4 substitute in bacterial  resistance, SAG101 is required for R-mediated resistance to TCV, thus implicating  a role for the ternary complex in this defense response. However, only EDS1 is  required for HRT-mediated HR to TCV, while only PAD4 is required for SA-dependent  induction of HRT. Together, these results suggest that EDS1, PAD4 and SAG101 also  perform independent functions in HRT-mediated resistance.', '2011 Nov', 'PLoS Pathog', '10.1371/journal.ppat.1002318', 'Kachroo']
