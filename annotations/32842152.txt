In Arabidopsis, chromosomal double-strand breaks at meiosis are presumably catalyzed by two distinct SPO11 transesterases, AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2, together with M-TOPVIB. To clarify the roles of the SPO11 paralogs in rice, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to produce null biallelic mutants in OsSPO11-1, OsSPO11-2, and OsSPO11-4. Similar to Osspo11-1, biallelic mutations in the first exon of OsSPO11-2 led to complete panicle sterility. Conversely, all Osspo11-4 biallelic mutants were fertile. To generate segregating Osspo11-2 mutant lines, we developed a strategy based on dual intron targeting. Similar to Osspo11-1, the pollen mother cells of Osspo11-2 progeny plants showed an absence of bivalent formation at metaphase I, aberrant segregation of homologous chromosomes, and formation of non-viable tetrads. In contrast, the chromosome behavior in Osspo11-4 male meiocytes was indistinguishable from that in the wild type. While similar numbers of OsDMC1 foci were revealed by immunostaining in wild-type and Osspo11-4 prophase pollen mother cells (114 and 101, respectively), a surprisingly high number (85) of foci was observed in the sterile Osspo11-2 mutant, indicative of a divergent function between OsSPO11-1 and OsSPO11-2. This study demonstrates that whereas OsSPO11-1 and OsSPO11-2 are the likely orthologs of AtSPO11-1 and AtSPO11-2, OsSPO11-4 has no major role in wild-type rice meiosis.
