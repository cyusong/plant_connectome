['21779177', 'The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is an important regulator of plant  development and response to environmental stresses. In this study, we identified  two ABA overly sensitive mutant alleles in a gene encoding Auxin Response Factor2  (ARF2). The expression of ARF2 was induced by ABA treatment. The arf2 mutants  showed enhanced ABA sensitivity in seed germination and primary root growth. In  contrast, the primary root growth and seed germination of transgenic plants  over-expressing ARF2 are less inhibited by ABA than that of the wild type. ARF2  negatively regulates the expression of a homeodomain gene HB33, the expression of  which is reduced by ABA. Transgenic plants over-expressing HB33 are more  sensitive, while transgenic plants reducing HB33 by RNAi are more resistant to  ABA in the seed germination and primary root growth than the wild type. ABA  treatment altered auxin distribution in the primary root tips and made the  relative, but not absolute, auxin accumulation or auxin signal around quiescent  centre cells and their surrounding columella stem cells to other cells stronger  in arf2-101 than in the wild type. These results indicate that ARF2 and HB33 are  novel regulators in the ABA signal pathway, which has crosstalk with auxin signal  pathway in regulating plant growth.', '2011 Jul', 'PLoS Genet', '10.1371/journal.pgen.1002172', 'Gong']
