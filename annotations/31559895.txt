Salicylic acid (SA) is an important signaling hormone in plant immunity. It can be synthesized by either the phenylpropanoid pathway or the isochorismate pathway, but mutant studies of this have been scarce in other species than Arabidopsis. Here we identified a mutation that introduced a stop-codon early in the barley gene for isochorismate synthase (ICS). We found that homozygous <i>ics</i> plants wilted if not sprayed with 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, a precursor of phylloquinone, also synthesized via the isochorismate pathway. Interestingly, <i>ics</i> had unchanged SA, suggesting that the basal level of SA is synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway. Previous studies have failed seeing increased SA levels in barley after attack by the powdery mildew fungus, <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f.sp. <i>hordei</i> (<i>Bgh</i>), and indeed, we saw no changes in the interaction of <i>ics</i> with this fungus. Overall, we hope this mutant will be useful for other studies of SA in barley.
