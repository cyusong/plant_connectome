['17639078', 'Stomata are innovations of land plants that allow regulated gas exchange.  Stomatal precursor cells are produced by asymmetric cell division, and once  formed, signal their neighbors to inhibit the formation of stomatal precursors in  direct contact. We report a gene of Arabidopsis thaliana, EPIDERMAL PATTERNING  FACTOR 1 (EPF1) that encodes a small secretory peptide expressed in stomatal  cells and precursors and that controls stomatal patterning through regulation of  asymmetric cell division. EPF1 activity is dependent on the TOO MANY MOUTHS  receptor-like protein and ERECTA family receptor kinases, suggesting that EPF1  may provide a positional cue interpreted by these receptors.', '2007 Jul 15', 'Genes Dev', '10.1101/gad.1550707', 'Kakimoto']

EPF1: !encodes! small secretory peptide
EPF1: !regulates! asymmetric cell division
TOO MANY MOUTHS: !receives! EPF1 positional cue
ERECTA family: !receives! EPF1 positional cue
