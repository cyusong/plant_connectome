Melatonin is widely involved in plant growth and stress responses as a master regulator. Melatonin treatment alters the levels of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) and NO affects endogenous melatonin content. Melatonin and NO may induce various plant physiological behavior through interaction mechanism. However, the interactions between melatonin and NO in plants are largely unknown. The review presented the metabolism of endogenous melatonin and NO and their relationship in plants. The interactions between melatonin and NO in plant growth and development and responses to environmental stress were summarized. The molecular mechanisms of interaction between melatonin and NO in plants were also proposed.
