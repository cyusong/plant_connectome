<i>Fusarium</i> head blight (FHB), a devastating wheat disease, results in loss of yield and production of mycotoxins including deoxynivalenol (DON) in infected grains. DON is harmful to human and animal health and facilitates the spread of FHB symptoms. Its conversion into DON-3-glucoside (D3G) by UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) is correlated with FHB resistance, and only few gene members in wheat have been investigated. Here, <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> and DON-induced <i>TaUGT6</i> expression in the resistant cultivar Sumai 3 was cloned and characterized. TaUGT6::GFP was subcellularly located throughout cells. Purified TaUGT6 protein could convert DON into D3G to some extent <i>in vitro</i>. Transformation of <i>TaUGT6</i> into <i>Arabidopsis</i> increased root tolerance when grown on agar plates containing DON. Furthermore, <i>TaUGT6</i> overexpression in wheat showed improved resistance to <i>Fusarium</i> spread after <i>F</i>. <i>graminearum</i> inoculation. Overall, this study provides useful insight into a novel <i>UGT</i> gene for FHB resistance in wheat.
