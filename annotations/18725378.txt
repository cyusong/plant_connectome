Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) catalyses the hydrolysis of phospholipids into lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. Physiological studies have indicated that PLA(2) is involved in stomatal movement. However, genetic evidence of a role of PLA(2) in guard cell signalling has not yet been reported. To identify PLA(2) gene(s) that is (are) involved in light-induced stomatal opening, stomatal movement was examined in Arabidopsis thaliana plants in which the expression of PLA(2) isoforms was reduced or knocked-out. Light-induced stomatal opening in PLA(2)alpha knockout plants did not differ from wild-type plants. Plants in which PLA(2)beta was silenced by RNA interference exhibited delayed light-induced stomatal opening, and this phenotype was reversed by exogenous lysophospholipids, which are products of PLA(2). Stomatal opening in transgenic plants that over-expressed PLA(2)beta was faster than wild-type plants. The expression of PLA(2)beta was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of guard cells, and increased in response to light in the mature leaf. Aristolochic acid, which inhibits light-induced stomatal opening, inhibited the activity of purified PLA(2)beta. Collectively, these results provide evidence that PLA(2)beta is involved in light-induced stomatal opening in Arabidopsis.
