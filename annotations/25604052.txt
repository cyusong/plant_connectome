The effects of Ca(NO3)2, KF and okadaic acid (OA) on cell hydraulic responses to NaCl were examined in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type plants and compared with plants overexpressing plasma membrane intrinsic protein PIP2;5. Root treatment with 10 mM NaCl rapidly and sharply reduced cell hydraulic conductivity (L(p)) in the wild-type Arabidopsis plants, but had no effect on L(p) in Arabidopsis plants overexpressing PIP2;5, suggesting that changes in protein and aquaporin gene expression were among the initial targets responsible for the inhibition of L(p) by NaCl. The down-regulation of PIP transcripts after 1 h exposure to 10 mM NaCl was likely a significant factor in the reduction of L(p). The effect of NaCl on L(p) in the wild-type plants was abolished when the NaCl-treated roots were subsequently exposed to 5 mM KF, 5 mM Ca(NO3)2 and 5 µM OA. The reduction of L(p) by 5 mM KF could not be prevented by treatment with 5 mM Ca(NO3)2 in both wild-type and PIP2;5-overexpressing plants. However, 5 µM OA, which was added following NaCl or KF treatment, completely reversed L(p) within several minutes. The results provide evidence for high sensitivity of aquaporin-mediated water transport to relatively low NaCl concentrations and point to the phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation processes as those that are likely responsible for the protection of L(p) by fluoride and calcium treatments against the effects of NaCl.
