Dense vesicles (DVs) are Golgi-derived plant-specific carriers that mediate post-Golgi transport of seed storage proteins in angiosperms. How this process is regulated remains elusive. Here, we report a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, named glutelin precursor accumulation8 (gpa8) that abnormally accumulates 57-kDa proglutelins in the mature endosperm. Cytological analyses of the gpa8 mutant revealed that proglutelin-containing DVs were mistargeted to the apoplast forming electron-dense aggregates and paramural bodies in developing endosperm cells. Differing from previously reported gpa mutants with post-Golgi trafficking defects, the gpa8 mutant showed bent Golgi bodies, defective trans-Golgi network (TGN), and enlarged DVs, suggesting a specific role of GPA8 in DV biogenesis. We demonstrated that GPA8 encodes a subunit E isoform 1 of vacuolar H+-ATPase (OsVHA-E1) that mainly localizes to TGN and the tonoplast. Further analysis revealed that the luminal pH of the TGN and vacuole is dramatically increased in the gpa8 mutant. Moreover, the colocalization of GPA1 and GPA3 with TGN marker protein in gpa8 protoplasts was obviously decreased. Our data indicated that OsVHA-E1 is involved in endomembrane luminal pH homeostasis, as well as maintenance of Golgi morphology and TGN required for DV biogenesis and subsequent protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells.
