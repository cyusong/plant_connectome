Inorganic polyphosphate (poly P) has been considered to be a translocatable form of phosphate (Pi) in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Here we examined time-course changes in poly P content during the AMF colonization process. Onion (Allium cepa) plants were cultured with or without inoculation with Gigaspora margarita for 2-8 wk with periodic sampling. Poly P in the extracts, purified through gel filtration, was quantified by the reverse reaction of polyphosphate kinase. The length of poly P in mycorrhizal roots appeared to be shorter than in extraradical hyphae or in spores of the AMF, indicating that AMF depolymerize poly P before providing Pi to the host. The poly P content increased as colonization proceeded, and was highly correlated with the weight of the colonized roots. These results support the model that AMF supply Pi to the host through the poly P pool, and that the poly P content of a mycorrhizal root can be a good indicator of the Pi-supplying activity of AMF.
