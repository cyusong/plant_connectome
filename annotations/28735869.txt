['28735869', "Although DWD HYPERSENSITIVE TO UV-B 1 (DHU1) is reported to be a negative  regulator in UV-B mediated cellular responses, its detailed role in UV-B  signaling is still elusive. To further understand the action mechanism of DHU1 in  UV-B response, physical and genetic interactions of DHU1 with various UV-B  signaling components were investigated. Yeast two hybrid assay results suggested  that DHU1 directly interacts with COP1 and RUP1, implying a functional connection  with both COP1 and RUP1. In spite of the physical association between DHU1 and  COP1, loss of DHU1 did not affect protein stability of COP1. Epistatic analysis  showed that the functional loss of both DHU1 and UVR8 leads to alleviation of  UV-B hypersensitivity displayed in dhu1-1. Moreover, phenotypic studies with  dhu1-1 cop1-6 and dhu1-1 hy5-215 revealed that COP1 and HY5 are epistatic to  DHU1, indicating that UV-B hypersensitivity of dhu1-1 requires both COP1 and HY5.  In the case of dhu1-1 rup1-1, UV-B responsiveness was similar to that of both  dhu1-1 and rup1-1, implying that DHU1 and RUP1 are required for each other's  function. Collectively, these results show that the role of DHU1 as a negative  regulator in UV-B response may be derived from its direct interaction with COP1  by sequestering COP1 from the active UVR8-COP1 complex, resulting in a decrease  in the COP1 population that positively participates in UV-B signaling together  with UVR8. Furthermore, this inhibitory role of DHU1 in UV-B signaling is likely  to be functionally connected to RUP1. This study will serve as a platform to  further understand more detailed action mechanism of DHU1 in UV-B response and  DHU1-mediated core UV-B signaling in Arabidopsis.", '2017 Sep 16', 'Biochem Biophys Res Commun', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.07.110', 'Lee']
