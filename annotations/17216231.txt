Plants respond differently to damage by different herbivorous insects. We speculated that sibling herbivorous species with different host ranges might also influence plant responses differently. Such differences may be associated with the diet breadth (specialization) of herbivores within a feeding guild, and the specialist may cause less intensive plant responses than the generalist. The tobacco Nicotinana tabacum L. is the common host plant of a generalist Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) and a specialist H. assulta Guenée (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae). The induced responses of tobacco to feeding of these two noctuid herbivores and mechanical wounding were compared. The results showed that the feeding of the specialist H. assulta and the generalist H. armigera resulted in the same inducible defensive system, but response intensity of plants was different to these two species. Inductions of jasmonic acid (JA), lipoxygenase (LOX), and proteinase inhibitors (PIs) were not significantly different concerning these two species, but H. assulta caused the less intensive foliar polyphenol oxidase (PPO) increase, more intensive nicotine and peroxidase (POD) increases in tobacco than H. armigera. The defensive response of plant to herbivores with different diet breadth seems to be more complicated than we expected, and the specialist does not necessarily cause less intensive plant responses than the generalist.
