The leaf economics spectrum (LES) is an ecophysiological concept describing the trade-offs of leaf structural and physiological traits, and has been widely investigated on multiple scales. However, the effects of the breeding process on the LES in crops, as well as the mechanisms of the trait trade-offs underlying the LES, have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, a dataset that included leaf anatomical, biochemical, and functional traits was constructed to evaluate the trait covariations and trade-offs in domesticated species, namely rice (Oryza species). The slopes and intercepts of the major bivariate correlations of the leaf traits in rice were significantly different from the global LES dataset (Glopnet), which is based on multiple non-crop species in natural ecosystems, although the general patterns were similar. The photosynthetic traits responded differently to leaf structural and biochemical changes, and mesophyll conductance was the most sensitive to leaf nitrogen (N) status. A further analysis revealed that the relative limitation of mesophyll conductance declined with leaf N content; however, the limitation of the biochemistry increased relative to leaf N content. These findings indicate that breeding selection and high-resource agricultural environments lead crops to deviate from the leaf trait covariation in wild species, and future breeding to increase the photosynthesis of rice should primarily focus on improvement of the efficiency of photosynthetic enzymes.
