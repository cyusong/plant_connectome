['21102469', 'The aromatic amino acids L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine and their plant-derived  natural products are essential in human and plant metabolism and physiology. Here  we identified Petunia hybrida and Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding prephenate  aminotransferases (PPA-ATs), thus completing the identification of the genes  involved in phenylalanine and tyrosine biosyntheses. Biochemical and genetic  characterization of enzymes showed that PPA-AT directs carbon flux from  prephenate toward arogenate, making the arogenate pathway predominant in plant  phenylalanine biosynthesis.', '2011 Jan', 'Nat Chem Biol', '10.1038/nchembio.485', 'Dudareva']
