Lead (Pb) is a heavy metal pollutant and negatively affects agriculture and ecosystems. Pb can cause oxidative stress and abnormal plant growth. The ascorbic acid-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle mainly exists in chloroplasts and resists oxidative stress, scavenges reactive oxygen radicals, and maintains normal photosynthesis. However, the dosage related effects of Pb on pakchoi photosynthesis, <i>via</i> oxidative stress and the AsA-GSH system, remains unclear. In this study, various Pb dosage stress models were tested (low: 300 mg/kg; medium: 600 mg/kg; high: 900 mg/kg). Pb stress induced a dose-dependent increase in Pb content in pakchoi leaves (P < 0.05). Principal component analysis showed that Se, B, and Pb were significantly and negatively correlated. Pb stress also increased MDA content and decreased antioxidant enzymes SOD, GSH-Px, and T-AOC activities (P < 0.05). We also found that Vc content, as well as the GSH/GSSG ratio, decreased. Additionally, Pb stress destroyed chloroplast structure, decreased photosynthesis indicators Pn, Tr, Gs, Ci and VPD, and attenuated Fv/Fm and Fv/Fo (P < 0.05). In the high-dose group, the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids decreased significantly, while the expression of chloroplast development genes (GLK, GLN2) decreased (P < 0.05). Our data suggest that Pb stress leads to dosage-dependent, aberrant photosynthesis by inhibiting the AsA-GSH system in pakchoi. This study expands the Pb toxicology research field and provides indications for screening antagonists.
