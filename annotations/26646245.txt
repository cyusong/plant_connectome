Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) infections affect many Arabidopsis developmental traits. This paper analyzes, at different levels, the development-related differential alterations induced by different strains of TuMV, represented by isolates UK 1 and JPN 1. The genomic sequence of JPN 1 TuMV isolate revealed highest divergence in the P1 and P3 viral cistrons, upon comparison with the UK 1 sequence. Infectious viral chimeras covering the whole viral genome uncovered the P3 cistron as a major viral determinant of development alterations, excluding the involvement of the PIPO open reading frame. However, constitutive transgenic expression of P3 in Arabidopsis did not induce developmental alterations nor modulate the strong effects induced by the transgenic RNA silencing suppressor HC-Pro from either strain. This highlights the importance of studying viral determinants within the context of actual viral infections. Transcriptomic and interactomic analyses at different stages of plant development revealed large differences in the number of genes affected by the different infections at medium infection times but no significant differences at very early times. Biological functions affected by UK 1 (the most severe strain) included mainly stress response and transport. Most cellular components affected cell-wall transport or metabolism. Hubs in the interactome were affected upon infection.
