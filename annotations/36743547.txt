Drought substantially influences crop growth and development. NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factors (TFs) have received much attention for their critical roles in drought stress responses. To explore the maize NAC genes in response to drought stress, the transcriptome sequencing data of NAC TFs in two maize inbred lines, the drought tolerance line H082183 and the sensitive line Lv28, were used to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). There were 129 maize NAC protein-coding genes identified, of which 15 and 20 NAC genes were differentially expressed between the two genotypes under MD and SD treatments, respectively. Meanwhile, the phylogenetic relationship of 152 non-redundant NAC family TFs in maize was generated. The maize NAC family proteins were grouped into 13 distinct subfamilies. Five drought stress-responsive NAC family members, which were designed as ZmNAP, ZmNAC19, ZmNAC4, ZmJUB1(JUBGBRUNNEN1), and ZmNAC87, were selected for further study. The expression of <i>ZmNAP</i>, <i>ZmNAC19</i>, <i>ZmNAC4</i>, <i>ZmJUB1</i>, and <i>ZmNAC87</i> were significantly induced by drought, dehydration, polyethylene glycol (PEG) stress, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. The overexpressing <i>Arabidopsis</i> of these five NAC genes was generated for functional characterization, respectively. Under different concentrations of NaCl, D-mannitol stress, and ABA treatments, the sensitivity of <i>ZmNAP-</i>, <i>ZmNAC19-</i>, <i>ZmNAC4-</i>, <i>ZmJUB1-</i>, and <i>ZmNAC87-</i>overexpressing lines was significantly increased at the germination stage compared to the wild-type lines. The overexpression of these five NAC members significantly improved the drought stress tolerance in transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Yeast two-hybrid screening analysis revealed that ZmNAP may cooperatively interact with 11 proteins including ZmNAC19 to activate the drought stress response. The above results inferred that <i>ZmNAP</i>, <i>ZmNAC19</i>, <i>ZmNAC4</i>, <i>ZmJUB1</i>, and <i>ZmNAC87</i> may play important roles in the plant response to drought stress and may be useful in bioengineering breeding and drought tolerance improvement.
