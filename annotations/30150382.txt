DNA methylation functions in gene silencing and the maintenance of genome integrity. In plants, non-CG DNA methylation is linked through a self-reinforcing loop with histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2). The plant-specific SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION 3-9 HOMOLOG (SUVH) family H3K9 methyltransferases (MTases) bind to DNA methylation marks and catalyze H3K9 methylation. Here, we analyzed the structure and function of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> SUVH6 to understand how this class of enzyme maintains methylation patterns in the genome. We reveal that SUVH6 has a distinct 5-methyl-dC (5mC) base-flipping mechanism involving a thumb loop element. Autoinhibition of H3 substrate entry is regulated by a SET domain loop, and a conformational transition in the post-SET domain upon cofactor binding may control catalysis. In vitro DNA binding and in vivo ChIP-seq data reveal that the different SUVH family H3K9 MTases have distinct DNA binding preferences, targeting H3K9 methylation to sites with different methylated DNA sequences, explaining the context biased non-CG DNA methylation in plants.
