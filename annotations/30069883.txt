Five TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1)/CENTRORADIALIS (CEN)-like genes were isolated and characterized from rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). All genes, except HbCEN1, were found to have conserved genomic organization, characteristic of the phosphatidyl ethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family. Overexpression of all of them delayed flowering and altered flower architecture compared with the wild-type (wt) counterpart. In addition, as premature-flowering of the terminal bud was successfully overcome in the tfl1-1 mutant of Arabidopsis, all these genes have a potential function similar to TFL1. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed higher expressions of HbCEN1 and HbCEN2 in the shoot apices and stems of both immature and mature rubber trees than in reproductive organs. HbTFL1-1 and HbTFL1-2 expression was confined to roots of 3-month-old seedlings and HbTFL1-3 was significantly higher in the shoot apices of these seedlings. These results suggested that HbCEN1 and HbCEN2 could be associated with the development of vegetative growth, whereas HbTFL1-1, HbTFL1-2 and HbTFL1-3 seem to be mainly related with maintenance of juvenility. In addition, four of the five genes displayed variable diurnal expression, HbTFL1-1 and HbTFL1-3 being mainly expressed during the night whereas HbCEN1 and HbCEN2 showed irregular diurnal rhythms.
