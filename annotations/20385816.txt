['20385816', 'In response to drought stress, the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) induces  stomatal closure. Thereby the stress hormone activates guard cell anion channels  in a calcium-dependent, as well as -independent, manner. Open stomata 1 protein  kinase (OST1) and ABI1 protein phosphatase (ABA insensitive 1) represent key  components of calcium-independent ABA signaling. Recently, the guard cell anion  channel SLAC1 was identified. When expressed heterologously SLAC1 remained  electrically silent. Upon coexpression with Ca(2+)-independent OST1, however,  SLAC1 anion channels appear activated in an ABI1-dependent manner. Mutants  lacking distinct calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) appeared impaired in  ABA stimulation of guard cell ion channels, too. To study SLAC1 activation via  the calcium-dependent ABA pathway, we studied the SLAC1 response to CPKs in the  Xenopus laevis oocyte system. Split YFP-based protein-protein interaction assays,  using SLAC1 as the bait, identified guard cell expressed CPK21 and 23 as major  interacting partners. Upon coexpression of SLAC1 with CPK21 and 23, anion  currents document SLAC1 stimulation by these guard cell protein kinases.  Ca(2+)-sensitive activation of SLAC1, however, could be assigned to the CPK21  pathway only because CPK23 turned out to be rather Ca(2+)-insensitive. In line  with activation by OST1, CPK activation of the guard cell anion channel was  suppressed by ABI1. Thus the CPK and OST1 branch of ABA signal transduction in  guard cells seem to converge on the level of SLAC1 under the control of the  ABI1/ABA-receptor complex.', '2010 Apr 27', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0912030107', 'Hedrich']
