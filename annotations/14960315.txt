['14960315', 'Precise regulation of calcium transporters is essential for modulating the Ca2+  signaling network that is involved in the growth and adaptation of all organisms.  The Arabidopsis H+/Ca2+ antiporter, CAX1, is a high capacity and low affinity  Ca2+ transporter and several CAX1-like transporters are found in Arabidopsis.  When heterologously expressed in yeast, CAX1 is unable to suppress the Ca2+  hypersensitivity of yeast vacuolar Ca2+ transporter mutants due to an N-terminal  autoinhibition mechanism that prevents Ca2+ transport. Using a yeast screen, we  have identified CAX nteracting Protein 4 (CXIP4) that activated full-length CAX1,  but not full-length CAX2, CAX3 or CAX4. CXIP4 encodes a novel plant protein with  no bacterial, fungal, animal, or mammalian homologs. Expression of a GFP-CXIP4  fusion in yeast and plant cells suggests that CXIP4 is targeted predominantly to  the nucleus. Using a yeast growth assay, CXIP4 activated a chimeric CAX construct  that contained specific portions of the N-terminus of CAX1. Together with other  recent studies, these results suggest that CAX1 is regulated by several signaling  molecules that converge on the N-terminus of CAX1 to regulate H+/Ca2+ antiport.', '2004 Feb 13', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/S0014-5793(04)00036-5', 'Hirschi']
