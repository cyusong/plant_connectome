['10758475', 'Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS; EC4.2.1.52) catalyses the first reaction of  lysine biosynthesis in plants and bacteria. Plant DHDPS enzymes are strongly  inhibited by lysine (I0.5 approximately 10 microM), whereas the bacterial enzymes  are less (50-fold) or insensitive to lysine inhibition. We found that plant dhdps  sequences expressing lysine-sensitive DHDPS enzymes are unable to complement a  bacterial auxotroph, although a functional plant DHDPS enzyme is formed. As a  consequence of this, plant dhdps cDNA clones which have been isolated through  functional complementation using the DHDPS-deficient Escherichia coli strain  encode mutated DHDPS enzymes impaired in lysine inhibition. The experiments  outlined in this article emphasize that heterologous complementation can select  for mutant clones when altered protein properties are requisite for functional  rescue. In addition, the mutants rescued by heterologous complementation revealed  a new critical amino acid substitution which renders lysine insensitivity to the  plant DHDPS enzyme. An interpretation is given for the impaired inhibition  mechanism of the mutant DHDPS enzyme by integrating the identified amino acid  substitution in the DHDPS protein structure.', '2000 Feb', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00668.x', 'Jacobs']
