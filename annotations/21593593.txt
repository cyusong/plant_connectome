Stomatal movement is strictly regulated by various intracellular and extracellular factors in response environmental signals. In our recent study, we found that an Arabidopsis guard cell expressed expansin, AtEXPA1, regulates stomatal opening by altering the structure of the guard cell wall. This addendum proposes a mechanism by which guard cell expansins regulate stomatal movement.

AtEXPA1: !regulates! stomatal opening 
AtEXPA1: !alters! guard cell wall structure 
environmental signals: !influence! AtEXPA1 
guard cell expansins: !regulate! stomatal movement
