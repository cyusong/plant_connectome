To understand plant molecular networks of glucosinolate metabolism, perturbation of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis was established using inducible RNA interference (RNAi) in Arabidopsis. Two RNAi lines were chosen for examining global protein and metabolite changes using complementary proteomics and metabolomics approaches. Proteins involved in metabolism including photosynthesis and hormone metabolism, protein binding, energy, stress, and defense showed marked responses to glucosinolate perturbation. In parallel, metabolomics revealed major changes in the levels of amino acids, carbohydrates, peptides, and hormones. The metabolomics data were correlated with the proteomics results and revealed intimate molecular connections between cellular pathways/processes and glucosinolate metabolism. This study has provided an unprecedented view of the molecular networks of glucosinolate metabolism and laid a foundation towards rationale glucosinolate engineering for enhanced defense and quality.
