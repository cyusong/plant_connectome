['27440755', 'Although cold acclimation is a key process in plants from temperate climates, the  mechanisms sensing low temperature remain obscure. Here, we show that the  accumulation of the organic acid fumaric acid, mediated by the cytosolic fumarase  FUM2, is essential for cold acclimation of metabolism in the cold-tolerant model  species Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). A nontargeted metabolomic approach,  using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, identifies fumarate as a key  component of the cold response in this species. Plants of T-DNA insertion  mutants, lacking FUM2, show marked differences in their response to cold, with  contrasting responses both in terms of metabolite concentrations and gene  expression. The fum2 plants accumulated higher concentrations of phosphorylated  sugar intermediates and of starch and malate. Transcripts for proteins involved  in photosynthesis were markedly down-regulated in fum2.2 but not in wild-type  Columbia-0. Plants of fum2 show a complete loss of the ability to acclimate  photosynthesis to low temperature. We conclude that fumarate accumulation plays  an essential role in low temperature sensing in Arabidopsis, either indirectly  modulating metabolic or redox signals or possibly being itself directly involved  in cold sensing.', '2016 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.16.00852', 'ORCID:']
