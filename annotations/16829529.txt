['16829529', 'Glutaredoxins (Grxs) are ubiquitous small heat-stable disulfide oxidoreductases  and members of the thioredoxin (Trx) fold protein family. In bacterial, yeast,  and mammalian cells, Grxs appear to be involved in maintaining cellular redox  homeostasis. However, in plants, the physiological roles of Grxs have not been  fully characterized. Recently, an emerging subgroup of Grxs with one cysteine  residue in the putative active motif (monothiol Grxs) has been identified but not  well characterized. Here we demonstrate that a plant protein, AtGRXcp, is a  chloroplast-localized monothiol Grx with high similarity to yeast Grx5. In yeast  expression assays, AtGRXcp localized to the mitochondria and suppressed the  sensitivity of yeast grx5 cells to H2O2 and protein oxidation. AtGRXcp expression  can also suppress iron accumulation and partially rescue the lysine auxotrophy of  yeast grx5 cells. Analysis of the conserved monothiol motif suggests that the  cysteine residue affects AtGRXcp expression and stability. In planta, AtGRXcp  expression was elevated in young cotyledons, green tissues, and vascular bundles.  Analysis of atgrxcp plants demonstrated defects in early seedling growth under  oxidative stresses. In addition, atgrxcp lines displayed increased protein  carbonylation within chloroplasts. Thus, this work describes the initial  functional characterization of a plant monothiol Grx and suggests a conserved  biological function in protecting cells against protein oxidative damage.', '2006 Sep 8', 'J Biol Chem', '10.1074/jbc.M601354200', 'Hirschi']
