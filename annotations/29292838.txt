There is a spectacular variability in trichome types and densities and trichome metabolites across species, but the functional implications of this variability in protecting from atmospheric oxidative stresses remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible protective role of glandular and non-glandular trichomes against ozone stress. We investigated the interspecific variation in types and density of trichomes and how these traits were associated with elevated ozone impacts on visible leaf damage, net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and emissions of lipoxygenase pathway products in 24 species with widely varying trichome characteristics and taxonomy. Both peltate and capitate glandular trichomes played a critical role in reducing leaf ozone uptake, but no impact of non-glandular trichomes was observed. Across species, the visible ozone damage varied 10.1-fold, reduction in net assimilation rate 3.3-fold, and release of lipoxygenase compounds 14.4-fold, and species with lower glandular trichome density were more sensitive to ozone stress and more vulnerable to ozone damage compared to species with high glandular trichome density. These results demonstrate that leaf surface glandular trichomes constitute a major factor in reducing ozone toxicity and function as a chemical barrier that neutralizes the ozone before it enters the leaf.
