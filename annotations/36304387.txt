Volatile compounds such as ethanol released from fruit can be rapidly detected using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy based on a long-path gas cell. However, this method relies on a long optical path length and requires pumping fruit volatiles into the gas cell. This can lead to the volatile compounds being contaminated and not detectable <i>in situ</i>. Fiber optic evanescent wave spectroscopy (FOEW) is not influenced by the path length so can detect materials (solid, liquid and gas phase) rapidly <i>in situ</i>, using only a few millimeters of optical fiber. In the present study, a spiral silver halide FOEW sensor with a length of approximately 21 mm was used to replace a long-path gas cell to explore the feasibility of identifying volatile compounds released from grapes <i>in situ</i>. The absorption peaks of ethanol in the volatile compounds were clearly found in the FOEW spectra and their intensity gradually increased as the storage time of the grapes increased. PCA analysis of these spectra showed clear clustering at different storage times (1-3, 4-5 and 6-7 d), revealing that the concentration of the ethanol released from the grapes changed significantly with time. The qualitative model established by PLS-DA algorithm could accurately classify grape samples as "Fresh," "Slight spoilage," or "Severe spoilage". The accuracy of the calibration and validation sets both were 100.00%. These changes can therefore be used for rapidly identifying fruit deterioration. Compared with the method used in a previous study by the authors, this method avoids using a pumping process and can thus identify volatile compounds and hence monitor deterioration <i>in situ</i> and on-line by placing a very short optical fiber near the fruit.
