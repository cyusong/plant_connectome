['20079334', 'Plants are highly sensitive to temperature and can perceive a difference of as  little as 1 degrees C. How temperature is sensed and integrated in development is  unknown. In a forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis, we have found that  nucleosomes containing the alternative histone H2A.Z are essential to perceiving  ambient temperature correctly. Genotypes deficient in incorporating H2A.Z into  nucleosomes phenocopy warm grown plants, and show a striking constitutive warm  temperature transcriptome. We show that nucleosomes containing H2A.Z display  distinct responses to temperature in vivo, independently of transcription. Using  purified nucleosomes, we are able to show that H2A.Z confers distinct  DNA-unwrapping properties on nucleosomes, indicating a direct mechanism for the  perception of temperature through DNA-nucleosome fluctuations. Our results show  that H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes provide thermosensory information that is used  to coordinate the ambient temperature transcriptome. We observe the same effect  in budding yeast, indicating that this is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism.', '2010 Jan 8', 'Cell', '10.1016/j.cell.2009.11.006', 'Wigge']
