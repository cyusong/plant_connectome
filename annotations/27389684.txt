We examined whether variations in photosynthetic capacity are linked to variations in the environment and/or associated leaf traits for tropical moist forests (TMFs) in the Andes/western Amazon regions of Peru. We compared photosynthetic capacity (maximal rate of carboxylation of Rubisco (V<sub>cmax</sub> ), and the maximum rate of electron transport (J<sub>max</sub> )), leaf mass, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) per unit leaf area (M<sub>a</sub> , N<sub>a</sub> and P<sub>a</sub> , respectively), and chlorophyll from 210 species at 18 field sites along a 3300-m elevation gradient. Western blots were used to quantify the abundance of the CO<sub>2</sub> -fixing enzyme Rubisco. Area- and N-based rates of photosynthetic capacity at 25°C were higher in upland than lowland TMFs, underpinned by greater investment of N in photosynthesis in high-elevation trees. Soil [P] and leaf P<sub>a</sub> were key explanatory factors for models of area-based V<sub>cmax</sub> and J<sub>max</sub> but did not account for variations in photosynthetic N-use efficiency. At any given N<sub>a</sub> and P<sub>a</sub> , the fraction of N allocated to photosynthesis was higher in upland than lowland species. For a small subset of lowland TMF trees examined, a substantial fraction of Rubisco was inactive. These results highlight the importance of soil- and leaf-P in defining the photosynthetic capacity of TMFs, with variations in N allocation and Rubisco activation state further influencing photosynthetic rates and N-use efficiency of these critically important forests.
