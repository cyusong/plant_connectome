Plant metabolism research has experienced a second golden age resulting from synergies between genome-enabled technologies and classical biochemistry. The rapid rate at which genomics data are being accumulated creates increased needs for robust metabolomic technologies and fast and accurate methods for identifying the activities of enzymes.
