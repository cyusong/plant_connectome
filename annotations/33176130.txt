In both animals and plants, development involves anatomical modifications. In the root of Arabidopsis thaliana, maturation of the ground tissue (GT)-a tissue comprising all cells between epidermal and vascular ones-is a paradigmatic example of these modifications, as it generates an additional tissue layer, the middle cortex (MC).<sup>1-4</sup> In early post-embryonic phases, the Arabidopsis root GT is composed of one layer of endodermis and one of cortex. A second cortex layer, the MC, is generated by asymmetric cell divisions in about 80% of Arabidopsis primary roots, in a time window spanning from 7 to 14 days post-germination (dpg). The cell cycle regulator CYCLIN D6;1 (CYCD6;1) plays a central role in this process, as its accumulation in the endodermis triggers the formation of MC.<sup>5</sup> The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) is a key regulator of the timing of MC formation, as alterations in its signaling and homeostasis result in precocious endodermal asymmetric cell divisions.<sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>6</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>7</sup> However, little is known on how GAs are regulated during GT maturation. Here, we show that the HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER III (HD-ZIPIII) transcription factor PHABULOSA (PHB) is a master regulator of MC formation, controlling the accumulation of CYCD6;1 in the endodermis in a cell non-autonomous manner. We show that PHB activates the GA catabolic gene GIBBERELLIN 2 OXIDASE 2 (GA2ox2) in the vascular tissue, thus regulating the stability of the DELLA protein GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE (GAI)-a GA signaling repressor-in the root and, hence, CYCD6;1 expression in the endodermis.
