We examined metabolic profiles of acetone and butanol extracts obtained from the leaves of 18 seedlings of the Bulgarian wine-making cultivar Storgozia. The acetone extracts contained the components from the leaf surface, while the butanol extracts were enriched with polar components from inside the leaf tissue. The leaves displayed different degrees of resistance and susceptibility to the etiological agent downy mildew, Plasmopara viticola. Based on the statistically significant correlations (P<0.05) between the GC-MS data of the identified metabolites and the estimated leaf resistances, 10 individual components were proposed as possible biomarkers for the downy mildew resistance and susceptibility in grapevine. All were found in the butanol extracts, and can be considered to form two groups: compounds with high correlations (r=+/-0.50 to +/-1.00) - 3-hydroxybutanoic acid, 2,3,4-trihydroxybutanoic acid, 2,3,4-trihydroxybutanoic acid (isomer), hexadecanoic acid, 3-hydroxyhexanoic acid and myo-inositol, and compounds with moderate correlations (r=+/-0.30 to +/-0.49) hydroxybutanedioic acid, alanine, glutamine, arabinoic acid and aldohexoses. Among them, the more polar compounds were related to sensitivity, and only hexadecanoic and the monohydroxycarboxylic acids were related to resistance in grapevine.
