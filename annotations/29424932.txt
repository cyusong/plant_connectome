The impacts of rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on plant disease have received increasing attention, but with little consensus emerging on the direct mechanisms by which CO<sub>2</sub> shapes plant immunity. Furthermore, the impact of sub-ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, which plants have experienced repeatedly over the past 800 000 yr, has been largely overlooked. A combination of gene expression analysis, phenotypic characterisation of mutants and mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling was used to determine development-independent effects of sub-ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (saCO<sub>2</sub> ) and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub> ) on Arabidopsis immunity. Resistance to the necrotrophic Plectosphaerella cucumerina (Pc) was repressed at saCO<sub>2</sub> and enhanced at eCO<sub>2</sub> . This CO<sub>2</sub> -dependent resistance was associated with priming of jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent gene expression and required intact JA biosynthesis and signalling. Resistance to the biotrophic oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) increased at both eCO<sub>2</sub> and saCO<sub>2</sub> . Although eCO<sub>2</sub> primed salicylic acid (SA)-dependent gene expression, mutations affecting SA signalling only partially suppressed Hpa resistance at eCO<sub>2</sub> , suggesting additional mechanisms are involved. Induced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) at saCO<sub>2</sub> corresponded to a loss of resistance in glycolate oxidase mutants and increased transcription of the peroxisomal catalase gene CAT2, unveiling a mechanism by which photorespiration-derived ROS determined Hpa resistance at saCO<sub>2</sub> . By separating indirect developmental impacts from direct immunological effects, we uncover distinct mechanisms by which CO<sub>2</sub> shapes plant immunity and discuss their evolutionary significance.
