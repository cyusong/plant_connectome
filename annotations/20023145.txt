Oxidative injury of the root elongation zone is a primary event in aluminum (Al) toxicity in plants, but the injuring species remain unidentified. We verified the hypothesis that lipid peroxide-derived aldehydes, especially highly electrophilic alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes (2-alkenals), participate in Al toxicity. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) overexpressing Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) 2-alkenal reductase (AER-OE plants), wild-type SR1, and an empty vector-transformed control line (SR-Vec) were exposed to AlCl(3) on their roots. Compared with the two controls, AER-OE plants suffered less retardation of root elongation under AlCl(3) treatment and showed more rapid regrowth of roots upon Al removal. Under AlCl(3) treatment, the roots of AER-OE plants accumulated Al and H(2)O(2) to the same levels as did the sensitive controls, while they accumulated lower levels of aldehydes and suffered less cell death than SR1 and SR-Vec roots. In SR1 roots, AlCl(3) treatment markedly increased the contents of the highly reactive 2-alkenals acrolein, 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-hexenal, and 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-nonenal and other aldehydes such as malondialdehyde and formaldehyde. In AER-OE roots, accumulation of these aldehydes was significantly less. Growth of the roots exposed to 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-nonenal and (E)-2-hexenal were retarded more in SR1 than in AER-OE plants. Thus, the lipid peroxide-derived aldehydes, formed downstream of reactive oxygen species, injured root cells directly. Their suppression by AER provides a new defense mechanism against Al toxicity.
