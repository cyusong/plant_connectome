['18278578', 'Throughout development the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem successively  undergoes several major phase transitions such as the juvenile-to-adult and  floral transitions until, finally, it will produce flowers instead of leaves and  shoots. Members of the Arabidopsis SBP-box gene family of transcription factors  have been implicated in promoting the floral transition in dependence of miR156  and, accordingly, transgenics constitutively over-expressing this microRNA are  delayed in flowering. To elaborate their roles in Arabidopsis shoot development,  we analysed two of the 11 miR156 regulated Arabidopsis SBP-box genes, i.e. the  likely paralogous genes SPL9 and SPL15. Single and double mutant phenotype  analysis showed these genes to act redundantly in controlling the  juvenile-to-adult phase transition. In addition, their loss-of-function results  in a shortened plastochron during vegetative growth, altered inflorescence  architecture and enhanced branching. In these aspects, the double mutant partly  phenocopies constitutive MIR156b over-expressing transgenic plants and thus a  major contribution to the phenotype of these transgenics as a result of the  repression of SPL9 and SPL15 is strongly suggested.', '2008 May', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-008-9310-z', 'Huijser']
