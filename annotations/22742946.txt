Enzymatic antioxidant system plays an important role in maintaining seed vigor and regulating plant growth and development. It involves a number of enzymes that scavenge excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during seed aging and also modulate the level of these compounds during plant developmental processes. This study investigated the transcriptional regulation of enzymatic antioxidative capacity in pea during the pre- and post-germinative phases and in response to seed aging by analyzing the spatio-temporal expression of five antioxidative genes: PsAPX, PsSOD, PsGRcyt, PsGRcm and PsCAT. Transcripts of all these genes were found in mature dry seeds, embryo axes and cotyledons of germinating seeds, and cotyledons, roots and shoots of young seedlings. However, PsAPX and PsSOD were predominant and exhibited developmental regulation, suggesting that these genes play important roles in controlling the intracellular homeostasis of ROS for promoting cell elongation, and thereby embryo axis expansion and early seedling growth in pea. Accelerated aging of pea seeds led to reduction in seed viability and seedling growth, and this effect was correlated with substantial decrease in the transcriptional activation of the prominent antioxidative genes. Furthermore, our proteomic analysis indicated the association of seed aging with changes in the abundance of specific proteins, revealing additional mechanisms underlying seed aging in pea.
