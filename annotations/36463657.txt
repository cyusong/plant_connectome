Protein kinases play crucial roles in the regulation of plant resistance to various stresses. In this work, we determined that GsSnRK1.1 was actively responsive to saline-alkali, drought, and abscisic acid (ABA) stresses by histochemical staining and qRT-PCR analyses. The wild-type GsSnRK1.1 but not the kinase-dead mutant, GsSnRK1.1(K49M), demonstrated in vitro kinase activity by phosphorylating GsABF2. Intriguingly, we found that GsSnRK1.1 could complement the loss of SNF1 kinase in yeast Msy1193 (-snf1) mutant, rescue growth defects of yeast cells on medium with glycerol as a carbon resource, and promote yeast resistance to NaCl or NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. To further elucidate GsSnRK1.1 function in planta, we knocked out SnRK1.1 gene from the Arabidopsis genome by the CRISPR/Cas9 approach, and then expressed GsSnRK1.1 and a series of mutants into snrk1.1-null lines. The transgenic Arabidopsis lines were subjected to various abiotic stress treatments. The results showed that GsSnRK1.1(T176E) mutant with enhanced protein kinase activity significantly promoted, but GsSnRK1.1(K49M) and GsSnRK1.1(T176A) mutants with disrupted protein kinase activity abrogated, plant stomatal closure and tolerance to abiotic stresses. In conclusion, this study provides the molecular clues to fully understand the physiological functions of plant SnRK1 protein kinases.
