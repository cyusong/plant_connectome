External physical and chemical stimuli are transduced via second messengers, following primary interaction with specific membrane or soluble receptors. Ca(2+) is an important second messenger in plants as in other eukaryotes, mediating responses to numerous environmental stimuli and affecting a multitude of cellular processes including gene expression. However, there is yet very little information concerning the cis-elements that mediate Ca(2+)-responsive gene expression. In this article we discuss a recent investigation combining bioinformatics with experimental data, revealing DNA regulatory elements that convey specific cytosolic Ca(2+) transients to the transcription machinery.
