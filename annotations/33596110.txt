How plants deal with beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms and how they can tolerate beneficial ones and face pathogens at the same time are questions that remain puzzling to plant biologists. Legume plants are good models to explore those issues, as their interactions with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia results in a drastic and easy-to-follow phenotype of nodulation. Intriguingly, despite massive and chronic infection, legume defense reactions are essentially suppressed during the whole symbiotic process, raising a question about a potential negative effect of plant immune responses on the establishment of nodulation. In the present study, we used the model legume, <i>Medicago truncatula</i>, coinoculated with mutualistic and phytopathogenic bacteria, <i>Sinorhizobium medicae</i> and <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i>, respectively. We show that the presence of <i>R. solanacearum</i> drastically inhibits the nodulation process. The type III secretion system of <i>R. solanacearum</i>, which is important for the inhibition of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), strongly contributes to inhibit nodulation. Thus, our results question the negative effect of PTI on nodulation. By including a pathogenic bacterium in the interaction system, our study provides a new angle to address the influence of the biotic environment on the nodulation process.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
