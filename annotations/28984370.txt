We propose a novel approach to determine the coefficient of CO<sub>2</sub> diffusional leakage (k<sub>_CO2</sub> ) in the chamber of a portable open gas exchange system (Li-6400, Li-Cor Inc., NE, USA) using intact leaves. Assuming that dark respiration rate (R<sub>n</sub> ) is constant at various CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, at least in a short term, k<sub>_CO2</sub> should be the value that makes the leak-corrected R<sub>n</sub> constant. We used 2 representative tree species native to northern Japan, Japanese white birch (Betula platyphylla var. japonica) and Japanese oak (Quercus mongolica var. crispula), to determine k<sub>_CO2</sub> , by measuring R<sub>n</sub> at various CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Irrespective of the species, k<sub>_CO2</sub> estimated by the present approach was well correlated with the diffusional leak coefficient (k<sub>_flow</sub> ) estimated by the generally used approach that utilizes CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations inside and outside the chamber based on thermally killed leaves at various flow rates. Furthermore, the present approach does not require the ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentration outside the chamber (C<sub>a</sub> ) if C<sub>a</sub> in the laboratory is stable, which provides a feasible way to correct the photosynthetic rate, taking diffusional leakage into account.
