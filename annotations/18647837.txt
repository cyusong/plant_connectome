['18647837', 'Photosynthesis, heme biosynthesis, and Fe-S cluster assembly all take place in  the chloroplast, and all require iron. Reduction of iron via a membrane-bound  Fe(III) chelate reductase is required before iron transport across membranes in a  variety of systems, but to date there has been no definitive genetic proof that  chloroplasts have such a reduction system. Here we report that one of the eight  members of the Arabidopsis ferric reductase oxidase (FRO) family, FRO7, localizes  to the chloroplast. Chloroplasts prepared from fro7 loss-of-function mutants have  75% less Fe(III) chelate reductase activity and contain 33% less iron per  microgram of chlorophyll than wild-type chloroplasts. This decreased iron content  is presumably responsible for the observed defects in photosynthetic electron  transport. When germinated in alkaline soil, fro7 seedlings show severe chlorosis  and die without setting seed unless watered with high levels of soluble iron.  Overall, our results provide molecular evidence that FRO7 plays a role in  chloroplast iron acquisition and is required for efficient photosynthesis in  young seedlings and for survival under iron-limiting conditions.', '2008 Jul 29', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.0708367105', 'Guerinot']
