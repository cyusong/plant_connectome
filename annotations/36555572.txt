Medicinal plants produce important substrates for their adaptation and defenses against environmental factors and, at the same time, are used for traditional medicine and industrial additives. Plants have relatively little in the way of secondary metabolites via biosynthesis. Recently, the whole-genome sequencing of medicinal plants and the identification of secondary metabolite production were revolutionized by the rapid development and cheap cost of sequencing technology. Advances in functional genomics, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, pave the way for discoveries in secondary metabolites and related key genes. The multi-omics approaches can offer tremendous insight into the variety, distribution, and development of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Although many reviews have reported on the plant and medicinal plant genome, chemistry, and pharmacology, there is no review giving a comprehensive report about the medicinal plant genome and multi-omics approaches to study the biosynthesis pathway of secondary metabolites. Here, we introduce the medicinal plant genome and the application of multi-omics tools for identifying genes related to the biosynthesis pathway of secondary metabolites. Moreover, we explore comparative genomics and polyploidy for gene family analysis in medicinal plants. This study promotes medicinal plant genomics, which contributes to the biosynthesis and screening of plant substrates and plant-based drugs and prompts the research efficiency of traditional medicine.
