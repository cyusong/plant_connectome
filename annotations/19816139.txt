Transmission of plant viruses is the result of interactions between a given virus, the host plant and the vector. Most research has focused on molecular and cellular virus-vector interactions, and the host has only been regarded as a reservoir from which the virus is acquired by the vector more or less accidentally. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the host can play a crucial role in transmission. Indeed, at least one virus, <i>Cauliflower mosaic virus</i>, exploits the host's cellular pathways to form specialized intracellular structures that optimize virus uptake by the vector and hence transmission.
