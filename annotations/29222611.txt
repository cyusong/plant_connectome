Genome-wide targets of Actinidia chinensis SVP2 confirm roles in ABA- and dehydration-mediated growth repression and reveal a conservation in mechanism of action between SVP genes of taxonomically distant Arabidopsis and a woody perennial kiwifruit. The molecular mechanisms underlying growth and dormancy in woody perennials are largely unknown. In Arabidopsis, the MADS-box transcription factor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) plays a key role in the progression from vegetative to floral development, and in woody perennials SVP-like genes are also proposed to be involved in controlling dormancy. During kiwifruit development SVP2 has a role in growth inhibition, with high-chill kiwifruit Actinidia deliciosa transgenic lines overexpressing SVP2 showing suppressed bud outgrowth. Transcriptomic analyses of these plants suggests that SVP2 mimics the well-documented abscisic acid (ABA) effect on the plant dehydration response. To corroborate the growth inhibition role of SVP2 in kiwifruit development at the molecular level, we analysed the genome-wide direct targets of SVP2 using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing in kiwifruit A. chinensis. SVP2 was found to bind to at least 297 target sites in the kiwifruit genome, and potentially modulates 252 genes that function in a range of biological processes, especially those involved in repressing meristem activity and ABA-mediated dehydration pathways. In addition, our ChIP-seq analysis reveals remarkable conservation in mechanism of action between SVP genes of taxonomically distant plant species.
