Bipolaris sorokiniana, one of the most devastating hemibiotrophic fungal pathogens, causes root rot, crown rot, leaf blotching, and black embryos of gramineous crops worldwide, posing a serious threat to global food security. However, the host-pathogen interaction mechanism between B. sorokiniana and wheat remains poorly understood. To facilitate related studies, we sequenced and assembled the genome of B. sorokiniana strain LK93. Nanopore long reads and next generation sequencing short reads were applied in the genome assembly, and the final 36.4 Mb genome assembly contains 16 contigs with the contig N50 of 2.3 Mb. Subsequently, we annotated 11,811 protein-coding genes including 10,620 functional genes, 258 of which were identified as secretory proteins including 211 predicted effectors. Additionally, the 111,581 bp mitogenome of LK93 was assembled and annotated. The LK93 genomes presented in this study will facilitate research in the B. sorokiniana-wheat pathosystem for better control crop diseases.
