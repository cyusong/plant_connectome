Widespread chaparral shrub mortality was observed during the peak of the drought in 2014. Some species were more impacted than others and shallow-rooted shrub species were the most vulnerable to drought-associated mortality. This type of drought represents what is termed an 'ecological drought' during which an ecosystem is driven beyond thresholds of vulnerability, triggering impairment of ecosystem services and feedbacks that may result in long-term type-conversion of natural communities. The ability of shrublands to recover will depend on the timing, intensity and seasonality of future extreme climate events, post-fire recruitment potential of species with obligate fire-associated recruitment, and interactions with other stresses.
