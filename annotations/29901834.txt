Prenylquinols (tocochromanols and plastoquinols) serve as efficient physical and chemical quenchers of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> ) formed during high light stress in higher plants. Although quenching of <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> by prenylquinols has been previously studied, direct evidence for chemical quenching of <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> by plastoquinols and their oxidation products is limited in vivo. In the present study, the role of plastoquinol-9 (PQH<sub>2</sub> -9) in chemical quenching of <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> was studied in Arabidopsis thaliana lines overexpressing the SOLANESYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1 gene (SPS1oex) involved in PQH<sub>2</sub> -9 and plastochromanol-8 biosynthesis. In this work, direct evidence for chemical quenching of <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> by plastoquinols and their oxidation products is presented, which is obtained by microscopic techniques in vivo. Chemical quenching of <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> was associated with consumption of PQH<sub>2</sub> -9 and formation of its various oxidized forms. Oxidation of PQH<sub>2</sub> -9 by <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> leads to plastoquinone-9 (PQ-9), which is subsequently oxidized to hydroxyplastoquinone-9 [PQ(OH)-9]. We provide here evidence that oxidation of PQ(OH)-9 by <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> results in the formation of trihydroxyplastoquinone-9 [PQ(OH)<sub>3</sub> -9]. It is concluded here that PQH<sub>2</sub> -9 serves as an efficient <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> chemical quencher in Arabidopsis, and PQ(OH)<sub>3</sub> -9 can be considered as a natural product of <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> reaction with PQ(OH)-9. The understanding of the mechanisms underlying <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> chemical quenching provides information on the role of plastoquinols and their oxidation products in the response of plants to photooxidative stress.
