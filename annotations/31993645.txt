The main functions of plant roots are water and nutrient uptake, soil anchorage, and interaction with soil-living biota. Root hairs, single cell tubular extensions of root epidermal cells, facilitate or enhance these functions by drastically enlarging the absorptive surface. Root hair development is constantly adapted to changes in the root's surroundings, allowing for optimization of root functionality in heterogeneous soil environments. The underlying molecular pathway is the result of a complex interplay between position-dependent signalling and feedback loops. Phytohormone signalling interconnects this root hair signalling cascade with biotic and abiotic changes in the rhizosphere, enabling dynamic hormone-driven changes in root hair growth, density, length, and morphology. This review critically discusses the influence of the major plant hormones on root hair development, and how changes in rhizosphere properties impact on the latter.
