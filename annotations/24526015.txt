In our previous integrated study combining informatics and molecular biology analyses, we revealed that Arabidopsis small open reading frames (sORFs) predicted by computational analysis have biological functions in morphogenesis. Here, we report that sequences homologous to Arabidopsis sORFs are abundant in intergenic regions of the rice genome. These sequences represent a subset of non-protein-coding DNA, and some are transcribed into mRNA. These results indicate that many sORFs associated with morphogenesis are hidden in the genomes of crop species.
