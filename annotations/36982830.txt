Antarctic organisms are consistently suffering from multiple environmental pressures, especially the strong UV radiation caused by the loss of the ozone layer. The mosses and lichens dominate the vegetation of the Antarctic continent, which grow and propagate in these harsh environments. However, the molecular mechanisms and related regulatory networks of these Antarctic plants against UV-B radiation are largely unknown. Here, we used an integrated multi-omics approach to study the regulatory mechanism of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) of an Antarctic moss (<i>Pohlia nutans</i>) in response to UV-B radiation. We identified a total of 5729 lncRNA sequences by transcriptome sequencing, including 1459 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs). Through functional annotation, we found that the target genes of DELs were significantly enriched in plant-pathogen interaction and the flavonoid synthesis pathway. In addition, a total of 451 metabolites were detected by metabonomic analysis, and 97 differentially change metabolites (DCMs) were found. Flavonoids account for 20% of the total significantly up-regulated metabolites. In addition, the comprehensive transcriptome and metabolome analyses revealed the co-expression pattern of DELs and DCMs of flavonoids. Our results provide insights into the regulatory network of lncRNA under UV-B radiation and the adaptation of Antarctic moss to the polar environments.
