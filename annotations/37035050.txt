Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines vary greatly in flowering time, but the genetic basis of this variation is unknown. In this study, three maize flowering-related traits (DTT, days to tasselling; DTP, days to pollen shed; DTS, days to silking) were evaluated with an association panel consisting of 226 maize inbred lines and an F<sub>2:3</sub> population with 120 offspring from a cross between the T32 and Qi319 lines in different environments. A total of 82 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 117 candidate genes were identified by genome-wide association analysis. Twenty-one quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 65 candidate genes were found for maize flowering time by linkage analysis with the constructed high-density genetic map. Transcriptome analysis was performed for Qi319, which is an early-maturing inbred line, and T32, which is a late-maturing inbred line, in two different environments. Compared with T32, Qi319 showed upregulation of 3815 genes and downregulation of 3906 genes. By integrating a genome-wide association study (GWAS), linkage analysis and transcriptome analysis, 25 important candidate genes for maize flowering time were identified. Together, our results provide an important resource and a foundation for an enhanced understanding of flowering time in maize.
