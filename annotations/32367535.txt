Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death process, was found to occur in Magnaporthe oryzae, and plays a key role in infection-related development therein. Ferroptosis in the rice-blast fungus was confirmed based on five basic criteria. We confirmed the dependence of ferroptosis on ferric ions, and optimized ratio-fluorescence imaging of C11-BODIPY<sup>581/591</sup> as a precise sensor for lipid peroxides that mediate ferroptosis in M. oryzae. We uncovered an important regulatory function for reduced glutathione and NADPH oxidases in modulating the superoxide moieties required for ferroptotic cell death. We found ferroptosis to be necessary for the developmental cell death of conidia during appressorium maturation in rice blast. Such ferroptotic cell death initiated first in the terminal cell and progressed sequentially to the entire conidium. Iron chelation or chemical inhibition of ferroptosis caused conidial cells to remain viable, and led to strong defects in host invasion by M. oryzae. Ferroptosis induction exclusively in the host severely constrained the invasive growth of M. oryzae. We found inter-reliant and independent roles for ferroptosis and autophagy in controlling such precise cell death in M. oryzae during pathogenic differentiation. Our study provides significant molecular insights into the role of developmental cell death and iron homeostasis in fungal pathogenesis.
