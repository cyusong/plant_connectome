Brassinosteroids (BRs) participate in the regulation of plant growth and development through BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1)/BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1) family transcription factors. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibers are highly elongated single cells, and BRs play a vital role in the regulation of fiber elongation. However, the mode of action on how BR is involved in the regulation of cotton fiber elongation remains unexplored. Here, we generated GhBES1.4 over expression lines and found that overexpression of GhBES1.4 promoted fiber elongation, whereas silencing of GhBES1.4 reduced fiber length. DNA affinity purification and sequencing (DAP-seq) identified 1,531 target genes of GhBES1.4, and five recognition motifs of GhBES1.4 were identified by enrichment analysis. Combined analysis of DAP-seq and RNA-seq data of GhBES1.4-OE/RNAi provided mechanistic insights into GhBES1.4-mediated regulation of cotton fiber development. Further, with the integrated approach of GWAS, RNA-seq, and DAP-seq, we identified seven genes related to fiber elongation that were directly regulated by GhBES1.4. Of them, we showed Cytochrome P450 84A1 (GhCYP84A1) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase 1 (GhHMG1) promote cotton fiber elongation. Overall, the present study established the role of GhBES1.4-mediated gene regulation and laid the foundation for further understanding the mechanism of BR participation in regulating fiber development.
