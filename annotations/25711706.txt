The nuclear envelope (NE) is a fundamental structure of the nucleus and plays an important role in nuclear morphology through the strict regulation of NE protein function. Beyond its physical barrier function between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, recent studies of the plant NE have provided novel insights into basic aspects of nuclear morphology as well as cellular organization. In this review, we focus on plant NE proteins that have emerged from recent studies in nuclear morphology, and we discuss their physiological functions in cellular activities. A better understanding of the NE protein functions should provide key insights into the physiological significance of proper nuclear structure in plants.
