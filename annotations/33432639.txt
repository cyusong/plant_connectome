Salinity is a major environmental constraint that substantially limits global agricultural productivity. HD-Zip I transcription factors are involved in plant responses to salt stress, but little is known about the HD-Zip I genes in apple (Malus domestica). Here, we characterized the function of an apple HD-Zip I gene (MdHB7-like) and report that its expression is induced by salt stress. To further explore its role in salt stress, we created MdHB7-like overexpressing and RNAi transgenic apple plants. The overexpression of MdHB7-like improved the photosynthetic performance and reduced ROS and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation under salt stress. Plants that overexpressed MdHB7-like also showed increased accumulation of proline and soluble sugars, which may have played an important role in their salt stress tolerance. RNAi suppression of MdHB7-like had the opposite effects. Together, our results demonstrate that MdHB7-like is an important regulator of salt tolerance in apple. Our results provide new insights for future research on the mechanisms by which MdHB7-like promotes salt tolerance and provide a potential target for molecular breeding in apple.
