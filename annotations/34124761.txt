['34124761', 'Increasing evidence suggests that posttranscriptional regulation is a key player  in the transition between mature pollen and the progamic phase (from pollination  to fertilization). Nonetheless, the actors in this messenger RNA (mRNA)-based  gene expression reprogramming are poorly understood. We demonstrate that the  evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein LARP6C is necessary for the  transition from dry pollen to pollen tubes and the guided growth of pollen tubes  towards the ovule in Arabidopsis thaliana. In dry pollen, LARP6C binds to  transcripts encoding proteins that function in lipid synthesis and homeostasis,  vesicular trafficking, and polarized cell growth. LARP6C also forms cytoplasmic  granules that contain the poly(A) binding protein and possibly represent storage  sites for translationally silent mRNAs. In pollen tubes, the loss of LARP6C  negatively affects the quantities and distribution of storage lipids, as well as  vesicular trafficking. In Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells and in planta,  analysis of reporter mRNAs designed from the LARP6C target MGD2 provided evidence  that LARP6C can shift from a repressor to an activator of translation when the  pollen grain enters the progamic phase. We propose that LARP6C orchestrates the  timely posttranscriptional regulation of a subset of mRNAs in pollen during the  transition from the quiescent to active state and along the progamic phase to  promote male fertilization in plants.', '2021 Aug 31', 'Plant Cell', '10.1093/plcell/koab131', 'ORCID:']
