Invasive plant species often competitively displace native plant species but some populations of native plant species can evolve adaptation to competition from invasive plants and persist in invaded habitats. However, studies are lacking that examine how variation in abiotic conditions in invaded landscapes may affect fitness of native plants that have adapted to compete with invasive plants. I tested whether invasion by Parthenium hysterophorus in Nairobi National Park - Kenya may have selected for native plant individuals with greater competitive ability than conspecific naïve natives in nutrient-rich and mesic soil conditions. I compared vegetative growth and seed yields of invader-experienced and conspecific naïve individuals of seven native species. Invader-experienced natives grew shorter than naïve natives regardless of growth conditions. Nevertheless, the two groups of native plants also exhibited treatment-specific differences in competitive ability against P. hysterophorus. Invader-experienced natives displayed plasticity in seed yield under drought treatment, while naïve natives did not. Moreover, drought treatment enhanced competitive effects of invader-experienced natives on P. hysterophorus, while nutrient enrichment relaxed competitive effects of invader-experienced natives on the invader. The results suggest that P. hysterophorus may have selected for shorter native plant genotypes that also exhibit plasticity in competitive ability under drought conditions.
