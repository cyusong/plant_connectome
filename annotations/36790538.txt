Plants have developed strategies to deal with the great variety of challenges they are exposed to. Among them, common targets are the regulation of transcription and translation to finely modulate protein levels during both biotic and abiotic stresses. Increasing evidence suggests that ribosomes are highly adaptable modular supramolecular structures which remodel to adapt to stresses. Each Arabidopsis thaliana ribosome consists of approximately 81 distinct ribosomal proteins (RPs), each of which is encoded by two to seven genes. To investigate the identity of ribosomal proteins of the small subunit (RPS) and of the large subunit (RPL) as well as ribosomes-associated proteins, we analysed by LC/MS/MS immunopurified ribosomes from A. thaliana leaves treated with isonicotinic acid (INA), an inducer of plant innate immunity. We quantified a total of 2084 proteins. 165 ribosome-associated proteins showed increased abundance while 52 were less abundant. Of the 52 identified RPS (from a possibility of 104 encoding genes), 15 were deregulated. Similarly, from the 148 possible RPL, 80 were detected and 9 were deregulated. Our results revealed potential candidates involved in innate immunity that could be interesting targets for functional genomic studies.
