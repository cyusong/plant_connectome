Microsporogenesis, associated with the functional expression of many genes, is a highly programmed and regulated process in flowering plants. To elucidate the roles of genes during anther development, two anther-specific cDNAs (designated GhACS1 and GhACS2) encoding acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs) were isolated from a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) flower cDNA library. Subsequently, the corresponding GhACS1 gene was isolated from a cotton genomic DNA library. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and northern blot analyses revealed that GhACS1 transcripts were predominantly accumulated in the developing anthers of cotton. The specificity of GhACS1 expression in primary sporogenous cells (PSCs), pollen mother cells (PMCs), microspores, and tapetal cells was demonstrated by in situ hybridization as well as histochemical assay of GUS expression controlled under the GhACS1 promoter. High levels of GhACS1 activity are crucial for fatty acid metabolism in PSCs, PMCs, microspores and particularly tapetal cells. Reduction of ACS enzymatic activity by suppressing GhACS1 expression severely affected the tapetal cells and consequently blocked normal microsporogenesis in early anther development. Aberrant and defective microspores were generated in the transgenic anthers. As a result, the transgenic plants failed to produce functional pollen grains and were male-sterile, suggesting that the GhACS1 gene is required for normal microsporogenesis in early anther development of cotton.
