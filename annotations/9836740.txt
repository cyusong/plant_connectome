['9836740', 'The division of plastids is critical for viability in photosynthetic eukaryotes,  but the mechanisms associated with this process are still poorly understood. We  previously identified a nuclear gene from Arabidopsis encoding a  chloroplast-localized homolog of the bacterial cell division protein FtsZ, an  essential cytoskeletal component of the prokaryotic cell division apparatus.  Here, we report the identification of a second nuclear-encoded FtsZ-type protein  from Arabidopsis that does not contain a chloroplast targeting sequence or other  obvious sorting signals and is not imported into isolated chloroplasts, which  strongly suggests that it is localized in the cytosol. We further demonstrate  using antisense technology that inhibiting expression of either Arabidopsis FtsZ  gene (AtFtsZ1-1 or AtFtsZ2-1) in transgenic plants reduces the number of  chloroplasts in mature leaf cells from 100 to one, indicating that both genes are  essential for division of higher plant chloroplasts but that each plays a  distinct role in the process. Analysis of currently available plant FtsZ  sequences further suggests that two functionally divergent FtsZ gene families  encoding differentially localized products participate in chloroplast division.  Our results provide evidence that both chloroplastic and cytosolic forms of FtsZ  are involved in chloroplast division in higher plants and imply that important  differences exist between chloroplasts and prokaryotes with regard to the roles  played by FtsZ proteins in the division process.', '1998 Dec', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.12.1991', 'Lee']
