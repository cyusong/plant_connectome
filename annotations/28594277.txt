A GC-MS based analytical approach was undertaken to understand the metabolomic responses of seedlings of 2 salt sensitive (Sujala and MTU 7029) and 2 tolerant varieties (Bhutnath, and Nonabokra) of indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) to NaCl induced stress. The 4 varieties responded differently to NaCl treatment with respect to the conserved primary metabolites (sugars, polyols, amino acids, organic acids and certain purine derivatives) of the leaf of rice seedlings. However, there were significant differences in salt induced production of chorismic acid derivatives. Serotonin level was increased in both the salt tolerant varieties in response to NaCl induced stress. In both the salt tolerant varieties, increased production of the signaling molecule gentisic acid in response to NaCl treatment was noticed. Salt tolerant varieties also produced increased level of ferulic acid and vanillic acid. In the salt sensitive varieties, cinnamic acid derivatives, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (in Sujala) and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (in MTU 7029), were elevated in the leaves. So increased production of the 2 signaling molecules serotonin and gentisic acid may be considered as 2 important biomarker compounds produced in tolerant varieties contributing toward NaCl tolerance.
