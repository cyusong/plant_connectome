['19150360', 'Transcript elongation factor TFIIS promotes efficient transcription by RNA  polymerase II, since it assists in bypassing blocks during mRNA synthesis. While  yeast cells lacking TFIIS are viable, inactivation of mouse TFIIS causes  embryonic lethality. Here, we have identified a protein encoded in the  Arabidopsis genome that displays a marked sequence similarity to TFIIS of other  organisms, primarily within domains II and III in the C-terminal part of the  protein. TFIIS is widely expressed in Arabidopsis, and a green fluorescent  protein-TFIIS fusion protein localises specifically to the cell nucleus. When  expressed in yeast cells lacking the endogenous TFIIS, Arabidopsis TFIIS  partially complements the sensitivity of mutant cells to the nucleotide analog  6-azauridine, which is a typical characteristic of transcript elongation factors.  We have characterised Arabidopsis lines harbouring T-DNA insertions in the coding  sequence of TFIIS. Plants homozygous for T-DNA insertions are viable, and  genomewide transcript profiling revealed that compared to control plants, a  relatively small number of genes are differentially expressed in mutant plants.  TFIIS(-/-) plants display essentially normal development, but they flower  slightly earlier than control plants and show clearly reduced seed dormancy.  Plants with RNAi-mediated knockdown of TFIIS expression also are affected in seed  dormancy. Therefore, TFIIS plays a critical role in Arabidopsis seed development.', '2009 Feb 27', 'J Mol Biol', '10.1016/j.jmb.2008.12.066', 'Grasser']
