Although not essential for most plants, sodium (Na(+)) can be beneficial to plants in many conditions, particularly when potassium (K(+)) is deficient. As such it can be regarded a 'non-essential' or 'functional' nutrient. By contrast, the many salinized areas around the globe force plants to deal with toxicity from high levels of Na(+) in the environment and within tissues. Progress has been made in identifying the relevant membrane transporters involved in the uptake and distribution of Na(+). The latter is important in the context of mitigating salinity stress but also for the optimization of Na(+) as an abundantly available functional nutrient. In both cases plants are likely to require mechanism(s) to monitor Na(+) concentration, possibly in multiple compartments, to regulate gene expression and transport activities. Extremely little is known about whether such mechanisms are present and if so, how they operate, either at the cellular or the tissue level. This paper gives an overview of the regulatory and potential sensing mechanisms that pertain to Na(+), in both the context of salt stress and Na(+) as a nutrient.
