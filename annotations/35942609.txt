Chromium (Cr) pollution threatens plant development and growth. Application of melatonin (Mel) is emerging as an effective ally to resist stress, but how Mel ameliorates seed germination upon exposure to heavy metals is poorly understood. Here, we found (i) that seed priming with Mel considerably alleviated Cr stress during rice (Oryza sativa) seed germination and (ii) that germination performance was significantly improved in suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1 (OsSGT1) overexpression lines, while mutations of OsSGT1 and/or abscisic acid-insensitive 5 (OsABI5) noticeably abrogated such Mel-induced tolerance to Cr. Complementation assays suggested that the restored expression of OsSGT1 could not rescue the weak germination of sgt1-1abi5 under Cr stress, even upon Mel priming, but the expression of OsABI5 driven by the promoter of OsSGT1 significantly restored the Mel-ameliorated germination and the expression of ascorbate peroxidase 1 (OsAPX1) in sgt1-1abi5. Further analysis indicated that OsABI5 directly regulated the transcriptional expression of OsAPX1, whose encoding products promoted H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> scavenging to maintain redox homeostasis, which is essential for germination. Collectively, this work demonstrates that OsSGT1 regulates OsABI5 to target OsAPX1, mediating the stimulatory effects of Mel on germination of Cr-stressed seeds, which provides a guide for the application of Mel in rice production.
