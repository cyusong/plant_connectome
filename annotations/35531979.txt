<i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i> (<i>SB</i>), a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, is widely used because of its important pharmacological activities. However, the endophytic fungi that promote flavonoid accumulation in <i>SB</i> remain unclear. Therefore, we analyzed the endophytic fungal community of <i>SB</i> and screened the endophytic fungi that might promote flavonoid synthesis in <i>SB</i>. ITS1/ITS4Blast was used to identify the endophytic fungi in <i>SB</i>. In total, 687 strains were identified in 57 genera. The dominant genus in the leaves and stems was <i>Alternaria</i> and that in the roots was <i>Fusarium. Alternaria</i> was the dominant genus in <i>SB</i> collected from all sites and in wild and cultivated <i>SB</i>. Alpha diversity indexes indicated more abundant endophytic fungi in samples from Chengde, the genuine producing area of <i>SB</i>, than in those from other sites. Beta diversity index analysis indicated that <i>SB</i> plants with closer geographical relationships showed more similar endophytic fungal community profiles. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that baicalin, wogonoside, wogonin, and oroxylin A contents were significantly correlated with the relative abundance of <i>Alternaria</i>. Overall, the results indicate the importance of geographical factors in influencing the endophytic fungal community of <i>SB</i> and suggest that the presence of <i>Alternaria</i> spp. might contribute to flavonoid synthesis in <i>SB.</i>
