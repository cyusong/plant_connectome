['29107034', 'How plant metabolic flux alters gene expression to optimize plant growth and  response to stress remains largely unclear. Here, we report that Arabidopsis  thaliana NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase AtSRT1 negatively regulates plant  tolerance to stress and glycolysis but stimulates mitochondrial respiration. We  found that AtSRT1 interacts with Arabidopsis cMyc-Binding Protein 1 (AtMBP-1), a  transcriptional repressor produced by alternative translation of the cytosolic  glycolytic enolase gene LOS2/ENO2. We demonstrated that AtSRT1 could associate  with the chromatin of AtMBP-1 targets LOS2/ENO2 and STZ/ZAT10, both of which  encode key stress regulators, and reduce the H3K9ac levels at these genes to  repress their transcription. Overexpression of both AtSRT1 and AtMBP-1 had  synergistic effects on the expression of glycolytic genes, glycolytic enzymatic  activities, and mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, we found that AtMBP-1 is  lysine-acetylated and vulnerable to proteasomal protein degradation, while AtSRT1  could remove its lysine acetylation and significantly enhance its stability  in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that AtSRT1 regulates primary  metabolism and stress response by both epigenetic regulation and modulation of  AtMBP-1 transcriptional activity in Arabidopsis.', '2017 Dec 4', 'Mol Plant', '10.1016/j.molp.2017.10.010', 'Zhou']
