As sessile organisms, plants are constantly challenged by a dynamic growing environment. This includes fluctuations in temperature, water availability, light levels, and changes in atmospheric constituents such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub> ) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub> ). In concert with changes in abiotic conditions, plants experience changes in biotic stress pressures, including plant pathogens and herbivores. Human-induced increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels have led to alterations in plant growth environments that impact their productivity and nutritional quality. Additionally, it is predicted that climate change will alter the prevalence and virulence of plant pathogens, further challenging plant growth. A knowledge gap exists in the complex interplay between plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress conditions. Closing this gap is crucial for developing climate resilient crops in the future. Here, we briefly review the physiological responses of plants to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> , temperature, tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> , and drought conditions, as well as the interaction of these abiotic stress factors with plant pathogen pressure. Additionally, we describe the crosstalk and trade-offs involved in plant responses to both abiotic and biotic stress, and outline targets for future work to develop a more sustainable future food supply considering future climate change.
