Iron (Fe) chlorosis is a common nutritional deficiency in fruit trees grown in calcareous soils. Grafting on tolerant rootstocks is the most efficient practice to cope with it. In the present work, three Prunus hybrid genotypes, commonly used as peach rootstocks, and one peach cultivar were cultivated with bicarbonate in the growth medium. Parameters describing oxidative stress and the metabolism of reactive nitrogen species were studied. Lower contents of nitric oxide and a decreased nitrosoglutathione reductase activity were found in the most sensitive genotypes, characterized by higher oxidative stress and reduced antioxidant defense. In the peach cultivar, which behaved as a tolerant genotype, a specifically nitrated polypeptide was found.
