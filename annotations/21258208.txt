We investigated how the pea (Pisum sativum cv. Harunoka) root, upon return to an Al-free condition, recovers from injury caused by exposure to Al. Elongation and re-elongation of the root during the recovery process from Al injury occurred only in the apical 5-mm region of the pea root. With the model system of the pea root for recovery from Al injury, images of the root characterized by zonal staining with Evans blue showed the existence of two regions in the root apex consisting of rupture and zonary stained regions. Ruptures enlarged by increase in their depth but without widening of the intervals among zonary stained regions in the roots treated with Al continuously. On the other hand, intervals of the zonary stained regions were widened due to re-elongation of the root and were narrow in the rupture region in the recovery root.

Al: !causes injury to! pea root

Al: !enlarges! ruptures 
root re-elongation: !widens! intervals of zonary stained regions
