Glycemic response, a trait that is tedious to be assayed in cereal staples, has been identified as a factor correlated with alarmingly increasing prevalence of Type II diabetes. Reverse genetics based discovery of allelic variants associated with this nutritional trait gains significance as they can provide scope for genetic improvement of this factor which is otherwise difficult to target through routine screening methods. Through EcoTILLING by sequencing in 512 rice accessions, we report the discovery of six deleterious variants in the genes with potential to increase Resistant Starch (RS) and reduce Hydrolysis Index (HI) of starch. By deconvolution of the variant harbouring EcoTILLING DNA pools, we discovered accessions with a minimum of one to a maximum of three deleterious allelic variants in the candidate genes. Through biochemical assays, we confirmed the potential role of the discovered alleles alone or in combinations in increasing RS the key factor for reduction in glycemic response.
