Cold stress is a key environmental factor that affects plant development and productivity. In this study, RNA-seq in cotton following cold-stress treatment resulted in the identification of 5239 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two cultivars with differing sensitivity to low temperatures, among which GhKCS13 was found to be involved in the response. Transgenic plants overexpressing GhKCS13 showed increased sensitivity to cold stress. KEGG analysis of 418 DEGs in both GhKCS13-overexpressing and RNAi lines after treatment at 4 °C indicated that lipid biosynthesis and linoleic acid metabolism were related to cold stress. ESI-MS/MS analysis showed that overexpression of GhKCS13 led to modifications in the composition of sphingolipids and glycerolipids in the leaves, which might alter the fluidity of the cell membrane under cold conditions. In particular, differences in levels of jasmonic acid (JA) in GhKCS13 transgenic lines suggested that, together with lysophospholipids, it might mediate the cold-stress response. Our results suggest that overexpression of GhKCS13 probably causes remodeling of lipids in the endoplasmic reticulum and biosynthesis of lipid-derived JA in chloroplasts, which might account for the increased sensitivity to cold stress in the transgenic plants. Complex interactions between lipid components, lipid signaling molecules, and JA appear to determine the response to cold stress in cotton.
