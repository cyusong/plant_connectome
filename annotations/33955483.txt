Communication between cellular compartments is vital for development and environmental adaptation. Signals emanating from organelles, so-called retrograde signals, coordinate nuclear gene expression with the developmental stage and/or the functional status of the organelle. Plastids (best known in their green photosynthesizing differentiated form, the chloroplasts) are the primary energy-producing compartment of plant cells, and the site for the biosynthesis of many metabolites, including fatty acids, amino acids, nucleotides, isoprenoids, tetrapyrroles, vitamins, and phytohormone precursors. Signals derived from plastids regulate the accumulation of a large set of nucleus-encoded proteins, many of which localize to plastids. A set of mutants defective in retrograde signaling (genomes uncoupled, or gun) was isolated over 25 years ago. While most GUN genes act in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, resolving the molecular function of GUN1, the proposed integrator of multiple retrograde signals, has turned out to be particularly challenging. Based on its amino acid sequence, GUN1 was initially predicted to be a plastid-localized nucleic acid-binding protein. Only recently, mechanistic information on the function of GUN1 has been obtained, pointing to a role in plastid protein homeostasis. This review article summarizes our current understanding of GUN-related retrograde signaling and provides a critical appraisal of the various proposed roles for GUNs and their respective pathways.
