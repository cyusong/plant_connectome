['18064404', 'Although sucrose availability is crucial for commitment to plant cell division  during G1 phase by controlling the expression of D-type cyclins, it has remained  unclear how these factors mediate entry into the cell cycle. Here we show that  Arabidopsis RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED PROTEIN 1 (AtRBR1) is involved in G1-phase  cell cycle arrest caused by sucrose starvation. We generated estrogen-inducible  AtRBR1 RNA interference (RNAi) Arabidopsis suspension MM2d cells, and found that  downregulation of AtRBR1 leads to a higher frequency of arrest in G2 phase,  instead of G1-phase arrest in the uninduced control, after sucrose starvation.  Synchronization experiments confirmed that downregulation of AtRBR1 leads to a  prolonged G2 phase and delayed activation of G2/M marker genes. Downregulation of  AtRBR1 also stimulated the activation of E2F-regulated genes when these genes  were repressed in the uninduced cells under the limited sucrose conditions. We  conclude that AtRBR1 is a key effector for the ability of sucrose to modulate  progression from G1 phase.', '2008 Feb', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-007-9268-2', 'Sekine']
