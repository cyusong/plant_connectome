['15273293', 'In higher plants, photorespiratory Gly oxidation in leaf mitochondria yields  ammonium in large amounts. Mitochondrial ammonium must somehow be recovered as  glutamate in chloroplasts. As the first step in that recovery, we report  glutamine synthetase (GS) activity in highly purified Arabidopsis thaliana  mitochondria isolated from light-adapted leaf tissue. Leaf mitochondrial GS  activity is further induced in response to either physiological CO(2) limitation  or transient darkness. Historically, whether mitochondria are fully competent for  oxidative phosphorylation in actively photorespiring leaves has remained  uncertain. Here, we report that light-adapted, intact, leaf mitochondria supplied  with Gly as sole energy source are fully competent for oxidative phosphorylation.  Purified intact mitochondria efficiently use Gly oxidation (as sole energy,  NH(3), and CO(2) source) to drive conversion of l-Orn to l-citrulline, an  ATP-dependent process. An A. thaliana genome-wide search for nuclear gene(s)  encoding mitochondrial GS activity yielded a single candidate, GLN2. Stably  transgenic A. thaliana ecotype Columbia plants expressing a p35S::GLN2::green  fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeric reporter were constructed. When observed by  laser scanning confocal microscopy, leaf mesophyll and epidermal tissue of  transgenic plants showed punctate GFP fluorescence that colocalized with  mitochondria. In immunoblot experiments, a 41-kD chimeric GLN2::GFP protein was  present in both leaf mitochondria and chloroplasts of these stably transgenic  plants. Therefore, the GLN2 gene product, heretofore labeled plastidic GS-2,  functions in both leaf mitochondria and chloroplasts to faciliate ammonium  recovery during photorespiration.', '2004 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.104.022046', 'Ludwig']
