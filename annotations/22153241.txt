['22153241', 'ABSCISIC ACID DEFICIENT2 (ABA2) encodes a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase1  (SDR1) that catalyzes the multi-step conversion of xanthoxin to abscisic aldehyde  during abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study,  AtSDR2 and AtSDR3, the two closest homologs to AtABA2, were investigated for  their potential role in ABA biosynthesis. AtSDR2 showed undetectable  transcription in plants grown under normal conditions or under stress. AtSDR3 and  AtABA2 have different spatial and temporal expression patterns. Complementation  testing demonstrated that the pABA2::SDR3 transgene failed to complement the aba2  mutant phenotype, and that transgenic plants showed the same levels of ABA as the  aba2 mutants. These data suggest that AtSDR3 confers no functional redundancy to  AtABA2 in ABA biosynthesis. Interestingly, microarray data derived from  Genevestigator suggested that AtSDR3 might have a function that is related to  plant defense. Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 infection and  systemic acquired resistance (SAR) activator application further demonstrated  that AtSDR3 plays an important role in plant defense responses at least partially  through the regulation of AtPR-1 gene expression.', '2012 Feb', 'Plant Physiol Biochem', '10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.10.013', 'Cheng']
