Correct timing of developmental phase transitions is critical for the survival and fitness of plants. Developmental phase transitions in plants are partially promoted by controlling relevant genes into active or repressive status. Polycomb Repressive Complex1 (PRC1) and PRC2, originally identified in Drosophila, are essential in initiating and/or maintaining genes in repressive status to mediate developmental phase transitions. Our review summarizes mechanisms in which the embryo-to-seedling transition, the juvenile-to-adult transition, and vegetative-to-reproductive transition in plants are mediated by PRC1 and PRC2, and suggests that PRC1 could act either before or after PRC2, or that they could function independently of each other. Details of the exact components of PRC1 and PRC2 in each developmental phase transitions and how they are recruited or removed will need to be addressed in the future.
