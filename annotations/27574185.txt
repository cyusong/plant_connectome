['27574185', 'DUF177 proteins are nearly universally conserved in bacteria and plants except  the Chlorophyceae algae. Thus far, duf177 mutants in bacteria have not  established a function. In contrast, duf177a mutants have embryo lethal  phenotypes in maize and Arabidopsis. In maize inbred W22, duf177a mutant embryos  arrest at an early transition stage, whereas the block is suppressed in the B73  inbred background, conditioning an albino seedling phenotype.  Background-dependent embryo lethal phenotypes are characteristic of maize plastid  gene expression mutants. Consistent with the plastid gene expression hypothesis,  quantitative real-time PCR revealed a significant reduction of 23S rRNA in an  Escherichia coli duf177 knockout. Plastid 23S rRNA contents of duf177a mutant  tissues were also markedly reduced compared with the wild-type, whereas plastid  16S, 5S, and 4.5S rRNA contents were less affected, indicating that DUF177 is  specifically required for accumulation of prokaryote-type 23S rRNA. An  AtDUF177A-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene controlled by the native  AtDUF177A promoter fully complemented the Arabidopsis atduf177a mutant. Transient  expression of AtDUF177A-GFP in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves showed that the  protein was localized in chloroplasts. The essential role of DUF177A in  chloroplast-ribosome formation is reminiscent of IOJAP, another highly conserved  ribosome-associated protein, suggesting that key mechanisms controlling ribosome  formation in plastids evolved from non-essential pathways for regulation of the  prokaryotic ribosome.', '2016 Oct', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erw311', 'ORCID:']
