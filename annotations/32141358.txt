Present findings hypothesize that salt-tolerant and -sensitive oilseed plants are expected to exhibit deviant patterns of growth through lipolytic events in seedling cotyledons. It reports the growth response and different lipolytic mechanisms operating during oil body (OB) mobilization in the seedling cotyledons of salt-tolerant (DRSH 1) and salt-sensitive (PSH 1962) varieties of sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i> L.). Salt tolerance or sensitivity to 120 mM NaCl correlates with high proteolytic degradation of OB membrane proteins, particularly oleosins, whereas salt-sensitive seedling cotyledons exhibit negligible proteolytic activity, thereby retaining OB membrane integrity for a longer time. High lipoxygenase (LOX) activity and its further upregulation by salt stress are the unique features of salt-sensitive sunflower seedlings. Salt-tolerant seedling cotyledons exhibit noteworthy modulation of phospholipase-D (PLD) activity by salt stress. Salt-sensitive seedling cotyledons exhibit higher lipase activity than salt-sensitive ones and enzyme activity is downregulated by salt stress. Salt-sensitive variety exhibits higher lipid accumulation and faster lipid mobilization with seedling development than salt-tolerant variety. Accumulation of oleic and linoleic acid in the seedling cotyledons of salt-tolerant and sensitive varieties exhibits differential sensitivity to salt stress. Novel detection of hexanoic acid (6:0) is a noteworthy feature as a response to salt stress in salt-sensitive variety. These findings, thus, provide new information on long-distance salt stress sensing mechanisms at seedling stage of plant development.
