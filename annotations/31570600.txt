Droplet manipulation is playing an important role in various fields, including scientific research, industrial production, and daily life. Here, inspired by the microstructures and functions of Namib desert beetles, Nepenthes pitcher plants, and emergent aquatic plants, we present a multibioinspired slippery surface for droplet manipulation by employing combined strategies of bottom-up colloidal self-assembly, top-down photolithography, and microstructured mold replication. The resultant multilayered hierarchical wettability surface consists of hollow hydrogel bump arrays and a lubricant-infused inverse opal film as the substrate. Based on capillary force, together with slippery properties of the substrate and wettability of the bump arrays, water droplets from all directions can be attracted to the bumps and be collected through hollow channels to a reservoir. Independent of extra energy input, droplet condensation, or coalescence, these surfaces have shown ideal droplet pumping and water collection efficiency. In particular, these slippery surfaces also exhibit remarkable features including versatility, generalization, and recyclability in practical use such as small droplet collection, which make them promising candidates for a wide range of applications.
