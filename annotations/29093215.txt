Phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) regulates transcription of protein-coding mRNAs and noncoding RNAs. CTD function in transcription of protein-coding RNAs has been studied extensively, but its role in plant noncoding RNA transcription remains obscure. Here, using <i>Arabidopsis thaliana CTD PHOSPHATASE-LIKE4</i> knockdown lines (<i>CPL4<sub>RNAi</sub></i> ), we showed that CPL4 functions in genome-wide, conditional production of 3'-extensions of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and biogenesis of novel transcripts from protein-coding genes downstream of the snRNAs (snRNA-downstream protein-coding genes [snR-DPGs]). Production of snR-DPGs required the Pol II snRNA promoter (PIIsnR), and <i>CPL4<sub>RNAi</sub></i> plants showed increased read-through of the snRNA 3'-end processing signal, leading to continuation of transcription downstream of the snRNA gene. We also discovered an unstable, intermediate-length RNA from the <i>SMALL SCP1-LIKE PHOSPHATASE14</i> locus (<i>imRNA<sub>SSP14</sub></i> ), whose expression originated from the 5' region of a protein-coding gene. Expression of the <i>imRNA<sub>SSP14</sub></i> was driven by a PIIsnR and was conditionally 3'-extended to produce an mRNA. In the wild type, salt stress induced the snRNA-to-snR-DPG switch, which was associated with alterations of Pol II-CTD phosphorylation at the target loci. The snR-DPG transcripts occur widely in plants, suggesting that the transcriptional snRNA-to-snR-DPG switch may be a ubiquitous mechanism to regulate plant gene expression in response to environmental stresses.
