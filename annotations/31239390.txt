Premature senescence in annual crops reduces yield, while delayed senescence, termed stay-green, imposes positive and negative impacts on yield and nutrition quality. Despite its importance, scant information is available on the genetic architecture of senescence in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and other cereals. We combined a systematic characterization of natural diversity for senescence in maize and coexpression networks derived from transcriptome analysis of normally senescing and stay-green lines. Sixty-four candidate genes were identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS), and 14 of these genes are supported by additional evidence for involvement in senescence-related processes including proteolysis, sugar transport and signaling, and sink activity. Eight of the GWAS candidates, independently supported by a coexpression network underlying stay-green, include a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, a NAC transcription factor, and two xylan biosynthetic enzymes. Source-sink communication and the activity of cell walls as a secondary sink emerge as key determinants of stay-green. Mutant analysis supports the role of a candidate encoding Cys protease in stay-green in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and analysis of natural alleles suggests a similar role in maize. This study provides a foundation for enhanced understanding and manipulation of senescence for increasing carbon yield, nutritional quality, and stress tolerance of maize and other cereals.
