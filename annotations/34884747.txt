Programmed cell death (PCD) plays crucial roles in plant development and defence response. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during normal plant growth, and high ROS concentrations can change the antioxidant status of cells, leading to spontaneous cell death. In addition, ROS function as signalling molecules to improve plant stress tolerance, and they induce PCD under different conditions. This review describes the mechanisms underlying plant PCD, the key functions of mitochondria and chloroplasts in PCD, and the relationship between mitochondria and chloroplasts during PCD. Additionally, the review discusses the factors that regulate PCD. Most importantly, in this review, we summarise the sites of production of ROS and discuss the roles of ROS that not only trigger multiple signalling pathways leading to PCD but also participate in the execution of PCD, highlighting the importance of ROS in PCD.
