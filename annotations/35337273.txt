Sophora davidii is an important plant resource in the karst region of Southwest China, but S. davidii plant-height mutants are rarely reported. Therefore, we performed phenotypic, anatomic structural, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to study the mechanisms responsible for S. davidii plant-height mutants. Phenotypic and anatomical observations showed that compared to the wild type, the dwarf mutant displayed a significant decrease in plant height, while the tall mutant displayed a significant increase in plant height. The dwarf mutant cells were smaller and more densely arranged, while those of the wild type and the tall mutant were larger and loosely arranged. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in cell wall biosynthesis, expansion, phytohormone biosynthesis, signal transduction pathways, flavonoid biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were significantly enriched in the S. davidii plant-height mutants. Metabolomic analysis revealed 57 significantly differential metabolites screened from both the dwarf and tall mutants. A total of 8 significantly different flavonoid compounds were annotated to LIPID MAPS, and three metabolites (chlorogenic acid, kaempferol and scopoletin) were involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis. These results shed light on the molecular mechanisms of plant height in S. davidii mutants and provide insight for further molecular breeding programs.
