['17905859', 'To isolate novel auxin-responsive mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana),  we screened mutants for root growth resistance to a putative antiauxin,  p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), which inhibits auxin action by interfering  the upstream auxin-signaling events. Eleven PCIB-resistant mutants were obtained.  Genetic mapping indicates that the mutations are located in at least five  independent loci, including two known auxin-related loci, TRANSPORT INHIBITOR  RESPONSE1 and Arabidopsis CULLIN1. antiauxin-resistant mutants (aars) aar3-1,  aar4, and aar5 were also resistant to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid as shown by  a root growth assay. Positional cloning of aar3-1 revealed that the AAR3 gene  encodes a protein with a domain of unknown function (DUF298), which has not  previously been implicated in auxin signaling. The protein has a putative nuclear  localization signal and shares homology with the DEFECTIVE IN CULLIN  NEDDYLATION-1 protein through the DUF298 domain. The results also indicate that  PCIB can facilitate the identification of factors involved in auxin or  auxin-related signaling.', '2007 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.107.104844', 'Oono']
