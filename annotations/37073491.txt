L-Ascorbic acid (AsA) is more commonly known as vitamin C, and an indispensable compound for human health. As a major antioxidant, AsA can not only maintain redox balance, resist biological and abiotic stress, but also regulate plant growth, induce flowering and delay senescence through complex signal transduction networks. However, AsA content varied greatly in horticultural crops, especially in fruit crops. The AsA content of the highest specie is about 10,000 times higher than that of the lowest specie. There have been significant advancements in the understanding of AsA accumulation in the recent twenty years. The most noteworthy accomplishment was the identification of the critical rate-limiting genes for the two major AsA synthesis pathway (L-galactose pathway and D-galacturonic acid) in fruit crops. The rate-limiting genes of the former were GMP, GME, GGP and GPP, while the rate-limiting genes of the latter was GalUR. Moreover, APX, MDHAR and DHAR were also regarded as key genes in degradation and regeneration pathways. Interestingly, some of these key genes were sensitive to environmental factors, such as GGP induced by light. The efficiency of enhancing AsA content was high by editing uORF of the key genes and constructing multi-gene expression vectors. In summary, the AsA metabolism has been well understood in fruit crops, but the transport mechanism of AsA, and the synergistic improvement of AsA and other traits is less known, which will be the focus of AsA research in fruit crops.
