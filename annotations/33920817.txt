Plants can be considered an open system. Throughout their life cycle, plants need to exchange material, energy and information with the outside world. To improve their survival and complete their life cycle, plants have developed sophisticated mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis during development and in response to environmental changes. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved self-degradative process that occurs ubiquitously in all eukaryotic cells and plays many physiological roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that autophagy can be induced not only by starvation but also as a cellular response to various abiotic stresses, including oxidative, salt, drought, cold and heat stresses. This review focuses mainly on the role of autophagy in plant abiotic stress management.
