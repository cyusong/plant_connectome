Arabidopsis seedlings growing on low concentration of galactose stop regular root growth. Incomplete cell division with cell wall stubs, binuclear and giant cells and lignified root tips are observed. Galactose is a sugar abundant in root cell walls of Arabidopsis. Nevertheless, we found that the germination of Arabidopsis seedlings on galactose containing media causes a strong modification of the root development, as shown by analysing the root with microscopy methods ranging from the bright field over confocal to transmission electron microscopy. At concentrations of about 1 mM, the growth of the primary root stops after a few days though stem cell markers like WOX5 are still expressed. The root tip swells and forms a slightly opaque, partially lignified structure in parts of the cortex and the central cylinder. The formation of the cell plate after mitosis is impaired, often leading to cell wall stubs and binuclear cells. Some cells in the cortex and the central cylinder degenerate, while some rhizodermal and cortical cells increase massively in size. The galactose toxicity phenotype in Arabidopsis depends on the activity of galactokinase and is completely diminished in galactokinase knock-out lines. From the comparison of the galactose toxicity phenotype with those of cytokinesis mutants and plants treated with appropriate inhibitors we speculate that the toxicity syndrome of galactose is caused by interference with intracellular vesicle transport or cell wall biogenesis.
