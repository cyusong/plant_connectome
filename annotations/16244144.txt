['16244144', 'Selenium (Se) is an essential element for many organisms but is toxic at higher  levels. CpNifS is a chloroplastic NifS-like protein in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) that can catalyze the conversion of cysteine into alanine and elemental  sulfur (S0) and of selenocysteine into alanine and elemental Se (Se0). We  overexpressed CpNifS to investigate the effects on Se metabolism in plants.  CpNifS overexpression significantly enhanced selenate tolerance (1.9-fold) and Se  accumulation (2.2-fold). CpNifS overexpressors showed significantly reduced Se  incorporation into protein, which may explain their higher Se tolerance. Also,  sulfur accumulation was enhanced by approximately 30% in CpNifS overexpressors,  both on media with and without selenate. Root transcriptome changes in response  to selenate mimicked the effects observed under sulfur starvation. There were  only a few transcriptome differences between CpNifS-overexpressing plants and  wild type, besides the 25- to 40-fold increase in CpNifS levels. Judged from  x-ray analysis of near edge spectrum, both CpNifS overexpressors and wild type  accumulated mostly selenate (Se(VI)). In conclusion, overexpression of this plant  NifS-like protein had a pronounced effect on plant Se metabolism. The observed  enhanced Se accumulation and tolerance of CpNifS overexpressors show promise for  use in phytoremediation.', '2005 Nov', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.105.068684', 'Pilon-Smits']
