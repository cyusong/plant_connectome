Inorganic phosphate (Pi) deficiency is a major limiting factor for plant growth and development. Previous reports have demonstrated that PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 (PHR1) and OsPHR2 play central roles in Pi-starvation signaling in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively. However, the Pi-starvation signaling network in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is still not fully understood. In this work, SlPHL1, a homolog of AtPHR1 and OsPHR2, was identified from tomato. It was found that SlPHL1 contains the MYB and coiled-coil (CC) domains, localizes in the nucleus, and has transcriptional activity, indicating that it is a typical MYB-CC transcription factor (TF). Overexpression of SlPHL1 enhanced Pi-starvation responses both in Arabidopsis Col-0 and in tomato Micro-Tom, including elevated root hair growth, promoted APase activity, favored Pi uptake, and increased transcription of Pi starvation-inducing (PSI) genes. Besides, overexpressing SlPHL1 was able to compensate for the Pi-starvation response weakened by the AtPHR1 mutation. Notably, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that SlPHL1 could bind to the PHR1-binding sequence (P1BS, GNATATNC)-containing DNA fragments. Furthermore, SlPHL1 specifically interacted with the promoters of the tomato PSI genes SlPht1;2 and SlPht1;8 through the P1BS cis-elements. Taken these results together, SlPHL1 is a newly identified MYB-CC TF from tomato, which participates in Pi-starvation signaling by directly upregulating the PSI genes. These findings might contribute to the understanding of the Pi-starvation signaling in tomato.
