The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many key processes in plants, such as seed germination, seedling growth, and abiotic stress tolerance. In recent years, a minimal set of core components of a major ABA signaling pathway has been discovered. These components include a RCAR/PYR/PYL family of ABA receptors, a group of PP2C phosphatases, and three SnRK2 kinases. However, how the interactions between the receptors and their targets are regulated by other proteins remains largely unknown. In a companion paper published in this issue, we showed that ROP11, a member of the plant-specific Rho-like small GTPase family, negatively regulates multiple ABA responses in Arabidopsis. The current work demonstrated that the constitutively active ROP11 (CA-ROP11) can modulate the RCAR1/PYL9-mediated ABA signaling pathway based on reconstitution assays in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. Furthermore, using luciferase complementation imaging, yeast two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation assays in Nicotiana benthamiana and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we demonstrated that CA-ROP11 directly interacts with ABI1, a signaling component downstream of RCAR1/PYL9. Finally, we provided biochemical evidence that CA-ROP11 protects ABI1 phosphatase activity from inhibition by RCAR1/PYL9 and thus negatively regulates ABA signaling in plant cells. A model of how ROP11 acts to negatively regulate ABA signaling is presented.
