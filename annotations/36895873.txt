Soil Cadmium (Cd) pollution has become a serious environmental problem. Silicon (Si) plays key roles in alleviating Cd toxicity in plants. However, the effects of Si on mitigation of Cd toxicity and accumulation of Cd by hyperaccumulators are largely unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of Si on Cd accumulation and the physiological characteristics of Cd hyperaccumulator <i>Sedum alfredii Hance</i> under Cd stress. Results showed that, exogenous Si application promoted the biomass, Cd translocation and concentration of <i>S. alfredii</i>, with an increased rate of 21.74-52.17% for shoot biomass, and 412.39-621.00% for Cd accumulation. Moreover, Si alleviated Cd toxicity by: (i) increasing chlorophyll contents, (ii) improving antioxidant enzymes, (iii) enhancing cell wall components (lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin), (iv) raising the secretion of organic acids (oxalic acid, tartaric acid and L-malic acid). The RT-PCR analysis of genes that involved in Cd detoxification showed that the expression of <i>SaNramp3</i>, <i>SaNramp6</i>, <i>SaHMA2</i> and <i>SaHMA4</i> in roots were significantly decreased by 11.46-28.23%, 6.61-65.19%, 38.47-80.87%, 44.80-69.85% and 33.96-71.70% in the Si treatments, while Si significantly increased the expression of <i>SaCAD</i>. This study expanded understanding on the role of Si in phytoextraction and provided a feasible strategy for assisting phytoextraction Cd by <i>S. alfredii</i>. In summary, Si facilitated the Cd phytoextraction of <i>S. alfredii</i> by promoting plant growth and enhancing the resistance of plants to Cd.
