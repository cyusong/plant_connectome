Drought stress poses a serious threat to global agricultural productivity and food security. Plant resistance to drought is typically accompanied by a growth deficit and yield penalty. Herein, we report a previously uncharacterized, dicotyledon-specific gene, Stress and Growth Interconnector (SGI), that promotes growth during drought in the oil crop rapeseed (Brassica napus) and model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Overexpression of SGI conferred enhanced biomass and yield under water-deficient conditions, whereas corresponding CRISPR SGI mutants exhibited the opposite effects. These attributes were achieved by mediating reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis while maintaining photosynthetic efficiency to increase plant fitness under water-limiting environments. Further spatial-temporal transcriptome profiling revealed dynamic reprogramming of pathways for photosynthesis and stress responses during drought and the subsequent recovery. Mechanistically, SGI represents an intrinsically disordered region-containing protein that interacts with itself, catalase isoforms, dehydrins and other drought-responsive positive factors, restraining ROS generation. These multifaceted interactions stabilize catalases in response to drought and facilitate their ROS-scavenging activities. Taken altogether, these findings provide insights into currently underexplored mechanisms to circumvent trade-offs between plant growth and stress tolerance that will inform strategies to breed climate resilient, higher yielding crops for sustainable agriculture.
