The decreasing precipitation with global climate warming is the main climatic condition in some sandy grassland ecosystems. The understanding of physiological responses of psammophytes in relation to warming and precipitation is a possible way to estimate the response of plant community stability to climate change. We selected <i>Lespedeza davurica</i>, <i>Artemisia scoparia</i>, and <i>Cleistogenes squarrosa</i> in sandy grassland to examine the effect of a combination of climate warming and decreasing precipitation on relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll, proline, and antioxidant enzyme activities. We found that all experimental treatments have influenced RWC, chlorophyll, proline, and antioxidant enzyme activities of three psammophytes. <i>L. davurica</i> has the highest leaf RWC among the three psammophytes. With the intensification of precipitation reduction, the decreasing amplitude of chlorophyll from three psammophytes was <i>L. davurica</i> > <i>C. squarrosa</i> > <i>A. scoparia</i>. At the natural temperature, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the three psammophytes under severe drought treatment was much higher than other treatments, and their increasing degree was as follows: <i>A. scoparia</i> > <i>C. squarrosa</i> > <i>L. davurica</i>. At the same precipitation gradient, the proline of three psammophytes under warming was higher than the natural temperature. The differences in superoxide dismutase (SOD) among the three psammophytes were <i>A. scoparia</i> > <i>L. davurica</i> > <i>C. squarrosa.</i> Moreover, at natural temperature, more than 40% of precipitation reduction was most significant. Regardless of warming or not, the catalase (CAT) activity of <i>A. scoparia</i> under reduced precipitation treatments was higher than natural temperature, while the response of <i>L. davurica</i> was opposite. Correlation analyses evidenced that warming (T) was significant in <i>L. davurica</i> and precipitation (W) was significant in <i>A. scoparia</i> and <i>C. squarrosa</i> according to the Monte-Carlo permutation test (<i>p</i> = 0.002, 0.004, and 0.004). The study is important in predicting how local plants will respond to future climate change and assessing the possible effects of climate change on sandy grassland ecosystems.
