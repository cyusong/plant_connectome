Currently, biology is revolutionized by ever growing applications of the CRISPR/Cas system. As discussed in this Review, new avenues have opened up for plant research and breeding by the use of the sequence-specific DNases Cas9 and Cas12 (formerly named Cpf1) and, more recently, the RNase Cas13 (formerly named C2c2). Although double strand break-induced gene editing based on error-prone nonhomologous end joining has been applied to obtain new traits, such as powdery mildew resistance in wheat or improved pathogen resistance and increased yield in tomato, improved technologies based on CRISPR/Cas for programmed change in plant genomes via homologous recombination have recently been developed. Cas9- and Cas12- mediated DNA binding is used to develop tools for many useful applications, such as transcriptional regulation or fluorescence-based imaging of specific chromosomal loci in plant genomes. Cas13 has recently been applied to degrade mRNAs and combat viral RNA replication. By the possibility to address multiple sequences with different guide RNAs and by the simultaneous use of different Cas proteins in a single cell, we should soon be able to achieve complex changes of plant metabolism in a controlled way.
