['32308664', 'Nutrient availability, in particular the availability of sugar [carbon (C)] and  nitrogen (N), is important for the regulation of plant metabolism and  development. In addition to independent utilization of C and N nutrients, plants  sense and respond to the balance of C and N nutrients (C/N-nutrient) available to  them. High C/low N-nutrient stress has been shown to arrest early  post-germinative growth while promoting progression to senescence in Arabidopsis.  Although several signaling components of the C/N-nutrient response have been  identified, the inclusive molecular basis of plant C/N-nutrient response remains  unclear. This proteome analysis evaluated phosphorylation dynamics in response to  high C/low N-nutrient stress. Phosphoproteomics under conditions of C/N-nutrient  stress showed a global change in the phosphorylation status of proteins,  including plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase, carbon and nitrogen metabolic enzymes and  signaling proteins such as protein kinases and transcription factors. Further  analyses suggested that SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) is involved in  primary C/N-nutrient signal mediation via the transcriptional regulation of  C/N-regulatory kinases. We also identified a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like  kinase with extracellular malectin-like domain, named as LMK1, which was shown to  possess cell death induction activity in plant leaves. These results provide  important insight into the C/N-nutrient signaling pathways connecting nutrition  stress to various cellular and physiological processes in plants.', '2020', 'Front Plant Sci', '10.3389/fpls.2020.00377', 'Yamaguchi']
