Plant-generated volatiles constitute a sensitive signal of stress response, but quantitative relationships between the stress severity and volatile emissions have been demonstrated only for a few stresses. Among important stresses in the field, chilling and frost stress in spring and heat stress mid-season can significantly curb productivity. We studied the effects of cold and heat shock treatments on leaf photosynthesis and the emission of the volatile products of the lipoxygenase pathway (LOX, also called green leaf volatiles) and mono- and sesquiterpene emissions in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Mato) to gain quantitative insights into temperature stress-elicited volatile emissions. Both cold and heat stress treatments ranged from mild, which only weakly affected foliage photosynthesis, to severe, which almost completely inhibited photosynthesis. Under non-stressed conditions, LOX emissions were close to the detection limit, and terpene emissions were low. Both cold and heat stress led to enhancement of LOX emissions according to a switch-type response with essentially no emissions under mild stress and major emissions under severe stress. The emissions of mono- and sesquiterpenes increased gradually with the severity of stress, but cold stress resulted in higher sesquiterpene emissions at any given monoterpene emission level. We suggest that the quantitative relationships between the stress strength and emissions observed in this study provide an important means to characterize the severity of cold and heat stresses.
