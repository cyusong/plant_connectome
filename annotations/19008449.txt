['19008449', 'Stomata, epidermal structures that modulate gas exchange between plants and the  atmosphere, play critical roles in primary productivity and the global climate.  Positively acting transcription factors and negatively acting mitogen-activated  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling control stomatal development in Arabidopsis;  however, it is not known how the opposing activities of these regulators are  integrated. We found that a unique domain in a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)  stomatal initiating factor, SPEECHLESS, renders it a MAPK phosphorylation target  in vitro and modulates its function in vivo. MAPK cascades modulate a diverse set  of activities including development, cell proliferation, and response to external  stresses. The coupling of MAPK signaling to SPEECHLESS activity provides cell  type specificity for MAPK output while allowing the integration of multiple  developmental and environmental signals into the production and spacing of  stomata.', '2008 Nov 14', 'Science', '10.1126/science.1162263', 'Bergmann']
