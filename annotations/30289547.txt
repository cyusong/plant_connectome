['30289547', "Mitochondrial intron splicing is a plant-specific feature that was acquired  during the co-evolution of eukaryotic host cells and a-proteobacteria. The  elimination of these introns is facilitated by mitochondrial-targeted proteins  encoded by its host, nucleus. What's this factor 9 (WTF9), a nuclear-encoded  plant organelle RNA recognition (PORR) protein, is involved in the splicing of  the mitochondrial group II introns rpl2 and ccmFC. Disruption of WTF9 causes  developmental defects associated with the loss of Cyt c and Cyt c1 in  Arabidopsis. In the present study, using a co-immunoprecipitation assay, we found  that HSP60s interacted with WTF9, which was further confirmed by a pull-down  assay. HSP60s are molecular chaperones that assist with protein folding in both  eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. However, accumulating evidence suggests that  HSP60s also participate in other biological functions such as RNA metabolism and  RNA protection. In this study, we found that consistently with their interaction  with WTF9, HSP60s interacted with 48 nucleotides of the ccmFC intron. In mutant  studies, the double mutant hsp60-3a1hsp60-3b1 exhibited a small stature phenotype  and reduced splicing efficiency for rpl2 and ccmFC. These observations were  similar to those in wtf9 mutants and suggest that HSP60s are involved in the RNA  splicing of rpl2 and ccmFC introns in mitochondria. Our findings suggest that  HSP60s participate in mitochondrial RNA splicing through their RNA-binding  ability.", '2019 Jan 1', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/pcp/pcy199', 'Jauh']
