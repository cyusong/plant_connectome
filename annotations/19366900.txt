['19366900', 'Plant epidermal cells dedicate more than half of their lipid metabolism to the  synthesis of cuticular lipids, which seal and protect the plant shoot. The  cuticle is made up of a cutin polymer and waxes, diverse hydrophobic compounds  including very-long-chain fatty acids and their derivatives. How such hydrophobic  compounds are exported to the cuticle, especially through the hydrophilic plant  cell wall, is not known. By performing a reverse genetic screen, we have  identified LTPG, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored lipid transfer protein  that is highly expressed in the epidermis during cuticle biosynthesis in  Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence stems. Mutant plant lines with decreased LTPG  expression had reduced wax load on the stem surface, showing that LTPG is  involved either directly or indirectly in cuticular lipid deposition. In vitro  2-p-toluidinonaphthalene-6-sulfonate assays showed that recombinant LTPG has the  capacity to bind to this lipid probe. LTPG was primarily localized to the plasma  membrane on all faces of stem epidermal cells in the growing regions of  inflorescence stems where wax is actively secreted. These data suggest that LTPG  may function as a component of the cuticular lipid export machinery.', '2009 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.108.064451', 'Samuels']
