Meta-QTL (MQTL) analysis was done for yield-related traits in wheat. Candidate genes were identified within the refined MQTL and further validated by genotype-phenotype association analysis. Extensive studies have been undertaken on quantitative trait locus/loci (QTL) for wheat yield and its component traits. This study conducted a meta-analysis of 381 QTL related to wheat yield under various environments, including irrigated, drought- and/or heat-stressed conditions. Markers flanking meta-QTL (MQTL) were mapped on the wheat reference genome for their physical positions. Putative candidate genes were examined for MQTL with a physical interval of less than 20 Mbp. A total of 86 MQTL were identified as responsible for yield, of which 34 were for irrigated environments, 39 for drought-stressed environments, 36 for heat-stressed environments, and 23 for both drought- and heat-stressed environments. The high-confidence genes within the physical positions of the MQTL flanking markers were screened in the reference genome RefSeq V1.0, which identified 210 putative candidate genes. The phenotypic data for 14 contrasting genotypes with either high or low yield performance-according to the Australian National Variety Trials-were associated with their genotypic data obtained through ddRAD sequencing, which validated 18 genes or gene clusters associated with MQTL that had important roles for wheat yield. The detected and refined MQTL and candidate genes will be useful for marker-assisted selection of high yield in wheat breeding.
