['19945192', 'Class A heat shock factors (Hsfs) of Arabidopsis are known to function as  transcriptional activators of stress genes. Genetic and functional analysis  suggests that HsfA1a and HsfA1b are central regulators required in the early  phase of the heat shock response, which have the capacity to functionally replace  each other. In order to examine Hsf interaction in vivo, we conducted interaction  assays using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) on Arabidopsis  protoplasts co-transformed with suitable Hsf-YFP fusion genes. BiFC assays were  quantified with confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry, and  confirmed with immunoprecipitation assays. For each Hsf we could not only  demonstrate homomeric interactions but also detect heteromeric interaction  between HsfA1a and HsfA1b. Truncated versions of these of Hsfs, containing  deletions of the oligomerization domains (ODs), provided clear evidence that the  ODs are required and sufficient for the HSF interaction in vivo. By contrast  there was only homomeric but no heteromeric interaction detected between two  different class B Hsf transcription factors (HsfB1 and HsfB2b) in a yeast  two-hybrid assay. HsfB1/HsfB2b functions are not directly linked with the  expression of conventional heat shock genes; class B Hsfs are devoid of the  activation domain motif conserved in class A Hsfs. In order to identify other  proteins interacting with HsfB1 and HsfB2b we performed yeast two-hybrid  screenings of cDNA libraries. Three of the identified proteins were common to  both screenings. This suggests that HsfB1 and HsfB2b may be involved in complex  regulatory networks, which are linked to other stress responses and signaling  processes.', '2010 Feb-Mar', 'Eur J Cell Biol', '10.1016/j.ejcb.2009.10.012', 'Schoffl']
