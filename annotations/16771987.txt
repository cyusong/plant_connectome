Nutrient hot spots in the soil have a limited life span, but the costs and benefits for root foraging are still underexposed. We assessed short-term costs that may arise when a nutrient-rich patch induces root proliferation, but then rapidly disappears. Rumex palustris plants were grown with a homogeneous or a heterogeneous nutrient application. After root proliferation in a nutrient-rich patch, nutrient supply was switched from homogeneous to heterogeneous, and vice versa, or the patch location was changed. R. palustris proliferated its roots in the rich patch. After switching, the relative growth rates of the roots were adjusted to the novel pattern of nutrient availability. However, the changes in local root biomass lagged behind the rapid shift in nutrient supply, because the root mass realized in specific sectors could not be rapidly relocated. Despite this, R. palustris did not exhibit costs of switching in terms of biomass or nitrogen uptake. Our data suggest that rapid shifts in uptake rate and redistribution of nitrogen within the plant may have lowered the costs of incorrect root placement.

Nutrient hot spots: !induce! root proliferation
R. palustris: !adjusts! relative growth rates
R. palustris: !lags behind! shift in nutrient supply
R. palustris: !does not exhibit! costs of switching
Rapid shifts: !lower! costs of incorrect root placement
