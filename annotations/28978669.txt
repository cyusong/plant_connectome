The microtubule (MT)-severing enzyme katanin triggers dynamic reorientation of cortical MT arrays that play crucial functions during plant cell morphogenesis, such as cell elongation, cell wall biosynthesis, and hormonal signaling. MT severing specifically occurs at crossover or branching nucleation sites in living <i>Arabidopsis</i> cells. This differs from the random severing observed along the entire length of single MTs <i>in vitro</i> and strongly suggests that a precise control mechanism must exist <i>in vivo</i> However, how katanin senses and cleaves at MT crossover and branching nucleation sites <i>in vivo</i> has remained unknown. Here, we show that the katanin p80 subunit KTN80 confers precision to MT severing by specific targeting of the katanin p60 subunit KTN1 to MT cleavage sites and that KTN1 is required for oligomerization of functional KTN80-KTN1 complexes that catalyze severing. Moreover, our findings suggest that the katanin complex in <i>Arabidopsis</i> is composed of a hexamer of KTN1-KTN80 heterodimers that sense MT geometry to confer precise MT severing. Our findings shed light on the precise control mechanism of MT severing in plant cells, which may be relevant for other eukaryotes.
