Most cultivars of <i>Vitis vinifera</i> L. are very sensitive to cold. As an exogenous protectant, Biodegradable Liquid Film (BLF) is considered to protect winegrapes from low temperatures and dry winds for safe overwintering. This study aimed to reveal the physiological and biochemical mechanisms of BLF regulating the freezing tolerance of wine grapes. Groups of ten-year-old vines (Cabernet Sauvignon) were sprayed with BLF in November 2020 and 2021, or left untreated as a control treatment, and field plant mortality after overwintering were investigated. Branch samples were collected monthly for determination of biochemical indicators. Dormant two-year-old cuttings (Cabernet Sauvignon) were also used for the determination of relative expression levels of key genes. The results showed that the application of BLF reduced the branch semi-lethal temperature in January and February samples compared with control, and reduced the mortality of above-ground parts, branches and buds. The physiological status of shoots was greatly affected by the climatic conditions of the year, but BLF treatment increased the levels of soluble protein and soluble sugar, and also decreased the content of superoxide anion and malondialdehyde at most sampling times. Correlation analysis showed that the differences in freezing tolerance between BLF and no treated overwintering(CK) vines were mainly related to peroxidase activity, soluble sugar, reducing sugar and starch content. Low temperature stress activated the over expression of <i>ICE1</i>, <i>CBF1</i>, and <i>CBF3</i>, especially for 12h. BLF treatment significantly increased the expression levels of <i>CBF1</i> and <i>CBF3</i> under low temperature stress. Overall, these results demonstrate that BLF treatment protects vines from freezing damage by upregulating osmo-regulatory substances and alleviating oxidative damage.
