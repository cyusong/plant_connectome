<i>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</i> (common ice plant), as a nutritious ready-to-eat salad in Singapore, has become popular in recent years. However, basic data about the impacts of NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> supply on its NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> accumulation and nutritional quality are lacking. In this study, all plants were first grown indoor hydroponically in 10% artificial seawater (ASW) with modified full-strength Netherlands Standard Composition nutrient solution for 11 days, before transferring them to different reduced NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> solutions. All plants grew well and healthy after 7 days of treatment. However, plants grown with 3/4 N and 1/2 N were bigger with higher shoot and root fresh weight (FW), greater leaf number, and total leaf area (TLA) than those grown with full nitrogen (N), 1/4 N, and 0 N. <i>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</i> grown with full N, 3/4 N, and 1/4 N had similar specific leaf area (SLA), while 0 N plants had significantly lower SLA. All plants had similar leaf succulence (LS). However, leaf water content (LWC) was lower, while leaf dry matter accumulation (LDMC) was higher in 0 N plants after 7 days of treatment. Compared with plants grown with full N, shoot NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> concentrations in 3/4 N, 1/2 N, and 1/4 N plants were constant or slightly increased during the treatments. For 0 N plants, shoot NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> concentration decreased significantly during the treatment compared with other plants. Shoot NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> accumulation was associated with nitrate reductase activity (NRA). For instance, after 7 days of treatment, shoot NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> concentration and NRA on a FW basis in 0 N plants were, respectively, 45 and 31% of full N plants. After transferring full N to 0 N for 7 days, all <i>M. crystallinum</i> had higher chlorophyll (Chl) content coupled with higher electron transport rate (ETR) and higher effective quantum yield of PSII, while full N plants had higher non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The 0N plants had much higher concentrations of proline, total soluble sugar (TSS), and total ascorbic acid (ASC) than other plants. In conclusion, totally withdrawing NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> from the growth media prior to harvest could be one of the strategies to reduce shoot NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> concentration. Reduced NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> supply further enhanced nutritional values as concentrations of proline, TSS, and ASC were enhanced markedly in <i>M. crystallinum</i> plants after transferring them from full N to 0 N.
