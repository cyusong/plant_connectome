['15610354', 'Intracellular pH homeostasis is a prerequisite for biological processes and  requires the action of proton pumps. The vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) is  involved in regulating pH in endomembrane compartments of all eukaryotic cells.  In plants, there is an additional endomembrane proton pump, H(+)-pyrophosphatase  (H(+)-PPase). However, the relative roles of the two types of pumps in  endomembrane acidification and energization of secondary active transport are  unclear. Here, we show that a strong T-DNA insertion allele of VHA-A, the single  copy gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the Arabidopsis V-ATPase, causes  complete male and partial female gametophytic lethality. Severe changes in the  morphology of Golgi stacks and Golgi-derived vesicles in male gametophytes are  the first visible symptoms of cell degeneration leading to a failure to develop  mature pollen. Similar effects on Golgi morphology were observed in pollen tubes  when growth was blocked by Concanamycin A, a specific V-ATPase inhibitor. Taken  together, our results suggests that V-ATPase function is essential for Golgi  organization and development of the male gametophyte.', '2005 Jan', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2004.02282.x', 'Schumacher']
