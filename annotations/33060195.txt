Sulfur, an indispensable constituent of many cellular components, is a growth-limiting macronutrient for plants. Thus, to successfully adapt to changing sulfur availability and environmental stress, a sulfur-deficiency response helps plants to cope with the limited supply. On the transcriptional level, this response is controlled by SULFUR LIMITATION1 (SLIM1), a member of the ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3-LIKE (EIL) transcription factor family. In this study, we identified EIL1 as a second transcriptional activator regulating the sulfur-deficiency response, subordinate to SLIM1/EIL3. Our comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) allowed us to obtain a complete picture of the sulfur-deficiency response and quantify the contributions of these two transcription factors. We confirmed the key role of SLIM1/EIL3 in controlling the response, particularly in the roots, but showed that in leaves more than 50% of the response is independent of SLIM1/EIL3 and EIL1. RNA sequencing showed an additive contribution of EIL1 to the regulation of the sulfur-deficiency response but also identified genes specifically regulated through EIL1. SLIM1/EIL3 seems to have further functions (e.g. in the regulation of genes responsive to hypoxia or mediating defense at both low and normal sulfur supply). These results contribute to the dissection of mechanisms of the sulfur-deficiency response and provide additional possibilities to improve adaptation to sulfur-deficiency conditions.
