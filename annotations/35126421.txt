The mechanisms associated with the regulation of iron (Fe) homeostasis have been extensively examined, however, epigenetic regulation of these processes remains largely unknown. Here, we report that a naturally occurring epigenetic mutant, <i>Colorless non-ripening</i> (<i>Cnr</i>), displayed increased Fe-deficiency responses compared to its wild-type Ailsa Craig (AC). RNA-sequencing revealed that a total of 947 and 1,432 genes were up-regulated by Fe deficiency in AC and <i>Cnr</i> roots, respectively, while 923 and 1,432 genes were, respectively, down-regulated. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that genes encoding enzymes, transporters, and transcription factors were preferentially affected by Fe deficiency. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed differential metabolic responses to Fe deficiency between AC and <i>Cnr</i>. Based on comparative transcriptomic analyses, 24 genes were identified as potential targets of <i>Cnr</i> epimutation, and many of them were found to be implicated in Fe homeostasis. By developing CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing <i>SlSPL-CNR</i> knockout (KO) lines, we found that some <i>Cnr</i>-mediated Fe-deficiency responsive genes showed similar expression patterns between <i>SlSPL-CNR</i> KO plants and the <i>Cnr</i> epimutant. Moreover, both two KO lines displayed Fe-deficiency-induced chlorosis more severe than AC plants. Additionally, the <i>Cnr</i> mutant displayed hypermethylation in the 286-bp epi-mutated region on the <i>SlSPL-CNR</i> promoter, which contributes to repressed expression of <i>SlSPL-CNR</i> when compared with AC plants. However, Fe-deficiency induced no change in DNA methylation both at the 286-bp epi-allele region and the entire region of <i>SlSPL-CNR</i> gene. Taken together, using RNA-sequencing and genetic approaches, we identified Fe-deficiency responsive genes in tomato roots, and demonstrated that <i>SlSPL-CNR</i> is a novel regulator of Fe-deficiency responses in tomato, thereby, paving the way for further functional characterization and regulatory network dissection.
