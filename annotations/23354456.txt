The effects of antimycin A on the redox state of plastoquinone and on electron donation to photosystem I (PS I) were studied in sulfur-deprived Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells of the strains cc406 and 137c. We found that this reagent suppresses cyclic electron flow around PS I in the cc406 strain, whereas this inhibitory effect was completely absent in the 137c strain. In the latter strain, antimycin A induced rapid reduction of plastoquinone in the dark and considerably enhanced the rate of electron donation to P700 (+) in the dark. Importantly, neither myxothiazol, an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, FCCP, a protonophore, nor propyl gallate, an inhibitor of the plastid terminal oxidase, induced such a strong effect like antimycin A. The results indicate that in the chloroplast of the 137c strain, antimycin A has a site of action outside of the machinery of cyclic electron flow.
