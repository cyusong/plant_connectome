['21894193', 'Phosphatidylinositol monophosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K) catalyzes the synthesis of  PI-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) by phosphorylation of PI-4-phosphate at the  5 position of the inositol ring, and is involved in regulating multiple  developmental processes and stress responses. We here report on the functional  characterization of Arabidopsis PIP5K2, which is expressed during lateral root  initiation and elongation, and whose expression is enhanced by exogenous auxin.  The knockout mutant pip5k2 shows reduced lateral root formation, which could be  recovered with exogenous auxin, and interestingly, delayed root gravity response  that could not be recovered with exogenous auxin. Crossing with the DR5-GUS  marker line and measurement of free IAA content confirmed the reduced auxin  accumulation in pip5k2. In addition, analysis using the membrane-selective dye  FM4-64 revealed the decelerated vesicle trafficking caused by PtdIns(4,5)P(2)  reduction, which hence results in suppressed cycling of PIN proteins (PIN2 and  3), and delayed redistribution of PIN2 and auxin under gravistimulation in pip5k2  roots. On the contrary, PtdIns(4,5)P(2) significantly enhanced the vesicle  trafficking and cycling of PIN proteins. These results demonstrate that PIP5K2 is  involved in regulating lateral root formation and root gravity response, and  reveal a critical role of PIP5K2/PtdIns(4,5)P(2) in root development through  regulation of PIN proteins, providing direct evidence of crosstalk between the  phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway and auxin response, and new insights into  the control of polar auxin transport.', '2012 Mar', 'Cell Res', '10.1038/cr.2011.150', 'Xue']
