Calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK) is a class of Ser/Thr protein kinase that exists in plants and some protozoa, possessing Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing functions and kinase activity. To better reveal the roles that <i>Brassica</i> CPKs played during plant response to stresses, five <i>Brassica</i> species, namely <i>Brassica rapa</i> (<i>B. rapa</i>)<i>, Brassica nigra</i> (<i>B. nigra</i>)<i>, Brassica oleracea</i> (<i>B. oleracea</i>)<i>, Brassica juncea</i> (<i>B. juncea</i>)<i>, and Brassica napus</i> (<i>B. napus</i>) were selected and analyzed. In total, 51 <i>BraCPK</i>, 56 <i>BniCPK</i>, 56 <i>BolCPK</i>, 88 <i>BjuCPK</i>, and 107 <i>BnaCPK</i> genes were identified genome wide and phylogenetics, chromosomal mapping, collinearity, promoter analysis, and biological stress analysis were conducted. The results showed that a typical <i>CPK</i> gene was constituted by a long exon and tandem short exons. They were unevenly distributed on most chromosomes except chromosome A08 in <i>B. napus</i> and <i>B. rapa</i>, and almost all <i>CPK</i> genes were located on regions of high gene density as non-tandem form. The promoter regions of <i>BraCPKs</i>, <i>BolCPKs</i>, and <i>BnaCPKs</i> possessed at least three types of cis-elements, among which the abscisic acid responsive-related accounted for the largest proportion. In the phylogenetic tree, CPKs were clustered into four primary groups, among which group I contained the most <i>CPK</i> genes while group IV contained the fewest. Some clades, like <i>AT5G23580.1</i>(<i>CPK12</i>) and <i>AT2G31500.1</i> (<i>CPK24</i>) contained much more gene members than others, indicating a possibility that gene expansion occurred during evolution. Furthermore, 4 <i>BraCPKs</i>, 14 <i>BolCPKs</i>, and 31 <i>BnaCPKs</i> involved in the <i>Plasmodiophora brassicae</i> (<i>P. brassicae</i>) defense response in resistant (R) or susceptible (S) materials were derived from online databases, leading to the discovery that some R-specific induced <i>CPKs</i>, such as <i>BnaC02g08720D</i>, <i>BnaA03g03800D</i>, and <i>BolC04g018270.2J.m1</i> might be ideal candidate genes for <i>P. brassicae</i> resistant research. Overall, these results provide valuable information for research on the function and evolution of CDK genes.
