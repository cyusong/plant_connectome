The medicinal herbal plant Achyranthes bidentata (A. bidentata) produces the sweet-odor ester - methyl (E)-2-hexenoate (1) as the major volatile in response to methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Here, we investigated the biosynthetic pathway of methyl (E)-2-hexenoate (1). The common plant precursor (Z)-3-hexenal was only slightly metabolized into methyl (E)-2-hexenoate (1), and its application scarcely enhanced the production of this ester. By contrast, a structurally related alcohol, (Z)-2-hexenol, as well as a deuteride derivative thereof could be efficiently metabolized into methyl (E)-2-hexenoate (1). Thus, we hypothesize that A. bidentata possess a specific pathway for the production of methyl (E)-2-hexenoate (1) from (Z)-2-hexenol in response to MeJA.

MeJA: !induces! production of methyl (E)-2-hexenoate (1)
(Z)-3-hexenal: !slightly metabolized to! methyl (E)-2-hexenoate (1)
(Z)-2-hexenol: !efficiently metabolized to! methyl (E)-2-hexenoate (1)
A. bidentata: !possesses! specific pathway for production of methyl (E)-2-hexenoate (1)
