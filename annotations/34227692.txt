Salt stress is a globally increasing environmental detriment to crop growth and productivity. Exposure to salt stress evokes a complex medley of cellular signals, which rapidly reprogram transcriptional and metabolic networks to shape plant phenotype. To date, genetic engineering approaches were used with success to enhance salt tolerance; however, their performance is yet to be evaluated under realistic field conditions. Regulatory short non-coding RNAs (rsRNAs) are emerging as next-generation candidates for engineering salt tolerance in crops. In view of this, the present review provides a comprehensive analysis of a decade's worth of functional studies on non-coding RNAs involved in salt tolerance. Further, we have integrated this knowledge of rsRNA-mediated regulation with the current paradigm of salt tolerance to highlight two regulatory complexes (RCs) for regulating salt tolerance in plants. Finally, a knowledge-driven roadmap is proposed to judiciously utilize RC component(s) for enhancing salt tolerance in crops.
