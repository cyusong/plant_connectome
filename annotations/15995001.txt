We report on the molecular and biochemical characterization of HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 90C (HSP90C), one of the three Hsp90 chaperones encoded by the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome. Fractionation experiments indicate that HSP90C is a plastidic protein. In the chloroplast, HSP90C was localized to the soluble stroma fraction, but also to thylakoids and low-density membranes containing inner envelopes. HSP90C is expressed under basal conditions and is strongly induced by heat shock and moderately by light. In soluble cell extracts, HSP90C was mainly found to organize into dimers, but also into complexes of high molecular mass. Also, heterologously expressed HSP90C was mainly found in dimers, but tetramers and fewer monomers were detected, as well. HSP90C exhibits a weak ATPase activity with a Km for ATP of approximately 48 microM and a kcat of approximately 0.71 min(-1). This activity was inhibited by the Hsp90-specific inhibitor radicicol. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we found that HSP90C interacts with several proteins, among them plastidic HSP70B. The cellular concentration of HSP70B was found to be 2.9 times higher than that of HSP90C, giving a 4.8:1 stoichiometry of HSP70B monomers to HSP90C dimers. The strong inducibility of HSP90C by heat shock implies a role of the chaperone in stress management. Furthermore, its interaction with HSP70B suggests that, similar to their relatives in cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum, both chaperones might constitute the core of a multichaperone complex involved in the maturation of specific client proteins, e.g. components of signal transduction pathways.
