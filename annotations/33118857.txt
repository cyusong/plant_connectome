<i>Coniothyrium minitans</i> (synonym, <i>Paraphaeosphaeria minitans</i>) is a highly specific mycoparasite of the wide host range crop pathogen <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>. The capability of <i>C. minitans</i> to destroy the sclerotia of <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> has been well recognized and it is available as a widely used biocontrol product Contans WG. We present the draft genome sequence of <i>C. minitans</i> Conio (IMI 134523), which has previously been used in extensive studies that formed part of a registration package of the commercial product. This work provides a distinctive resource for further research into the molecular basis of mycoparasitism to harness the biocontrol potential of <i>C. minitans</i>.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
