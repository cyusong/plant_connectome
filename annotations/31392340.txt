The phytohormone auxin governs various developmental processes in plants including vascular formation. Auxin transport and biosynthesis are important factors in determining auxin distribution in tissues. Although the role of auxin transport in vein pattern formation is widely recognized, that of auxin biosynthesis in vascular development is poorly understood. Heterodimer complexes comprising two basic helix-loop-helix protein families, LONESOME HIGHWAY (LHW) and TARGET OF MONOPTEROS5 (TMO5)/TMO5-LIKE1 (T5L1), are master transcriptional regulators of the initial process of vascular development. The LHW-TMO5/T5L1 dimers regulate vascular initial cell production, vascular cell proliferation and xylem fate determination in the embryo and root apical meristem (RAM). In this study, we investigated the function of local auxin biosynthesis in initial vascular development in RAM. Results showed that LHW-T5L1 upregulated the expression of YUCCA4 (YUC4), a key auxin biosynthesis gene. The expression of YUC4 was essential for promoting xylem differentiation and vascular cell proliferation in RAM. Conversely, auxin biosynthesis was required for maintaining the expression levels of LHW, TMO5/T5L1 and their targets. Our results suggest that local auxin biosynthesis forms a positive feedback loop for fine-tuning the level of LHW-TMO5/T5L1, which is necessary for initiating vascular development.
