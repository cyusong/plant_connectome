Disturbances have altered community dynamics in boreal forests with unknown consequences for belowground ecological processes. Soil fungi are particularly sensitive to such disturbances; however, the individual response of fungal guilds to different disturbance types is poorly understood. Here, we profiled soil fungal communities in lodgepole pine forests following a bark beetle outbreak, wildfire, clear-cut logging, and salvage-logging. Using Illumina MiSeq to sequence ITS1 and SSU rDNA, we characterized communities of ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal, saprotrophic, and pathogenic fungi in sites representing each disturbance type paired with intact forests. We also quantified soil fungal biomass by measuring ergosterol. Abiotic disturbances changed the community composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi and shifted the dominance from ectomycorrhizal to saprotrophic fungi compared to intact forests. The disruption of the soil organic layer with disturbances correlated with the decline of ectomycorrhizal and the increase of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Wildfire changed the community composition of pathogenic fungi but did not affect their proportion and diversity. Fungal biomass declined with disturbances that disrupted the forest floor. Our results suggest that the disruption of the forest floor with disturbances, and the changes in C and nutrient dynamics it may promote, structure the fungal community with implications for fungal biomass-C.
