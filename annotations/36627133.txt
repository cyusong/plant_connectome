N 6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification on messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is deposited by evolutionarily conserved methyltransferases (writers). How individual m6A writers sculpt the overall landscape of the m6A methylome and the resulting biological impact in multicellular organisms remains unknown. Here, we systematically surveyed the quantitative m6A methylomes at single-nucleotide resolution and their corresponding transcriptomes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) bearing respective impaired m6A writers. The m6A sites associated with the five Arabidopsis writers were located mostly within 3' untranslated regions with peaks at around 100 bp downstream of stop codons. m6A predominantly promoted the usage of distal poly(A) sites but had little effect on RNA splicing. Notably, impaired m6A writers resulted in hypomethylation and downregulation of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins, indicating a possible correlation between m6A and protein translation. Besides the common effects on mRNA metabolism and biological functions uniquely exerted by different Arabidopsis m6A writers compared with their counterparts in human cell lines, our analyses also revealed the functional specificity of individual Arabidopsis m6A writers in plant development and response to stresses. Our findings thus reveal insights into the biological roles of various Arabidopsis m6A writers and their cognate counterparts in other multicellular m6A methyltransferase complexes.
