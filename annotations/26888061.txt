['26888061', 'The transition from a quiescent dry seed to an actively growing photoautotrophic  seedling is a complex and crucial trait for plant propagation. This study  provides a detailed description of global gene expression in seven successive  developmental stages of seedling establishment in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana). Using the transcriptome signature from these developmental stages, we  obtained a coexpression gene network that highlights interactions between known  regulators of the seed-to-seedling transition and predicts the functions of  uncharacterized genes in seedling establishment. The coexpressed gene data sets  together with the transcriptional module indicate biological functions related to  seedling establishment. Characterization of the homeodomain leucine zipper I  transcription factor AtHB13, which is expressed during the seed-to-seedling  transition, demonstrated that this gene regulates some of the network nodes and  affects late seedling establishment. Knockout mutants for athb13 showed increased  primary root length as compared with wild-type (Columbia-0) seedlings, suggesting  that this transcription factor is a negative regulator of early root growth,  possibly repressing cell division and/or cell elongation or the length of time  that cells elongate. The signal transduction pathways present during the early  phases of the seed-to-seedling transition anticipate the control of important  events for a vigorous seedling, such as root growth. This study demonstrates that  a gene coexpression network together with transcriptional modules can provide  insights that are not derived from comparative transcript profiling alone.', '2016 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.15.01704', 'ORCID:']
