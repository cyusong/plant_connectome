Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the most important food crop for at least half of the world's population. Due to improved living standards, the cultivation of high-quality rice for different purposes and markets has become a major goal. Rice quality is determined by the presence of many nutritional components, including seed storage proteins (SSPs), which are the second most abundant nutrient components of rice grains after starch. Rice SSP biosynthesis requires the participation of multiple organelles and is influenced by the external environment, making it challenging to understand the molecular details of SSP biosynthesis and improve rice protein quality. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge of rice SSP biosynthesis, including a detailed description of the key molecules involved in rice SSP biosynthetic processes and the major environmental factors affecting SSP biosynthesis. The effects of these factors on SSP accumulation and their contribution to rice quality are also discussed based on recent findings. This recent knowledge suggests not only new research directions for exploring rice SSP biosynthesis but also innovative strategies for breeding high-quality rice varieties.
