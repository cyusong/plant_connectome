Waterlogging severely affects the growth, development, and yield of crops. Accurate high-throughput phenotyping is important for exploring the dynamic crop waterlogging response in the field, and the genetic basis of waterlogging tolerance. In this study, a multi-model remote sensing phenotyping platform based on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to assess the genetic response of rapeseed (Brassica napus) to waterlogging, by measuring morphological traits and spectral indices over 2 years. The dynamic responses of the morphological and spectral traits indicated that the rapeseed waterlogging response was severe before the middle stage within 18 d after recovery, but it subsequently decreased partly. Genome-wide association studies identified 289 and 333 loci associated with waterlogging tolerance in 2 years. Next, 25 loci with at least nine associations with waterlogging-related traits were defined as highly reliable loci, and 13 loci were simultaneously identified by waterlogging tolerance coefficients of morphological traits, spectral indices, and common factors. Forty candidate genes were predicted in the regions of 13 overlapping loci. Our study provides insights into the understanding of the dynamic process and genetic basis of rapeseed waterlogging response in the field by a high-throughput UAV phenotyping platform. The highly reliable loci identified in this study are valuable for breeding waterlogging-tolerant rapeseed cultivars.
