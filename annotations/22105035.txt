The Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery is a set of multi-protein complexes that are well conserved among all eukaryotes and mediate a remarkable array of cellular processes including late endosome/multivesicular body (MVB) formation, retroviral particle release, and membrane abscission during cytokinesis. While the molecular mechanisms underlying ESCRT function have been relatively well characterized in yeasts and mammals, far less is known about ESCRT in plants. In this study, we utilized publicly-available microarray, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) and proteome data sets in order to survey the expression profiles of many of the components of the Arabidopsis thaliana ESCRT machinery. Overall, the results indicate that ESCRT expression in Arabidopsis is highly dynamic across a wide range of organs, tissues and treatments, consistent with the complex interplay that likely exists between the spatial and temporal regulation of the ESCRT machinery and the diverse array of roles that ESCRT participates in during plant growth and development.
