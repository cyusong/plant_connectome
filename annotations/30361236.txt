Although several resurrection plant genomes have been sequenced, the lack of suitable dehydration-sensitive outgroups has limited genomic insights into the origin of desiccation tolerance. Here, we utilized a comparative system of closely related desiccation-tolerant (<i>Lindernia brevidens</i>) and -sensitive (<i>Lindernia subracemosa</i>) species to identify gene- and pathway-level changes associated with the evolution of desiccation tolerance. The two high-quality <i>Lindernia</i> genomes we assembled are largely collinear, and over 90% of genes are conserved. <i>L. brevidens</i> and <i>L. subracemosa</i> have evidence of an ancient, shared whole-genome duplication event, and retained genes have neofunctionalized, with desiccation-specific expression in <i>L. brevidens</i> Tandem gene duplicates also are enriched in desiccation-associated functions, including a dramatic expansion of early light-induced proteins from 4 to 26 copies in <i>L. brevidens</i> A comparative differential gene coexpression analysis between <i>L. brevidens</i> and <i>L. subracemosa</i> supports extensive network rewiring across early dehydration, desiccation, and rehydration time courses. Many <i>LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT</i> genes show significantly higher expression in <i>L. brevidens</i> compared with their orthologs in <i>L. subracemosa</i> Coexpression modules uniquely upregulated during desiccation in <i>L. brevidens</i> are enriched with seed-specific and abscisic acid-associated <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements. These modules contain a wide array of seed-associated genes that have no expression in the desiccation-sensitive <i>L. subracemosa</i> Together, these findings suggest that desiccation tolerance evolved through a combination of gene duplications and network-level rewiring of existing seed desiccation pathways.
