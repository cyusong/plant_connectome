The quiescent center (QC) of roots consists of a rarely dividing pool of stem cells within the root apical meristem (RAM). The QC maintains the surrounding more frequently dividing initials, together constituting the stem cell niche of the RAM. The initials, after several rounds of division and differentiation, give rise to nearly all tissues necessary for root function. Hence, QC establishment, maintenance, and function are key for producing the whole plant root system and are therefore at the foundation of plant growth and productivity. Although the concept of the QC has been known since the 1950s, much of its molecular regulations and their intricate interconnections, especially in more complex root systems such as cereal RAMs, remain elusive. In Arabidopsis, molecular factors such as phytohormones, small signaling peptides and their receptors, and key transcription factors play important roles in a complex and intertwined regulatory network. In cereals, homologs of these factors are present; however, QC maintenance in the larger RAMs of cereals might also require more complex control of QC cell regulation by a combination of asymmetric and symmetric divisions. Here, we summarize current knowledge on QC maintenance in Arabidopsis and compare it with that of agriculturally relevant cereal crops.
