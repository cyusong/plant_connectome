Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy element for plant growth and development, and plants have evolved many strategies to cope with Cd stress. However, the mechanisms how plants sense Cd stress and regulate the function of transporters remain very rudimentary. Here, we found that Cd stress induces obvious Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in Arabidopsis roots. Furthermore, we identified the calcium-dependent protein kinases CPK21 and CPK23 that interacted with the Cd transporter NRAMP6 through a variety of protein interaction techniques. Then, we confirmed that the cpk21 23 double mutants significantly enhanced the sensitive phenotype of cpk23 single mutant under Cd stress, while the overexpression and continuous activation of CPK21 and CPK23 enhanced plants tolerance to Cd stress. Multiple biochemical and physiological analyses in yeast and plants demonstrated that CPK21/23 phosphorylate NRAMP6 primarily at Ser489 and Thr505 to inhibit the Cd transport activity of NRAMP6, thereby improving the Cd tolerance of plants. Taken together, we found a plasma membrane-associated calcium signaling that modulates Cd tolerance. These results provide new insights into the molecular breeding of crop tolerance to Cd stress.
