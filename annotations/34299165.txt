<i>In vitro</i> tissue culture plant regeneration is a complicated process that requires stressful conditions affecting the cell functioning at multiple levels, including signaling pathways, transcriptome functioning, the interaction between cellular organelles (retro-, anterograde), compounds methylation, biochemical cycles, and DNA mutations. Unfortunately, the network linking all these aspects is not well understood, and the available knowledge is not systemized. Moreover, some aspects of the phenomenon are poorly studied. The present review attempts to present a broad range of aspects involved in the tissue culture-induced variation and hopefully would stimulate further investigations allowing a better understanding of the phenomenon and the cell functioning.
