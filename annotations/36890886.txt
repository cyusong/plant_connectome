Polycomb group proteins (PcG) play a crucial role in developmental programs in eukaryotic organisms, including plants. PcG-mediated gene repression is achieved by epigenetic histone modification on target chromatins. Loss of PcG components leads to severe developmental defects. CURLY LEAF (CLF), a PcG component in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a repressive histone mark in numerous genes in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. In this study, we isolated a single homolog of <i>Arabidopsis</i> CLF, namely, BrCLF, in <i>Brassica rapa</i> ssp. <i>trilocularis</i>. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that BrCLF participated in <i>B. rapa</i> developmental processes, such as seed dormancy, leaf and flower organ development, and floral transition. BrCLF was also involved in stress signaling and stress-responsive metabolism, such as aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate metabolism in <i>B. rapa</i>. Epigenome analysis showed that H3K27me3 was substantially enriched in genes related to these developmental and stress-responsive processes. Thus, this study provided a basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of the PcG-mediated regulation of development and stress responses in <i>B. rapa</i>.
