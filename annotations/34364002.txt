Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich-repeat (NLR) genes comprise the largest family of plant disease-resistance genes. Angiosperm NLR genes are phylogenetically divided into the TNL, CNL, and RNL subclasses. NLR copy numbers and subclass composition vary tremendously across angiosperm genomes. However, the evolutionary associations between genomic NLR content and ecological adaptation, or between NLR content and signal transduction components, are poorly characterized because of limited genome availability. In this study, we established an angiosperm NLR atlas (ANNA, https://biobigdata.nju.edu.cn/ANNA/) that includes NLR genes from over 300 angiosperm genomes. Using ANNA, we revealed that NLR copy numbers differ up to 66-fold among closely related species owing to rapid gene loss and gain. Interestingly, NLR contraction was associated with adaptations to aquatic, parasitic, and carnivorous lifestyles. The convergent NLR reduction in aquatic plants resembles the lack of NLR expansion during the long-term evolution of green algae before the colonization of land. A co-evolutionary pattern between NLR subclasses and plant immune pathway components was also identified, suggesting that immune pathway deficiencies may drive TNL loss. Finally, we identified a conserved TNL lineage that may function independently of the EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 module. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the evolution of NLR genes in the context of ecological adaptation and genome content variation.
