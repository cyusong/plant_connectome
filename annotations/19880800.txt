In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the PMT, KRE2/MNT1, and MNN1 mannosyltransferase protein families catalyze the steps of the O-mannosylation pathway, sequentially adding mannoses to target proteins. We have identified members of all three families and analyzed their roles in pathogenesis of the maize smut fungus Ustilago maydis. Furthermore, we have shown that PMT4, one of the three PMT family members in U. maydis, is essential for tumor formation in Zea mays. Significantly, PMT4 seems to be required only for pathogenesis and is dispensable for other aspects of the U. maydis life cycle. We subsequently show that the deletion of pmt4 results in a strong reduction in the frequency of appressorium formation, with the few appressoria that do form lacking the capacity to penetrate the plant cuticle. Our findings suggest that the O-mannosylation pathway plays a key role in the posttranslational modification of proteins involved in the pathogenic development of U. maydis. The fact that PMT homologs are not found in plants may open new avenues for the development of fungal control strategies. Moreover, the discovery of a highly specific requirement for a single O-mannosyltransferase should aid in the identification of the proteins directly involved in fungal plant penetration, thus leading to a better understanding of plant-fungi interactions.
