The biogenesis of the plant thylakoid network is an enormously complex process in terms of protein targeting. The membrane system contains a large number of proteins, some of which are synthesized within the organelle, while many others are imported from the cytosol. Studies in recent years have shown that the targeting of imported proteins into and across the thylakoid membrane is particularly complex, with four different targeting pathways identified to date. Two of these are used to target membrane proteins: a signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent pathway and a highly unusual pathway that appears to require none of the known targeting apparatus. Two further pathways are used to translocate lumenal proteins across the thylakoid membrane from the stroma and, again, the two pathways differ dramatically from each other. One is a Sec-type pathway, in which ATP hydrolysis by SecA drives the transport of the substrate protein through the membrane in an unfolded conformation. The other is the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, where substrate proteins are transported in a folded state using a unique mechanism that harnesses the proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane. This article reviews progress in studies on the targeting of lumenal proteins, with reference to the mechanisms involved, their evolution from endosymbiotic progenitors of the chloroplast, and possible elements of regulation.
