Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) catalyzes a metabolic hub between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which is the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to 6-phosphogluconolactone concomitantly with the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), a reducing power. It is considered to be the rate-limiting step that governs carbon flow through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP). The OPPP is the main supplier of reductant (NADPH) for several "reducing" biosynthetic reactions. Although it is involved in multiple physiological processes, current knowledge on its exact role and regulation is still piecemeal. The present review provides a concise and comprehensive picture of the diversity of plant G6PDHs and their role in seed germination, nitrogen assimilation, plant branching, and plant response to abiotic stress. This work will help define future research directions to improve our knowledge of G6PDHs in plant physiology and to integrate this hidden player in plant performance.
