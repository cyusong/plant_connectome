['18281507', 'In plants, the circadian clock controls daily physiological cycles as well as  daylength-dependent developmental processes such as photoperiodic flowering and  seedling growth. Here, we report that FIONA1 (FIO1) is a genetic regulator of  period length in the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian clock. FIO1 was identified by  screening for a mutation in daylength-dependent flowering. The mutation  designated fio1-1 also affects daylength-dependent seedling growth. fio1-1 causes  lengthening of the free-running circadian period of leaf movement and the  transcription of various genes, including the central oscillators CIRCADIAN  CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1, LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1, and LUX  ARRHYTHMO. However, period lengthening is not dependent upon environmental light  or temperature conditions, which suggests that FIO1 is not a simple input  component of the circadian system. Interestingly, fio1-1 exerts a clear effect on  the period length of circadian rhythm but has little effect on its amplitude and  robustness. FIO1 encodes a novel nuclear protein that is highly conserved  throughout the kingdoms. We propose that FIO1 regulates period length in the  Arabidopsis circadian clock in a close association with the central oscillator  and that the circadian period can be controlled separately from amplitude and  robustness.', '2008 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.055715', 'Nam']
