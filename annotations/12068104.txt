['12068104', 'Phosphatidylglycerol is a ubiquitous phospholipid that is also present in the  photosynthetic membranes of plants. Multiple independent lines of evidence  suggest that this lipid plays a critical role for the proper function of  photosynthetic membranes and cold acclimation. In eukaryotes, different  subcellular compartments are competent for the biosynthesis of  phosphatidylglycerol. Details on the plant-specific pathways in different  organelles are scarce. Here, we describe a phosphatidylglycerol  biosynthesis-deficient mutant of Arabidopsis, pgp1. The overall content of  phosphatidylglycerol is reduced by 30%. This mutant carries a point mutation in  the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase motif of the phosphatidylglycerolphosphate  synthase (EC 2.7.8.5) isoform encoded by a gene on chromosome 2. The mutant shows  an 80% reduction in plastidic phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase activity  consistent with the plastidic location of this particular isoform. Mutant plants  are pale green, and their photosynthesis is impaired. This mutant provides a  promising new tool to elucidate the biosynthesis and function of plastidic  phosphatidylglycerol in seed plants.', '2002 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.002725', 'Benning']
