Natural genetic variations in waterlogging tolerance are controlled by multiple genes mapped as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in major crops, including soybean (Glycine max L.). In this research, 2 novel QTLs associated with waterlogging tolerance were mapped from an elite/exotic soybean cross. The subsequent research was focused on a major QTL (qWT_Gm03) with the tolerant allele from the exotic parent. This QTL was isolated into near-isogenic backgrounds, and its effects on waterlogging tolerance were validated in multiple environments. Fine mapping narrowed qWT_Gm03 into a genomic region of <380 Kbp excluding Rps1 gene for Phytophthora sojae resistance. The tolerant allele of qWT_Gm03 promotes root growth under nonstress conditions and favourable root plasticity under waterlogging, resulting in improved waterlogging tolerance, yield, and drought tolerance-related traits, possibly through more efficient water/nutrient uptakes. Meanwhile, involvement of auxin pathways was also identified in the regulation of waterlogging tolerance, as the genotypic differences of qWT_Gm03 in waterlogging tolerance and formation of adventitious/aerial roots can be complemented by an exogenous auxin-biosynthesis inhibitor. These findings provided genetic resources to address the urgent demand of improving waterlogging tolerance in soybean and revealed the determinant roles of root architecture and plasticity in the plant adaptation to waterlogging.
