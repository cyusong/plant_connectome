Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis and <i>ProACO2::GUS</i> expression showed that <i>ACO2</i> was highly expressed in the shoots of Arabidopsis seedlings under light conditions. Exogenously applied aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) enhanced the expression of <i>ACO2</i>, whereas Co<sup>2+</sup> ions suppressed its expression. In comparison with wild-type seedlings, the <i>ACO2</i> knockdown mutant <i>aco2-1</i> produced less ethylene, which resulted in the inhibited growth of Arabidopsis seedlings. Exogenously applied brassinolide reduced the expression of <i>ACO2. ACO2</i> expression was increased in <i>det2</i>, a brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutant; however, it was decreased in <i>bes1-D</i>, a brassinosteroid insensitive 1-EMS-suppressor 1 (BES1)-dominant mutant. In the putative promoter region of <i>ACO2</i>, 11 E-box sequences for BES1 binding but not BR regulatory element sequences for brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1) binding were found. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that BES1 could directly bind to the E-boxes located in the putative promoter region of <i>ACO4</i>. Less ethylene was produced in <i>bes1-D</i> seedlings compared with wild-type seedlings, suggesting that the direct binding of BES1 to the <i>ACO2</i> promoter may negatively regulate <i>ACO2</i> expression to control the endogenous level of ethylene in Arabidopsis seedlings.
