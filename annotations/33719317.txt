<i>Eucalyptus grandis</i> is one of the most important species for hardwood plantation forestry around the world. At present, its commercial deployment is in decline because of pests and pathogens such as <i>Leptocybe invasa</i> gall wasp (<i>Lepto</i>), and often co-occurring fungal stem diseases such as <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i> and <i>Teratosphaeria zuluensis</i> (<i>BotryoTera</i>). This study analyzed <i>Lepto</i>, <i>BotryoTera</i>, and stem diameter growth in an <i>E. grandis</i> multi-environmental, genetic trial. The study was established in three subtropical environments. Diameter growth and <i>BotryoTera</i> incidence scores were assessed on 3,334 trees, and <i>Lepto</i> incidence was assessed on 4,463 trees from 95 half-sib families. Using the <i>Eucalyptus</i> EUChip60K SNP chip, a subset of 964 trees from 93 half-sib families were genotyped with 14,347 informative SNP markers. We employed single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) to estimate genetic parameters in the genetic trial. Diameter and <i>Lepto</i> tolerance showed a positive genetic correlation (0.78), while <i>BotryoTera</i> tolerance had a negative genetic correlation with diameter growth (-0.38). The expected genetic gains for diameter growth and <i>Lepto</i> and <i>BotryoTera</i> tolerance were 12.4, 10, and -3.4%, respectively. We propose a genomic selection breeding strategy for <i>E. grandis</i> that addresses some of the present population structure problems.
