As one of the largest classes of lectins, legume lectins have a variety of desirable features such as antibacterial and insecticidal activities as well as anti-abiotic stress ability. The <i>Sclerotinia</i> disease (SD) caused by the soil-borne fungus <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> is a devastating disease affecting most oil crops such as <i>Brassica napus</i>. Here, we identified 130 legume lectin (<i>LegLu</i>) genes in <i>B. napus</i>, which could be phylogenetically classified into seven clusters. The <i>BnLegLu</i> gene family has been significantly expanded since the whole-genome duplication (WGD) or segmental duplication. Gene structure and conserved motif analysis suggested that the <i>BnLegLu</i> genes were well conserved in each cluster. Moreover, relative to those genes only containing the legume lectin domain in cluster VI-VII, the genes in cluster I-V harbored a transmembrane domain and a kinase domain linked to the legume lectin domain in the C terminus. The expression of most <i>BnLegLu</i> genes was relatively low in various tissues. Thirty-five <i>BnLegLu</i> genes were responsive to abiotic stress, and 40 <i>BnLegLu</i> genes were strongly induced by <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>, with a most significant up-regulation of 715-fold, indicating their functional roles in SD resistance. Four <i>BnLegLu</i> genes were located in the candidate regions of genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) results which resulted from a worldwide rapeseed population consisting of 324 accessions associated with SD. Among them, the positive role of <i>BnLegLus-16</i> in SD resistance was validated by transient expression in tobacco leaves. This study provides important information on <i>BnLegLu</i> genes, particularly about their roles in SD resistance, which may help targeted functional research and genetic improvement in the breeding of <i>B. napus</i>.
