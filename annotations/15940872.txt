The goal of the present study was to investigate whether seedlings of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) from a frost tolerant progeny (P2), were more drought tolerant than seedlings from a less frost tolerant progeny (P1). Progenies differing in freezing tolerance were identified by exposing seedlings in autumn in a large-scale trial to temperatures from -11 to -15 degrees C and scoring the degree of needle injury. Seedlings from P1 and P2 were grown from seeds for about 1 year under controlled conditions in a climatized growth room and were exposed to drought stress by withholding water for about 3 weeks. Drought caused reductions in biomass in both progenies but to a stronger extent in P1 than in P2. Seedlings of P2 were able to fully maintain root biomass. They also showed less water loss in different tissues. Decreases in quantum yield efficiency of photosystem II of dark-adapted plants occurred several days later in P2 than in P1. New proteins of molecular masses of 24.3 and 25.5 kDa appeared during drought stress. Since they occurred in both progenies a role of these proteins in progeny-related differences in drought performance is unlikely. Progeny 2 contained inherently higher superoxide dismutase and lower peroxidase activities than progeny 1. In conclusion, freezing and drought-tolerance respective -sensitivity were co-occurring traits in the spruce progenies studied here. Pre-existing high activities of enzymes protecting against oxidative stress in seedlings may have contributed to increase stress tolerance in P2 compared with P1.
