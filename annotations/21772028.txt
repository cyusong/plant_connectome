Plant myosins are required for organelle movement, and a role in actin organization has recently come to light. Myosin mutants display several gross morphological phenotypes, the most severe being dwarfism and reduced fecundity, and there is a correlation between reduced organelle movement and morphological defects. This review aims to discuss recent findings in plants relating to the role of myosins in actin dynamics, development, and organelle movement, more specifically the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). One overarching theme is that there still appear to be more questions than answers relating to plant myosin function and regulation.
