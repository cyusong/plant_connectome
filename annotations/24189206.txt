The OsWRKY genes play various roles in developmental processes and in stress-related responses in plants. We describe the rice OsWRKY gene expression profiles (GEPs) under control, hormone-treated, and water-deficit treatment (WDT) conditions. The preferential expression of 3 genes was observed in specific tissues, suggesting that these genes may play important roles in the root and panicle stages of growth. To investigate the GEPs in the root and panicle of 3 rice genotypes, we used 2 near-isogenic rice lines from a common genetic combination backcross developed by Aday Selection and IR64. WDTs were applied using the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) for severe, mild, and control conditions. Transcriptomic analysis using a 44K oligoarray from Affymetrix and Agilent was performed on all the tissues. The majority of the OsWRKY genes that were activated were activated in the drought-tolerant IR77298-14-1-2-B-10 line but not in the drought-susceptible IR77298-14-1-2-B-13 or IR64 lines. In IR77298-14-1-2-B-10, non-redundant genes (9) were very specific in their higher expression levels. Approximately 27 and 43% more genes from group III and subgroup IV-a, respectively, were activated in the panicle during severe stress than during the control treatment. We found 5 OsWRKY genes that introgressed in the drought-tolerant IR77298-14-1-2-B-10 line. Os01g43650 was up-regulated in the root under both WDTs and in the panicle under mild stress. OsWRKY up-regulated genes with tissue-specific expression patterns that contained at least 3 cis-elements in the tolerant line. These results provide a useful reference for the cloning of candidate genes for further functional analysis.
