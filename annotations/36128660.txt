The model heterocyst-forming filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (Anabaena) is a typical example of a multicellular organism capable of simultaneously performing oxygenic photosynthesis in vegetative cells and O<sub>2</sub> -sensitive N<sub>2</sub> -fixation inside heterocysts. The flavodiiron proteins have been shown to participate in photoprotection of photosynthesis by driving excess electrons to O<sub>2</sub> (a Mehler-like reaction). Here, we performed a phenotypic and biophysical characterization of Anabaena mutants impaired in vegetative-specific Flv1A and Flv3A in order to address their physiological relevance in the bioenergetic processes occurring in diazotrophic Anabaena under variable CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. We demonstrate that both Flv1A and Flv3A are required for proper induction of the Mehler-like reaction upon a sudden increase in light intensity, which is likely important for the activation of carbon-concentrating mechanisms and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> diazotrophic conditions, Flv3A is responsible for moderate O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction, independently of Flv1A, but only in the presence of Flv2 and Flv4. Strikingly, the lack of Flv3A resulted in strong downregulation of the heterocyst-specific uptake hydrogenase, which led to enhanced H<sub>2</sub> photoproduction under both oxic and micro-oxic conditions. These results reveal a novel regulatory network between the Mehler-like reaction and the diazotrophic metabolism, which is of great interest for future biotechnological applications.
