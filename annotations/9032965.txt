['9032965', 'Polar auxin transport inhibitors, including N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and  2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), have various effects on physiological and  developmental events, such as the elongation and tropism of roots and stems, in  higher plants. We isolated NPA-resistant mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, with  mutations designated pir1 and pir2, that were also resistant to TIBA. The  mutations specifically affected the root-elongation process, and they were shown  ultimately to be allelic to aux1 and ein2, respectively, which are known as  mutations that affect responses to phytohormones. The mechanism of action of  auxin transport inhibitors was investigated with these mutants, in relation to  the effects of ethylene, auxin, and the polar transport of auxin. With respect to  the inhibition of root elongation in A. thaliana, we demonstrated that (1) the  background level of ethylene intensifies the effects of auxin transport  inhibitors, (2) auxin transport inhibitors might act also via an inhibitory  pathway that does not involve ethylene, auxin, or the polar transport of auxin,  (3) the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of NPA on root elongation is due to  high-level accumulation of auxin as a result of blockage of auxin transport is  not applicable to A. thaliana, and (4) in contrast to NPA, TIBA itself has a weak  auxin-like inhibitory effect.', '1996 Dec', 'Plant Cell Physiol', '10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029059', 'Syono']
