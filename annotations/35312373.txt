SignificanceThe introduction of trees outside their native ranges has greatly expanded the potential ranges of their pathogens and insect pests, which risk spilling over and impacting native flora. However, we often lack a strong understanding of the host, climatic, and geographic factors that allow pests to establish outside their hosts' native ranges. Using global datasets of pest occurrences and the native and nonnative ranges of tree hosts, we show there are strong generalizable trends controlling pest occurrences and can predict the occurrence of pests outside their hosts' native ranges with >75% accuracy. Our modeling framework offers a powerful tool to identify future invasive pest species and the ecological mechanisms controlling the accumulation of pests outside their hosts' native ranges.
