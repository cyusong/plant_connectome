Understanding spatial and temporal patterns present in ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure is critical to understanding both the scale and duration of the potential impact these fungi have on the plant community. While recent studies consider the spatial structure of ectomycorrhizal communities, few studies consider how this changes over time. Ectomycorrhizal root biomass and the similarity of community composition were measured at scales up to 20 cm replicated in nine plots and over 3 yr. Soil cores were additionally stratified into three depths. Annual occurrence of the dominant ectomycorrhizal species was constant at larger spatial scales but varied more across years at a fine spatial scale. Turnover of ectomycorrhizal species between years was observed frequently at scales < 20 cm. The ectomycorrhizal community within a plot was more similar across years than it was to other plots sampled in the same year. Our results demonstrate the dynamic nature of the ectomycorrhizal community even in the absence of large-scale disturbances. The potential role of root turnover and drought stress is discussed.
