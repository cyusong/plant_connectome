The plant cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic component of plant cells and mainly based on microtubules (MTs), and actin filaments (AFs). The important functions of dynamic cytoskeletal networks have been indicated for almost every intracellular activity, from cell division to cell movement, cell morphogenesis and cell signal transduction. Recent studies have also indicated a close relationship between the plant cytoskeleton and plant salt stress tolerance. Salt stress is a significant factor that adversely affects crop productivity and quality of agricultural fields worldwide. The complicated regulatory mechanisms of plant salt tolerance have been the subject of intense research for decades. It is well accepted that cellular changes are very important in plant responses to salt stress. Because the organization and dynamics of cytoskeleton may play an important role in enhancing plant tolerance through various cell activities, study on salt stress-induced cytoskeletal network has been a vital topic in the subject of plant salt stress tolerance mechanisms. In this article, we introduce our recent work and review some current information on the dynamic changes and functions of cytoskeletal organization in response to salt stress. The accumulated data point to the existence of highly dynamic cytoskeletal arrays and the activation of complex cytoskeletal regulatory networks in response to salt stresses. The important role played by cytoskeleton in mediating the plant cell's response to salt stresses is particularly emphasized.
