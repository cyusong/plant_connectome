['10468559', 'The enzymes and genes of the lignin biosynthetic pathway have been studied for  several decades, but the gene encoding ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H) was cloned  only 3 years ago by T-DNA tagging in Arabidopsis. To characterize the enzyme in  detail, we have expressed F5H in yeast. According to current models of the  phenylpropanoid pathway, F5H catalyzes the hydroxylation of ferulate to  5-hydroxyferulate; however, our studies indicate that the enzyme also uses  coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol as substrates. Unexpectedly, the K(m)  values measured for the latter two substrates are three orders of magnitude lower  than that measured for ferulic acid, suggesting that in lignifying tissues,  syringyl monomers may be derived from their guaiacyl counterparts by  hydroxylation and subsequent methylation. Thus, F5H may function later in the  lignin biosynthetic pathway than was originally proposed. To further test this  model, recombinant F5H was incubated together with ferulic acid, coniferaldehyde,  or coniferyl alcohol in the presence of native or recombinant Arabidopsis caffeic  acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid O-methyltransferase and [(14)C]S-adenosylmethionine.  In all cases, the corresponding radiolabeled sinapyl derivatives were  synthesized, indicating that the necessary enzymes required for this pathway are  present in Arabidopsis. Taken together, these data suggest that the previously  accepted pathway for lignin biosynthesis is likely to be incorrect.', '1999 Aug 31', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.96.18.10045', 'Chapple']
