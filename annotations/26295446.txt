A trade-off between pathogenicity and transmission is often postulated to explain the persistence of pathogens over time. If demonstrated, it would help to predict the evolution of pathogenicity across cropping seasons, and to develop sustainable control strategies from this prediction. Unfortunately, experimental demonstration of such trade-offs in agricultural plant pathogens remains elusive. We measured asexual transmission of Phytophthora infestans isolates differing in pathogenicity in two sets of artificial infection experiments under controlled, semi-outdoor conditions. Higher foliar pathogenicity decreased mean daughter tuber weight, increased infection severity in daughter tubers, and increased stem mortality before emergence. The most pathogenic isolates thus suffer a double penalty for asexual transmission: a lower survival probability within small and severely infected tubers; and a lower infection probability of neighbouring healthy plants due to fewer infected stems produced by surviving tubers. Moderate tuber resistance favoured transmission of the least pathogenic isolates, while high levels of resistance almost abolished transmission of all isolates. These data demonstrate a trade-off between foliar pathogenicity and asexual transmission over seasons in P. infestans, which should stabilise pathogenicity over time in the potato late blight pathosystem and possibly favour clone replacement by less pathogenic lineages after demographic bottlenecks.
