Cell-to-cell communication is essential for plant development and adaptation to environmental changes. As a strategy for efficient intercellular communication, plants have evolved a plant-specific symplasmic network connected via plasmodesmata that allows a locally restricted information exchange from cell to cell. A rapid information transfer over long distances is enabled via the phloem transport tubes that pervade the complete plant and thus connect even the most distant organs. While communication by small molecules like metabolites and phytohormones is comparably well studied, the intercellular trafficking of proteins and RNAs has only recently emerged as a novel mechanism of cell-to-cell and long-distance signalling in plants. In particular the non-cell-autonomous and systemic transport pathway for specific RNAs seems to play a key role in the co-ordination of important physiological processes, including virus defence, gene silencing, regulation of development, and nutrient allocation. This review is a summary of the current knowledge on RNAs contained in the phloem long-distance transport system, their transport mechanism, and their potential functions.
