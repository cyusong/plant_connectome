['9461286', 'The vertebrate high-mobility-group (HMG) protein HMG1 is an abundant non-histone  protein which is considered as an architectural element in chromatin. In the  monocotyledonous plant maize, four different HMG1-like proteins (HMGa, HMGc1/2,  HMGd) have been identified, whereas other eukaryotes usually express only two  different proteins of this type. We have examined here the HMG1-like proteins of  the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The isolation and analysis of  cDNAs encoding five different so far uncharacterised HMG1-like proteins (now  termed HMG alpha, HMG beta1/2, HMG gamma, HMG delta) from Arabidopsis indicates  that the expression of multiple HMG1-like proteins is a general feature of  (higher) plants. The Arabidopsis HMG1-like proteins contain an HMG domain as a  common feature, but outside this conserved DNA-binding motif the amino acid  sequences are significantly different indicating that this protein family  displays a greater structural variability in plants than in other eukaryotes. The  five HMG1-like proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. They  bind with somewhat different affinity to linear double-stranded DNA. The  recognition of DNA structure is evident from their preferential interaction with  DNA minicircles relative to linear DNA. Reverse-transcribed PCR suggested that  the five HMG1-like genes are simultaneously expressed in Arabidopsis leaves and  suspension culture cells.', '1997 Dec 15', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00646.x', 'Grasser']
