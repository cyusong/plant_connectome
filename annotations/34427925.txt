['34427925', 'Proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases (PERKs) belong to the  hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) superfamily known to be involved in many  plant developmental processes. Here, we characterized two pollen-expressed PERKs  from Arabidopsis thaliana, PERK5 and PERK12. Pollen tube growth was impaired in  single and double perk5-1 perk12-1 loss of function mutants, with an impact on  seed production. When the segregation was analysed, a male gametophytic defect  was found, indicating that perk5-1 and perk12-1 mutants carry deficient pollen  transmission. Furthermore, perk5-1 perk12-1 displayed an excessive accumulation  of pectins and cellulose at the cell wall of the pollen tubes. Our results  indicate that PERK5 and PERK12 are necessary for proper pollen tube growth,  highlighting their role in cell wall assembly and reactive oxygen species  homeostasis.', '2021 Oct', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1002/1873-3468.14185', 'ORCID:']
