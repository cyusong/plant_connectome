When plants are subjected to a deficiency in inorganic phosphate (Pi), they exhibit an array of responses to cope with this nutritional stress. In this work, we have characterized two Arabidopsis mutants, hps3-1 and hps3-2 (hypersensitive to Pi starvation 3), that have altered expression of Pi starvation-induced (PSI) genes and enhanced production of acid phosphatase (APase) when grown under either Pi sufficiency or deficiency conditions. hps3-1 and hps3-2, however, accumulate less anthocyanin than the wild type when grown on a Pi-deficient medium. Molecular cloning indicated that the phenotypes of hps3 mutants were caused by mutations within the ETO1 (ETHYLENE OVERPRODUCTION 1) gene. In Arabidopsis, ETO1 encodes a negative regulator of ethylene biosynthesis, and mutation of ETO1 causes Arabidopsis seedlings to overproduce ethylene. The ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinyl glycine or the ethylene perception inhibitor Ag(+) suppressed all the mutant phenotypes of hps3. Taken together, these results provide further genetic evidence that ethylene is an important regulator of multiple plant responses to Pi starvation. Furthermore, we found that a change in ethylene level has differential effects on the expression of PSI genes, maintenance of Pi homeostasis, production of APase and accumulation of anthocyanin. We also demonstrated that ethylene signaling mainly regulates the activity of root surface-associated APases rather than total APase activity.
