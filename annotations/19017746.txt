Proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells must be folded correctly before translocation out of the ER. Disruption of protein folding results in the induction of genes for ER-resident chaperones, for example, BiP. This phenomenon is known as the ER stress response. We report here that bZIP60, an Arabidopsis thaliana basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor with a transmembrane domain, is involved in the ER stress response. When compared with wild-type Arabidopsis plants, homozygous bzip60 mutant plants show a markedly weaker induction of many ER stress-responsive genes. The bZIP60 protein resides in the ER membrane under unstressed condition and is cleaved in response to ER stress caused by either tunicamycin or DTT. The N-terminal fragment containing the bZIP domain is then translocated into the nucleus. Cleavage of bZIP60 is independent of the function of Arabidopsis homologs of mammalian S1P and S2P proteases, which mediate the proteolytic cleavage of the mammalian transcription factor ATF6. In Arabidopsis, expression of the bZIP60 gene and cleavage of the bZIP60 protein are observed in anthers in the absence of stress treatment, suggesting that the ER stress response functions in the normal development of active secretory cells.
