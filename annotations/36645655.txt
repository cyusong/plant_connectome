The endomembrane system, extending from the nuclear envelope to the plasma membrane, is critical to the plant response to pathogen infection. Synthesis and transport of immunity-related proteins and antimicrobial compounds to and from the plasma membrane are supported by conventional and unconventional processes of secretion and internalization of vesicles, guided by the cytoskeleton networks. Although plant bacterial pathogens reside mostly in the apoplast, major structural and functional modifications of the endomembrane system in the host cell occur during bacterial infection. Here, we review the dynamics of these cellular compartments, briefly, for their essential contributions to the plant defense responses and, in parallel, for their emerging roles in bacterial pathogenicity. We further focus on <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, <i>Xanthomonas</i> spp., and <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> type III secreted effectors that one or both localize to and associate with components of the host endomembrane system or the cytoskeleton network to highlight the diversity of virulence strategies deployed by bacterial pathogens beyond the inhibition of the secretory pathway.
