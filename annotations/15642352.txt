['15642352', 'In plants, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH)-deficiency results in the  accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), necrotic lesions, dwarfism,  and hypersensitivity to environmental stresses. We report that Arabidopsis ssadh  knockout mutants contain five times the normal level of gamma-hydroxybutyrate  (GHB), which in SSADH-deficient mammals accounts for phenotypic abnormalities.  Moreover, the level of GHB in Arabidopsis is light dependent. Treatment with  gamma-vinyl-gamma-aminobutyrate, a specific gamma-aminobutyrate  (GABA)-transaminase inhibitor, prevents the accumulation of ROI and GHB in ssadh  mutants, inhibits cell death, and improves growth. These results provide novel  evidence for the relationship between the GABA shunt and ROI, which may, in part,  explain the phenotype of SSADH-deficient plants and animals.', '2005 Jan 17', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2004.12.004', 'Fromm']
