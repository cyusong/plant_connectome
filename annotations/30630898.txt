Baccini <i>et al</i> (Reports, 13 October 2017, p. 230) report MODIS-derived pantropical forest carbon change, with spatial patterns of carbon loss that do not correspond to higher-resolution Landsat-derived tree cover loss. The assumption that map results are unbiased and free of commission and omission errors is not supported. The application of passive moderate-resolution optical data to monitor forest carbon change overstates our current capabilities.

MODIS: !derives! Forest Carbon Change
Landsat: !derives! Tree Cover Loss
Map Results: !unbiased and free of! Commission/Omission Errors
Passive Moderate-Resolution Optical Data: !monitors! Forest Carbon Change
