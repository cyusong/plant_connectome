<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> causes blast disease on more than 50 species of monocot plants, including important crops such as rice, millet, and most recently wheat. Additionally, it is an important model system for studying host-pathogen interaction. Here, we report a high-quality genome assembly and annotation of a laboratory strain 2539 of <i>M. oryzae</i>, which is a widely used progeny of a rice-infecting isolate and a grass-infecting isolate. The genome sequence of strain 2539 will be useful for studying the evolution, host adaption, and pathogenicity of <i>M. oryzae</i>, which will be beneficial for a better understanding of the mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction.
