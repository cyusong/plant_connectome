['24714496', 'Membrane trafficking is essential to fundamental processes in eukaryotic life,  including cell growth and division. In plant cytokinesis, post-Golgi trafficking  mediates a massive flow of vesicles that form the partitioning membrane but its  regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify functionally redundant  Arabidopsis ARF guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (ARF-GEFs) BIG1-BIG4 as  regulators of post-Golgi trafficking, mediating late secretion from the  trans-Golgi network but not recycling of endocytosed proteins to the plasma  membrane, although the TGN also functions as an early endosome in plants. In  contrast, BIG1-4 are absolutely required for trafficking of both endocytosed and  newly synthesized proteins to the cell-division plane during cytokinesis,  counteracting recycling to the plasma membrane. This change from recycling to  secretory trafficking pathway mediated by ARF-GEFs confers specificity of cargo  delivery to the division plane and might thus ensure that the partitioning  membrane is completed on time in the absence of a cytokinesis-interphase  checkpoint.
