['16372013', 'Plants continuously maintain pools of totipotent stem cells in their apical  meristems from which elaborate root and shoot systems are produced. In  Arabidopsis thaliana, stem cell fate in the shoot apical meristem is controlled  by a regulatory network that includes the CLAVATA (CLV) ligand-receptor system  and the homeodomain protein WUSCHEL (WUS). Phytohormones such as auxin and  cytokinin are also important for meristem regulation. Here we show a mechanistic  link between the CLV/WUS network and hormonal control. WUS, a positive regulator  of stem cells, directly represses the transcription of several two-component  ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR genes (ARR5, ARR6, ARR7 and ARR15), which act in  the negative-feedback loop of cytokinin signalling. These data indicate that ARR  genes might negatively influence meristem size and that their repression by WUS  might be necessary for proper meristem function. Consistent with this hypothesis  is our observation that a mutant ARR7 allele, which mimics the active,  phosphorylated form, causes the formation of aberrant shoot apical meristems.  Conversely, a loss-of-function mutation in a maize ARR homologue was recently  shown to cause enlarged meristems.', '2005 Dec 22', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature04270', 'Lohmann']
