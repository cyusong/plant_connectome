['26140942', "The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 58 membrane proteins belonging to the  mitochondrial carrier family. Three members of this family, here named AtAPC1,  AtAPC2, and AtAPC3, exhibit high structural similarities to the human  mitochondrial ATP-Mg(2+)/phosphate carriers. Under normal physiological  conditions the AtAPC1 gene was expressed at least five times more than the other  two AtAPC genes in flower, leaf, stem, root and seedlings. However, in stress  conditions the expression levels of AtAPC1 and AtAPC3 change. Direct transport  assays with recombinant and reconstituted AtAPC1, AtAPC2 and AtAPC3 showed that  they transport phosphate, AMP, ADP, ATP, adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate and, to a  lesser extent, other nucleotides. AtAPC2 and AtAPC3 also had the ability to  transport sulfate and thiosulfate. All three AtAPCs catalyzed a counter-exchange  transport that was saturable and inhibited by pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. The  transport activities of AtAPCs were also inhibited by the addition of EDTA or  EGTA and stimulated by the addition of Ca(2+). Given that phosphate and sulfate  can be recycled via their own specific carriers, these findings indicate that  AtAPCs can catalyze net transfer of adenine nucleotides across the inner  mitochondrial membrane in exchange for phosphate (or sulfate), and that this  transport is regulated both at the transcriptional level and by Ca(2+).", '2015 Oct', 'Biochim Biophys Acta', '10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.06.015', 'Palmieri']
