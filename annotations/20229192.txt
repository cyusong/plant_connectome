['20229192', 'Pectin methylesterase (PME) is known to have important roles in pollen  development and pollen tube growth. As pivotal regulatory factors in PME activity  modulation, PME inhibitors (PMEIs) are thought to be key regulators of cell wall  stability at the tip of the pollen tube. We report on the cloning and  characterization of a novel B. oleracea PMEI gene, BoPMEI1. Heterologously  expressed BoPMEI1 showed PMEI activity. RT-PCR studies of different tissues and  promoter-GUS fusions confirmed that BoPMEI1 was specifically expressed in mature  pollen grains and pollen tubes. Based on in vivo transient assays, we found that  BoPMEI1 appears to be largely localized to the plasma membrane. Transgenic  Arabidopsis plants expressing antisense BoPMEI1 under the control of the CaMV 35S  promoter suppressed the expression of the orthologous gene At1g10770, which led  to partial male sterility and decreased seed set by inhibition of pollen tube  growth. Our study demonstrates the involvement of BoPMEI1 in pollen tube growth.', '2010 May', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-010-1136-7', 'Wang']
