Biomass and area ratios between leaves, stems and roots regulate many physiological and ecological processes. The Huber value H<sub>v</sub> (sapwood area/leaf area ratio) is central to plant water balance and drought responses. However, its coordination with key plant functional traits is poorly understood, and prevents developing trait-based prediction models. Based on theoretical arguments, we hypothesise that global patterns in H<sub>v</sub> of terminal woody branches can be predicted from variables related to plant trait spectra, that is plant hydraulics and size and leaf economics. Using a global compilation of 1135 species-averaged H<sub>v</sub> , we show that H<sub>v</sub> varies over three orders of magnitude. Higher H<sub>v</sub> are seen in short small-leaved low-specific leaf area (SLA) shrubs with low K<sub>s</sub> in arid relative to tall large-leaved high-SLA trees with high K<sub>s</sub> in moist environments. All traits depend on climate but climatic correlations are stronger for explanatory traits than H<sub>v</sub> . Negative isometry is found between H<sub>v</sub> and K<sub>s</sub> , suggesting a compensation to maintain hydraulic supply to leaves across species. This work identifies the major global drivers of branch sapwood/leaf area ratios. Our approach based on widely available traits facilitates the development of accurate models of above-ground biomass allocation and helps predict vegetation responses to drought.
