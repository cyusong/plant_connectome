Membrane proteins that are imported into chloroplasts must be accurately routed in order to establish and maintain the highly differentiated membranes characteristic of these organelles. Little is known about the targeting information or pathways involved, especially in the case of proteins with multiple transmembrane domains. We have studied targeting of the SCY components of the two SEC translocases in chloroplasts. SCY1 and SCY2 share a similar, highly conserved structure with 10 transmembrane domains, but are targeted to different membranes: the thylakoids and inner envelope, respectively. We used protoplast transfections and a confocal microscopy imaging assay in combination with a domain-swapping approach to investigate sorting pathways and identify important targeting elements in these proteins. We show that the N-terminal region of SCY1 contains targeting determinants that allow SCY1 to be recruited to the signal-recognition particle pathway. In addition, substituting the N-terminal region of SCY1 for the N-terminal region of SCY2 causes SCY2 to be displaced out of the inner envelope. The region of SCY2 that contains transmembrane domains 3 and 4 is necessary for localization to the inner envelope and may serve as a membrane anchor, enhancing the integration of other transmembrane domains via either stop-transfer or post-import mechanisms.

SCY1: !contains targeting determinants! Signal-recognition particle pathway
SCY2: !contains membrane anchor! Inner envelope
SCY1: !displaced by! N-terminal region of SCY2
SCY2: !localized to! Transmembrane domains 3 and 4
