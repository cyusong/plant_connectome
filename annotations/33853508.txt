Light is an important environmental factor for plant growth and development. Phytochrome B (phyB), a classical red/far-red light receptor, plays vital role in controlling plant photomorphogenesis and light-induced stomatal opening. Phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) accumulates rapidly and triggers a series of physiological and molecular events during the responses to multiple abiotic stresses. Recent studies showed that <i>phyB</i> mutant synthesizes more ABA and exhibits improved tolerance to salt and cold stress, suggesting that a crosstalk exists between light and ABA signaling pathway. However, whether ABA signaling components mediate responses to light remains unclear. Here, we showed that SnRK2.6 (Sucrose Nonfermenting 1-Related Protein Kinase 2.6), a key regulator in ABA signaling, interacts with phyB and participates in light-induced stomatal opening. First, we checked the interaction between phyB and SnRK2s, and found that SnRK2.2/2.3/2.6 kinases physically interacted with phyB in yeast and <i>in vitro</i>. We also performed co-IP assay to support that SnRK2.6 interacts with phyB in plant. To investigate the role of SnRK2.6 in red light-induced stomatal opening, we obtained the <i>snrk2.6</i> mutant and overexpression lines, and found that <i>snrk2.6</i> mutant exhibited a significantly larger stomatal aperture under red light treatment, while the two independent overexpression lines showed significantly smaller stomatal aperture, indicative of a negative role for SnRK2.6 in red light-induced stomatal opening. The interaction of SnRK2.6 with red light receptor and the negative role of SnRK2.6 in red light-induced stomatal opening provide new evidence for the crosstalk between ABA and red light in guard cell signaling.
