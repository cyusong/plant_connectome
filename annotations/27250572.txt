Development and ripening of tomato fruit are precisely controlled by transcriptional regulation, which depends on the orchestrated accessibility of regulatory proteins to promoters and other cis-regulatory DNA elements. This accessibility and its effect on gene expression play a major role in defining the developmental process. To understand the regulatory mechanism and functional elements modulating morphological and anatomical changes during fruit development, we generated genome-wide high-resolution maps of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) from the fruit tissues of the tomato cultivar "Moneymaker" at 20 days post anthesis as well as break stage. By exploring variation of DHSs across fruit development stages, we pinpointed the most likely hypersensitive sites related to development-specific genes. By detecting binding motifs on DHSs of these development-specific genes or genes in the ascorbic acid biosynthetic pathway, we revealed the common regulatory elements contributing to coordinating gene transcription of plant ripening and specialized metabolic pathways. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the regulatory dynamics of genes involved in tomato fruit development and ripening.
