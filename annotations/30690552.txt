Great strides have been made in understanding how membranes and lipid droplets are formed and maintained in land plants, yet much more is to be learned given the complexity of plant lipid metabolism. A complicating factor is the multi-organellar presence of biosynthetic enzymes and unique compositional requirements of different membrane systems. This necessitates a rich network of transporters and transport mechanisms that supply fatty acids, membrane lipids and storage lipids to their final cellular destination. Though we know a large number of the biosynthetic enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis and a few transport proteins, the regulatory mechanisms, in particular, coordinating expression and/or activity of the majority remain yet to be described. Plants undergoing stress alter their membranes' compositions, and lipids such as phosphatidic acid have been implicated in stress signaling. Additionally, lipid metabolism in chloroplasts supplies precursors for jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, and perturbations in lipid homeostasis has consequences on JA signaling. In this review, several aspects of plant lipid metabolism are discussed that are currently under investigation: cellular transport of lipids, regulation of lipid biosynthesis, roles of lipids in stress signaling, and lastly the structural and oligomeric states of lipid enzymes.
