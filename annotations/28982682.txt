In plants, aerial organs are initiated at stereotyped intervals, both spatially (every 137° in a pattern called phyllotaxis) and temporally (at prescribed time intervals called plastochrons). To investigate the molecular basis of such regularity, mutants with altered architecture have been isolated. However, most of them only exhibit plastochron defects and/or produce a new, albeit equally reproducible, phyllotactic pattern. This leaves open the question of a molecular control of phyllotaxis regularity. Here, we show that phyllotaxis regularity depends on the function of VIP proteins, components of the RNA polymerase II-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1c). Divergence angles between successive organs along the stem exhibited increased variance in <i>vip3-1</i> and <i>vip3-2</i> compared with the wild type, in two different growth conditions. Similar results were obtained with the weak <i>vip3-6</i> allele and in <i>vip6</i>, a mutant for another Paf1c subunit. Mathematical analysis confirmed that these defects could not be explained solely by plastochron defects. Instead, increased variance in phyllotaxis in <i>vip3</i> was observed at the meristem and related to defects in spatial patterns of auxin activity. Thus, the regularity of spatial, auxin-dependent, patterning at the meristem requires Paf1c.
