Cytoplasmic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) transients and nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations act as hubs during root nodulation and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses. Plants perceive bacterial Nod factors or fungal signals to induce the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation in the nucleus of root hair cells, and subsequently activate calmodulin (CaM) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK). Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CaM-bound CCaMK phosphorylate transcription factors then initiate down-stream signaling events. In addition, distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> signatures are activated at different symbiotic stages: microbial colonization and infection; nodule formation; and mycorrhizal development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts as a key signal that regulates a complex interplay of downstream responses in many biological processes. This short review focuses on advances in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-regulated symbiotic events. It is meant to be an introduction to readers in and outside the field of bacterial and fungal symbioses. We summarize the molecular mechanisms underlying Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-mediated signaling in fine-tuning both local and systemic symbiotic events.
