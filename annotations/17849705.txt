Detection of potentially infectious microorganisms is essential for plant immunity. Microbial communities growing on plant surfaces are constantly monitored according to their conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). In recent years, several pattern-recognition receptors, including receptor-like kinases and receptor-like proteins, and their contribution to disease resistance have been described. MAMP signaling must be carefully controlled and seems to involve receptor endocytosis. As a further surveillance layer, plants are able to specifically recognize microbial effector molecules via nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat receptors (NB-LRR). A number of recent studies show that NB-LRR translocate to the nucleus in order to exert their activity. In this review, current knowledge regarding the recognition of MAMPs by surface receptors, receptor activation, signaling, and subcellular redistribution are discussed.
