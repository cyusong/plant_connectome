Powdery mildew (PM) is a severe fungal disease of cultivated grapevine world-wide. Proanthocyanidins (PAs) play an important role in resistance to fungal pathogens; however, little is known about PA-mediated PM resistance in grapevine. We identified a WRKY transcription factor, VqWRKY56, from Vitis quinquangularis, the expression of which was significantly induced by PM. Overexpression (OE) of VqWRKY56 in Vitis vinifera increased PA content and reduced susceptibility to PM. Furthermore, the transgenic plants showed more cell death and increased accumulation of salicylic acid and reactive oxygen species. Transient silencing of VqWRKY56 in V. quinquangularis and V. vinifera reduced PA accumulation and increased the susceptibility to PM. VqWRKY56 interacted with VqbZIPC22 in vitro and in planta. The protein VqWRKY56 can bind to VvCHS3, VvLAR1, and VvANR promoters, and VqbZIPC22 can bind to VvANR promoter. Co-expression of VqWRKY56 and VqbZIPC22 significantly increased the transcript level of VvCHS3, VvLAR1, and VvANR genes. Finally, transient OE of VqbZIPC22 in V. vinifera promoted PA accumulation and improved resistance to PM, while transient silencing in V. quinquangularis had the opposite effect. Our study provides new insights into the mechanism of PA regulation by VqWRKY56 in grapevine and provides a basis for further metabolic engineering of PA biosynthesis to improve PM resistance.
