Protein-protein interactions are at the core of cellular interactomics and are essential for various biological functions. Since proteins commonly function as macromolecular complexes, it is important to identify their interacting partners to better understand their function and the significance in these interactions. The acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs) of eukaryotes show conservation in the presence of a lipid-binding acyl-CoA-binding domain. In Arabidopsis thaliana, four of six members from the AtACBP family possess ankyrin repeats (AtACBP1 and AtACBP2) or kelch motifs (AtACBP4 and AtACBP5), which can potentially mediate protein-protein interactions. Through yeast two-hybrid screens, a dozen putative protein partners interacting with AtACBPs have been isolated from an Arabidopsis cDNA library. Investigations in the past decade on the interaction between AtACBPs and their protein partners have revealed novel roles for AtACBPs, including functions in mediating oxidative stress responses, heavy metal tolerance and oxygen sensing. Recent progress and current questions on AtACBPs and their interactors are discussed in this review.
