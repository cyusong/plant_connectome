Oxylipin metabolism represents one of many defence mechanisms employed by plants. It begins with the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by lipoxygenases to form fatty acid hydroperoxides that are substrates for several enzymes, including specialized cytochrome P450s known as CYP74s. The targeting of a new CYP74, a 9-hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) from almonds, to the endomembrane system and lipid bodies, both as enzyme activity in almond seeds and as GFP fusions transiently expressed in tobacco protoplasts, is described. Such association of a CYP74 with lipid bodies has not been reported previously. Also described are the properties of a 9-HPL gene, the developmental regulation of its expression, the production and characterization of recombinant 9-HPL in Escherichia coli, and the developmental correlation between gene expression, enzyme activity, and the appearance of volatile C9 aldehydes from HPL action.
