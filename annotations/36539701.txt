Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important stress hormone, the changes of abscisic acid content can alter plant tolerance to stress, abscisic acid is crucial for studying plant responses to abiotic stress. The abscisic acid aldehyde oxidase (AAO) plays a vital role in the final step in the synthesis of abscisic acid, therefore, understanding the function of AAO gene family is of great significance for plants to response to abiotic stresses. In this study, 6, 8, 4 and 4 AAO genes were identified in four cotton species. According to the structural characteristics of genes and the traits of phylogenetic tree, we divided the AAO gene family into 4 clades. Gene structure analysis showed that the AAO gene family was relatively conservative. The analysis of cis-elements showed that most AAO genes contained cis-elements related to light response and plant hormones. Tissue specificity analysis under NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress showed that GhAAO2 gene was differentially expressed in both roots and leaves. After GhAAO2 gene silencing, the degree of wilting of seedlings was lighter than that of the control group, indicating that GhAAO2 could respond to NaHCO<sub>3</sub> stress. In this study, the AAO gene family was analyzed by bioinformatics, the response of GhAAO gene to various abiotic stresses was preliminarily verified, and the function of the specifically expressed gene GhAAO2 was further verified. These findings provide valuable information for the study of potential candidate genes related to plant growth and stress.
