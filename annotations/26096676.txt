miR156 is an evolutionarily highly conserved miRNA in plants that defines an age-dependent flowering pathway. The investigations thus far have largely, if not exclusively, confined to plant aerial organs. Root branching architecture is a major determinant of water and nutrients uptake for plants. We show here that MIR156 genes are differentially expressed in specific cells/tissues of lateral roots. Plants overexpressing miR156 produce more lateral roots whereas reducing miR156 levels leads to fewer lateral roots. We demonstrate that at least one representative from the three groups of miR156 targets SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes: SPL3, SPL9 and SPL10 are involved in the repression of lateral root growth, with SPL10 playing a dominant role. In addition, both MIR156 and SPLs are responsive to auxin signaling suggesting that miR156/SPL modules might be involved in the proper timing of the lateral root developmental progression. Collectively, these results unravel a role for miR156/SPLs modules in lateral root development in Arabidopsis.
