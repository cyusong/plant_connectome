Light and ABA independently regulated anthocyanin biosynthesis via activation of FaMYB10 expression. FaMYB10 accelerated anthocyanin synthesis of pelargonidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside during strawberry fruit ripening. Light is an integral factor in fruit ripening. Ripening in non-climacteric fruit is also effected by the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). However, how light and/or ABA regulate fruit ripening processes, such as strawberry color development remains elusive. Results of the present study showed light and ABA regulated strawberry fruit coloration via activation of FaMYB10 expression, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor. Light exposure increased FaMYB10 transcript levels, flavonoid pathway genes, and anthocyanin content. Exogenous ABA promoted FaMYB10 expression, and anthocyanin content, accompanied by increased ABA-responsive transcript levels and flavonoid pathway genes. ABA biosynthesis inhibitor treatment, and RNAi-mediated down-regulation of the ABA biosynthetic gene (9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase: FaNCED1), and ABA receptor (magnesium chelatase H subunit: FaCHLH/ABAR) showed inverse ABA effects. Furthermore, additive effects were observed in anthocyanin accumulation under combined light and ABA, indicating independent light and ABA signaling pathways. FaMYB10 down-regulation by Agrobacterium-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) in strawberry fruits showed decreased pelargonidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside levels, accompanied by consistent flavonoid pathway gene expression levels. FaMYB10 over-expression showed opposite FaMYB10 RNAi phenotypes, particularly cyanidin 3-glucoside synthesis by FaMYB10, which was correlated with FaF3'H transcript levels. These data provided evidence that light and ABA promoted FaMYB10 expression, resulting in anthocyanin accumulation via acceleration of flavonoid pathway gene expression. Finally, our results suggested FaMYB10 serves a role as a signal transduction mediator from light and ABA perception to anthocyanin synthesis in strawberry fruit.
