['29018096', 'Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of  diverse biological processes, including environmental stress responses in plants.  Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor  (HDI) that confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In this  study, we demonstrate that class I HDAC (HDA19) and class II HDACs  (HDA5/14/15/18) control responses to salt stress through different pathways. The  screening of 12 different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs  enhance salt tolerance. Genetic analysis, based on a pharmacological study,  identified which HDACs function in salinity stress tolerance. In the wild-type  Columbia-0 background, hda19 plants exhibit tolerance to high-salinity stress,  while hda5/14/15/18 plants exhibit hypersensitivity to salt stress. Transcriptome  analysis revealed that the effect of HDA19 deficiency on the response to salinity  stress is distinct from that of HDA5/14/15/18 deficiencies. In hda19 plants, the  expression levels of stress tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant  proteins that prevent protein aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5  and NAC019 in abscisic acid signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild  type. Neither of these elements was up-regulated in the hda5/14/15/18 plants. The  mutagenesis of HDA19 by genome editing in the hda5/14/15/18 plants enhanced salt  tolerance, suggesting that suppression of HDA19 masks the phenotype caused by the  suppression of class II HDACs in the salinity stress response. Collectively, our  results demonstrate that HDIs that inhibit class I HDACs allow the rescue of  plants from salinity stress regardless of their selectivity, and they provide  insight into the hierarchal regulation of environmental stress responses through  HDAC isoforms.', '2017 Dec', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.01332', 'ORCID:']
