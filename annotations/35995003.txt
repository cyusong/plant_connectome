Salt stress-induced ethylene (ET) can influence the defence responses of plants that can be dependent on plant organs. In this work, the effects of salt stress evoked by 75 mM NaCl treatment were measured in fruits of wild-type (WT) and ET receptor-mutant Never ripe (Nr) tomato. Salt stress reduced the weight and size of fruits both in WT and Nr, which proved to be more pronounced in mutants. In addition, significantly higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels and lipid peroxidation were measured after the salt treatment in Nr as compared to the untreated control than in WT. ET regulated the key antioxidant enzymes, especially ascorbate peroxidase (APX), in WT but in the mutant fruits the activity of APX did not change and the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were downregulated compared to untreated controls after salt treatment contributing to a higher degree of oxidative stress in Nr fruits. The dependency of PA metabolism on the active ET signalling was investigated for the first time in fruits of Nr mutants under salt stress. 75 mM NaCl enhanced the accumulation of spermine in WT fruits, which was not observed in Nr, but levels of putrescine and spermidine were elevated by salt stress in these tissues. Moreover, the catabolism of PAs was much stronger under high salinity in Nr fruits contributing to higher oxidative stress, which was only partially alleviated by the increased total and reduced ascorbate and glutathione pool. We can conclude that ET-mediated signalling plays a crucial role in the regulation of salt-induced oxidative stress and PA levels in tomato fruits at the mature stage.
