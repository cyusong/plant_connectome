['28752516', 'CYCLING DOF FACTOR 1 (CDF1) and its homologs play an important role in the floral  transition by repressing the expression of floral activator genes such as  CONSTANS (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis. The day-length-specific  removal of CDF1-dependent repression is a critical mechanism in photoperiodic  flowering. However, the mechanism by which CDF1 represses CO and FT transcription  remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that Arabidopsis CDF proteins contain  non-EAR motif-like conserved domains required for interaction with the TOPLESS  (TPL) co-repressor protein. This TPL interaction confers a repressive function on  CDF1, as mutations of the N-terminal TPL binding domain largely impair the  ability of CDF1 protein to repress its targets. TPL proteins are present on  specific regions of the CO and FT promoters where CDF1 binds during the morning.  In addition, TPL binding increases when CDF1 expression is elevated, suggesting  that TPL is recruited to these promoters in a time-dependent fashion by CDFs.  Moreover, reduction of TPL activity induced by expressing a dominant negative  version of TPL (tpl-1) in phloem companion cells results in early flowering and a  decreased sensitivity to photoperiod in a manner similar to a cdf  loss-of-function mutant. Our results indicate that the mechanism of CDF1  repression is through the formation of a CDF-TPL transcriptional complex, which  reduces the expression levels of CO and FT during the morning for seasonal  flowering.', '2017 Oct', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.13649', 'Imaizumi']
