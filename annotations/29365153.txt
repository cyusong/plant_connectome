Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient; however, few genes required for growth under low-Mn conditions have been identified. In this study, we isolated Arabidopsis thaliana mutants sensitive to low-Mn conditions from ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized seeds. Among them, we identified the causal genes of two mutants. One mutant (35-34) exhibited a short root phenotype and low Mn concentration in the shoots. The other mutant (30-11) exhibited a small shoot phenotype with Mn concentrations similar to the control. Genetic mapping, allelism tests, and gene complementation tests identified the causal genes as At1g80830 (NRAMP1) for 35-34 and At5g18480 (PGSIP6) for 30-11. NRAMP1 was previously reported to be essential for Mn uptake under low-Mn conditions, thus validating our screening method. PGSIP6 encodes inositol phosphorylceramide glucuronosyltransferase, which is involved in glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramide sphingolipid glycosylation. PGSIP6-green fluorescent protein was localized to the Golgi apparatus, which is consistent with its function in the glycosylation of sphingolipids. Our screening identified a novel gene required for low-Mn tolerance, and we also provide new insights towards understanding the physiological function of PGSIP6.
