['26522839', 'Translational regulation, exerted by the cytosolic ribosome, has been shown to  participate in the establishment of abaxial-adaxial polarity in Arabidopsis  thaliana: many hypomorphic and null alleles of genes encoding proteins of the  cytosolic ribosome enhance the leaf polarity defects of asymmetric leaves1 (as1)  and as2 mutants. Here, we report the identification of the SCABRA1 (SCA1) nuclear  gene, whose loss-of-function mutations also enhance the polarity defects of the  as2 mutants. In striking contrast to other previously known enhancers of the  phenotypes caused by the as1 and as2 mutations, we found that SCA1 encodes a  plastid-type ribosomal protein that functions as a structural component of the  70S plastid ribosome and, therefore, its role in abaxial-adaxial patterning was  not expected.', '2015 Nov 2', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep15975', 'Micol']
