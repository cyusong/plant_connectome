Plants adapt to their ever-changing environment via positive and negative signals induced by environmental stimuli. Drought stress, for instance, induces accumulation of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), triggering ABA signal transduction. However, the molecular mechanisms for switching between plant growth promotion and stress response remain poorly understood. Here we report that RAF (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma)-LIKE MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE KINASE KINASE 22 (RAF22) in Arabidopsis thaliana physically interacts with ABA INSENSITIVE 1 (ABI1) and phosphorylates ABI1 at Ser416 residue to enhance its phosphatase activity. Interestingly, ABI1 can also enhance the activity of RAF22 through dephosphorylation, reciprocally inhibiting ABA signaling and promoting the maintenance of plant growth under normal conditions. Under drought stress, however, the ABA-activated OPEN STOMATA1 (OST1) phosphorylates the Ser81 residue of RAF22 and inhibits its kinase activity, restraining its enhancement of ABI1 activity. Taken together, our study reveals that RAF22, ABI1, and OST1 form a dynamic regulatory network that plays crucial roles in optimizing plant growth and environmental adaptation under drought stress.
