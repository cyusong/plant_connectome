['31638649', 'Plant growth is significantly altered in response to submergence stress. However,  the molecular mechanisms used by seedlings in response to this stress, especially  for hypocotyl growth, are largely unknown in terrestrial plants such as  Arabidopsis thaliana. The microtubule cytoskeleton participates in plant cell  growth, but it remains unclear whether submergence-mediated plant growth involves  the microtubule cytoskeleton. We demonstrated that in Arabidopsis submergence  induced underwater hypocotyl elongation through the activation of ethylene  signaling, which modulated cortical microtubule reorganization. Submergence  enhanced ethylene signaling, which then activated and stabilized its downstream  transcription factor, phytochrome-interacting factor 3 (PIF3), to promote  hypocotyl elongation. In particular, the regulation of microtubule organization  was important for this physiological process. Microtubule-destabilizing protein  60 (MDP60), which was previously identified as a downstream effector of PIF3,  played a positive role in submergence-induced hypocotyl elongation. Submergence  induced MDP60 expression through ethylene signaling. The effects of submergence  on hypocotyl elongation and cortical microtubule reorganization were suppressed  in mdp60 mutants. These data suggest a potential mechanism by which submergence  activates ethylene signaling to promote underwater hypocotyl elongation via  alteration of the microtubule cytoskeleton in Arabidopsis.', '2020 Jan 23', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erz453', 'Mao']
