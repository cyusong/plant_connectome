['26578169', 'PIN proteins are auxin export carriers that direct intercellular auxin flow and  in turn regulate many aspects of plant growth and development including responses  to environmental changes. The Arabidopsis R2R3-MYB transcription factor FOUR LIPS  (FLP) and its paralogue MYB88 regulate terminal divisions during stomatal  development, as well as female reproductive development and stress responses.  Here we show that FLP and MYB88 act redundantly but differentially in regulating  the transcription of PIN3 and PIN7 in gravity-sensing cells of primary and  lateral roots. On the one hand, FLP is involved in responses to gravity  stimulation in primary roots, whereas on the other, FLP and MYB88 function  complementarily in establishing the gravitropic set-point angles of lateral  roots. Our results support a model in which FLP and MYB88 expression specifically  determines the temporal-spatial patterns of PIN3 and PIN7 transcription that are  closely associated with their preferential functions during root responses to  gravity.', '2015 Nov 18', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms9822', 'Le']
