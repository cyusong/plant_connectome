<i>Liriope spicata</i> is an evergreen perennial ornamental groundcover with a strong freezing tolerance. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the freezing tolerance in <i>L. spicata</i> remains unclear. In this study, a comprehensive investigation of <i>L. spicata</i> freezing tolerance was conducted at the levels of physiology and biochemistry, metabolite, and transcript during the stress treatment. There were 581 unique differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) and 10,444 unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between freezing treatment and normal cultured plant in leaves. Integrated analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics showed that flavonoid biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and signal transduction pathways were prominently enriched in response to the freezing stress in <i>L</i>. <i>spicata</i>. Now, we identified genes and metabolites involved in the flavonoid pathway, abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, and the oxidative synthesis pathway of nitric oxide (NO), which may form a regulatory network and play a synergistic effect in osmotic adjustment, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, and stomatal closure under freezing stress. These results offer a comprehensive network of flavonoids, ABA, and NO comodulating the freezing tolerance in <i>L. spicata</i>.
