['26031782', 'Despite the fact that a variety of nuclear-encoded RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)  are targeted to the chloroplast and play essential roles during  post-transcriptional RNA metabolism in the chloroplast, the physiological roles  of the majority of chloroplast-targeted RBPs remain elusive. Here, we  investigated the functional role of a nuclear-encoded S1 domain-containing RBP,  designated SDP, in the growth and development of Arabidopsis thaliana. Confocal  analysis of the SDP-green fluorescent protein revealed that SDP was localized to  the chloroplast. The loss-of-function sdp mutant displayed retarded seed  germination and pale-green phenotypes, and grew smaller than the wild-type  plants. Chlorophyll a content and photosynthetic activity of the sdp mutant were  much lower than those of wild-type plants, and the structures of the chloroplast  and the prolamellar body were abnormal in the sdp mutant. The processing of rRNAs  in the chloroplast was defective in the sdp mutant, and SDP was able to bind  chloroplast 23S, 16S, 5S and 4.5S rRNAs. Notably, SDP possesses RNA chaperone  activity. Transcript levels of the nuclear genes involved in chlorophyll  biosynthesis were altered in the sdp mutant. Collectively, these results suggest  that chloroplast-targeted SDP harboring RNA chaperone activity affects rRNA  processing, chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthetic activity, which is crucial  for normal growth of Arabidopsis.', '2015 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/tpj.12889', 'Kang']
