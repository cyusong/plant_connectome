The phenotypic variation of vegetative organs and reproductive organs of newly synthesized and natural <i>Arabidopsis kamchatica</i> genotypes was investigated in both a controlled environment and a natural environment in an experimental garden. When we compared the variation of their leaf shape as a vegetative organ, the synthetic <i>A. kamchatica</i> individuals grown in the garden showed larger variation compared with the individuals incubated in a growth chamber, suggesting enhanced phenotypic variation in a natural fluctuating environment. In contrast, the natural <i>A. kamchatica</i> genotypes did not show significant change in variation by growth condition. The phenotypic variation of floral organs by growth condition was much smaller in both synthetic and natural <i>A. kamchatica</i> genotypes, and the difference in variation width between the growth chamber and the garden was not significant in each genotype as well as among genotypes. The higher phenotypic variation in synthetic leaf may imply flexible transcriptomic regulation of a newly synthesized polyploid compared with a natural polyploid.
