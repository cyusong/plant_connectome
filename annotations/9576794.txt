['9576794', "A cDNA encoding the Arabidopsis thaliana uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP)/cytidine  5'-monophosphate (CMP) kinase was isolated by complementation of a Saccharomyces  cerevisiae ura6 mutant. The deduced amino acid sequence of the plant UMP/CMP  kinase has 50% identity with other eukaryotic UMP/CMP kinase proteins. The cDNA  was subcloned into pGEX-4T-3 and expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion  protein in Escherichia coli. Following proteolytic digestion, the plant UMP/CMP  kinase was purified and analyzed for its structural and kinetic properties. The  mass, N-terminal sequence, and total amino acid composition agreed with the  sequence and composition predicted from the cDNA sequence. Kinetic analysis  revealed that the UMP/CMP kinase preferentially uses ATP (Michaelis constant [Km]  = 29 microM when UMP is the other substrate and Km = 292 microM when CMP is the  other substrate) as a phosphate donor. However, both UMP (Km = 153 microM) and  CMP (Km = 266 microM) were equally acceptable as the phosphate acceptor. The  optimal pH for the enzyme is 6.5. P1, P5-di(adenosine-5') pentaphosphate was  found to be a competitive inhibitor of both ATP and UMP.", '1998 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.117.1.245', 'Thornburg']
