['9363754', 'Squalene synthase (SQS) catalyzes the first committed step of the sterol  biosynthetic pathway. A full-length Arabidopsis thaliana SQS cDNA has been  isolated by combining library screening and PCR-based approaches. Arabidopsis SQS  is encoded by a small gene family of two genes (SQS1 and SQS2) which are  organized in a tandem array. SQS1 and SQS2 have an identical organization with  regard to intron positions and exon sizes and encode SQS isoforms showing a high  level of sequence conservation (79% identity and 88% similarity). The isolated  cDNA has been assigned to the SQS1 gene product, SQS1. RNA blot analysis has  shown that the 1.6-kb SQS1 mRNA is detected in all plant tissues analyzed  (inflorescenses, leaves, stems and roots) although the transcript is especially  abundant in roots. Arabidopsis SQS1 isoform is unable to complement the  SQS-defective Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 5302, although SQS activity was  detected in the microsomal fraction of the transformed yeast strain. However, a  chimeric SQS resulting from the replacement of the 66 C-terminal residues of the  Arabidopsis enzyme by the 111 C-terminal residues of the Schizosaccharomyces  pombe enzyme was able to confer ergosterol prototrophy to strain 5302. Labeling  studies using [3H]farnesyl-P2 and microsomal fractions obtained from yeast  strains expressing either Arabidopsis SQS1 or chimeric Arabidopsis/S. pombe SQS  derivatives indicated that the C-terminal region of the enzyme is involved in the  channeling of squalene through the yeast sterol pathway.', '1997 Oct 1', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00061.x', 'Boronat']
