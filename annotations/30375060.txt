Alternative splicing (AS) plays key roles in plant development and the responses of plants to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms underlying AS divergence (differential expression of transcript isoforms resulting from AS) in plant accessions and its contribution to responses to environmental stimuli remain unclear. In this study, we investigated genome-wide variation of AS in Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col-0, Bur-0, C24, Kro-0 and Ler-1, as well as their F<sub>1</sub> hybrids, and characterized the regulatory mechanisms for AS divergence by RNA sequencing. We found that most of the divergent AS events in Arabidopsis accessions were cis-regulated by sequence variation, including those in core splice site and splicing motifs. Many genes that differed in AS between Col-0 and Bur-0 were involved in stimulus responses. Further genome-wide association analyses of 22 environmental variables showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms influencing known splice site strength were also associated with environmental stress responses. These results demonstrate that cis-variation in genomic sequences among Arabidopsis accessions was the dominant contributor to AS divergence, and it may contribute to differences in environmental responses among Arabidopsis accessions.
