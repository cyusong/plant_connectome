['19413687', '* Reductive catabolism of pyrimidine nucleotides occurs via a three-step pathway  in which uracil is degraded to beta-alanine, CO(2) and NH(3) through sequential  activities of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.2, PYD1),  dihydropyrimidinase (EC 3.5.2.2, PYD2) and beta-ureidopropionase (EC 3.5.1.6,  PYD3). * A proposed function of this pathway, in addition to the maintenance of  pyrimidine homeostasis, is the recycling of pyrimidine nitrogen to general  nitrogen metabolism. PYD expression and catabolism of [2-(14)C]-uracil are  markedly elevated in response to nitrogen limitation in plants, which can utilize  uracil as a nitrogen source. * PYD1, PYD2 and PYD3 knockout mutants were used for  functional analysis of this pathway in Arabidopsis. pyd mutants exhibited no  obvious phenotype under optimal growing conditions. pyd2 and pyd3 mutants were  unable to catabolize [2-(14)C]-uracil or to grow on uracil as the sole nitrogen  source. By contrast, catabolism of uracil was reduced by only 40% in pyd1  mutants, and pyd1 seedlings grew nearly as well as wild-type seedlings with a  uracil nitrogen source. These results confirm PYD1 function and suggest the  possible existence of another, as yet unknown, activity for uracil degradation to  dihydrouracil in this plant. * The localization of PYD-green fluorescent protein  fusions in the plastid (PYD1), secretory system (PYD2) and cytosol (PYD3)  suggests potentially complex metabolic regulation.', '2009', 'New Phytol', '10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02843.x', 'Slocum']
