The soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) seed coat has distinctive, genetically programmed patterns of pigmentation, and the recessive <i>k1</i> mutation can epistatically overcome the dominant <i>I</i> and <i>i<sup>i</sup></i> alleles, which inhibit seed color by producing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting <i>chalcone synthase</i> (<i>CHS</i>) mRNAs. Small RNA sequencing of dissected regions of immature seed coats demonstrated that <i>CHS</i> siRNA levels cause the patterns produced by the <i>i<sup>i</sup></i> and <i>i<sup>k</sup></i> alleles of the <i>I</i> locus, which restrict pigment to the hilum or saddle region of the seed coat, respectively. To identify the <i>K1</i> locus, we compared RNA-seq data from dissected regions of two Clark isolines having similar saddle phenotypes mediated by <i>CHS</i> siRNAs but different genotypes (homozygous <i>i<sup>k</sup> K1</i> versus homozygous <i>i<sup>i</sup> k1</i>). By examining differentially expressed genes, mapping information, and genome resequencing, we identified a 129-bp deletion in Glyma.11G190900 encoding Argonaute5 (AGO5), a member of the Argonaute family. Amplicon sequencing of several independent saddle pattern mutants from different genetic backgrounds revealed independent lesions affecting <i>AGO5</i>, thus establishing Glyma.11G190900 as the <i>K1</i> locus. Nonfunctional AGO5 from <i>k1</i> alleles leads to altered distributions of <i>CHS</i> siRNAs, thus explaining how the <i>k1</i> mutation reverses the phenotype of the seed coat regions from yellow to pigmented, even in the presence of the normally dominant <i>I</i> or <i>i<sup>i</sup></i> alleles.
