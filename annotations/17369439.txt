['17369439', 'Chain elongated, methionine (Met)-derived glucosinolates are a major class of  secondary metabolites in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The key enzymatic  step in determining the length of the chain is the condensation of  acetyl-coenzyme A with a series of omega-methylthio-2-oxoalkanoic acids,  catalyzed by methylthioalkylmalate (MAM) synthases. The existence of two MAM  synthases has been previously reported in the Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia: MAM1  and MAM3 (formerly known as MAM-L). Here, we describe the biochemical properties  of the MAM3 enzyme, which is able to catalyze all six condensation reactions of  Met chain elongation that occur in Arabidopsis. Underlining its broad substrate  specificity, MAM3 also accepts a range of non-Met-derived 2-oxoacids, e.g.  converting pyruvate to citramalate and 2-oxoisovalerate to isopropylmalate, a  step in leucine biosynthesis. To investigate its role in vivo, we identified  plant lines with mutations in MAM3 that resulted in a complete lack or greatly  reduced levels of long-chain glucosinolates. This phenotype could be complemented  by reintroduction of a MAM3 expression construct. Analysis of MAM3 mutants  demonstrated that MAM3 catalyzes the formation of all glucosinolate chain lengths  in vivo as well as in vitro, making this enzyme the major generator of  glucosinolate chain length diversity in the plant. The localization of MAM3 in  the chloroplast suggests that this organelle is the site of Met chain elongation.', '2007 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.106.091579', 'Tokuhisa']
