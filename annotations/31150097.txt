Amborella trichopoda is placed close to the base of the angiosperm lineage (basal angiosperm). By genome-wide RNA sequencing, we identified 184C-to-U RNA editing sites in the plastid genome of Amborella. This number is much higher than that observed in other angiosperms including maize (44 sites), rice (39 sites) and grape (115 sites). Despite the high frequency of RNA editing, the biased distribution of RNA editing sites in the genome, target codon preference and nucleotide preference adjacent to the edited cytidine are similar to that in other angiosperms, suggesting a common editing machinery. Consistent with this idea, the Amborella nuclear genome encodes 2-3 times more of the E- and DYW-subclass members of pentatricopeptide repeat proteins responsible for RNA editing site recognition in plant organelles. Among 165 editing sites in plastid protein coding sequences in Amborella, 100 sites were conserved at least in one out of 38 species selected to represent key branching points of the angiosperm phylogenetic tree. We assume these 100 sites represent at least a subset of the sites in the plastid editotype of ancestral angiosperms. We then mapped the loss and gain of editing sites on the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Our results support the idea that the evolution of angiosperms has led to the loss of RNA editing sites in plastids.
