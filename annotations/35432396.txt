It is known that the impact of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>) will cause differential photosynthetic responses in plants, resulting in varying magnitudes of growth and productivity of competing species. Because of the aggressive invasive nature of <i>Acacia longifolia</i> ssp. <i>longifolia</i>, this study is designed to investigate the effect of eCO<sub>2</sub> on gas exchange parameters, water use efficiency, photosystem II (PSII) activities, and growth of this species. Plants of <i>A. longifolia</i> ssp. <i>longifolia</i> were grown at 400 ppm (ambient) and 700 ppm (elevated) CO<sub>2</sub> under 100 and 60% field capacity. Leaf gas exchange parameters, water use efficiency, intrinsic water use efficiency, instantaneous carboxylation efficiency, and PSII activity were measured for 10 days at 2-day intervals. eCO<sub>2</sub> mitigated the adverse effects of drought conditions on the aforementioned parameters compared to that grown under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (aCO<sub>2</sub>) conditions. <i>A. longifolia</i>, grown under drought conditions and re-watered at day 8, indicated a partial recovery in most of the parameters measured, suggesting that the recovery of this species under eCO<sub>2</sub> will be higher than that with aCO<sub>2</sub> concentration. This gave an increase in water use efficiency, which is one of the reasons for the observed enhanced growth of <i>A. longifolia</i> under drought stress. Thus, eCO<sub>2</sub> will allow to adopt this species in the new environment, even under severe climatic conditions, and foreshadow its likelihood of invasion into new areas.
