The availability of CO2 is one of the restrictions on aquatic photosynthesis. Solute carrier (SLC) 4-2, a plasma membrane HCO3- transporter has previously been identified in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. In this study, we discovered two paralogs, PtSLC4-1 and PtSLC4-4, that are both localized at the plasma membrane. Their overexpression stimulated HCO3- uptake, and this was inhibited by the anion channel blocker 4,4´-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2´-disulfonic (DIDS). Similarly to SLC4-2, PtSLC4-1 specifically required Na+ of ~100 mM for its maximum HCO3- transport activity. Unlike PtSLC4-1 and PtSLC4-2, the HCO3- transport of PtSLC4-4 depended equally on Na+, K+, or Li+, suggesting its broad selectivity for cations. Transcript analyses indicated that PtSLC4-1 was the most abundant HCO3- transporter under CO2 concentrations below atmospheric levels, while PtSLC4-4 showed little transcript induction under atmospheric CO2 but transient induction to comparable levels to PtSLC4-1 during the initial acclimation stage from high CO2 (1%) to very low CO2 (<0.002%). Our results strongly suggest a major HCO3- transport role of PtSLC4-1 with a relatively minor role of PtSLC4-2, and that PtSLC4-4 operates under severe CO2 limitation unselectively to cations when the other SLC4s do not function to support HCO3- uptake.
