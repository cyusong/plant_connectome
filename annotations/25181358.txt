['25181358', "Post-transcriptional maturation of plant mitochondrial transcripts requires  several steps. Among these, the generation of mature 5' ends is still one of the  most enigmatic processes. Toward a characterization of proteins involved in 5'  processing of mitochondrial transcripts in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), we  now analyzed 5' maturation of nad2 transcripts. Based on natural genetic  variation affecting 5' ends of nad2 transcripts in ecotype Can-0 and  complementation studies we now identified RNA processing factor 7, which takes  part in the generation of the 5' terminus of the mature nad2 mRNA. RPF7 is a  relatively short regular P-class pentatricopeptide repeat protein comprising  seven canonical P repeats and a single short S repeat. The corresponding allele  in Can-0 encodes a truncated version of this protein lacking two C-terminal  repeats, which are essential for the function of RPF7. Furthermore we established  transgenic plants expressing artifical microRNAs targeting the mitochondrial  polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), which results in substantial reduction of  the PNPase mRNA levels and strong knockdown of this gene. Detailed quantitative  studies of 5' and 3' extended nad2 precursor RNAs in these knockdown plants as  well as in the rpf7-1 knockout mutant suggest that 5' processing contributes to  the stability of mitochondrial transcripts in plants.", '2014', 'RNA Biol', '10.4161/rna.29781', 'Binder']
