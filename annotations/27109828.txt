['27109828', 'The plant hormone auxin is perceived by the nuclear F-box protein TIR1 receptor  family and regulates gene expression through degradation of Aux/IAA  transcriptional repressors. Several studies have revealed the importance of the  proteasome in auxin signalling, but details on how the proteolytic machinery is  regulated and how this relates to degradation of Aux/IAA proteins remains  unclear. Here we show that an Arabidopsis homologue of the proteasome inhibitor  PI31, which we name PROTEASOME REGULATOR1 (PTRE1), is a positive regulator of the  26S proteasome. Loss-of-function ptre1 mutants are insensitive to auxin-mediated  suppression of proteasome activity, show diminished auxin-induced degradation of  Aux/IAA proteins and display auxin-related phenotypes. We found that auxin alters  the subcellular localization of PTRE1, suggesting this may be part of the  mechanism by which it reduces proteasome activity. Based on these results, we  propose that auxin regulates proteasome activity via PTRE1 to fine-tune the  homoeostasis of Aux/IAA repressor proteins thus modifying auxin activity.', '2016 Apr 25', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms11388', 'Xue']
