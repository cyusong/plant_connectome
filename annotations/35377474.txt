Drought is intensifying globally with climate change, creating an urgency to understand ecosystem response to drought both during and after these events end to limit loss of ecosystem functioning. The literature is replete with studies of how ecosystems respond during drought, yet there are far fewer studies focused on ecosystem dynamics after drought ends. Furthermore, while the terms used to describe drought can be variable and inconsistent, so can those that describe ecosystem responses following drought. With this review, we sought to evaluate and create clear definitions of the terms that ecologists use to describe post-drought responses. We found that legacy effects, resilience and recovery were used most commonly with respect to post-drought ecosystem responses, but the definitions used to describe these terms were variable. Based on our review of the literature, we propose a framework for generalizing ecosystem responses after drought ends, which we refer to as 'the post-drought period'. We suggest that future papers need to clearly describe characteristics of the imposed drought, and we encourage authors to use the term post-drought period as a general term that encompasses responses after drought ends and use other terms as more specific descriptors of responses during the post-drought period.
