Prolonged drought stress caused by global warming poses a tremendous challenge to silage production of maize. Drought during maize growth and development resulted in altered micro-environment for silage fermentation. How fermentation of silage maize responds to moisture scales remains uncharted territory. In this research, Maize water control trials were conducted and the silage quality and microbial community of drought-affected maize were determined. The results showed that drought stress significantly reduced the dry matter but increased root-to-shoot ratio, soluble sugar and malonaldehyde content in maize. Before fermentation, the crude protein, crude ash and acid detergent fiber contents were significantly increased but the ether extract content was decreased under drought. The crude protein and acid detergent fiber were significantly decreased in the drought affected group after fermentation. Furthermore, water stress at maize maturity stage greatly reduced the number of total bacteria in silage fermentation but increased the proportion of the lactobacillus and lactic acid content of silage. Drought stress alters the microbial ecosystem of the fermentation process and reconstitutes the diversity of the bacterial community and its metabolites. This study provides a theoretical basis for the study of changes in silage fermentation as affected by abiotic stresses.
