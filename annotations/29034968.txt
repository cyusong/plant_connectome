Cotton, with cellulose-enriched mature fibers, is the largest source of natural textiles. Through a map-based cloning strategy, we isolated an industrially important lint fiber development gene (Li<sub>3</sub> ) that encodes an MYB-MIXTA-like transcription factor (MML) on chromosome D12 (GhMML4_D12). Virus-induced gene silencing or decreasing the expression of the GhMML4_D12 gene in n<sub>2</sub> NSM plants resulted in a significant reduction in epidermal cell prominence and lint fiber production. GhMML4_D12 is arranged in tandem with GhMML3, another MIXTA gene responsible for fuzz fiber development. These two very closely related MIXTA genes direct fiber initiation production in two specialized cell forms: lint and fuzz fibers. They may control the same metabolic pathways in different cell types. The MIXTAs expanded in Malvaceae during their evolution and produced a Malvaceae-specific family that regulates epidermal cell differentiation, different from the gene family that regulates leaf hair trichome development. Cotton has developed a unique transcriptional regulatory network for fiber development. Characterization of target genes regulating fiber production has provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cotton fiber development and has allowed the use of genetic engineering to increase lint yield by inducing more epidermal cells to develop into lint rather than fuzz fibers.
