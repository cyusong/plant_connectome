['22398639', 'Acylamino acid-releasing enzyme/oxidized protein hydrolase (AARE/OPH) has been  biochemically demonstrated to be a bifunctional protease that has exopeptidase  activity against Nalpha-acylated peptides and endopeptidase activity against oxidized  and glycated proteins; however, its physiological role remains unknown. In this  study, to determine its physiological significance, we produced  AARE/OPH-overexpressing and -suppressed plants and assessed the biological  impacts of AARE/OPH. The subcellular localization of Arabidopsis AARE/OPH was  found to be cytoplasmic and nuclear by transient expression analysis of  tdTomato-fused Arabidopsis AARE/OPH. Overexpression of AARE/OPH exhibited no  apparent effect on the level of oxidized proteins because wild types probably  have inherently high AARE/OPH activity. Through RNAi gene suppressing, we  successfully produced AARE/OPH-suppressed Arabidopsis plants (aare) that  exhibited almost no AARE activity. In the aare plant, electrolyte leakage by  methyl viologen treatment was enhanced compared to that of non-transformant  plants, suggesting that the plasma membranes of aare easily suffered oxidative  damage, probably as a result of deterioration of the cytoplasmic antioxidative  system. Correspondingly, proteomic analysis revealed that the aare plant  accumulated a number of oxidized proteins including cytoplasmic antioxidant  enzymes. On the basis of these results, we concluded that AARE/OPH plays a  homeostatic role in sustaining the cytoplasmic antioxidative system.', '2012 Aug', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-012-1614-1', 'Tanaka']
