The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the cytoskeleton are functionally linked in living cells. Past research has focused on how the cytoskeleton regulates ER dynamics. How the ER may contribute to cytoskeletal dynamics has been overlooked. In this commentary, I examined how the ER mediates actin and microtubule dynamics in plant cells.

ER: !regulates! Actin
ER: !regulates! Microtubule
Cytoskeleton: !regulates! ER
