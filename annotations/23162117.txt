MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a novel mechanism of gene regulation affecting plant development, growth, and stress response. To study the role of miRNAs in arsenic (As) stress, microarray profiling of miRNAs was performed in Brassica juncea using a custom Phalanx Plant OneArray containing 381 unique miRNA probes representing 618 miRNAs from 22 plant species. miRNA microarray hybridization of roots exposed to As for 1h and 4h revealed that a total of 69 miRNAs belonging to 18 plant miRNA families had significantly altered expression. The As-responsive miRNAs also exhibited a time- and organ-dependent change in their expression. Putative target prediction for the miRNAs suggested that they regulate various developmental processes (e.g. miR156, miR169, and miR172), sulphur uptake, transport, and assimilation (miR395, miR838, and miR854), and hormonal biosynthesis and/or function (e.g. miR319, miR167, miR164, and miR159). Notable changes were observed in the level of auxins [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3- butyric acid, and naphthalene acetic acid], jasmonates [jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate], and abscisic acid. The exogenous supply of JA and IAA improved growth of plants under As stress and altered expression of miR167, miR319, and miR854, suggesting interplay of hormones and miRNAs in the regulation of As response. In conclusion, the present work demonstrates the role of miRNAs and associated mechanisms in the plant's response towards As stress.
