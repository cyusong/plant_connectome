Remodeling of auxin distribution during the integration of plant growth responses with the environment requires the precise control of auxin influx and efflux transporters. The plasma membrane-localized PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins facilitate auxin efflux from cells, and their activity is regulated by reversible phosphorylation. How PIN modulates plant cellular responses to external stresses and whether its activity is coordinated by phospholipids remain unclear. Here, we reveal that, in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the phosphatidic acid (PA)-regulated PINOID (PID) kinase is a crucial modulator of PIN2 activity and auxin redistribution in response to salt stress. Under salt stress, loss of phospholipase D function impaired auxin redistribution and resulted in markedly reduced primary root growth; these effects were reversed by exogenous PA. The phospholipase D-derived PA interacted with PID and increased PID-dependent phosphorylation of PIN2, which activated auxin efflux and altered auxin accumulation, promoting root growth when exposed to salt stress. Ablation of the PA binding motif not only diminished PID accumulation at the plasma membrane but also abolished PA-promoted PID phosphorylation of PIN2 and its function in coping with salt stress; however, this ablation did not affect inflorescence and cotyledon development or PIN2-dependent gravitropic and halotropic responses. Our data indicate a role for PA in coupling extracellular salt signaling to PID-directed PIN2 phosphorylation and polar auxin transport, highlighting the importance of lipid-protein interactions in the spatiotemporal regulation of auxin signaling.
