ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in combination with uni- and multivariate analysis was used to quantify the spectral-chemical composition of the leaf cuticle of pea, investigating the effects of variety and heat stress. Field pea (Pisum sativum L.) is sensitive to heat stress and our goal was to improve canopy cooling and flower retention by investigating the protective role of lipid-related compounds in leaf cuticle, and to use results in the future to identify heat resistant genotypes. The objective was to use Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR)-Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, a non-invasive technique, to investigate and quantify changes in adaxial cuticles of fresh leaves of pea varieties that were subjected to heat stress. Eleven varieties were grown under control (24/18 °C day/night) and heat stress conditions (35/18 °C day/night, for 5 days at the early flowering stage). These 11 had significant spectral differences in the integrated area of the main lipid region, CH<sub>2</sub> region, CH<sub>3</sub> peak, asymmetric and symmetric CH<sub>2</sub> peaks, ester carbonyl peak, and the peak area ratio of CH<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>3</sub> and ester carbonyl to CH<sub>2</sub> asymmetric peak, indicating that cuticles had spectral-chemical diversity of waxes, cutin, and polysaccharides. Results indicated considerable diversity in spectral-chemical makeup of leaf cuticles within commercially available field pea varieties and they responded differently to high growth temperature, revealing their diverse potential to resist heat stress. The ATR-FTIR spectral technique can, therefore, be further used as a medium-throughput approach for rapid screening of superior cultivars for heat tolerance.
