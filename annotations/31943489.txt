Rapidly communicating the perception of an abiotic stress event, wounding or pathogen infection, from its initial site of occurrence to the entire plant, i.e. rapid systemic signaling, is essential for successful plant acclimation and defense. Recent studies highlighted an important role for several rapid whole-plant systemic signals in mediating plant acclimation and defense during different abiotic and biotic stresses. These include calcium, reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydraulic and electric waves. Although the role of some of these signals in inducing and coordinating whole-plant systemic responses was demonstrated, many questions related to their mode of action, routes of propagation and integration remain unanswered. In addition, it is unclear how these signals convey specificity to the systemic response, and how are they integrated under conditions of stress combination. Here we highlight many of these questions, as well as provide a proposed model for systemic signal integration, focusing on the ROS wave.

ROS: !mediates! Plant Acclimation and Defense 
Calcium: !induces and coordinates! Whole-Plant Systemic Responses 
Hydraulic Waves: !propagate! Systemic Signals 
Electric Waves: !integrate! Systemic Signals 
ROS Wave: !conveys specificity! Systemic Response
