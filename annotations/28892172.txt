The ultraviolet-B (UV-B) photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) mediates photomorphogenic responses to UV-B in Arabidopsis through differential gene expression, but little is known about UVR8 in other species. Bryophyte lineages were the earliest diverging embryophytes, thus being the first plants facing the UV-B regime typical of land. We therefore examined whether liverwort and moss species have functional UVR8 proteins and whether they are regulated similarly to Arabidopsis UVR8. We examined the expression, dimer/monomer status, cellular localisation and function of Marchantia polymorpha and Physcomitrella patens UVR8 in experiments with bryophyte tissue and expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-UVR8 fusions in Nicotiana leaves and transgenic Arabidopsis. P. patens expresses two UVR8 genes that encode functional proteins, whereas the single M. polymorpha UVR8 gene expresses two transcripts by alternative splicing that encode functional UVR8 variants. P. patens UVR8 proteins form dimers that monomerise and accumulate in the nucleus following UV-B exposure, similar to Arabidopsis UVR8, but M. polymorpha UVR8 has weaker dimers and the proteins appear more constitutively nuclear. We conclude that liverwort and moss species produce functional UVR8 proteins. Although there are differences in expression and regulation of P. patens and M. polymorpha UVR8, the mechanism of UVR8 action is strongly conserved in evolution.
