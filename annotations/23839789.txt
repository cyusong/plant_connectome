B chromosomes (Bs) are dispensable components of the genomes of numerous species. In contrast with the prevalent view that Bs do not harbor genes, our recent sequence analysis revealed that Bs of rye (Secale cereale) are rich in gene-derived sequences. We compared these gene-like fragments of the rye B with their ancestral A-located counterparts and confirmed an A chromosomal origin and the pseudogenization of B-located gene-like fragments. About 15% of the pseudogene-like fragments on Bs are transcribed in a tissue-type and genotype-specific manner. In addition, B-located sequences can cause in trans down- or upregulation of A chromosome-encoded genic fragments. Phenotypes and effects associated with the presence of Bs might be explained by the activity of B-located pseudogenes. We propose a model for the evolution of B-located pseudogenes.

B chromosome: !harbors! gene-derived sequences
B chromosome: !transcribes! pseudogene-like fragments
pseudogene-like fragments: !downregulates! A chromosome-encoded genic fragments
pseudogene-like fragments: !upregulates! A chromosome-encoded genic fragments
