To identify molecular mechanisms controlling vein patterns, we analyzed scarface (sfc) mutants. sfc cotyledon and leaf veins are largely fragmented, unlike the interconnected networks in wild-type plants. SFC encodes an ADP ribosylation factor GTPase activating protein (ARF-GAP), a class with well-established roles in vesicle trafficking regulation. Quadruple mutants of SCF and three homologs (ARF-GAP DOMAIN1, 2, and 4) showed a modestly enhanced vascular phenotype. Genetic interactions between sfc and pinoid and between sfc and gnom suggest a possible function for SFC in trafficking of auxin efflux regulators. Genetic analyses also revealed interaction with cotyledon vascular pattern2, suggesting that lipid-based signals may underlie some SFC ARF-GAP functions. To assess possible roles for SFC in auxin transport, we analyzed sfc roots, which showed exaggerated responses to exogenous auxin and higher auxin transport capacity. To determine whether PIN1 intracellular trafficking was affected, we analyzed PIN1:green fluorescent protein (GFP) dynamics using confocal microscopy in sfc roots. We found normal PIN1:GFP localization at the apical membrane of root cells, but treatment with brefeldin A resulted in PIN1 accumulating in smaller and more numerous compartments than in the wild type. These data suggest that SFC is required for normal intracellular transport of PIN1 from the plasma membrane to the endosome.
