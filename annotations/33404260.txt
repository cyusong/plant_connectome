<i>Clonostachys rosea</i> strains ACM941 and 88-710 are beneficial microbes recognized for their plant disease control and growth promotion properties, respectively, when applied to economically important crops. In addition to their geographical and functional overlap, the two strains also share a high degree of genetic similarity. In an effort to identify the subtleties that underlie their strain-specific applications, their genomic sequence is reported here. The genome size of ACM941 was estimated to be 56.9 Mb, encoding 17,585 putative genes, while strain 88-710 was estimated to have a 55.5 Mb genome size, containing 17,188 predicted genes. Overall, ACM941 and 88-710 share >96% of their encoded genomes, such that their strain-specific characteristics are likely encoded in either the remaining variable 4% or differentially regulated shared genes or both. These genomic sequences form a foundation for future studies aimed at identifying the genomic and metabolic machinery driving their respective beneficial properties.
