The molecular mechanism underlying sexual reproduction in land plants is well understood in model plants and is a target for crop improvement. However, unlike land plants, the genetic basis involved in triggering reproduction and gamete formation remains elusive in most seaweeds, which are increasingly viewed as an alternative source of functional food and feedstock for energy applications. Gametogenesis of Ulva mutabilis, a model organism for green seaweeds, was studied. We analyzed transcriptome dynamics at different time points during gametogenesis following induction of reproduction by fragmentation and removal of sporulation inhibitors. Analyses demonstrated that 45% of the genes in the genome were differentially expressed during gametogenesis. We identified several transcription factors that potentially play a key role in the early gametogenesis of Ulva given the function of their homologs in higher plants and microalgae. In particular, the detailed expression pattern of an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor containing an RWP-RK domain suggested a key role during Ulva gametogenesis. Transcriptomic analyses of gametogenesis in the green seaweed Ulva highlight the importance of a conserved RWP-RK transcription factor in the induction of sexual reproduction. The identification of putative master regulators of gametogenesis provides a starting point for further functional characterization.
