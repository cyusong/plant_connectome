In Arabidopsis thaliana, vernalization promotes flowering by repressing the floral inhibitor FLOWERING LOCUS C (AtFLC). This repression is mediated through epigenetic modifications at the AtFLC locus, leading to gene silencing. Whether the well-known quantitative effect of vernalization is due to the degree of AtFLC repression and/or its stability after return to normal temperature conditions has not been clarified. Here, we examine this question in white mustard, Sinapis alba, taking advantage of our recent cloning of the AtFLC ortholog SaFLC.

Vernalization: !represses! FLOWERING LOCUS C
Epigenetic modifications: !mediate! AtFLC repression
AtFLC: !localizes to! locus
SaFLC: !cloned! in white mustard
