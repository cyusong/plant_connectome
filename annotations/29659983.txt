Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations are leading to increases in dissolved CO2 and HCO3- concentrations and decreases in pH and CO32- in the world's oceans. There remain many uncertainties as to the magnitude of biological responses of key organisms to these chemical changes. In this study, we established the relationship between photosynthetic carbon fixation rates and pH, CO2, and HCO3- concentrations in the diazotroph, Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101. Inorganic 14C-assimilation was measured in TRIS-buffered artificial seawater medium where the absolute and relative concentrations of CO2, pH, and HCO3- were manipulated. First, we varied the total dissolved inorganic carbon concentration (TIC) (<0 to ~5 mM) at constant pH, so that ratios of CO2 and HCO3- remained relatively constant. Second, we varied pH (~8.54 to 7.52) at constant TIC, so that CO2 increased whilst HCO3- declined. We found that 14C-assimilation could be described by the same function of CO2 for both approaches, but it showed different dependencies on HCO3- when pH was varied at constant TIC than when TIC was varied at constant pH. A numerical model of the carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) of Trichodesmium showed that carboxylation rates are modulated by HCO3- and pH. The decrease in assimilation of inorganic carbon (Ci) at low CO2, when TIC was varied, was due to HCO3- uptake limitation of the carboxylation rate. Conversely, when pH was varied, Ci assimilation declined due to a high-pH mediated increase in HCO3- and CO2 leakage rates, potentially coupled to other processes (uncharacterised within the CCM model) that restrict Ci assimilation rates under high-pH conditions.
