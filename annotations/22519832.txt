['22519832', 'Directional cell-to-cell movement of auxin is mediated by asymmetrically  localized PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux transporters. The polar localization of  PINs has been reported to be modulated by phosphorylation. In this study, the  function of the phosphorylation sites of the PIN3 central hydrophilic loop (HL)  was characterized. The phosphorylation sites were located in two conserved  neighboring motifs, RKSNASRRSF(/L) and TPRPSNL, where the former played a more  decisive role than the latter. Mutations of these phosphorylatable residues  disrupted in planta phosphorylation of PIN3 and its subcellular trafficking, and  caused defects in PIN3-mediated biological processes such as auxin efflux  activity, auxin maxima formation, root growth, and root gravitropism. Because the  defective intracellular trafficking behaviors of phospho-mutated PIN3 varied  according to cell type, phosphorylation codes in PIN3-HL are likely to operate in  a cell-type-specific manner.', '2012 Sep', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.05030.x', 'Cho']
