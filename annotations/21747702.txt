Plants are frequently attacked by herbivores and pathogens and therefore have acquired constitutive and induced defenses during the course of their evolution. Here we review recent progress in the study of the early signal transduction pathways in host plants in response to herbivory. The sophisticated signaling network for plant defense responses is elicited and driven by both herbivore-induced factors (e.g., elicitors, effectors, and wounding) and plant signaling (e.g., phytohormone and plant volatiles) in response to arthropod factors. We describe significant findings, illuminating the scenario by providing broad insights into plant signaling involved in several arthropod-host interactions.

Herbivore-induced factors: !elicit! Plant signaling
Effectors: !elicit! Plant signaling
Wounding: !elicit! Plant signaling
Phytohormone: !drives! Plant defense responses
Plant volatiles: !drives! Plant defense responses
