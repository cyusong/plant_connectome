['12019243', 'Previous QTL mapping identified a Brassica nigra homolog to Arabidopsis thaliana  CO as a candidate gene affecting flowering time in B. nigra. Transformation of an  A. thaliana co mutant with two different alleles of the B. nigra CO (Bni COa)  homolog, one from an early-flowering B. nigra plant and one from a late one, did  not show any differential effect of the two alleles on flowering time. The DNA  sequence of the coding region of the two alleles was also identical, showing that  nucleotide variation influencing flowering time must reside outside the coding  region of Bni COa. In contrast, the nucleotide sequence of the B. nigra COL1 (Bni  COL1) gene located 3.5 kb upstream of Bni COa was highly diverged between the  alleles from early and late plants. One indel polymorphism in the Bni COL1 coding  region, present in several natural populations of B. nigra, displayed a  significant association with flowering time within a majority of these  populations. These data indicate that a quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN)  affecting flowering time is located within or close to the Bni COL1 gene. The  intergenic sequence between Bni COL1 and Bni COa displayed a prominent peak of  divergence 1 kb downstream of the Bni COL1 coding region. This region could  contain regulatory elements for the downstream Bni COa gene. Our data suggest  that a naturally occurring QTN for flowering time affects the function or  expression of either Bni COL1 or Bni COa.', '2002 May', 'Genetics', '10.1093/genetics/161.1.299', 'Lagercrantz']
