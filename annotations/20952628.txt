Since the discovery of miRNAs in plants it has become clear that they are central to the regulation of many aspects of plant development and responses to the environment. miR172 regulates expression of a small group of AP2-like transcription factors in an evolutionarily ancient interaction. miR172 functions in regulating the transitions between developmental stages and in specifying floral organ identity. These two roles are conserved across monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Investigations into the roles of miR172 and its targets in phase changes in the model plant Arabidopsis have illustrated that this process is governed by complex regulatory systems. In addition to its conserved roles, miR172 has also acquired specialized species-specific functions in other aspects of plant development such as cleistogamy and tuberization.
