Four R3 MYB genes were cloned and identified from Platanus acerifolia and analysed according to endogenous gene expression profiles, protein-protein interaction patterns, phenotypic effects and related gene expression profiles in transgenic Arabidopsis, suggesting that London plane R3 MYB genes inhibit trichome formation in Arabidopsis. The CPC-like MYB transcription factors including CAPRICE (CPC), TRIPTYCHON (TRY), ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC 1, 2 and 3 (ETC1, ETC2 and ETC3), TRICHOMELESS1 (TCL1) and TRICHOMELESS2(TCL2) play important roles in controlling trichome patterning in Arabidopsis. In this study, four sequences homologous with the Arabidopsis CPC family were identified from London plane and named PaTRY, PaCPC-like1, PaCPC-like2 and PaCPC-like3. Over-expression of PaTRY, PaCPC-like1, PaCPC-like2 and PaCPC-like3 in Arabidopsis resulted in glabrous phenotypes. In addition, expression of endogenous GL2, GL1, MYB23, TTG2 and a set of R3 MYB-encoding genes was markedly reduced. Furthermore, the protein products of PaTRY, PaCPC-like1, PaCPC-like2 and PaCPC-like3 were shown to interact with PaGL3 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Together, these results likely suggest that the mechanisms of trichome regulation in London plane have similarities with those in Arabidopsis.
