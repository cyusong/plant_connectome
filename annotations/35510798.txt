Concurrent measurement of multiple foliar traits to assess the full range of trade-offs among and within taxa and across broad environmental gradients is limited. Leaf spectroscopy can quantify a wide range of foliar functional traits, enabling assessment of interrelationships among traits and with the environment. We analyzed leaf trait measurements from 32 sites along the wide eco-climatic gradient encompassed by the US National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). We explored the relationships among 14 foliar traits of 1103 individuals across and within species, and with environmental factors. Across all species pooled, the relationships between leaf economic traits (leaf mass per area, nitrogen) and traits indicative of defense and stress tolerance (phenolics, nonstructural carbohydrates) were weak, but became strong within certain species. Elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation weakly predicted trait variation across species, although some traits exhibited species-specific significant relationships with environmental factors. Foliar functional traits vary idiosyncratically and species express diverse combinations of leaf traits to achieve fitness. Leaf spectroscopy offers an effective approach to quantify intra-species trait variation and covariation, and potentially could be used to improve the characterization of vegetation in Earth system models.
