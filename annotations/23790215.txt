Nonself fusion and nuclear genetic exchange have been documented in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), particularly in Rhizophagus irregularis. However, mitochondrial transmission accompanying nonself fusion of genetically divergent isolates remains unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy occurs in the progeny of spores, obtained by crossing genetically divergent mtDNAs in R. irregularis isolates. Three isolates of geographically distant locations were used to investigate nonself fusions and mtDNA transmission to the progeny. We sequenced two additional mtDNAs of two R. irregularis isolates and developed isolate-specific size-variable markers in intergenic regions of these isolates and those of DAOM-197198. We achieved three crossing combinations in pre-symbiotic and symbiotic phases. Progeny spores per crossing combination were genotyped using isolate-specific markers. We found evidence that nonself recognition occurs between isolates originating from different continents both in pre-symbiotic and symbiotic phases. Genotyping patterns of individual spores from the progeny clearly showed the presence of markers of the two parental mtDNA haplotypes. Our results demonstrate that mtDNA heteroplasmy occurs in the progeny of the crossed isolates. However, this heteroplasmy appears to be a transient stage because all the live progeny spores that were able to germinate showed only one mtDNA haplotype.
