<i>Asarum sieboldii</i> Miq. is a leading economic crop and a traditional medicinal herb in China. Leaf-blade and petiole are the only aerial tissues of <i>A. sieboldii</i> during the vegetative growth, playing a vital role in the accumulation and transportation of biomass energy. They also act as critical indicators of drought in agricultural management, especially for crops having underground stems. During drought, variations in the morphology and gene expression of the leaves and petioles are used to control agricultural irrigation and production. Besides, such stress can also alter the differential gene expression in these tissues. However, little is known about the drought-tolerant character of the aerial parts of <i>A. sieboldii</i>. In this study, we examined the physiological, biochemical and transcriptomic responses to the drought stress in the leaf blades and petioles of <i>A. sieboldii</i>. The molecular mechanism, involving in drought stress response, was elucidated by constructing the cDNA libraries and performing transcriptomic sequencing. Under drought stress, a total of 2912 and 2887 unigenes were differentially expressed in the leaf blade and petiole, respectively. The detection of many transcription factors and functional genes demonstrated that multiple regulatory pathways were involved in drought tolerance. In response to drought, the leaf blade and petiole displayed a general physiological character, a higher SOD and POD activity, a higher MDA content and lower chlorophyll content. Three unigenes encoding POD were up-regulated, which can improve POD activity. Essential oil in petiole was extracted. The relative contents of methyleugenol and safrole in essential oil were increased from 0.01% to 0.05%, and 3.89% to 16.97%, respectively, while myristicin slightly reduced from 24.87% to 21.52%. Additionally, an IGS unigene, involved in eugenol biobiosynthesis, was found up-regulated under drought stress, which was predicated to be responsible for the accumulation of methyleugenol and safrole. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were characterized in of <i>A. sieboldii</i>, and a total of 5466 SSRs were identified. Among them, mono-nucleotides were the most abundant repeat units, accounting for 44.09% followed by tri-, tetra-, penta and hexa-nucleotide repeats. Overall, the present work provides a valuable resource for the population genetics studies of <i>A. sieboldii</i>. Besides, it provides much genomic information for the functional dissection of the drought-resistance in <i>A. sieboldii</i>, which will be useful to understand the bio-regulatory mechanisms linked with drought-tolerance to enhance its yield.
