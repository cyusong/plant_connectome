['12068105', "SPY (SPINDLY) encodes a putative O-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine transferase that  is genetically defined as a negatively acting component of the gibberellin (GA)  signal transduction pathway. Analysis of Arabidopsis plants containing a SPY::GUS  reporter gene reveals that SPY is expressed throughout the life of the plant and  in most plant organs examined. In addition to being expressed in all organs where  phenotypes due to spy mutations have been reported, SPY::GUS is expressed in the  root. Examination of the roots of wild-type, spy, and gai plants revealed  phenotypes indicating that SPY and GAI play a role in root development. A second  SPY::GUS reporter gene lacking part of the SPY promoter was inactive, suggesting  that sequences in the first exon and/or intron are required for detectable  expression. Using both subcellular fractionation and visualization of a SPY-green  fluorescent protein fusion protein that is able to rescue the spy mutant  phenotype, the majority of SPY protein was shown to be present in the nucleus.  This result is consistent with the nuclear localization of other components of  the GA response pathway and suggests that SPY's role as a negative regulator of  GA signaling involves interaction with other nuclear proteins and/or  O-N-acetyl-glucosamine modification of these proteins.", '2002 Jun', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.020002', 'Olszewski']
