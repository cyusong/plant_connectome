Ethylene is known to play an essential role in mediating hypoxic responses in plants. Here, we show that in addition to regulating hypoxic responses, ethylene also regulates cellular responses in the reoxygenation stage after anoxic treatment in Arabidopsis. We found that expression of several ethylene biosynthetic genes and ethylene-responsive factors, including ERF1 and ERF2, was induced during reoxygenation. Compared with the wild type, two ethylene-insensitive mutants (ein2-5 and ein3eil1) were more sensitive to reoxygenation and displayed damaged phenotypes during reoxygenation. To characterize the role of ethylene, we applied microarray analysis to Col-0, ein2-5 and ein3eil1 under reoxygenation conditions. Our results showed that gene transcripts involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, dehydration response and metabolic processes were regulated during reoxygenation. Moreover, ethylene signalling may participate in regulating these responses and maintaining the homeostasis of different phytohormones. Our work presents evidence that ethylene has distinct functions in recovery after anoxia and provides insight into the reoxygenation signalling network.
