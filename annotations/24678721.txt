['24678721', 'Methylation of cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is important for gene  expression, gene imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and transposon silencing.  Active demethylation in animals is believed to proceed by DNA glycosylase removal  of deaminated or oxidized 5mC. In plants, 5mC is removed from the genome directly  by the DEMETER (DME) family of DNA glycosylases. Arabidopsis thaliana DME excises  5mC to activate expression of maternally imprinted genes. Although the related  Repressor of Silencing 1 (ROS1) enzyme has been characterized, the molecular  basis for 5mC recognition by DME has not been investigated. Here, we present a  structure-function analysis of DME and the related DME-like 3 (DML3) glycosylases  for 5mC and its oxidized derivatives. Relative to 5mC, DME and DML3 exhibited  robust activity toward 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, limited activity for  5-carboxylcytosine, and no activity for 5-formylcytosine. We used homology  modeling and mutational analysis of base excision and DNA binding to identify  residues important for recognition of 5mC within the context of DNA and inside  the enzyme active site. Our results indicate that the 5mC binding pocket is  composed of residues from discrete domains and is responsible for discrimination  against 5mC derivatives, and suggest that DME, ROS1, and DML3 utilize subtly  different mechanisms to probe the DNA duplex for cytosine modifications.', '2014 Apr 22', 'Biochemistry', '10.1021/bi5002294', 'Eichman']
