['15876431', 'SNAREs (soluble N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors)  which locate on the specific organelle membrane assure the correct vesicular  transport by mediating specific membrane fusions. SNAREs are referred to as R- or  Q-SNAREs on the basis of the amino acid sequence similarities and specific  conserved residues. All of the Arabidopsis R-SNAREs have a N-terminal domain,  called the longin domain (LD). In this study, we investigated the vacuolar  targeting mechanism of Arabidopsis R-SNAREs. The vacuolar localized AtVAMP711 was  used as the mother protein of GFP-tagged chimeric proteins joined to several  domains such as the LD, the SNARE motif (SNM) and the transmembrane domain (TMD)  of other organelle-localized R-SNAREs. The results showed that, whereas the TMD  is not relevant for the vacuolar targeting, a complete LD is essential for the  vacuolar and subcellular targeting.', '2005 May 23', 'FEBS Lett', '10.1016/j.febslet.2005.04.022', 'Takeyasu']
