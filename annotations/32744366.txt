Root microbiomes are established through selective recruitment by host plants from pools of potential partners. However, the assembly rules of root microbiomes remain unclear. To elucidate (i) the effects of host plant phylogeny on root microbiome assembly and (ii) which microbial groups affect differences in root microbiome assemblies, the structures of bacterial and fungal root microbiomes from 20 cultivated angiosperms were compared. Surface-sterilized seeds from each species were sown in identical soil, and DNA was extracted from the plant roots after 7-8 weeks. The bacterial (16S rRNA) and fungal (ITS) communities were then examined using Illumina MiSeq. The phylogenetic distances of host plants and assembly dissimilarities of bacterial microbiomes, but not of fungal ones, were significantly correlated, as were the topologies of the host plant phylogenetic tree and the community dissimilarity tree, thereby confirming the phylogenetic conservation of bacterial root microbiomes. Furthermore, host plant phylogeny mainly affected only a few specific bacterial lineages, including the Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Burkholderia (Betaproteobacteria) taxa were more abundant in monocots than in dicots, whereas Streptomyces (Actinobacteria) taxa were less abundant. These findings suggest that bacterial root microbiomes have significantly contributed to the functional divergence of angiosperms at higher taxonomic levels.
