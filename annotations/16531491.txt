['16531491', 'In multicellular organisms, patterning is a process that generates axes in the  primary body plan, creates domains upon organ formation, and finally leads to  differentiation into tissues and cell types. We identified the Arabidopsis  thaliana TORNADO1 (TRN1) and TRN2 genes and their role in leaf patterning  processes such as lamina venation, symmetry, and lateral growth. In trn mutants,  the leaf venation network had a severely reduced complexity: incomplete loops, no  tertiary or quaternary veins, and vascular islands. The leaf laminas were  asymmetric and narrow because of a severely reduced cell number. We postulate  that the imbalance between cell proliferation and cell differentiation and the  altered auxin distribution in both trn mutants cause asymmetric leaf growth and  aberrant venation patterning. TRN1 and TRN2 were epistatic to ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1  with respect to leaf asymmetry, consistent with their expression in the shoot  apical meristem and leaf primordia. TRN1 codes for a large plant-specific protein  with conserved domains also found in a variety of signaling proteins, whereas  TRN2 encodes a transmembrane protein of the tetraspanin family whose phylogenetic  tree is presented. Double mutant analysis showed that TRN1 and TRN2 act in the  same pathway.', '2006 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.040568', 'Van']
