* The ability of hydrothermal time (HTT) and virtual osmotic potential (VOP) models to describe the kinetics of maize (Zea mays) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum) seed germination under variable conditions of water potential was investigated with a view to gaining an improved understanding of the impact of on-farm seed priming on seedling establishment through simulation. * Germination and/or imbibition time courses were recorded over a wide range of constant temperatures and water potentials and simple stepwise changes in water potential. * Both models adequately described germination under constant environmental conditions, but not conditions of water potential that varied. To test the hypothesis that this inaccuracy resulted from the use of ambient water potential, a parsimonious model of seed imbibition was developed to calibrate the HTT and VOP models (IHTT and IVOP) and drive them with estimates of seed water potential. * The IHTT and IVOP models described germination during stepwise changes in water potential more accurately than the conventional models, and should contribute to improved predictions of germination time in the field.
