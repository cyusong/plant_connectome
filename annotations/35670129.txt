['35670129', "The number of meiotic crossovers is tightly controlled and most depend on  pro-crossover ZMM proteins, such as the E3 ligase HEI10. Despite the importance  of HEI10 dosage for crossover formation, how HEI10 transcription is controlled  remains unexplored. In a forward genetic screen using a fluorescent crossover  reporter in Arabidopsis thaliana, we identify heat shock factor binding protein  (HSBP) as a repressor of HEI10 transcription and crossover numbers. Using  genome-wide crossover mapping and cytogenetics, we show that hsbp mutations or  meiotic HSBP knockdowns increase ZMM-dependent crossovers toward the telomeres,  mirroring the effects of HEI10 overexpression. Through RNA sequencing, DNA  methylome, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we reveal that HSBP is  required to repress HEI10 transcription by binding with heat shock factors (HSFs)  at the HEI10 promoter and maintaining DNA methylation over the HEI10 5'  untranslated region. Our findings provide insights into how the temperature  response regulator HSBP restricts meiotic HEI10 transcription and crossover  number by attenuating HSF activity.", '2022 Jul 18', 'EMBO J', '10.15252/embj.2021109958', 'ORCID:']
