To develop a robust basis for inferences about population genetics and evolution, this work assayed 192 aspens (Populus tremuloides) from 11 sites in Wisconsin, USA, for allelic and population variation at 16 microsatellite loci distributed across the Populus genome. Frequency distributions of fluorochrome-labeled alleles resolved by capillary electrophoresis were analyzed for relationships to repeat size and number. Population-level statistics were compared with those of other studies, especially in Populus. All loci were polymorphic, varying widely in the number of alleles per locus (mean = 8.25, range 2-20). Expected and observed heterozygosities were high (0.45 and 0.41, respectively), with little differentiation among populations (F(ST) = 0.006-0.045) and a moderate level of inbreeding (F(IS) = 0.09), intermediate among levels reported in studies based on isozymes. Contrary to several other reports, allele frequencies clustered tightly around the modal frequency, and the genetic diversity (measured as alleles per locus or as expected heterozygosity) was not related to either the repeat unit size or to the number of repeats.
