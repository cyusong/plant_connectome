Pear (Pyrus pyrifolia L.) has a S-RNase-based gametophytic self-incompatibility (SI) mechanism, and S-RNase has also been implicated in the rejection of self-pollen and genetically identical pollen. No studies, however, have examined the extent of organelle alterations during the SI response in Pyrus pyrifolia. Consequently, this study focused on the alterations to mitochondria and nuclear DNA in incompatible pollen tubes of the pear. Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide was used to evaluate the viability of pollen tubes under S-RNase challenge. The results showed that the viability of the control and compatible pollen tubes decreased slightly, but that of the incompatible pollen and pollen tubes began to decline at 30 min. The mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi(mit)) was also tested with rhodamine 123 30 min after SI challenge, and was shown to have collapsed in the incompatible pollen tubes after exposure to S-RNase. Western blotting 2 h after SI challenge confirmed that the Delta psi(mit) collapse induced leakage of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Swollen mitochondria were detected by transmission electron microscopy as early as 1 h after SI challenge and the degradation of nuclear DNA was observed by both 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling. These diagnostic features of programmed cell death (PCD) suggested that PCD may specifically occur in incompatible pollen tubes.
