['18281508', 'Polarized expansion of root hair cells in Arabidopsis thaliana is improperly  controlled in root hair-defective rhd4-1 mutant plants, resulting in root hairs  that are shorter and randomly form bulges along their length. Using time-lapse  fluorescence microscopy in rhd4-1 root hairs, we analyzed membrane dynamics after  labeling with RabA4b, a marker for polarized membrane trafficking in root hairs.  This revealed stochastic loss and recovery of the RabA4b compartment in the tips  of growing root hairs, consistent with a role for the RHD4 protein in regulation  of polarized membrane trafficking in these cells. The wild-type RHD4 gene was  identified by map-based cloning and was found to encode a Sac1p-like  phosphoinositide phosphatase. RHD4 displayed a preference for  phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P] in vitro, and rhd4-1 roots accumulated  higher levels of PI(4)P in vivo. In wild-type root hairs, PI(4)P accumulated  primarily in a tip-localized plasma membrane domain, but in rhd4-1 mutants,  significant levels of PI(4)P were detected associated with internal membranes. A  fluorescent RHD4 fusion protein localized to membranes at the tips of growing  root hairs. We propose that RHD4 is selectively recruited to RabA4b-labeled  membranes that are involved in polarized expansion of root hair cells and that,  in conjunction with the phosphoinositide kinase PI-4Kbeta1, RHD4 regulates the  accumulation of PI(4)P on membrane compartments at the tips of growing root  hairs.', '2008 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.107.054304', 'Nielsen']
