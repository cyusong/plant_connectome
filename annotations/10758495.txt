['10758495', "The brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthetic pathway, and the sterol pathway which is  prerequisite to the BR pathway, are rapidly being characterized because of the  availability of a large number of characteristic dwarf mutants in Arabidopsis.  Here we show that the Arabidopsis dwarf5 mutants are disrupted in a sterol Delta7  reduction step. dwf5 plants display the characteristic dwarf phenotype typical of  other BR mutants. This phenotype includes small, round, dark-green leaves, and  short stems, pedicels, and petioles. Metabolite tracing with 13C-labeled  precursors in dwf5 verified a deficiency in a sterol Delta7 reductase activity.  All six independent alleles contain loss-of-function mutations in the sterol  Delta7 reductase gene. These include a putative mRNA instability mutation in  dwf5-1, 3' and 5' splice-site mutations in dwf5-2 and dwf5-6, respectively,  premature stop codons in dwf5-3 (R400Z) and dwf5-5 (R409Z), and a mis-sense  mutation in dwf5-4 (D257N). The dwf5 plant could be restored to wild type by  ectopic overexpression of the wild-type copy of the gene. Both the Arabidopsis  dwf5 phenotype and the human Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome are caused by  loss-of-function mutations in a sterol Delta7 reductase gene, indicating that it  is required for the proper growth and development of these two organisms.", '2000 Mar', 'Plant J', '10.1046/j.1365-313x.2000.00693.x', 'Feldmann']
