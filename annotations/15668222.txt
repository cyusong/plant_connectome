Changes in AA-GSH cycle activity following Botrytis cinerea infection were studied in tomato whole-leaf extracts as well as in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. The oxidative effect of infection affected all cellular compartments although mitochondria and peroxisomes underwent the most pronounced changes. Apart from organelle-specific variations, a general shift of the cellular redox balance towards the oxidative state was found. It was manifested by the significant decline in concentrations and redox ratios of the ascorbate and glutathione pools as well as by the insufficient activity of MDHAR, DHAR, and GR needed for antioxidant regeneration. There was no compatibility between the ascorbate- and glutathione-mediated changes in different compartments. It was concluded that B. cinerea was able to break down the protective antioxidant barrier of the AA-GSH cycle at both the cellular and organellar levels. The changes in the AA-GSH cycle activity could partly be related to the B. cinerea-induced promotion of senescence that favoured disease progress.
