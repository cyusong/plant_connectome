Deployment of new model species in the plant biology community requires the development and/or improvement of numerous genetic tools. Sequencing of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome opened up a new challenge of assigning biological function to each gene. As many genes exhibit spatiotemporal or other conditional regulation of biological processes, probing for gene function necessitates applications that can be geared toward temporal, spatial and quantitative functional analysis in vivo. The continuing quest to establish new platforms to examine plant gene function has resulted in the availability of numerous genomic and proteomic tools. Classical and more recent genome-wide experimental approaches include conventional mutagenesis, tagged DNA insertional mutagenesis, ectopic expression of transgenes, activation tagging, RNA interference and two-component transactivation systems. The utilization of these molecular tools has resulted in conclusive evidence for the existence of many genes, and expanded knowledge on gene structure and function. This review covers several molecular tools that have become increasingly useful in basic plant research. We discuss their advantages and limitations for probing cellular protein function while emphasizing the contributions made to lay the fundamental groundwork for genetic manipulation of crops using plant biotechnology.
