['31198941', 'Unlike animal cells, plant cells do not possess centrosomes that serve as  microtubule organizing centers; how microtubule arrays are organized throughout  plant morphogenesis remains poorly understood. We report here that Arabidopsis  INCREASED PETAL GROWTH ANISOTROPY 1 (IPGA1), a previously uncharacterized  microtubule-associated protein, regulates petal growth and shape by affecting  cortical microtubule organization. Through a genetic screen, we showed that IPGA1  loss-of-function mutants displayed a phenotype of longer and narrower petals, as  well as increased anisotropic cell expansion of the petal epidermis in the late  phases of flower development. Map-based cloning studies revealed that IPGA1  encodes a previously uncharacterized protein that colocalizes with and directly  binds to microtubules. IPGA1 plays a negative role in the organization of  cortical microtubules into parallel arrays oriented perpendicular to the axis of  cell elongation, with the ipga1-1 mutant displaying increased microtubule  ordering in petal abaxial epidermal cells. The IPGA1 family is conserved among  land plants and its homologs may have evolved to regulate microtubule  organization. Taken together, our findings identify IPGA1 as a novel  microtubule-associated protein and provide significant insights into  IPGA1-mediated microtubule organization and petal growth anisotropy.', '2019 Oct 15', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erz284', 'Lin']
