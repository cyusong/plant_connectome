['18839316', 'Previous microarray analyses of Arabidopsis roots identified two closely related  WRKY transcription factors (WRKY25 and WRKY33) among the transcripts that  increased in abundance following treatment with NaCl. Here, we report further  characterization of these genes, which we found to be inducible by a variety of  abiotic stresses in an SOS-pathway independent manner, although WRKY33 induction  was dependent on ABA signaling. Transcripts of both genes were detected in roots  and leaves, while specific patterns of enrichment were observed in stems and  floral buds for WRKY25 and WRKY33, respectively. We also identified upstream  intergenic regions from each gene that were sufficient to confer stress-inducible  expression on a reporter gene. However, the stress sensitivity of wrky25 null  mutants did not differ from wild-type under any assay condition, while wrky33  null mutants and wrky25wrky33 double mutants showed only a moderate increase in  NaCl-sensitivity, suggesting functional redundancy with other transcription  factors. Nevertheless, overexpression of WRKY25 or WRKY33 was sufficient to  increase Arabidopsis NaCl tolerance, while increasing sensitivity to ABA. Through  microarray analyses of relevant genotypes, we identified 31 and 208 potential  downstream targets of WRKY25 and WRKY33, respectively, most of which contained a  W-box in their upstream regions.', '2009 Jan', 'Plant Mol Biol', '10.1007/s11103-008-9408-3', 'Deyholos']
