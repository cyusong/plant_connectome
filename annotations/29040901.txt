The aim of the study was to improve the effect of stratification of apple "Ligol" seeds by application of selected compounds, phytohormones, and physical methods For this purpose the seeds were stratified at 3°C in distilled water or in the presence of potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>), ethephon (ET), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), a mixture of KNO<sub>3</sub>, ET, CO, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, gibberellins (GA<sub>3</sub>), 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and a mixture of SA, GA<sub>3</sub>, BAP, JA, nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen chloride (HCL). Arranged protocols included various durations and combinations of selected compounds and phytohormones as well as laser and red light, heat shock - 2h heat shock (45°C) and Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF) were investigated by germination tests and the activity of selected enzymes, gas exchange and index of chlorophyll in leaves. The obtained results showed the possibility to shorten more effectively the time of the apple 'Ligol' dormancy removal by treatments of the stratified seeds at 3°C with different biological and physical methods Selected compounds and phytohormones acted collectively as a regulatory complex controlling the course of release from dormancy. Physical methods (PRF and heat shock) additionally contributed to dormancy breakage. Duration of phytohormones or compounds impacts during stratification should be prolonged to minimum 7days to assure more balanced conditions of the regulatory complex for the acceleration of dormancy a removal. The most beneficial results were obtained after seed stratification for 7days on filter paper moistened in KNO<sub>3</sub>+Etephon+CO+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at 3°C, and then on filter paper moistened in phytohormones (GA<sub>3</sub>+BAP+JA) till the end of seed germination (3°C). The application of this protocol could be a very useful tool in a shortening the apple breeding cycle since the period of removing dormancy was reduced by 38days in comparison to stratified in water. PRF has also the additive role in breaking dormancy of apple 'Ligol' seed. Positive effects of compounds and phytohormones applied during stratification remarkably accelerated the growth of developed from them seedlings. Further research is needed to optimize stratification methods with appropriate contents and concentrations of compounds and phytohormones combined with PRF exposure.
