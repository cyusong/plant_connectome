Using gene targeting by homologous recombination in Ceratodon purpureus, we were able to knock out four phytochrome photoreceptor genes independently and to analyze their function with respect to red light dependent phototropism, polarotropism, and chlorophyll content. The strongest phenotype was found in knock-out lines of a newly described phytochrome gene termed CpPHY4 lacking photo- and polarotropic responses at moderate fluence rates. Eliminating the atypical phytochrome gene CpPHY1, which is the only known phytochrome-like gene containing a putative C-terminal tyrosine kinase-like domain, affects red light-induced chlorophyll accumulation. This result was surprising, since no light dependent function was ever allocated to this unusual gene.

CpPHY4: !lacks! phototropic/polarotropic responses
CpPHY1: !affects! chlorophyll accumulation
CpPHY4: !represses! CpPHY1
