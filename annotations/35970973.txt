How specificity is conferred within gene regulatory networks is an important problem in biology. The basic helix-loop-helix PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) and single zinc-finger CYCLING DOF FACTORs (CDFs) mediate growth responses of Arabidopsis to light and temperature. We show that these two classes of transcription factor (TF) act cooperatively. CDF2 and PIF4 are temporally and spatially co-expressed, they interact to form a protein complex and act in the same genetic pathway to promote hypocotyl cell elongation. Furthermore, PIF4 substantially strengthens genome-wide occupancy of CDF2 at a subset of its target genes. One of these, YUCCA8, encodes an auxin biosynthesis enzyme whose transcription is increased by PIF4 and CDF2 to contribute to hypocotyl elongation. The binding sites of PIF4 and CDF2 in YUCCA8 are closely spaced, and in vitro PIF4 enhances binding of CDF2. We propose that this occurs by direct protein interaction and because PIF4 binding alters DNA conformation. Thus, we define mechanisms by which PIF and CDF TFs cooperate to achieve regulatory specificity and promote cell elongation in response to light.
