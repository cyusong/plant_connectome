Time-dependent contact angle measurements of pure water on barley leaf surfaces allow quantifying the kinetics of surfactant diffusion into the leaf. Barley leaf surfaces were sprayed with three different aqueous concentrations (0.1, 1.0 and 10%) of a monodisperse (tetraethylene glycol monododecyl ether) and a polydisperse alcohol ethoxylate (BrijL4). After 10 min, the surfactant solutions on the leaf surfaces were dry leading to surfactant coverages of 1, 10 and 63 µg cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. The highest surfactant coverage (63 µg cm<sup>-2</sup>) affected leaf physiology (photosynthesis and water loss) rapidly and irreversibly and leaves were dying within 2-6 h. These effects on leaf physiology did not occur with the lower surfactant coverages (1 and 10 µg cm<sup>-2</sup>). Directly after spraying of 0.1 and 1.0% surfactant solution and complete drying (10 min), leaf surfaces were fully wettable for pure water and contact angles were 0°. Within 60 min (0.1% surfactant) and 6 h (1.0% surfactant), leaf surfaces were non-wettable again and contact angles of pure water were identical to control leaves. Scanning electron microscopy investigations directly performed after surfactant spraying and drying indicated that leaf surface wax crystallites were partially or fully covered by surfactants. Wax platelets with unaltered microstructure were fully visible again within 2 to 6 h after treatment with 0.1% surfactant solutions. Gas chromatographic analysis showed that surfactant amounts on leaf surfaces continuously disappeared over time. Our results indicate that surfactants, applied at realistic coverages between 1 and 10 µg cm<sup>-2</sup> to barley leaf surfaces, leading to total wetting (contact angles of 0°) of leaf surfaces, are rapidly taken up by the leaves. As a consequence, leaf surface non-wettability is fully reappearing. An irreversible damage of the leaf surface fine structure leading to enhanced wetting and increased foliar transpiration seems highly unlikely at low surfactant coverages of 1 µg cm<sup>-2</sup>.
