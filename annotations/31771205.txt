Plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) are beneficial microorganisms that can also protect against disease and environmental stress. Silicon (Si) is the second most abundant element in soil, and is known to increase plant growth, grain yield, resistance to biotic stress, and tolerance to abiotic stress. Combined treatment of PGPB and Si has been shown to further enhance plant growth and crop yield. To determine the global effects of the PGPB and Si on rice growth, we compared rice plants treated with <i>Paenibacillus yonginensis</i> DCY84<sup>T</sup> (DCY84<sup>T</sup>) and Si with untreated rice. To identify the genes that respond to DCY84<sup>T</sup>+Si treatment in rice, we performed an RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis by sampling treated and untreated roots on a weekly basis for three weeks. Overall, 576 genes were upregulated, and 394 genes were downregulated in treated roots, using threshold fold-changes of at least 2 (log<sub>2</sub>) and <i>p</i>-values < 0.05. Gene ontology analysis showed that phenylpropanoids and the L-phenylalanine metabolic process were prominent in the upregulated genes. In a metabolic overview analysis using the MapMan toolkit, pathways involving phenylpropanoids and ethylene were strongly associated with upregulated genes. The functions of seven upregulated genes were identified as being associated with drought stress through a literature search, and a stress experiment confirmed that plants treated with DCY84<sup>T</sup>+Si exhibited greater drought tolerance than the untreated control plants. Furthermore, the predicted protein-protein interaction network analysis associated with DCY84<sup>T</sup>+ Si suggests mechanisms underlying growth promotion and stress tolerance.
