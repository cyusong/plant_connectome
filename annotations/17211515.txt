The expression of 7,835 genes in developing wheat caryopses was analyzed using cDNA arrays. Using a mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) method, 29% (2,237) of the genes on the array were identified to be differentially expressed at the 6 different time-points examined, which covers the developmental stages from coenocytic endosperm to physiological maturity. Comparison of genes differentially expressed between two time-points revealed a dynamic transcript accumulation profile with major re-programming events that occur at 3-7, 7-14 and 21-28 DPA. A k-means clustering algorithm grouped the differentially expressed genes into 10 clusters, revealing co-expression of genes involved in the same pathway such as carbohydrate and protein synthesis or preparation for desiccation. Functional annotation of genes that show peak expression at specific time-points correlated with the developmental events associated with the respective stages. Results provide information on the temporal expression during caryopsis development for a significant number of differentially expressed genes with unknown function.
