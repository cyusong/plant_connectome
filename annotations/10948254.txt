['10948254', 'A new subfamily of sucrose transporters from Arabidopsis (AtSUT4), tomato  (LeSUT4), and potato (StSUT4) was isolated, demonstrating only 47% similarity to  the previously characterized SUT1. SUT4 from two plant species conferred sucrose  uptake activity when expressed in yeast. The K(m) for sucrose uptake by AtSUT4 of  11.6 +/- 0.6 mM was approximately 10-fold greater than for all other plant  sucrose transporters characterized to date. An ortholog from potato had similar  kinetic properties. Thus, SUT4 corresponds to the low-affinity/high-capacity  saturable component of sucrose uptake found in leaves. In contrast to SUT1, SUT4  is expressed predominantly in minor veins in source leaves, where high-capacity  sucrose transport is needed for phloem loading. In potato and tomato, SUT4 was  immunolocalized specifically to enucleate sieve elements, indicating that like  SUT1, macromolecular trafficking is required to transport the mRNA or the protein  from companion cells through plasmodesmata into the sieve elements.', '2000 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.12.8.1345', 'Ward']
