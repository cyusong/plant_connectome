The evolution of Na<sup>+</sup>-selective four-domain voltage-gated channels (4D-Na<sub>v</sub>s) in animals allowed rapid Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent electrical excitability, and enabled the development of sophisticated systems for rapid and long-range signaling. While bacteria encode single-domain Na<sup>+</sup>-selective voltage-gated channels (BacNa<sub>v</sub>), they typically exhibit much slower kinetics than 4D-Na<sub>v</sub>s, and are not thought to have crossed the prokaryote-eukaryote boundary. As such, the capacity for rapid Na<sup>+</sup>-selective signaling is considered to be confined to certain animal taxa, and absent from photosynthetic eukaryotes. Certainly, in land plants, such as the Venus flytrap (<i>Dionaea muscipula</i>) where fast electrical excitability has been described, this is most likely based on fast anion channels. Here, we report a unique class of eukaryotic Na<sup>+</sup>-selective, single-domain channels (EukCatBs) that are present primarily in haptophyte algae, including the ecologically important calcifying coccolithophores, <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i> and <i>Scyphosphaera apsteinii</i> The EukCatB channels exhibit very rapid voltage-dependent activation and inactivation kinetics, and isoform-specific sensitivity to the highly selective 4D-Na<sub>v</sub> blocker tetrodotoxin. The results demonstrate that the capacity for rapid Na<sup>+</sup>-based signaling in eukaryotes is not restricted to animals or to the presence of 4D-Na<sub>v</sub>s. The EukCatB channels therefore represent an independent evolution of fast Na<sup>+</sup>-based electrical signaling in eukaryotes that likely contribute to sophisticated cellular control mechanisms operating on very short time scales in unicellular algae.
