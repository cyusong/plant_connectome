['29184027', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-P (PI3P) is a signaling molecule that controls a variety  of processes in endosomal, autophagic, and vacuolar/lysosomal trafficking in  yeasts and mammals. Vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34) is a conserved PI3K  present in multiple complexes with specific functions and regulation. In yeast,  the PI3K complex II consists of Vps34p, Vps15p, Vps30p/Atg6p, and Vps38p, and is  essential for vacuolar protein sorting. Here, we describe the Arabidopsis  (Arabidopsis thaliana) homolog of yeast Vps38p and human UV radiation  resistance-associated gene protein. Arabidopsis VPS38 interacts with VPS30/ATG6  both in yeast and in planta. Although the level of PI3P in Arabidopsis vps38  mutants is similar to that in wild type, vps38 cells contain enlarged  multivesicular endosomes and fewer organelles enriched in PI3P than the wild  type. The vps38 mutants are defective in the trafficking of vacuolar cargo and  its receptor VACUOLAR SORTING RECEPTOR2;1. The mutants also exhibit abnormal  cytoplasmic distributions of endocytic cargo, such as auxin efflux carriers  PINFORMED1 (PIN1) and PIN2. Constitutive autophagy is normal in the mutants but  starvation-induced autophagy was slightly inhibited. We conclude that Arabidopsis  VPS38 is dispensable for autophagy but essential for efficient targeting of  biosynthetic and endocytic cargo to the vacuole.', '2018 Feb', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.17.01297', 'ORCID:']
