Crops such as wheat (Triticum spp.) are predicted to face more frequent exposures to heat stress as a result of climate change. Increasing the yield and sustainability of yield under such stressful conditions has long been a major target of wheat breeding, and this goal is becoming increasingly urgent as the global population increases. Exposure of wheat plants in their reproductive or grain-filling stage to high temperature affects the duration and rate of grain filling, and hence has a negative impact on wheat productivity. Therefore, understanding the plasticity of the response to heat stress that exists between wheat genotypes, especially in source-sink relationships at the reproductive and grain-filling stages, is critical for the selection of germplasm that can maintain high yields under heat stress. A broad understanding of metabolic dynamics and the relationships between metabolism and heat tolerance is required in order to achieve this goal. Here, we review the current literature concerning the effects of heat stress on sink-source relationships in a wide range of wheat genotypes, and highlight the current metabolomic approaches that are used to investigate high temperature responses in wheat.
