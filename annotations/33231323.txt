The afterglow (AG) photosynthetic luminescence is a long-lived chlorophyll fluorescence emitted from PSII after the illumination of photosynthetic materials by FR or white light and placed in darkness. The AG emission corresponds to the fraction of PSII centers in the S<sub>2/3</sub> Q<sub>B</sub> non-radiative state immediately after pre-illumination, in which the arrival of an electron transferred from stroma along cyclic/chlororespiratory pathway(s) produces the S<sub>2/3</sub> Q<sub>B</sub> <sup>-</sup> radiative state that emits luminescence. This emission can be optimally recorded by a linear temperature gradient as sharp thermoluminescence (TL) band peaking at about 45°C. The AG emission recorded by TL technique has been proposed as a simple non-invasive tool to investigate the chloroplast energetic state and some of its metabolism processes as cyclic transport of electrons around PSI, chlororespiration or photorespiration. On the other hand, this emission has demonstrated to be a useful probe to study the effect of various stress conditions in photosynthetic materials.
