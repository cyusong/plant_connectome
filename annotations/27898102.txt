['27898102', 'Programmed cell death (PCD) is critical for development and responses to  environmental stimuli in many organisms. FUZZY ONIONS (FZO) proteins in yeast,  flies, and mammals are known to affect mitochondrial fusion and function.  Arabidopsis FZO-LIKE (FZL) was shown as a chloroplast protein that regulates  chloroplast morphology and cell death. We cloned the FZL gene based on the lesion  mimic phenotype conferred by an fzl mutation. Here we provide evidence to support  that FZL has evolved new function different from its homologs from other  organisms. We found that fzl mutants showed enhanced disease resistance to the  bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and the oomycete pathogen  Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Besides altered chloroplast morphology and cell  death, fzl showed the activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy  pathways. FZL and the defense signaling molecule salicylic acid form a negative  feedback loop in defense and cell death control. FZL did not complement the yeast  strain lacking the FZO1 gene. Together these data suggest that the Arabidopsis  FZL gene is a negative regulator of cell death and disease resistance, possibly  through regulating ROS and autophagy pathways in the chloroplast.', '2016 Nov 29', 'Sci Rep', '10.1038/srep37797', 'Lu']
