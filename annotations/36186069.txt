<i>Cenchrus ciliaris</i> is an apomictic, allotetraploid pasture grass widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. In this study, we aimed to investigate the genomic organization and characterize some of the repetitive DNA sequences in this species. Due to the apomictic propagation, various aneuploid genotypes are found, and here, we analyzed a 2<i>n</i> = 4x + 3 = 39 accession. The physical mapping of Ty1-<i>copia</i> and Ty3-<i>gypsy</i> retroelements through fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization with a global assessment of 5-methylcytosine DNA methylation through immunostaining revealed the genome-wide distribution pattern of retroelements and their association with DNA methylation. Approximately one-third of Ty1-<i>copia</i> sites overlapped or spanned centromeric DAPI-positive heterochromatin, while the centromeric regions and arms of some chromosomes were labeled with Ty3-<i>gypsy</i>. Most of the retroelement sites overlapped with 5-methylcytosine signals, except for some Ty3-<i>gypsy</i> on the arms of chromosomes, which did not overlap with anti-5-mC signals. Universal retrotransposon probes did not distinguish genomes of <i>C. ciliaris</i> showing signals in pericentromeric regions of all 39 chromosomes, unlike highly abundant repetitive DNA motifs found in survey genome sequences of <i>C. ciliaris</i> using graph-based clustering. The probes developed from RepeatExplorer clusters gave strong <i>in situ</i> hybridization signals, mostly in pericentromeric regions of about half of the chromosomes, and we suggested that they differentiate the two ancestral genomes in the allotetraploid <i>C. ciliaris</i>, likely having different repeat sequence variants amplified before the genomes came together in the tetraploid.
