Previous results have shown that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is involved in abscisic acid (ABA)-induced adventitious root development under drought stress. In this study, a comparative proteomic analysis was conducted to explore the key proteins during ABA-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced adventitious rooting in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) under drought stress. The results revealed that 48 of 56 detected proteins spots were confidently matched to NCBI database entries. Among them, 10 protein spots were up-regulated while 4 protein spots were down-regulated under drought stress; 22 protein spots were up-regulated by ABA under drought stress; treatment with ABA plus H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> scavenger catalase (CAT) up-regulated 6 protein spots and down-regulated 6 protein spots under drought stress. The identified proteins were divided into three categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. According to their functions, the 48 identified proteins were grouped into 10 categories, including photosynthesis, stress response, protein folding, modification, and degradation, etc. According to subcellular localization, about 24 proteins (half of the total) were predicted to be localized in chloroplasts. ABA significantly up-regulated the expression of photosynthesis-related proteins (SBPase, OEE1), stress-defense-related proteins (2-Cys-Prx, HBP2), and folding-, modification-, and degradation-related proteins (TPal) under drought stress. However, the effects of ABA were inhibited by CAT. The proteins were further analyzed at the transcription level, and the expression of four of five genes (except 2-Cys-Prx) was in accordance with the corresponding protein expression. The protein abundance changes of OEE1 and SBPase were also supported by western blot analysis. Therefore, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may be involved in ABA-induced adventitious root development under drought stress by regulating photosynthesis-related proteins, stress defense-related proteins, and folding-, modification-, and degradation-related proteins.
