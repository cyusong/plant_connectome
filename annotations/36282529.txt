Degradation of starch accumulated in pollen provides energy and cellular materials for pollen germination and pollen tube elongation. Little is known about the function of cytosolic disproportionating enzyme2 (DPE2) in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we obtained several DPE2 knockout mutant (dpe2) lines via genomic editing and found that the mutants grew and developed normally but with greatly reduced seed-setting rates. Reciprocal crosses between dpe2 and wild-type plants demonstrated that the mutant was male sterile. In vitro and in vivo examinations revealed that the pollen of the dpe2 mutant developed and matured normally but was defective in germination and elongation. DPE2 deficiency increased maltose content in pollen, whereas it reduced the levels of starch, glucose, fructose, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Exogenous supply of glucose or ATP to the germination medium partially rescued the pollen germination defects of dpe2. The expression of cytosolic phosphorylase2 (Pho2) increased significantly in dpe2 pollen. Knockout of Pho2 resulted in a semi-sterile phenotype. We failed to obtain homozygous dpe2 pho2 double mutant lines. Our results demonstrate that maltose catalyzed by DPE2 to glucose is the main energy source for pollen germination and pollen tube elongation, while Pho2 might partially compensate for deficiency of DPE2.
