['26795144', 'Transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana lines with constitutive expression of an  Arabidopsis lectin receptor kinase gene (LecRK - I.9 or LecRK - IX.1) show  enhanced resistance to Phytophthora pathogens, demonstrating conserved gene  functionality after interfamily transfer. In plants, cell surface receptors  mediate the first layer of innate immunity against pathogenic microbes. In  Arabidopsis several L-type lectin receptor kinases (LecRKs) were previously found  to function as Phytophthora resistance components. In this study, we determined  the functionality of Arabidopsis LecRK-I.9 or LecRK-IX.1 in Phytophthora  resistance when transferred into the Solanaceous plant Nicotiana benthamiana.  Multiple transgenic lines were generated for each LecRK gene and molecular  analyses revealed variation in transgene copy number, transgene expression levels  and LecRK protein accumulation. Infection assays showed that transgenic N.  benthamiana plants expressing either Arabidopsis LecRK-I.9 or LecRK-IX.1 are more  resistant to Phytophthora capsici and to Phytophthora infestans. These results  demonstrate that Arabidopsis LecRK-I.9 and LecRK-IX.1 retained their Phytophthora  resistance function when transferred into N. benthamiana. Therefore, these LecRKs  have the potential to function as a complementary Phytophthora resistance  resource in distantly related plant species next to the canonical Phytophthora  resistance genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins.', '2016 Apr', 'Plant Cell Rep', '10.1007/s00299-015-1926-2', 'Bouwmeester']
