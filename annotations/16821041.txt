We have developed Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) as a plant virus vector especially for production of pharmaceutical proteins. The CMV vector is a vector modifiable for different host plants and does not require further engineering steps. CMV contains three genomic RNA molecules (RNAs 1-3) necessary for infectivity. With this system, instead of creating different vector constructs for each plant we use, we take advantage of the formation of pseudrecombinants between two CMV isolates by simply reassembling a vector construct (RNA 2 base) and an RNA molecule containing the host determinant (mostly RNA 3). In this study, the gene for acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), one of the human cytokines, was cloned under the control of the subgenomic promoter for RNA 4A of the CMV-based vector, C2-H1. Infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants produced aFGF at levels up to 5-8% of the total soluble protein. The tobacco-produced aFGF was purified, and its biological activity was confirmed. Using this system, which provides a versatile and viable strategy for the production of therapeutic proteins in plants, we also demonstrated a high level of aFGF in Glycine max (soybean) and Arabidopsis thaliana.
