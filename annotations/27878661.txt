OsPHR4 mediates the regulation of Pi-starvation signaling and Pi-homeostasis in a PHR1-subfamily dependent manner in rice. Phosphate (Pi) starvation response is a sophisticated process for plant in the natural environment. In this process, PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 (PHR1) subfamily genes play a central role in regulating Pi-starvation signaling and Pi-homeostasis. Besides the three PHR1 orthologs in Oryza sativa L. (Os) [(Os) PHR1, (Os) PHR2, and (Os) PHR3], which were reported to regulated Pi-starvation signaling and Pi-homeostasis redundantly, a close related PHR1 ortholog [designated as (Os) PHR4] is presented in rice genome with unknown function. In this study, we found that OsPHR4 is a Pi-starvation induced gene and mainly expresses in vascular tissues through all growth and development periods. The expression of OsPHR4 is positively regulated by OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and OsPHR3. The nuclear located OsPHR4 can respectively interact with other three PHR1 subfamily members to regulate downstream Pi-starvation induced genes. Consistent with the positive role of PHR4 in regulating Pi-starvation signaling, the OsPHR4 overexpressors display higher Pi accumulation in the shoot and elevated expression of Pi-starvation induced genes under Pi-sufficient condition. Besides, moderate growth retardation and repression of the Pi-starvation signaling in the OsPHR4 RNA interfering (RNAi) transgenic lines can be observed under Pi-deficient condition. Together, we propose that OsPHR4 mediates the regulation of Pi-starvation signaling and Pi-homeostasis in a PHR1-subfamily dependent manner in rice.
