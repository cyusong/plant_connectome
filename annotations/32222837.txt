Ubiquitin ligase VpRH2 is a negative regulator in the grape ABA pathway by inhibiting ABL1, PYR1 and GRP2A expressions, and its promoter is inhibited by ABA treatment. In higher plants, ubiquitin ligases play key roles in various cellular processes. As in our previous study (Wang et al. in J Exp Bot 68:1669-1687, 2017), grape RING-H2-type ubiquitin ligase gene VpRH2 and its promoter was induced by powdery mildew and showed resistance to the disease. Diverse small-molecule hormones, like salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or abscisic acid (ABA), play pivotal roles in plant resistance. Here we found that VpRH2 expression could be induced by SA and MeJA treatment, but inhibited by ABA treatment. The promoter of VpRH2 revealed a similar variation trend under exogenous hormone treatments as the gene expression by GUS activity assay. By a series of deletion fragments, the promoter fragment of VpRH2-P656 to VpRH2-P513 was necessary in response to MeJA treatment, and the inhibition of ABA treatment to the VpRH2 promoter was independent of the ABRE motif. Over-expression of VpRH2 in Arabidopsis thaliana plants displayed ABA-insensitive phenotypes at the germination stage compared to wild type plants. In VpRH2 over-expressing Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless plants after ABA treatments, the expression of the ABA pathway related genes ABL1 and PYR1 showed a suppresive trend. Moreover, VpGRP2A (an VpRH2-interacting protein) also showed a suppresive trend in response to ABA treatment in VpRH2-overexpressing plants. Our results demonstrate that VpRH2 is a negative regulator in the grape ABA signal pathway by inhibiting ABL1, PYR1 and GRP2A expressions, and its promoter was also inhibited by ABA treatment.
