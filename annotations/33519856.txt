<i>Zanthoxylum</i> L. is an economic crop with a long history of cultivation and domestication and has important economic, ecological, and medicinal value. To solve the classification problems caused by the similar morphological characteristics of <i>Zanthoxylum</i> and establish a credible phylogenetic relationship, we sequenced and annotated six <i>Zanthoxylum</i> chloroplast (cp) genomes (<i>Z. piasezkii, Z. armatum, Z. motuoense, Z. oxyphyllum, Z. multijugum</i>, and <i>Z. calcicola</i>) and combined them with previously published genomes for the <i>Zanthoxylum</i> species. We used bioinformatics methods to analyze the genomic characteristics, contraction, and expansion of inverted repeat (IR) regions; differences in simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and long repeat sequences; species pairwise Ka/Ks ratios; divergence hotspots; and phylogenetic relationships of the 14 <i>Zanthoxylum</i> species. The results revealed that cp genomes of <i>Zanthoxylum</i> range in size from 158,071 to 158,963 bp and contain 87 protein-coding, 37 tRNA, and 8 rRNA genes. Seven mutational hotspots were identified as candidate DNA barcode sequences to distinguish <i>Zanthoxylum</i> species. The phylogenetic analysis strongly supported the genus <i>Fagara</i> as a subgenus of <i>Zanthoxylum</i> and proposed the possibility of a new subgenus in <i>Zanthoxylum.</i> The availability of these genomes will provide valuable information for identifying species, molecular breeding, and evolutionary analysis of <i>Zanthoxylum.</i>
