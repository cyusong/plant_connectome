The SOS (for Salt Overly Sensitive) pathway plays essential roles in conferring salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Under salt stress, the calcium sensor SOS3 activates the kinase SOS2 that positively regulates SOS1, a plasma membrane sodium/proton antiporter. We show that SOS3 acts primarily in roots under salt stress. By contrast, the SOS3 homolog SOS3-LIKE CALCIUM BINDING PROTEIN8 (SCABP8)/CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 functions mainly in the shoot response to salt toxicity. While root growth is reduced in sos3 mutants in the presence of NaCl, the salt sensitivity of scabp8 is more prominent in shoot tissues. SCABP8 is further shown to bind calcium, interact with SOS2 both in vitro and in vivo, recruit SOS2 to the plasma membrane, enhance SOS2 activity in a calcium-dependent manner, and activate SOS1 in yeast. In addition, sos3 scabp8 and sos2 scabp8 display a phenotype similar to sos2, which is more sensitive to salt than either sos3 or scabp8 alone. Overexpression of SCABP8 in sos3 partially rescues the sos3 salt-sensitive phenotype. However, overexpression of SOS3 fails to complement scabp8. These results suggest that SCABP8 and SOS3 are only partially redundant in their function, and each plays additional and unique roles in the plant salt stress response.
