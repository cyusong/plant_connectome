Downy mildew, caused by the biotrophic oomycete Plasmopara viticola, is one of the most economically significant grapevine diseases worldwide. Current strategies to cope with this threat rely on the massive use of chemical compounds during each cultivation season. The economic costs and negative environmental impact associated with these applications increased the urge to search for sustainable strategies of disease control. Improved knowledge of plant mechanisms to counteract pathogen infection may allow the development of alternative strategies for plant protection. Epigenetic regulation, in particular DNA methylation, is emerging as a key factor in the context of plant-pathogen interactions associated with the expression modulation of defence genes. To improve our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underpinning grapevine response to P. viticola, we studied the modulation of both 5-mC methylation and gene expression at 6 and 24 h post-infection (hpi). Leaves of two table grape genotypes (Vitis vinifera), selected by breeding activities for their contrasting level of susceptibility to the pathogen, were analysed. Following pathogen infection, we found variations in the 5-mC methylation level and the gene expression profile. The results indicate a genotype-specific response to pathogen infection. The tolerant genotype (N23/018) at 6 hpi exhibits a lower methylation level compared to the susceptible one (N20/020), and it shows an early modulation (at 6 hpi) of defence and epigenetic-related genes during P. viticola infection. These data suggest that the timing of response is an important mechanism to efficiently counteract the pathogen attack.
