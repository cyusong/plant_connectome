Mitochondria and chloroplasts play key roles in plant-pathogen interactions. Cytidine-to-uridine (C-to-U) RNA editing is a critical posttranscriptional modification in mitochondria and chloroplasts that is specific to flowering plants. Multiple organellar RNA-editing factors (MORFs) form a protein family that participates in C-to-U RNA editing, but little is known regarding their immune functions. Here, we report the identification of <i>NbMORF8</i>, a negative regulator of plant immunity to <i>Phytophthora</i> pathogens. Using virus-induced gene silencing and transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, we show that <i>NbMORF8</i> functions through the regulation of reactive oxygen species production, salicylic acid signaling, and accumulation of multiple Arg-X-Leu-Arg effectors of <i>Phytophthora</i> pathogens. NbMORF8 is localized to mitochondria and chloroplasts, and its immune function requires mitochondrial targeting. The conserved MORF box domain is not required for its immune function. Furthermore, we show that the preferentially mitochondrion-localized NbMORF proteins negatively regulate plant resistance against <i>Phytophthora</i>, whereas the preferentially chloroplast-localized ones are positive immune regulators. Our study reveals that the C-to-U RNA-editing factor <i>NbMORF8</i> negatively regulates plant immunity to the oomycete pathogen <i>Phytophthora</i> and that mitochondrion- and chloroplast-localized NbMORF family members exert opposing effects on immune regulation.
