['21487098', "Plants contain beta-amylase-like proteins (BAMs; enzymes usually associated with  starch breakdown) present in the nucleus rather than targeted to the chloroplast.  They possess BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1 (BZR1)-type DNA binding domains--also found  in transcription factors mediating brassinosteroid (BR) responses. The two  Arabidopsis thaliana BZR1-BAM proteins (BAM7 and BAM8) bind a cis-regulatory  element that both contains a G box and resembles a BR-responsive element. In  protoplast transactivation assays, these BZR1-BAMs activate gene expression.  Structural modeling suggests that the BAM domain's glucan binding cleft is  intact, but the recombinant proteins are at least 1000 times less active than  chloroplastic beta-amylases. Deregulation of BZR1-BAMs (the bam7bam8 double mutant  and BAM8-overexpressing plants) causes altered leaf growth and development. Of  the genes upregulated in plants overexpressing BAM8 and downregulated in bam7bam8  plants, many carry the cis-regulatory element in their promoters. Many genes that  respond to BRs are inversely regulated by BZR1-BAMs. We propose a role for  BZR1-BAMs in controlling plant growth and development through crosstalk with BR  signaling. Furthermore, we speculate that BZR1-BAMs may transmit metabolic  signals by binding a ligand in their BAM domain, although diurnal changes in the  concentration of maltose, a candidate ligand produced by chloroplastic  beta-amylases, do not influence their transcription factor function.", '2011 Apr', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.110.081950', 'Zeeman']
