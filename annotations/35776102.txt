Communication from plastids to the nucleus via retrograde signal cascades is essential to modulate nuclear gene expression, impacting plant development and environmental responses. Recently, a new class of plastid retrograde signals has emerged, consisting of acyclic and cyclic carotenoids and/or their degradation products, apocarotenoids. Although the biochemical identity of many of the apocarotenoid signals is still under current investigation, the examples described herein demonstrate the central roles that these carotenoid-derived signals play in ensuring plant development and survival. We present recent advances in the discovery of apocarotenoid signals and their role in various plant developmental transitions and environmental stress responses. Moreover, we highlight the emerging data exposing the highly complex signal transduction pathways underlying plastid to nucleus apocarotenoid retrograde signaling cascades. Altogether, this review summarizes the central role of the carotenoid pathway as a major source of retrograde signals in plants.
