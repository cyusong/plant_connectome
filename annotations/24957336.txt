['24957336', 'Peptidoglycans (PGNs) are immunogenic bacterial surface patterns that trigger  immune activation in metazoans and plants. It is generally unknown how complex  bacterial structures such as PGNs are perceived by plant pattern recognition  receptors (PRRs) and whether host hydrolytic activities facilitate decomposition  of bacterial matrices and generation of soluble PRR ligands. Here we show that  Arabidopsis thaliana, upon bacterial infection or exposure to microbial patterns,  produces a metazoan lysozyme-like hydrolase (lysozyme 1, LYS1). LYS1 activity  releases soluble PGN fragments from insoluble bacterial cell walls and cleavage  products are able to trigger responses typically associated with plant immunity.  Importantly, LYS1 mutant genotypes exhibit super-susceptibility to bacterial  infections similar to that observed on PGN receptor mutants. We propose that  plants employ hydrolytic activities for the decomposition of complex bacterial  structures, and that soluble pattern generation might aid PRR-mediated immune  activation in cell layers adjacent to infection sites.', '2014 Jun 23', 'Elife', '10.7554/eLife.01990', 'Gust']
