Sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], a C4 crop with high biomass and strong resistance to multiple stresses, can grow and reproduce in saline-alkaline soil and is an ideal raw material for biofuels. Under high-salinity conditions, sweet sorghum shows extensive salt exclusion. However, the specific molecular mechanism of the apoplastic barrier in salt exclusion is unknown. In this study, SbCASP-LP1C1 (a CASP-like protein1C1) was localized in the plasma membrane of sweet sorghum root endodermal cells, and its function was further studied by heterologous expression in Arabidopsis (35 S:SbCASP-LP1C1-GFP). When germinated and grown on 50 mM NaCl, the SbCASP-LP1C1-expressing lines had longer roots and a higher salinity threshold compared with wild-type (Col-0) plant and the casp-lp T-DNA insertion mutant in Arabidopsis. The 35 S:SbCASP-LP1C1-GFP lines also suffered less oxidative damage as determined by DAB and NBT staining, and the expression levels of several antioxidant genes were higher in these lines. Moreover, the stele of 35 S:SbCASP-LP1C1-GFP lines was less permeable to propidium iodide, and these plants contained less Na<sup>+</sup> in their shoots and roots compared to wild type and casp-lp. In the 35 S:SbCASP-LP1C1-GFP lines, the expression levels of two Casparian strip synthesis genes, MYB36 and ESB1, were increased. These results indicate that SbCASP-LP1C1 may be involved in the polymerization of lignin monomers in the Casparian strip of sweet sorghum, thereby regulating salt tolerance. These results provide a theoretical basis to understand the role of plant roots in salt exclusion and a means by which to improve the salt tolerance of crops.
