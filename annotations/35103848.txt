The defense response of potato tubers afflicted with zebra chip disease involves oxidatively mediated upregulation of nucleases that likely modulate localized programmed cell death to restrict the phloem-mobile, CLso bacterial pathogen to the vasculature. Zebra chip (ZC) is a bacterial disease of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) caused by Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum (CLso). Tubers from infected plants develop characteristic brown discoloration of the vasculature, a result of localized programmed cell death (PCD). We examined the potential contribution of nucleases in the response of tubers to CLso infection. Specific activities of the major isozymes of dsDNase, ssDNase, and RNase were substantially upregulated in tubers from CLso-infected plants, despite their significantly lower soluble protein content. However, ZC disease had no effect on nuclease isozyme profiles. Activities of the predominant nuclease isoforms from healthy and CLso-infected tubers had similar pH optima, thermotolerance, and responses to metallic co-factors. Nuclease activities were heat stable to 60 °C and resistant to precipitation with 70% (v/v) isopropanol, which constitute effective techniques for partial purification. DNase and RNase isozyme activities were highest at pH 7.2-8.5 and 6.8-7.2, respectively, and profiles were similar for tubers from CLso-infected and non-infected plants. RNase activities were mostly insensitive to inhibition by EDTA, except at pH 8.5 and above. DNase activities were inhibited by EDTA but less sensitive to inhibition at high pH than the RNases. The EDTA-mediated inhibition of DNase (ds/ss) activities was restored with ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, but not Ca<sup>+2</sup> or Mg<sup>+2</sup>. By contrast, ZnSO<sub>4</sub> inhibited the activities of RNases. DTT and CuSO<sub>4</sub> inhibited the activities of all three nucleases. These results suggest that activation of tuber nucleases is dependent on the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups to disulfide and/or oxidation of Zn to Zn<sup>+2</sup>. In light of previous published results that established extensive CLso-induced upregulation of oxidative stress metabolism in tubers, we propose a model to show how increased nuclease activity could result from a glutathione-mediated oxidation of nuclease sulfhydryl groups in diseased tubers. DNases and RNases are likely an integral part of the hypersensitive response and may modulate PCD to isolate the pathogen to the vascular tissues of tubers.
