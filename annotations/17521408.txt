['17521408', 'Salt imposes immediate problems for plant cells, such as osmotic stress, impaired  ion homeostasis and sodium toxicity, followed by a secondary oxidative stress  caused by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we analyzed the  production of ROS during salt stress. We show that salt stress triggered plasma  membrane internalization, resulting in the production of ROS within endosomes.  The intracellular ROS were produced by NADPH oxidase in response to the ionic but  not the osmotic stress. Both endocytosis and ROS production were suppressed in  phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase (PI3K) mutants, PI3K being a key regulator  of vesicle trafficking in animals and plants, and by wortmannin, which is a  specific inhibitor of PI3K and PI4K. Endocytosis and the production of ROS were  rescued by supplementation of seedlings with exogenous PtdIns 3-phosphate  (PtdIns3P), less with PtdIns4P, but not with PtdIns(4,5)P(2). Surprisingly,  despite reduced oxidative stress, the mutants and the wortmannin-treated plants  exhibited a phenotype overly sensitive to salt, as also resulted from treatment  with diphenyleneiodonium, a suicide inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, suggesting a  positive role for ROS in salt tolerance. In summary, our results show that salt  stress responses, such as increased plasma membrane endocytosis and the  intracellular production of ROS, are coordinated by phospholipid-regulated  signaling pathways, and suggest that ROS act in the signal transduction of the  salt tolerance response.', '2007 Jul', 'Plant J', '10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03134.x', 'Levine']
