Xylem resistance to embolism is a key metric determining plant survival during drought. Yet, we have a limited understanding of the degree of plasticity in vulnerability to embolism. Here, we tested whether light availability influences embolism resistance in leaves and stems. The optical vulnerability method was used to assess stem and leaf resistance to embolism in Phellodendron amurense and Ilex verticillata acclimated to sun and shade microenvironments within the same canopy. In both species, we found considerable segmentation in xylem resistance to embolism between leaves and stems, but only minor acclimation in response to light availability. With the addition of a third species, Betula pubescens, which shows no vulnerability segmentation, we sought to investigate xylem anatomical traits that might correlate with strong vulnerability segmentation. We found a correlation between the area fraction of vessels in the xylem and embolism resistance across species and tissue types. Our results suggest that minimal acclimation of embolism resistance occurs in response to light environment in the same individual and that the degree of vulnerability segmentation between leaves and stems might be determined by the vessel lumen fraction of the xylem.
