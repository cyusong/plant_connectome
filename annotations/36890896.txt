High concentrations of heavy metals in the environment will cause serious harm to ecosystems and human health. It is urgent to develop effective methods to control soil heavy metal pollution. Phytoremediation has advantages and potential for soil heavy metal pollution control. However, the current hyperaccumulators have the disadvantages of poor environmental adaptability, single enrichment species and small biomass. Based on the concept of modularity, synthetic biology makes it possible to design a wide range of organisms. In this paper, a comprehensive strategy of "microbial biosensor detection - phytoremediation - heavy metal recovery" for soil heavy metal pollution control was proposed, and the required steps were modified by using synthetic biology methods. This paper summarizes the new experimental methods that promote the discovery of synthetic biological elements and the construction of circuits, and combs the methods of producing transgenic plants to facilitate the transformation of constructed synthetic biological vectors. Finally, the problems that should be paid more attention to in the remediation of soil heavy metal pollution based on synthetic biology were discussed.
