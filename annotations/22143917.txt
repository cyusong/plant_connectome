['22143917', 'The light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins (LHCB) are perhaps the most  abundant membrane proteins in nature. It is reported here that the  down-regulation or disruption of any member of the LHCB family, LHCB1, LHCB2,  LHCB3, LHCB4, LHCB5, or LHCB6, reduces responsiveness of stomatal movement to  ABA, and therefore results in a decrease in plant tolerance to drought stress in  Arabidopsis thaliana. By contrast, over-expression of a LHCB member, LHCB6,  enhances stomatal sensitivity to ABA. In addition, the reactive oxygen species  (ROS) homeostasis and a set of ABA-responsive genes are altered in the lhcb  mutants. These data demonstrate that LHCBs play a positive role in guard cell  signalling in response to ABA and suggest that they may be involved in ABA  signalling partly by modulating ROS homeostasis.', '2012 Feb', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/err315', 'Zhang']
