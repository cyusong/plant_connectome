We examined the role of pathogenesis-related protein TaBWPR-1.2 in the context of molecular and physiological responses of wheat (Triticum aestivum) seminal roots under waterlogging stress. Two cDNAs corresponding to the TaBWPR-1.2 gene, TaBWPR-1.2#2 and TaBWPR-1.2#13 were cloned from seminal roots. These cDNAs were predicted to encode proteins of 173 and 172 amino acids, respectively. In a time-course experiment, TaBWPR-1.2 gene expression was highest in whole seminal roots after 1 day of waterlogging treatment and higher than the control for at least 10 days; significantly increased protein abundance was observed after 7 days of waterlogging. Drought, another abiotic stress, did not influence TaBWPR-1.2 gene expression in wheat seminal roots at 5-d-old seedlings. Tissue-specific studies revealed that the highest TaBWPR-1.2 gene expression and protein levels were in the aerenchymatous root zone. TaBWPR-1.2 expression in seminal roots was also increased by the signalling molecules 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC; an ethylene precursor), H2O2, jasmonic acid (JA), and nitric oxide (NO); however, treatment with abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), and ethanol did not alter its expression. Interestingly, aerenchyma formation in the seminal root cortex was induced only by ACC and H2O2. Taken together, these results indicate that TaBWPR-1.2 is a waterlogging-responsive gene that might be associated with root cortex tissue alteration in wheat plants through ACC and/or H2O2 regulatory mechanisms.
