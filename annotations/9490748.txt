['9490748', 'Rapid generation of O2- and H2O2, which is reminiscent of the oxidative burst in  neutrophils, is a central component of the resistance response of plants to  pathogen challenge. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis rbohA (for respiratory  burst oxidase homolog A) gene encodes a putative 108-kD protein, with a  C-terminal region that shows pronounced similarity to the 69-kD apoprotein of the  gp91phox subunit of the neutrophil respiratory burst NADPH oxidase. The RbohA  protein has a large hydrophilic N-terminal domain that is not present in  gp91phox. This domain contains two Ca2+ binding EF hand motifs and has extended  similarity to the human RanGTPase-activating protein 1. rbohA, which is a member  of a divergent gene family, generates transcripts of 3.6 and 4.0 kb that differ  only in their polyadenylation sites. rbohA transcripts are most abundant in  roots, with weaker expression in aerial organs and seedlings. Antibodies raised  against a peptide near the RbohA C terminus detected a 105-kD protein that,  unlike gp91phox, does not appear to be highly glycosylated. Cell fractionation,  two-phase partitioning, and detergent extraction indicate that RbohA is an  intrinsic plasma membrane protein. We propose that plants have a plasma membrane  enzyme similar to the neutrophil NADPH oxidase but with novel potential  regulatory mechanisms for Ca2+ and G protein stimulation of O2- and H2O2  production at the cell surface.', '1998 Feb', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.10.2.255', 'Lamb']
