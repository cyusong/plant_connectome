<i>Canavalia rosea</i> (bay bean), distributing in coastal areas or islands in tropical and subtropical regions, is an extremophile halophyte with good adaptability to seawater and drought. Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins typically accumulate in response to various abiotic stresses, including dehydration, salinity, high temperature, and cold, or during the late stage of seed development. Abscisic acid-, stress-, and ripening-induced (ASR) genes are stress and developmentally regulated plant-specific genes. In this study, we reported the first comprehensive survey of the LEA and ASR gene superfamily in <i>C. rosea</i>. A total of 84 <i>CrLEA</i>s and three <i>CrASR</i>s were identified in <i>C. rosea</i> and classified into nine groups. All CrLEAs and CrASRs harbored the conserved motif for their family proteins. Our results revealed that the <i>CrLEA</i> genes were widely distributed in different chromosomes, and all of the <i>CrLEA</i>/<i>CrASR</i> genes showed wide expression features in different tissues in <i>C. rosea</i> plants. Additionally, we introduced 10 genes from different groups into yeast to assess the functions of the <i>CrLEA</i>s/<i>CrASR</i>s. These results contribute to our understanding of <i>LEA/ASR</i> genes from halophytes and provide robust candidate genes for functional investigations in plant species adapted to extreme environments.
