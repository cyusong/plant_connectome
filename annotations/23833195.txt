Pathogen and Circadian Controlled 1 (PCC1) was previously characterized as a regulator of defence against pathogens and stress-activated transition to flowering. Plants expressing an RNA interference construct for the PCC1 gene (iPCC1 plants) showed a pleiotropic phenotype. They were hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) as shown by reduced germination potential and seedling establishment, as well as reduced stomatal aperture and main root length in ABA-supplemented media. In addition, iPCC1 plants displayed alterations in polar lipid contents and their corresponding fatty acids. Importantly, a significant reduction in the content of phosphatidylinositol (PI) was observed in iPCC1 leaves when compared with wild-type plants. A trend in reduced levels of 18:0 and increased levels of 18:2 and particularly 18:3 was also detected in several classes of polar lipids. The enhanced ABA-mediated responses and the reduced content of PI might be responsible for iPCC1 plants displaying a complex pattern of defence against pathogens of different lifestyles. iPCC1 plants were more susceptible to the hemi-biotrophic oomycete pathogen Phytophthora brassicae and more resistant to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea compared with wild-type plants.
