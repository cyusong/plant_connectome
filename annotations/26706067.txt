['26706067', 'Plant mannanases are enzymes that carry out fundamentally important functions in  cell wall metabolism during plant growth and development by digesting  manno-polysaccharides. In this work, the Arabidopsis mannanase 5-2 (AtMan5-2)  from a previously uncharacterized subclade of glycoside hydrolase family 5  subfamily 7 (GH5_7) has been heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris. Purified  recombinant AtMan5-2 is a glycosylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of  50kDa, a pH optimum of 5.5-6.0 and a temperature optimum of 25 degrees C. The enzyme  exhibits high substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency on mannan substrates  with main chains containing both glucose and mannose units such as konjac  glucomannan and spruce galactoglucomannan. Product analysis of  manno-oligosaccharide hydrolysis shows that AtMan5-2 requires at least six  substrate-binding subsites. No transglycosylation activity for the recombinant  enzyme was detected in the present study. Our results demonstrate diversification  of catalytic function among members in the Arabidopsis GH5_7 subfamily.', '2015 Dec', 'Plant Sci', '10.1016/j.plantsci.2015.10.002', 'Aspeborg']
