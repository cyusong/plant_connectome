['29878511', 'Enhancing the nutritional quality and disease resistance of crops without  sacrificing productivity is a key issue for developing varieties that are  valuable to farmers and for simultaneously improving food security and  sustainability. Expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana species-specific AtQQS  (Qua-Quine Starch) orphan gene or its interactor, NF-YC4 (Nuclear Factor Y,  subunit C4), has been shown to increase levels of leaf/seed protein without  affecting the growth and yield of agronomic species. Here, we demonstrate that  overexpression of AtQQS and NF-YC4 in Arabidopsis and soybean enhances  resistance/reduces susceptibility to viruses, bacteria, fungi, aphids and soybean  cyst nematodes. A series of Arabidopsis mutants in starch metabolism were used to  explore the relationships between QQS expression, carbon and nitrogen  partitioning, and defense. The enhanced basal defenses mediated by QQS were  independent of changes in protein/carbohydrate composition of the plants. We  demonstrate that either AtQQS or NF-YC4 overexpression in Arabidopsis and in  soybean reduces susceptibility of these plants to pathogens/pests. Transgenic  soybean lines overexpressing NF-YC4 produce seeds with increased protein while  maintaining healthy growth. Pull-down studies reveal that QQS interacts with  human NF-YC, as well as with Arabidopsis NF-YC4, and indicate two QQS binding  sites near the NF-YC-histone-binding domain. A new model for QQS interaction with  NF-YC is speculated. Our findings illustrate the potential of QQS and NF-YC4 to  increase protein and improve defensive traits in crops, overcoming the normal  growth-defense trade-offs.', '2019 Jan', 'Plant Biotechnol J', '10.1111/pbi.12961', 'ORCID:']
