Since the completion of the rice genome sequencing project in 2005, we have entered the era of rice genomics, which is still in its ascendancy. Rice genomics studies can be classified into three stages: structural genomics, functional genomics, and quantitative genomics. Structural genomics refers primarily to genome sequencing for the construction of a complete map of rice genome sequence. This is fundamental for rice genetics and molecular biology research. Functional genomics aims to decode the functions of rice genes. Quantitative genomics is large-scale sequence- and statistics-based research to define the quantitative traits and genetic features of rice populations. Rice genomics has been a transformative influence on rice biological research and contributes significantly to rice breeding, making rice a good model plant for studying crop sciences.
