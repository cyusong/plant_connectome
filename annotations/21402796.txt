['21402796', 'Exposure of the mature Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed to water results  in the rapid release of pectinaceous mucilage from the outer cells of the testa.  Once released, mucilage completely envelops the seed in a gel-like capsule. The  physical force required to rupture the outer cell wall of the testa comes from  the swelling of the mucilage as it expands rapidly following hydration. In this  study, we show that mutations in the transcriptional regulator LEUNIG_HOMOLOG  (LUH) cause a mucilage extrusion defect due to altered mucilage swelling. Based  on sugar linkage and immunomicroscopic analyses, we show that the structure of  luh mucilage is altered, having both an increase in substituted  rhamnogalacturonan I and in methyl-esterified homogalacturonan. Also correlated  with the structural modification of luh mucilage is a significant decrease in  MUCILAGE MODIFIED2 (MUM2; a beta-galactosidase) expression in the luh seed coat,  raising the possibility that reduced activity of this glycosidase is directly  responsible for the luh mucilage defects. Consistent with this is the structural  similarity between mum2 and luh mucilage as well as the observation that  elevating MUM2 expression in luh mutants completely suppresses the mucilage  extrusion defect. Suppression of the luh mutant phenotype was also observed when  LEUNIG, a transcriptional corepressor closely related to LUH, was introduced in  luh mutants under the control of the LUH promoter. Based on these data, we  propose a new model for the regulation of pectin biosynthesis during plant growth  and development.', '2011 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.111.172692', 'Golz']
