['15024409', 'Multicellular eukaryotes produce small RNA molecules (approximately 21-24  nucleotides) of two general types, microRNA (miRNA) and short interfering RNA  (siRNA). They collectively function as sequence-specific guides to silence or  regulate genes, transposons, and viruses and to modify chromatin and genome  structure. Formation or activity of small RNAs requires factors belonging to gene  families that encode DICER (or DICER-LIKE [DCL]) and ARGONAUTE proteins and, in  the case of some siRNAs, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) proteins. Unlike many  animals, plants encode multiple DCL and RDR proteins. Using a series of insertion  mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana, unique functions for three DCL proteins in miRNA  (DCL1), endogenous siRNA (DCL3), and viral siRNA (DCL2) biogenesis were  identified. One RDR protein (RDR2) was required for all endogenous siRNAs  analyzed. The loss of endogenous siRNA in dcl3 and rdr2 mutants was associated  with loss of heterochromatic marks and increased transcript accumulation at some  loci. Defects in siRNA-generation activity in response to turnip crinkle virus in  dcl2 mutant plants correlated with increased virus susceptibility. We conclude  that proliferation and diversification of DCL and RDR genes during evolution of  plants contributed to specialization of small RNA-directed pathways for  development, chromatin structure, and defense.', '2004 May', 'PLoS Biol', '10.1371/journal.pbio.0020104', 'Carrington']
