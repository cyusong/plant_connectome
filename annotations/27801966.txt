The rapid development of omics sequencing technology has facilitated the identification of thousands of long non-coding (lnc)RNAs in plant species, but the role of lncRNAs in plant-pathogen interactions remains largely unexplored. We used comparative transcriptome analysis of Phytophthora infestans-resistant and -susceptible tomatoes to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and lncRNAs (DELs), and examine lncRNA-mRNA networks. A total of 1037 DEGs and 688 DELs were identified between P.말nfestans-resistant and -susceptible tomatoes. The co-localization networks, including 128 DEGs and 127 DELs, were performed. We found that lncRNA16397 acted as an antisense transcript of SlGRX22 to regulate its expression, and also induced SlGRX21 expression when lncRNA16397 was overexpressed. In addition, disease symptoms and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in tomatoes overexpressing lncRNA16397 and SpGRX were fewer and lower than those in wild-type after P.말nfestans infection. This result suggests that tomato lncRNA16397 induces SlGRX expression to reduce ROS accumulation and alleviate cell membrane injury, resulting in enhanced resistance to P.말nfestans. Our results provide insight into lncRNAs involved in the response of tomato to P.말nfestans infection, demonstrate that the lncRNA16397-GRXs network is an important component of the P.말nfestans network in tomato, and provide candidates for breeding to enhance biotic stress-resistance in tomato.
