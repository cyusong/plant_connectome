Leaves are derived from the shoot apical meristem with three distinct axes: dorsoventral, proximodistal and mediolateral. Different regulators are involved in the establishment of leaf polarity. Members of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIPIII) gene family are critical players in the determination of leaf adaxial identity mediated by microRNA165/166. However, their roles in compound leaf development are still unclear. By screening of a retrotransposon-tagged mutant population of the model legume plant Medicago truncatula, a mutant line with altered leaflet numbers was isolated and characterized. Mutant leaves partially lost their adaxial identity. Leaflet numbers in the mutant were increased along the proximodistal axis, showing pinnate pentafoliate leaves in most cases, in contrast to the trifoliate leaves of the wild type. Detailed characterization revealed that a lesion in a HD-ZIPIII gene, REVOLUTA (MtREV1), resulted in the defects of the mutant. Overexpression of MtMIR166-insensitive MtREV1 led to adaxialized leaves and ectopic leaflets along the dorsoventral axis. Accompanying the abnormal leaf patterning, the free auxin content was affected. Our results demonstrate that MtREV1 plays a key role in determination of leaf adaxial-abaxial polarity and compound leaf patterning, which is associated with proper auxin homeostasis.
