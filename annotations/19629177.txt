['19629177', 'Plant Resistance (R) proteins play an integral role in defense against pathogen  infection. A unique gain-of-function mutation in the R gene SNC1, snc1, results  in constitutive activation of plant immune pathways and enhanced resistance  against pathogen infection. We previously found that mutations in MOS4 suppress  the autoimmune phenotypes of snc1, and that MOS4 is part of a nuclear complex  called the MOS4-Associated Complex (MAC) along with the transcription factor  AtCDC5 and the WD-40 protein PRL1. Here we report the immuno-affinity  purification of the MAC using HA-tagged MOS4 followed by protein sequence  analysis by mass spectrometry. A total of 24 MAC proteins were identified, 19 of  which have predicted roles in RNA processing based on their homology to proteins  in the Prp19-Complex, an evolutionarily conserved spliceosome-associated complex  containing homologs of MOS4, AtCDC5, and PRL1. Among these were two highly  similar U-box proteins with homology to the yeast and human E3 ubiquitin ligase  Prp19, which we named MAC3A and MAC3B. MAC3B was recently shown to exhibit E3  ligase activity in vitro. Through reverse genetics analysis we show that MAC3A  and MAC3B are functionally redundant and are required for basal and R  protein-mediated resistance in Arabidopsis. Like mos4-1 and Atcdc5-1, mac3a mac3b  suppresses snc1-mediated autoimmunity. MAC3 localizes to the nucleus and  interacts with AtCDC5 in planta. Our results suggest that MAC3A and MAC3B are  members of the MAC that function redundantly in the regulation of plant innate  immunity.', '2009 Jul', 'PLoS Pathog', '10.1371/journal.ppat.1000526', 'Li']
