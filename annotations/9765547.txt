['9765547', 'High fluence-rate blue light (BL) rapidly inhibits hypocotyl growth in  Arabidopsis, as in other species, after a lag time of 30 s. This growth  inhibition is always preceded by the activation of anion channels. The membrane  depolarization that results from the activation of anion channels by BL was only  30% of the wild-type magnitude in hy4, a mutant lacking the HY4 BL receptor.  High-resolution measurements of growth made with a computer-linked displacement  transducer or digitized images revealed that BL caused a rapid inhibition of  growth in wild-type and hy4 seedlings. This inhibition persisted in wild-type  seedlings during more than 40 h of continuous BL. By contrast, hy4 escaped from  the initial inhibition after approximately 1 h of BL and grew faster than wild  type for approximately 30 h. Wild-type seedlings treated with  5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid, a potent blocker of the  BL-activated anion channel, displayed rapid growth inhibition, but, similar to  hy4, these seedlings escaped from inhibition after approximately 1 h of BL and  phenocopied the mutant for at least 2.5 h. The effects of  5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid and the HY4 mutation were not  additive. Taken together, the results indicate that BL acts through HY4 to  activate anion channels at the plasma membrane, causing growth inhibition that  begins after approximately 1 h. Neither HY4 nor anion channels appear to  participate greatly in the initial phase of inhibition.', '1998 Oct', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.118.2.609', 'Spalding']
