['24129639', 'The plant hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) has a crucial role in plant  development. Its spatiotemporal distribution is controlled by a combination of  biosynthetic, metabolic and transport mechanisms. Four families of auxin  transporters have been identified that mediate transport across the plasma or  endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Here we report the discovery and the functional  characterization of the first vacuolar auxin transporter. We demonstrate that  WALLS ARE THIN1 (WAT1), a plant-specific protein that dictates secondary cell  wall thickness of wood fibres, facilitates auxin export from isolated Arabidopsis  vacuoles in yeast and in Xenopus oocytes. We unambiguously identify IAA and  related metabolites in isolated Arabidopsis vacuoles, suggesting a key role for  the vacuole in intracellular auxin homoeostasis. Moreover, local auxin  application onto wat1 mutant stems restores fibre cell wall thickness. Our study  provides new insight into the complexity of auxin transport in plants and a means  to dissect auxin function during fibre differentiation.', '2013', 'Nat Commun', '10.1038/ncomms3625', 'Goffner']
