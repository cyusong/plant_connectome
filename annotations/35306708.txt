In seed plants, phospho-base N-methyltransferase (PMT) catalyzes a key step in the biosynthesis pathway of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most abundant phospholipid class. Arabidopsis thaliana possesses three copies of PMT, with PMT1 and PMT3 play a primary role because the pmt1 pmt3 double mutant shows considerably reduced PC content with a pale seedling phenotype. Although the function of PMT1 and PMT3 may be redundant because neither of the parental single mutants showed a similar mutant phenotype, major developmental defects and possible functional divergence of these PMTs underlying the pale pmt1 pmt3 seedling phenotype are unknown. Here, we show the major developmental defect of the pale seedlings in xylem of the hypocotyl with partial impairments in chloroplast development and photosynthetic activity in leaves. Although PMT1 and PMT3 are localized at the endoplasmic reticulum, their tissue-specific expression pattern was distinct in hypocotyls and roots. Intriguingly, the function of PMT3 but not PMT1 requires its characteristic N-terminal sequence in addition to the promoter because truncation of the N-terminal sequence of PMT3 or substitution with PMT1 driven by the PMT3 promoter failed to rescue the pale pmt1 pmt3 seedling phenotype. Thus, PMT3 function requires the N-terminal sequence in addition to its promoter, whereas the PMT1 function is defined by the promoter.
