New genes often drive the evolution of gene interaction networks. In Brassica napus, the widely used genic male sterile breeding system 7365ABC is controlled by two young genes, Bnams4<sup>b</sup> and BnaMs3. However, the interaction mechanism of these two young genes remains unclear. Here, we confirmed that Bnams4<sup>b</sup> interacts with the nuclear localised E3 ligase BRUTUS (BTS). Ectopic expression of AtBRUTUS (AtBTS) and comparison between Bnams4<sup>b</sup> -transgenic Arabidopsis and bts mutants suggested that Bnams4<sup>b</sup> may drive translocation of BTS to cause various toxic defects. BnaMs3 gained an exclusive interaction with the plastid outer-membrane translocon Toc33 compared with Bnams3 and AtTic40, and specifically compensated for the toxic effects of Bnams4<sup>b</sup> . Heat shock treatment also rescued the sterile phenotype, and high temperature suppressed the interaction between Bnams4<sup>b</sup> and BTS in yeast. Furthermore, the ubiquitin system and TOC (translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts) component accumulation were affected in Bnams4<sup>b</sup> -transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Taken together, these results indicate that new chimeric Bnams4<sup>b</sup> carries BTS from nucleus to chloroplast, which may disrupt the normal ubiquitin-proteasome system to cause toxic effects, and these defects can be compensated by BnaMs3-Toc33 interaction or environmental heat shock. It reveals a scenario in which two population-specific coevolved young genes reshape a novel interaction network in plants.
