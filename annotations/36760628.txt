Most of the water quality indicators that affect the results of river water quality assessment are gray and localized, thus the correlation between water quality indicators can be calculated using gray correlation analysis (GRA).However, GRA takes equal weighting for water quality indicators and does not take into account the weighting of the indicators. Therefore, this paper proposes a river water quality assessment method based on improved grey correlation analysis (ACGRA) andparticle swarm optimization multi-classification support vector machine (PSO-MSVM) for assessing river water environment quality. Firstly, the combination weights of water quality indicators were calculated using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)AHP and Criteria Importance Though Intercrieria Correlation (CRITIC)CRITIC, and then the correlation between water quality indicators was calculated for feature selection. Secondly, the PSO-MSVM model was established using the water quality indicators obtained by ACGRA as input parameters for water environment quality assessment. The river water environment assessment methods of ACGRA and PSO-MSVM were applied to the evaluation of water environment quality in different watersheds in the country. Accuracy, precision, recall and root mean square errorRMSE were also introduced as model evaluation criteria. The results show that the river water environment assessment methods based on ACGRA and PSO-MSVM can evaluate the water environment quality more accurately.
