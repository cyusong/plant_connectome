The root-knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola is an obligate biotrophic parasite and a major pest of rice (Oryza sativa) for which resistant varieties are not currently available. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for partial resistance to M. graminicola were identified using a mapping population based on two rice varieties, Bala x Azucena. Experiments were carried out to investigate the interactions between M. graminicola and these two varieties in terms of nematode establishment, reproduction and effect on rice yield. Nematode establishment was also assessed in the mapping population. Meloidogyne graminicola consistently caused more galling and had higher reproductive success in Azucena than in Bala. M. graminicola did not significantly reduce yield in Bala, but caused a yield reduction of almost half in Azucena, suggesting that the partial resistance to nematode establishment was related to nematode tolerance. A total of six significant or putative QTLs for nematode tolerance were detected. For two of the QTLs detected, Azucena was the donor of the tolerance alleles, suggesting it may be possible to breed plants with greater tolerance than Bala.
