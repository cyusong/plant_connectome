['27455172', 'Protein farnesylation is a post-translational modification involving the addition  of a 15-carbon farnesyl isoprenoid to the carboxy terminus of select  proteins(1-3). Although the roles of this lipid modification are clear in both  fungal and animal signalling, many of the mechanistic functions of farnesylation  in plant signalling are still unknown. Here, we show that CYP85A2, the cytochrome  P450 enzyme that performs the last step in brassinosteroid biosynthesis  (conversion of castasterone to brassinolide)(4), must be farnesylated to function  in Arabidopsis. Loss of either CYP85A2 or CYP85A2 farnesylation results in  reduced brassinolide accumulation and increased plant responsiveness to the  hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and overall drought tolerance, explaining previous  observations(5). This result not only directly links farnesylation to  brassinosteroid biosynthesis but also suggests new strategies to maintain crop  yield under challenging climatic conditions.', '2016 Jul 25', 'Nat Plants', '10.1038/nplants.2016.114', 'ORCID:']
