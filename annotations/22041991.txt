Recently, we reported the role of Arabidopsis cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel (AtCNGC) 11 and 12 in Ca2+-dependent physiological responses. AtCNGC11 and 12 have been reported to be involved in plant immunity, but whether these channels play additional physiological roles was not clear before. Using single and double knockout mutants, we have found that these channels play significant roles in Ca2+ signaling, which mediates several physiological processes, such as gravitropic bending and senescence. Here, we conducted a high throughput, non-biased chemical screen using the gain-of-function mutant of AtCNGC11 and 12, cpr22. Our data presented here indicates that Ca2+ but not K+ channel blockers suppress AtCNGC11/12-induced lethality. Our data further suggest that AtCNGC11 and 12 are involved in Ca2+-dependent, but not K+-dependent physiological responses in planta.

AtCNGC11: !mediates! Ca2+ signaling 
Ca2+ signaling: !affects! physiological processes 
AtCNGC11/12: !induces! lethality 
Ca2+ channel blockers: !suppress! AtCNGC11/12-induced lethality 
K+ channel blockers: !do not suppress! AtCNGC11/12-induced lethality
