DNA replication is a fundamental process for the faithful transmission of genetic information in all living organisms. Many endogenous and environmental signals impede fork progression during DNA synthesis, which induces replication errors and DNA replication stress. Chromatin remodeling factors regulate nucleosome occupancy and the histone composition of the nucleosome in chromatin; however, whether chromatin remodeling factors are involved in the DNA replication stress response in plants is unknown. We reveal that chromatin remodeling factor CHR18 plays important roles in DNA replication stress in Arabidopsis thaliana by interacting with the DNA replication protein RPA1A. According to the genetic analysis, the loss of function of either CHR18 or RPA1A confers a high sensitivity to DNA replication stress in Arabidopsis. CHR18 interacts with RPA1A in both yeast cells and tobacco epidermal cells. The coexpression of RPA1A and CHR18 enhances the accumulation of CHR18 in nuclear foci in plants. CHR18 is a typical nuclear-localized chromatin remodeling factor with ATPase activity. Our results demonstrate that during DNA synthesis in plants, RPA1A interacts with CHR18 and recruits CHR18 to nuclear foci to resolve DNA replication stress, which is important for cell propagation and root growth in Arabidopsis plants.
