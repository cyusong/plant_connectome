Pollen development, pollen grain germination, and pollen tube elongation are crucial biological processes in angiosperm plants that need precise regulation to deliver sperm cells to ovules for fertilization. Highly polarized secretion at a growing pollen tube tip requires the exocyst tethering complex responsible for specific targeting of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) EXO70A2 (At5g52340) is the main exocyst EXO70 isoform in the male gametophyte, governing the conventional secretory function of the exocyst, analogous to EXO70A1 (At5g03540) in the sporophyte. Our analysis of a CRISPR-generated <i>exo70a2</i> mutant revealed that EXO70A2 is essential for efficient pollen maturation, pollen grain germination, and pollen tube growth. GFP:EXO70A2 was localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm in developing pollen grains and later to the apical domain in growing pollen tube tips characterized by intensive exocytosis. Moreover, EXO70A2 could substitute for EXO70A1 function in the sporophyte, but not vice versa, indicating partial functional redundancy of these two closely related isoforms and higher specificity of EXO70A2 for pollen development-related processes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ancient duplication of EXO70A, one of which is always highly expressed in pollen, occurred independently in monocots and dicots. In summary, EXO70A2 is a crucial component of the exocyst complex in Arabidopsis pollen that is required for efficient plant sexual reproduction.
