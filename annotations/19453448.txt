In higher plants a number of physiological processes are regulated by systemic RNA signaling molecules. This phloem-mediated remote-control system provides specific and efficient regulation to fine-tune many plant developmental programs. However, the molecular mechanism underlying long-distance movement of RNA remains to be elucidated. To this end, we examined the long-distance movement of GA-insensitive (GAI) RNA by Arabidopsis inflorescence grafting and RT-PCR analysis. Our results demonstrated that long-distance movement of RNA only occurred in specific transcripts. In addition, the sequences of GAI RNA are necessary and sufficient to target GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (GFP) RNA for long-distance movement, which indicates that the trafficking of GAI RNA is mediated by specific RNA motifs. Further analyses revealed that the motifs at coding sequences and 3' untranslated regions of GAI RNA play important roles during RNA movement. In addition, the structure of the RNA rather than its specific sequence may also be important in GAI RNA trafficking. However, the secondary structure of GAI RNA is not the only factor to target RNA for long-distance movement, because recovery of the secondary structure of movement-defective GAI RNA only partially rescued RNA movement. Taken together, our results show that long-distance movement of non-cell autonomous RNA operates by specific RNA mobile elements.
