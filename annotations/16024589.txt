['16024589', 'In this study, we characterize the evolutionarily conserved TOUGH (TGH) protein  as a novel regulator required for Arabidopsis thaliana development. We initially  identified TGH as a yeast two-hybrid system interactor of the transcription  initiation factor TATA-box binding protein 2. TGH has apparent orthologs in all  eukaryotic model organisms with the exception of the budding yeast Saccharomyces  cerevisiae. TGH contains domains with strong similarity to G-patch and SWAP  domains, protein domains that are characteristic of RNA binding and processing  proteins. Furthermore, TGH colocalizes with the splicing regulator SRp34 to  subnuclear particles. We therefore propose that TGH plays a role in RNA binding  or processing. Arabidopsis tgh mutants display developmental defects, including  reduced plant height, polycotyly, and reduced vascularization. We found TGH  expression to be increased in the amp1-1 mutant, which is similar to tgh mutants  with respect to polycotyly and defects in vascular development. Interestingly, we  observed a strong genetic interaction between TGH and AMP1 in that tgh-1 amp1-1  double mutants are extremely dwarfed and severely affected in plant development  in general and vascular development in particular when compared with the single  mutants.', '2005 Sep', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.105.031302', 'Schwechheimer']
