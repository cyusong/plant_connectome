Recent developments in both instrumentation and image analysis algorithms have allowed three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D-EM) to increase automated image collections through large tissue volumes using serial block-face scanning EM (SEM) and to achieve near-atomic resolution of macromolecular complexes using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and sub-tomogram averaging. In this review, we discuss applications of cryo-ET to cell biology research on plant and algal systems and the special opportunities they offer for understanding the organization of eukaryotic organelles with unprecedently resolution. However, one of the most challenging aspects for cryo-ET is sample preparation, especially for multicellular organisms. We also discuss correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) approaches that have been developed for ET at both room and cryogenic temperatures.
