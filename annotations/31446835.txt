There is a scarcity of research reports on the effect of ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation on genome-wide transcriptional regulation in the multicellular green microalga including <i>Volvox carteri</i> (<i>V. carteri</i>). This microalga possesses only two cell types including mortal and motile somatic cells, as well as immortal and immotile reproductive cells. Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of low-dose UV-B radiation on the cell-type-specific gene expression pattern of reproductive and somatic cells in an asexual life cycle of <i>V. carteri</i> using RNA sequence method. To this end, the separated reproductive and somatic cells were treated for 1 hour at an intensity of 0.056 mW/cm<sup>-2</sup> UV-B radiation. Then, a transcriptome analysis was conducted between the UV-B and white light treated groups in either of the cell types. Based on differential gene expression analyses, no differentially expressed genes were found in reproductive cells under the treatment as compared to the control group. This type of cell maintained its steady state. However, treating the somatic cells with UV-B radiation led to at least 126 differentially expressed genes compared to the untreated control group. In addition, the results of a direct comparison demonstrated a restricted and wide response to UV-B radiation in somatic cells as compared to reproductive cells. Based on the results, UV-B radiation could be involved in cell-type-specific regulation of biological pathways.
