Functional genomics can be applied to shed light on the <i>Brassica napus</i> - Verticillium interaction. RNAseq data indicated already that abscisic acid (ABA) is apparently involved in the early oilseed rape response to fungal infection with <i>Verticillium longisporum</i> isolate 43 (<i>Vl43</i>). A calreticulin (CRT1a) was identified as novel susceptibility factor for <i>Vl43</i> infecting both Arabidopsis and oilseed rape. CRT1a is involved in calcium homeostasis and contributes in the endoplasmatic reticulum to the unfolded protein response. The latter function could either affect the correct folding of other susceptibility factors or of negative regulators in ethylene (ET) signaling. Which CRT1a function is affected in the mutants is currently unknown, but both hypotheses can explain that <i>crt1a</i> loss-of-function mutants display increased resistance to <i>V. longisporum</i> and enhanced expression of ethylene signaling related genes. This indicates that besides other phytohormones such as ABA or salicylic acid (SA) also ET plays a critical role in the plant-Verticillium interaction, which might be exploited to improve plant resistance.
