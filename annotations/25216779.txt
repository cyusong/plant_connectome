['25216779', 'BACKGROUND: HSP90.5 is a chloroplast localized HSP90 family molecular chaperone  in Arabidopsis, and it has been implicated in plant abiotic stress resistance,  photomorphogenesis and nuclear-encoded protein import into the chloroplast.  However, how these processes are controlled by HSP90 is not well understood. To  understand the role of HSP90.5 in chloroplast function and biogenesis, in this  study, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress a C-terminally  FLAG-tagged HSP90.5. By characterizing three HSP90.5 cosuppression lines, we  demonstrated the essential role of HSP90.5 in plant growth and chloroplast  biogenesis. RESULTS: Immunoblotting and quantitative PCR analyses revealed three  independent HSP90.5 cosuppressing transgenic lines. All three cosuppression lines  displayed a certain degree of variegated phenotype in photosynthetic tissues, and  the cosuppression did not affect the expression of cytosolic HSP90 isoforms.  HSP90.5 cosuppression was shown to be developmentally regulated and occurred  mostly at late developmental stage in adult leaves and inflorescence tissues.  HSP90.5 cosuppression also caused significantly reduced rosette leaf growth,  transient starch storage, but did not affect rosette leaf initiation or  inflorescence production, although the fertility was reduced. Isolation of  chloroplasts and size exclusion chromatography analysis indicated that the FLAG  at the HSP90.5 C-terminus does not affect its proper chloroplast localization and  dimerization. Finally, transmission electron microscopy indicated that  chloroplast development in HSP90.5 cosuppression leaves was significantly  impaired and the integrity of chloroplast is highly correlated to the expression  level of HSP90.5. CONCLUSION: We thoroughly characterized three HSP90.5  cosuppression lines, and demonstrated that properly controlled expression of  HSP90.5 is required for plant growth and development in many tissues, and  especially essential for chloroplast thylakoid formation. Since the homozygote of  HSP90.5 knockout mutant is embryonically lethal, this study provides transgenic  lines that mimic the conditional knockout line or siRNA line of the essential  HSP90.5 gene in Arabidopsis.', '2014 Sep 13', 'BMC Res Notes', '10.1186/1756-0500-7-643', 'Zhao']
