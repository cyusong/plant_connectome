['25056921', 'Contrasting with the wealth of information available on the multiple roles of  jasmonates in plant development and defense, knowledge about the functions and  the biosynthesis of hydroxylated oxylipins remains scarce. By expressing the  caleosin RESPONSIVE TO DESSICATION20 (RD20) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show  that the recombinant protein possesses an unusual peroxygenase activity with  restricted specificity toward hydroperoxides of unsaturated fatty acid.  Accordingly, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants overexpressing RD20  accumulate the product 13-hydroxy-9,11,15-octadecatrienoic acid, a  linolenate-derived hydroxide. These plants exhibit elevated levels of reactive  oxygen species (ROS) associated with early gibberellin-dependent flowering and  abscisic acid hypersensitivity at seed germination. These phenotypes are  dependent on the presence of active RD20, since they are abolished in the rd20  null mutant and in lines overexpressing RD20, in which peroxygenase was  inactivated by a point mutation of a catalytic histidine residue. RD20 also  confers tolerance against stress induced by Paraquat, Rose Bengal, heavy metal,  and the synthetic auxins 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic  acid. Under oxidative stress, 13-hydroxy-9,11,15-octadecatrienoic acid still  accumulates in RD20-overexpressing lines, but this lipid oxidation is associated  with reduced ROS levels, minor cell death, and delayed floral transition. A model  is discussed where the interplay between fatty acid hydroxides generated by RD20  and ROS is counteracted by ethylene during development in unstressed  environments.', '2014 Sep', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.245316', 'Bessoule']
