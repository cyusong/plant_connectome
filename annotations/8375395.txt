['8375395', 'A full-length cDNA clone for a novel glutathione S-transferase was isolated from  Arabidopsis thaliana and characterized. The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 218  amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 24,363 Da. The sequence was most  related to the theta class within the glutathione-S-transferase superfamily of  enzymes. The protein encoded by the cDNA was functionally expressed and  enzymically active in Escherichia coli; glutathione-S-transferase activity with  the standard enzyme substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was demonstrated  (apparent Km, 10 mM; apparent Km for glutathione, 0.08 mM). The enzyme is  substrate specific and did not use several electrophilic reduced-glutathione  acceptor molecules for conjugation. However, it efficiently catalyzed the  conversion of 13-hydroperoxy-9,11,15-octadecatrienoic acid (Km, 0.67 mM) as well  as 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (Km, 0.79 mM) to the corresponding  hydroxy derivatives with concomitant formation of oxidized glutathione. The  enzyme did not use H2O2 as substrate. Thus, the cloned A. thaliana enzyme  functions as glutathione peroxidase and, in the plant cell, may be involved in  the removal of reactive organic hydroperoxides, such as the products of lipid  peroxidation. The enzyme is structurally and enzymatically, however, unrelated to  the selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases. Enzymic and immunoblotting data  suggest that the A. thaliana enzyme is soluble and constitutively expressed in  vegetative rosettes, but is under developmental control during the transition to  bolting and flowering.', '1993 Sep 1', 'Eur J Biochem', '10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18177.x', 'Weiler']
