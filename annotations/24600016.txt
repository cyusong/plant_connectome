Fruit ripening is a complex, genetically programmed process that occurs in conjunction with the differentiation of chloroplasts into chromoplasts and involves changes to the organoleptic properties of the fruit. In this study, an integrative analysis of the transcriptome and proteome was performed to identify important regulators and pathways involved in fruit ripening in a spontaneous late-ripening mutant ('Fengwan' orange, Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) and its wild type ('Fengjie 72-1'). At the transcript level, 628 genes showed a 2-fold or more expression difference between the mutant and wild type as detected by an RNA sequencing approach. At the protein level, 130 proteins differed by 1.5-fold or more in their relative abundance, as indicated by iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) analysis. A comparison of the transcriptome and proteome data revealed some aspects of the regulation of metabolism during orange fruit ripening. First, a large number of differential genes were found to belong to the plant hormone pathways and cell-wall-related metabolism. Secondly, we noted a correlation between ripening-associated transcripts and sugar metabolites, which suggests the importance of these metabolic pathways during fruit ripening. Thirdly, a number of genes showed inconsistency between the transcript and protein level, which is indicative of post-transcriptional events. These results reveal multiple ripening-associated events during citrus ripening and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying citrus ripening regulatory networks.
