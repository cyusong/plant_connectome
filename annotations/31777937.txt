['31777937', "Modifications at the 5'-end of RNAs play a pivotal role in determining their  fate. In eukaryotes, the DXO/Rai1 family of enzymes removes numerous 5'-end RNA  modifications, thereby regulating RNA turnover. Mouse DXO catalyzes the  elimination of incomplete 5'-end caps (including pyrophosphate) and the  non-canonical NAD+ cap on mRNAs, and possesses distributive 5'-3' exoribonuclease  activity toward 5'-monophosphate (5'-PO4) RNA. Here, we demonstrate that DXO also  catalyzes the hydrolysis of RNAs bearing a 5'-hydroxyl group (5'-OH RNA). The  crystal structure of DXO in complex with a 5'-OH RNA substrate mimic at 2.0 A  resolution provides elegant insight into the molecular mechanism of this  activity. More importantly, the structure predicts that DXO first removes a  dinucleotide from 5'-OH RNA. Our nuclease assays confirm this prediction and  demonstrate that this 5'-hydroxyl dinucleotide hydrolase (HDH) activity for DXO  is higher than the subsequent 5'-3' exoribonuclease activity for selected  substrates. Fission yeast Rai1 also has HDH activity although it does not have  5'-3' exonuclease activity, and the Rat1-Rai1 complex can completely degrade  5'-OH RNA. An Arabidopsis DXO1 variant is active toward 5'-OH RNA but prefers  5'-PO4 RNA. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the diverse activities of  DXO/Rai1 and expands the collection of RNA substrates that can undergo 5'-3'  mediated decay.", '2020 Jan 10', 'Nucleic Acids Res', '10.1093/nar/gkz1107', 'Tong']
