GmGASA is the GASA gibberellin regulated cysteine-rich protein family. The expression of GmGASA is up-regulated by gibberellin, which is the longest plant hormone in plants playing vital roles in plant development. However, very few reports explaining the direct regulation of downstream genes by <i>GASA gene</i> are available. In the current study, the <i>GmGASA32</i>, a member of the <i>GASA</i> family affecting soybean height was identified. In the early stage, preliminary verification of the response of <i>GmGASA32</i> to gibberellin through phenotypic experiment was done. The promoter activity analysis confirmed that <i>GmGASA32</i> was induced by gibberellin. Subcellular localization showed that GmGASA32-GFP fusion protein enriched in the nucleus after gibberellin treatment. In order to confirm the function of GmGASA32 in the nucleus, we confirmed that the GASA domain in the C terminal of GmGASA32 can interact with GmCDC25 (cell cycle-associated protein) through the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay.
