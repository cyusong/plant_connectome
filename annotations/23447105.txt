In flowering plants, pollen development is a highly programmed process, in which a lot of genes are involved. In this study, a gene, designated as GhMYB24, encoding R2R3-MYB-like protein was isolated from cotton. GhMYB24 protein is localized in the cell nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator. Northern blot analysis revealed that GhMYB24 transcripts were predominantly detected in anthers. It was further found that strong expression of GhMYB24 was mainly detected in pollen and was regulated during anther development by in situ hybridization. Overexpression of GhMYB24 in Arabidopsis caused flower malformation, shorter filaments, non-dehiscent anthers and fewer viable pollen grains. Further analysis revealed that the septum and stomium cells of anthers were not broken, and fewer fibrous bands were found in the endothecium cells in transgenic plants. A complementation test demonstrated that GhMYB24 was able to recover partially the male fertility of the myb21 myb24 double mutant. Expression levels of the genes involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway and reactive oxygen species homeostasis were altered in GhMYB24-overexpressing transgenic plants. Furthermore, the genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis and its signaling pathway were up-regulated in the transgenic plants. Yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that GhMYB24 interacted with GhJAZ1/2 in cells. Taking the data together, our results suggest that GhMYB24 may play an important role in normal anther/pollen development.
