Tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> L.) seed lipid is a promising non-edible feedstock for biodiesel production. In order to meet the increasing demand, achieving high seed lipid content is one of the major goals in tobacco seed production. The <i>TT8</i> gene and its homologs negatively regulate seed lipid accumulation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Brassica</i> species. We speculated that manipulating the homolog genes of <i>TT8</i> in tobacco could enhance the accumulation of seed lipid. In this present study, we found that the <i>TT8</i> homolog genes in tobacco, <i>NtAn1a</i> and <i>NtAn1b</i>, were highly expressed in developing seed. Targeted mutagenesis of <i>NtAn1</i> genes was created by the CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing technology. Due to the defect of proanthocyanidin (PA) biosynthesis, mutant seeds showed the phenotype of a yellow seed coat. Seed lipid accumulation was enhanced by about 18 and 15% in two targeted mutant lines. Protein content was also significantly increased in mutant seeds. In addition, the seed yield-related traits were not affected by the targeted mutagenesis of <i>NtAn1</i> genes. Thus, the overall lipid productivity of the <i>NtAn1</i> knockout mutants was dramatically enhanced. The results in this present paper indicated that tobacco <i>NtAn1</i> genes regulate both PAs and lipid accumulation in the process of seed development and that targeted mutagenesis of <i>NtAn1</i> genes could generate a yellow-seeded tobacco variety with high lipid and protein content. Furthermore, the present results revealed that the CRISPR-Cas9 system could be employed in tobacco seed <i>de novo</i> domestication for biodiesel feedstock production.
