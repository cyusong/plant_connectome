Hfq is a RNA chaperone and participates in a wide range of cellular processes and pathways. In this study, mutation of hfq gene from Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum PccS1 led to significantly reduced virulence and plant cell wall-degrading enzyme (PCWDE) activities. In addition, the mutant exhibited decreased biofilm formation and motility and greatly attenuated carbapenem production as well as secretion of hemolysin coregulated protein (Hcp) as compared with wild-type strain PccS1. Moreover, a higher level of callose deposition was induced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves when infiltrated with the mutant. A total of 26 small (s)RNA deletion mutants were obtained among a predicted 27 sRNAs, and three mutants exhibited reduced virulence in the host plant. These results suggest that hfq plays a key role in Pectobacterium virulence by positively impacting PCWDE production, secretion of the type VI secretion system, bacterial competition, and suppression of host plant responses.
