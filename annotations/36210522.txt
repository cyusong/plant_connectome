Lipid membrane destruction by microbial pore-forming toxins (PFTs) is a ubiquitous mechanism of damage to animal cells, but is less prominent in plants. Nep1-like proteins (NLPs) secreted by phytopathogens that cause devastating crop diseases, such as potato late blight, represent the only family of microbial PFTs that effectively damage plant cells by disrupting the integrity of the plant plasma membrane. Recent research has elucidated the molecular mechanism of NLP-mediated membrane damage, which is unique among microbial PFTs and highly adapted to the plant membrane environment. In this review, we cover recent insight into how NLP cytolysins damage plant membranes and cause cell death.
