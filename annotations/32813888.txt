From global food security to textile production and biofuels, the demands currently made on plant photosynthetic productivity will continue to increase. Enhancing photosynthesis using designer, green and sustainable materials offers an attractive alternative to current genetic-based strategies and promising work with nanomaterials has recently started to emerge. Here we describe the in planta use of carbon-based nanoparticles produced by low-cost renewable routes that are bioavailable to mature plants. Uptake of these functionalised nanoparticles directly from the soil improves photosynthesis and also increases crop production. We show for the first time that glucose functionalisation enhances nanoparticle uptake, photoprotection and pigment production, unlocking enhanced yields. This was demonstrated in Triticum aestivum 'Apogee' (dwarf bread wheat) and resulted in an 18% increase in grain yield. This establishes the viability of a functional nanomaterial to augment photosynthesis as a route to increased crop productivity.
