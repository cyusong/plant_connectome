Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the first biochemical step of the carbon-concentrating mechanism of C<sub>4</sub> plants, and in C<sub>4</sub> monocots it has been suggested that CA activity is near limiting for photosynthesis. Here, we test this hypothesis through the characterization of transposon-induced mutant alleles of Ca1 and Ca2 in maize (Zea mays). These two isoforms account for more than 85% of the CA transcript pool. A significant change in isotopic discrimination is observed in mutant plants, which have as little as 3% of wild-type CA activity, but surprisingly, photosynthesis is not reduced under current or elevated CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure (pCO<sub>2</sub>). However, growth and rates of photosynthesis under subambient pCO<sub>2</sub> are significantly impaired in the mutants. These findings suggest that, while CA is not limiting for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in maize at current pCO<sub>2</sub>, it likely maintains high rates of photosynthesis when CO<sub>2</sub> availability is reduced. Current atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels now exceed 400 ppm (approximately 40.53 Pa) and contrast with the low-pCO<sub>2</sub> conditions under which C<sub>4</sub> plants expanded their range approximately 10 million years ago, when the global atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> was below 300 ppm (approximately 30.4 Pa). Thus, as CO<sub>2</sub> levels continue to rise, selective pressures for high levels of CA may be limited to arid climates where stomatal closure reduces CO<sub>2</sub> availability to the leaf.
