Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule regulating several plant developmental and stress responses. Here, we report that NO plays an important role in seed oil content and fatty acid composition. RNAi silencing of Arabidopsis S-nitrosoglutathione reductase 1 (GSNOR1) led to reduced seed oil content. In contrast, nitrate reductase double mutant nia1nia2 had increased seed oil content, compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the concentrations of palmitic acid (C16:0), linoleic acid (C18:2), and linolenic acid (C18:3) were higher, whereas those of stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), and arachidonic acid (C20:1) were lower, in seeds of GSNOR1 RNAi lines. Similar results were obtained with rapeseed embryos cultured in vitro with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and the NO inhibitor NG-Nitro-L-arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME). Compared with non-treated embryos, the oil content decreased in SNP-treated embryos, and increased in L-NAME-treated embryos. Relative concentrations of C16:0, C18:2 and C18:3 were higher, whereas C18:1 concentration decreased in rapeseed embryos treated with SNP. Proteomics and transcriptome analysis revealed that three S-nitrosated proteins and some key genes involved in oil synthesis, were differentially regulated in SNP-treated embryos. Therefore, regulating NO content could be a novel approach to increasing seed oil content in cultivated oil crops.
