The variability of the developmental responses of two contrasting cultivars of pea (Pisum sativum) was studied in relation to the genetic diversity of their nitrogen-fixing symbiont Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae. A sample of 42 strains of pea rhizobia was chosen to represent 17 genotypes predominating in indigenous rhizobial populations, the genotypes being defined by the combination of haplotypes characterized with rDNA intergenic spacer and nodD gene regions as markers. We found contrasting effects of the bacterial genotype, especially the nod gene type, on the development of nodules, roots and shoots. A bacterial nod gene type was identified that induced very large, branched nodules, smaller nodule numbers, high nodule biomass, but reduced root and aerial part development. The plants associated with this genotype accumulated less N in shoots, but N concentration in leaves was not affected. The results suggest that the plant could not control nodule development sustaining the energy demand for nodule functioning and its optimal growth. The molecular and physiological mechanisms that may be involved are discussed.
