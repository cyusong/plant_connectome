<i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i> (barnyardgrass) is one of the most damaging weeds in rice fields worldwide. Allelopathy has been considered a possible application for weed management. Thus understanding its molecular mechanisms is important for rice production. This study generated transcriptomes from rice under mono- and co-culture with barnyardgrass at two-time points to identify the candidate genes controlling allelopathic interactions between rice and barnyardgrass. A total of 5,684 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, amongst which 388 genes were transcription factors. These DEGs include genes associated with momilactone and phenolic acid biosynthesis, which play critical roles in allelopathy. Additionally, we found significantly more DEGs at 3 hours than at 3 days, suggesting a quick allelopathic response in rice. Up-regulated DEGs involve diverse biological processes, such as response to stimulus and pathways related to phenylpropanoid and secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Down-regulated DEGs were involved in developmental processes, indicating a balance between growth and stress response to allelopathy from barnyardgrass. Comparison of DEGs between rice and barnyardgrass shows few common genes, suggesting different mechanisms underlying allelopathic interaction in these two species. Our results offer an important basis for identifying of candidate genes responsible for rice and barnyardgrass interactions and contribute valuable resources for revealing its molecular mechanisms.
