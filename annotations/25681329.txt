['25681329', "Seed germination is a critical step in a plant's life cycle that allows  successful propagation and is therefore strictly controlled by endogenous and  environmental signals. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying germination  control remain elusive. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) glutamate receptor homolog3.5 (AtGLR3.5) is predominantly expressed in  germinating seeds and increases cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that counteracts the  effect of abscisic acid (ABA) to promote germination. Repression of AtGLR3.5  impairs cytosolic Ca2+ concentration elevation, significantly delays germination,  and enhances ABA sensitivity in seeds, whereas overexpression of AtGLR3.5 results  in earlier germination and reduced seed sensitivity to ABA. Furthermore, we show  that Ca2+ suppresses the expression of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4), a key  transcription factor involved in ABA response in seeds, and that ABI4 plays a  fundamental role in modulation of Ca2+-dependent germination. Taken together, our  results provide molecular genetic evidence that AtGLR3.5-mediated Ca2+ influx  stimulates seed germination by antagonizing the inhibitory effects of ABA through  suppression of ABI4. These findings establish, to our knowledge, a new and  pivotal role of the plant glutamate receptor homolog and Ca2+ signaling in  germination control and uncover the orchestrated modulation of the  AtGLR3.5-mediated Ca2+ signal and ABA signaling via ABI4 to fine-tune the crucial  developmental process, germination, in Arabidopsis.", '2015 Apr', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.114.251298', 'Kwak']
