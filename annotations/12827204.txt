['12827204', 'Far-red light regulates many aspects of seedling development, such as inhibition  of hypocotyl elongation and the promotion of greening, acting in part through  phytochrome A (phyA). The RING motif protein COP1 is also important because cop1  mutants exhibit constitutive photomorphogenesis in darkness. COP1 is present in  the nucleus in darkness but is gradually relocated to the cytoplasm upon  illumination. Here we show that COP1 functions as an E3 ligase ubiquitinating  both itself and the myb transcription activator LAF1, which is required for  complete phyA responses. In transgenic plants, inducible COP1 overexpression  leads to a decrease in LAF1 concentrations, but is blocked by the proteasome  inhibitor MG132. The coiled-coil domain of SPA1, a negative regulator of phyA  signalling, has no effect on COP1 auto-ubiquitination but facilitates LAF1  ubiquitination at low COP1 concentrations. These results indicate that, in  darkness, COP1 functions as a repressor of photomorphogenesis by promoting the  ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of a subset of positive regulators, including  LAF1. After the activation of phyA, SPA1 stimulates the E3 activity of residual  nuclear COP1 to ubiquitinate LAF1, thereby desensitizing phyA signals.', '2003 Jun 26', 'Nature', '10.1038/nature01696', 'Chua']
