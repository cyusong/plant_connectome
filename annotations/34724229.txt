FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) is a well-known MADS-box transcription factor that is required for preventing early flowering under low temperatures in Arabidopsis thaliana. Alternative splicing of FLM is involved in the regulation of temperature-responsive flowering. However, how the basic transcript level of FLM is regulated is largely unknown. Here, we conducted forward genetic screening and identified a previously uncharacterized flowering repressor gene, UBA2c. Genetic analyses indicated that UBA2c represses flowering at least by promoting FLM transcription. We further demonstrated that UBA2c directly binds to FLM chromatin and facilitates FLM transcription by inhibiting histone H3K27 trimethylation, a histone marker related to transcriptional repression. UBA2c encodes a protein containing two putative RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and one prion-like domain (PrLD). We found that UBA2c forms speckles in the nucleus and that both the RRMs and PrLD are required not only for forming the nuclear speckles but also for the biological function of UBA2c. These results identify a previously unknown flowering repressor and provide insights into the regulation of flowering time.
