['11487688', 'The KNAT2 (for KNOTTED-like from Arabidopsis thaliana 2) homeobox gene is  expressed in the vegetative apical meristem. It is also active during flower  development, suggesting a function in the structuring of flowers. To investigate  its role, we used a DEXAMETHASONE (DEX)-inducible system to generate transgenic  plants that overexpressed a fusion of KNAT2 with the hormone binding domain of  the glucocorticoid receptor. DEX-induced plants were similar to plants  overexpressing the closely related KNAT1 gene, indicating overlapping functions,  although we observed differences as well. In particular, KNAT2-GR activation  induced ectopic carpel features. First, KNAT2 induced the homeotic conversion of  nucellus into carpel-like structures. Second, KNAT2 induced stigmatic papillae on  rosette leaves in the ap2-5 background. Third, ectopic expression of the carpel  identity gene AGAMOUS (AG) was observed in carpels and ovules. Interestingly, the  homeotic conversion was not dependent on AG activity, because it was maintained  in the ag-1 ap2-5 double mutant. Therefore, our data indicate that KNAT2 also  must activate other carpel regulators. Together, these results suggest that KNAT2  plays a role in carpel development.', '2001 Aug', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.010184', 'Traas']
