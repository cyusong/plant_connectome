['15329494', 'Centromere protein C (CENP-C) is a component of the kinetochore essential for  correct segregation of sister chromatids in mammals. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a  single-copy gene encoding a protein homologous to CENP-C has been found by  homology in the whole-genome sequence. To investigate the CENP-C homolog  (AtCENP-C), we cloned cDNAs by RT-PCR and determined its full-length coding  sequence. Antibodies against the synthetic peptide for the C-terminal residues of  AtCENP-C detected a polypeptide in Arabidopsis cell extracts on western blots.  Immunofluorescence labeling with the antibodies and fluorescence in situ  hybridization demonstrated clearly that AtCENP-C is present at the centromeric  regions throughout the cell cycle.', '2004 Jun', 'Genes Genet Syst', '10.1266/ggs.79.139', 'Murata']
