Stilbene synthase (STS) is the key enzyme leading to the biosynthesis of resveratrol. Recently we reported two R2R3-MYB transcription factor (TF) genes that regulate the stilbene biosynthetic pathway in grapevine: VviMYB14 and VviMYB15. These genes are strongly co-expressed with STS genes under a range of stress and developmental conditions, in agreement with the specific activation of STS promoters by these TFs. Genome-wide gene co-expression analysis using two separate transcriptome compendia based on microarray and RNA sequencing data revealed that WRKY TFs were the top TF family correlated with STS genes. On the basis of correlation frequency, four WRKY genes, namely VviWRKY03, VviWRKY24, VviWRKY43 and VviWRKY53, were further shortlisted and functionally validated. Expression analyses under both unstressed and stressed conditions, together with promoter-luciferase reporter assays, suggested different hierarchies for these TFs in the regulation of the stilbene biosynthetic pathway. In particular, VviWRKY24 seems to act as a singular effector in the activation of the VviSTS29 promoter, while VviWRKY03 acts through a combinatorial effect with VviMYB14, suggesting that these two regulators may interact at the protein level as previously reported in other species.
