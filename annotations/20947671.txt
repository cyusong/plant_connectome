The abscission process is initiated by changes in the auxin gradient across the abscission zone (AZ) and is triggered by ethylene. Although changes in gene expression have been correlated with the ethylene-mediated execution of abscission, there is almost no information on the molecular and biochemical basis of the increased AZ sensitivity to ethylene. We examined transcriptome changes in the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum 'Shiran 1335') flower AZ during the rapid acquisition of ethylene sensitivity following flower removal, which depletes the AZ from auxin, with or without preexposure to 1-methylcyclopropene or application of indole-3-acetic acid after flower removal. Microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Tomato GeneChip revealed changes in expression, occurring prior to and during pedicel abscission, of many genes with possible regulatory functions. They included a range of auxin- and ethylene-related transcription factors, other transcription factors and regulatory genes that are transiently induced early, 2 h after flower removal, and a set of novel AZ-specific genes. All gene expressions initiated by flower removal and leading to pedicel abscission were inhibited by indole-3-acetic acid application, while 1-methylcyclopropene pretreatment inhibited only the ethylene-induced expressions, including those induced by wound-associated ethylene signals. These results confirm our hypothesis that acquisition of ethylene sensitivity in the AZ is associated with altered expression of auxin-regulated genes resulting from auxin depletion. Our results shed light on the regulatory control of abscission at the molecular level and further expand our knowledge of auxin-ethylene cross talk during the initial controlling stages of the process.
