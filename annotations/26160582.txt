['26160582', 'Lipid modification on the cysteine residues of proteins, known as  S-palmitoylation or S-acylation, regulates the subcellular localization and the  function of proteins. S-acylation is catalysed by a group of protein  acyltransferases (PATs) with a conserved Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif. The  molecular function of S-acylation has been studied in details in yeast and  mammalian cells, but its role in plant cells remains unclear. Here it is reported  that the expression of two homologous protein acyltransferases- PAT13 and PAT14  -was moderately increased in the older leaves of Arabidopsis. The double mutant  of PAT13 and PAT14 displayed a severely early leaf senescence phenotype. The  phenotype was complemented by PAT13 or PAT14 overexpression in the double mutant,  confirming the roles of PAT13 and PAT14 in this process. Furthermore, the levels  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death were dramatically induced in the  double mutant. To investigate the molecular functions of PAT13 and PAT14, their  potential S-acylation substrates were predicted by bioinformatics methods. The  subcellular localization and S-acylation of a candidate substrate NITRIC OXIDE  ASSOCIATED 1 (NOA1), which also plays a role in leaf senescence control, were  partially disrupted in the protoplasts of the double mutant. Impairment of  S-acylation on NOA1 affected its subcellular localization and its function in  leaf senescence regulation. Conclusively, protein S-acyltransferases PAT13 and  PAT14 are involved in leaf senescence control- possibly via NOA1 S-acylation-,  providing a new sight into the regulation mechanism of S-acylation in leaf  senescence.', '2015 Oct', 'J Exp Bot', '10.1093/jxb/erv347', 'Yang']
