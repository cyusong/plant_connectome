N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation) is one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotes. The function of Naa50, the catalytic subunit of the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal acetyltransferase (Nat) E complex, has not been reported in Arabidopsis. In this study, we found that a loss of Naa50 resulted in a pleiotropic phenotype that included dwarfism and sterility, premature leaf senescence and a shortened primary root. Further analysis revealed that root cell patterning and various root cell properties were severely impaired in naa50 mutant plants. Moreover, defects in auxin distribution were observed due to the mislocalization of PIN auxin transporters. In contrast to its homologs in yeast and animals, Naa50 showed no co-immunoprecipitation with any subunit of the Nat A complex. Moreover, plants lacking Naa50 displayed hypersensitivity to abscisic acid and osmotic stress. Therefore, our results suggest that protein N-terminal acetylation catalyzed by Naa50 plays an essential role in Arabidopsis growth and osmotic stress responses.
