['9451956', "A secondary screen of the Feldmann collection of T-DNA transformed Arabidopsis  lines identified several meiotic mutants. We used a spreading technique combined  with DAPI staining in a detailed cytogenetic analysis of meiotic chromosome  behaviour in four of these mutants, all of which are putatively T-DNA tagged and  therefore candidates for molecular and functional analysis of the mutated genes.  Two of them are defined as 'synaptic' mutants, showing greatly reduced  association of homologous chromosomes at metaphase I: one is asynaptic, showing  failure of synapsis during prophase I, whereas the other is desynaptic and is  characterized by normal but non-maintained synapsis. Another mutant is defective  in meiotic cell cycle control and undergoes a third meiotic division, resembling  a second division but without an additional round of chromosome duplication. A  further mutant shows meiosis-limited chromosome disruption, resulting in  extensive chromosome fragmentation combined with other defects. All four mutants  experience very irregular chromosome distribution during the meiotic divisions,  resulting in abnormal numbers and/or sizes of microspores, with resulting reduced  fertility.", '1997 Dec', 'Chromosome Res', '10.1023/a:1018497804129', 'Jones']
