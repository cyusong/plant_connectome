['30413616', 'The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is an essential tubular-vesicular organelle derived  from the Golgi and functions as an independent sorting and trafficking hub within  the cell. However, the molecular regulation of TGN biogenesis remains enigmatic.  Here we identified an Arabidopsis mutant loss of TGN (lot) that is defective in  TGN formation and sterile due to impaired pollen tube growth in the style. The  mutation leads to overstacking of the Golgi cisternae and significant reduction  in the number of TGNs and vesicles surrounding the Golgi in pollen, which is  corroborated by the dispersed cytosolic distribution of TGN-localized proteins.  Consistently, deposition of extracellular pectin and plasma membrane localization  of kinases and phosphoinositide species are also impaired. Subcellular  localization analysis suggests that LOT is localized on the periphery of the  Golgi cisternae, but the mutation does not affect the localization of  Golgi-resident proteins. Furthermore, the yeast complementation result suggests  that LOT could functionally act as a component of the guanine nucleotide exchange  factor (GEF) complex of small Rab GTPase Ypt6. Taken together, these findings  suggest that LOT is a critical player for TGN biogenesis in the plant lineage.', '2018 Nov 27', 'Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A', '10.1073/pnas.1809206115', 'ORCID:']
