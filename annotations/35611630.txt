Plants developing into the flowering stage undergo major physiological changes. Because flowers are reproductive tissues and resource sinks, strategies to defend them may differ from those for leaves. Thus, this study investigates the defences of flowering plants by assessing processes that sustain resistance (constitutive and induced) and tolerance to attack. We exposed the annual plant Brassica nigra to three distinct floral attackers (caterpillar, aphid마nd bacterial pathogen)마nd measured whole-plant responses at 4, 8마nd 12 days after the attack. We simultaneously analysed profiles of primary and secondary metabolites in leaves and inflorescences마nd measured dry biomass of roots, leaves마nd inflorescences as proxies of resource allocation and regrowth. Regardless of treatments, inflorescences contained 1.2 to 4 times higher concentrations of primary metabolites than leaves, and up to 7 times higher concentrations of glucosinolates, which highlights the plant's high investment of resources into inflorescences. No induction of glucosinolates was detected in inflorescences, but the attack transiently affected the total concentration of soluble sugars in both leaves and inflorescences. We conclude that B.맕igra evolved high constitutive rather than inducible resistance to protect their flowers; plants additionally compensated for damage by attackers via맚he regrowth of reproductive parts. This strategy may be typical of annual plants.
