Arabidopsis genes MYR1 and MYR2 are regulators of flowering time under low light intensity. These Myb-related genes are expressed as alternative splice variants affected in their coiled-coil and DNA-binding domains. We tested whether alternative splicing could affect dimerization and localization of MYR1 and MYR2, thereby potentially affecting their activity. Using MYR1 as a model for variants within the coiled-coil region, we detected 2 types of homodimers. For MYR2, alternative splicing in the DNA-binding Myb-like domain abolished the ability of MYR2 to dimerize. Alternative splicing in the coiled-coil domain did not affect nuclear localization, as determined by transient expression in tobacco, while alternative splicing in the DNA-binding domain of MYR2 yielded a distinct intranuclear localization pattern that may reflect changes in phosphorylation-dependent protein folding. Thus alternative splicing of these genes may result in changes in dimerization or protein folding resulting in changes in activity and abundance of MYR1 or MYR2 protein.
