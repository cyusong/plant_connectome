Plant genetic diversity can affect ecosystem functioning by enhancing productivity, litter decomposition and resistance to natural enemies. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that genetic diversity may influence ecosystem processes by eliciting functional plasticity among individuals encountering kin or genetically diverse neighbourhoods. We used soil conditioned by groups of closely related (siblings) and diverse genotypes of Deschampsia cespitosa - a species known to exhibit kin recognition via root exudation - to investigate the consequences of kin interactions for root litter decomposition and negative feedback between plants and soil biota. Genetically diverse groups produced root litter that had higher nitrogen (N) content, decomposed faster and resulted in greater N uptake by the next generation of seedlings compared with litter produced by sibling groups. However, a similar degree of negative soil feedback on plant productivity was observed in soil conditioned by siblings and genetically diverse groups. This suggests that characteristics of roots produced by sibling groups slow down N cycling but moderate the expected negative impact of soil pathogens in low-diversity stands. These findings highlight interactions between neighbouring genotypes as an overlooked mechanism by which genetic diversity can affect biotic soil feedback and nutrient cycling.
