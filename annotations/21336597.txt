['21336597', 'Limited information is available regarding the exact function of specific WRKY  transcription factors in plant responses to heat stress. We analyzed the roles of  WRKY25, WRKY26, and WRKY33, three types of group I WRKY proteins, in the  regulation of resistance to heat stress. Expression of WRKY25 and WRKY26 was  induced upon treatment with high temperature, whereas WRKY33 expression was  repressed. Heat-treated WRKY single mutants exhibited small responses, while  wrky25wrky26 and wrky25wrky33 double mutants and the wrky25wrky26wrky33 triple  mutants showed substantially increased susceptibility to heat stress, showing  reduced germination, decreased survival, and elevated electrolyte leakage,  compared with wild-type plants. In contrast, constitutive expression of WRKY25,  WRKY26, or WRKY33 enhanced resistance to heat stress. Expression studies of  selected heat-defense genes in single, double, and triple mutants, as well as in  over-expressing lines, were correlated with their thermotolerance phenotypes and  demonstrated that the three WRKY transcription factors modulate transcriptional  changes of heat-inducible genes in response to heat treatment. In addition, our  findings provided evidence that WRKY25, WRKY26, and WRKY33 were involved in  regulation of the heat-induced ethylene-dependent response and demonstrated  positive cross-regulation within these three genes. Together, these results  indicate that WRKY25, WRKY26, and WRKY33 positively regulate the cooperation  between the ethylene-activated and heat shock proteins-related signaling pathways  that mediate responses to heat stress; and that these three proteins interact  functionally and play overlapping and synergetic roles in plant thermotolerance.', '2011 Jun', 'Planta', '10.1007/s00425-011-1375-2', 'Yu']
