Myrosin cells accumulate myrosinases in their vacuoles to catalyze the production of toxic compounds when tissues are damaged by herbivores. Myrosin cells are positioned adjacent to the abaxial side of the vasculature but their origin is unclear. To determine whether the myrosin cells are differentiated from vascular precursor cells, we generated a transgenic Arabidopsis line that expressed a myrosin cell reporter together with one of 3 vascular precursor cell reporters. The myrosin-positive cells were discontinuously distributed while the vascular precursor-positive cells were continuously distributed. The fluorescent signals of the myosin and vascular reporters did not overlap. Furthermore, the shape of myrosin-positive cells was different from the shape of vascular precursor-positive cells. These results indicate that myosin cells develop independently of the vasculature.
