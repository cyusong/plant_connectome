Abscisic acid (ABA) plays important roles in positively or negatively regulating plant disease resistance to pathogens. Here, we reassess the role of endogenous and exogenous ABA by using: 35S::<i>ABA2</i>, a previously reported transgenic <i>Arabidopsis</i> line with increased endogenous ABA levels; <i>aba2-1</i>, a previously reported <i>ABA2</i> mutant with reduced endogenous ABA levels; and exogenous application of ABA. We found that bacterial susceptibility promoted by exogenous ABA was suppressed in 35S::<i>ABA2</i> plants. The 35S::<i>ABA2</i> and <i>aba2-1</i> plants displayed elevated and reduced levels, respectively, of bacterial flagellin peptide (flg22)-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Surprisingly, ABA pre-treatment reduced flg22-induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation. Exogenous, but not endogenous ABA, increased catalase activity. Loss of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase genes, <i>RBOHD</i> and <i>RBOHF</i>, restored exogenous ABA-promoted bacterial susceptibility of 35S::<i>ABA2</i> transgenic plants. In addition, endogenous and exogenous ABA had similar effects on callose deposition and salicylic acid (SA) signaling. These results reveal an underlying difference between endogenous and exogenous ABA in regulating plant defense responses. Given that some plant pathogens are able to synthesize ABA and affect endogenous ABA levels in plants, our results highlight the importance of reactive oxygen species in the dual function of ABA during plant-pathogen interactions.
