High mobility group (HMG) proteins are usually considered ubiquitous components of the eukaryotic chromatin. Using HMG gene promoter-GUS reporter gene fusions we have examined the expression of the reporter gene in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. These experiments have revealed that the different HMGA and HMGB promoters display overlapping patterns of activity, but they also show tissue- and developmental stage-specific differences. Moreover, leader introns that are present in some of the HMGB genes can modulate reporter gene expression. The differential HMG gene expression supports the view that the various HMG proteins serve partially different architectural functions in plant chromatin.
