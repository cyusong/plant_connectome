Wheat is one of the most important crops in the world. Its production can be influenced by a diversity of beneficial and pathogenic rhizospheric microbes, including fungi. Amongst them, beneficial <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. can be used as alternatives to chemical fertilizers, as they are cheap and harmless to the environment. Our study aimed to isolate, identify, and characterize <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. from Lebanon associated with wheat. Two <i>Trichoderma</i> strains belonging to <i>T. afroharzianum</i>, and <i>T. guizhouense</i> species, were isolated and found to be endophytes, enhancing root growth and producing Indole-3-acetic acid. Inoculation also improved seedling development, and increased plant growth and yield. Furthermore, the two strains inhibit Fusarium growth <i>in vitro</i>. These <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. have thus the capacity to be used as organic fertilizers for wheat.
