Diverse gene products including phytotoxins, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and type III secreted effectors influence interactions between Pseudomonas syringae strains and plants, with additional yet uncharacterized factors likely contributing as well. Of particular interest are those interactions governing pathogen-host specificity. Comparative genomics of closely related pathogens with different host specificity represents an excellent approach for identification of genes contributing to host-range determination. A draft genome sequence of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato T1, which is pathogenic on tomato but nonpathogenic on Arabidopsis thaliana, was obtained for this purpose and compared with the genome of the closely related A. thaliana and tomato model pathogen P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000. Although the overall genetic content of each of the two genomes appears to be highly similar, the repertoire of effectors was found to diverge significantly. Several P. syringae pv. tomato T1 effectors absent from strain DC3000 were confirmed to be translocated into plants, with the well-studied effector AvrRpt2 representing a likely candidate for host-range determination. However, the presence of avrRpt2 was not found sufficient to explain A. thaliana resistance to P. syringae pv. tomato T1, suggesting that other effectors and possibly type III secretion system-independent factors also play a role in this interaction.
