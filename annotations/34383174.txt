The spore-forming Bacillus and Paenibacillus species represent the phyla of beneficial bacteria for application as agricultural inputs in form of effective phytostimulators, biofertilizers, and biocontrol agents. The members of the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus isolated from several ecological habitats are been thoroughly dissected for their effective application in the development of sustainable and eco-friendly agriculture. Numerous Bacillus and Paenibacillus species are reported as plant growth-promoting bacteria influencing the health and productivity of the food crops. This review narrates the mechanisms utilized by these species to enhance bioavailability and/or facilitate the acquisition of nutrients by the host plant, modulate plant hormones, stimulate host defense and stress resistance mechanisms, exert antagonistic action against soil and airborne pathogens, and alleviate the plant health. The mechanisms employed by Bacillus and Paenibacillus are seldom mutually exclusive. The comprehensive and systematic exploration of the aforementioned mechanisms in conjunction with the field investigations may assist in the exploration and selection of an effective biofertilizer and a biocontrol agent. This review aims to gather and discuss the literature citing the applications of Bacillus and Paenibacillus in the management of sustainable agriculture.
