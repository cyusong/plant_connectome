Difficulties quantifying pathogen load and mutualist abundance limit our ability to connect disease dynamics to host community ecology. For example, specific predictions about how differential pathogen load is hypothesised to drive host competitive outcomes are rarely tested. Additionally, although infection is known to affect mutualists, we rarely measure the magnitude of pathogen effects on mutualist abundance across host competitive contexts. We tested for both mechanisms in a plant-rhizobia-nematode system. We paired the legume Medicago lupulina with intraspecific and interspecific plant competitors, with and without a generalist nematode parasite Meloidogyne sp. Relative change in plant biomass was used to determine how nematode inoculation affected plant competitive outcomes. We counted nematode galls to test for direct effects of parasitism on plant competition and rhizobia nodules to test for indirect effects of nematode presence on rhizobium abundance. Parasites were destabilising despite similar nematode load across competition treatments. During interspecific compared with intraspecific competition, nematode inoculation decreased nodulation on M. lupulina, increased nodulation on Trifolium repens and had no effect on nodulation on Chamaecrista fasciculata. We found no support for hypothesised direct effects of nematode load on competitive outcomes and strong but idiosyncratic indirect effects of nematode inoculation on rhizobium abundance.
