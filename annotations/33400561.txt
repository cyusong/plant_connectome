The root lesion nematode <i>Pratylenchus penetrans</i> is a migratory species that attacks a broad range of crops. Like other plant pathogens, <i>P. penetrans</i> deploys a battery of secreted protein effectors to manipulate plant hosts and induce disease. Although several candidate effectors of <i>P. penetrans</i> have been identified, detailed mechanisms of their functions and particularly their host targets remain largely unexplored. In this study, a repertoire of candidate genes encoding pioneer effectors of <i>P. penetrans</i> was amplified from mixed life stages of the nematode, and candidate effectors were cloned and subjected to transient expression in a heterologous host, <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, using potato virus X-based gene vector. Among seven analyzed genes, the candidate effector designated as <i>Ppen10370</i> triggered pleiotropic phenotypes substantially different from those produced by wild type infection. Transcriptome analysis of plants expressing <i>Ppen10370</i> demonstrated that observed phenotypic changes were likely related to disruption of core biological processes in the plant due to effector-originated activities. Cross-species comparative analysis of <i>Ppen10370</i> identified homolog gene sequences in five other <i>Pratylenchus</i> species, and their transcripts were found to be localized specifically in the nematode esophageal glands by in situ hybridization. RNA silencing of the <i>Ppen10370</i> resulted in a significant reduction of nematode reproduction and development, demonstrating an important role of the esophageal gland effector for parasitism.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).
