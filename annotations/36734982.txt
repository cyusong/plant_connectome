The oomycete <i>Phytophthora palmivora</i> infects a wide range of tropical crops worldwide. Like other filamentous plant pathogens, it secretes effectors to colonise plant tissues. Here we characterise FIRE, an RXLR effector that contains a canonical mode I 14-3-3 phospho-sensor binding motif that is conserved in effectors of several <i>Phytophthora</i> species. FIRE is phosphorylated in planta and interacts with multiple 14-3-3 proteins. Binding is sensitive to the R18 14-3-3 inhibitor. FIRE promotes plant susceptibility and co-localises with its target around haustoria. This work uncovers a new type of oomycete effector target mechanism. It demonstrates that substrate mimicry for 14-3-3 proteins is a cross-kingdom effector strategy used by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic plant pathogens to suppress host immunity.
