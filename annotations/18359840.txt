['18359840', 'The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) sucrose transporter AtSUC1 (At1g71880) is  highly expressed in pollen; however, its function has remained unknown. Here, we  show that suc1 mutant pollen is defective in vivo, as evidenced by segregation  distortion, and also has low rates of germination in vitro. AtSUC1-green  fluorescent protein was localized to the plasma membrane in pollen tubes. AtSUC1  is also expressed in roots and external application of sucrose increased AtSUC1  expression in roots. AtSUC1 is important for sucrose-dependent signaling leading  to anthocyanin accumulation in seedlings. suc1 mutants accumulated less  anthocyanins in response to exogenous sucrose or maltose and microarray analysis  revealed reduced expression of many genes important for anthocyanin biosynthesis.  The results indicate that AtSUC1 is important for sugar signaling in vegetative  tissue and for normal male gametophyte function.', '2008 May', 'Plant Physiol', '10.1104/pp.108.118992', 'Ward']
