['15208394', 'Experiments with several Arabidopsis thaliana mutants have revealed a web of  interactions between hormonal signaling. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis  mutant radical-induced cell death1 (rcd1), although hypersensitive to apoplastic  superoxide and ozone, is more resistant to chloroplastic superoxide formation,  exhibits reduced sensitivity to abscisic acid, ethylene, and methyl jasmonate,  and has altered expression of several hormonally regulated genes. Furthermore,  rcd1 has higher stomatal conductance than the wild type. The rcd1-1 mutation was  mapped to the gene At1g32230 where it disrupts an intron splice site resulting in  a truncated protein. RCD1 belongs to the (ADP-ribosyl)transferase  domain-containing subfamily of the WWE protein-protein interaction domain protein  family. The results suggest that RCD1 could act as an integrative node in  hormonal signaling and in the regulation of several stress-responsive genes.', '2004 Jul', 'Plant Cell', '10.1105/tpc.021832', 'Kangasjarvi']
