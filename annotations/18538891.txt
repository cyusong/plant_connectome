The presence and properties of the enzyme xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) in peroxisomes from pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaves were studied using biochemical and immunological methods. The activity analysis showed that, in leaf peroxisomes, the superoxide-generating XOR form, xanthine oxidase (XOD), was predominant over the xanthine dehydrogenase form (XDH), with a XDH/XOD ratio of 0.5. However, in crude extracts of pea leaves, the XDH form was more abundant, with a XDH/XOD ratio of 1.6. The native molecular mass of the peroxisomal XOR determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 290 kDa. Using western blot assays, we identified an immunoreactive band of 59 kDa that was not affected by the reducing reagent DTT or endogenous proteases. The analysis of pea leaves by electron microscopy immunogold labeling with affinity-purified antibodies against rat XOD confirmed that this enzyme was localized in the matrix of peroxisomes, as well as in chloroplasts and cytosol. In pea plants subjected to abiotic stress by cadmium, the activity of the peroxisomal XOR was reduced, whereas its protein level expression increased. The results confirmed that leaf peroxisomes contain XOR, and suggest that this peroxisomal metalloflavoprotein enzyme is involved in the mechanism of response of pea plants to abiotic stress by heavy metals.
