Despite the fact that replication of plus-strand RNA viruses takes place in the cytoplasm of host cells, different proteins encoded by these infectious agents have been shown to localize in the nucleus, with high accumulation at the nucleolus. In most cases, the molecular determinants or biological significance of such subcellular localization remains elusive. Recently, we reported that protein p37 encoded by Pelargonium line pattern virus (family Tombusviridae) acts in both RNA packaging and RNA silencing suppression. Consistently with these functions, p37 was detected in the cytoplasm of plant cells, although it was also present in the nucleus and, particularly, in the nucleolus. Here, we searched for further insights into factors influencing p37 nucleolar localization and into its potential relevance for viral infection. Besides mapping the protein region containing the nucleolar localization signal, we have found that p37 interacts with distinct members of the importin alpha family-main cellular transporters for nucleo-cytoplasmic traffic of proteins-and that these interactions are crucial for nucleolar targeting of p37. Impairment of p37 nucleolar localization through downregulation of importin alpha expression resulted in a reduction of viral accumulation, suggesting that sorting of the protein to the major subnuclear compartment is advantageous for the infection process.
